Peru's health minister says an outbreak of plague has killed a
14-year-old boy and infected at least 31 people in a northern coastal
province. Health Minister Oscar Ugarte says authorities are screening
sugar and fish meal exports from Ascope province [La Libertad
region], located about 325 miles (520 km) northwest of Lima. Popular
Chicama beach isn't far away.

Ugarte says the boy, who had Down syndrome, died of bubonic plague 26
Jul 2010. He said Monday, 2 Aug 2010, that most of the infections are
bubonic plague, with 4 cases of pneumonic plague. The former is
transmitted by flea bites, the latter by airborne contagion. The
disease is curable if treated early with antibiotics.

The 1st recorded plague outbreak in Peru was in 1903. The last, in
1994, killed 35 people.

[Ascope province is located in the region of La Libertad, in
northwestern Peru. It shares a border with Trujillo province where
the disease has also been recently reported. It is not clearly stated
in the posting whether the pneumonic cases were directly acquired
from person-to-person spread or were a complication of bubonic
plague. Of note, there was an outbreak of bubonic plague reported in
Chicama district of Ascope province in April 2010, suggestive that
these current cases may be part of this previously reported outbreak
as proximity to Chicama beach is mentioned in the above newswire (see
prior ProMED-mail posting Plague, bubonic - Peru: (LL) RFI
20100428.1373). - Mods.LL/MPP]
