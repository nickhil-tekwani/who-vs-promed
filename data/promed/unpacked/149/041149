Viet Nam halts bird flu vaccination due to new type
---------------------------------------------------
The Vietnamese government said it had halted the nationwide
vaccination of poultry against bird flu, saying a new type of the H5N1
virus had rendered the vaccine ineffective.

"Based on post-vaccination surveillance results, a new clade of the
H5N1 virus has appeared in Viet Nam since 2010," the government said
in a statement issued late on Thursday [26 May 2011]. Viet Nam had
planned to use a vaccine imported from China for its vaccination this
year, but the vaccine did not work against the new variety, the Animal
Health Department said.

The new type has been circulating in northern provinces, coastal
provinces in the central region as well as in the Central Highlands,
it said. The old type of the virus remains active in southern
provinces, it said in a report this week.

Viet Nam 1st detected the H5N1 virus in poultry in 2003. The virus
has since infected 553 people in 15 countries and killed 323, most of
them in Asia, including 59 in Viet Nam, based on a World Health
Organization tally.

Health experts fear the disease could mutate to a form that could be
easily transmitted between humans. Almost all of the human H5N1
infections to date are believed to have passed from birds to humans.
Viet Nam has detected no human cases of bird flu in 2011 but several
provinces across the country have reported outbreaks in ducks and
chickens.

[The reported vaccination problem is a matter of concern to Viet Nam,
a country which opted for a policy of poultry vaccination with rather
satisfactory results. As described in a review by Domenech, Dauphin,
Rushton et al in 2009, the policy included blanket vaccination in
designated high risk provinces, conducted twice per year. Most of the
vaccine used, reportedly contained a killed antigen based on
A/Goose/Guangdong/96 in an oil adjuvant, produced in China. The review
is available at

avian influenza vaccines in posting 20050307.0680.

Details on the findings which, reportedly, have now led the
authorities to doubt the efficacy of the applied vaccines against the
prevailing HPAI H5N1 strain will be helpful. - Mod.AS
