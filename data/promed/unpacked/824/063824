Swine flu, not vaccine, may trigger narcolepsy
----------------------------------------------
In spring last year [2010], the number of narcolepsy cases in Beijing,
China, multiplied 3-fold. Now, it looks like the swine flu [A/H1N1
2009 virus] pandemic of the previous winter was to blame.

Previously, similar rises in cases of narcolepsy -- a disorder that
causes sleepiness at inappropriate times -- have been linked to use of
a swine flu vaccine. The cause was presumed to lie in the drug's
adjuvants -- additives that boost the immune response to the vaccine.

The claim puzzled researchers who saw a concurrent rise in narcolepsy
cases in China, where few people had opted to get vaccinated and those
who did received a vaccine without adjuvants. Could the flu itself be
to blame?

To find out, Fang Han and his colleagues at Beijing University
People's Hospital [and collaborators in California and Ohio] studied
the medical profiles of 906 people who had come to the hospital with
narcolepsy since 1998. The group found that, even in the years before
the vaccine was introduced in October 2009, the number of narcolepsy
cases followed a seasonal pattern -- cases dropped significantly
around November and spiked in April. The peak was higher than normal
in the spring after the swine flu pandemic

[Juliette Faraco at Stanford University's Center for Narcolepsy in
California, a co-author of the study, added a comment that the idea
that [influenza virus infection] causes narcolepsy fits in with the
theory that narcolepsy is triggered by the immune system's response to
airway infections. "There is no way to definitively say that the swine
flu virus caused narcolepsy, but we think this raises a big red flag.
The flu vaccine will protect against the flu -- if it also protects
against narcolepsy, all the better," she says.]

[Previously the Medical Products Agency (MPA) in Sweden published the
results of a case inventory carried out by the MPA in Sweden during
2009-2010. The study presented evidence to support a link between
having been vaccinated with the Pandemrix influenza vaccine and
narcolepsy in children and adolescents 19 years and younger. (See
Eurosurveillance, 30 Jun 2011; 16(26)

and the ProMED-mail posts listed below).

The publication cited in the report above is:
Han F, Lin L, Warby SC, et al: Narcolepsy onset is seasonal and
increased following the 2009 H1N1 pandemic in China. Annals of
Neurology, DOI: 10.1002/ana.22587
(http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.22587/abstract) and
the Abstract reads as follows:

"Narcolepsy is caused by the loss of hypocretin/orexin neurons in the
hypothalamus, which is likely the result of an autoimmune process.
Recently, concern has been raised over reports of narcolepsy in
northern Europe following H1N1 vaccination.

The study is a retrospective analysis of narcolepsy onset in subjects
diagnosed in Beijing, China (1998-2010). Self-reported month and year
of onset were collected from 629 patients (86 percent children).
Graphical presentation, autocorrelations, chi-square, and Fourier
analysis were used to assess monthly variation in onset. Finally, 182
patients having developed narcolepsy after October 2009 were asked for
vaccination history.

The occurrence of narcolepsy onset was seasonal, significantly
influenced by month and calendar year. Onset was least frequent in
November and most frequent in April, with a 6.7-fold increase from
trough to peak. Studying year-to-year variation, we found a 3-fold
increase in narcolepsy onset following the 2009 H1N1 winter influenza
pandemic. The increase is unlikely to be explained by increased
vaccination, as only 8 of 142 (5.6 percent) patients recalled
receiving an H1N1 vaccination. Cross-correlation indicated a
significant 5- to 7-month delay between the seasonal peak in
influenza/cold or H1N1 infections and peak in narcolepsy onset
occurrences. It is concluded that in China, narcolepsy onset is highly
correlated with seasonal and annual patterns of upper airway
infections, including H1N1 influenza. In 2010, the peak seasonal onset
of narcolepsy was phase delayed by 6 months relative to winter H1N1
infections, and the correlation was independent of H1N1 vaccination in
the majority of the sample."

It seems reasonable to conclude, therefore, that if narcolepsy is
triggered by immune system responses it may be induced either by virus
infection or as a consequence of vaccination. - Mod.CP]
