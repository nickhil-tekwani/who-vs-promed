Folkhalsomyndigheten, or Sweden's Public Health Agency, reported 30 cases of shigellosis with a travel connection to Cape Verde have been reported in Sweden since mid-November 2022. A total of 11 bacterial isolates have so far been determined to species: 9 _Shigella sonnei_ and 2 _Shigella boydii_. The spread of infection in Cape Verde has also been noticed by several other European countries and taken up with the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO).

Among Swedish travelers, infections with other intestinal pathogens, for example, enterohemorrhagic _Escherichia coli_, campylobacter, cryptosporidium and giardia, have also been noted. Infection with shigella in connection with trips to Cape Verde has been a recurring problem. This and the presence of various _Shigella_ species and other intestinal pathogens suggest contamination via food.

Shigella bacteria are found in stool, and infection is spread by eating food or drinking liquids contaminated by an infected person, or when a person touches a contaminated surface or object and then touches their mouth or puts the object into their mouth. People infected with shigellosis typically experience a fever, abdominal cramps and diarrhea which may be bloody. Shigellosis symptoms usually appear 1 to 2 days after exposure -- but may take longer -- and last around a week. Most people with shigellosis recover completely without severe complications. In rare cases, shigella may cause bloodstream infections, seizures, kidney failure or arthritis.

[Shigella was discovered more than 100 years ago by the Japanese microbiologist Kiyoshi Shiga, for whom the genus is named. There are 4 species: _S. boydii_, _S. dysenteriae_, _S. flexneri_, and _S. sonnei_. Shigella organisms can survive transit through the stomach because they are less susceptible to acid than other bacteria; for this reason, as few as 10-100 organisms can cause disease. Ingested bacteria pass into the small intestine where they multiply; large numbers of bacteria then pass into the colon, where they enter the colonic cells. Given its relatively low infectious dose, transmission can occur via contaminated food and water or via direct person-to-person spread, including sexual practices more common in men who have sex with men. Humans are the only natural reservoir for the disease.

The bacterium is the classical cause of bacterial dysentery (formerly known as flux or the bloody flux), an inflammatory disorder of the colon that results in severe diarrhea containing mucus and/or blood in the feces with fever, abdominal pain, and rectal tenesmus (pain while passing diarrhea).

Abstract
--------
"Shigellosis is a clinical syndrome caused by invasion of the epithelium lining the terminal ileum, colon, and rectum by _Shigella_ species. Although infections occur globally, and in people of all ages, endemic infections among children aged 1-4 years living in low-income and middle-income settings constitute most of the disease burden. The versatile manifestations of these highly contagious organisms range from acute watery diarrhoea to fulminant dysentery characterised by frequent scant bloody stools with fever, prostration, and abdominal cramps. A broad array of uncommon, but often severe, intestinal and extraintestinal complications can occur. Despite marked reductions in mortality during the past 3 decades, there are roughly 164 000 annual deaths attributable to shigellosis. Intercontinental dissemination of multiresistant _Shigella_ strains, facilitated by travellers and men who have sex with men, has prompted new recommendations for antibiotic therapy. Awareness of disease burden and the emerging threats posed by shigella have accelerated interest in development of shigella vaccines, many of which are being tested in clinical trials." - Mod.LL
