[Since the end of August 2020, H5N8 highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses have been detected in wild bird and poultry species in Russia, Kazakhstan, Israel, European Union countries, South Korea and Japan. Introductions of HPAIVs circulating in Europe into Japan are believed to be caused by migratory birds, such as the white-fronted goose. These species of migratory wild birds tend to winter in Europe and breed in Siberia during the summer, where they may co-mingle with migratory birds that winter in Asia. - Mod.PMB
