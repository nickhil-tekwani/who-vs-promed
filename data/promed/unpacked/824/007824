China: Avian Influenza and Foot and Mouth Disease Control Measures
-----------------------------------------------
China has halted the spread of avian influenza and foot-and-mouth disease
(FMD), which were recently discovered in animals and birds. CRI reporter
Xiaoyu tells us how the Ministry of Agriculture has been able to contain
the problem. FMD was discovered in 4 regions in China during April and May
2005. An outbreak of avian influenza has killed more than 1000 wild birds
in west China.
FMD is highly contagious among cattle and other cloven-hoofed animals. Once
it was discovered, the local and central agricultural departments
immediately began investigating and launched their emergency plan. At
Friday's news conference [27 May 2005], Chinese chief veterinarian Jia
Youling from China's Ministry of Agriculture said the government has been
successful in preventing any further spread of the disease. "We immediately
closed off affected spots and surrounding regions. The expert team was sent
to supervise the strict disinfection efforts. Scientists from the national
lab then collected samples for further epidemiological studies. Emergent
vaccination is conducted in all these regions." In total, over 4000 cattle
have been killed or culled, including more than 500 on a farm in Hebei
province. Though they had no symptoms of the disease, the monitoring system
reported the virus as found in the herd. All the cattle in these regions
have been vaccinated, and feeding cattle in the coming 6 months are
forbidden on farms discovered with the disease. Farmers whose animals are
killed or culled are compensated 4000-6000 yuan [USD 483-725] per cow. This
is the 1st time Asian type I FMD has been discovered in China. The virus
cannot be transmitted to humans. The source of the virus has not been traced.
In response to the recent avian influenza outbreak in Qinghai province, the
chief veterinarian says the birds killed came from south and central Asia,
so other parts of China should not be affected. "There are 3 major
migrating routes for birds in China. The recent outbreak appeared in the
western route, from south and central Asian countries to the northern part
of the Indian Peninsula then over Tibet and the Himalayas to Qinghai
province. Because the bar-headed geese that were killed most in this
outbreak were only found on this route, so other parts of China won't be
affected."
The virus, which has killed more than 1000 migrating birds, is being
collected from dead birds, but scientists haven't found any similar gene
like that in the H5N1 virus that can be transmitted to humans. Jia Youling
says reports of avian influenza spreading to people in the province is
unfounded.
A series of measures have been taken to prevent the spread from wild to
domestic birds and humans. The government ordered all ducks, geese and
other poultry in the province to be vaccinated. All nature reserves in the
province were closed to the public, and farms near bird migration routes
elsewhere were ordered to vaccinate poultry.
China experienced a large-scale outbreak of avian influenza last year
[2004], and hundreds of thousands of birds were culled. Experts have warned
that the avian influenza virus [could] evolve to spread rapidly between
humans, sparking a global epidemic that will hit developing countries hardest.

Chinese government held a press conference to announce that 1000 birds were
found dead. - Mod.MPP]

China; Avian Influenza (H5N1) In Wild Birds
---------
There are recent reports of highly pathogenic avian influenza (H5N1) from
Qinghai Nature Preserve, west of Xining, Qinghai Province, China, a
significant extension of the known affected area for this disease. Previous
to this report, the current H5N1 outbreak was thought to be contained in
Southeast Asia. See
<http://www.wpro.who.int/avian%5Fflu/images/asia_spawn.htm>.
Why is this a conservation issue?
---------
Avian influenza forms a threat to wild bird conservation on several fronts.
1st, although most strains of avian influenza are relatively benign, H5N1
appears to be able to cause illness and death in wild birds. 2nd, some
public and animal health officials will blame wild birds for spreading
H5N1, and there may be calls for culling of wild birds to try to control or
limit the spread of H5N1. At this point, we don't know whether wild birds
are spreading H5N1 or are simply picking it up from outbreaks in domestic
poultry. Furthermore, it is recognized in the wildlife health community
that culling of wild birds is not an effective H5N1 control measure. The
most effective way to prevent transmission of avian influenza between
domestic poultry and wild birds is to improve biosecurity around poultry
farms. The key goal of improved biosecurity would be to reduce or prevent
contact between wild birds and domestic poultry and their wastes, whether
in backyard flocks or larger poultry producing facilities. Vaccination of
domestic poultry is another effective method to control avian influenza.
Why is this in the news?
---------
The current outbreak of H5N1 avian influenza in Southeast Asia has been
making news headlines for over a year now. Millions of domestic poultry
have been affected throughout Southeast Asia, and over 50 humans have died
to date. In the last 100 years, there have been 3 pandemics of avian
influenza in humans, the most lethal of which occurred in 1918-1919. Well
over 20 million people died in that outbreak. Many scientists and health
practitioners are warning that it is only a matter of time before the next
global influenza pandemic occurs.
The current strain circulating in Southeast Asia does not transmit
efficiently among humans. However, there is great worry that with continued
exposure to humans, the virus may evolve greater transmissibility through
mutation or by obtaining genetic material from human influenza viruses. The
discovery of H5N1 in migratory birds, thousands of kilometers away from the
known affected area, is worrying, as it suggests the disease is much more
widely spread than previously thought.
There are many rumors circulating about this issue, and given the
propensity of the media to speculation, it is important to keep in mind
what we know and what we don't know. What we know: Disease reports: in its
report to the Office International des Epizooties (an international body
responsible for fighting infectious diseases of domestic animals), China
reported that 519 individuals of 5 species (bar-headed goose, _Anser
indicus_; great black-headed gull, _Larus ichthyaetus_; brown-headed gull,
_Larus brunnicephalus_; ruddy shelduck _Tadorna ferruginea_; and great
cormorant, _Phalacrocorax carbo_) were found dead at Qinghai Lake Nature
Reserve. Although H5N1 avian influenza was initially ruled out as the cause
of death, it has subsequently been identified at the site. All these birds
are migratory, but not necessarily in Southeast Asia.
Control measures
---------
There are reports that China has closed all nature preserves to visitors,
including Qinghai NP. 3 million doses of vaccine have been shipped to the
province, presumably to vaccinate poultry in the area. Further, special
clinics have been set up to screen humans with fever or pneumonia for
influenza infection.
Critical information that we don't know
---------
We don't actually know what killed these birds. Apparently, as many as 100
000 birds congregate on this lake, and so 500 dead birds may not be
unusual, and it is possible that avian influenza was isolated from birds
that died of something else. Cause-of-death determinations may have been
done, but those data are not publicly available presently. If they were not
done, it may be too late to determine cause-of-death in this case, but such
determinations are a critical part of any disease outbreak.
We don't know how many of these 519 birds actually had avian influenza. In
some die-offs, detailed investigation is done on a few animals, and then
the results of those investigations are extrapolated to the rest of the
dead animals.
We don't know whether the virus isolated from these birds is related to the
virus circulating in Southeast Asia. The isolate should be sequenced and
the sequence deposited at GENBANK so that comparisons can be made.
We don't know how or where these birds got infected. H5N1 avian influenza
is known to be circulating in domestic poultry in Southeast Asia, but very
few wild birds have been found with the virus there. It is possible that
one of these 5 bird species (or one of the many other species that
congregate at Qinghai) brought the virus to the preserve from Southeast
Asia. Alternatively, it is also possible that there is an unreported
outbreak of H5N1 in domestic poultry in central China from which the wild
birds picked up the virus. Transparent reporting from China on the disease
status of their domestic poultry is necessary. Since domestic ducks can be
infected without showing signs, it is only fair to also note that local
authorities may not be aware of virus circulating in local flocks.
In a Chinese language news site where people can post articles, there are
unsubstantiated reports of 121 human deaths in 18 villages in Qinghai
Province due to an unknown cause. Some bloggers have speculated that these
are human cases of influenza, but at this point there, is no evidence for
or against this theory. The Chinese government is saying there are no human
cases. Again, transparent reporting is necessary.

[ProMED-mail regrets that the posting of these 2 reports has been delayed
inadvertently. They contain information that is still relevant to
evaluation of the current avian influenza situation in China. The 1st
reiterates that there have been no confirmed cases of transmission of avian
influenza to humans in China. The 2nd document contains a valuable
discussion of the interpretation of the data relating to the recovery of
avian influenza virus from wild birds in China and the questions that
remain unresolved. - Mod.CP]
