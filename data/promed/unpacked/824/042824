Outbreak of autochthonous malaria in Kazakhstan
-----------------------------------------------
Three local people suffering from malaria have been found in Southern
Kazakhstan Region, the senior doctor of the Region's health (and
epidemiological) centre, Berik Topgautov, has told an Interfax-Kazakhstan
correspondent. Topgautov noted that this was the first time that cases of
malarial infection had occurred in the Region over the past few years and
that it was not of "an imported nature".

[Malaria, primarily _P. vivax_ was endemic in the USSR until 1960 with
higher incidence in the Southern regions including Kazakhstan. Reemergence
of malaria transmission in the area is therefore possible and needs to be
taken very seriously. _P. vivax_ in the former USSR was of a particular
species, _P. vivax hibernans_, where a proportion of the infected people
incubated through the winter with a result of an early spring outbreak from
infections acquired the previous year. An outbreak in the area next spring
will definitely show the establishment of a new focus. We have without
success tried to get a comment from the WHO Regional Office for Europe. -
