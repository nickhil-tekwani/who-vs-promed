African swine fever (ASF) has hit Viet Nam's southern Tay Ninh province, Vietnam News Agency reported on [Sun 7 Jul 2019]

A herd of 16 pigs raised by a household in Tay Ninh's Chau Thanh district have been tested positive to ASF virus, and then culled to prevent the disease from spreading.

ASF has spread to almost all cities and provinces across Viet Nam, leading to the culling of over 2.84 million pigs or 10.3 percent of the country's total pig population.

Viet Nam will focus on developing cattle, poultry, and aquatic breeding to compensate for a shortage of pork which is expected to hit the country this year [2019] due to ASF, its Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development said late last month [June 2019].

Viet Nam reported the 1st ASF outbreak in February [2019] in northern Hung Yen province.

ASF is a severe viral disease affecting domestic pigs and boars which can be spread by live or dead pigs and pork products. The ASF virus is harmless to humans, but causes hemorrhagic fever in pigs and wild boars that is almost fatal.
