[The total number of monkeypox cases continues to increase each day. A 6 Jul 2022 report indicated that WHO will reconvene a meeting of the committee that will advise on declaring the outbreak a global health emergency, the WHO's highest level of alert, in the week beginning 18 Jul 2022 or sooner, Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a virtual news conference from Geneva (https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/who-more-than-6000-monkeypox-cases-reported-another-emergency-meeting-set-2022-07-06/).

[3] Wales, United Kingdom
Date: Tue 5 Jul 2022

https://www.deeside.com/public-health-officials-confirm-7-more-monkeypox-cases-in-wales/


Public Health Wales is today (4 Jul [2022]) confirming that 7 additional cases of monkeypox have been identified in Wales. This brings the total in Wales to 16.

The cases are being managed appropriately. To protect patient confidentiality, no further details relating to the patients will be disclosed.

The most recent cases are presenting predominantly in gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men. They have no travel links to a country where monkeypox is endemic, so it is possible they acquired the infection through community transmission.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
----------
Background. Monkeypox is transmitted by close contact with symptomatic cases, and those infected are assumed to be uniformly symptomatic. Evidence of subclinical monkeypox infection is limited to a few immunological studies which found evidence of immunity against orthopoxviruses in asymptomatic individuals who were exposed to monkeypox cases. We aimed to assess whether asymptomatic infections occurred among individuals who underwent sexually transmitted infection (STI) screening in a large Belgian STI clinic around the start of the 2022 monkeypox epidemic in Belgium.

Methods. Anorectal and oropharyngeal swabs collected for gonorrhoea/chlamydia screening from 1-31 May 2022 were retrospectively tested by a monkeypox-specific PCR. Cases with a positive PCR result were recalled to the clinic for case investigation, repeat testing, and contact tracing.

Findings. In stored samples from 224 men, we identified 3 cases with a positive anorectal monkeypox PCR. All 3 men denied having had any symptoms in the weeks before and after the sample was taken. None of them reported exposure to a diagnosed monkeypox case, nor did any of their contacts develop clinical monkeypox. Follow-up samples were taken 21-37 days after the initial sample, by which time the monkeypox-specific PCR was negative, likely as a consequence of spontaneous clearance of the infection.

Interpretation. The existence of asymptomatic monkeypox infection indicates that the virus might be transmitted to close contacts in the absence of symptoms. Our findings suggest that identification and isolation of symptomatic individuals may not suffice to contain the outbreak.

[Finding a small proportion of asymptomatic monkeypox (MPX) virus infections compared to symptomatic ones raises some significant questions. Is there virus in semen in the absence of skin lesions? Do asymptomatic cases have virus loads high enough for virus transmission to occur, and if so, for what period of time? As the authors suggest, identification and isolation of symptomatic individuals may not suffice to contain the outbreak. - Mod.TY

[5] Genome surveillance
Date: Sat 2 Jul 2022

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Within orthopoxviruses, a genetic core of about 120 000 base pairs is highly conserved and thought to code for basic viral functions; however, towards the termini the orthopoxvirus genome is plastic, and large regions can be readily deleted. These regions contain genes related to host adaption. Orthopoxviruses like variola virus that have adapted to a specific host species tend to lose many terminal host-restriction genes during adaptation, allowing them to spread more easily or cause more severe disease. This loss could optimise both the spread (e.g., by droplet-related transmission) via enhanced systemic infection and disease severity.

Circulating monkeypox virus might be undergoing adaption for the human host, so we must keep its genetic changes under tight surveillance so as to be prepared when sudden epidemiological changes [occur] and prevent the emergence of a variola virus epigone. This surveillance, however, will require a conceptual shift from observing lone single nucleotide polymorphisms, as with SARS-CoV-2 variants, toward watching closely for the integrity and stability of the monkeypox virus genomic termini. Therefore, the constant sequencing of full monkeypox virus genomes is of utmost importance to detect not only single nucleotide polymorphisms but any intragenic frameshifts or premature stop codons, that might indicate initial signals of gene loss. This surveillance, however, requires the highest-quality genomic data and careful annotation. Currently many sequences from the ongoing outbreak are erroneous or do not have annotation, which makes it difficult to establish useful genomic characterisation.

[The authors make a compelling case for the need for high-quality surveillance of the entire monkeypox virus genome. This will require an integrated system for collection of samples and laboratory support for genome sequencing and interpretation. Are national health authorities able and willing to do this? Perhaps the WHO could coordinate this effort. - Mod.TY]
