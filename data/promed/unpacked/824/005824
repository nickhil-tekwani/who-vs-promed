There was another patient at Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (PIMS) on 17 May 2015 who later on expired on 21 May 2015.

Mansehra, Abbottabad and other parts of KPK are endemic for the disease. Previously, many cases have been reported with the death of a doctor; a physician resident of Mansehra, who got infected during treatment of a positive patient at Ayub Medical Complex Abbottabad.

A 45 year old man from the village Beyali, Mansehra, an animal trader, became ill with fever and loose motions [bowels?] on 8 May 2015. He was treated by local doctors in the village. On 14 May [2015], he was in a serious condition with bleeding from his nose and gums and was shifted to the district headquarters hospital Mansehra, then to Ayub teaching hospital Abbottabad, where he was admitted to a medical ward. On the same day, he was shifted to the combined military hospital Abbottabad. On 17 May 2015, he was shifted to the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences Islamabad for further treatment, where he was kept in ICU. A sample for Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever [CCHF] serology was sent on [20?] May 2015. He expired on 21 May 2015. In all above treatment sites, he was dealt with without infection control practices [ICP] being observed. The case was declared CCHF positive by the National Institute of Health on 24 May 2015.

There is immense need to enhance the capacity of doctors to identify cases at initial stages to avoid unnecessary exposure of other health staff and persons. Capacity building workshops must be arranged to refresh the knowledge of doctors at all levels to avoid nosocomial spread, especially in endemic areas. Every time, when such cases present to any doctor, initially they are treated without observing any IPC precautions, which is a great risk for infection transmission, especially in hospital settings.

[ProMED-mail welcomes reports from the field like this one.

The circumstances under which the patient acquired his CCHF virus infection imply transmission of CCHF virus via tick bite or via exposure to the blood of an infected animal. The above warning to attending physicians should be heeded. The dilemma is that the symptoms very early in the course of CCHF disease are similar to those caused by many other pathogens. Workshops would be helpful.

The virus can cause severe viral hemorrhagic fever outbreaks, with a case fatality rate of 10-40 per cent. The virus is transmitted by _Hyalomma_ spp ticks or through contact with infected human blood or animal blood and tissues during and immediately after slaughter. The majority of cases have occurred in people involved in the livestock industry, such as agricultural workers, slaughterhouse workers, and veterinarians. Exposure in health care facilities can also occur, which is why there is concern for the health care workers who are in contact with patients.

The length of the incubation period depends on the mode of acquisition of the virus. Following infection by a tick bite, the incubation period is usually 1-3 days, with a maximum of 9 days.

CCHF virus is a tickborne virus in the genus _Nairovirus_, family _Bunyaviridae_.
