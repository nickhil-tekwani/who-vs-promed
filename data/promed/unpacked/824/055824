[Since there have now been reported cases of MERS-CoV infection from 22 countries, we have decided to change the name of the thread to reflect the multi country distribution, including areas outside of the Eastern Mediterranean region, even though all cases to date can be linked to an index case with contact in the Eastern Mediterranean. - Mod.MPP]

[1] Bangladesh ex USA via UAE, 1st case - media report, 15 Jun 2014, RFI
Date: Sun 15 Jun 2014

Bangladesh Sunday [15 Jun 2014] reported its 1st case of the deadly MERS [Middle East respiratory syndrome] virus after a Bangladesh-born US resident was admitted to hospital days after returning to his homeland via Abu Dhabi.

The condition of the unidentified 53-year-old man had improved but he was still in intensive care in a Dhaka clinic, Mahmudur Rahman, the director of the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research, told AFP.

"He is Bangladesh-born but lives in the US. He came to the country on [4 Jun 2014] and became sick 2 days later. Most probably he contracted the virus during the 3 hours at Abu Dhabi airport or in the plane," he said.

"After a series of tests we got confirmation yesterday [14 Jun 2014] that he was suffering from MERS coronavirus."

It was the 1st known MERS case in Bangladesh. The country has become the 22nd nation to report a case of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), according to Rahman.

Other countries including Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Iran, the Netherlands, the United Arab Emirates, the United States, and Algeria have also recorded cases, mostly in people who had been to Saudi Arabia.

MERS has killed 284 people in Saudi Arabia since it first emerged in 2012, and hundreds more have been infected [see below for latest data from Saudi Arabia].

It is considered a deadlier but less transmissible cousin of the severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS] virus that appeared in Asia in 2003 and killed hundreds of people, mostly in China.

Like SARS, it appears to cause a lung infection, with patients suffering coughing, breathing difficulties, and [fever]. But MERS differs in that it also causes rapid kidney failure.

Muslim pilgrims from around the world are pouring into the holy city of Mecca in Saudi Arabia, undeterred by the spread of the deadly virus.

Research has suggested that the virus has been common in camels for at least 20 years.

Last week, researchers said they had found the 1st direct evidence that MERS jumps directly from camels to humans.

Rahman said it was only a matter of time before MERS arrived in Bangladesh. Some 3 million Bangladeshis work in the Middle East, more than 2/3 of them in Saudi Arabia.

[This is the 1st reported case of MERS-CoV infection from Bangladesh. The history of the patient travelling through Abu Dhabi with a 3 hour connect is curious to say the least, suggesting that exposure may have occurred while in the airport. More significant might be a look back at individuals travelling on the flight to or from Abu Dhabi to see if there were individuals with evidence of a respiratory infection seated near to this case on the plane -- a significant challenge. The other alternative is that the individual was exposed while in the USA -- less likely as there haven't been reports of MERS-CoV infections other than the 2 individuals returning to the USA from Saudi Arabia. If this individual is confirmed to be MERS-CoV infected by a reference laboratory, the exposure and route of transmission appears to be somewhat of an enigma, suggesting a more casual contact with a MERS-CoV infected individual than previously felt to be necessary for transmission.

In another media report submitted by ProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall, there was mention that Bangladesh has tested 39 suspected cases of MERS-CoV infection prior to this confirmation (see http://bdnews24.com/health/2014/06/15/first-case-of-mers-in-bangladesh). In addition, apparently a 2nd specimen from this case has been processed. More information on potential high risk exposures of this patient would be greatly appreciated.

[In the past 5 days (12-16 Jun 2014) there have been 3 newly confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection and 2 deaths reported in Saudi Arabia. Cases have occurred in Albaha, Qunfutha, and Riyadh, whereas deaths occurred in Riyadh and Dahran. Of note is a glimpse of other geographic areas involved with confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection -- Albaha, Khobar, Qunfutha, and Dahran -- possibly locations where cases were retrospectively confirmed through the review of data earlier this month (June 2014). (see the WHO reports below for more details on some of these cases).

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) -- update 14 Jun 2014
----------------------------------------------------------------------
On 31 May 2014, the National IHR Focal Point of Algeria notified WHO of 2 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with Middle East Respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). This is the 1st report of laboratory confirmed cases in Algeria.

Details of the 2 cases
----------------------
- A 66 year old man who was part of a pilgrimage group that went to Saudi Arabia to perform Umrah [pilgrimage to Mecca] on 14 May 2014. The patient became ill on 23 May 2014, while in Saudi Arabia. Upon his arrival to Algeria on 28 May 2014, he was hospitalized. The patient has underlying medical conditions.
- A 59 year old man who went on a pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia on 5 May 2014. The patient became ill on 23 May 2014, while in Saudi Arabia. On 29 May 2014, he was hospitalized. He did not have any underlying medical condition. Despite all medical care, the patient died on 10 Jun 2014 from multi organ failure.

Since June 2013, the Ministry of Health, Population and Hospital Reform (MSPRH) has enhanced activities for the early detection and monitoring of MERS-CoV. MSPRH was alerted by the Prefecture Health Services of Tipaza and Tlemcen of the 2 suspected cases of MERS-CoV on 29 May 2014. On 30 May 2014, laboratory confirmation was established for both cases by the Institut Pasteur in Algeria.

Medical and preventive measures have been implemented in accordance with the instructions issued by MSPRH, which include:
- Meetings of the crisis committee.
- Points of entry have been informed to heighten surveillance and inform passengers travelling to pilgrim areas. Information products have been developed and are distributed to passengers. A special area has been assigned to facilitate interaction with passengers, the distribution of leaflets with public health recommendations, as well as the distribution of disinfectant and masks.
- Investigation teams are following up on confirmed and suspected MERS-CoV cases based on national directives for surveillance and alert.
- Information campaigns are ongoing, using different channels of information including the media.

Globally, 699 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV including at least 210 related deaths have officially been reported to WHO.

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) -- update 13 Jun 2014
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The National IHR Focal Points of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and the Islamic Republic of Iran recently reported additional laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) to WHO.

Details of the cases reported by Saudi Arabia
---------------------------------------------
Between [11 Apr 2014 and 9 Jun 2014], 515 cases of infection with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have been reported from Saudi Arabia to WHO. This includes 402 laboratory-confirmed cases reported on various dates, and 113 cases that have been identified through retrospective review of hospital records, and which was reported by Saudi Arabia on [3 Jun 2014]. Further information on these cases will be provided as information becomes available as part of the collaboration between the Saudi authorities and WHO on the MERS-CoV response.

This update covers 402 laboratory-confirmed cases, including 114 deaths.

35 cases were reported from Madina, 132 from Riyadh, 208 from Mecca Province (including 154 from Jeddah, 39 from Mecca, 8 from Qunfudhah, and 7 from Al Taif), 10 from Tabuk, 6 from Al Jawf, 3 from Najran, and 3 from Ash Sharqiyah. The location of reported 5 cases was not specified.

The median age of the 402 cases is 46 years old (ranging from 9 months to 94 years old) and 58.3 percent of those with information on sex (n=388) are men. Almost half (44.5 percent) of the cases with reported information (n=398) experienced severe disease including 114 cases who died; and 114 cases (28.6 percent) were reported to be asymptomatic or have mild disease. Underlying medical conditions were only reported for 149 of the 402 cases [37.1 percent], of which 140 cases were reported to have at least one underlying medical condition.

More than 25 percent (109) of the 402 reported cases are health care workers. Among the 109 health care workers, 63 [57.8 percent] were reported as asymptomatic or developing mild symptoms, 35 [32.1 percent] were reported with moderate symptoms (requiring hospitalization but not admission to an intensive care unit), 7 [6.4 percent] were reported as having severe disease and 4 [3.7 percent] died.

Details of the case reported by the UAE on [4 Jun 2014]
-------------------------------------------------------
The patient is a 36 year old butcher residing in Abu Dhabi. He works in a local slaughterhouse for camels and sheep. He was asymptomatic. His sputum was tested positive for MERS-CoV on 20 May 2014 as part of a general screening in slaughterhouses. The patient had no contact with a previously laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV case. He had no history of travel. The patient is currently isolated and is in stable condition.

Investigations and follow up of contacts of the patient have been carried out and no other case was detected.

Details of the case reported by the Islamic Republic of Iran on [4 Jun 2014]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The patient is a 35 year old nurse assistant. She developed a mild illness on 26 May 2014 followed by a productive cough on 28 May 2014. Her throat swab taken on 26 May 2014 was tested positive for MERS-CoV.

She has been advised to stay home and follow infection control precautions. The patient is a close contact to the 1st laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV case in the country reported to WHO on 26 May 2014. The patient did not have an underlying medical condition. She had no history of contact with animals and no history of consumption of raw camel products in the 14 days prior to becoming ill. She became asymptomatic on [3 Jun 2014] and her condition is currently stable.

Investigations into her contacts among health care workers and family members is ongoing.

Globally, 697 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV including at least 210 related deaths have officially been reported to WHO. This global total includes all the cases in this update; of the above-mentioned 402 cases reported by Saudi Arabia, 390 cases have been included in previous Disease Outbreak News (DON) updates published since [14 Apr 2014].

[The WHO update of 13 Jun 2014 provides a summary of information on the retrospectively confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection in Saudi Arabia. Points of interest include the geographic extent of the cases (35 from Madina, 132 from Riyadh, 208 from Mecca Province (including 154 from Jeddah, 39 from Mecca, 8 from Qunfudhah, and 7 from Al Taif), 10 from Tabuk, 6 from Al Jawf, 3 from Najran, and 3 from Ash Sharqiyah) and the fact that more than 25 percent of the cases occurred in healthcare workers.

What is difficult to reconcile are the numbers, and which cases have been reported by Saudi Arabia and were not confirmed by WHO, and reasons for non-confirmation. The most recent WHO update above (section [3]) mentions that globally there have been 701 laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection including 239 deaths -- as of today, 16 Jun 2014, the Saudi MOH website states there have been 703 cases of MERS-CoV infection in Saudi Arabia including 289 deaths.

The case confirmed in the UAE is the 1st report of a butcher working in a slaughterhouse for camels and sheep. This case was asymptomatic and was detected through screening of high risk exposure individuals.

In Iran, the newly reported case is in a healthcare worker with known close contact with the 1st confirmed case of MERS-CoV infection in Iran.
