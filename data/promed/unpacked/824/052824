Outbreak of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in Croatia
------------------------------------------------------------
An extensive outbreak of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is
occurring in Croatia this year. From the beginning of March 2002, more than
60 cases, including one death, have been diagnosed. Cases have been
reported from almost all of Croatia, except the Adriatic coast and islands.
Stringent epidemiological measures have been recommended in order to limit
the outbreak.
Several new HFRS foci have been reported. Two laboratories are involved in
the diagnosis of HFRS. One is at the Institute of Immunology, Zagreb, where
enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is used to detect Puumala virus
and Dobrava-Belgrade virus infections (supported with reagents provided by
Professor Tatjana Avsic Zupanc of the WHO Collaborating Centre for
Arbovirus and Hemorrhagic Fever Reference and the Research Institute of
Microbiology and Immunology Medical Faculty, Ljubljana, Slovenia). The
other is at the Virology Department of the Croatian Institute of Public
Health, where [hantavirus] group-antigen and a commercial immunofluorescent
antibody (IFA) test are used.
Initial serological results suggest that most of the patients this year
have had Puumala virus infections; additional tests for confirmation are
under way. Although some severe cases have been recorded, most have had
mild or moderate clinical pictures.
HFRS was first recognized in Croatia in 1952 (Radosevic Z, Mohacek I. Acta
Med Scand 1954; 149: 221-8). In the spring of 1967, a cluster of 14 cases
of HFRS occurred in the Plitvice Lakes [National Park] area
(Vesenjak-Hirjan J, Borcic B. Lijec Vjesn 1986; 108: 197-9). In 1989, there
was an outbreak of 14 cases of HFRS in soldiers near Velika Gorica (Anon.
1993), and in 1991 an outbreak occurred in Novska County, a newly
recognized HFRS-endemic area (Borcic B, et al. Croatian Med J 1996; 37:
115-8). In 1995, we recorded the largest HFRS epidemic in Croatia to date
(over 120 patients; Markotic A, et al. Nature Med 1996; 2: 269-70; Kuzman
I, et al. Lijec Vjesn 1997; 119: 311-5; Markotic A, et al. J Med Virol
2002; 66: 542-1).
The rodent _Addionomys glareolus_ is the principle vertebrate reservoir of
hantaviruses in Croatia, with _Apodemus flavicollis_, _Apodemus agrarius_,
and _Apodemus sylvaticus_ playing lesser roles (Petricevic I, et al. Lijec
Vjesn 1989; 111: 67-71; Borcic B, et al. Lijec Vjesn 1991; 113: 320-3). New
and interesting rodent data have been reported by Ledina et al (Croatian
Med J 2002, in press) in a new natural focus, Dinara Mountain, discovered
in 1995 (Kuzman I, et al. Lijec Vjesn 1997).
Croatia borders Slovenia to the northwest and has an extended border with
Bosnia-Herzegovina, one of the most significant HFRS endemic areas in
Europe (Markotic A, et al. Nature Med 1996; 2:269-70). Both Puumala virus
and Dobrava-Belgrade virus have been found to cause HFRS in Slovenia and in
Bosnia-Herzegovina (Avsic-Zupanc, et al. J Med Virol 1992; 38: 132-7;
Lundkvist A, et al. J Med Virol 1997; 53: 51-9). Recently, it was confirmed
that Puumala virus and Dobrava-Belgrade virus also cause HFRS in Croatia
(Markotic A, et al. J Med Virol 2002; 66: 542-51).
On 17 May 2002 the Institute of Immunology, Zagreb, held an ad hoc
mini-symposium about the current HFRS outbreak in Croatia. The current
outbreak has arrived 7 years after the largest recorded HFRS outbreak in
Croatia, The 1995 outbreak, which occurred during the [Balkans] war,
ceased in June, when it was expected to reach a peak. We believe that
public education and strict control measures contributed significantly to
this epidemic cessation and we are making concerted efforts to control the
outbreak using the same measures.

[This report on the current and previous outbreaks of HFRS in Croatia
provided by Dr Markotic should be read in conjunction with the reports of
the current hantavirus outbreak in Slovenia, referenced below. The data
from both countries confirm that Puumala virus is the predominant
etiological agent responsible for HFRS in this region of south eastern
Europe at the present time. A major difference may be that the rodent
_Addionomys glareolus_ appears to be the principal vertebrate reservoir of
hantaviruses in Croatia, rather than _Apodemus flavicollis_ as in Slovenia.
