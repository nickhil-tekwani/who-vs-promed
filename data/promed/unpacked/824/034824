On 12 Jan 2010, a 7.0 magnitude earthquake struck Haiti, which
borders the Dominican Republic on the island of Hispaniola. The
earthquake's epicenter was 10 miles west of the Haiti capital city of
Port-au-Prince (estimated population: 2 million). According to the
Haitian government, approximately 200 000 persons were killed, and
500 000 were left homeless (1).

Malaria caused by _Plasmodium falciparum_ infection is endemic in
Haiti, and the principal mosquito vector is _Anopheles albimanus_,
which frequently bites outdoors. Thus, displaced persons living
outdoors or in temporary shelters and thousands of emergency
responders in Haiti are at substantial risk for malaria. During 12
Jan-25 Feb 2010, CDC received reports of 11 laboratory-confirmed
cases of _P. falciparum_ malaria acquired in Haiti. Patients included
7 U.S. residents who were emergency responders, 3 Haitian residents,
and one U.S. traveler. This report summarizes the 11 cases and
provides chemoprophylactic and additional preventive recommendations
to minimize the risk for acquiring malaria for persons traveling to Haiti.

Of the 7 emergency responders, 6 were U.S. military personnel. Among
the 6, 4 cases were uncomplicated and treated locally in Haiti. Two
other patients were moderately to seriously ill and transferred to
the United States for intensive care; one required intubation and
mechanical ventilation for acute respiratory distress syndrome. All
are expected to make a full recovery.

All 6 military personnel had been provided oral chemoprophylaxis with
doxycycline before departure from the United States and personal
protective equipment (e.g., insect repellent and insecticide-treated
netting and uniforms) after arrival in Haiti. Of the 11 total
patients, chemoprophylaxis was indicated for the 7 emergency
responders and the lone U.S. traveler. Six of these 8 patients
(including the 2 hospitalized military personnel) reported
non-adherence to the recommended malaria medication regimen.
Adherence status was unknown for the remaining 2 patients.

Three cases occurred in Haitian residents who traveled to the United
States, including one Haitian adoptee. The number of U.S. malaria
cases imported from Haiti likely is underestimated because,
typically, not all cases are reported to CDC.

MMWR Editorial Note
-----------
Information regarding the incidence of malaria in Haiti is limited.
Historically, malaria transmission peaks in Haiti after the 2 rainy
seasons, with a primary peak during November-January and a secondary
peak during May-June.

Although each year Haiti reports approximately 30 000 confirmed cases
of malaria to the Pan American Health Organization, as many as 200
000 cases might occur annually. One population-based survey in 2006
in the Artibonite Valley, located 75 miles north of Port-au-Prince,
found an overall prevalence of _P. falciparum_ infection of 3.1
percent (14.2 percent in febrile and 2.1 percent in nonfebrile persons) (4).

Prompt diagnosis and treatment of malaria as well as chemoprophylaxis
when appropriate are critical. Recommendations for antimalarials for
treatment and prevention are based on information on parasite drug
susceptibility for a specific geographic setting.

In Haiti, the 1st-line treatment for malaria is chloroquine. No
evidence exists of clinical failure of chloroquine treatment in
persons with _P. falciparum_ infection acquired in Hispaniola, nor
has chloroquine prophylaxis failure been documented in travelers.

However, one published study found 5 of 79 (6.3 percent) _P.
falciparum_ isolates collected in the Artibonite Valley in Haiti in
2006 and 2007 carried a mutation associated with parasite resistance
to chloroquine (5). Although the findings do not serve as a basis for
prophylaxis and treatment policy change, they do point out the need
for heightened awareness of potential failure of chloroquine
treatment or prophylaxis in persons in Haiti or returning from Haiti.

Persons traveling to Haiti should receive chemoprophylaxis with one
of the following medications: atovaquone-proguanil, chloroquine,
doxycycline, or mefloquine (6). If preventive medications are started
less than one week before departure, or while already in Haiti,
either atovaquone-proguanil or doxycycline are recommended. Use of
weekly chloroquine requires receiving the initial dose one week
before departure, and use of weekly mefloquine requires receiving the
initial dose 2 weeks before departure. Mosquito avoidance measures
should be taken, such as using mosquito repellent, wearing protective
clothing, and sleeping under an insecticide-treated mosquito net.

Chemoprophylaxis, although highly effective in preventing malaria, is
not 100 percent effective. Therefore, if fever develops in persons
taking chloroquine or other antimalarials for chemoprophylaxis, they
still should be evaluated for malaria infection with a diagnostic test.

CDC currently recommends microscopic examination of blood smears for
malaria diagnosis.

Three negative malaria smears spaced 12-24 hours apart are needed to
rule out malaria.

However, microscopy capacity in Haiti is limited at this time. A
diagnostic option frequently used in emergency settings in areas with
high prevalence of malaria is a rapid diagnostic test based on
antigen detection. However, if laboratory diagnosis of malaria is not
possible, presumptive treatment based on clinical suspicion of
malaria (e.g., unexplained fever) should be given. Rapid diagnostic
tests for malaria can remain positive up to 3 weeks after treatment
and should not be used to assess treatment failure in a patient with malaria.

Persons with laboratory-confirmed _P. falciparum_ malaria acquired in
Haiti and treated in the United States and emergency responders
treated in the field should receive treatment according to CDC
guidelines (7). Uncomplicated malaria can be treated with one of the
following regimens: chloroquine, artemether-lumefantrine,
atovaquone-proguanil, or the combination of quinine and doxycycline,
tetracycline, or clindamycin.

In patients with confirmed malaria who report adherence to
chemoprophylaxis in Haiti, a change to a different drug than that
taken for chemoprophylaxis is recommended for treatment. Clinicians
should consider switching patients with uncomplicated,
laboratory-confirmed malaria from chloroquine treatment to other
recommended drugs after any indication of poor response to
chloroquine such as increasing parasite density 24 hours after
starting treatment, persistent parasitemia 48 hours after starting
treatment, or clinical deterioration.

Severe malaria requires treatment with intravenous quinidine and one
of the following: doxycycline, tetracycline, or clindamycin.
Intravenous artesunate also is available from CDC for use in the
United States as part of an investigational drug protocol. If
treating severe malaria in a responder in the field, treatment should
be initiated with available medications and consideration given to
immediate medical evacuation.

In Haiti, residents with malaria should be treated in accordance with
that country's national treatment guidelines. 1st-line treatment for
uncomplicated malaria in Haiti is chloroquine. 1st-line treatment for
severe malaria in Haiti is intravenous or intramuscular quinine.

CDC continues to monitor the malaria situation in Haiti, including
any reports of possible chloroquine prophylaxis or treatment failures
in those returning from Haiti. Medical providers should contact the
CDC Malaria Branch clinician on call (770-488-7100) for clinical
consultations and to discuss cases of apparent chloroquine treatment
or prophylaxis failures and testing of parasites at CDC for
resistance markers. Additional information on malaria is available at
