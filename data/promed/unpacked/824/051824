KCC Braces for Cholera
--------------------------
Kampala city health authorities are bracing for a possible cholera epidemic
following reported deaths and hospital cases recently. The city director
of health services, Dr. Mesak Mubiru, on 15 Apr 2004, said 2 people aged 28
and 50, of Kanyogoga Zone, Namuwongo in Makindye Division, died of
diarrhea-related illness.
Mubiru said 5 people had been treated in Mulago Hospital for diarrhea and
vomiting. He, however, said it was too early to conclude that the disease
was cholera, saying they were still conducting tests at the Central
Laboratory Services, Wandegeya.
The Makindye Division health inspector, Joseph Tirango said the area had
poor sanitation and that it lacked safe drinking water. "These people do
not have toilets. They dispose of the feces anywhere. The sanitation is
very poor," he said. He said there was only 1 KCC-owned communal latrine,
accessed at a fee.
The division senior assistant town clerk Grace Tabuzibwa said they had
requested KCC to allow residents use the latrine for free. Tabuzibwa said
they were intensifying public health education programs to combat any
possible cholera outbreak.

Somalia: Cholera On the Rise in Mogadishu
----------------------------------------------
The number of suspected cholera cases has increased in the Somali capital,
Mogadishu, since the beginning of Apr 2004, according to a World Health
Organisation (WHO) medical officer.
Speaking by telephone from Mogadishu, Muhammad Fuje said between 3 Apr and
9 Apr 2004, 489 diarrheal cases had been diagnosed in 3 of the city's
hospitals, of whom 9 patients had died.
Tests had been done this week on 20 stool samples from patients in the 3
hospitals, which confirmed that 12 patients had cholera, he said. "In a
situation like this, it is up to the Ministry of Health to declare whether
there is a cholera outbreak."
Since mid-Dec 2003, 2042 cases of suspected cholera had been reported to
WHO, including 23 deaths, Fuje told IRIN.
Between 27 Mar and 2 Apr 2004, 173 suspected cases were recorded, up from
between 40 and 50 in the previous 2 weeks. "It is very alarming, because
the number of diarrheal cases is on the rise in the sentinel sites," he said.
Fuje added that now was "the cholera season" in Somalia, resulting from the
hot weather, coupled with increased rains and water consumption. "The most
important thing now is to stabilise it and increase public awareness about
hygiene," he said, as well as supporting cholera treatment centers.
Since 1994, outbreaks of cholera cases have been recorded annually in
Mogadishu and many other parts of Somalia. The illness was endemic to
Mogadishu, Fuje told IRIN, due to the absence of basic sanitation and a
centralized water supply system. "Every house has its own well, often near
toilets, so contamination is common," he said.

Cholera Claims More Lives And Spreads Further
--------------------------------------------------
The current Mozambican cholera epidemic has claimed 3 more lives in Maputo
and Sofala provinces this week, and has spread to the district of Mocuba,
in Zambezia province, although no death from the disease has been notified
here, reports the Fri, 16 Apr 2004 issue of the Maputo daily "Noticias".
2 of the deaths occurred in Sofala, and the other was reported in Maputo.
In Mocuba, 14 cases of cholera have been diagnosed in the past week.
Also in Zambezia, on Thu, 15 Apr 2004, 7 patients were hospitalized with
cholera in the district of Namacurra, 6 in the provincial capital,
Quelimane, and one in Nicoadala. This brings to 1016 the total number of
cases in Zambezia since late Jan 2004, when the 1st case was diagnosed.
However, only 10 of these patients have died.
With the latest fatality in Maputo, the death toll in the Mozambican
capital has now reached 38 since the outbreak began in Dec 2004. The death
toll in Sofala now stands at 27.
Maputo is by far the worst-hit part of the country -- but the epidemic is
clearly waning, since there are now only between 50 and 70 new cases a day
being reported, compared with about 350 patients a day at the peak of the
epidemic, in Jan 2004.
There were 119 hospitalized patients at the Cholera Treatment Center (CTC)
at Maputo's Mavalane General Hospital on Thu 15 Apr 2004, including the 63
admitted that day.
Maputo city Health director Olivia Ferreira told reporters that, though
this may be described as an improvement, the health authorities are
insisting on maintaining preventive measures, and are still on full alert.
"We are recording a certain drop in terms of cholera in Maputo city, but we
also record some increases on rainy days, particularly in the suburbs with
the worst sanitation conditions. We must note, however, that both new
admissions and the number of hospitalized patients has been dropping", she
said.
In Sofala, the chief doctor for the province, Flavio Wate, said that the
situation is gradually coming under control, and the number of new cases is
dropping by the day.
Sofala had 70 hospitalized cholera patients on Thu 15 Apr 2004, of whom the
great majority (51) were in the provincial capital, Beira.

Health authorities in Vilankulo district in southern Mozambique said on
Mon, 12 Apr 2004 that they have confirmed at least 22 cholera cases in the
past week.
It is the first time the outbreak that began in Dec 2003 has been detected
in Vilankulo, 400 km northeast of Maputo, the capital. In the rest of the
country, more than 100 people have died and thousands have been sickened by
the outbreak.
A report on state radio said laboratory analysis by the Inhambane
provincial hospital confirmed the cases in Vilankulo after complaints
emerged in recent days of cholera symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting.
The World Health Organisation, the Mozambican health ministry and others
have vaccinated thousands of people since the outbreak began. 2 doses of
the oral vaccine, given in successive weeks, protect patients for at least
a year.
New cases continue to be reported in Maputo, and other areas, though the
numbers are smaller than in previous months during the height of the outbreak.
In Maputo, health authorities say about 70 more people a day are seeking
help, down from a height of 350 new patients daily.
"We have been recording relatively small numbers of patients at the wards,
and that puts us more at ease, although it also means that more work should
be done to bring these figures even lower," said Olivia Ferreira, the
Maputo city health director.

CBoH Arrests Bweengwa Diarrhea Outbreak
-------------------------------------------------
The Central Board of Health (CBoH) says a diarrhea outbreak in Bweengwa
constituency southern province that claimed 6 lives has been brought under
control.
CBoH spokesperson Dr Victor Mukonka said in an interview in Lusaka
yesterday that investigations had shown that the outbreak was just an
ordinary diarrhea and not cholera as earlier suspected. He said the
remaining 12 patients who were admitted at the health center had all been
discharged.
6 villagers last week [1st week of April 2004] died in Monze after drinking
contaminated water, while 12 others were admitted at Bweengwa rural health
center the villagers complained of diarrhea and vomiting.
UPND Bweengwa member of Parliament (MP) Japhet Moonde alleged that the
water was contaminated as a result of the poor sanitary conditions caused
by the rains.

Dysentery hits Madura, 17 treated
-----------------------------------
Following a dengue outbreak, a dysentery outbreak has hit Bangkalan
district in Madura island. At least 17 people, mostly children, were
treated at Bangkalan General Hospital on Mon, 12 Apr 2004.
The 17 people, 13 of them children, were suffering from dehydration and
their condition was very weak.
Director of Bangkalan General Hospital, Dr. Heru Ariyadi, confirmed that
some areas in Bangkalan were affected, but it was too early to declare an
emergency in the area. "The condition is still not alarming yet, but the
spread of dysentery must be controlled," he said.
He explained that the increase in the cases of dysentery on the island was
largely attributed to the change in seasons, from wet to dry. The weather
reduced the amount and quality of fresh water in the area.
He urged local residents to only drink boiled water and if they had
diarrhea to immediately consume rehydration salts or drink warm lime juice,
with a little salt added.
"Diarrhea sufferers must be given fluids to prevent dehydration," he said.

Dysentery Claims 5 Lives in Gorakhpur, India
-------------------------------------------------
At least 5 children have died in the last 2 days in Gorakhpur, India, as
hospitals reported an alarming rise in dysentery cases. Dozens more are
seriously ill and hospitals are overflowing with more and more children
being brought in everyday.
A common ailment, the disease has taken on serious proportions as a severe
heat wave has led to water shortage, forcing villagers to draw water from
untreated sources like rivulets. Worried parents have traveled hundreds of
kilometers to Gorakhpur to get their children treated.
"The epidemic started 3-4 days back and we expect more patients. If primary
aid is given to them then they can be saved. 5 children have expired. Daily
10-15 children are being admitted in the OPD (Out Patients Department),"
R.K Gupta, junior doctor at the city's main medical college, said. State
authorities say all efforts are being taken to prevent the epidemic from
spreading.

Diarrhea in 34 Sailkupa Villages, Bangladesh
---------------------------------------------
2 persons died of diarrhea in Sailkupa upazila in Jhenidah district in the
last 2 days. At least 5000 people have been affected by the disease, Civil
Surgeon Dr Nazrul Islam told newsmen after a visit to the affected areas.
The dead were aged 4 and 85 years. Both died on Mon, 12 Apr 2004.
The disease has spread to 34 villages in 5 Unions in the upazila, district
health officials said. The civil surgeon said the situation is under
control now after 9 medical teams started working in the area. 3 camps have
been opened.
About 100 patients have been admitted to upazila health complexes at
Sailkupa and Sripur (Magura). The disease spread quickly as those attacked
remained at home instead of going to hospitals for treatment, the civil
surgeon said.
But Abdul Bari, chairman of Dhalaharchandra Union Parishad in the affected
area (when contacted over the phone) said the disease is spreading and more
people are being attacked.
He said besides medicine, food should be supplied in the area as relief, as
many people are starving because their bread-earning male members have been
disabled by the disease.
During a visit to Sailkupa health complex yesterday, some patients told
this correspondent that they were not getting adequate medicine. "A doctor
gave me a slip to bring medicine from outside, but pharmacists told me this
medicine is available only at government hospitals", an affected patient said.
