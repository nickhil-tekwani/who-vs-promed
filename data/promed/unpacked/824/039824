Swedish media reported today a suspected case of nvCJD in Poland. The
possible victim is a 20-year-old female student from Posnan that recently
died of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
The young woman didn't eat much meat, according to her parents. However,
as a child she often had beef.
Polish authorities will further investigate the case.

[There is not much specific information in this report to support the
supposition of nvCJD, but the student's age is consistent with this
provisional diagnosis. If anyone has more detailed diagnostic information
please forward to promed@usa.healthnet.org. - Mod.ES
