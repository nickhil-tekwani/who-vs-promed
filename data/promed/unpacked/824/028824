[A 20 Jul 2020 report notes that "the ongoing monkeypox outbreak in non-endemic countries is likely to be a consequence of the failure to curtail the spread of the disease in endemic regions of Africa despite decades of constant outbreaks. A globally driven One Health approach to prevention and treatment of the disease is essential to control present and future outbreaks."

A Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) administrator and a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) director of HIV prevention now serve as the heads of the federal monkeypox response team, according to an announcement made today by the Biden administration. Robert Fenton, Jr, the current FEMA regional administrator for the American West, will be the response coordinator, and Demetre Daskalakis of CDC will serve as the deputy coordinator. The White House said the team will coordinate efforts between the federal government and state and local authorities, including managing adequate supplies for testing, treating, and vaccinating. (https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2022/08/white-house-names-new-monkeypox-response-team).

The Red Cross is taking measures to avoid taking blood from monkeypox infected individuals. In addition to temperature checks that are part of standard health screens for prospective donors, the American Red Cross is now checking for the distinctive lesions that are a hallmark of the disease as part of routine arm examinations. And beginning in October, the Red Cross will require individuals who have been diagnosed with monkeypox or exposed to someone with a monkeypox infection to wait at least 21 days before giving blood.

[A] India (Kerala): death, ex United Arab Emirates
Date: Sun 31 Jul 2022
Source: Nokia News [edited]
https://www.nokiamobilephonenews.co.uk/news/kerala-requests-a-high-level-inquiry-after-a-man-who-had-symptoms-similar-to-monkey-pox-dies/


Veena George, Kerala's minister of health, launched a high-level investigation into the death of a young man with symptoms similar to monkeypox. "Test results from a foreign country were positive. Monkeypox is not a fatal disease," said Kerala's health minister. "He sought treatment in Thrissur due to severe fatigue and encephalitis."

The young man was from Chavakkad Kuranjiyur in the district of Thrissur. The delay in seeking treatment, Veena George said, will be looked into. The health department convened a meeting in Punnayur. In the interim, a contact list and travel itinerary for the deceased youth have been created. The isolation of contact people has been recommended.

India has so far reported 5 cases of monkeypox, with 3 cases coming from Kerala, one from Delhi, and one from Guntur in Andhra Pradesh. In the wake of this, the central government is on high alert due to an increase in infection rates in some other nations.

In an interview with ANI, Dr VK Paul, member of NITI Aayog [National Institution for Transforming India -- policy think tank of the Government of India] responsible for health, stated that there was no need for excessive panic but added that it was still crucial for the nation and society to remain vigilant. There is currently no need to panic, but one must report immediately if they notice any symptoms, the man said.

Dr Tedros, director general of WHO, stated on Thursday [28 Jul 2022] that "the monkeypox outbreak can be stopped if countries, communities, and individuals educate themselves, take the risks seriously, and take the steps needed to stop transmission and protect vulnerable groups."

[My thanks to Mary Marshall, who notes [edited]: It is not clear if this case is included in the 3 cases mentioned in Kerala. It would be unusual with such a small number of cases that one would develop encephalitis and die. The report indicates that the case was laboratory confirmed abroad but does not say where nor which other viruses were included in the tests and excluded. Japanese encephalitis is currently being transmitted in India so there is the possibility of coinfection to be ruled out. It is not indicated if the case was immunocompromised or had co-morbidities that might account for the severe course of the disease terminating in death.

An additional report of 1 Aug 2022 stated that the man who died in India after testing positive for monkeypox in the United Arab Emirates may be Asia's first fatality linked to the global outbreak. Authorities subsequently learned that he'd tested positive for the monkeypox virus on 20 Jul [2022], the day before he returned to India, Veena George, Kerala's health minister, told reporters on Sunday [31 Jul
2022]. (https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-08-01/indian-state-probing-asia-s-first-possible-moneypox-linked-death). - Mod.TY]

[B] Virus sequences

https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/monkeypox-strain-detected-in-india-not-linked-to-europe-outbreak-101659120286079.html


Genome sequencing reports from 2 monkeypox patients in Kerala suggest they were infected with the A.2 strain of the virus, different from the one causing the monkeypox outbreaks in Europe, an analysis by scientists at CSIR Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (CSIR-IGIB).

This A.2 strain, which has largely been found in the US and Thailand, has not been linked to major cluster or super spreader events, unlike the B.1, which has been found in large parts of Europe.

To be sure, there is no evidence yet that suggests either of the strain may be more infectious or virulent.

Vinod Scaria, genome sequencing scientist at IGIB, said that genome sequencing data from 2 monkeypox patients from Kerala belong to the A.2 version of the monkeypox virus, in contrast to the majority of the genomes across the world which belong to the B.1 lineage.

Of the 4 confirmed cases of monkeypox in India, these are the only 2 samples that have been sequenced, for now, officials confirmed.

"Genome sequences have been deposited for 2 samples (EPI_ISL_13953610 and EPI_ISL_13953611) along with 2 re-sequenced genomes from isolates of one of the samples. Both the isolates were from early cases reported from Kerala and both cases have a travel history," Scaria said.

Scaria said that around the world, there are only a few cases that belong to the A.2 strain, and these cases, including the ones from India, seem to all have travel links to the Middle East or West Africa. "The earliest sample in the cluster from the US is indeed from 2021 suggesting the virus has been in circulation for quite some time, and earlier than the European events," he added.

Samples from the monkeypox patients were collected by the National Institute of Virology in Pune, and the genetic sequences of the monkeypox virus have been uploaded to a public database for researchers, GISAID--a global initiative for real time communication for disease prevention.

Dr Ekta Gupta, professor of clinical virology at the Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences (ILBS), said that there is no literature to suggest the B.1 strain is more transmissible than A.2 but based on the outbreak number of cases in Europe, which primarily had B.1 strain, it is being speculated that this virus could be more transmissible. "There is no proof that B.1 is more transmissible but it has spread more and resulted in more cases as compared to A.2, which has been found in the US since 2021 but has not resulted in any major clusters," said Dr Gupta.

But, the prevalence of one mutant over the other could also be the outcome of what is known as a founder effect -- in other words, B.1 may have become more common simply because people infected with it went on to infect more people.

An HIV-positive patient who dropped out of HIV treatment and was infected with monkeypox died on Monday [1 Aug 2022] in Peru, where more than 300 cases have been reported, a health official said.

The 45 year old man "arrived at the hospital in very serious condition with monkeypox. His health had weakened after abandoning his HIV treatment," Dos de Mayo National Hospital director Eduardo Farfan said on local radio. "He did not die of monkeypox, but of sepsis" caused by a weakened immune system, added the director of the hospital located in Lima. "The problem is that this was a patient with other morbidities," which made him more vulnerable "and he decompensated," Mr Farfan said.

Admitted on Wednesday [27 Jul 2022] "highly infected" by the virus, "the germs which invaded his skin compressed his lungs", explained the director of the hospital.

Lithuania has confirmed its 1st case of monkeypox, the country's ministry of health said on Wednesday [3 Aug 2022]. It said the patient, a man in his 40s, is a Lithuanian citizen who has recently returned from another European country. His case was confirmed at the national public health care laboratory.

Galina Zagrebneviene, a chief specialist at the ministry's public health department, told local media the patient's condition is "stable" and he should have been discharged from hospital for further treatment at home. Five people have been identified as his close contacts and preventive measures have been taken accordingly, according to Rasa Liausediene, an adviser to the infectious disease management unit of the National Public Health Centre (NVSC).

The health ministry reported in July [2022] that Lithuania had ordered approximately 1400 monkeypox vaccine doses. Jabs would be administered to close contacts after a high-risk exposure and there would be no possibility for preventive vaccination.

https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Upper-East-Monkeypox-death-13-contacts-traced-1594226


A total of 13 contact persons have been traced to the confirmed monkeypox disease case, which resulted in the death of the victim in Bolgatanga, Dr Emmanuel Kofi Dzotsi, the regional director of the Ghana Health Service (GHS), has said.

He said the Region had recorded 3 suspected cases of the virus in the Bolgatanga Municipality, which were investigated, and noted that one out of the number turned out to be positive. He disclosed that the patient was first seen on 22 Jul 2022 at the Regional hospital with a history of fever and skin rash, and the sample was taken on the same day for confirmation at Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research in Accra.

"We received feedback on the 28 Jul 2022, indicating the sample tested positive for Monkeypox disease. Unfortunately, the case died on the 26 Jul 2022. This is the 1st confirmed case in the region," Dr Dzotsi said in a signed press statement copied to the Ghana News Agency in Bolgatanga. He said the GHS in the Region had put in place measures to contain the spread of the virus, noting that all contacts to the confirmed case were monitored daily, while health professionals were trained and sensitized on the disease. Dr Dzotsi added that the regional directorate had sent outbreak alerts to all health facilities across the districts and municipalities, and stepped-up surveillance on the disease at all health facilities and communities.

Awareness creation and social mobilization on the disease, he said, were intensified, stressing that all public health emergency management committees, public health emergency rapid response teams and case management teams were activated.

The regional director said all holding and isolation centres were also activated and ready to manage cases of the disease. He urged members of the public to remain calm and ensure they avoid skin-to-skin, face-to-face, and mouth-to-skin contact with infected persons and animals, wash hands under running water with soap or use alcohol hand sanitizer. He further entreated residents in the Region to clean objects, surfaces, beddings, and towels regularly, wear face masks if they could not avoid close contact, and when handling bedding, towels, and clothes of an infected person. "Avoid contact with dead animals, report to the nearest clinic or hospital if you have fever and skin rashes," Dr Dzotsi admonished residents.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Background
Since May 2022, a new outbreak of monkeypox has been reported in several countries, including Spain. The clinical and epidemiological characteristics of the cases in this outbreak may differ from earlier reports.

Methods
We conducted a prospective cross-sectional study in multiple medical facilities in Spain to describe the cases of monkeypox in the 2022 outbreak.

Results
In total, 185 patients were included. Most cases started with primarily localised homogeneous papules, not pustules, in the probable area of inoculation, which could be cutaneous or mucous, including single lesions. Generalised small pustules appeared later in some of them. Heterogeneous lesions occurred during this generalised phase. All patients had systemic symptoms. Less common lesions included mucosal ulcers (including pharyngeal ulcers and proctitis) and monkeypox whitlows. Of these cases, 4 patients were hospitalised, and none died. Smallpox vaccination and well-controlled HIV disease were not associated with markers of severity. Contact during sex is the most likely mechanism of transmission. In this outbreak, cases have been described in males having sex with males and are strongly associated with high-risk sexual behaviours. Of the patients, 76 had other sexually transmitted diseases upon screening.

Conclusions
The clinical findings in this outbreak differ from previous findings and highly suggest contact transmission and initiation at the entry site. The characterisation of the epidemiology of this outbreak has implications for control.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Objective
To characterise the clinical features of monkeypox infection in humans.

Design
Descriptive case series.

Setting
A regional high consequences infectious disease centre with associated primary and secondary care referrals, and affiliated sexual health centres in south London between May and July 2022.

Participants
197 patients with polymerase chain reaction confirmed monkeypox infection.

Results
The median age of participants was 38 years. All 197 participants were men, and 196 identified as gay, bisexual, or other men who have sex with men. All presented with mucocutaneous lesions, most commonly on the genitals (n=111 participants, 56.3%) or in the perianal area (n=82, 41.6%). 170 (86.3%) participants reported systemic illness. The most common systemic symptoms were fever (n=122, 61.9%), lymphadenopathy (114, 57.9%), and myalgia (n=62, 31.5%). 102/166 (61.5%) developed systemic features before the onset of mucocutaneous manifestations and 64 (38.5%) after (n=4 unknown). 27 (13.7%) presented exclusively with mucocutaneous manifestations without systemic features. 71 (36.0%) reported rectal pain, 33 (16.8%) sore throat, and 31 (15.7%) penile oedema. 27 (13.7%) had oral lesions and 9 (4.6%) had tonsillar signs. 70/195 (35.9%) participants had concomitant HIV infection. 56 (31.5%) of those screened for sexually transmitted infections had a concomitant sexually transmitted infection. Overall, 20 (10.2%) participants were admitted to hospital for the management of symptoms, most commonly rectal pain, and penile swelling.

Conclusions
These findings confirm the ongoing unprecedented community transmission of monkeypox virus among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men seen in the UK and many other non-endemic countries. A variable temporal association was observed between mucocutaneous and systemic features, suggesting a new clinical course for the disease. New clinical presentations of monkeypox infection were identified, including rectal pain and penile oedema. These presentations should be included in public health messaging to aid early diagnosis and reduce onward transmission.
