The number of suspected cases in a potentially deadly _E. coli_
outbreak has risen to 88, but it appears the Western Fair's petting
zoo has been ruled out as the most likely source. There have only
been 5 confirmed cases of _E. coli_ 0157:H7.
The Middlesex-London [Ontario Health Unit stepped up its
campaign yesterday to test each of the 120 children at a city day
care where one boy has been diagnosed with _E. coli_. Seven
other children at the centre have _E. coli_ symptoms.
There's a good chance the other children from the centre don't
have _E. coli_, said Bryna Warshawsky, associate medical officer
of health. "We're assuming the worst, even though it probably isn't
the case, because we'd rather err on that side."
The health unit could know by Sunday if the children pulled from the
day-care centre have the bacteria or if any other children are
carrying the bug, she said. The centre took a group of children to
the fair, although the boy who got _E. coli_ didn't go on the trip,
director Clo Almeida said yesterday.
There were 30 cows at the fair's agricultural pavilion, but only 1 in
the petting zoo, numbers that make the zoo a less likely candidate
for a bug that generally makes its home in the intestines and
manure of cattle, health unit officials said. Signs warned patrons
not to touch barnyard animals and the pavilion is monitored by fair
employees. But some people likely ignored the warnings and
reached through fences to touch the animals, said fair
spokesperson Anne Eadie.
All 93 people [sic -- says 88 above had symptoms associated with
_E. coli_ and either went to the agricultural pavilion or had contact
with someone who did. Most no longer experience symptoms that
include abdominal cramps and diarrhea.
The rising count -- the number stood at 72 Tuesday -- may not
reflect a spreading disease but instead a rising awareness since
the outbreak was announced Friday by the health unit, officials
said. Since then, nearly 300 people have phoned with questions or
concerns.
Health officials will test animals beginning today and hope for some
results early next week. While odds are stacked against the petting
zoo as a source, animals there will also be tested. Officials are
also asking those with suspected cases which animals they
touched.
Only one of the confirmed cases has caused serious
complications. A 9-year-old boy suffered kidney damage, was
hospitalized for 9 days and will have to be monitored for a year.
The number of cases with active symptoms isn't expected to rise
much, Warshawsky said. The fair ended 19 Sep 1999. Those
exposed there would show symptoms within 8 days. Person-to-
person transmission might come later but would usually be limited
to family.
This year's outbreak is not the first time a strain of _E. coli_ called
0157:H7 struck fear in Londoners. In 1985, the strain was linked to
a London [Ontario nursing home where an outbreak killed 20
elderly residents and afflicted 50 others. At the time it was the
strain's deadliest strike, a gruesome mark since passed.
While other strains of _E. coli_ are not harmful and are found in the
human digestive tract, the so-called hamburger strain can prove
deadly, especially for the young and the elderly.
