Could you please post a correction for the above recent posting. The
outbreak was due to _S._ Newport and has been a reoccurring outbreak
for several years due to contaminated irrigation water.
There is no Salmonella serotype called Norfolk.

[ProMED thanks Susan Van Duyne for her prompt correction of the
serotype involved in this outbreak. The original posting from CIDRAP
contained both Norfolk and Newport with Norfolk in the beginning and
end parts of the text. As noted in the original posting
(20061202.3409), this moderator mentioned this and had, mistakenly,
changed each Newport to Norfolk. - Mod.LL]
