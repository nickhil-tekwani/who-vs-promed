Use of anthrax vaccine in response to terrorism: supplemental
recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices
In December 2000, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)
released its recommendations for using anthrax vaccine in the United States
(1). Because of recent terrorist attacks involving the intentional exposure
of US civilians to _Bacillus anthracis_ spores and concerns that the
current anthrax vaccine supply is limited, ACIP developed supplemental
recommendations on using anthrax vaccine in response to terrorism. These
recommendations supplement the previous ACIP statement in three areas:
- use of anthrax vaccine for pre-exposure vaccination in the US civilian
population
- prevention of anthrax by post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP)
- recommendations for additional research related to using antimicrobial
agents and anthrax vaccine for preventing anthrax.
