Abstract:
A re-emergence of anthrax, a zoonosis caused by the long-lived, spore-forming _Bacillus anthracis_, occurred with a multispecies outbreak in southwestern Montana, USA, in 2008. It substantially impacted a managed herd of about 3500 free-ranging plains bison (_Bison bison bison_) on a large, private ranch southwest of Bozeman, with about 8% mortality and a disproportionate 28% mortality of mature males; a similar high rate occurred in male Rocky Mountain elk (_Cervus canadensis nelson_). Grazing herbivores are particularly at risk for anthrax from ingesting spore-contaminated soil and grasses in persistent environmental reservoirs. We predicted areas of mature male bison habitat preference on the landscape by using GPS collar data and a resource selection function model using environmental covariates. We overlaid preferred areas with ecologic niche, model-based predictions of _B. anthracis_ environmental reservoirs to identify areas of high anthrax risk. Overlapping areas were distributed across the ranch and were not confined to pastures associated with the previous outbreak, suggesting that ongoing pasture exclusion alone will not prevent future outbreaks. The data suggested vaccination campaigns should continue for bison, and the results can be used to prioritize carcass surveillance in areas of greatest overlap.

Discussion:
To illustrate areas to be most likely selected by male bison, we mapped the top 5 resource selection function bins (preferred habitat areas) onto the landscape. Preferred areas were in the central and northeastern portions of the ranch. The preferred areas overlapped with potential risk zones across 118 sq km [46 sq mi], or about 30% of the area of the ranch. Overlap areas were spread across the ranch and not confined to specific pastures. In an effort to prevent disease, bison grazing access has been restricted during the seasonal risk period, and bison remain entirely excluded from pastures that exhibited the highest mortality in 2008. However, our results suggested that there are risk areas available to male bison despite exclusion efforts and that this practice alone may not prevent future outbreaks.

We defined the anthrax risk season as June-August based on the 2008 and 2010 cases. This period overlaps bison rut, wherein sexually mature male bison are competing against each other. Rut may alter the bison behaviors (e.g., wallowing) and space preferences; stress from rut may increase infection risk and movement away from the herd after rut may make finding dead males difficult. Although our sample size was limited to 3 individual males, model validation indicated high accuracy for predicting habitat selection during the seasonal anthrax risk period, despite variation in these 3 individuals. Future work should increase the number of collared bison. Overall, surveillance is advised, particularly in areas of high bison-anthrax risk overlap, including diagnostic testing for any bison deaths in summer. Likewise, disease risk extends beyond current excluded pastures, indicating vaccination should continue. Nearby ranches should also perform testing for unusual livestock deaths in summer and consider vaccination.

[The ability of niche modes to predict where new outbreaks of anthrax might occur is phenomenal. It is not just GIS mental gymnastics; it also has an immediate purpose in improving the quality of control and surveillance. "Maps" are very persuasive and can concentrate the minds of ancillary folk to be on a better lookout for new cases and to report them. And this is important, as a quick response limits the risk of additional soil contamination and can recruit folk in surrounding ranches to be on the lookout for cases in literally their backyards. Exercises such as this one on Turner's Flying-D ranch improves knowing where to look and how to better instruct ranch staff, who are the feet and eyes on the ground. Management is off in an office drinking coffee. Ranch hands matter. - Mod.MHJ
