The 1st report of a sick and coughing bighorn was reported in early May of this year [2015, in Joshua Tree National Park, California]. In mid-August [2015], a dead lamb was found in the park and sent to a laboratory for necropsy. The results of laboratory analysis of blood and tissue samples confirmed that the animal was infected with pneumonia. The mortality rate for animals infected is 50-90 percent and there is no vaccine or cure. This form of disease typically enters into a population from contact with domestic sheep or goats. Biologists caution the public to avoid releasing domestic sheep or goats into the wild since they can carry the disease and show no clinical signs. An outbreak such as this can cause a long term decline in the population that can last more than a decade.

Biologists have a formed an interagency task-force to monitor outbreaks, suggest best practices for limiting the range and effects of the disease and provide recommendations for management actions.

[Bighorn sheep pneumonia has traditionally been considered a multifactorial disease, caused by multiple pathogens. Due to their complexity, understanding multifactorial phenomena like this, usually requires integrated and sustained research efforts. The absence of established and universal explanations for pneumonia outbreaks contributes to conflict among wildlife and livestock stakeholders over land use and management practices.

The bighorn sheep pneumonia web of causation may have an important environmental component. In recent years, die-offs of bighorn sheep in several locations suggests that the proximate cause of these events may be a shared environmental determinant.

However, recent evidence indicates that in northwestern USA there seems to be a pathogen implicated in bighorn sheep outbreaks, _Mycoplasma ovipneumoniae_, an exotic disease agent for North America, introduced by domestic ovids.
