Another 5 Formosan ferret-badgers with rabies were confirmed yesterday [28 Jul 2013], bringing the total to 11 since the virus reappeared in Taiwan.

Though confirmed rabies cases are mounting, it is currently impossible to judge whether the epidemic is spreading around the island, said Chang Shu-hsien, head of the Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine (BAPHIQ). With the entire nation on the lookout for potential cases, reports and examinations have been increasing, as have positive cases, but the BAPHIQ hopes to curb the spread of the disease in mountainous areas, said Chang, after the Cabinet's 4th meeting on the issue. Chen Bao-ji, minister of the Council of Agriculture (COA), called for the public not to panic but also not to let down their guard. "The government has been strictly monitoring the development of rabies; the goal is to prevent humans, dogs and cats from catching the disease," said Chen.

Five stray dogs were found dead in the streets of Nantou's Puli Township yesterday [28 Jul 2013], apparently due to poisoning. The incident is suspected to be an attempt to weed out possible rabies carriers, said the Puli Township Office. According to the office, there had been complaints from residents that there had been more than 10 stray dogs roaming Puli's streets. The township had been planning to round up the strays on its weekly dog-catching beat on Wednesday [31 Jul 2013]. One of the bodies was sent to the local animal disease control center for further examination.

When asked whether the government will consider airdropping vaccinations into affected mountainous areas, Chang said that people were reported to have contracted rabies after venturing into mountains in the U.S. where the government had airdropped live vaccines to stop an outbreak. Although Taiwan's rabies vaccination [campaign] is inactivate and [the baited virus would] pose no threat to humans if airdropped, this is not yet being considered.

There are an estimated 1.5 million dogs and cats in the nation, 40 percent of which are required to be vaccinated annually against rabies, said the BAPHIQ. 60 000 vaccinations are left from the 100 000 kept by the government for emergency use, and an additional 300 000 [doses of vaccine] will be imported at the end of August [2013], the bureau added.

[As yet, the Taiwan Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine (BAPHIQ) cannot confirm that ferret-badger rabies is spreading in Taiwan or establish whether it is newly introduced or has been present cryptically in the ferret-badger population for some years. The increase in number of cases reported above may merely reflect the current enhanced surveillance. So far, there is no evidence that the disease has spread from the ferret-badger population, apart from a single suspected human exposure under as yet unexplained circumstances. However, it is obviously prudent to plan to extend rabies vaccination to cover all domestic dogs and cats, as is apparently already the case with working dogs.

The Chinese/Formosan ferret-badger (_Melogale moschata_), also known as the small-toothed ferret-badger, is a member of the family _Mustelidae_. This badger lives in burrows or crevices and is active at dusk and at night. It is a good climber and feeds on fruit, insects, small animals, and worms. They are shy animals but savage when alarmed. The average body size of the Chinese/Formosan ferret-badger is 33 to 43 centimetres (13 to 17 inches) with a tail of 15 to 23 centimetres (5.9 to 9.1 inches). It lives in grassland, open forest, and tropical rainforest from northeastern India to southern China, Taiwan, and northern Indochina.
