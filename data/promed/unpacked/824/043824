An increase in the number of cases of pertussis, also known as whooping cough, is being seen in the Princeton area [British Columbia]. Interior Health would like to remind the public about the importance of making sure your immunizations are up to date.

The pertussis vaccine is part of the routine childhood vaccinations that are given at 2 months, 4 months, 6 months, and 18 months old, and again at age 4 to 6 years (before kindergarten). A pertussis vaccine is also given to teens at 14 to 16 years of age (grade 9) in British Columbia. The vaccine is safe and effective and parents are advised to check their child's immunization record to make sure they are up to date. It is especially important that infants receive the first dose of pertussis vaccine on time and without delay to protect them from serious pertussis complications.

Information about accessing immunization records can be found at ImmunizeBC (http://www.immunizebc.ca. To discuss pertussis immunization for children or to book an appointment, contact your local public health centre. Adults who have never been immunized for pertussis can contact their local health centre to inquire about getting the vaccine.

The Similkameen Country is mostly in the traditional territory of the Similkameen subdivision of the Okanagan people, the Upper Similkameen Indian Band being in the town of Princeton, which has a population of 2828 residents (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princeton,_British_Columbia).

Alberta Health Services (AHS) says a whooping cough outbreak in southern Alberta has now impacted 38 people. The outbreak was originally declared last week [week of 5 Jun 2017] after 17 cases were detected in communities with low immunization rates.

"This outbreak is in the same area where we are seeing outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases on a regular basis," Dr Vivien Suttorp, a medical officer of health for AHS South zone said in an interview on [7 Jun 2017]. At the time, the outbreak had been contained to the western part of the AHS South zone and was limited to the communities around Lethbridge, Coaldale, and Fort Macleod. This week, however, cases related to the outbreak have been detected across southern Alberta, including 3 cases in Medicine Hat.

No outbreaks have been declared in Alberta's 4 other zones but AHS says there have been 178 cases across Alberta so far this year [2017], including 18 in Calgary, 27 in Edmonton and 77 in the province's central zone, which includes Red Deer.

According to AHS, immunization is the best protection against whooping cough. The vaccine is part of Alberta's routine childhood immunization schedule. Doses of the DTaP vaccine -- which delivers protection against diphtheria, whooping cough, tetanus and polio -- are recommended for all children at ages 2 months, 4 months, 6 months, 18 months, between 4 and 6 years, and again in grade 9.

Adults are urged to get a booster at some point and it's recommended pregnant women get the vaccine during their third trimester of pregnancy. The vaccine is covered by Alberta Health and can be accessed through community health centres or public health offices.
