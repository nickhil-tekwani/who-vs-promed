Anthrax in the area of Smihel under Nanos last week killed a cow, and [authorities] are constantly on the lookout for new signs of infection. It appears that the bacterium did not contaminate other animals, but long-term safeguards will be implemented in the territory.

The Administration Office for Food Safety, Veterinary and Plant Protection have denied rumors of more infected animals. "According to the information received, there are no new cases of anthrax disease. The farm was the site of the single case, and we are implementing all measures of disinfection and vaccination of animals, " Matjaz Emersic, Spokesman of the Management Board, announced.

After 7 long years without anthrax, it reappeared in August 2015, in the area of Vrhnika. [see: 20150828.3607163 ]

Anthrax was discovered in the area of Smihel Nanos last Wed 9 Dec 2015. Immediately after confirmation of disease on the holding, measures were introduced to prevent spread and eradicate the disease. Livestock movement is banned; vaccination of susceptible animals grazing in the area of the district as well as animals which are fed with feed originating from the district. Protective measures will [continue to] be implemented for a further 50 years, because it is a disease that is very difficult to eradicate. People who have had contact with an [infected] animal should take antibiotics.

Administration of all cases of the disease and of measures carried out through a system of notification and reporting of animal diseases (ADNS) shall inform the Commission and other Member States.

[To find Smihel-under-Nanos in SW Slovenia, go to: http://www.fallingrain.com/world/SI/94/Smihel_pod_Nanosom.html. It is some distance from the previous outbreak in Vrhnika (http://www.fallingrain.com/world/SI/E5/Vrhnika.html) which is SW of the capital Ljubljana (see http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/europe/slovenia_pol00.jpg).

As it is now winter and livestock will be housed, it would be logical to suspect a source related to the feed fed this herd. This risk is also perceived by the Slovenian authorities, in that they have initiated vaccination of stock so fed. The details of the source must await the results of any investigations from the Slovenian authorities. - Mod.MHJ]
