EU bans South African citrus for 2012/13 season
-----------------------------------------------
The European Union has placed a ban on South African citrus for the remainder of the 2012/13 season. This is after 36 interceptions where citrus black spot was found.

This ban will have no significance for this season as all citrus exports to the EU from South Africa have finished, but the impact of the ban being continued over to the 2013/14 would not only have a big effect on the South African citrus industry, but other markets around the world.

Copa-Cogeca [EU Committees of farmer organisations and rural cooperatives] said, "What we want is measures for 2014. We faced a very high risk of contamination this [2013] season and we cannot repeat it next year. It is crucial to protect our 500 000 hectares [1.24 million acres] of European citrus orchards. We urge the Commission to suspend the import of citrus fruit from South Africa in 2014."

[Citrus black spot (CBS) caused by the fungus _Guignardia citricarpa_ is one of the most serious diseases of the crops in Asia and regions of the southern hemisphere. Symptoms can occur on leaves but are most severe on fruit. They include sunken lesions of varying size, shape, and colour depending on stage of fruit or leaf development. The disease may also lead to post-harvest losses since fruit may not show visible symptoms while on the tree. However, characteristic lesions may develop in storage under suitable conditions. Fungal strains which do not cause symptoms also exist. Black spot causes significant losses due to premature fruit and leaf drop and disfiguration of fruit for fresh markets.

Spores are produced under fallen leaves and sometimes on fruit. Spread occurs by air currents, on contaminated plant material (including nursery plants or scions with latent infections), and by mechanical means. The disease is particularly virulent late in the season, and losses tend to be most severe in late maturing varieties. All commercial citrus cultivars are susceptible to varying extents, except for sour orange (_Citrus aurantium_). Disease management includes fungicides, phytosanitation, and pathogen exclusion.

The threat of CBS introduction has been an issue in Europe for several years. The disease has been included in the A1 quarantine list of the European Plant Protection Organisation (EPPO). CBS has also recently been introduced into the USA by unknown means (2010; ProMED-mail post 20100412.1183), and this further illustrates the risk to northern hemisphere citrus industries. Once established in a region, eradication of a sporulating fungus such as _G. citricarpa_ is considered impossible.

The EU ban follows an alert earlier this year (2013; ProMED-mail post 20130919.1956795). The EC has repeatedly called on South African authorities for measures to prevent introduction of the disease into Europe, and certification of freedom from black spot is already required for citrus imports from South Africa. The report above states that nevertheless 36 interceptions from that country have been put on record in 2013, and not all contaminated shipments may have been detected. The large number of quarantine detections implies that certification of disease freedom at point of origin is not working effectively. It therefore appears that an import ban is indeed required to protect European citrus industries.
