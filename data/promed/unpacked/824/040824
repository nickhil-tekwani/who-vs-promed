Cyclospora outbreak in Toronto, Ontario
--------------------------------------
A cluster of 40 cases of cyclosporiasis (14 confirmed, 27 suspected)
has been detected among a group of 63 persons (55 students and 8
teachers/chaperones) who attended a school retreat West of Toronto.
Epidemiologic analysis has revealed a significant association with a
pasta salad dish which contained fresh basil. The source of the basil
has not been confirmed, but is believed to have originated in a Latin
American country.
Toronto Public Health continues to investigate the source of the
outbreak in cooperation with the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, the
Ontario Ministry of Health and Long Term Care, Health Canada, and the
Public Health Agency of Canada.

[We thank Effie Gournis for this official report. Outbreaks of
cyclosporiasis occur regularly in Canada and the U.S., and ProMED has
carried more reports from North America than from Europe (U.K. and Germany).
Cyclosporiasis is probably imported frequently with lettuce and berries, and
the review we published in 1997 (Cyclosporiasis review 19970930.2072)
estimated 1600-1700 cases in the U.S. and Canada annually. - Mod.EP]
