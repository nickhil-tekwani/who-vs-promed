CHRONIC WASTING DISEASE, CERVID - USA (18): (ARKANSAS) ELK, CORRECTION
**********************************************************************
A ProMED-mail post

ProMED-mail is a program of the

[Yesterday, 18 Nov 2016, I made the following statement in ProMED-mail posting 20161118.4637245:

"This appears to be a new species affected within the Arkansas border; elk has not been reported as CWD positive in Arkansas until now. The disease appears to be in the more northern region of the state. The article does not indicate if the animal was a farmed or free range animal. It only says it was on private land, which does not mean it was behind a high fence. - Mod.TG"

I would like to apologize to the ProMED-mail readers for the error. I would also like to thank the readers for their attention to detail and kind ways of calling out this mistake. Some of those are listed below. Thank you to all of you who submitted corrections. - Mod.TG]

Just a fact check -- the 1st case of CWD [chronic wasting disease] reported in Arkansas last year [2015] was in an elk. No doubt there are many more within the endemic zone who will be found to be positive -- the prevalence rates in white-tailed deer in that area were some of the highest reported in free-ranging populations.

County / CWD-positive deer / CWD-positive elk
Newton / 94 / 5

In comment to the recent Arkansas CWD post of a single CWD-positive elk being identified in Searcy County, Arkansas from this fall's hunting season, moderator TG states that "This appears to be a new species affected within the Arkansas border; elk has not been reported as CWD positive in Arkansas until now." I believe that this statement may be inaccurate as the Arkansas Game and Fish CWD website (link below) states that there have been 5 CWD-positive elk from Newton County starting with the 1st positive elk identified on 23 Feb 2016.

Please see the reference from the AGF CWD website:

[Thank you to all who sent me messages and I seem to have been asleep at the keyboard with that incorrect message. So in doing some research and digging through some archives, I noted that Arkansas does not allow high fences or captive deer or elk for private citizens. The Arkansas elk are from a relocation program done back in the 1980s. I noted from some archives that some thought those relocations are to blame as the source for the current CWD diagnosis in white-tailed deer in northern Arkansas. I cannot comment on what I found other than to say firm evidence has not been published and nor has any epidemiological work been done to support this accusation that I could find. - Mod.TG
