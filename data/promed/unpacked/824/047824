UK-wide outbreak of mumps among students
-----------------------------------------
Universities across the UK are launching a mass MMR vaccination campaign in
a bid to control the latest outbreak of mumps among students. The Health
Protection Agency (HPA) believes that nearly 3000 students and young people
could be infected with mumps by the end of the year [2004] if the current
outbreak continues.
One possible reason for the epidemic could be due to the disease occurring
in people who were too old to have been offered the MMR vaccines routinely
as children. "These youngsters (currently aged between 14 and 22 years,
born 1982-1990) would have been offered a single measles vaccine, and most
will have had the combined measles and rubella vaccine," said Dr. Mary
Ramsay from the HPA. "However, only a few will have received MMR vaccine,
and hardly any will have received a 2nd dose of MMR, which is important in
securing good levels of protection. We recommend that those in this age
group, for example school leavers and those starting university, who have
not received MMR, or had only one dose, should be offered MMR."
Universities in Oxford, Manchester, Leeds, Kent, Nottingham, and Birmingham
are planning campus vaccination days as well as raising the profile of the
disease through student websites and newspapers. (Based on a News release
from NHS Health Development Agency.

[This outbreak is not a direct consequence of the current reduced uptake of
the MMR triple vaccine in the UK due to the activities of single-issue
pressure groups, but it does illustrate the need for awareness of potential
gaps in vaccine coverage in vulnerable groups. - Mod.CP]
