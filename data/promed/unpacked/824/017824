An unknown disease affecting livestock in Nayagarh district [Odisha state] has become a cause of concern among the farmers here.

Ten cattle have died, and about 500 more are suffering from this disease in the last 15 days at NAC [Notified Area Council] and Ranpur block areas of this district.

According to local farmers, the animals initially develop blisters on their skin that lead to wounds after several days. These blisters initially come upon the joints of the front legs of the animals. Eventually, they become immobile and partly unconscious for a few days, following which they die.

The farmers are also at a loss as to how to treat their cattle and manage to farm at the same time. They suspect it to be a kind of pox.

That said, some of the cattle undergoing treatment at the veterinary center here have shown improvement.

Local veterinary officer Jagdish Mishra claimed to be aware of the issue and said that the disease is curable. He has asked the farmers to seek help from nearby livestock inspectors to get their domestic animals tested.

[The clinical signs described above lack detail and, probably, accuracy, but the report includes a photo of a cow with skin lesions which closely resemble lumpy skin disease (LSD). The nodules seem smaller than the ones usually observed in acute LSD cases in European (_Bos taurus_) cattle breeds; thick-skinned _Bos indicus_ breeds are known to present less severe signs of the disease.

According to the media (see 20190826.6641695), in August 2019, a similar cattle disease has been spreading in Odisha (India's state which was earlier spelled as Orissa), namely in the district Mayurbhanj (map at https://tinyurl.com/y62fvjhb). The reports mentioned the locations Khunta, Badasahi, Gopabandhunagar, Dharampur and Nuasahi. The current media report refers to the district Nayagarh (map at https://tinyurl.com/y5qw9afk).

LSD has been so far termed by India as a "never reported" disease. In August 2019, the disease was reported for the 1st time from China (Xinjiang province). Xinjiang borders India's state Jammu and Kashmir.

LSD, a serious, infectious, non-zoonotic, viral capripox disease of cattle, which in the past belonged to OIE's List A diseases, has, very likely, been circulating in India for at least 3 months. Early laboratory investigation of the cases is warranted, followed -- if confirmed -- by immediate official notification to the OIE. - Mod.AS
