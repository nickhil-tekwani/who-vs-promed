The World Health Organization (WHO) says 42 suspected cases of Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) have been detected in the Nakivale Refugee Settlement in northern Uganda. In its latest epidemiological analysis, WHO said the 1st case, involving a female who came from Rwanda through the Democratic Republic of Congo, was confirmed by the Uganda Virus Research Institute on 18 Jul [2018].

"She presented with a 4-day history of fever and a bleeding diathesis [on 7 Jul 2018]. By [17 Jul 2018] the husband of the index case had tested positive for CCHF. No deaths have been reported and both cases are in isolation at the Mbarara Regional Referral Hospital," the WHO said.

Meanwhile, the WHO says at least 3 of 8 suspected cases of Rift Valley fever have died since the outbreak was confirmed at a farm in the Nakivale Refugee Camp on 28 Jun 2018.

Efforts to identify the source of the outbreak are still underway. Teams from the government and the WHO are working on outbreak responses. As of 17 Jul 2018, samples had been taken from 125 animals, including 95 cattle, 27 goats and 3 sheep.

"Case management is being provided at the isolation facility at Mbarara Regional Referral Hospital, and health workers are being instructed by clinicians deployed as part of the RRT. Affected districts are being prepared to manage cases at source," the WHO said.

[From the above report, it seems that the disease was imported through the thus far identified 1st case coming from Rwanda. Considering the close living conditions in most refugee settlements, contact-based transmission from this case is likely. However, as cattle and animals are also part of such settlements, the investigation of the animal samples as mentioned above is appropriate. CCHF is another example of a zoonosis that requires close and consistent coordination of health, veterinary and vector control departments, and countries that are endemic for the disease should establish a surveillance and monitoring program for animal and vector aspects with availability of rapid diagnostics in suspected human cases. - Mod.UBA
