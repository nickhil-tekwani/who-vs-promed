[A wilt disease of canola, collectively _Brassica napus_, and _B. rapa_,
was first observed in fields near Fort Vermilion and Andrew, Alberta,
Canada in 1999 by Ralph Lange and Prem Kharbanda of the Alberta Research
Council and Lorraine Harrison of Alberta Agriculture, Food and Rural
Development. [According to crop surveys in 2000, the disease now occurs
throughout east-central Alberta and in the Peace River district of northern
Alberta. It has also been found in Saskatchewan and Manitoba. [This is the
first detailed report of the disease in North America.
According to Lange, _Fusarium_ wilt is distinct from other important canola
diseases, [because plants do not lodge like those affected by blackleg or
_Sclerotinia_ stem rot. The roots [of infected plants remain relatively
intact, unlike symptoms prevalent in [plants infected with brown girdling
root rot disease. _Fusarium_ wilt is also unique in how it affects the
plant. In some cases, only a part of the plant, such as half a stem or a
single branch, is infected and the remainder of the plant remains
relatively symptom-free.
_Fusarium wilt_ has been identified as an emerging disease in oilseed
crops. Until the first case, wilt diseases were unknown in canola crops in
western Canada. In 1999, the disease caused yield losses of 30 percent or
more in canola fields.
Little information is available on resistance to _Fusarium_ wilt. Symptoms
of the disease are only visible in plants shortly before harvesting.
Consequently, the disease is poorly understood. Scientists at the Alberta
Research Council are studying how the disease invades the canola plant.
Field trials conducted [during the 2000 crop year indicate that some
[currently available cultivars of _B. napus_ are resistant to _Fusarium_ wilt.
Further research is being conducted to [to develop canola cultivars with
resistance to the disease. Research to identify resistance-based control
methods is also being conducted.

[According to Lange, the etiology of the disease is not clearly known. _F.
avenaceum_ is the primary pathogen but _F. oxysporum_ may also be involved
in disease induction. _F. avenaceum_ is generally regarded as a root rot
pathogen, not known to cause wilt symptoms. If the disease in canola is
determined to be a true vascular wilt disease, use of foliar fungicides may
be effective in disease management. Symptoms of canola wilt disease include
yellowing, wilting, followed by senescence, and poor filling of seed,
followed by death of the plant. _Fusarium_ spp. can survive for long
periods in soil, and thus disease management by crop rotation may be
ineffective. There is no evidence of seed transmission of _F. avenaceum_ in
canola. Lange said that the results of crop surveys indicated that the
disease occurred on _B. rapa_ in 1999 but not in 2000. - Mod.DH
