The Federal Office of Public Health external link said on Monday [1 Apr 2019] that 55 cases of measles were reported in March [2019], nearly twice the number of cases registered at the beginning of the year [2019].

In all, 97 cases have been recorded in 2019, the office said. This compares to 15 cases during the same 3-month period at the start of last year [2018]. In 2018, there were a total of 48 measles cases, and in 2017, there were 105.

In the World Health Organization external link (WHO)'s European region, which covers nearly 900 million people, some 82 600 in 47 countries contracted measles last year [2018], the highest number this decade. Of those, 72 cases were fatal. The worst-affected countries were Ukraine (53 000 cases), followed by Serbia (5076), Israel (2919), France (2913), Russia (2256), Italy (2517), Georgia (2203), and Greece (2193). Six of the 53 countries did not report.

The record number in Europe is partly due to a growing number of pockets where parents are refusing vaccination for their children, the WHO said in February [2019]. At the same time, the WHO said, record numbers of children are getting the vaccine, offering hope that the rise in infections may not last.

In 1987, the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health announced a vaccination strategy that it hoped would eradicate measles by the year 2000. To eradicate measles, the WHO advocates a vaccination coverage of 95% of the population. Swiss coverage is currently below this at 87% for 2-year-olds and 93% for 16-year-olds.

In Switzerland, there are large differences between cantons, with more urban cantons reaching a near-100% level, while rural areas score much lower, with the lowest vaccination rate in the tiny canton of Appenzell Inner Rhodes at 82%.

https://www.dutchnews.nl/news/2019/04/three-cases-of-measles-at-creche-in-the-hague-children-not-vaccinated/


Three children at a creche in The Hague have come down with measles, and a 4th child may have the disease, public broadcaster NOS reports. The children involved had not been vaccinated, and one of them may have caught the disease when on holiday, the broadcaster said. One of the children is over the age of 14 months, when it should have been vaccinated against the disease, but the others are younger.

The children in The Hague bring the total measles cases in the Netherlands to 12 so far this year [2019], compared with an average annual infection rate of 10-20.

The RIVM public health institute said that at the moment no link can be made between The Hague cases and the drop in the number of children being vaccinated in the Netherlands. Currently, 90.2% of Dutch children are vaccinated against potentially serious illnesses such as measles, polio, and whooping cough. This is below the level of 95% the World Health Organisation considers safe.

Vaccine uptake has been declining, prompting a government information campaign, while daycare centres have been demanding the right to refuse children who have not been vaccinated. At the moment this is not yet legally possible.

The last measles epidemic in the Netherlands hit the Dutch Bible belt in 2013. In total, 2600 people were diagnosed with measles, and the outbreak was concentrated in families with young children who had not been vaccinated for religious reasons. One girl, who had not been vaccinated, died.

The Massachusetts Department of Public Health is issuing a measles warning after a person in the greater Boston area was diagnosed with the disease on Sunday [31 Mar 2019]. The victim went to several public locations while infectious and could have spread the virus to other people.

"The measles virus is currently causing large national and international outbreaks of measles, and a lack of vaccination, combined with domestic and international travel, has resulted in the spread of illness," said Dr. Catherine Brown, Massachusetts state epidemiologist. "Getting vaccinated is the best way to protect yourself from this disease."

In a follow-up on the measles outbreak in southeast Michigan, state health officials reported 8 additional confirmed measles cases in Oakland County, bringing the outbreak total to 30. The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) reports 29 cases in Oakland County and one case in Wayne County.

MDHHS is working closely with Oakland and Wayne county health departments to identify possible exposure locations.

MDHHS follows Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance and does not recommend routine measles vaccinations for children less than 12 months of age unless there is a suspected measles exposure, there is thought to be an imminent measles exposure such as being in areas of known measles, or international travel is planned.

For international travel, infants as young as 6 months should be vaccinated against measles. Measles vaccine, or other acceptable documentation of immunity to measles, is recommended for all persons travelling internationally. [The vaccine] is effective within 72 hours of exposure to prevent illness. In addition, immune globulin (Ig) treatment is effective within 6 days of exposure for high-risk individuals. Talk to your healthcare provider to determine if immune globulin is right for you and if it is available.

Twelve new cases of measles have been confirmed this week [week of Mon 1 Apr 2019] in Oakland County, according to the state Department of Health and Human Services. Four were confirmed Tuesday [2 Apr 2019], and 8 other cases were announced Monday [1 Apr 2019].

That brings the total number of measles cases in Michigan this year [2019] to 34. All but one are in Oakland County. Wayne County reported a single case in March [2019].

Those who have been infected with measles in Michigan range in age from 8 months to 63 years old, the MDHHS reports. The last time the state had this many measles cases was in 1991, when 65 cases were reported.

"Most of the cases so far have been in adults," said Lynn Sutfin, a spokeswoman for the MDHHS, which highlights why it's important to know your immunization status.

"Many things could contribute to vaccine failure. If an individual was immune-compromised at the time the vaccine was administered or had something going on with their immune system, that could have prevented them from responding to the vaccine," Sutfin said. "It could also be the way the vaccine was handled. If not stored properly, the viability of the vaccine could be impacted. Finally, everybody's immunize system is different, and for some reason some individuals do not respond to the vaccine."

An unvaccinated new mother at the Poriya Medical Center in northern Israel was diagnosed Sunday [31 Mar 2019] evening with measles and placed in an isolation room, Kan 11 reported.

All 26 newborns in the nursery, their mothers, and the baby born to the infected woman were given immunoglobulin.

The infected woman gave birth on Fri 29 Mar 2019 evening and broke out with a rash the next day. Examinations showed that she was ill with measles.

The hospital emphasized that the issue "is being dealt with and is under control. There is no danger to other new mothers or patients."

According to the Ministry of Health, by 14 Feb 2019, there had been 3505 confirmed cases of measles. By 18 Mar 2019, the number had jumped to 3701 confirmed cases for a total of 196 new cases in 4 weeks, or approximately 6 new cases every day.

Since then, there have been several additional cases, including 3 daycare children in Lod.

Jerusalem leads the outbreak with 1338 confirmed cases, and Beit Shemesh places 2nd, with 413. Lagging behind are Tzfat (265), Beitar Illit (228), Bnei Brak (206), Modi'in Illit (114), and Tel Aviv-Yafo (102).

In the double digits are Tiberias (51), Rehovot (39), Petah Tikva (35), Migdal Ha'emek (28), Hatzor Hagalilit (26), Or Haganuz (25), and Immanuel (24). Elon Moreh, Kiryat Ye'arim, and Bat Ayin have each registered 23 measles cases, while both Hevron and Yitzhar have registered 21.

https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/pinoyabroad/news/689872/four-filipinos-in-hong-kong-infected-with-measles-amid-outbreak/story/


The Philippine Consul in Hong Kong confirmed that of the 30 people who have been infected with measles in Hong Kong, 6 of them came from the Philippines, and of these 6, 4 are Filipinos working as household helpers.

The 5th person who got infected with measles is a Filipino but his profession was not mentioned. The 6th individual infected, on the other hand, is a foreigner who visited the Philippines.

The measles outbreak has prompted Hong Kong's Department of Food and Health to advise Filipinos who went on vacation in the Philippines to have themselves vaccinated against measles 1st before going back to work in Hong Kong.

The advisory from Hong Kong's Department of Food and Health has also been sent to overseas Filipino worker (OFW) organizations.

A dialogue among Hong Kong's Health department officials and OFW groups has been set to identify clear guidelines on how to implement the policy in light of the outbreak.

Canete said the dialogue is expected to determine whether those who have been vaccinated before would still have to get vaccinated with an anti-measles shot, and who should pay for the anti-measles vaccine of household service workers.

http://www.ejinsight.com/20190403-first-measles-case-involving-healthcare-worker-reported/


Four more people were confirmed to have contracted measles in the city, taking the number of such cases this year [2019] to 40.

Three of the 4 new measles patients work at the airport, while the 4th is a radiographer working at Princess Margaret Hospital, according to the Department of Health's Centre for Health Protection (CHP) and the Hospital Authority (HA).

All are males in their 20s with good health records. They are now in stable condition.

This is the 1st time that a healthcare worker has been infected by the measles virus since the current outbreak began, the Hong Kong Economic Journal reported.

According to the CHP, the 23-year-old radiographer, who developed fever and a rash on Mon 1 Apr 2019 before being admitted to the hospital, had not worked in any of the high-risk wards during his communicable period.

He also had no recent travel history, nor did he visit the airport in the past few days.

The 3 other patients include a 23-year-old man who works at the Cathay Pacific Cargo Terminal located at the Hong Kong International Airport, and 2 workers, aged 23 and 29, assigned at Terminal 1. 19 of the 40 measles cases that have been confirmed so far are airport or airline workers.

The Department of Health expects the measles outbreak at the airport to continue in the days ahead, and as such, control measures being implemented there will go on for some time until further notice.

Detailed arrangements will depend on the latest situation and will be announced in due course.

At least 124 people have received measles jabs at the vaccination stations set up at the airport, bringing the cumulative number of vaccinations so far given there to 7645.

Dr. Ho Pak-leung, president of the Carol Yu Centre for Infection at the University of Hong Kong, said on Wed 3 Apr 2019 that it is now certain that a 2nd round of infections has emerged.

[11] Australia (Darwin-Palmerston area)
Date: Thu 28 Mar 2019

https://health.nt.gov.au/news/update-measles-outbreak


Cases of measles notified in the Darwin-Palmerston area since mid-February 2019 have increased to 12 [see following report re. 23 total cases], and more are currently being assessed for this very contagious disease.

Territorians are being asked to get their free measles-containing vaccine, known as the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine if they are not immune and to be aware of measles symptoms.

The Centre for Disease Control (CDC) is contacting more than 700 people, who have been identified as having had potential contact with cases to provide information and offer preventive immunisation if appropriate.

"For the majority of cases, however, there is no direct link to the previous cases and no recent overseas travel. That means that measles is likely being spread in very public places," said Dr Vicki Krause, Director at the CDC.

"All recent cases either live or work in the Palmerston area, but have travelled widely in the Darwin-Palmerston area and beyond while infectious, so there could be cases emerging throughout the Territory, and beyond. As an example, one case who acquired measles in Palmerston was diagnosed after travelling to a southern state.

"If you are not immune to measles, it can be caught easily in public places such as shopping centres, pharmacies, waiting rooms, fast food areas, dance classes, etc. Stores and shopping centres in Palmerston have been repeatedly visited by recent infectious cases."

"It is very common to catch measles while travelling overseas, so all travellers need to ensure they are immune to measles before travelling. Measles is circulating widely throughout the world at the moment, including Europe," Dr Krause said.

[12] Australia: measles update - vaccination program extended
Date: Thu 28 Mar 2019

https://health.nt.gov.au/news/measles-update-vaccination-program-extended


As all of the measles cases have occurred in the Darwin-Palmerston, the Centre for Disease Control (CDC) has extended the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine to include 9-12 month-old babies in the Greater Darwin area while the virus is circulating.

"We understand that parents wish to protect their children, and so for the course of this outbreak, the MMR vaccine can now be given to babies in the outbreak area who are 9-12 months old," CDC Director Dr Vicki Krause said. "This is in addition to the scheduled MMR vaccinations at 12 and 18 months, so babies who are vaccinated early will require a total of 3 doses."

Most cases in this outbreak have been in adults. If you are not immune from measles, you are at risk of getting the disease and of transmitting it to others. Measles is a very contagious viral illness that is spread among people through coughing and sneezing.

For babies under 9 months who are not recommended for vaccination, the CDC recommends the "herd immunity" approach to protecting vulnerable people by ensuring those who spend time with them are appropriately immunised, and also recommend minimising unnecessary public outings with their young babies at this time.

CDC staff have been contacting people, now well over 1000 in total, who have been identified as having contact with measles cases to provide information and offer preventive immunisation as appropriate.

Two babies, aged 8 and 11 months, have been infected in a rare outbreak of measles in Australia as the highly contagious disease makes a comeback in East Asia and the Pacific.

Health authorities in New South Wales state said the infants likely caught the disease in public places.

They are too young to be vaccinated, Vicky Sheppeard, NSW Health's director of communicable diseases, told CNN. The standard vaccination schedule in Australia starts at 12 months. Infants lose their maternal immunity by about 6 months of age, so are vulnerable for around another 6 months.

Sheppeard told CNN that people who do not realize they are unvaccinated -- those born after a national vaccination program began in 1966 but before a national registry was established -- can pose a problem since their families may have missed "one or 2 doses" in the program.

[14] The true dollar cost of the anti-vaccine movement
Date: Sun 31 Mar 2019
Source: Ars Technica [abridged, edited]
https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/03/the-true-dollar-cost-of-the-anti-vaccine-movement/?comments=1&start=40


When we talk about vaccines, we tend to talk about the clinical impact of refusing them, the potentially deadly danger that vaccine-preventable diseases pose to the unvaccinated or the immunocompromised when herd immunity breaks down. Every grave illness and death is an individual tragedy, but the cost of vaccine hesitancy also enforces a shared public toll.

Consider the ongoing measles outbreak in Washington State, which is centered in Clark County, on the Oregon border. In January 2019, when it had racked up 26 cases, the state governor declared a public health emergency. Since then, the case count has almost tripled, to 74.

To figure out who might have been put at risk, the state health department has interviewed 4652 people and closely monitored 812 of them. It has reassigned staff from across its divisions, borrowed public health workers from other states, sent people who would normally be at desks out into the field, performed hundreds of lab tests that would not normally be necessary. So far, it has spent USD 1.6 million.

"It is extremely frustrating," says John Wiesman, an epidemiologist and the state secretary of health. "To know the financial cost of this but also to know all the work that is not getting done, or getting backlogged."

In coverage of the dangers of vaccine hesitancy, cost doesn't get discussed much. But it's not unusual for a preventable disease outbreak to rack up a bill as high as Washington's.

In 2005, a 17-year-old girl whose family belonged to a church that discouraged vaccination went on a mission trip to Europe. The day after the group arrived home, the church threw a party; 34 attendees caught measles from the teen or from someone she infected. Not including medical care, containing that outbreak cost USD 167 685. When they analyzed the spending, the CDC and the state health department calculated it had taken 3650 work hours, 4800 phone calls, and 5500 miles of car trips to track the victims down. In 2008, an unvaccinated infected traveler brought measles to a hospital in Tucson; the cost of containing the outbreak, which spread to a 2nd hospital, was almost USD 800 000.

The numbers can grow much bigger still. Researchers at the CDC estimated that handling 107 cases of measles that occurred in 2011 cost state and local health departments between USD 2.7 million and USD 5.3 million. In 2014, 42 people came down with the disease after passing through Disneyland at the same time as a never-identified person with measles and subsequently infected 90 additional people in California, 14 more in other states, and a further 159 people in Canada. The cost of controlling the outbreak, just in California, totaled almost USD 4 million. And in 2017, a 5-month outbreak of measles in Minnesota infected 79 people and cost the state USD 2.3 million.

The funding to support that work isn't being conjured out of the air. It's coming from the budgets of public agencies, which have already been facing years of cuts and have no secret stashes of discretionary money to spend.

"There are substantial public health responses that go into mitigating an outbreak, and we should pursue those, because they prevent larger outbreaks or broader social disruption," says Saad Omer, a physician and epidemiologist at Emory University and the senior author of a recent paper on the "true cost" of measles outbreaks. "But it does result in a lot of costs that can be pretty substantial. And we don't measure the further indirect costs to the community."

In Washington State, those indirect costs include the other work that doesn't get done while the outbreak proceeds. The state health department was forced to appropriate a portion of its poison control center's work hours to handle the calls made by people worried they had been exposed to measles. In Clark County, the local health department reassigned to measles the home-visit nurses who take care of risky pregnancies, and also the investigators who track down victims of sexually transmitted diseases and foodborne illnesses.

Most of the havoc wreaked by outbreaks of otherwise preventable diseases can only be measured qualitatively: a parent's terror; a child's loss of weeks at school; a neighborhood or city's frayed social bonds (In Clark County, Wiesman says, "People are staying home, afraid to go out, cancelling birthday parties.").

But we can quantify the medical and public health response. It is the bottom lines on hospital bills, for medical care that would not otherwise have been necessary. (In the tetanus case, the hospital has declined to say whether the parents or their insurance will pay, or whether the hospital will eat the cost as charity care.) It's lab work that was never budgeted for, hotel charges and gas for investigators sent out on the road, overtime hours for state police rushing emergency doses of immunotherapy across the state.

Those costs are being paid by state governments and by federal agencies such as the CDC that give states grants and loan them personnel. State and federal budgets are public money, which means those necessary bills for unnecessary outbreaks are being paid by all of us. The toll of illness may be confined to individuals, but the cost of responding to outbreaks related to vaccine refusal is a bill that we are all being compelled to pay.

[15] USA - Anti-vaxxer named and shamed by concerned mums in neighbourhood

A group of mums in the US have named and shamed their anti-vax neighbour, amid a measles outbreak affecting dozens of states across the country.

The Wisconsin parents penned a letter warning other residents that a local woman "does not believe in vaccinating herself or her family," putting many people in the community at risk.

"This puts anyone at risk if they are medically fragile, immunocompromised, or out of date in their vaccinations," the letter reads. "Please use caution when sharing work or personal space with this individual, eating foods prepared by this individual, or attending gatherings at this individual's house if you or the people who are important to you fall into medically at-risk categories."

Individuals who aren't vaccinated can easily spread diseases like measles to people who are immune-compromised or can't be vaccinated, such as the elderly, patients undergoing chemotherapy, and babies.

The letter addresses this risk, as well as pointing out how the growing anti-vax movement has helped the resurgence of diseases including measles.

People who are unvaccinated have caused outbreaks in Arkansas, Oregon Washington, California, New York, North Carolina, Michigan, Virginia, Texas, Kansas, Illinois, Kentucky, Florida, Minnesota, Colorado, and Pennsylvania, with more outbreaks expected," the letter reads.

"Nearly all outbreaks of disease were started by unvaccinated individuals, who pass along vaccine-preventable diseases to those without adequate protection."

[This is rather severe treatment that likely will make the individual targets of the campaign even more recalcitrant and determined to band together with like-minded allies. Perhaps testimony in community meetings, from families who have had children infected with measles, might be more persuasive. - Mod LK]
