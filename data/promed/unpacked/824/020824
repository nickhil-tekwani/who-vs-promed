A Bernalillo County, New Mexico woman's death is the state's 1st death from
the plague in more than a decade. The woman died early last week of bubonic
plague, the bacterium of which many historians blame for the Black Death
that killed more than a million people in Europe during the mid-14th century.
Bubonic plague is usually transmitted to humans through the bites of
infected fleas but also can be transmitted through infected pets or other
animals. Symptoms of the plague include fever; painful, swollen lymph nodes
in the groin, armpit and neck [these very painful lymph gland swellings are
called buboes - Mod.LL]; and chills.
Dr. Paul Ettestad, the state's public health veterinarian, says Bernalillo
County and other north-central New Mexico counties had increased plague
activity this year [2006]. Plague peaks during the warmer months, so
Ettestad says it's very important to avoid rodents and fleas now.
Four people in New Mexico were infected with the plague in 2005. The last
death from plague was 12 years ago, when a child in Rio Arriba County died
of the disease.

[Bubonic plague is the classical form of _Yersinia pestis_ infection,
representing 85-90 percent of clinical presentations. Individuals present
with fever, chills, headache and the painful bubo. The process arises as a
result of a bite from an infected flea or by contamination of an open skin
lesion. Local bacterial proliferation is sometimes evident (4-10 percent of
cases) in the form of an abscess or ulcer at the site of infection (1).
Symptoms of fever and malaise develop 2-6 days after exposure. The bubo
generally occurs in the groin lymph nodes (90 percent), more commonly in
the femoral than inguinal nodes. Axillary and cervical lymph nodes may be
involved reflective of the location of the fleabite. Usually heralded by
very severe pain within 6-8 hours after the onset of constitutional
symptoms, the bubo becomes evident within 24 hours. It has been said (1)
that the bubo may be so tender that semicomatose patients will posture in a
way to attempt to decrease pressure on the swelling. The bubo may not be
evident in the 1st few days of symptoms. Furthermore, involvement of deeper
lymph nodes may not be visible. In these cases, abdominal pain suggestive
of appendicitis, colitis, enteritis or cholecystitis may be described. In
such cases, tenderness upon abdominal palpitation will be misleading and
may result in hazardous exploratory surgery and a potentially lethal delay
in specific antimicrobial therapy.
The mechanism of transmission of plague from flea to mammalian host is as
follows:
Fleas become infected upon feeding on the blood of a rodent suffering from
bacteremic infection. The bacteria are restricted to the alimentary tract
of the flea, where they multiply in the midgut. The bacteria may form large
brown clumps that extend throughout the midgut, esophagus and
proventriculus, a valve-like chamber situated between the esophagus and the
midgut. The clumps increase in mass over a few days until the
proventriculus is blocked.
The "blocked" flea then feeds on blood, but the meal is unable to pass into
the stomach. The flea continues to attempt to feed, but as it futilely
sucks blood from the host, the blood meal, mixed with bacteria from the
foregut, is regurgitated into the mammal. As many as 24 000 bacilli may be
transmitted in a single attempted feeding (2).
Deaths from plague are generally related to spread of the bacilli from the
infected bubo into the blood stream with septicemia and dropping blood
pressure. The septicemia can spread to the lungs causing a secondary plague
pneumonia. It is this form that can spread from person-to-person. The
manifestations of _Y. pestis_ infection in this case is not stated.
