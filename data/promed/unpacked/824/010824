An 8-month-old baby is the latest patient to test positive for avian
influenza in Indonesia. Doctors believe the baby may have caught the
disease from an infected pigeon. A spokesman at the Sulianti Soroso
hospital in Jakarta says preliminary tests, yet to be confirmed by the
World Health Organisation in Hong Kong, show that the child is suffering
from the H5N1 strain of avian influenza. Our correspondent in Indonesia,
Peter Cave, says the infant was put into an isolation ward at the
designated avian influenza centre on Sun 4 Dec 2005, 5 days after
contracting a high fever at his home in North Jakarta.
6 other patients are undergoing tests at the hospital. While the official
[human] death toll from avian influenza in Indonesia stands at 8, some
experts believe that because of poor surveillance and reporting the number
has been underestimated. Nearly 70 people in 5 Asian countries have died
from bird flu since late 2003.
Scientists warn that contact between infected birds and humans could lead
to the virus mutating into a form that easily passes between humans,
sparking a pandemic that could kill millions.

[The total number of laboratory-confirmed human cases of avian influenza
virus infection in Indonesia is 13, 8 with fatal outcomes. If the infection
in the 8-month-old baby is confirmed, the total number of avian influenza
Indonesia will become 14, and the total number of cases throughout East
Asian since December 2003 will become 135. - Mod.CP]
