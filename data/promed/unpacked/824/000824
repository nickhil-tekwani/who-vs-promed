The United States experienced typical low levels of seasonal influenza activity. Influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 (pH1N1), influenza A (H3N2), and influenza B viruses were detected worldwide and were identified sporadically in the United States. All of the influenza viruses collected from U.S. states and other countries during that time have been characterized antigenically and/or genetically as being similar to the influenza vaccine viruses recommended for inclusion in the 2015-16 Northern Hemisphere vaccine. During 24 May-5 Sep 2015, 3 influenza variant virus infections were reported; one influenza A (H3N2) variant virus (H3N2v) from Minnesota in July 2015, one influenza A (H1N1) variant (H1N1v) from Iowa in August 2015, and one H3N2v from Michigan in August 2015.

United States
-------------
The U.S. influenza surveillance system is a collaboration between CDC and federal, state, local, and territorial partners and uses 8 data sources to collect influenza information, 6 of which operate year-round.

During 24 May-5 Sep 2015, World Health Organization (WHO) and National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS) collaborating laboratories in the United States tested 80 345 specimens for influenza; 698 (2.1 percent) were positive for influenza . Of the 1698 specimens positive for influenza during the summer months of 2015, a total of 913 (54 percent) were influenza A viruses, and 785 (46 percent) were influenza B viruses. Influenza B viruses were reported slightly more frequently than influenza A viruses from late May until mid-June 2015, and influenza A viruses were more commonly reported from late June through early September 2015. Of the 913 influenza A viruses, 551 (60 percent) were subtyped: 28 (5 percent) were pH1N1 viruses and 523 (95 percent) were influenza A (H3N2) viruses. Influenza viruses were reported from the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and 47 states in all 10 U.S. Department of Health and Human Services regions.

During 24 May-5 Sep 2015, data from the U.S. Outpatient Influenza-Like Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet) indicated that the weekly percentage of outpatient visits to health care providers for influenza-like illness (ILI) remained below the national baseline of 2.0 percent, ranging from 0.8 percent to 1.3 percent. The percentage of deaths attributed to pneumonia and influenza (P&I), as reported by the 122 Cities Mortality Reporting System, did not exceed the epidemic threshold for 2 consecutive weeks and ranged from 5.0 percent to 6.4 percent. A total of 4 influenza-associated pediatric deaths were reported during 24 May-5 Sep 2015; all were associated with influenza B viruses and occurred during weeks 7, 8, 17, and 21 (the weeks ending 21 & 28 Feb 2015, 2 & 30 May 2015, respectively).

Novel Influenza A Virus Infection
----------------------------
During 24 May-5 Sep 2015, 3 cases of human infection with novel influenza A viruses were reported. One infection with an H3N2v virus was reported by Minnesota in July 2015; one infection with an H1N1v virus was reported by Iowa in August 2015, and one infection with an H3N2v virus was reported by Michigan in August 2015. All 3 patients were hospitalized as a result of their illness, but recovered fully. Direct contact with swine in the week preceding illness onset was reported in all 3 instances. No ongoing community transmission of either virus was detected.

Worldwide
--------
CDC serves as a WHO Collaborating Center for Surveillance, Epidemiology, and Control of Influenza, one of 6 WHO Collaborating Centers for Influenza in the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS) (1). CDC, along with other international public health partners, provide surveillance and virus characterization data to WHO. The timing of influenza activity around the world varies depending on the climate of the region. Geographic groups of countries, areas, or territories with similar influenza transmission patterns are grouped by influenza transmission zones.

During 24 May-5 Sep 2015, typical seasonal patterns of influenza activity occurred in temperate climate Southern Hemisphere countries. In Australia, influenza activity began to increase in early June 2015, while influenza activity in New Zealand began to increase in mid-July 2015. Activity in both countries remained elevated as of early September 2015. In Australia and New Zealand, influenza B viruses predominated overall, but the proportion of influenza A (H3N2) viruses increased during July and August 2015. Small numbers of pH1N1 viruses were reported from both countries. In South Africa, influenza activity began to increase in late May 2015, peaked in late June 2015, and decreased in late July 2015. Influenza A (H3N2) and pH1N1 viruses predominated in that country, but influenza B viruses also were reported. In temperate countries of South America, influenza activity began to increase in June 2015, remained elevated through July 2015, and decreased in August 2015. Influenza A viruses were reported more frequently than influenza B viruses, and both pH1N1 and influenza A (H3N2) viruses were detected in Chile and Paraguay. Influenza A (H3N2) viruses predominated in Argentina. In temperate climate countries of Europe and North America, influenza activity was low, and small numbers of pH1N1, influenza A (H3N2), and influenza B viruses were identified.

In countries with tropical influenza seasonality, overall influenza activity remained low, and the predominant virus varied by country. In the Caribbean and Central America, influenza A viruses were more commonly reported, with influenza A (H3N2) viruses predominating in Mexico and El Salvador, while pH1N1 viruses were more frequently reported in Cuba. In tropical South America, influenza A viruses predominated. Influenza A (H3N2) and pH1N1 viruses co-circulated in Colombia and Peru, while influenza A (H3N2) viruses predominated in Brazil and Ecuador; however, influenza B viruses were more frequently reported in Bolivia. In South Asia and Southeast Asia, a decrease in influenza activity was observed during August and September 2015, and influenza A (H3N2) viruses predominated in Cambodia, China, Laos, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Viet Nam, with smaller numbers of pH1N1 and influenza B viruses reported. In Indonesia, influenza B viruses were more frequently reported, but influenza A (H3N2) and pH1N1 viruses also were identified. During 24 May-5 Sep 2015, 4 laboratory-confirmed human cases of avian influenza A (H5N1) virus infections were reported to WHO from Egypt, and one case of influenza A (H5N6) and 5 cases of influenza A (H7N9) were identified in China.

Characterization of Influenza Viruses
------------------------------
The components for the 2015-16 Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccines were selected in February 2015 during the twice-yearly WHO-sponsored vaccine consultation meeting to review data generated by GISRS laboratories. The recommended Northern Hemisphere 2015-16 vaccine composition was the same as was recommended for the 2015 Southern Hemisphere and included an A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus, an A/Switzerland/9715293/2013 (H3N2)-like virus, and a B/Phuket/3073/2013-like (B/Yamagata lineage) virus for trivalent influenza vaccines. An additional influenza B virus (B/Brisbane/60/2008-like [B/Victoria lineage]) was recommended for quadrivalent vaccines.

Influenza viruses used to produce most influenza vaccines in the United States must be grown in eggs per current regulatory requirements. However, egg propagation of influenza viruses, and influenza A (H3N2) viruses in particular, can lead to genetic changes that might have antigenic implications. The vaccine viruses selected for the Northern Hemisphere 2015-16 vaccine were representative of most, but not all circulating influenza viruses at that time, and had the fewest and least significant egg-adapted changes.

The WHO Collaborating Center for Surveillance, Epidemiology, and Control of Influenza, located at CDC, receives and characterizes influenza virus isolates from laboratories worldwide. CDC and other collaborating centers routinely use hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assays to antigenically characterize influenza viruses to compare how similar currently circulating influenza viruses are to those included in the influenza vaccine, and to monitor for changes in circulating influenza viruses. Beginning in the 2014-15 season and to date, however, a portion of influenza A (H3N2) viruses did not yield sufficient hemagglutination titers for antigenic characterization by HI. For many of these viruses, CDC performed genetic characterization which provided the genetic group identity of circulating viruses. In this way, antigenic properties of these viruses can be inferred from viruses within the same genetic group that have been characterized antigenically.

During 24 May-5 Sep 2015, a total of 199 viruses collected from the United States and worldwide were antigenically and/or genetically characterized by CDC, including 20 influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 viruses, 118 influenza A (H3N2) viruses, and 61 influenza B viruses.

All 20 (100 percent) influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 viruses (16 international and 4 U.S.) were antigenically similar to the A/California/7/2009, the influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 vaccine component. Of the 118 influenza A (H3N2) viruses characterized (31 international and 87 U.S.), all 118 (100 percent) were antigenically similar to A/Switzerland/9715293/2013, or belonged to a genetic group for which a majority of antigenically characterized viruses were similar to the A/Switzerland/9715293/2013 vaccine component.

Of the 61 influenza B viruses collected and analyzed (11 international and 50 U.S.), 35 (57 percent) belonged to the B/Yamagata lineage, and all 35 (100 percent) of these were antigenically similar to the B/Phuket/3073/2013 virus, the influenza B component for both the 2015-16 Northern Hemisphere trivalent and quadrivalent vaccines. The remaining 26 viruses (43 percent) belonged to the B/Victoria lineage and were antigenically similar to the B/Brisbane/60/2008 virus, the B/Victoria lineage component of the 2015-16 Northern Hemisphere quadrivalent influenza vaccine.

Antiviral Resistance Profiles of Influenza Virus Isolates
----------------------------------
The WHO Collaborating Center for Surveillance, Epidemiology, and Control of Influenza at CDC tested 169 influenza virus specimens collected during 24 May-5 Sep 2015 from the U.S. and worldwide for resistance to the influenza neuraminidase inhibitor antiviral medications; oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir, which are the drugs currently approved for use against seasonal influenza. All 19 (16 international and 3 U.S.) pH1N1 viruses, 84 (5 international and 79 U.S.) influenza A (H3N2) viruses, and 66 (11 international and 55 U.S) influenza B viruses tested were sensitive to all 3 antiviral medications. High levels of resistance to the adamantanes (amantadine and rimantadine) persist among pH1N1 and influenza A (H3N2) viruses. Adamantane drugs are not recommended for use against influenza at this time.

Discussion
--------------
During 24 May-5 Sep 2015, pH1N1, influenza A (H3N2), and influenza B viruses co-circulated worldwide. In the United States, low levels of influenza activity were reported, and influenza A viruses were more frequently reported from late June to September 2015. All of the influenza viruses collected from U.S. states and other countries during that time were antigenically and/or genetically characterized as being similar to the influenza vaccine viruses recommended for inclusion in the 2015-16 Northern Hemisphere vaccine.

Antigenic and genetic characterization of circulating influenza viruses can give an indication of the influenza vaccine's ability to produce an immune response against circulating influenza viruses, but vaccine effectiveness studies are needed to determine how much protection has been provided by vaccination to the community.

Last season, low vaccine effectiveness observed against the predominant influenza A (H3N2) viruses was consistent with laboratory data indicating that most influenza A (H3N2) viruses that circulated were antigenically and genetically different (drifted) from the influenza A (H3N2) vaccine component of the 2014-15 Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccines

(It is not possible to predict which influenza virus will predominate or how severe influenza-related disease activity will be during the 2015-16 season, nor is it possible to say with certainty how effective influenza vaccine will be; however, laboratory analysis of influenza viruses to date suggests that the majority of viruses circulating worldwide in the past few months are similar to 2015-16 vaccine viruses.

Annual influenza vaccination is the best method for preventing influenza and its potentially severe complications. While vaccine effectiveness can vary, vaccination has been shown to reduce influenza illnesses, doctors' visits, influenza-related hospitalizations, and deaths. Even during seasons when vaccine effectiveness is reduced, substantial public health impact can still be measured. In the United States, annual influenza vaccination is recommended for all persons aged greater than or equal to 6 months who do not have contraindications. Annual influenza vaccination is recommended regardless of whether the vaccine composition has changed because immunity from vaccination might wane after one season.

For the 2015-16 influenza season, interim supply projections by manufacturers for the U.S. market range from 171 million and 179 million doses of vaccine. This would to be the largest supply of influenza vaccine distributed in the United States during one season with the exception of the 2009 pandemic.

Multiple influenza vaccines are approved for use and are being distributed during the 2015-16 season, including a quadrivalent live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV4), trivalent and quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccines (IIV3 and IIV4, respectively), a trivalent cell culture-based inactivated influenza vaccine (ccIIV3), a high-dose trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (hd IIV3), and a recombinant trivalent influenza vaccine (RIV3). One IIV4 formulation also is approved for intradermal administration. Although both LAIV and inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) have been demonstrated to be effective in children and adults, LAIV is approved for use in persons aged 2 through 49 years with no contraindications or precautions (3). For the 2015-16 season, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommended that healthy children aged 2 through 8 years who have no contraindications or precautions receive either LAIV or IIV, with no preference expressed for either vaccine when one is otherwise appropriate and available. This removes the 2014-15 preferential recommendation of LAIV for healthy children aged 2 through 8 years. For the 2015-16 season, ACIP recommends that children aged 6 months through 8 years who have previously received greater than or equal to 2 total doses of trivalent or quadrivalent influenza vaccine at any time before 1 Jul 2015, require only one dose for 2015-16. The 2 previous doses do not need to have been given during the same or consecutive seasons (3). Children in this age group who are being vaccinated for the 1st time or who have not previously received a total of greater than or equal to 2 doses require 2 doses of influenza vaccine, administered greater than or equal to 4 weeks apart (9).

[Influenza viruses that circulate in swine are called swine influenza viruses when isolated from swine but are called variant influenza viruses when isolated from humans. Seasonal influenza viruses that circulate worldwide in the human population have important antigenic and genetic differences from influenza viruses circulating in swine.
