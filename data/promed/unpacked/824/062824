I believe (from a posting by J Ralph - so it must be true :-) ) that there
is evidence linking warble fly and BSE distribution. This has been used as
circumstantial evidence of a connection with the OPs used to treat the warble
fly.

Given that a link between warble fly and BSE exists, can anybody explain how
the warble fly itself has been eliminated as a carrier of BSE ? A bit of
background on the life cycle of the fly would also be appreciated.

I did not say that,. Of such misunderstandings are myths born.

What I did say -- it seems like a lifetime ago but actually only a few
months ago, in answer to a query about Mark Purdey, that Dr Douglas
Latto had stated that Mark Purdey had claimed to correlate the
geographical locations of heaviest BSE incidence with the locations of
heaviest incidence of warble fly.

The warble fly is similar to the screw fly of America. It lays its eggs
on the legs of cattle. When they hatch they burrow under the skin and
deep into the body and munch their way (over a year) through the cows
body until they are just under the skin over the spine. Eventually they
chew their way out and drop to the ground, a legless grub about (from
memory) 25+mm x 10mm. They then pupate and hatch on the ground.

There was a suggestion that BSE was directly caused by the once annual
treatment against this pest when the UK effectively eradicated it.

Despite [] protestations to the contrary the case against this proposal
is pretty solid. I will offer some examples.

1) The effective eradication was complete by 1981. Small areas in
certain counties have been given treatment orders since then. The usual
area is 3km radius from the farm where the case occurred.

2) So the vast majority of dairy cows who went down with BSE who were
born typically 1983 to 1987 were never treated with a warblicide.

3) OP's are used on cattle the continent, America, Australia and many
other places without BSE appearing. Indeed in hot climates they may be
used several times a year. The amount of pour-on OP's used on the
continent was many, many, times greater than the UK 82-90 since the UK
rarely identified more than the low hundreds per annum in these years
(except for the odd batch of imported cattle). Why has BSE not appeared
in these other places?

4) BSE can be easily experimentally transferred by injection of prions.
It has never appeared in any trials of OP's, nor in any animals treated
outside of the UK.

5) To my personal knowledge of three herds that have had BSE NONE of
these cattle had ever been treated with a warblicide, even in utero.

6) Politically it would be nice to blame it on OP's, a simple ban on
OP's should stop the problem in it's tracks. The fact is that this is a
dangerous illusion not born out by the facts.

Most interesting proposition about warble fly. Is UK _still_ requiring
Phosmet spraying? Spraying started in 1981 but infection didn't peak until
1988. Did Phosmet have any actual impact at the time on warble fly
infestation level?

Recall that hay mites, injected intra-cranially into mice, reportedly
transmitted scrapie. I have not seen a follow-up to the Apr 19, 1996
letter to Lancet. In particular, have not seen anything with hay mites
transmitting BSE. See below:



'Mad cow' disease could be spread by hay mites:
April 19, 1996 letter to Lancet medical journal:

LONDON (Apr 19, 1996 10:24 p.m. EDT) -- The hay mite, a
common field insect, could be responsible for transmitting infectious
proteins that may cause "mad cow" disease, scientists said.
[Lancet 1996;347:114]
[snip]
After isolating hay mites, Henryk Wisniewski, of the New York State
Institute for Basic Research in Developmental Disabilities, and colleagues
in New York and Iceland injected particles of the insects into mice. The
mice then came down with scrapie, the scientists said in a letter to the
magazine.
"It is possible that hay mites ... have played a part in the continuing
occurrence of BSE in the U.K.," Wisniewski said.

[-Wisniewski & colleagues injected 71 mice intracerebrally (37) &
intraperitoneally (34) with hay mites of various species from five Icelandic

Subject: Re: Warble fly


It was the peculiar geographical distribution of BSE in the UK which made
Mark Purdey put forward the hypothesis, that warblecide could be involved
in the causation of BSE. Obviously a comparison of the epidemiological
features in time and space of BSE with the timing and geographical
distribution of warblecide treatments would be the most promising
possibility to disprove Mark Purdey's hypothesis.

In one of the initial epidemiological studies on BSE (Vet Rec 1988 123,
663-644), Wilesmith et al. specifically state the range of pharmaceutica
examined, and excluded as common factors. "These included the use of
vaccines, hormones, organophosphorous fly sprays, synthetic pyrethroid
sprays and ear tags and anthelminthics".
Also on-farm use of herbicides and pesticides were examined and excluded.
Warblecide pour-on treatments are not mentioned in the 1988 Wilesmith et
al. study.

The necessity for excluding these factors stems from the epidemiological
features of the disease which are compatible with a causative agent
spread by human intervention, like foodstuffs, medical treatments or
agrochemicals. At the time of the initial study the association between
the time of onset of clinical symptoms and calendar month or stage of
pregnancy could not be perceived. An association would be expected if
medical treatments or agrochemicals were involved. The apparent lack of
any association contributed to the selection of the working hypothesis
that the causative agent is spread with feedstuffs. This hypothesis has
guided research ever since.

The seasonal variation became apparent and was noted by Wilesmith et.al
(Vet.Rec. 1992, 130 90-94) "the apparent seasonal variations .. are being
studied in relation to the potential seasonality of exposure, given the
seasonality of calving and the feeding of calves with concentrate rations."

This seems to suggest that seasonal exposure (to calves) were responsible.

On this list it has been suggested that the seasonality of farming practices,
housing, calving and opportunities for inspecting could explain the
seasonality. This may well be the true cause.
The seasonality is clearly present, the ratio between numbers of clinical
onset at maximum (Dec-Jan) and minimum (May-Jun) is appr. 1.3.

Ok, this was a spin-off from the above. Back to the track.
WARBLECIDE HYPOTHESIS

The strongest disproof of this hypothesis would be inconsistency between
which cows (or unborn calves) were exposed to warblecide, and which cows
contracted the disease. Warblecide treatments are given in the autumn
(August AFAIK) when the adult warble fly has stopped propagating eggs. The
treatment cannot be delayed much, because the larvae in November-December
reach the spinal cord, and treatment at this stage can lead to serious
fatal adverse reaction [sic] to larvae dying in the vertebral canal.

Treatments with warblecide thus coincide with or slightly predecease the
peak calving season (August-October) in the UK. Although treatment of
pregnant and dairy cows with OP's are generally not recommendable, they do
not seem to have been excempted from treatment in the UK warble eradication
campaign 1978-81 and in the following years.

In the discussion with Oz on sci.agriculture, he initially categorically
stated that no warble-treatment had been used since 1981 in the UK.
It has been a hot battle, and Oz now qualifies his words like this:

>1) The effective eradication was complete by 1981. Small areas in
>certain counties have been given treatment orders since then. The usual
>area is 3km radius from the farm where the case occurred.

Oz does not recognize that voluntary treatments commenced, presumably
to the largest extent in regions which were still warble-infested
in the late eigthies. In a previous post I have quoted the MAFF 1989
surveillance report which indeed recognized that voluntary treatments were
used in prophylaxis, and have probably been a key factor in the virtual
eradication of warbles in most areas of UK by 1990. Experience from
eradication campaigns in Ireland shows, that infestation with warbles may
spread quickly a few years after a successful campaign, unless prophylactic
treatments are continued. The OP treatments that were employed in the
late eighties were predominantly phosmet treatments -- other OP's (mainly
fenthion) were used during the compulsory eradication campaign 1978-1981.

The MAFF 1989 surveillance report mentions the widespread use of ivermectin
anthelminthics as a contributing factor. Ivermectin is also warblecidal.
(as a sidebar: serious adverse drug experiences with ivermectin are not
uncommon, and the drug has teratogenic properties -- Ivermectin should be
looked at very carefully in order to exclude it as a contributing factor
to BSE, if this has not been done already)

>2) So the vast majority of dairy cows who went down with BSE who were
>born typically 1983 to 1987 were never treated with a warblicide.

This is not correct. The large majority of BSE-cases were born in the
1986-1988 calving seasons. *Maybe* the cases in these cohorts were not
treated with warblecidal products. If this can be demonstrated, I have
reached my goal: the exclusion of warblecides as causative agent for BSE.

A BBC-broadcast and Ralph Lucas have made reference to a study with this
conclusion. There does not seem to be any published studies. I have
prompted Ralph Lucas twice in private e-mail and once here on the list for
a reference, until now with no success. It could be *the* key piece of
evidence to devastate the warblecide hypothesis. If warblecide treatments
are involved at all, I would suggest, that exposure in utero (last
trimester) or in early calfhood is the most likely timing scenario. If this
is not recognized by the (hypothetical) study or trial, they are of limited
value.

Although some evidence to the exclusion of warblecides as causative agent
could be gained from such observations it would be weak compared to the one
above. There is a range of uncertainties as to timing, products or batches
used, the sort of cattle treated (dairy vs. beef), the degree of veterinary
surveillance.

>4) BSE can be easily experimentally transferred by injection of prions.

BSE was not transferred to the British cows by injection of prions!
At least something we know with high certainty.
Experiments with oral exposure with M&B meal have AFAIK not been done (and
they would be impractical due to the large number of animals needed if
unequivocal results should be obtained)

And trials with OP's have the same weakness + more.

>5) To my personal knowledge of three herds that have had BSE NONE of

Ok. You may have one (or is it two?) BSE cases which were not exposed to
warblecide and you heard of two other similar occurrences. I would prefer
a proper study, though. If such observations were enough, the M&B meal
hypothesis is endangered too, as there are observations of BSE in herds
that were not exposed to bought in feed-stuffs.

[snip]

If, I repeat: if, a *specific OP treatment* is involved in the
occurrence of BSE, it would be a dangerous illusion to be unaware of it.

I am looking for facts that can kill this possibility. I would even welcome
them.

I came across an old posting of mine. I thought it might be appropriate
here. Note that compulsory treatment of all UK herds ceased in 1981. The
number treated under local compusory areas has been tiny since then.

=========================

sci.agriculture 9th May 1996.

Chief Vet Officer's Report 1981 (UK) stated:

A large scale survey showed in 1978 that 20% of cattle in the UK had had
an infection of warble fly.

I have been able to obtain the following information from MAFF:

Warble fly compulsory treatment zones were for farms within a 3km radius
of an infected farm. So a zone in Oxfordshire would not be some huge
area, but a very small local zone of 3km radius.

The number of farms that were placed under order in 1982 was 1589. Areas
that had a broad sprinkling of cases were zoned so as to cover the whole
area (so some of these could have been a significant part of a county.
There were four such zones.

I have only been able to get the number of British cattle infected since
1985, and two infected importations. Note that this is out of a total
cattle population of about 12M. They are as follows:

Year No of indigenous UK cattle infected
85 419 3.5 per 100,000 cattle
86 34 2.8 per million cattle
87 8 0.7 per million cattle
88 4 0.3 per million cattle
89 2 0.17 per million cattle
90-95 1 (total) essentially nil.

Two outbreaks of infection in imported cattle comprising:
1993 207 cases
1992 43 cases

The ministry man who gave me the information thought that these were the
major cases of imported warble infection. There may have been odd other
isolated cases, but he couldn't find any further information.

As to other EC countries I have been able to find the following
information:

Recent survey from Germany (where it is apparently the law that infected
cattle should be treated) in Rheinland gave 30% of herds infected with
warbles. In France any herd with more than 5% warbles are by law obliged
to treat the whole herd. Apparently this is done by Department and 'some
police this more than others'.

So it is quite clear that treatment for warbles is not confined to the
UK in the three years of the eradication scheme. There were, and are,
very significant usages of these products in the continental EC which
continue to this day. At least some countries have laws requiring
treatment, and I would expect the majority of welfare conscious farmers
would treat anyway. The minority who don't spreading the problem to
those that do.

One should also note that only one product can be used on milking cows
with an acceptable milk withdrawal period (I believe Phorate), which is
indeed an OP. Ivermectin is rather persistent, so cannot practicably be
used on dairy cows.

The BSE and OP so-called link is thus dealt yet another blow. As I said
before, it is a farce anyway. All the evidence is against it, heavily so
at that.

Mostly Phosmet wasn't used except in areas with lots of mites, typocally
upland areas. About 1/3 of the country used Tiguvon for example.

Yes, it eradicated the disease. We (for example) have not treated any
cattle with insecticides since 1981, this would be typical of the
majority of farmers. [de Baer is a farmer. MHJ]

I'll bet this turns out to be completely irrelevant in the fullness of
time. Beware, mosquitoes will be implicated next. I note that this work
doesn't seem to have been repeated, perhaps we will know in a few years
time. Incidentally the work came from a research group in Iceland.

I believe someone chucked you some more wobblies.

The serological surveillance method was published in 1983 and it was used in
the UK at least as late as 1992. If indeed the surveillance has been
discontinued, it must have happened very recently.

Positive results are scrupulously verified in the lab and in the field in
these surveys. Your vets (and a lot of other people involved) have done a
damned fine job with the warble surveillance, if you ask me.

The numbers of animals infected / tested were
1988: 29 / 74,502
1989: 39 / 152,434

Seems to me that any grub that makes its way near/into the spinal column
would be a good way (200000x better than oral route) to innoculate
CSF/CNS with prions. What are realistic estimates for % of cattle
actually infested with warbles? Are there already studies/data which

having BSE?

The warble larvae come from eggs, which the warble fly positions in the fur
of the cow (low on it's legs). The eggs hatch and the small larvae then
crawl to the skin, enters the animal, and munches it's way to the spinal
cord/vertebral canal.

So I think your question should be rephrased: How would warble
flies get the prions to put into its eggs? And if it could,
why should it put prions in it's eggs?

I am afraid that a theory that BSE was transmitted along this route
runs into more difficulties.

The infestation of British cows with warbles in the critical period
has been at a level much too low to be consistent with warble-spread BSE,
and the rapid disease spreading is not consistent either. How could
warble flies suddenly spread the disease over large areas of UK?
They are definitely not long-distance fliers :-)

What remains is the possibility that warble larvae (eggs) was a
minor contributing vector. Impossible is such an absolute word. I find
it highly unlikely.

Well it would be a brilliant suggestion were it not for the fact that
warbles in the UK are essentially eradicated. This is most certainly NOT
the case in most of the EU. On top of that (as I have said before)
warbles was effectively eradicated before 1981.

Also please not that the big, heavy and poor flying warble fly itself
has a range of only about 1km.

I am really posting for another reason. This afternoon I had a phone
call from a large farmer in S England who I worked for as manager over
20 years ago, we speak every couple of years. Since he has 500 cows on
his farm I asked him how many cases of BSE he had had. None, but then I
had forgotten that he produced his own feedstuffs in his own mill. I
asked him if he had used warblicide 79-81 and the answer was 'of course,
and before then'. Now a 500 cow trial may not be big enough for Torsten,
but he kept an awful lot of animals to 10+ lactations at that time.
Anyway I can now point to a total of four herds with 1000 cows total,
probably amounting to around 2000+ cows over ten years where none of the
animals treated with warblicide ever contracted the disease.

Even if others did.

Can we put that one to bed yet? At least for the moment.
