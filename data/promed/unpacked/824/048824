[Between August and December 2019, 7 outbreaks of FMD-SAT 3 were reported in cattle in the Zambezi region. The event was declared resolved in February 2020. The source of infection was due to contact with wild animals. See a summary and updated map of this event at https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?reportid=31416.

According to the media report, Namibia banned the cross-border movement of cattle into and out of northern neighbor Angola due to this outbreak of FMD. Surveillance teams had been deployed to stablish the extent of the outbreak (https://www.reuters.com/article/us-namibia-footandmouthdisease/namibia-restricts-cross-border-cattle-movement-over-foot-and-mouth-idUSKBN26S1OK). - Mod.CRD
