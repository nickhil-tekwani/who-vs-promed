Though COVID-19 cases are still declining globally, they are rising again in Africa and the Americas, the World Health Organization (WHO) said in its weekly pandemic report (https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/weekly-epidemiological-update-on-covid-19---27-april-2022).

Globally, COVID-19 cases have been declining since the middle of March [2022], and last week, cases fell 21% compared to the week before, while deaths declined 20% during the time period, the WHO said yesterday [27 Apr 2022]. It again urged caution in interpreting the trends, due to decreased levels of testing and sequencing.

However, it added that cases are up 32% in Africa and 9% in the Americas. At a WHO African regional office briefing today [28 Apr 2022], officials said a spike in South Africa's activity is driving Africa's rise (https://twitter.com/WHOAFRO/status/1519619863421100033).

In a new preprint study, South African researchers detailed what they know about the omicron BA.4 and BA.5 lineages that are contributing to the country's rising cases (https://krisp.org.za/manuscripts/MEDRXIV-2022-274406v1-deOliveira.pdf).

Commenting on the study on Twitter, Tulio de Oliveira, PhD, one of the authors, said the lineages originated in the middle of December [2021] and early January [2022], respectively. And though South African researchers characterized them, it's not clear where they originated. He directs South Africa's Centre for Epidemic Response and Innovation (https://twitter.com/Tuliodna/status/1519638640611237888).

He said so far, a rapid increase in infections over the last 2 weeks hadn't led to large numbers of hospitalizations and deaths, though there is an early signal of rising hospitalizations in some of South Africa's provinces. The viruses have a growth advantage over BA.2 that is similar to what BA.2 had over BA.1, and scientists are currently working to characterize immune escape with the 2 viruses.

de Oliveira said coming 4 months after the omicron BA.1 wave, waning immunity might be a contributing factor, but he said BA.4 and BA.5 impacts might play out differently by location, depending on the immunity situation.

In the Americas, cases were up 21% last week in the United States, most sharply in Puerto Rico, but increases were also high in parts of the Caribbean and in Argentina.

Though deaths were lower last week, South-East Asia's and Africa's levels were higher, due to delays in reporting.

Of roughly 4.5 million cases reported to the WHO last week, the 5 countries that reported the most cases were Germany, South Korea, France, Italy, and the United States.

In other global developments:
- Rounds of mass testing continue in China's capital city Beijing, where some schools and public places have been closed, as officials work toward avoiding a massive lockdown, similar to the one affecting Shanghai. Beijing's hot spot is the Chaoyang district, which is home to embassies and night life.
- Taiwan's daily cases have topped 10 000, as health officials predicted. Most are asymptomatic or mild, and 2 deaths were reported today [28 Apr 2022].

In a welcome development for many parents of young children, Moderna announced today [28 Apr 2022] that it has submitted a request to the Food and Drug Administration for emergency use authorization (EUA) of its COVID-19 vaccine for children 6 months to under 6 years of age (https://bit.ly/3ORN7WC).

The request is based on a 25-microgram 2-dose primary series of mRNA-1273. The application is based on favorable results seen during a phase 2/3 trial. No major safety events were recorded.

"We are proud to share that we have initiated our EUA submission for authorization for our COVID-19 vaccine for young children," said Stephane Bancel, chief executive officer of Moderna. "We believe mRNA-1273 will be able to safely protect these children against SARS-CoV-2, which is so important in our continued fight against COVID-19 and will be especially welcomed by parents and caregivers."

As reported last month [March 2022], the efficacy of the vaccine in this age-group against omicron strain COVID-19 infections is not as high compared to previous strains: 51% (95% confidence interval [CI], 21-69) for children 6 months to 2 years and 37% (95% CI, 13-54) for kids ages 2-6 years.

Children 5 and under in the United States are the only remaining age-group ineligible for COVID-19 vaccines, but efforts to authorize mRNA vaccines in this group have stalled since the beginning of the year [2022].

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention COVID Data Tracker shows 66.1% of Americans are fully vaccinated against COVID-19, 77.5% have received at least one dose of vaccine, and 45.7% of those eligible have received their 1st booster dose (https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations_vacc-total-admin-rate-total).

Meanwhile, COVID-19 cases continue to climb across the country. The United States reported 88 780 new COVID-19 cases yesterday [27 Apr 2022], and 800 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins COVID-19 tracker (https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/cumulative-cases).

The 7-day average of new daily cases is 53 432, with 355 daily deaths, according to The New York Times tracker (https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/covid-cases.html).

By then, Pfizer and BioNTech, its German partner, may have completed their own application for pediatric doses covering children 6 months to 4 years old.

"The companies' vaccines are different in key respects. Moderna is proposing a 2-dose regimen for children less than 6 years old, using one-fourth the strength of an adult dose. Pfizer and BioNTech are working on a 3-dose regimen, at one-tenth the strength of the adult dose. The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is already authorized for children 5 and older, giving the companies a track record with pediatric doses."

"...Omicron helped build up the nation's immunity. As of February [2022], 60% of Americans, including 75% of children, had been infected with the coronavirus at some point, according to research released this week by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). In December 2021, as the omicron variant began spreading, only half as many people had antibodies indicating prior infection, the agency said.

"Dr. Sean O'Leary, an infectious disease specialist at Children's Hospital Colorado, said the CDC's findings did not lessen the need to vaccinate young children. 'A lot of kids have been infected,' he said, but 'there is certainly additional benefit of getting vaccinated.'" - Mod.LK]

[2] Antibiotic impact on vaccination
Date: Thu 28 Apr 2022

https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2022/04/antibiotic-use-young-children-tied-reduced-vaccine-response


In a first-of-its-kind study, researchers have found that antibiotic use in young children is associated with lower vaccine-induced antibody responses to several childhood vaccines.

The study, published yesterday [27 Apr 2022] in Pediatrics, found that children 2 years of age and younger who had received antibiotics had lower levels of antibody protection from the diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis (DTaP) and pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) than those who received no antibiotics. They also found that antibiotic courses that were accumulated over time were negatively associated with vaccine-induced antibody levels (https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2021-052061).

While previous studies in mice and adult humans have suggested a link between antibiotics and the immune response to vaccination, the study is the first to find such a link in children. The study authors say the findings suggest an outcome that could leave children vulnerable to vaccine-preventable diseases and highlight the need for more research on antibiotics and vaccine-induced immunity.

The findings are based on a retrospective, secondary analysis of a cohort study of children ages 6-24 months in Rochester, New York, that focused on respiratory infections in the primary care setting, especially acute otitis media (ear infection). The children in the study -- all of whom had followed the recommended vaccine schedule -- had blood collected at well-child visits at 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, and 24 months of age.

Researchers with Rochester General Hospital Research Institute and the Rochester Institute of Technology reviewed the medical records of the children, questioned parents about illnesses and antibiotic prescriptions, and measured antibody response to the DTaP, PCV, inactivated polio (IPV), and _Haemophilus influenzae_ type b (Hib) vaccines from the provided blood samples. They then compared antibody levels in children who had received antibiotics with those who had received no antibiotics.

A total of 560 children met the criteria for inclusion. Of these children, 342 had received 1678 antibiotic courses, and 218 received no antibiotic courses. The predominant antibiotics prescribed were amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefdinir, and ceftriaxone. Receipt of antibiotics was heavily associated with daycare attendance.

The analysis found that from 9-24 months of age, the children who had received antibiotics had a higher frequency of vaccine-induced antibody levels for several DTaP and PCV antigens that were below the protective threshold, compared with the children who received no antibiotics. When the researchers compared all vaccine-induced antibody levels at all ages, they found that children who took antibiotics had a higher frequency of antibody levels below the protective threshold at 9 and 12 months; differences between the 2 groups were not statistically significant at other time points.

Among the antibiotics the children had received, cefdinir (odds ratio [OR], 1.58), ceftriaxone (OR, 1.39), and amoxicillin-clavulanate (OR, 1.58) were associated with lower antibody levels, but amoxicillin (OR, 1.26) was not.

The researchers also found that the number of antibiotic courses received in the 1st year of life had an impact on subsequent vaccine-induced antibody levels. Each antibiotic course received over the 1st year was associated with a 5.8% reduction in median antibody levels to DTaP, a 6.8% reduction in antibody levels for Hib, an 11.3% reduction in antibody levels for IPV, and a 10.4% reduction in PCV antibodies.

After booster shots of those vaccines (18-24 months), the impact on accumulated antibiotics was even greater: each antibiotic prescription was associated with a reduction in vaccine-induced antibody levels of 18.1% for DTaP, 21.3% for Hib, 18.9% for IPV, and 12.2% for PVC.

"The results reveal that antibiotic use is associated with lower antibody levels to several vaccine antigens and a frequency-dependent effect of antibiotic courses over time in the first 2 years of life," the authors wrote.

In a video abstract that accompanies the study, senior author Michael Pichichero, MD, of Rochester General Hospital Research Institute says that while the study is small and limited to children in one city, the findings nonetheless further highlight the need for careful use of antibiotics in children. "This is new information for pediatricians, and yet again more reason for judicious antibiotic prescribing," Pichichero said.

The findings also add to the growing body of research that suggests antibiotic exposure at an early age has impacts on children's health as they get older. In recent years, studies have found correlations between antibiotic exposure in the first 2 years of life and increased risk of obesity, allergies, and type 2 diabetes later in life.

While the mechanism behind these associations has not been identified, the emerging hypothesis, based mainly on research conducted in mice, is that it's likely tied to the effect that antibiotics can have on the composition and diversity of bacteria in the gut microbiome, which in young children is still developing.

A study of adults given broad-spectrum antibiotics before seasonal influenza vaccination found reduced bacterial load and a significant reduction in neutralizing antibody responses to the vaccine -- a finding that bolsters the case that antibiotic alteration of the gut microbiome may have an impact on vaccine immune response.

While their study did not include an analysis of stool samples to study the potential impact of antibiotics on the gut microbiomes of the enrolled children, Pichichero and his colleagues say future studies should do so.

In an editorial in the same journal, Octavio Ramilo, MD, and Asuncion Mejias, MD, PhD, of Nationwide Children's Hospital in Ohio, called the findings "remarkable" (https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2021-055610).

"Their observations could have major implications for clinical practice and should stimulate larger prospective multicenter studies involving more diverse populations to confirm these findings," they wrote. "Future studies should also include mechanistic analyses that permit understanding the origin of these reduced antibody responses, and eventually design approaches to mitigate their potential clinical impact."

[In the Commentary, Ramilo and Mejias state: "In this issue of Pediatrics, Chapman et al. provide initial evidence of an important factor that may contribute to the differences in immune responses among young children after vaccination. Based on previous studies, mostly conducted in animal models, the authors hypothesized that the composition and diversity of the gut microbiome play a significant role in immune development." The article is not open access, so more was not available. But the findings suggest that pediatricians should be careful to judiciously prescribe antibiotics to children. A larger study is needed to confirm the findings. - Mod.LK]

[3] CIDRAP perspective
[A] North-South COVID death divide

Using excess mortality data collected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), researchers from Georgetown University found significant regional differences in mortality rates due to COVID-19, with a disproportionate number of virus deaths in Southern states (https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0265053).

Excess deaths were analyzed for the period between 3 Jan 2020 and 26 Sep 2021, with Northeast, Midwest, South, and West regions compared. Though the South only has 38% of the US population, that region has seen 48% of the nation's COVID-19 deaths since October 2020.

Using the excess death data over that same time period, there were 895 693 excess deaths associated with COVID-19, 26% more than previously reported, the authors said. Since 31 May 2020, the South experienced COVID-19 mortality 26% higher than the national rate, whereas the Northeast's rate was 42% lower.

If every region had the same mortality rate as the Northeast, more than 316 234 COVID-19 deaths between 31 May 2020 and 26 Sep 2021 could have been avoided.

"Our study is the first to quantify avoidable deaths and confirm that both COVID-19 deaths and avoidable deaths disproportionately occurred in the South," said Michael Stoto, PhD, a corresponding author of the study in a press release (https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/950881).

The authors attribute these differences to lower vaccine uptake in the South in 2021, and fewer mitigation strategies, including masking, throughout the course of the pandemic.

An ongoing online UK program using singing techniques helped relieve post-COVID-19 mental wellbeing and persistent breathlessness, according to a randomized, controlled trial published yesterday [27 Apr 2022] in The Lancet Respiratory Medicine (https://bit.ly/3vPpOns).

Led by Imperial College London researchers, the trial involved 150 adults who still had shortness of breath, with or without anxiety, 4 or more weeks after symptom onset (average, 320 days), referred from 51 UK long-COVID clinics from 22 Apr 2021 to 25 May 2021. Eighty-one percent of participants were women.

Patients were randomly assigned to either the 6-week English National Opera (ENO) Breathe program, which teaches breath retraining using singing methods (74 participants), or usual care (76). The program is led by professional ENO singers and features a one-on-one session, weekly group sessions, and the provision of online services. Participants don't need to have singing skills and start with lullabies.

Relative to usual care, ENO Breathe was tied to improved mental health composite (MHC) -- but not physical health composite (PHC) -- scores on the RAND 36-item short-form survey (MHC improvement, 2.42 vs 0.60). The 100-point Visual Analogue Scales showed a 10.48-point reduction in breathlessness.

An analysis focusing on participants who attended all ENO Breathe sessions showed that 40% saw a 5-point improvement in MHC, compared with 17% of usual-care participants. One ENO Breathe participant reported minor, short-term dizziness when using a computer for long periods.

In an Imperial College London press release, lead author Keir Phillip, MBChB, said that the results suggest that the use of arts-related interventions can relieve long-COVID symptoms in certain patients, particularly when provided alongside clinical services (https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/951114).

"Our study suggests that the improvements in symptoms experienced by participants, resulted from both practical breathing techniques learnt, but also the creative, humane, and positive way the programme is delivered," he said. The study authors noted that 70 services in England have referred more than 1000 participants to the program since its September 2020 inception.

- The Americas region reported 16.8% of cases and 36.5% of deaths during the past 24 hours, having reported more than 152.78 million cases, 2nd to the European region as the most severely affected region. The USA reported 63 129 cases in the last 24 hours, followed by Brazil, Canada, Costa Rica, Puerto Rico, Chile, and Mexico -- all reporting more than 1000 cases. Additionally, Barbados, Trinidad & Tobago, Panama, Guatemala, and Peru reported more than 500 but fewer than 1000 cases in the last 24 hours. Argentina, Cuba, and Uruguay, among others, did not report cases over the last 24 hours.

- The European region reported 50.0% of cases and 38.2% of deaths over the last 24 hours, as the most affected region, with cumulative cases exceeding 214.29 million. Some countries reporting few or no cases in the last 24 hours or longer include Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, Sweden, and Tajikistan, among others. A total of 16 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours, with 5 reporting more than 10 000 and 11 reporting over 1000 cases, and 9 countries reported more than 500 but fewer than 1000 cases.
