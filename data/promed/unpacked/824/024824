2 labs confirmed Pentagon anthrax
-------------------------------
Anthrax has been confirmed in samples collected from the 2 Pentagon
mail facilities that were at first closed last week and then declared
free of the pathogen, United Press International has learned. The
head of the company that was accused of contaminating the samples
sent from those facilities -- a detached building on the Pentagon
grounds in Arlington, Va., and the other in Falls Church, Va. -- said
the presence of anthrax was detected independently by 2 government
laboratories. Robert B. Harris, president and chief executive officer
of Commonwealth Biotechnologies Inc. in Richmond, Va., also said the
anthrax found was the same genetic strain used in the 2001 attacks.
[There has since -- on Fri 18 Mar 2005-- been a 3rd alert at Bolling
Air Force Base triggered by automatic sensors, which apparently is
now regarded as a negative after FBI testing.]
The week of anthrax alarms began when the Pentagon mail facility was
closed 14 Mar 2005, after tests on samples taken there the week
before had been found positive for the presence of anthrax. The
initial samples, consisting of swabs of surfaces from the facility,
had been collected 10 Mar, but the results were not received and the
facility was not shut down until 14 Mar. The delay was not the fault
of CBI, Harris said, noting CBI had tested more than 2000 similar
samples in the past 2 years and reported its results within 24 hours.
"We reported our initial ...findings on (11 Mar)," Harris told UPI.
"Our contracting officer told us to continue testing for further
analysis over the weekend -- and that was done. On Monday ... the
14th we communicated additional test results to our contracting
officer. From CBI's point of view, there was absolutely no delay in
reporting the results."
CBI is a sub-contractor that conducts routine testing. The identity
of the prime contractor who received the results is unclear. Defense
Department spokesman Glenn Flood told UPI the 4-day delay was being
investigated.
Harris also took issue with the anonymous suggestion in news reports
that his lab had contaminated the original sample from the Pentagon
site. "It is a fact that we had a presumptive positive test come up,"
he said. "That presumptive positive test was confirmed by us and by
at least 2 other labs as being a true positive."
Carlee Vander Linden, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Army Medical
Research Institute of Infectious Diseases in Frederick, Md., which
tested the samples after CBI, confirmed that the follow-up tests on
the 1st sample were positive and that 2 labs had done such tests.
"There is a component of the Homeland Security Department that has a
laboratory that is located in our building," Vander Linden explained.
"They have a presence here at Fort Detrick. The samples were
basically parted [portioned?] out, and there was analysis done by
USAMRIID and by the forensics lab under DHS. I know that the
negatives that we got were on the ones that came directly from the
(mail) facility and did not pass through the contractor. The
positives that we got were on samples that had been handled already
by the people in Virginia."
Vander Linden also said: "USAMRIID is not saying that, 'Gee, there
probably was a contamination event.' I think some people are
surmising that. It certainly has been reported that way. I think that
we'll just have to wait and see."
A DHS lab did conduct confirmatory tests, said Terry Bishop, a
spokesman for DOD Health Affairs, but he did elaborate on the results.
"It is in our mind that this was truly a positive sample," said
Harris, adding that his technicians had done everything possible to
minimize contamination and were reviewing their lab and procedures.
"I emphasize," Harris said, "in over 2000 of these samples and tens
of thousands ... of other samples we have never experienced a
false-positive test."
In response to a question from UPI, Harris confirmed CBI also had
conducted other tests on the anthrax sample, but he would not reveal
the results. ... Harris also said the anthrax in the initial samples
was the same strain as the organism used during the 1st anthrax
attack via U.S. Mail facilities in the fall of 2001. This was not
surprising, however, he said, because it is the most common [sic; see
comment below - Mod.MHJ] strain.
Questions over the 1st alarm were still swirling when the 3rd alarm
sounded last Friday at Bolling, which is located along the Anacostia
River in Washington, in a mail-handling facility used by the Defense
Intelligence Agency.
"This morning, the DIA remote-delivery facility was closed due to an
initial positive test of incoming mail for hazardous biological
agents," Defense Department spokesman Maj. Paul Swiergosz told UPI
last Friday afternoon [18 Mar]. Personnel on the scene were asked to
stay, Swiergosz said, and local officials were called. An FBI team
conducted further tests. As of late Friday, the follow-up tests at
the scene had been negative, said FBI spokeswoman Debbie Weierman.
Additional tests were planned at a laboratory.
The week's events raised concern about cross-contamination from a
source of anthrax somewhere in the Defense Department mail system.
All of the alerts occurred in defense-related mail facilities, and in
each case the alerts were specific for anthrax, several federal and
local DOD spokesmen confirmed during the week. The bioweapons sensors
were not connected, UPI was told repeatedly by the spokesmen. The
sensors in Fairfax and at Bolling were automatic and did not involve
any CBI testing. UPI also was told by a Defense Department
spokeswoman that, in at least one case, the alerts followed the mail
flow. Specifically, the mail from the Pentagon site could have moved
to the Falls Church location.
The Pentagon is working to gather more than 8000 pieces of mail that
moved through its detached facility between 10 and 14 Mar 2005.

[Let me try to summarise this report: [1] CBI tested their 10 Mar
samples, and on 11 Mar informed the prime contractor of the positive
results that day. The latter told them to keep looking. Pentagon was
informed on 14 Mar by the contractor. [2] USAMRIID says that the
samples directly from the mail facility were negative but the samples
from the contractor were positive. [3] The CEO/President of CBI says
that their laboratory identified their positives as being "Ames",
which he says "was not surprising ... because it is the most common
strain."
What fun! Investigation will in due course determine where the
"positive samples" originated, presumably with embarrassment in one
quarter or another. And we now have the FBI analysing samples.
To claim that "Ames" is the most common strain must reflect that most
US research laboratories now insist on having it, out of laboratory
testosterone presumably. Why a surveillance laboratory might have
this culture on hand surpasses all understanding -- when there is
always the risk of cross-contamination. Apropos, in my lab we not
only kept it very, very clean but never ever allowed Sterne anywhere
near because of its ability to fly around -- it was _the_ most common
contaminant in archival collections sent to us. If a laboratory must
have a culture on hand for quality control, it would be logical to
most people to use a most infrequent isolate, say "C," which has only
been found once and has no close relatives. If a "positive" arose, a
quick check would show whether it was an in-house contaminant. To be
very charitable, it is less than wise to use Ames, which already has
a Post Office reputation for trouble.
As ever, our thanks to Joe. - Mod.MHJ]
