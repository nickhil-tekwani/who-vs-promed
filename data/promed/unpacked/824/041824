An outbreak of _E. coli_ [O157] in Edmonton, Alberta is possibly linked to fresh bean sprouts from a local grower, according to a public health official. The Alberta Health Services issued a public warning on 1 Aug 2014 but did not name a grower, and no recall has been issued.

As of 1 Aug 2014, officials had confirmed 24 _E. coli_ [O157] cases in the Edmonton area in the previous 2 weeks, according to multiple media reports. Calls to the Alberta Health Services were not immediately returned.

Dr. Christopher Sikora, lead medical officer for the Edmonton zone of the Alberta Health Services, is quoted by newspaper and radio reports as saying 21 of the sick people reported eating fresh bean sprouts before becoming ill. Five of the people had to be hospitalized.

"There is likely no ongoing risk to the public," Sikora told the Edmonton Journal newspaper. "There is a single Edmonton-based producer for sprouts, and we're still investigating at this point in time. We may or may not find out the reason for the contamination."

The Canadian Press news service reported the Edmonton sprout grower supplies restaurants and grocery stores. The grower's operation was not shut down, according to the Calgary Herald and other media.

Sikora is quoted by multiple media outlets as saying the outbreak is unusual because, during all of 2013, there were only 20 cases in the Edmonton region.

The 1 Aug 2014 health advisory issued by Alberta Health Services encourages the public to thoroughly wash fresh fruits and vegetables and cook beef to 160 F [71 C] to reduce risks of _E. coli_ infection.

[The official provincial report confirms the isolates as serotype O157.

Sprouts are a very notable vehicle for EHEC. Sprouting generally involves germinating seeds (which may be contaminated) at temperatures higher than ambient temperature, facilitating a higher bacterial inoculum. Sprouts have been the vehicle for 2 notable outbreaks. In July 1996, almost 10 000 cases of _E. coli_ O157:H7 occurred primarily in schoolchildren in Sakai City, Osaka, Japan, transmitted by white radish sprouts (1). During 2011, an outbreak centered in northern Germany (2) involved a chimeric, non-zoonotic EHEC/EAEC _E. coli_ O104:H4 spread by fenugreek sprouts and infecting almost 4000 people. This unique outbreak produced one of the largest number of deaths ever reported from a Shiga toxin-producing _E. coli_, more than 50.
