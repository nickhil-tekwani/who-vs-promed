Pathogens similar to little cherry disease are found in peaches and nectarines. Premature yellowing, reddening and curling of leaves, and dieback could indicate Western X or pear decline phytoplasma.

"We looked at some very unhappy-looking peaches and nectarines and found a couple of phytoplasmas [in Washington state]," said Scott Harper, Clean Plant Center Northwest. He identified 2 phytoplasmas, Western X and peach yellow leaf roll phytoplasma, also known as pear decline. Western X is one of the pathogens linked to cherry disease across the Pacific Northwest [ProMED-mail post 20181108.6132710].

Western X, Harper said, might be the cause of peach rosette and peach yellows -- which lead to problems with leaves and fruit size and distorted or misshapen fruit -- noted in the Carolinas and Georgia. Generally, it will kill a tree gradually over the course of 5 to 10 years. Pear decline kills a tree faster, usually within 3 to 5 years. Leaves twist and curl downward, then they turn yellow and drop, affecting fruit quality and size. The problem is common in California, and it's possibly moving north. Plant pathologists know of a 3rd phytoplasma in Washington -- asteris -- but don't know whether it's causing any damage. It begets small leaves, affects tree vigor and fruit size and causes a condition named peach little leaf.

Harper said: "We know material is moving around, and it's very hard to track." The phytoplasmas do not distinguish between cherries, peaches and nectarines and may affect other forms of stone fruit, too. The diseases have no cure. By the time symptoms appear, growers usually must cut down the entire tree.

Growers hope the research leads to some solid practical information about how to recognize the problems in the field, similar to the way cherry growers are learning to spot little cherry disease [ProMED-mail posts 20180108.5545889, 20140127.2233739]. Most stone fruit growers also have cherries.

[Phytoplasmas of the 16SrIII taxonomic group cause X diseases (such as Western-X, Canada-X; _Candidatus_ Phytoplasma pruni) of stone fruit (_Prunus_ spp). Symptoms and host specificity differ for members of the group. X-disease symptoms in cherry (also called cherry buckskin) vary with the cultivar and rootstock combinations but are often similar to the viral little cherry disease (LCD; caused by 2 closteroviruses in single or mixed infections).

Pear decline phytoplasma (_Ca._ P. pyri) belongs to the 16SrX taxonomic group, which also includes apple proliferation phytoplasma (_Ca._ P. mali) and apricot chlorotic leaf roll phytoplasma (_Ca._ P. prunorum; also called European stone fruit yellows phytoplasma). It appears likely that the report above actually refers to the latter, rather than the pear pathogen. Phytoplasmas of this group are considered the most serious pathogens of stone and pome fruits in Europe.

The aster yellows phytoplasma group (_Ca._ P. asteris], 16SrI taxonomic group) is one of the most diverse phytoplasma groups known. Members cause or are involved in a large number of serious crop diseases and can infect over 300 host species.

Phytoplasmas can be spread by sap sucking insects (mostly leaf hoppers), grafting, with contaminated tools (such as during pruning of trees) and with tissue cultures. They survive in asymptomatic crop hosts or non-crop reservoir species. Disease management of phytoplasmas is difficult and generally includes vector control, removal of infected plants and other sources of inoculum, as well as the use of certified clean planting and propagating material. Such measures require reliable molecular diagnostic methods and coordinated efforts on a regional scale, especially when dealing with long-lived tree crops.
