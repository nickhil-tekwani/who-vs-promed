Over the past 2 years, there has been an increase in the number of
rabbits on Canterbury farms now immune to the natural rabbit
haemorrhagic disease, or calicivirus. Annual figures collected at the
end of each spring show the McKenzie Basin, Amuri, and the Ashburton
Hill Country are 3 areas where rabbit numbers are rising. In some
places there are now more rabbits than before the disease was
introduced. Environment Canterbury biosecurity team leader Brent
Glentworth says over the region, there has been an average increase
of 3 rabbits per square kilometre.

Mr Glentworth says they are telling farmers to take rabbit control
seriously as there are now a lot more rabbits in parts of Canterbury.

[This apparent emerging population immunity was to be expected. The
questions now are (1) what are its components, and (2) why did it
take 8-9 years to emerge -- why not 4 or 16 years? - Mod MHJ
