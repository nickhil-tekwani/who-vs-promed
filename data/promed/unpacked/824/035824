HCM City's [Ho Chi Minh City or Saigon - the old name] Preventive
Medicine Centre has reported nearly 2700 cases of mosquito-borne
dengue fever in the city since the beginning of 2006, twice the
number reported during the same period last year [2005].
The Dengue Fever Department of Children's Hospital 1 was crowded on
Tuesday. Over 84 children were receiving treatment with many beds
being shared by 2 patients.
"The hospital has treated 1167 children suffering from dengue fever
this year," Nguyen Thanh Hung, director of the hospital, said. "Of
them, 876 were from [the city's] districts 6 and 8." Dengue fever, a
tropical disease is transmitted by mosquitoes carrying the virus, and
never between humans. Its symptoms include a high fever, rash, and
severe head and joint aches. Nausea, vomiting, and loss of appetite
are also common.
"The disease can be fatal for children and the elderly or weak," Hung
said. A one-year-old child from District 6 died of the disease during May 2006.
The number of children receiving treatment at another paediatric
facility, Children's Hospital 2, also increased this week. On Tuesday
alone it admitted 35 children with 5 of them having signs of shock.
Dr. Nguyen Van Be, head of District 8's Preventive Medicine Office,
said for many years the incidence of dengue had been high in the
district where the number of people with access to tap water is low.
"Most people store water for use in jars and buckets. This has
created ideal conditions for mosquitoes to breed," he said. District
8 had a high number of migrants and most of them did not understand
much about this fatal disease.
Reports from the city's Pasteur Institute said dengue fever had
killed 3 people so far in 2006 in the Mekong Delta province of Hau
Giang. The Preventive Medicine Centre in the delta's Can Tho city
reports 20 cases of dengue fever everyday.

Despite the multiple actions carried out in El Salvador to control
the epidemics of dengue, seriously affecting that population,
infection cases increase, revealed Thursday official sources.
Interviewed on the issue Health Minister Guillermo Maza admitted the
speedy increase of infections in the Salvadorian nation.
According to reports released by the State Secretary under his
charge, the country's present conditions are favorable for the
development of the disease.
The national larval index was estimated at 6.1 in March and at 6.5 in
April 2006 while recent controls reflect a 20-percent increase of
infection cases in relation to last week when they similarly raised
in 14 percent.
Public Health authorities confirmed there were 137 infected people
reported to public health centers 11-17 Jun. The week before the
official number was 114.
This virus is mainly transmitted by the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito,
which reproduces in stagnant water and the insalubrious zones where
the poorest population lives.
