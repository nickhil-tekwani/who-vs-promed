[1A] Surge poses puzzle
Date: Wed 21 Apr 2021

The virus is spreading faster than ever before in India despite previous high infection rates in megacities, which should have conferred some protection.

The pandemic is sweeping through India at a pace that has staggered scientists. Daily case numbers have exploded since early March 2021: the government reported 273 810 new infections nationally on 18 Apr 2021. High numbers in India have also helped drive global cases to a daily high of 854 855 in the past week, almost breaking a record set in January 2021.

Just months earlier, antibody data had suggested that many people in cities such as Delhi and Chennai had already been infected, leading some researchers to conclude that the worst of the pandemic was over in the country.

Researchers in India are now trying to pinpoint what is behind the unprecedented surge, which could be due to an unfortunate confluence of factors, including the emergence of particularly infectious variants, a rise in unrestricted social interactions, and low vaccine coverage. Untangling the causes could be helpful to governments trying to suppress or prevent similar surges around the world.

European countries such as France and Germany are also currently experiencing large outbreaks relative to their size, and nations including Brazil and the United States are reporting high infection rates at around 70 000 a day. But India's daily totals are now some of the highest ever recorded for any country and are not far off a peak of 300 000 cases seen in the United States on 2 Jan 2021.

COVID-19 case numbers started to drop in India last September 2020, after a high of around 100 000 daily infections. But they began to rise again in March 2021, and the current peak is more than double the previous one.

"The 2nd wave has made the last one look like a ripple in a bathtub," says Zarir Udwadia, a clinician-researcher in pulmonary medicine at P D Hinduja Hospital & Medical Research Centre in Mumbai, who spoke to Nature during a break from working in the intensive-care unit. He describes a "nightmarish" situation at hospitals, where beds and treatments are in extremely short supply.

Shahid Jameel, a virologist at Ashoka University in Sonipat, agrees that the intensity of the current wave is startling. "I was expecting fresh waves of infection, but I would not have dreamt that it would be this strong," he says.

Studies that tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies -- an indicator of past infection -- in December 2020 and January 2021 estimated that more than 50% of the population in some areas of India's large cities had already been exposed to the virus, which should have conferred some immunity, says Manoj Murhekar, an epidemiologist at the National Institute of Epidemiology in Chennai, who led the work. The studies also suggested that, nationally, some 271 million people had been infected, about 1/5th of India's population of 1.4 billion.

These figures made some researchers optimistic that the next stage of the pandemic would be less severe, says Ramanan Laxminarayan, an epidemiologist in Princeton University, New Jersey, who is based in New Delhi. But the latest eruption of COVID-19 is forcing them to rethink.

One explanation might be that the 1st wave primarily hit the urban poor. Antibody studies may not have been representative of the entire population and potentially overestimated exposure in other groups, he says.

The antibody data did not reflect the uneven spread of the virus, agrees Gagandeep Kang, a virologist at the Christian Medical College in Vellore, India. "The virus may be getting into populations that were previously able to protect themselves," she says. That could include wealthier urban communities, in which people isolated during the 1st wave but had started mingling by the 2nd.

But some researchers say that the speed and scale of the current outbreak suggest a new ingredient: emerging variants of the virus.

Udwadia has anecdotally observed that entire households are now getting infected, unlike in the 1st wave of COVID-19, when single individuals would test positive. He attributes this to the presence of more-infectious variants. "If one person in the family has it, I can guarantee that everyone in the family has it," he says.

Genomic surveillance data show that the variant B.1.1.7, which was 1st identified in the United Kingdom, has become the dominant form of the virus in the Indian state of Punjab.

And a new and potentially concerning variant 1st identified in India late last year [2020], known as B.1.617, has become dominant in the state of Maharashtra. B.1.617 has drawn attention because it contains 2 mutations that have been linked to increased transmissibility and an ability to evade immune protection. It has now been detected in 20 other countries. Laboratories in India are trying to culture it to test how fast it replicates, and whether blood from vaccinated individuals can block infection, says Jameel.

The situation in India looks similar to that late last year [2020] in Brazil, he adds, where a resurgence of COVID-19 in the city of Manaus coincided with the spread of a highly transmissible variant known as P.1, which might have been able to evade immunity conferred by infections with earlier strains.

But others say that the existing sequencing data are not sufficient to make such claims. "As the numbers of sequences available are low, relative to the number of cases in India, we do need to be cautious," says David Robertson, a virologist at the University of Glasgow, UK.

Some say that emerging variants account for only a small part of India's surge in infections. In many regions that are experiencing outbreaks, they don't make up the majority of genomes sequenced, says Anurag Agrawal, director of the CSIR Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology in New Delhi.

Srinath Reddy, an epidemiologist and head of the Public Health Foundation of India in New Delhi, argues that people letting their guards down is a bigger driver. "The pandemic resurfaced in a fully open society where people were mixing and moving and travelling," he says.

With cases declining after last September's [2020] peak, "there was a public narrative that India had conquered COVID-19," says Laxminarayan. In recent months, large crowds have gathered indoors and outdoors for political rallies, religious celebrations, and weddings.

The nationwide vaccination campaign, which kicked off in January 2021, might even have contributed to an uptick in cases, if it caused people to ease public-health measures. "The arrival of the vaccine put everyone into a relaxed mood," says Laxminarayan.

More than 120 million doses have been administered, mostly of an Indian-produced version of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine called Covishield. But that's less than 10% of India's population, so there is still a long way to go. In particular, India needs to ramp up vaccinations in the hardest-hit regions, says Kang.

Some people might have become infected while getting vaccines, says Udwadia, because crowds often share clinic waiting areas with ill people who are waiting to be seen.

["India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed the nation. He said the oxygen demand is felt in many parts of the country, and federal, state, and private groups are working to bolster the supply, according to the Times of India.

"Modi also said efforts are underway to increase hospital bed capacity, with large dedicated COVID-19 facilities under construction in some cities. However, he urged India's states to only consider lockdowns as a last resort and opt for establishing "micro containment zones."

"In other steps, the government opened vaccination to all people older than 18 and is taking steps to increase the vaccine supply by waiving import fees, according to Reuters.

"Indian experts have said a combination of social mixing, relaxed measures, and more transmissible variants -- including B1617, 1st seen in India -- are fueling the country's massive 2nd surge. Political rallies in some states and a large Hindu religious gathering on the banks of the Ganges River in the city of Hardiwar are also playing a role in virus spread, and the Modi's political party announced it will no longer hold large rallies in West Bengal state and will cap attendance at 500, according to CNN" (20 Apr 2021, CIDRAP https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/04/indias-covid-19-surge-intensifies). - Mod.LK]

[b] Registration of deaths
Date: Mon 19 Apr 2021 6:47 p.m. PDT
Source: Reuters [abridged, edited]
https://www.reuters.com/world/india/non-stop-cremations-cast-doubt-indias-counting-covid-dead-2021-04-19/?fbclid=IwAR2TBf4ouq9Ab5rqLeQ3duPALhuFYPXK1JG7RAxb6jbvnaeNYWEzG2SslFU


India is not the only country to have its coronavirus statistics questioned. But the testimony of workers and a growing body of academic literature suggest deaths in India are being underreported compared to other countries.

Mukherjee's research of India's 1st wave concludes that there were 11 times more infections than were reported, in line with estimates from studies in other countries. There were also between 2 and 5 times as many deaths than were reported, far in excess of global averages.

The Lancet medical journal noted last year that 4 Indian states making up 65% of COVID fatalities nationally each registered 100% of their coronavirus deaths.

But fewer than a quarter of deaths in India are medically certified, particularly in rural areas, meaning the true COVID death rate in many of India's 24 other states may never be known.

"Most of the deaths are not registered, so it's impossible to do a validation calculation," Mukherjee said.

[c] 2nd wave
Date: Tue 20 Apr 2021
Source: BBC [abridged, edited]
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-56811315


Experts say this rapid increase shows that the 2nd wave is spreading much faster across the country. Dr A Fathahudeen, who is part of Kerala state's COVID taskforce, said the rise was not entirely unexpected, given that India let its guard down when daily infections in January [2021] fell to fewer than 20 000 from a peak of over 90 000 in September [2020].

Big religious gatherings, the reopening of most public places, and crowded election rallies are being blamed for the uptick. Dr Fathahudeen said there were warning signs in February [2021], but "we did not get our act together."

Many Indian cities are reporting a chronic shortage of hospital beds. It's also evident in the desperate cries for help on social media platforms. Disturbing reports of people dying without getting timely treatment are coming from all over the country.

Several state governments say they are creating new facilities, but experts say it's going to be hard to keep up with the pace of the rising number of infections.

India has been consistently reporting more than 150 000 cases for days now. It reported 273 810 cases on Monday [19 Apr 2021], the biggest daily spike since the pandemic began.

Badly affected cities like Delhi, Mumbai, and Ahmedabad have almost run out of hospital beds. The situation is not very different in other cities, such as Lucknow, Bhopal, Kolkata, Allahabad, and Surat.

The situation is much more dire when it comes to ICU beds. Several cities have just a few dozen ICU beds left, and they are now frantically trying to build extra capacity in hotels and stadiums.

But getting ICU beds up and running quickly is not easy. Dr Fathahudeen says adding beds alone is not enough. "We need to ensure that most of these beds have oxygen facility. We need more doctors and nurses to manage extra ICU beds," he adds.

He says it's going to be a "daunting task" for the government to get such facilities up and running and ensure good quality of care in a short span of time.

India on 25 Mar [2021] announced that a new "double mutant" variant of the coronavirus had been detected from samples collected from different states.

Virologist Shahid Jameel explained that a "double mutation in key areas of the virus's spike protein may make the virus more infectious and allow it to escape the immune system."

"By December, India had done genome sequencing of only 5000 samples. It wasn't a concentrated effort," [Dr Jameel said].

In January [2021], India put together a group of labs to speed up sequencing, and these labs started functioning in February [2021]. "But unfortunately, the 2nd wave started, and the vision of sequencing roughly 5% of the total samples did not come through."

Sequencing becomes important in a pandemic as it allows scientists to monitor changes in the virus. "If you can catch a more infectious variant early on in a region, you can quickly put in public health measures to stop it from spreading wider in the community," he explains.

[2] J&J vaccine
Date: Wed 21 Apr 2021
Source: New York Times [abridged, edited]
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/20/us/coronavirus-today-vaccines.html


The Johnson & Johnson coronavirus vaccine should come with a warning about rare and unusual blood clots, but it should not be pulled from use, the European Union's drug regulator said on Tuesday [20 Apr 2021].

The European Medicines Agency noted that the risks are "very rare" and that the overall benefits "outweigh the risks of side effects."

The recommendation is not binding, and each country in the E.U. will ultimately decide what is right for its population. Johnson & Johnson said it would resume its vaccine rollout in Europe.

Last month [March 2021], a few dozen blood clots also appeared in connection with the AstraZeneca vaccine, a 2-dose treatment. (The agency said the clots between the 2 vaccines were "very similar.") European countries quickly paused use or restricted it to older people.

Last week, when Johnson & Johnson decided to delay its European rollout, vaccine options dropped further. The move came after regulators in the U.S. called for a pause to investigate the rare clotting, which is known to have affected 6 people out of nearly 8 million.

The E.U. agency's recommendation, although positive for the vaccine, may be too little and too late. Many Europeans have been refusing to take the AstraZeneca vaccine, even though the agency found that its benefits outweighed its risks and recommended that E.U. members should use it.

"Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) (the Company) today [Tue 20 Apr 2021] announced that the European Medicines Agency's (EMA) Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) has provided updated guidance for use of the Company's COVID-19 vaccine and confirmed the overall benefit-risk profile remains positive. The guidance follows PRAC review of a small number of cases of a very rare adverse event involving blood clots in combination with low platelet counts that can occur within approximately one to 3 weeks following injection with the Company's COVID-19 vaccine.

"As a result, Johnson & Johnson will update its COVID-19 vaccine Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet to include important information on the diagnosis and management of this very rare adverse event. Healthcare professionals will be alerted to the signs and symptoms of thromboembolism with thrombocytopenia, as well as the appropriate course of treatment."

This is welcome news, as the J&J vaccine offers the benefit of substantial immunity after a single dose. Including a warning of possible rare adverse side effects, especially in women, and management suggestions is appropriate. The vaccinees should be warned when the vaccine is administered, but at the same time made aware of the rarity of adverse side effects so they can make an informed decision as to whether to go forward with the immunization. - Mod.LK]
