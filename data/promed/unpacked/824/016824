I have done research on _Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis_ for more than 30 years and agree fully with everything relayed by the other contributors. However, a few things were not clarified:

1st - This infection in horses may be more common in horse-rearing parts of New Mexico (e.g., central to north-central). On one occasion, I spoke to a veterinarian who had seen over 1000 (yes, that's 1000) cases in his practice area that season.

2nd - An important correlate with the occurrence of ventral abscesses is the presence of tabanids (horseflies). No experimental work exists to back this up, but the scenario derived from field observations is that the flies bite horses on the ventral surface, and individual horses may have a dozen or more such bites. _C. pseudotuberculosis_ in the soil then contaminates the wounds when the horse lies in sternal recumbency [on its chest]. The horsefly has been reported (anecdotally) to positively affect the incidence of disease on individual properties.

3rd - To the best of my knowledge, there is no vaccine with a label claim for horses. Colorado Serum Company has a product for use in sheep, and they may have acquired approval for use in goats; contact the company in Denver if interested. One might be concerned that the same product, used off-label in horses, would not be effective. As pointed out in an earlier portion of the thread, one biotype of _C. pseudotuberculosis_ (biovar ovis) affects sheep and goats, and a 2nd biovar (biovar equi) infects horses. This distinction is not absolute, but the host preference holds up in about 95 percent of cases with both biovars.

Finally, I reinitiated work on _C. pseudotuberculosis_ after my move to Iowa State. This includes genomic sequencing of organisms from biovars equi and ovis in an attempt to determine how the strains are different and how these differences might contribute to host preference. I would be happy to hear from producers, practitioners, academicians, industrial researchers, and development types, and others who might want to discuss the subject. This is a fascinating disease, one which I'd be happy, for the sake of horse owners and practitioners, to see disappear.

[ProMED thanks Dr. Songer for these valuable insights.

This disease is more often seen in dry weather, and especially in drought conditions. Tabanid flies do not always seem prevalent in dry climates. - Mod.TG
