The World Health Organization (WHO) recently confirmed that a previously reported and unknown illness in Tanzania's Kigoma Region is the result of hepatitis E virus. 15 out of the 46 samples tested at a lab in Nairobi, Kenya, were positive for hepatitis virus E. The WHO said arrangements are ongoing for molecular characterisation tests and genotyping.

Between 20 Aug 2013 and 29 Oct 2013, the region's Buhigwe District experienced 690 acute febrile illness cases with no deaths. Most patients presented with vomiting, loss of appetite, generalized body weakness, abdominal pain, high fever, and headache. A small proportion of the cases experienced diarrhoea and jaundice. There was a delay in detection and confirmation of the outbreak because most of the initial cases were treated as malaria, due to similar clinical symptoms. Approximately 61 percent of reported cases occurred in individuals below the age of 15 years. Approximately 54 percent of the cases occurred in females.

After the hepatitis E outbreak was confirmed, Tanzania's Ministry of Health and Social Welfare began conducting further field investigations to determine the magnitude, source, and risk factors for the outbreak. Prevention and control measures are ongoing.

The WHO did not recommend any trade or travel restrictions be applied to Tanzania with respect to the recent event.

[This report is posted in response to ProMED-mail's request for information of 23 Nov 2013, entitled "Undiagnosed febrile illness - Niger, Tanzania: RFI" archive no 20131123.2069748. It is likely, but not confirmed here, that the outbreak of a the febrile disease in Nigeria is likewise the result of hepatitis E virus infection.

Hepatitis E is usually self-limiting but may develop into fulminant hepatitis (acute liver failure). Hepatitis E virus is transmitted via the faecal-oral route, principally via contaminated water. Hepatitis E is found worldwide and different genotypes of the hepatitis E virus determine differences in epidemiology. For example, genotype 1 is usually seen in developing countries and causes community-level outbreaks, while genotype 3 is usually seen in the developed countries and does not cause outbreaks. Globally, 57 000 deaths and 3.4 million cases of acute hepatitis E are attributable to infection with hepatitis E virus genotypes 1 and 2.

The highest seroprevalence rates are observed in regions where low standards of sanitation increase the risk for transmission of the virus. Over 60 percent of all hepatitis E infections and 65 percent of all hepatitis E deaths occur in East and South Asia, where seroprevalence rates of 25 percent are common in some age groups.

There is no available treatment capable of altering the course of acute hepatitis. Prevention is the most effective approach against the disease. As hepatitis E is usually self-limiting, hospitalization is generally not required. However, hospitalization is required for people with fulminant hepatitis and should also be considered for infected pregnant women. The risk of infection and transmission can be reduced by maintaining quality standards for public water supplies and establishing proper disposal systems to eliminate sanitary waste.
