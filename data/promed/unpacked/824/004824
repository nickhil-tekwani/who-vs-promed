Malaysia's eastern state of Sarawak said it was stepping up efforts
to control an epidemic of hand, foot and mouth disease, with
indications it was spreading to rural areas.
The state's deputy chief minister, George Chan, said Sarawak would
deploy its flying doctor service to monitor people for symptoms of
the disease, which affects mainly infants and young children and
causes mouth and throat ulcers.
The death toll from the disease has climbed from 7 to 8, while cases
have been recorded in the state's interior as well as the smaller
towns of Mukah, on the central coast, and Kapit in central Sarawak,
Chan said.
The majority of cases have so far been recorded in Sarawak's main
towns, including its capital, Kuching.
The minister said the state would also increase staff numbers in
hospitals to cope with the situation.
Sarawak has been hit periodically by the disease. In the worst
outbreak in 1997, the state on Borneo island recorded 31 fatalities.

Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) of humans is commonly confused
with foot-and-mouth disease of cattle, sheep, and swine. Although the
names are similar, the diseases are not related and are caused by
different viruses. For information on foot-and-mouth disease, please
visit
<http://www.aphis.usda.gov/lpa/issues/fmd/fmd.html>.
HFMD is a common illness of infants and children. It is characterized
by fever, sores in the mouth, and a rash with blisters. For a picture
of hand lesions, see

upID=327>.
HFMD is caused by enteroviruses. Among them, EV 71 and coxsackievirus
A16 are the 2 major pathogens. HFMD is usually spread by
person-to-person contact. For the HFMD fact sheet, please visit the
USA CDC website at
