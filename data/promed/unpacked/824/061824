Ebola hemorrhagic fever in Gabon/Republic of Congo: WHO update 9
-----------------------------------------------------------------
As of Thu 27 Dec 2001, 29 confirmed cases (12 laboratory confirmed and 17
epidemiologically linked), including 20 deaths, have been reported. An
additional 8 suspected cases are under investigation in Gabon. All contacts
(having direct or suspected contact with the blood or other body fluids of
a case) are being monitored closely for signs or symptoms of Ebola
hemorrhagic fever for 21 days. Currently, 206 contacts are under active
follow up. We anticipate one or more cases may develop among these contacts.
Of the 29 cases, 17 were detected in Gabon and 12 in the neighboring
villages of the Republic of the Congo (detailed map of the area can be
accessed at the above URL). As of Thu 27 Dec 2001, 91 contacts are being
followed up in Gabon and 115 in the Republic of the Congo. The
international team is operational on both sides of the border and is
working closely in the field with the teams from the Congolese and Gabonese
Ministries of Health on outbreak control interventions.

[Since the previous WHO Update released on Mon 24 Dec 2001, there has been
no dramatic change in the situation, and the outbreak appears to be
contained at present. In the 4 days from Sun 23 Dec to Thu 27 Dec, the
number of confirmed cases has increased from 27 to 29 (both new cases in
Gabon). The number of suspected cases has increased by one, the death toll
has risen from 18 to 20, and the number of contacts under surveillance has
risen from 203 to 206; down 18 in Gabon and up 21 in Republic of Congo. -
