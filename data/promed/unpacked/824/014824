More New Jerseyans Have Tested Positive for West Nile Virus
---------------------------------------------------------------.
A 72-year-old Newark man and a 38-year-old woman from Pennsauken in Camden
County are the fifth and sixth state residents to test positive for the
mosquito-borne disease this year, said Laura Otterbourg, spokeswoman for
the New Jersey Department of Health and Senior Services. The 2 were
hospitalized, treated, and discharged. Both were most likely bitten by an
infected mosquito in mid-to-late August, Otterbourg said. Final
confirmation of the cases will be made by the federal Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention in a few weeks, she said.
The Newark man was admitted to St. Michael's Medical Center on 23 Aug 2001
with symptoms of West Nile fever, including fever, muscle weakness, and
confusion. The Pennsauken woman developed symptoms, including fever and
headache, on 20 Sep 2001, and was admitted to Kennedy Health System's
Cherry Hill Campus hospital. She is receiving physical therapy on an
outpatient basis.
The first human case of West Nile in New Jersey this year was a 72-year-old
Bergenfield woman, who was reported to have recovered. West Nile
encephalitis normally causes flu-like symptoms, but can result in brain
inflammation in the elderly and in people with weakened immune systems.
West Nile has killed 8 people in the metropolitan area, including an
82-year-old Little Falls man last year, since the virus first appeared in
North America in 1999. There have been no human deaths from West Nile this
year in New Jersey or New York.
The disease is spread to humans by the bite of mosquitoes that feed on
infected dead birds, particularly crows. To date this year, 995 dead crows
found in 20 counties have tested positive for West Nile virus. This
includes 106 crows in Bergen County, 38 crows in Passaic, and 30 in Morris.
Monmouth County tops the list with 167 infected crows.
"With cooler weather and shorter days, there is a reduced risk of West Nile
virus infection at this time of year," said the acting New Jersey health
commissioner, Dr. George T. DiFerdinando. However, residents should take
precautions to avoid mosquito bites until the first hard frost occurs in
their area, DiFerdinando said.
