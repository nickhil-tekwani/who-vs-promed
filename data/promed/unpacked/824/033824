Space Shuttle Cleared in Illness of Livestock
---------------------------------------------
Animal health officials investigating the reported illness in 3 cows in
Cherokee County have found no evidence of a relationship between the
illness and the Columbia space shuttle disaster. More than 600 pieces of
shuttle material have been found in Cherokee County. The investigation by
veterinarians from the Texas Animal Health Commission (TAHC) and NASA began
7 Feb 2003, after 3 cows on separate premises exhibited swelling of the
tongue and head. 2 of the cows died, and samples were collected for testing
at the Texas Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory at College Station.
Blood samples were taken from the remaining cow. In addition, several
pen-raised deer in the same area were reported to have stiff and swollen
necks after the shuttle disaster.
"Autopsies on the 2 dead cows were suggestive of pneumonia, with bacterial
complications. A third cow is recovering," said Dr. James Lenarduzzi,
acting executive director for the TAHC, the state's regulatory agency for
livestock and poultry health. "The 2 deer recovered fully after being
administered anti-inflammatory drugs. The deer may have sustained an injury
when they were startled by the noise of the shuttle breakup, or when
shuttle material fell into their pen."
"We routinely work with private veterinary practitioners and producers when
unusual death losses or signs of illnesses occur," commented Dr. Max
Coats, TAHC assistant executive director. "In this instance, concerns were
raised because it was not clear whether the animals might have developed an
adverse health response after contact with shuttle material. We were
relieved to find that the cattle had not died from a hazardous chemical
substance or an exotic disease."
"We want to hear from livestock and poultry owners and private veterinary
practitioners if unusual death losses occur or signs of illness are
exhibited," said Dr. Lenarduzzi. "We operate a 24-hour hotline at
1-800-550-8242. A regulatory veterinarian is on call at all times to take
reports and initiate a disease investigation.
