South Korea's public health authorities have confirmed that the "water tanks of portable toilets" were the reason behind an outbreak of norovirus [infection] at the PyeongChang Winter Olympics that affected around 300 security personnel for the event last month [February 2018].

The authorities announced on Sun [18 Mar 2018] that according to the results of the epidemiological investigation of Horeb Youth Camp Center and other related facilities, the water tanks of mobile toilets [were found to be the source of] the norovirus infection. According to the investigation, the genotype of the virus detected in water tanks matched that of patients. Around 570 portable lavatories had been set up during the Olympic period, and water used to wash hands or brush teeth before leaving a toilet for the sake of hygiene was the culprit of infection.

Water tanks had contained underground water from the Gangwon region. It is likely that the toilets' water tanks and septic tanks had not been properly separated, according to the authorities. Norovirus is usually spread through water contaminated with the feces of the infected.

Upon confirmation of the cause, the authorities cleaned up and sterilized all water tanks and replaced 5 aged toilets. Since such actions were taken, only 6 people have tested positive for norovirus during the PyeongChang Paralympics, nearly the lowest number of infections ever reported during the Paralympic period.

Beyond the lodgings of security personnel, another reason behind the infection was nearby restaurants. Twelve female police officers at the squad of the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency who stayed at Gangneung Youngdong University were confirmed to have the symptoms of norovirus after eating sweet and sour Korean chicken and buckwheat noodles at a famous nearby restaurant. Also, 4 Swiss athletes reportedly had the symptoms after eating slices of raw trout at a restaurant in the vicinity. The total number of infections since 2 Feb 2018 was 324, according to the joint countermeasures headquarters.

[See earlier posts on norovirus at the Olympics.

Norovirus is typically spread via contaminated food or water, close contact with an infected patient, or by touching contaminated surfaces or objects. Virus spread is difficult to control, and it can survive outside the body for several days. There is no specific medical treatment following infection, although doctors advise people to drink a lot of fluids to avoid dehydration and wash hands frequently. The irony in this outbreak is that handwashing contributed to it. It is good that the source is known, so precautions can be taken to prevent such contamination in the future.
