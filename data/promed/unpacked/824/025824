Massive deaths of saiga antelopes [known as "saigak") have been recorded on Sat [7 Sep 2013] in Akmola and Karaganda oblasts.

"There are about 3000 reported deaths (according to preliminary information) within the Betpak-Dala saiga population. Of these, about 1500 individuals have been found on the southern, western, and northern shores of Lake Tengiz.

"Fallen antelopes are found in the lowland and steppe areas," says a report released by the country's Ministry of Environment (MEP).

The Ministry's Committee for Forestry and Hunting, in cooperation with the staff of the Karaganda NIS of Kazakh Scientific Research Veterinary Institute for Biosafety problems has conducted a survey at the locations of the saiga mortality and measures have been taken to establish the extent and causes of the event.

About 1000 saiga are known to have died in the Kostanay region [Northwest Kazakhstan] from infectious diseases (pasteurellosis) in the spring of 2012. In 2011, a massive loss of saiga was recorded in western Kazakhstan, killing more than 12 000 animals, presumably from pasteurellosis and overeating, according to IA "Kazakh-Grain."

Kazakhstan's saiga antelopes form about 90 percent of the species world population. According to the Ministry of Agriculture counts, their number has increased to 145 000. In 2010 it was 85 500 and in 2011, 102 200. The most terrible years for these rare animals were 80 years of the last century, when -- in April 1984 -- in the Ural region, 250 000 died due to the illness pasteurellosis and in May 1988, 434 000 died in the Turgay steppes.

There is a ban on the killing [hunting] of saiga antelopes in Kazakhstan until the year 2020. However, the main threat of animal poaching remains. Since the beginning of 2012, 4 poaching incidents have been recorded with 71 animals killed.

The annual State's expenditure for the protection of the saiga antelopes in Kazakhstan is 125 million tenge (about USD 800 000). The study of mass mortality of saiga in Kazakhstan has been undertaken by employees of the Karaganda NIS of Kazakh Scientific Research Veterinary Institute for Bio-safety problems. According to them, this insidious saiga disease, attributed to pasteurellosis, is still not thoroughly understood.

Mortality from pasteurellosis in the saiga is quite high. Death occurs within a few hours. It is thus difficult to observe the signs in a sick animal, and rather impossible to carry out effective disinfection. In the wild, the antelopes themselves are carriers of pasteurellosis.

[One of the causes of past mass mortalities of saiga antelopes (known in the former USSR as "Saigak") in Kazakhstan was foot-mouth-disease (FMD). During a major outbreak in the late 1960's, the disease reportedly spread along the north-south annual migration route of the animals, at that time counting several hundred thousands. Among the signs observed was the loss of horns and hooves, and considerable mortality (Ref 1). Experimental infection with FMDV caused up to 75 percent mortality; up to 10 percent of the free-living population reportedly died during natural outbreaks (Ref 2).

The description above of 1500 animals found dead along the shores of Lake Tengiz, is reminiscent of the situation observed in northern Israel in 1985, when -- during a mass FMD-O epizootic killing more than 2000 _Gazella gazellae_ antelopes (more than 60 percent of the population), most dying animals were observed along water sources in a state of dehydration (unable to drink). Laboratory investigations revealed (secondary) pneumonia with _Pasteurella_ in several cases. Sudden death of ruminants, due to cardiac changes caused by FMD virus, is a long-known phenomenon.

FMDV serotype A has reportedly been identified earlier this year (2013) in cattle in East Kazakhstan. FMD deserves to be included among the infectious and non-infectious agents addressed by the investigators in the affected saigak. Results will be appreciated.
