The city of Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire can once again be considered safe
from a yellow fever epidemic after the national Ministry of Health,
the World Health Organization (WHO), UNICEF [United Nations
Children's Fund] nongovernmental organizations and others in the
Yellow Fever Partnership combined their forces to vaccinate over 2.2
million people in the Ivorian capital.

In a campaign, which lasted 14 days and finished on Fri 5 Sep [2008],
vaccine financed by the GAVI Alliance [formerly The Global Alliance
for Vaccines and Immunization] was distributed to points across the
capital, and administered by trained health teams.

By ensuring that over 2.2 million non-vaccinated people out of a
total population of approximately 5 million in the capital received
their yellow fever (YF) vaccination, YF vaccination coverage rates
were brought up to levels in the city where the entire population can
be expected to be protected against epidemics.

It is estimated that at least 60-80 percent of a given population has
to be vaccinated for epidemics to be obviated in the entire
population. Prior to this vaccination campaign, the last YF
vaccination campaign in Abidjan had taken place in 2001, achieving a
coverage rate above 90 percent. But vaccination coverage rates were
estimated to have slipped down to 60 percent in the intervening
years, due to population movements and births.

"This was a team effort from start to finish. The GAVI Alliance
financed the vaccine and equipment, the International Coordinating
Group for Yellow Fever provided the vaccine, the Ministry of Health
provided the manpower, logistics and participated economically to
cover 50 percent of the operational costs and above all the will to
stop this urban outbreak in its tracks, and local and international
organizations contributed their time and expertise to ensure that all
steps in the process were completed successfully. As a result we have
now protected a major urban centre -- and perhaps larger areas --
against the possibility of an epidemic," said Dr Yada Adamou, WHO's
African Regional Focal Point for Epidemic and Pandemic Alert and
Response.

This emergency campaign comes as the Yellow Fever Initiative, with
[USD] 58 million worth of support from GAVI, is continuing its mass
vaccination programmes across West Africa aimed at drastically
reducing the numbers at risk from yellow fever. So far, 3 countries
-- Mali, Senegal, and Togo -- have undertaken national preventive
vaccination campaigns as part of the Initiative, with other countries
due to follow suit as soon as sufficient vaccine is available.

"Vaccination is instrumental in preventing cases and epidemics of
this killer disease," said Dr Nina Schwalbe, deputy executive
secretary at the GAVI Alliance. "With the Yellow Fever Initiative,
affected countries like Cote d'Ivoire have an exceptional
opportunity, and responsibility, to protect their populations. GAVI
is committed to working with all our partners, both globally and in
the field, to bring life-saving vaccines to the populations at risk."

Yellow fever is an acute, haemorrhagic, viral disease -- transmitted
to humans by infected mosquitoes. Infection may result in no illness,
or illness may range from mild to severe; 20-50 percent of those
with severe illness will die of the disease. There is no known
specific antiviral therapy against YF, although the disease can be
prevented by the YF vaccine, which provides immunity for at least 10
years.

Because of its severity, even a single case is a public health
concern. Yellow fever is endemic in tropical regions of Africa and
South America where 47 countries (33 in Africa and 14 in South
America) are considered at risk.

The 12 countries taking part on the Yellow Fever Initiative are
Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, Guinea, Liberia,
Mali, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, and Togo.

The ministries of Health of these 12 countries are being supported
financially and technically by a Yellow Fever partnership which was
launched in February 2006 and now includes WHO, UNICEF, GAVI,
Medecins Sans Frontieres [MSF], IFRC [International Federation of Red
Cross and Red Crescent Societies], the Association pour la Medecine
Preventive (AMP), the Programme for Appropriate Technology (PATH),
the European Union Humanitarian Aid Office (ECHO), the United States
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Global Outbreak
Alert and Response Network (GOARN), and the Institut Pasteur. The
partnership continues to take on new members.

[The YF Partnership and especially the Cote d'Ivoire Ministry of
Health are to be congratulated for their response to the YF
outbreak in Abidjan, preventing what could have developed into a
major YF epidemic. This effort to vaccinate the susceptible
population provides a good example for the YF at-risk countries in
Africa and South America, as did a similar response to urban YF
in Paraguay earlier in 2008.
