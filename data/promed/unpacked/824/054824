I doubt that there is much unsuspected "airport malaria" in non-endemic
countries because asymptomatic malaria is so rare in non-immune
humans (unlike some strains of inbred mice!). If unsuspected therefore it
would have to be in:
- semi-immunes (of whom there would be few in non-endemic countries), or in
- people treated empirically with a drug having anti-malarial activity such
as doxycycline, or in
- people dying of an undiagnosed febrile disease without autopsy (probably
rare in young people in countries like Australia but common in the elderly
with other illness).
There may be unreported cases.
In disease endemic countries it is probably a frequent event for mosquitoes
to travel by airplane.
[I would think that a case of malaria, presenting as fever in a resident of
a non-malarious country with no history of travel to a malarious area, would
frequently be unsuspected, unrecognised and incorrectly diagnosed, even if
the fever was cyclical or relapsing - Mod.JW
