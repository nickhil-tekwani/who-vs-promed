A 66-year-old woman went to Malawi for 2 weeks (8-day safari). She visited several parks, which she does not recall the names of, but she does remember seeing a lot of tsetse flies when opening the car window to take pictures of the elephants at the Vwasa park near Rumphi.

On 17 Nov 2018 she returned to the Netherlands. On 18 Nov 2018 a chancre was observed on her back. She did not recall any insect bites. On 19 Nov 2018 she developed fever (39 deg C/102 deg F), and in the evening of 20 Nov 2018 she was seen at the emergency room of the Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam, with fever, headache, and intermittent vomiting but no neurological symptoms. Lab results showed mild thrombopenia (140 000) and C-reactive protein level of 40 as the only abnormalities. The presence of mobile trypanosomes were clearly visible in the blood of the patient.

Suramin was not available in the Netherlands or at the tropical institute in Antwerp [Belgium]. The WHO was contacted but informed us that medication can be ordered during office hours only. Therefore, the tropical institute of Basel [Switzerland] was contacted and supplied suramin. While waiting for the suramin to arrive, intravenous pentamidine was given.

[ProMED thanks Drs. Mariana de Mendonca Melo and Bart Rijnders for reporting this case, which again shows that Malawi is endemic for African trypanosomiasis. The Vwasa wildlife reserve and Nyika National Park are close together in northern Malawi (http://www.malawitourism.com/pages/attractions/the_attraction.asp?AttractionsID=10). More information on African trypanosomiasis can be found at the Programme Against African Trypanosomiasis (PAAT): http://www.fao.org/ag/againfo/programmes/en/paat/home.html. - Mod.EP
