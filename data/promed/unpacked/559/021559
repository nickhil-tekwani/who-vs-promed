An outbreak of ovine Johnes disease (OJD) at a commercial sheep farm on
Kangaroo Island in South Australia has been clinically diagnosed.
Laboratory confirmation is expected shortly.
OJD was first detected in New South Wales in 1980. This case, which may
lead to the slaughter of about 4000 sheep, is the second in South Australia
during the past two years. The first case involved a ram transported into
the state from the eastern part
of the continent.
