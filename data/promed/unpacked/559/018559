[1] Guinea: 3 doctors infected
Date: 17 Mar 2015
Source: The Herald [edited]
http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/world-news/three-doctors-infected-as-ebola-cases-rise-in-guinea.120890957


Guinea has suffered a setback in its fight against Ebola with a rash of new cases, including 3 doctors infected by the virus, with officials blaming weak surveillance and a failure to follow safety procedures.

The outbreak, which began in eastern Guinea more than a year ago and has killed over 10 000 people in the 3 West African countries worst hit, had appeared to be on the wane, but Guinea has seen cases rise for 3 consecutive weeks, according to World Health Organization data.

A government health report from the weekend showed there were 21 new cases in a single day, a spike from the recent daily average of 8. One big source of concern is a chain of new infections that can be linked back to a woman who died of Ebola and was not buried safely, according to Fatoumata Lejeune-Kaba, spokeswoman for the U.N.'s Ebola emergency response mission UNMEER.

"It's a major setback .... It's due to individual behaviours. That is having a devastating effect on the community. People are simply not practising the safety rules that we have been talking about for a year," she told Reuters.

Of the other 2 countries worst hit, Sierra Leone has also seen a spate of new cases while Liberia has no known cases at present and is waiting to be declared free of the disease.

The new cases in Guinea are in the capital and the southwestern town of Forecariah but if the situation is not brought under control it could spread across borders, said Lejeune-Kaba. A spokesman for Guinea's anti-Ebola task force, said new cases came from high risk Ebola contacts who had left Forecariah and developed symptoms elsewhere, pointing to poor surveillance. "There are numerous gaps in the Ebola response in Guinea, notably in surveillance of contacts, and that explains the difficulty in making any lasting progress towards ending the epidemic," said a spokesman for medical charity MSF [Medecins Sans Frontieres].

The 3 doctors were infected at the Ignace Deen hospital in Conakry, which is not an Ebola centre. More than 50 doctors in Guinea have caught the virus during the outbreak. A source in the health ministry said infections at the Conakry hospital were due to a "lack of vigilance," saying staff had been told to protect themselves.

President Alpha Conde says he hopes to get to 0 Ebola cases by mid-April 2015, ahead of elections planned for October [2015]. Setbacks in the campaign against Ebola might delay investment into Guinea's underdeveloped natural resources.

[This flare-up in the number of cases highlights the role of traditional cultural behaviors in sustaining the epidemic. Education is badly needed to counteract these practices. Proper burial procedures following death of infected individuals is critical, yet must be acceptable to the population. Similarly, surveillance and adherence to safety protocols must be maintained. As has been stated repeatedly, the outbreak will not be over until there are 0 cases. And even then, education and surveillance, as well as the health infrastructure, must continue to receive support. - Mod.LK]

21 evacuated after security breach at Port Loko Ebola treatment facility
-------------------------
Dr. Eskild Petersen participated in an evacuation of 3 Danish health care workers (HCW), exposed to the index case employed by the NGO Partners in Health, PIH, mentioned in the ProMED Ebola posting Sun 15 March 2015 (ProMED mail Ebola update (49): USA ex Sierra Leone, contacts, susp 20150315.3232265.

The 3 Danish HCWs we evacuated had all been in contact with the index case, and so far all 3 remain healthy and were released Sun 15 Mar 2015 from the hospital for further observation at home [Denmark].

According to the information we received, 10 US staff and 5 UK staff had left Freetown before us and they were expecting a 2nd flight from the US to evacuate further 3 PIH staff to the US a few hours after us; we left Freetown Sun morning 15 Mar 2015 at 5:30.

There has been 1 more confirmed EBV case in a local HCW working at the Port Loko facility.

Fri [13 Mar 2015] evening 23:30 the PIH facility was abandoned by the PIH staff and the patients transferred without notice to the rest of the facility at Port Loko. If the treatment facility at Port Loko had been a village with 2 confirmed cases and many contacts, it would have been quarantined. However, officials from the CDC and WHO informed the staff that the facility could not be closed, but it was unclear how the staff should handle the situation, potentially with numerous staff in contact with the EBV cases within the facility.

To add to the confusion the local WHO [not HQ Geneva] introduced a new risk classification "higher risk," in addition to the previous "low" and "high" risk classification, which has confused matters. For instance our 3 HCWs received the "higher risk" classification according to the local WHO representative even though they had used gloves and had only been in contact with the index case before he developed fever.

[The number of evacuees who had contact with the index case, a health care (HC) worker with PIH, appears to be increasing regularly. See 16 Mar 2015 report below on a 7th health-care worker (from the same facility where the USA HC-worker contracted Ebola) who was flown back to the UK following suspected Ebola contact. This patient remains asymptomatic. See 17 Mar 2015 report below stating there are now 15 health care workers who have been evacuated to the US who had contact with the index case.

Information is requested on
-- how the index case HC worker became infected,
-- the circumstances of exposure of the contacts,
-- which vaccine -- if any -- the index case was given during treatment (as mentioned in the report in ProMED mail Ebola update (49): USA ex Sierra Leone, contacts, susp 20150315.3232265)

We hope for his full recovery and that no additional cases occur. - Mod.LK]
