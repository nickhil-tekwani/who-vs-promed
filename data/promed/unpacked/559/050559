[1] Albertan swine virus sequenced
Date: Fri 15 May 2009

Scientists at the Canadian Food Inspection Agency's (CFIA) National
Centre for Foreign Animal Disease (NCFAD) have mapped the full
genetic sequence of the virus found in swine from Alberta, a
development that will help scientists around the world better
understand the virus and its affects on animals.

Influenza viruses do not affect the safety of properly handled and
cooked pork. In close collaboration with their colleagues at Canada's
National Microbiology Laboratory, CFIA scientists now have a complete
picture of the virus detected in swine on an Alberta farm. This
validates early test results and confirms that the virus found in the
pigs is the same as the virus causing illness in humans around the
world. The CFIA will share the diagnostic methods developed to
identify the novel H1N1 influenza in swine with provinces and
territories, international agencies and other countries to facilitate
surveillance and detection activities.

Researchers are now focusing on how the H1N1 flu virus affects swine.
Although more study is needed, early observations suggest that
infected animals become sick and recover naturally, just as they
would if exposed to influenza viruses commonly seen in swine herds at
a global level. Ongoing CFIA research is examining whether or not
other animals are susceptible to the virus. This information may be
used to refine disease prevention and control measures. Studies are
also underway to assess the effectiveness of current vaccines and to
develop better and faster diagnostic methods.

[The completion of this analysis confirms that the novel 2009 strain
of A (H1N1) influenza virus was responsible for the outbreak of
disease in pigs in an Albertan farm following their exposure to a
farm worker carrying the novel strain of virus. Fortunately, the
transmission of infection to the pigs has not resulted, so far as is
known, in onward transmission to other humans on the farm, and the
pigs were only mildly affected. - Mod.CP]

[2] Clarification and comment
Date: Mon 18 May 2009
From: Richard Irvine <r.irvine@vla.defra.gsi.gov.uk>


Following the publication of the abbreviated and edited version of
the article "Novel H1N1 influenza in people: global spread from an
animal source?" (Irvine R.M. and Brown I.H, 2009. Veterinary Record
164:577-578) in the ProMED post of 16 May 2009 (Influenza A (H1N1) -
worldwide (31), archive number 20090516.1835), we would like to make
the following observation:

On 2 occasions, the edited version of the article incorrectly states
that the "new variant of H1N1 virus contains 3 of 8 gene segments
(encoding for the neuraminidase and matrix protein genes) that do not
appear typical of the genes seen in current North American strains."

We would like to clarify further that the original published article
referred, on each occasion, to the novel H1N1 influenza virus having
"2 of 8 gene segments (encoding for the neuraminidase and matrix
protein genes) that do not appear typical of the genes seen in
current North American strains."

The full, unedited version of the article can be accessed at:
<http://veterinaryrecord.bvapublications.com/cgi/content/full/164/19/577>.

The Veterinary Laboratories Agency (VLA) website at
<http://www.defra.gov.uk/vla/diseases/dis_si.htm> also details
further VLA information regarding swine influenza and surveillance
for swine influenza in Great Britain as well as links to other
veterinary and public health organization websites.

[3] Indiscriminate use of Tamiflu
Date: Mon 18 May 2009
From: Julian Tang <jwtang49@hotmail.com>


With the recent explosion of A(H1N1/2009) cases in Japan, it will
probably be prudent to monitor for Tamiflu (oseltamivir) resistance.
One Roche representative in Hong Kong told me that Japan accounts for
about 70 percent of the world's use of Tamiflu (even before avian
H5N1 and the new H1N1/2009 viruses appeared). Thus, if Tamiflu
resistance occurs with this new A(H1N1/2009) virus anywhere, it may
well 1st happen in Japan. Also, a language barrier may delay this revelation.

However, now Tamiflu is used in many countries (particularly in
Europe) in patients for whom it was previously not recommended (i.e.
otherwise healthy adults with no underlying chronic disease or
immuno-suppression with uncomplicated infection with seasonal
influenza virus) to try to curtail the onward transmission of this
new A(H1N1/2009) virus.

So, if this continues, ironically, maybe the rest of the world will
catch up with Japan as a potential source of Tamiflu resistance. This
policy may be counter-productive in that if this fails to control the
spread of this virus, then in those who eventually need Tamiflu for
serious illness (if the feared more lethal 2nd wave of the pandemic
does actually appear), it may be ineffective.

[Dr Tang identifies an important issue, namely whereas the widespread
use of Tamiflu with the aim of disrupting the transmission of the
novel strain of H1N1 influenza virus is fully justified,
indiscriminate use of Tamiflu in non-urgent situations may hasten the
evolution of Tamiflu-resistant strains. Many, but not all, healthcare
agencies are aware of this possibility. Fortunately, in the case of
seasonal influenza strains, Tamiflu-resistance has not always been
accompanied by cross-resistance to the other currently available
neuraminidase inhibitor, Relenza. - Mod.CP]
