A number of flu cases reported recently in Libya have been found to be of the type H1N1 [influenza] virus that leads to death when not treated properly, the director of the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), Dr Mohamed Aboughalia, told journalists in Tripoli on Tuesday morning [12 Mar 2013].

Infected cases so far have reached 29. Five deaths have been reported, including one in Tripoli, one in Zawia, and 3 in Darna in eastern Libya. Infected cases have been distributed in Libyan cities: 6 in Darna, 2 in Benghazi, 3 in Baiyda, one in Marj, 3 in Misurata, 2 in Khums, 10 in Tripoli, and 2 in Zawia. Three cases in Tripoli have been diagnosed as being infected with the H1N1 [influenza] virus, while the remaining cases are being tested.

Aboughalia also said that the health authorities were prepared to respond to the situation, and the cases have been isolated to protect the rest of the population from getting in contact with the virus. He said Tamiflu medicine and spray ampoules have been distributed to all NCDC branches in the country.

Influenza A (H1N1) virus is the subtype of influenza A virus that was the most common cause of human influenza (flu) in 2009. Some strains of H1N1 are endemic in humans and cause a small fraction of all influenza-like illness and a small fraction of all seasonal influenza. H1N1 strains caused a small percentage of all human flu infections in 2004-2005. Other strains of H1N1 are endemic in pigs (swine influenza) and in birds (avian influenza).

In June 2009, the World Health Organization declared the new strain of swine-origin H1N1 as a pandemic. This strain is often called swine flu by the public media. This novel virus spread worldwide and had caused about 17 000 deaths by the start of 2010. On 10 Aug 2010, WHO declared the H1N1 influenza pandemic over, saying worldwide flu activity had returned to typical seasonal patterns.

[Previously, it was suggested in archived ProMED-mail post: "Undiagnosed deaths - Libya: RFI, H1N1 susp. 20130313.1584077" that: "It also appears there are concerns that some of the severe respiratory deaths outside Tripoli may not be due to H1N1 [influenza] but rather due to the novel coronavirus (nCoV) known to be affecting individuals elsewhere in the Middle East sporadically." While the current diagnoses of influenza A(H1N1) virus infection have only been confirmed for a proportion of the patients, there is no evidence to confirm involvement of the new coronavirus in this outbreak of respiratory illness. - Mod.CP
