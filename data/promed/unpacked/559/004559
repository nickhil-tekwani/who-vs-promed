A 2nd case of anthrax in a bull-calf has been registered in the Kursk
region [a previous case was reported on ProMED-mail on 11 Jan 2005; see
reference below - Corr.NP].
Kursk resident ShChigry Kurkogo killed an 11-month old bull-calf to sell
its meat in the local market. However the analyses carried out by the local
veterinary laboratory [detected the anthrax bacillus]. The Kursk laboratory
has confirmed the veterinary diagnosis.
According to the Kursk area administration press office, the meat and hide
from the animal have been destroyed using all precautions. Disinfection of
the owner's yard has been carried out. All [livestock] along the street
where the bull-calf lived, including a cow and 36 pigs, have been
vaccinated and now are under constant veterinary supervision.
People in contact with the sick animal have passed a course of special
treatment [vaccination - Corr.NP]. But experts are disturbed that the
infected bull-calf had been vaccinated against anthrax twice. All
[remaining batches of the] vaccine have been sent to the Scientific
Research Institute in Moscow [branch not specified - Corr.NP] for testing.

[The Kursk region is located in the center of the European part of Russia,
at the convergence of transport lines from Russia to industrial areas of
Ukraine and the Caucasus. In the north, the region borders on Bryansk, in
the east with Oryol and Lipetsk, in the south with Voronezh and Belgorod,
and in the West with Ukraine. The total area of region is 29.8 thousand sq
km and the population is 1 235 600. - Corr.NP]
[It is interesting that this 2nd case was a bull-calf, like the 1st. As it
is now mid-winter, we can safely presume that both animals were housed and
being fed a commercial calf feed and hay. This is also a different village
from the 1st report, all of which points to distributed contaminated calf
feed. If dairy cows had been involved, there would have been many more
reports. Anthrax in calves is seldom reported, mainly because in the normal
summer "anthrax" season they will be suckling and grazing lightly.
The apparent non-functionality of their vaccine is worrisome. The Russian
livestock vaccines are usually very good, but one can get poor batches. The
other possibility is that the animal for some reason was getting
antibiotics at the time it was vaccinated and this killed the live vaccine.
This scenario is not at all unknown and unfortunately too common. - Mod.MHJ]
