As of [Fri 11 Aug 2017], there have been a total of:
1697 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection, including
686 deaths [reported case fatality rate 40.4 per cent],
989 recoveries, and
22 currently active cases/infections.

[As previously mentioned, the numbers of deaths, recoveries, and currently active cases come from my spreadsheet tallies and differ from those listed on the Saudi MOH website; my spreadsheet counts asymptomatic infections. One complication is the reporting of cases as either recoveries or deaths that cannot be confirmed as previously reported newly confirmed cases. - Mod.MPP]

Since the last ProMED-mail update [Tue 8 Aug 2017], there have been a total of:
2 newly confirmed cases
1 newly reported fatality, and
0 newly reported recoveries.

Information on newly reported cases/infections (2 cases/infections):
- both from Dawmat Alijandal [Al Jawf region]
- both males
- both expats
- both healthcare workers
- both in stable condition having been identified as asymptomatic contacts of previously confirmed MERS-CoV infected individuals
- both classified as secondary healthcare acquired cases in healthcare workers

One aged 55 years, the other aged 52 years.

Information on newly reported fatality (1 fatality)
- A 70-year-old Saudi male, non-healthcare worker from Dawmat Aljandal [Al Jawf region] with a history of pre-existing co-morbidities [reported as a newly confirmed case on 8 Aug 2017, at which time he was noted to be in critical condition. Classified as a secondary healthcare acquired case in a patient. - Mod.MPP].
