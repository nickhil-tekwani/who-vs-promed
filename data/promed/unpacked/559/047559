South African officials may be interested in reviewing a Canadian investigation into a major listeriosis outbreak in Canada in 2008. See "Report of the independent investigator into the 2008 listeriosis outbreak, July 2009," Government of Canada at http://publications.gc.ca/collections/collection_2009/agr/A22-508-2009E.pdf.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Monir Taha for drawing our attention to the very relevant "Report of the Independent Investigator into the 2008 Listeriosis Outbreak, July 2009."

The report evaluates the response to a multi-province outbreak of listeriosis that involved a total of 57 laboratory-confirmed cases, of which 30 were fatal. _Listeria_-contaminated deli meat from a single producer at a Toronto processing plant was eventually found to be the source. A commercial meat slicer, the design of which made its regular cleaning difficult and costly for the food processor, contaminated the deli meat products. The contamination occurred in parts of the machinery "well beyond the [manufacturer's] recommended sanitation process" and was "found only after the devices were completely disassembled" (https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/maple-leaf-eyes-meat-slicers-in-outbreak/article1060898/). The contaminated ready-to eat meat products were distributed to institutions that included hospitals and long-term care homes, where ready-to eat meat products were served to vulnerable populations. Of the 57 cases, 54 were elderly people in hospitals and long-term care homes. Cultures at the processing plant were positive for _Listeria_ for months before the outbreak started, and authorities weren't alerted to suspect the plant's deli meats for more than 2 months after the outbreak began. ProMED-mail reported on this outbreak in several posts in 2008 and one in 2009 (see also's below).

The following is extracted from the Executive Summary of the "Report of the independent investigator into the 2008 listeriosis outbreak, July 2009." Interested readers are encouraged to access the full report at http://publications.gc.ca/collections/collection_2009/agr/A22-508-2009E.pdf.

"1. The focus on food safety among senior management in both the public and private domains.
Our key findings are:
Maple Leaf Foods
----------------
- Maple Leaf Foods' Bartor Road plant was aware that it had occurrences of _Listeria_ in the plant in 2007 and 2008, and tried to correct the problem with sanitation procedures standard in the industry. The plant's management thought _Listeria_ was under control. (Chap 5, Rec 5, 15 a to d)

- Maple Leaf Foods did not conduct the trend analysis required under its _Listeria_ control policy. The recurring positive results were not known nor were the positive results verified to determine the presence/absence of _L. monocytogenes_. At the same time, the company was producing larger packages of deli-meat products for sale to institutions, including hospitals and long-term care homes. They had created a recipe that used less sodium, which was attractive to the institutional market as many of its clients benefited from reduced-sodium diets. This combination of circumstances exposed vulnerable populations to risk. (Chap 5, Rec 15 e, 21)

- Maple Leaf Foods staff notified their superiors of the repeated presence of _Listeria_ beyond the Bartor Road plant into the Head Office. However, this information did not reach the office of the Chief Executive Officer because it was thought that the plant's interventions had controlled the problem. (Chap 5, Rec 1)

- Employees in the Maple Leaf Foods Bartor Road plant were not required to, nor did they volunteer, information concerning the repeated occurrences of _Listeria_ in the plant to the CFIA Inspectors. (Chap 5, Rec 6)

Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA)
--------------------------------------
- A new federal inspection approach, the Compliance Verification System (CVS), was put into effect in the spring of 2008, at the same time Maple Leaf Foods' environmental testing was identifying _Listeria_ at the Bartor Road plant (Chap 5, Rec 10)

- Although the CVS is regarded as a sound system and has broad support, it needs critical improvements related to its design, planning, and implementation. (Chap 5, Rec 10)

- The CFIA inspectors had no obligation to request or examine the company's _Listeria_ testing results under their CVS tasks. (Chap 5, Rec 20)

- In the lead-up to the outbreak the number, capacity, and training of inspectors assigned to Maple Leaf Foods Bartor Road plant appear to have been stressed due to their responsibilities at other plants, the complexity of the Bartor Road plant, including its size and hours of operation, and necessary adjustments required by the implementation of the CVS. (Chap 5, Rec 7)

- Due to the lack of detailed information and differing views heard, the investigation was not able to determine the current level of resources as well as the resources needed to conduct the CVS activities effectively. For the same reason, we were also unable to come to a conclusion concerning the adequacy of the program design, implementation plan, training and supervision of inspectors, as well as oversight and performance monitoring. (Chap 5, Rec 7)

- The latest CFIA _Listeria_ controls do not distinguish between foods at much lower risk of harbouring _Listeria_ (such as dried sausages) and those that are much higher risk (such as hot-dogs). Furthermore, they do not establish 'test and hold' product controls. (Chap 5, Rec 15 d)

- There is a need for increased coordination and improved communication about food processing equipment among the manufacturer, the food processor, and the CFIA regarding design specifications and the validation of sanitation procedures. (Chap 5, Rec 14)

Health Canada
-------------
- The Health Canada _L. monocytogenes_ policy (currently under review) does not provide adequate direction on expected outcomes leaving room for interpretation by industry. The lack of integration with the CFIA policies creates gaps and overlaps. (Chap 5, Rec 11)

- In approving food additives and technologies, Health Canada has not been taking into account food safety considerations when assigning priorities or fast-tracking for approval these substances and processes. (Chap 5, Rec 12)

Multi-jurisdictional emergency response
---------------------------------------
National foodborne outbreaks are rare in Canada. Nevertheless, the Foodborne Illness Outbreak Response Protocol (FIORP) and complementary agreements are in place to manage such events but they were not widely known or understood by senior leadership at the time of the 2008 outbreak. (Chap 5, Rec 24)

"2. The state of readiness of the various governments.
Our key findings are:
Multi-jurisdictional emergency response
---------------------------------------
- The 2008 outbreak first emerged in Ontario and was therefore under provincial leadership.

- At the outset, the outbreak was not considered a severe foodborne emergency. This led to a void in leadership in managing the crisis. It took close to 3 weeks before senior executives in all key organizations became fully engaged in the event. (Chap 7, Rec 24 b-i)

- The protocol (FIORP), which is in need of updating, was not recognized as the protocol to be used. The lack of a clear understanding about which organization or level of government was responsible for doing what -- including which organization should lead the response to the crisis -- contributed to the inconsistent management of the outbreak. Few of those involved in the 2008 outbreak, especially senior executives, were familiar with the FIORP. (Chap 7, Rec 24)

- Since national foodborne illness outbreaks of this magnitude are rare in Canada, opportunities to practice this emergency management approach are very limited. (Chap 7, Rec 24 c)

- Public health labs are not formally networked and could be more effectively used during a foodborne illness emergency. (Chap 7, Rec 33)

- The Public Health Agency of Canada is making headway in epidemiological data collection and analysis in cases of human illness (such as H1N1), but improvements are still required in integrating the data collection, and analysis, of food samples (such as listeriosis). (Chap 7, Rec 35 c)

- Enhanced coordination of various testing (such as cross-coding of human and food samples linked to the same patient) could further accelerate the analysis and decision-making necessary in the management of foodborne emergencies. (Chap 7, Rec 35 a)

- Based on our investigation, to maintain confidence in the food safety system, there is a need for independent review after all national foodborne emergencies, in addition to each organization's lessons learned review. (Chap 7, rec 27)

- Most organizations involved in the response to the 2008 outbreak had very limited pre-planned surge capacity. (Chap 7, Rec 24 b-iii and 34 b)

"3. The sense of urgency at the outset of the outbreak.
Our key findings are:
Maple Leaf Foods
----------------
- Maple Leaf Foods did not initially report the presence of _Listeria_ at the Bartor Road plant or provide product distribution records. (Chap 5, Rec 6)
Public Health Agency of Canada

Public Health Agency of Canada
-------------------------------
The Public Health Agency of Canada did not consider it had the federal leadership role, therefore there was a delay in identifying the outbreak as a public health emergency. (Chap 7, Rec 24 b-i)

Health Canada
-------------
- Health Canada's Health Risk Assessment team was not operating on a 24/7 basis during the summer of 2008, leaving gaps in coverage during the response to the emergency. (Chap 9, Appendix C)

Public health and food safety sectors
-------------------------------------
- There are differing views on the quality of evidence needed to advise the public about potential food contamination and/or to recall the food product. Some advocate specific laboratory confirmation to ensure the correct product is removed from the market. Others advocate for a precautionary approach, based on epidemiological evidence, to protect the public from potential harm. (Chap 7, Rec 24 b-iv, 29)

"4. National communications with the public.
Our key findings are:
- Canadians were seeking reassurance from governments that public health was being protected.

- Information about the outbreak did not provide the public with what they needed; it was sometimes inconsistent given the many jurisdictions involved, sometimes hard to find and sometimes difficult to understand. (Chap 8, Rec 26, 40)

- The majority of Canadians were unaware which segments of the population were at greater risk of becoming ill if exposed to _Listeria monocytogenes_, and what foods these vulnerable groups should avoid (such as pointing to the need for precautionary labelling). (Chap 8, Rec 42)

- There was an absence of an 'advance' communications strategy and related implementation plan, that should have included ready-made information products and the use of traditional and new media vehicles. (Chap 8, Rec 41)

- Federal communications to the public were slow off the mark, and were not sustained for a sufficient period of time. In addition, there was no designated communications coordinator, which resulted in a fragmented approach and seemingly inconsistent messaging.

- Having the Minister responsible for Agriculture and Agri-food and the CFIA serve as the lead ministerial spokesperson, was considered by some to be a 'conflict of interest' even though the minister has a legitimate role in relation to the food industry. It appeared to limit government's capacity to communicate health information sought by the public. The perceived lack of federal public health leadership during the outbreak attracted many comments. (Chap 8)

- The greatest challenges for physicians in educating patients about minimizing risks of foodborne illness are lack of patient-friendly materials (77 percent), lack of knowledge about the outbreak (69 percent), and lack of time (69 percent). (Chap 8)"
