Hungary Fears Meningitis Epidemic As Fourth Person Dies
---------------------------------------------
Hungary is facing a meningitis epidemic after a fourth person died
of the disease in Budapest, Hungarian medical authorities said
Tuesday.
Since December, 32 people have been hospitalized with the killer
illness, more than the average number for a whole year, said Ilona
Straub, head of the national epidemology center.
"On the basis of the number of people who are sick ... we can
qualify it as an epidemic," she said, adding that usually 20-40
people contract the disease each year.
The fatalities so far were a 50-year-old Budapest woman, a 4-year-
old child in eastern Hungary and a teenager in the central town of
Kecskemet. The latest victim was a one-year-old child in Budapest.
A 10-year-old girl in the eastern Debrecen was in critical condition
Tuesday, while a Budapest conscript hospitalized Sunday was in
"satisfactory" condition, Straub said.
The outbreak started in army barracks in Szabadszallas and
Kecskemet, in central Hungary. Health authorities said they had
since vaccinated the entire force of 2600 troops.
They planned to vaccinate troops in barracks in Tapolca and
Szombathely as soon as vaccines arrived in Hungary, chief army
doctor Laszlo Sved said.
"This virus attacks young people who live in a closed community
and are under increased physical pressure," said doctor Ilona
Molnar. Doctors have warned patients to seek early treatment as
this type of meningitis starts with symptoms of a common cold but
can be deadly within 24 hours if not treated.

[ProMED-mail slipped up on this one. We received early notice of
the cases in army barracks, but chose not to post in the
expectation that the illness would remain confined there. We
should have known better.
Although this news report does not specify whether the meningitis
is bacterial (meningococcal) or viral, given the season of the year
& severity of the disease it is more likely the former, rather than the
ECHO-virus meningitis that afflicted Romania, & may have spread
to Hungary, in summer 1999 -- see: Meningitis, viral - Hungary ex
Romania? 19990819123712. - Mod.JW]
