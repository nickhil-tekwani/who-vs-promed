It is curious than these 2 dogs were not treated with Intravenous Lipid Emulsion (ILE), to absorb the toxin while still in the bloodstream, reducing symptoms and shortening the time to recovery. Given the increased risk of accidental exposure of pets to marijuana post-legalization, it would be prudent for veterinarians, especially those dealing with emergency cases, have ILE on hand.
