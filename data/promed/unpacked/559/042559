Information from the RKI on MERS-Coronavirus case - 7 Mar 2015
Situation in Germany
This is the 3rd time a MERS-CoV case has been diagnosed in Germany. As with the 2 previous cases, this case was an imported case of an individual arriving from the Arabian Peninsula. The case is a 65 year old German who had traveled to the United Arab Emirates and is currently being treated in a hospital in Lower Saxony. The Ministry of Health of Lower Saxony released the information in a press release on 7 Mar 2015. People with close contact with the patient were identified and are being monitored by the relevant health authorities -- [both] at the local and state level in close contact with the Robert Koch Institute. Generally MERS-CoV is not easily transmitted (person-to-person), so that even in the event of secondary cases one does not expect longer chains of infection to occur. In Germany, therefore, there is no increased risk of disease in the general population.

In the past, one patient was treated in Germany in 2012 and one in 2013 -- one was from Qatar and the other from the United Arab Emirates. One patient recovered, the other died. Contact investigation in both previous cases revealed no evidence of secondary infections (Buchholz et al. Euro Surveillance [21 Feb 2013] http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=20406 ;. Epidemiological Bulletin No. 31/2013, http://www.rki.de/DE/Content/Infekt/EpidBull/Archiv/2013/Ausgaben/31_13.pdf?__blob=publicationFile).

The 1st outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) associated disease occurred in April 2012. Clinically proven cases initially present with an acute onset of a flu-like illness. The incubation period is usually 1-2 weeks. In severe cases, a pneumonia may develop, which may turn into an acute respiratory distress syndrome. A common accompanying symptom is diarrhea; severe cases may develop kidney failure. Severe reactions mainly occur in people with chronic underlying medical conditions such as diabetes, cancer or immunosuppression.

Since MERS 1st appeared in 2012 over a thousand laboratory confirmed cases have been reported by WHO, mainly from the Arabian Peninsula, and about 40 per cent of the cases have died.

MERS in the Arabian Peninsula
All previous cases were associated directly or via contact with another patient who had contact with the Arabian Peninsula and neighboring countries. Primary disease cases -- that is, cases with no prior exposure to human cases occurred mainly in Saudi Arabia, but also in other countries such as the United Arab Emirates, Iran, Jordan, Qatar, Oman and Kuwait. During the period March 2012-March 2013 more than 5 cases were reported on a monthly basis, the monthly number from April 2013 about a year rose to about 10-20. In April and May 2014, several large hospital outbreaks were reported in which up to 100 new cases occurred in a week. As of June 2014, the number of new cases has returned approximately to the state before April 2014.

Many of the cases classified as sporadic (or primary case) cases had contact with dromedaries, but a significant proportion of these primary cases are currently not attributable to a zoonotic source. Important for global risk assessment -- but also for Germany -- is that there is as yet no evidence of sustained transmission in the general population. However, imported cases of the disease are possible at any time, since about 1 million people fly every year from the countries of the Arabian Peninsula to Germany. In Europe, imported cases and secondary cases related to imported cases have occurred in small numbers from Germany, France, Greece, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, Austria and Turkey and have been reported. Additional imported cases have also been reported in Africa (Algeria, Tunisia), North America (the United States) and Asia (Malaysia, the Philippines). As part of the world intensified surveillance due to the pilgrimages to Saudi Arabia (Hajj or Umrah) single laboratory-confirmed MERS cases were identified at best.

There is increasing scientific evidence that camels are the source for the human, zoonotic infections. This is partly due to the finding that in a large proportion of camels from Arab countries, but also African countries, antibodies against MERS-CoV were found, and the virus itself could also be isolated in dromedaries. From stored samples from 1983 and 1984 antibodies against MERS-CoV were detected in the majority of specimens from camels originating from Somalia and Sudan. In an investigation of a MERS-CoV case (and previously serologically negative) owner of a small dromedary herd a MERS-CoV was identified, with gene sequences corresponding to 100 per cent with the virus of one of his diseased camels. This was regarded as conclusive evidence that at least in this situation, a dromedary had transmitted the virus to a human. Finally, a higher risk of infection with MERS-CoV in people who worked with camels when compared with those who do not work with dromedaries.

Regarding the risk of transmission, there is conflicting evidence. Although it has been described that the morbidity and infection rate was low in household contacts of primary cases, on the other hand, there have been several, some large, nosocomial outbreaks that have occurred.

Advice for travelers
For travelers to the countries of the Arabian Peninsula and its neighboring countries, the World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended no travel restrictions. Individuals with an underlying disease such as diabetes should consult a doctor or physician before traveling. Based on the findings in dromedaries. WHO notes that travelers should avoid contact with dromedaries, should not go to dromedary farms, and should not consume raw or incompletely cooked camel products. In addition, the usual rules of everyday hygiene should be observed, in particular people should wash hands often and maintain a distance for people with acute respiratory symptoms. WHO recommends those with acute respiratory illness and fever to postpone their trips.

[As mentioned above, this is now the 3rd case of MERS-CoV infection confirmed in Germany since 2012. The 1st case was a patient transferred to Germany from Qatar for a severe respiratory illness in late October 2012 (see Novel coronavirus - Saudi Arabia (18): WHO, new cases, cluster 20121123.1421664, Novel coronavirus - East. Med. (07): Saudi Arabia, UK, Germany 20130221.1554109, and the Eurosurveillance article referred to in the above report). The 2nd case was a patient transferred to Germany from a hospital in Abu Dhabi UAE, also for management of a severe respiratory illness in March 2013 (see Novel coronavirus - Eastern Mediterranean (14): Germany ex UAE, WHO, fatal 20130326.1604564 and Novel coronavirus - Eastern Mediterranean (13): Germany ex UAE 20130326.1603038). More information on the epidemiologic investigation of this case (location traveled within the UAE, possible high risk exposures while in the UAE would be greatly appreciated. Of note, the UAE has reported the 2nd highest number of cases of MERS-CoV infection. According to figures maintained by the ECDC, as of 6 Mar 2015 there have been a total of 74 cases of MERS-CoV infection reported by the UAE, including 10 deaths. (http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications/Publications/communicable-disease-threats-report-07-mar-2015.pdf).

[The addition of this newly reported case in Saudi Arabia brings the total number of cases reported by Saudi Arabia since June 2012 to 939, including 403 deaths (case fatality rate 43 per cent). Since the beginning of March 2015, a total of 19 newly confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection [including 8 deaths] have been reported by Saudi Arabia. 15 of the 19 reported cases since the beginning of March 2015 have been reported from Riyadh. Six of the cases gave a definite history of contact with suspected/confirmed cases in either the healthcare environment or the community and another 3 had a possible history of contact with cases that was under investigation.
