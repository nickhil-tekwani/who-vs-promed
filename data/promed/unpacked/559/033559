At least 3 people died, and over 183 were hospitalized in the northwestern city of Kano after taking expired and poisonous fruit drinks, officials said Tue 16 Mar 2021.

The Kano State commissioner for health, Dr. Aminu Ibrahim Tsanyawa, said the outbreak has spread to about 13 local government areas.

Speaking to reporters, Tsanyawa said the incident occurred when the patients took expired citric acid powdered drinks. He said the outbreak affected 284 people, adding 101 have been discharged from hospitals, while 183 patients are currently receiving treatment.

The official said the ministry taskforce seized expired items believed to have caused the outbreak worth over 59 million Naira [USD 143 993].

Meanwhile, the Kano State Health Ministry said the affected patients showed symptoms of hematuria, which causes bloody urine, fever, lethargy, and sometimes yellowness of the eyes (jaundice).

Dr. Bashir Lawal, an epidemiologist in the Health Ministry, told reporters that "these symptoms are classical examples of hemolysis (breakage of red blood cells) and bleeding. We initially suspected viral hemorrhagic fever, but the test results came back negative for yellow fever and Lassa fever. But we are still awaiting the test result of dengue fever."

The state government has provided a list of hospitals designated for the patients affected by this outbreak. The hospitals include Aminu Kano Teaching Hospital (AKTH), Murtala Muhammad Specialist Hospital, Infectious Disease Hospital, Sheikh Jidda Hospital, Waziri Shehu Gidado Hospital, Rano General Hospital and 2 hospitals in Dawakin Tofa local government area.

Dr. Lawal explained that the outbreak has spread to 8 local government areas, including Gwale, Kano Municipal, Dala, Bunkure, Fagge, Gwarzo and Dawakin Tofa.

He said a water sample was also being analyzed, adding that 3 samples of expired fruit drinks were being tested to confirm the poisoning link to either expired ingredients or preservatives. The State Consumer Protection Council is also investigating the circumstances leading to the poisoning.

An official source told Anadolu Agency on anonymity that "officials are currently conducting a shop-to-shop operation in the market," adding that expired products were brought into the Singer market in the state as the holy month of Ramadan approaches.

The Kano government, on Tue 15 Mar 2021, confirmed 3 persons dead and 284 others infected in the outbreak of a strange disease.

Commissioner for Health, Aminu Ibrahim-Tsanyawa, spoke to reporters at a press conference. The medical doctor said the infected persons had been admitted to 25 health facilities.

Ibrahim-Tsanyawa noted that the disease, 1st recorded on 10 Mar 2021, was suspected to be caused by consumption of contaminated flavoring and a brand of expired instant drink products.

He said affected persons were identified in 13 local government areas; 101 of them had been discharged, with 183 currently on admission.

The affected LGAs are Dala Gwale, Kano Municipal, Fage, Ungogo, Kumbotso, Tarauni, Bunkure, Rano, Dawakinjudu, Dawakin Tofa, Gwarzo and Danbatta.

Ibrahim-Tsanyawa disclosed that the index case, a 6-year-old girl, developed abdominal pain, vomiting, jaundice, and urinating blood (hematuria) after drinking water bought from a vendor. The vendor, according to him, sourced the water from a borehole at a cemetery in the metropolis.

The assumption involves instant drink flavour powder and a variety of salt for industrial use (caustic powder).

"Water, blood, and different instant drink flavour powder samples have been taken for tests to pin down a diagnosis, ranging from food-borne disease, food poisoning, Lassa fever, yellow fever, dengue fever, chemical poisoning, and toxic hepatitis," he said.

Ibrahim-Tsanyawa noted the ministry was still awaiting the results of sample analyses to establish the cause(s) of the infection and identify the disease.

The health ministry is working with the National Agency for Food, Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) and the State Consumer Protection Council (KSCPC).

The state has deployed personnel and scaled up surveillance in the 44 LGAs to check the circulation of the suspected products.

Two persons have reportedly been killed, while over 160 have taken ill over suspected food poisoning in Kano State.

It was gathered that all the patients had taken expired citric acid powdered drinks.

The products, which expired a year ago, were still being sold in the market.

The Kano State Ministry of Health has confirmed that the affected patients are showing symptoms of haematuria (bloody urine), dark urine, fever, lethargy and sometimes yellowness of the eyes (jaundice). The state's epidemiologist, Dr Bashir Lawan, said the index case was a six-year-old girl seen on 6 Mar 2021.

"We initially suspected viral hemorrhagic fever, but the test results came back from the National Reference Laboratory as negative for yellow fever and Lassa fever. But we are waiting for on dengue fever," Dr Lawan said.

He explained the outbreak had spread to 8 local government areas, including Gwale, Kano Municipal, Dla, Bunkure, Fagge, Gwarzo and Dawakin Tofa. He also confirmed water samples were taken from Dandolo cemetery's borehole for analysis to consider other potential causes of the outbreak.

He added that about 3 samples of expired mixed fruit and citric acid powder were available for laboratory testing to confirm the link to either expired ingredients or preservatives, while 4 additional samples were taken for heavy metals and leptospirosis screening, among other technical response activities.

Meanwhile, the state government has provided a list of hospitals designated for patients affected by this outbreak to be admitted for treatment. The hospitals include Aminu Kano Teaching Hospital (AKTH), Murtala Muhammad Specialist Hospital and Infectious Disease Hospital.

Others are Shaikh Muhamamd Jidda Hospital, Shehu Waziri Gidado Hospital, Rano General Hospital, and 2 hospitals in Dawakin Tofa Local Government Area.

During a visit to the Infectious Disease Hospital with over 30 patients on admission, Daily Trust learnt they were suffering serious abdominal pain, vomiting, and blood traces in their urine.

In the meantime, the National Agency for Food, Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) says it has collected water samples and flavour products for laboratory analysis following the outbreak of the strange infectious disease in Kano metropolis. The state coordinator of the NAFDAC, Shaba Muhammad, told the News Agency of Nigeria in Kano that the samples were referred to its laboratory in Kaduna for analysis.

[Each of these articles provides tiny bits of information which taken together still does not yield a complete picture.

The number of affected individuals remains essentially the same in each article. The issue of an expired drink remains in each article. However, the substance used in flavoring the drink does not seem to be revealed. I wonder what the flavoring was made from and whether it affected the water in such a way as to require an expiration date.

One of the articles here indicates the bottling company used water from a bore site. Bore sites sometimes contain a variety of heavy metals, such as lead, copper, and others. Copper can cause hematuria (bloody urine) in both human beings and in animals, as can lead, mercury, cadmium and others. I would want a water analysis of the product and of the bore hole site water.

Furthermore, I would be interested in what the flavoring contents were. At the moment, it cannot be ruled out that the flavoring may have been made from some toxic element, such as excessive copper. Other ingredients in the flavoring may mask any taste of a metal.

While citric acid is not associated with kidney disease, a constituent in a contaminated batch of citric acid could cause problems. But without an analysis, this remains speculation.

The clinical signs of hematuria, fever, lethargy, and sometimes jaundice (yellowness of the eyes), makes me think there is more than a heavy metal involved, but it may depend upon which heavy metal or metals. Fever as a clinical sign makes me think more of a possibly infectious etiology.

The fact that this malady seems to be in multiple places within the country may mean that it is associated with a water source, perhaps more than just the bottled drink.

We wish the investigators the best and anxiously await a diagnosis. - Mod.TG
