The circulation of Rift Valley fever (RVF) continues in Mayotte as of 1 Mar 2019, the prefecture has reported. Raw milk should not be consumed if it is not treated. A viral animal disease, Rift Valley fever mainly affects domestic ruminants (cattle, sheep, goats), causing abortions and high mortality in young animals. As we reported earlier, a quarter of Coconi high school is affected.

The virus can be transmitted from sick animals to humans. Since the 1st cases occurred in late November 2018, 39 animal outbreaks have been identified, and 82 human cases have been reported.

The prefecture of Mayotte, in collaboration with the ARS Indian Ocean and the Directorate of Food, Agriculture and Forestry of Mayotte (DAAF) stresses the importance of prevention measures to protect yourself from the disease.

Epidemiological situation as of 1 Mar 2019
------------------------------------------
Protect yourself during handling. In total, since the beginning of the epidemic (end of November 2018):
- Samples taken by veterinarians from sick animals or during abortions have identified 39 outbreaks (30 bovine). Animal foci are mainly located in the center and north west of the island.
- 82 human cases of RVF have been reported to the monitoring and health emergencies platform of the Agence régionale de santé Océan Indien (CVAGS) of Réunion and Mayotte by the CHM laboratory. The weekly number of reported cases has remained stable for 3 weeks. Human cases are mainly located in the center and northwest of the island.

In ruminants, the monitoring of Rift Valley fever involves the monitoring of abortions:
- breeders are required to report promptly to veterinarians any abortions occurring in their animals or sick animals in order to take samples from the animals;
- an order prohibiting the marketing of untreated milk has been in force since 27 Feb 2019.

In humans, the disease usually manifests as an influenza-like illness: high fever (39 C [102 F]), muscle and/or joint pain, severe headache, and fatigue. In the vast majority of cases, healing occurs within a few days. Consult a doctor as soon as signs appear so that samples to detect the disease can be taken.

For breeders and people in contact with animals:
- wash hands with soap after contact with domestic ruminants (cattle, sheep, goats);
- do not handle unprotected or diseased animals or abortion products without protection;
- do not handle animal carcasses without protection;
- wear gloves, goggles and especially a mask for the slaughter of any animal. Infected animals may have no signs, although they can transmit the virus.

For food preparation:
- boil the milk;
- do not consume curd unless it has been boiled and curdled via lactic fermentation;
- wash hands after cutting meat;
- do not eat uncooked meat;
- do not consume the meat of a sick animal.

To protect yourself from mosquito bites:
- eliminate breeding sites, empty all containers that may contain water;
- use mosquito nets and repellents.

In the event of symptoms appearing, immediately consult your doctor.

[This Rift Valley fever (RVF) outbreak has been going on since November 2018. The number of human cases of RVF has increased from 63 to 82 in about 2 weeks. The above report does not indicate whether the human infections are the result of contact with infected animals or their products or from virus transmission by mosquito vectors. The cattle cases certainly are the result of mosquito transmission.

Because RVF virus can be transovarially transmitted in populations of aedes mosquito vectors, and those resulting eggs can persist for a long period of time in nature, cases can occur periodically when the virus-containing eggs hatch, and infected adult females emerge from them.

Recent studies have shown that RVF virus may severely injure human fetuses if contracted by mothers during pregnancy. There is no indication of whether any of the 63 RVF virus-infected people were pregnant. Abortions in infected livestock are common. There is no vaccine available for human use, but there is for livestock. There is no mention of whether the livestock populations in the area have been vaccinated.

The clinical findings related to the above human cases are not mentioned, but the symptoms associated with RVF infections in general are listed. In an earlier comment, Mod.CP noted that: "The most common complication associated with RVF is inflammation of the retina. As a result, approximately 1-10% of affected patients may have some permanent vision loss. Approximately 1% of humans that become infected with RVF virus die of the disease." - Mod.TY
