The Mauritanian government announced the registration of 3 deaths due to a haemorrhagic fever known as "Rift Valley fever", out of 5 cases in the governorates of Tigant and Assaba, while several animal cases were recorded in 5 states, according to Mauritanian news.

The Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Rural Development said that several cases in livestock were confirmed in some locations in Assaba, Tagant, Hodh El Gharbi, Brakna, and Tararza.

The 2 ministries confirmed after the announcement of the 1st cases of hemorrhagic fever, that the health and rural development sectors immediately took the initiative to issue their directives to the surveillance teams, and then take adequate control measures.

The statement added that the 2 ministers assisted the technical teams to assess the situation and ensure the readiness of their members and their ability to face any emergency situations.

The statement indicated that the consumption of pasteurized milk, milk after heating, and cooked meat does not carry a risk of infection with Rift Valley fever.

In their statement, the 2 ministries advised the public to follow several precautionary measures, including "heating milk before consuming it, properly cooking meat, isolating animals from human housing, washing hands with soap after touching animals, burning and burying dead animal bodies, and sleeping under mosquito nets."

They also called for "informing the human health interests in the event of a human hemorrhage, and to inform the veterinary services in case of registration of abortion in livestock."

Both ministries stressed the need to reduce herd movements, to report outbreaks of any type of disease, and to cooperate with the competent veterinary services to ensure the safety of the work carried out there.
