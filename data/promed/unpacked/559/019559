Liner Orders Clean-up after Passengers Laid Low by Vomiting Bug
---------------------------------------------------------------
A cruise liner will undergo a major cleaning
operation in Leith (the port for Edinburgh) today
after more than 100 passengers were struck down
by a vomiting virus. The "Black Prince" was
expected to sail off this evening following
extensive disinfection and treatment of the 11 209 tonne vessel.
In total, 116 of the 412 passengers on the Black
Prince, which left Edinburgh on a 7-day cruise of
the Norwegian fjords last weekend, were diagnosed
with the bug and confined to their cabins. A
statement from the cruise line firm said
yesterday: "Fred Olsen Cruise Lines can confirm
there have been 116 cases of [presumed] norovirus
[infection] on its ship Black Prince during the current cruise.
"The company routinely carries out extensive
cleansing and disinfecting programmes every day
and immediately the 1st cases were reported it
put into place an even more rigorous hygiene
regime. "The next cruise is due to depart from
Leith on [Saturday] 10 Jun 2006 and the sailing
time has been delayed to mid-evening to allow
extensive treatment of the ship. "It is highly
contagious and is spread by person-to-person
contact, and from fixtures such as furniture or
handrails if recently touched by an infected person."
Fred Olsen said any compensation for passengers,
who paid between �500 and �1400 [USD 921.35 and
USD 2579.79], would be settled on a case-by-case
basis. The company, which has been operating
cruises from Leith since 2002, said outbreaks of
the virus were "extremely common".
The Black Prince is not the only liner to have
been hit by a norovirus recently. Sixty-three
passengers on the "Funchal", which set out from
Dundee for a tour of Greenland, Iceland and the
Faroe Islands, were hit by a bug last week. About
200 passengers were infected by a similar
outbreak last month on the "Sea Princess", which
had to cancel its 7-night European tour from
Southampton. Also earlier this month, 2 British
pensioners were carried off the "Van Gogh" at
Harwich docks in Essex and taken to hospital
after norovirus [infection] affected 117 passengers and crew.
The virus causes severe vomiting and diarrhoea
and usually affects sufferers for between 24 and
48 hours. A report last year, "Behind the Scenes
in the Cruise Ship Galleys", published by Which?
magazine, revealed poor hygiene and numerous
health hazards following random checks on 14
British cruise ships docking at UK ports.
Inspectors found veal nearly a year out of date,
cockroaches and swarms of flies in food larders.
Which? obtained the findings under new freedom of
information rules - the only way to see the
reports of UK port authority inspectors. The
documents showed that many of the outbreaks had been caused by the norovirus.

Alaskan Cruise Ship Returns After 115 Get Sick
----------------------------------------------
The Celebrity cruise ship "Mercury" returned to
Seattle Friday morning [9 Jun 2006] with 115
people who had a gastrointestinal illness during
their 7-night voyage to Alaska, the cruise
company said. Three of the ship's 847 crew
members also experienced the illness, a suspected
norovirus brought on board by someone previously
exposed. The Mercury carried 2034 passengers on
the voyage.According to the U.S. Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, noroviruses
affect 23 million Americans annually. The only
illness more prevalent is the common cold.
"The reason you hear about norovirus on cruise
ships is because they are required to report
every incidence of gastrointestinal illness,"
said Dave Forney, chief of the vessel sanitation
program of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control
and Protection, in a statement. "Nowhere else in
the public health system of the United States is
norovirus a reportable illness. Norovirus is not
a cruise-ship illness, but an illness commonly
seen in many settings throughout the United
States."Celebrity Cruises blames an increased
number of norovirus cases on land for the
increase in incidents on board their ships. The
company has instituted a new illness prevention
program focusing on increased sanitation,
enhanced cleaning procedures and special cleaning
of "high touch" areas on the ship.
The company has added 2 additional doctors to its
crew, bringing the total number of doctors
onboard the Mercury to 4, along with 3 nurses.
Mercury sailed from Seattle on Fri 2 Jun 2006,
and visited Juneau, Skagway and Ketchikan,
Alaska, Hubbard Glacier and the Inside Passage.

[Norovirus infection continues to cause problems
for companies operating cruise liners on both
sides of the Atlantic. While this may reflect a
simultaneous seasonal increase in prevalence of
norovirus infection in northern Europe and North
America, other factors cannot be excluded
entirely. The investigation conducted by the
magazine "Which?", invoking "freedom of
information" legislation, has revealed disturbing
lapses in hygiene in specific cases. Generally ,
however, the disinfection procedures developed by
cruise ship operators have been effective and
allowed the rapid turn-around of ships without
any enhanced risk to passengers and crew. In
general the frequency of outbreaks of norovirus
infection on cruise liners is probably no greater
than in other situations where people from
diverse backgrounds are brought into close
proximity (e.g. hospital wards, schools, recreational camps, etc).
Consequently these reports of norovirus infection
affecting passengers on cruise liners will be
discontinued for the present. - Mod.CP]
