Buenos Aires Health Minister Ismael Passaglia said yesterday, 31 Mar 2004,
that water contaminated with bacteria has infected some 900 people in the
Buenos Aires province district of Rojas over the past week. Authorities
explained that the outdated system which provides water for the 26 000
residents of Rojas and the lack of maintenance caused the bacterial outbreak.
"Scientists found the bacteria, _Shigella sp._ and [the protozoan -
Mod.LL] _Giardia lamblia_, which is why the water is not safe for
humans,"said Passaglia during a press conference, adding: "The water
purification plants are not working as they should." The system providing
drinking water in Rojas is 70 years old.
Rojas Mayor Norberto Aloe said: "It's been a long time since the tank has
been cleaned, and a lot of the pipelines connected to the water pumps have
leaks."
The outbreak began last Wed, 24 Mar 2004, when 5 children from a private
school became ill. By Mon, 29 Mar, hundreds suffered from stomach cramps,
vomiting, diarrhea, and fever. Over 80 percent of the 900 cases are
children between the ages of 6 and 12.
Rojas Health Director Luis Medina reported: "The number of cases of people
infected by shigellosis is over 900." He added yesterday:"Since last night
until today hospitals have received 300 cases, and we are putting more
staff in emergency rooms."
On 30 Mar 2004, the army sent a portable water-processing plant with the
capacity to process 3500 liters of water per hour to distribute to residents.

[The scope of this shigella outbreak (of unreported species and
antimicrobial sensitivity pattern) is yet to be known, but if the water
supply issue has been addressed, it may be blunted. Any role that
giardiasis plays in symptoms is unknown at this point, but it is likely not
to be negligible. - Mod.LL]
