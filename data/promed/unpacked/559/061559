French food safety agency AFSSA renewed calls on Thursday for a ban on the
use of most cattle intestines in food, a move that could have a dramatic
effect on the country's processed meats industry. AFSSA recommended
removing from the food chain intestines, spleen and thymus from cattle born
before 1 May 1999 amid fears they may harbour mad cow disease. The French
charcuterie federation has asked the government to undertake studies to
show that the methods of treating cattle guts for use in food products
eliminates the risk of contamination by mad cow disease, or bovine
spongiform encephalopathy (BSE).

German scientists have developed a novel, highly sensitive technique for
the detection of prions, the infectious agents of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease
(CJD) and BSE. By this method, single prion particles can be identified in
body fluids. For the first time, prions could be detected in the
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of CJD patients. A clinical test to be used on a
routine basis is being developed. This technique permits direct detection
of prions in the cerebrospinal fluid, which is easily accessible for
diagnostic purposes.
