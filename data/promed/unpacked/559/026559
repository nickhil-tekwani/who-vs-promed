One more child died of measles in remote Udolchhari Chakma Para under Sajek union of Rangamati's Baghaichhari upazila early today [1 Apr 2020] taking the death toll in the recent measles outbreak in Chattogram Hill Tracts to 10.

[A 15-year-old child] died at his house around 2:30am, said Nelson Chakma, chairman of Sajek union.

Earlier, 9 children of Tripura and Mro communities died of measles in the remote areas of Rangamati, Bandarban and Khagrachari since 26 Feb 2020.

A 5-member medical team, including an MBBS doctor, went to the affected area this morning [1 Apr 2020], said Md Ahosan Habib, upazila nirbahi officer (UNO) of Baghaichhari Upazila.

"We are going to take some inclusive work plans, including setting up 5 community clinics, sanitation, nutrition, and a water management programme in the affected areas," said the UNO.

"It is true that the EPI programme was not implemented in the measles-affected areas properly as there are some problems," he added.

There are only 2 community clinics for a population of over 16 000 who are mostly from ethnic minority communities in Sajek union, said Ahosan.

The affected children are suffering from serious malnutrition, said Dr Istekhar Ahmed, health officer of Baghaichhari upazila.

The newly measles affected areas in Sajek union are Boroitoli Para, Chip Para, Sath Nong Para, Ujanchaari Para, Shilchhari Para, Kojoichhari Para, Buyachhari Para, Lambabak Para and Bethbunia area, said Nelson Chakma, chairman of the union.

A minor girl has died, and around 20 other children fell sick from an unknown disease in several remote areas under Merung union of Dighinala upazila.

The deceased was aged 9, a Class-III student and daughter of O.T. of Rothichandra Karbaripara.

[She] was suffering from fever along with rash on her body, and died on Sat 4 Apr 2020.

Besides, around 20 children aged below 10 of Jorek Para and Homekpara areas fell sick showing the same symptoms. The condition of a minor boy was described as critical.

Charan Bikash said the condition of many children is critical there, but they could not take them to hospital for financial constraints and suspension of vehicular movement.

On information, a medical team of the local health office along with upazila nirbahi officer Mohammad Ullah went to the spot and observed the patients. The team also gave them medicine.

Upazila health and family planning officer Dr Tonoy Talukder, who led the team, said the symptoms were of viral fever and viral pneumonia. However, they will send samples to Dhaka for confirmation on whether they are infected with measles, he said. "Then further treatment will be given."

The UNO said the children might have been infected with measles. "After confirmation, we'll take initiatives for arranging MR campaigns under special arrangement."

[Critically sick children were not able to be taken to the hospital because of a suspension of traffic movements and financial restraints. But, a medical team of the local health office was dispatched to treat the sick children in their home location. It is not clear how they were treated, since if measles is the causative agent, as it likely is, there is only supportive treatment. But it would be wise to vaccinate the other children in the village without waiting for confirmation of measles. It should be a routine protocol for children. - Mod.LK]

https://www.liberianobserver.com/news/measles-outbreak-reported-in-nimba/


Amid the outbreak of coronavirus in Liberia, there is also a report of an outbreak of measles in 2 districts of Nimba County.

Speaking on Radio Nimba on the morning of Tue 24 Mar 2020, the surveillance officers of the County Health Team, Isaac Cole and Telekpeh Weh Johnson, named the 2 districts as Sanniquellie and Tappita. They said the Ministry of Health has begun a routine vaccination campaign in the affected areas.

When contacted for more details, one of the surveillance officers, Mr. Talekpeh Wehyee Johnson, could not give the exact numbers of cases treated, because the data officer was not close to him, but said hundreds of children were treated. He said the number of cases in Tappita has dropped, and it is only Sanniquelliie that still has some cases of measles.

He named Gbapa, an old mining town near Yekepa, as one of the highly hit communities in the Sanniquellie Mah District.

The measles situation was disclosed when the surveillance officers appeared on local radio to intensify awareness on the deadly coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak in the country. They urged the citizens to abide by all the preventive measures prescribed by the MOH.

They also reassured the public that the ongoing vaccination campaign is strictly intended for measles, not COVID-19, as has wrongly been disclosed to the public. However, COVID-19 preventive awareness is also intensifying on local radio stations across Nimba, with some visible signs of cooperation among citizens.

Nearly all the business centers and private homes in Nimba have buckets full of water for hand-washing.

The fear of COVID-19 has slowed down businesses and movements across the county. Although most night clubs are still open in Ganta, customers are not frequenting such venues as they did under normal circumstances. Some of the leading restaurants are mostly empty, with people basically concentrating on buying food for storage and preparation at home.

"We are only looking for food money now, because there are no customers," said Boye Suah, a proprietor of an entertainment center.

Meanwhile, commercial vehicles continue to ply between Ganta and Monrovia, but they are not fully abiding by the rules and regulations set by MoH, which calls for 3 passengers in a taxi.

The public buses are also running and carrying 60 passengers on each bus, but the closeness of the passengers on seats has created much public concern.

The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC)'s battered healthcare system needs urgent support as it struggles with measles and cholera epidemics that kill thousands of children, as well as the mounting threat from the coronavirus, COVID-19, says UNICEF.

In a report released today [Tue 31 Mar 2020], the UN children's agency says that ongoing efforts to contain an Ebola outbreak in the east of the country have diverted attention and resources from already enfeebled healthcare facilities, which are dealing with several deadly endemic diseases.

Since early 2019, a measles epidemic -- the worst in the world -- has killed more than 5300 children under the age of 5, while there have been some 31 000 cases of cholera. Now, cases of the coronavirus, COVID-19, are increasing fast, posing a major challenge to a country identified as one of the most at risk in Africa.

Yet in public health centres, equipment, trained staff, and funds are in desperately short supply. Many facilities even lack safe water and sanitation. Immunization rates that were already low have dropped sharply in some provinces over the past year.

An estimated 3.3 million children in the DRC have unmet vital health needs, while across the country, 9.1 million children (nearly 1 in 5 of the under-18 population) require humanitarian assistance.

Many of the most vulnerable children live in 3 conflict-affected eastern provinces impacted by the Ebola outbreak. Brutal militia violence -- including attacks targeting health centres -- forced nearly a million people from their homes in 2019 alone, making it even harder for children to access essential medical care.

Malaria, measles, and cholera epidemics are a lethal threat in every part of the country. Remote rural communities are particularly vulnerable.

The report says:
- Around 16.5 million malaria cases were reported in 2019, causing nearly 17 000 deaths. Children under the age of 5 are most severely affected by the disease.

- Measles cases surged in 2019-20 to reach 332 000 nationwide, making it the worst outbreak in the DRC's history. Out of more than 6200 recorded fatalities, around 85 per cent were children under the age of 5.

- Cholera is endemic, the consequence of poor sanitation and the dirty water that many families rely on for drinking and washing. Cholera killed around 540 people in 2019. Children make up about 45 per cent of cases.

"Strengthening the DRC's basic healthcare system is absolutely vital," said UNICEF DRC Representative Edouard Beigbeder.

"Unless health facilities have the means to deliver immunization, nutrition and other essential services, including in remote areas of the country, we risk seeing the lives and futures of many Congolese children scarred or destroyed by preventable diseases."

In the report, UNICEF calls on the government to allocate more of its budget for vital health care services supporting pregnant women, new-born and young children, and to prioritise the strengthening of routine immunization.

The agency urges international donors to commit generous multi-year support to the government's efforts to revamp routine health care services and to reach its SDG goals in water, sanitation and hygiene in order to better protect children against communicable diseases.

[Ebola may be over for now, but the DRC continues to suffer from a number of other serious infectious diseases, including cholera, malaria, measles. Because measles immunosuppresses infected individuals, they will be more susceptible to other infections, such as those listed earlier and SARS-CoV-2. This is very concerning in light of the threat posed by SARS-CoV-2 presence in the country. - Mod.LK]

There are already 2942 dengue cases and 158 measles cases in Argentina.

...Since the beginning of 2019, there were 158 cases of measles confirmed in Argentina and one death: 109 cases in the past year (7 imported or related to import, 2 cases detected in Spain, and 100 of unknown origin) and 49 in 2020 (9 imported and 40 of unknown origin).

Of the total, one case was in the province of Cordoba that had a history of travel to Florianopolis, Brazil; 28 cases in the city of Buenos Aires and 120 in the province of Buenos Aires, in 19 games: Tres de Febrero, Almirante Brown, Avellaneda, Berazategui, General San Martin, Hurlingham, Ituzaingo, La Matanza, Lanus, Lomas de Zamora, Malvinas Argentinas, Marcos Paz, Merlo, Moreno, Moron, Pilar, Quilmes, Tigre and Vicente Lopez.

The greatest number of confirmed measles cases are in children under one year of age, where the highest incidence rate is also observed, followed by groups from 1-4 years. However, the number of cases in adults older than 20 years is significant.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), between 30 and 40 million people contracted measles in 2000, and there were 777 000 deaths. Additionally, between 2000 and 2017, measles vaccination decreased the death toll by 80% worldwide.

While the global COVID-19 pandemic is the priority for health officials the world over, a smaller outbreak of a similar kind is also worrying those in Mexico state, Mexico City, and now Campeche.

According to the Health Ministry's epidemiology department, the number of measles cases in the country doubled in just 10 days.

The outbreak began in a prison in the north of Mexico City on 23 Feb 2020, and state health officials reported on 21 Mar 2020 that the number of cases had grown to 49. In the 10 days since, that number has more than doubled to 101.

A Health Ministry epidemiology report issued at 10:00 p.m. on Tue [31 Mar 2020] said that 87 of the cases are located in Mexico City, 13 are in Mexico state, and one has been identified in the state of Campeche, the 1st of this outbreak confirmed outside of the Valley of Mexico.

Smaller concentrations of imported measles cases sprouted up in several states last year [2019], including Quintana Roo, Chihuahua, Nuevo Leon, San Luis Potosi and Mexico state, but none of them grew to such numbers as the current outbreak.

The borough of Gustavo A. Madero, where the outbreak's epicenter -- the Reclusorio Norte prison -- is located, has most of the city's measles patients with 47. Cases have also been confirmed in 11 other boroughs in the city.

Five of the 13 infected people in Mexico state are in Ecatepec, and there are also measles cases in Tecamac, Tlalnepantla, Naucalpan, Atizapan de Zaragoza, Nezahualcoyotl and Chimalhuacan.

The case reported in Campeche is in the municipality of Champoton, where a 5-year-old girl contracted the disease despite having received the measles vaccine.

Of the 101 confirmed cases, 57 are adults aged 17-68, while 44 are children ranging from 4 months to 13 years old, and 19 had been vaccinated against the disease before contracting it. - Mod.LK]
