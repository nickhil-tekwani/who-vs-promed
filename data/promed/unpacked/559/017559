Ministry cautions about swine flu spread on public vehicles
-----------------------------------------------------------
After 3 people with swine flu were found traveling by train from Ho
Chi Minh City to Hanoi on 26 Jul 2009, the Ministry of Health has
sounded a warning about the threat of contracting [influenza pandemic
(H1N1) virus infection] by using public transport. The passengers on
the train were told to isolate them at homes, monitor their health
condition, and inform health authorities immediately if they suffer
flu symptoms of fever, cough, and sore throat.

Meanwhile, the disease continues to spread in Viet Nam, with 45 more
new cases reported on 26 Jul 2009, taking the total number so far to
612, health officials said. The Department of Preventive Medicine in
the southern province of Binh Duong said an expatriate working for
THP Company tested positive for the virus and he is also suspected of
transmitting it to a colleague. Health authorities have quarantined
them as well as a 3rd person with flu symptoms who had been in
contact with them.

The deputy director of the Department of Preventive Health in the
central province of Ha Tinh, Nguyen Luong Tam, confirmed on 26 Jul
2009 that a 30-year-old man died of bird flu at the General Hospital.
The man had been rushed to hospital the previous day with pneumonia,
high fever, headache, muscular and joint pain, cough, breathing
difficulty, and vomiting. Doctors diagnosed him as having avian
influenza and isolated him. They found his lung to be seriously
damaged. He died on 26 Jul 2009. Health workers later found diseased
poultry at the man's house. He also had contact with a female
relative, a teacher at Ngo Thoi Nhiem private High School in District
9, where 73 students and 5 teachers have contracted swine flu [that
is, influenza pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus infection].

[This suspected case of avian influenza A (H5N1) virus infection, if
confirmed, will become the 112th case and the 57th death to have
occurred in Viet Nam. The most recent previous case died on 27 Apr
2009 in Thanh Hoa province.

The concern in the current (suspected) case is that there is a
potential epidemiological link with an outbreak of influenza pandemic
(H1N1) 2009 virus infection among teachers and children at a school
in the same province.

Confirmation of the H5N1 diagnosis is awaited as are more details of
the investigation of the outbreak at Ngo Thoi Nhiem private High School.
