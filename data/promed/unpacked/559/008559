**** Total number of human cases of WNV illness reported to ArboNET

Neuroinvasive Disease refers to severe disease cases, particularly
West Nile meningitis and West Nile encephalitis. West Nile fever
refers to typically less severe cases that show no evidence of
neuroinvasion. West Nile fever is not currently on the list of
nationally notifiable diseases, and therefore it is optional whether
or not state health departments report these cases to CDC. Click the
above CDC site for further explanations of neuroinvasive West Nile
virus disease and West Nile fever.
Other Clinical includes persons with clinical manifestations other
than WN fever, WN encephalitis or WN meningitis, such as acute
flaccid paralysis. Unspecified cases are those for which sufficient
clinical information was not provided.
Total Human Cases Reported to CDC: These numbers reflect both mild
and severe human disease cases occurring since 1 Jan 2006 that have
been reported to ArboNet by state and local health departments.
ArboNet is the national, electronic surveillance system established
by CDC to assist states in tracking West Nile virus and other
mosquito-borne viruses. Information regarding 2006 virus/disease
activity is posted when such cases are reported to CDC.

2006 West Nile virus activity in the United States (through 15 Aug 2006)
--------------------------------------------------
Data are being collected from state and local health departments on a
weekly basis and are reported to the CDC ArboNET for the following 5
categories: wild birds, sentinel chicken flocks, human cases,
veterinary cases, and mosquito surveillance. Maps detailing
county-level wild birds, sentinel chicken flocks, human cases,
veterinary cases, and mosquito surveillance data are published each
week on the collaborative USGS/CDC West Nile virus website:
As of 8 Aug 2006, avian, animal or mosquito WNV infections have been
reported to CDC ArboNET from the following states: Alabama, Arizona,
Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Idaho,
Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland,
Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana,
Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina,
North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina,
South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia,
Wisconsin, and Wyoming.
WN virus antibody-positive sentinel animals (birds and/or horses)
have been found in Arizona, Arkansas, California, Florida, Iowa,
Montana, North Carolina, North Dakota, and Utah.
WN equine infections have been reported from Arizona, Arkansas,
California, Colorado, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota Mississippi,
Missouri, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oregon, Texas, Utah, Wisconsin and Wyoming.
WN virus has been detected in dead wild birds in Alabama, Arkansas,
California, Colorado, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas,
Kentucky, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri,
Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma,
Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, West
Virginia, and Wisconsin.
WN virus has been detected in mosquito pools collected in Arizona,
Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Idaho, Illinois,
Indiana, Iowa, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota,
Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, Ohio,
Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota,
Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, and Wisconsin. [Although a
WNV-positive mosquito was reported two weeks ago [1 Aug 2006]from
Washington, D.C. in the popular press
(<http://www.thecommondenominator.com/080106_update1.html>), it still
does not appear in this CDC update. ProMED requests additional
information from either CDC or from the Washington, D.C. Health
Department to confirm this earlier report. - Mod.TY]

West Nile fever may not be the benign illness it's usually considered
to be, according to findings from a North Dakota research group.
Patients who have had West Nile virus infections can continue to
experience troubling symptoms, even a year after their illness, the
researchers found.
The retrospective cohort study, published in the 15 Sep 2006 issue of
Clinical Infectious Diseases, involved 49 patients who were
identified through North Dakota's disease surveillance system. In
2003 when the disease had its largest spike in North America, North
Dakota reported 617 cases.
The patients were assessed on average 13 months after they were
diagnosed. Their medical records were reviewed, and they underwent a
complete neurologic examination and took standardized surveys to
determine their quality of life, functional ability, fatigue level,
and depression level. Extensive neuropsychological testing was
performed to gauge patients' cognitive function.
Of the 49 patients in the study, 11 (22 percent) had been diagnosed
with West Nile meningitis or encephalitis and 38 (78 percent) had
been diagnosed with West Nile fever. Fifteen (31 percent) of the
patients had been hospitalized. The fever group included all of the
nonhospitalized patients and 4 who had been hospitalized.
The most common complaints reported by patients were fatigue, memory
problems, extremity weakness, word-finding difficulty, and headache.
The surveys revealed an overall sense of poor health in 24 (49
percent) patients, fatigue in 24 (49 percent), depression in 12 (24
percent), and moderate to severe disability in 4 (8 percent). Ten
patients (20 percent) reported new tremor. Neuropsychological testing
showed abnormalities in motor skills, attention, and executive
function. No significant associations were apparent between any of
the patients' risk factors and the study findings.
The researchers emphasized the high prominence of fatigue among
patients; 41 (84 percent) reported fatigue, and half of them had
fatigue scores that resembled patients who have moderate to severe
multiple sclerosis.
Paradoxically, patients who had more severe illness were not more
likely than those with less severe illness to report more chronic
symptoms. "On the contrary, some of the few statistically significant
associations found in our study were higher rates of fatigue,
word-finding difficulties, and excessive sleepiness in the
nonhospitalized group of patients," they wrote.
Despite patients' persistent symptoms, most returned to a reasonable
level of functioning and independence, the researchers noted.
They theorized that fatigue alone may not explain the patients'
clinical and neuropsychological symptoms, which may be caused instead
by subtle disease damage to the frontal-subcortical brain structures.
"This might suggest that West Nile fever is not a self-limited benign
illness, as previously though, and may, in fact, be a subclinical
encephalitis," the researchers wrote.
So far this year 388 cases of human West Nile virus infection have
been reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC). The total includes 13 fatalities.
According to the CDC, West Nile virus, a flavivirus, infected at
least 2949 people in 2005, causing 116 deaths. Although 80 percent of
those infected will have no symptoms, about 20 percent will develop a
fever, headache, tiredness, body aches, and, occasionally, a rash on
the trunk. One in 150 patients develops severe neuroinvasive disease,
such as encephalitis, meningitis, or poliomyelitis, according to the CDC.
