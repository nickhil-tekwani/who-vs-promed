A 2nd person has anthrax in Nichiteni in Botosani county in
northeastern Romania. A 51-year-old man is in isolation in Botosani
hospital after displaying symptoms of the disease.

A 20-year-old man was hospitalised at the end of last week with
symptoms after he helped slaughter an infected cow. Local authorities
have extended preventive measures to stop the spread of the disease
outside of the initial group of those exposed to it.

The infected animal's owner called in veterinarians after the animal
got sick and died.

[We have gone from 8 under observation to 2 that have developed
clinical symptoms. As these people were previously defined as having
been in contact with the dead animal at a slaughter house, one may
presume that these are both cutaneous cases.
