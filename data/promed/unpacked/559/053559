[The epidemic curve in Figure 1 shows bi-modal peaks at weeks 35 and 42. The map in Figure 2 shows broad geographic distribution of cases, with one new state reporting a case as noted above. Intensified surveillance and response with vaccination campaigns is necessary going into 2018, but given distribution of cases in so many states, it will be a logistical challenge for state and national health agencies.
