An Egyptian young man died Tuesday [16 Apr 2013] of bird flu [avian influenza A/(H5N1) virus infection], raising the death toll of the disease in Egypt to 3 since the beginning of the year [2013], a Health Ministry spokesman told Xinhua. "A 26-year-old man from the governorate of Daqahliya [Dakahlia], north of Cairo, died in hospital after showing symptoms of the avian flu," Yahya Moussa said.

The ministry strongly recommends citizens to consult physicians in case of any suspicion of the disease. Earlier reports from the Agriculture Ministry said Egypt has been implementing a 5-year national strategy since 2010 to eradicate the H5N1 virus.

Last September [2012], an official report said 60 infected people died of bird flu out of 168 cases that appeared in Egypt since 2006.
