--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is very disheartening but not unexpected that _S._ Dublin continues to be spread to people who voluntarily drink raw milk. I was 1 of 2 physicians who testified against Alta Dena dairy in the Consumer Union law suit that resulted in an order by a Superior Court judge in Alameda County to put a large warning label on their raw milk. That reduced their sales to the point that the Stueve family sold the dairy. While raw milk was only a small fraction of their business, it was the passion that kept them in the milk business.

The family was quite wealthy and well-connected politically. I had 2 experiences that illustrate that. They got a California State assemblyman to introduce a bill removing _Salmonella_ from the list of bacteria that were not allowed to be in commercial milk. The bill was referred to the Agriculture committee and at the hearing medical, nursing, and public health society testified against the measure but the committee recommended it nevertheless. I confronted a San Diego assemblyman on the committee who voted for the bill whose response to me was that if I was so interested I should have been in Sacramento before the hearing lobbying the committee as the dairy had done, and that I shouldn't worry about the public health because the Governor would not sign the bill, which was indeed what happened.

My other experience was at the Federal level. The FDA had no jurisdiction over California milk sales, but Alta Dena was selling raw milk in Arizona and Nevada. The FDA was considering a rule banning interstate shipment of raw milk, and the entire California Congressional delegation signed a letter requesting the FDA to back off. I saw the letter just before I was going to Washington to attend an ASM meeting so I arranged to meet with 2 Congressmen from San Diego to protest their signing the letter. One explained that they had an informal agreement to support anything that was beneficial to California, was non-partisan, and non-controversial. This request came from William Dannemeyer, who represented the 39th Congressional district. Unbeknownst to me, he used to be the lawyer for Alta Dena dairy. So less than an hour after I left the office of my representative, I received a call from Dannemeyer's office requesting that I visit. I really did not know him, but as I sat across from him he began to literally cross examine me to find out who had "sent me" to Washington, paid my airfare, etc. Was I part of the California State Health Department, etc?. He finally asked me how many salmonellae I thought were safe to have in milk. When I said none, he threw up his hands and dismissed me, having concluded I was the hopeless fanatic.

Whether or not commercial raw milk sales are allowed in a state is a political decision. I urge other physicians in permissive states to urge abolition of the practice. This will not be easy; they will face opposition from the dairies, and from a small group of consumers who believe the pseudo-science perpetrated on the internet about the health benefits of raw milk and proclaim freedom of choice.

The Gideon database (<www.GideonOnline.com>) chronicles 21 971 outbreaks of infectious diseases which have been published to date, including 1591 (7.2%) of salmonellosis. A total of 10 of the outbreaks (2 in the USA) involved serotype Dublin associated with dairy products. As many as 383 salmonellosis outbreaks (24.1 percent of the global total) occurred in the USA. Where a vehicle is specified, dairy products were implicated in 9.4 percent of the latter.

[In the March 2012 issue of Emerging Infectious Diseases (Langer AJ, Ayers T, Grass J, Lynch M, Angulo FJ and Mahon BE.: Nonpasteurized dairy products, disease outbreaks, and state laws - United States, 1993-2006. Emerg Infect Dis. 2012; 18(3): 385-91, available at: http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/18/3/11-1370_article), the authors report on 121 foodborne outbreaks (with 4413 cases of reported illness) caused by contaminated dairy products, and 73 (60 percent) were involved with unpasteurized dairy products. 65 (54 percent) involved cheese (42 percent made from unpasteurized milk) and 56 involved fluid milk (82 percent involved unpasteurized milk). In these outbreaks, _Campylobacter_ spp was responsible for 54 percent of the outbreaks, followed by _Salmonella_ spp (22 percent), enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ (13 percent), _Brucella_ spp (4 percent), _Listeria_ (4 percent), and _Shigella_ spp (3 percent).

Clearly, pasteurized milk can also transmit disease, and 48 outbreaks were reported. The source of contamination was reported in only 7 (14 percent), of which at least 4 resulted from post-pasteurization contamination by an infected food handler.

The reader is directed to the article for additional information and discussion.

Classical zoonotic organisms such as _Brucella abortus_, _Brucella melitensis_, _Mycobacterium bovis_, _Salmonella_ species, _Listeria monocytogenes_, _Campylobacter_ species, _Yersinia_ species, _Coxiella burnetii_, and _E. coli_ O157:H7 are associated with the ingestion of raw milk. Non-zoonotic organisms such as _Streptococcus pyogenes_, _Salmonella_ Typhi, _Corynebacterium diphtheriae_, _Shigella_ spp, _Salmonella_ Paratyphi A, _Salmonella_ Paratyphi B, enterotoxins from _Staphylococcus aureus_, and hepatitis A have also been associated with the ingestion of raw milk.
