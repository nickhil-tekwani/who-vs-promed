The incidence of mad cow disease or Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE)
in Portugal should reach its peak this year, Luis Vieira, Under-Secretary
for Agriculture and Food Quality, said on Wednesday.
He said the incidence of BSE in Portugal should slow down next year in
response to rigorous government action, including a 1998 decree banning the
use of suspect animal feed in the food chain.
"It is safer to eat beef in Portugal than in other European Union (EU)
countries because Portugal removed animal feed from the food chain," Vieira
said.
In July, the EU extended a ban on Portuguese beef exports until February
2000 because of concerns over the incidence of BSE.
Vieira said the number of cases of BSE could reach approximately 130 this
calendar year. In the first 10 months of 1999, 114 BSE cases were expected.
Vieira told Reuters in an interview last month Portugal had so far reported
a total of 298 cases of mad cow disease, one of the highest incidences in
the EU after Britain.
Portugal is not a major beef exporter. Before the ban, Portugal exported
between 1000 and 3000 tons per year on average, much of it to Spain.
The country imports 40 000 to 50 000 tons of beef per year.
