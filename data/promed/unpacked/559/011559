Legionella bacteria have been found at a nursing home one day after the
death of a former resident who was sent to Harford Memorial Hospital with
symptoms of Legionnaires' disease.
The discovery at Citizens Care Center Friday was the first evidence that
recent exposure to the Legionnaires' disease bacteria, linked to 4 deaths in
the area, was not confined to the hospital.
State health officials have linked 3 of the deaths to bacteria from the
hospital's hot-water system.
Nursing home spokeswoman Janet McDonald said the nursing home flushed and
heat-treated its water system 8 & 9 Jul 1999 after an unidentified resident
in her 80s was admitted to the hospital 28 June with pneumonia and
Legionnaire's disease symptoms. The woman died at the hospital Thursday.
State health officials took more samples from the nursing home Friday to
determine the extent of the infection.
No other residents have been found to have Legionnaires' disease symptoms.
Preliminary testing found bacteria in one shower head at the nursing home,
McDonald said. Officials are awaiting the results of further tests.
Legionellosis is a bacterial infection that can cause mild respiratory
illness or severe pneumonia that can lead to death. Symptoms include a dry
cough, high fever, chills, muscle aches, diarrhea, fatigue, headache and
abdominal pain. The disease is spread by water droplets in the air, and the
bacteria can develop in air conditioners, whirlpools, spas and showers.
The first case came to light 8 Jun 1999 at Harford Memorial Hospital when an
unidentified patient was diagnosed with the disease. That patient was
treated and released soon after.
Another patient died 28 Jun 1999, prompting the state health department to
begin
investigating the hospital as the possible site of the infection. Two other
patients died of the disease on 6 & 9 Jul 1999.
