More than 1.4 million birds were destroyed to stamp out bird influenza that hit poultry farms early this year [2015], according to Dr. Mohammed Ahmed, the Executive Director, National Veterinary Research Institute, Vom.

Ahmed told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Vom on Sun [12 Jul 2015] that 18 states were affected by the flu, the last case being reported on 28 May 2015. He said that 800 [suspected samples] were [tested] in the institute's laboratory, out of which 500 tested positive to the disease. The NVRI boss said that compensation for the destroyed birds was already being paid by the Federal Government.

"Payment of compensation for the destroyed birds is already in progress; it started and stopped at a point, but it has resumed," he said. He observed that the compensation was being handled by the Federal Government and appealed to the states to help by initiating steps to assist farmers.

"Since it is the economies of the affected states that are being largely affected, the states should augment the compensation as they did during the 1st outbreak years ago. The states should specifically help in the design of poultry farms to encourage bio-security of the farms," he explained.

Ahmed particularly warned against cluster farms, and blamed that trend for the large number of birds that had to be destroyed.

The NVRI boss singled out Plateau and Kano as states with the largest concentration of cluster farms and explained that the flu usually spreads faster and engulfs more birds in cluster farms. He expressed satisfaction that the flu was contained in a few months compared to the 1st outbreak, which lasted from 2006-2008, but observed that more birds were destroyed this time.

"More birds had to go because the production of poultry has changed with the cluster farms. In Rantya, a village in Jos South Local Government, for instance, the cluster farms are very close and heavily concentrated in one vicinity," he said. Ahmed said that the disease had subsided but "certainly was not over yet."

"We are not taking anything for granted and have, therefore, gone into active surveillance. We have already trained people to take samples; their task is to buy and test chickens randomly from farms and live bird markets all over the nation. We are virtually out of the passive, so we must go to look for possible cases. There are states and federal offices and officers to handle surveillance even in the remotest of the rural settlements. Such surveillance is usually the most expensive part of disease control, but Nigeria is being supported by some interventions from the World Bank, FAO, USAID and other development partners."

Ahmed said that the Federal Government was also carrying out forensic investigation to ascertain how the disease came in. "We are forced to do that because what was diagnosed in NVRI laboratories is not related to previous cases; it is a new introduction all together," [he] explained.

He said that there were many speculations, with humans suspected to be possible carriers, while poultry importations could also be a source of disease dissemination.

Ahmed, however, expressed happiness that no human case had been found, saying that people tested, including farm workers, proved negative.

The NVRI boss disclosed that another poultry disease, Newcastle disease, was being zeroed in on for eradication by the international community through vaccinations like Thermostable and MDV12, which are usually targeted at poultry farmers in the hinterlands.

[Nigeria has reported to the OIE during 2015 2 separate HPAI H5N1 epizootics within its territory, which are at present officially regarded as "continuing." The 1st one, which reportedly started on 24 Dec 2014, is located in south and southwest Nigeria. So far, a total of 16 outbreaks have been reported within the framework of this epizootic. The most recent follow-up report, No. 6, was submitted to the OIE on 13 May 2015, reporting 2 new outbreaks of which one was in Lagos State and the other one in Rivers. This and previous reports, as well as a map showing the 16 infected locations, are available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=16977.

The 2nd and larger epizootic reportedly started on 2 Jan 2015 and has since spread within northern and central Nigeria (Kano, Plateau and Bauchi states), causing 169 (reported) outbreaks so far. The most recent follow-up report (No. 8) addressing this epizootic was submitted on 7 Jul 2015, reporting 46 "new" outbreaks (in fact, they took place during March-April 2015), all in the Plateau province. All reports addressing this epizootic since its start, and a map showing the 169 infected locations as of 7 Jul 2015, are available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=16926.

The disease has been spreading into and within other West African countries since early 2015, so far reported from Burkina Faso, Cote d'Ivoire, Niger and Ghana; see interactive map at http://tinyurl.com/o9el63k (click on the West African cluster; zoom in). - Mod.AS
