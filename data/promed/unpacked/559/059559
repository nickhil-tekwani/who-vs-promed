China reported 2 new cases of African swine fever [ASF] on Friday [21 Sep 2018], as the deadly disease continued to spread to new areas in the world's top pork producer.

One case occurred on a farm of 484 pigs in the city of Gongzhuling in Jilin province in the northeast of China, killing 56 pigs, said the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs. This is the 1st outbreak of the disease in the province. A 2nd case in the Horqin Right Banner area of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region killed 22 pigs on a farm of 138 animals, the ministry added in the statement on its website.

China has reported close to 20 outbreaks of the disease in 8 provinces in less than 2 months, with new cases being reported each week. It has banned the transport of live hogs and pig products from 16 provinces and regions, shut live markets, and banned the use of feed derived from pig blood in an effort to control the spread of the disease. But it is still struggling to contain the spread, said state news agency Xinhua on Friday [21 Sep 2018], blaming the lack of manpower and financial resources at local levels to prevent and tackle animal disease.

County-level animal health supervision agencies have an average of less than 10 people, it said, adding that law enforcement by the officials was "seriously insufficient." It urged relevant departments to boost resources at the local level to improve prevention and controls of animal disease.

[This new outbreak, adding an 8th Chinese province to the list of ASF-infected provinces in northeastern and eastern China, has already been reported to the OIE. The "immediate report," with a map, is available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=28033.

On Thu 13 Sep 2018, China's Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs (MoARA) jointly issued the "notice on the implementation of compulsory culling, compensation for African swine fever"; the compensation for the compulsory culling was raised from CNY 800/head [about USD 117] to CNY 1200/head [about USD 175].

Also on Thu 13 Sep 2018, MoARA issued notice no. 64, which temporarily suspended the use of swine blood for feed, prohibited swill feeding in ASF-affected provinces and their neighbouring provinces, and prohibited feeding swill without high-temperature treatment in other provinces (see http://www.moa.gov.cn/gk/tzgg_1/gg/201809/t20180913_6157350.htm).

On Fri 14 Sep 2018, MoARA organized an inter-ministerial coordination meeting on the prevention and control of ASF. The participating institutions were Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Public Security, Finance, Transport, Commerce, Development and Reform, Health and Family planning, as well as Banking Regulatory Commissions, General Administrations of Customs, Market Supervision, Forest and Grass Bureau, Civil Aviation Administration, Post Office, Logistics Support Department of the Central Military Commission, and China Railway.

In accordance with the notice of the State Council General Office (http://www.gov.cn/zhengce/2018-09/01/content_5318271.htm), the ministries will enhance the joint prevention and control mechanism (http://www.moa.gov.cn/xw/zwdt/201809/t20180914_6157401.htm).
