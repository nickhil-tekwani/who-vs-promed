U.S. not ready to reopen border without more potato wart study
------------------------------------------------------------------------
USDA officials say it's too early to say what measures, if any, will
persuade them to lift the [indefinite ban against imports of potatoes from
P.E.I. The ban [is in response to the discovery of potato wart [disease
in the New Annan area.
Kim Smith, a spokesperson with the USDA in Riverdale, Maryland, said
American and Canadian agriculture officials haven't decided what steps need
to be taken before the border will be reopened.
In Charlottetown Wednesday, Potato Board manager Ivan Noonan, [provincial
Agriculture Minister Mitch Murphy, Don Love, regional director of the
Canadian Food Inspection Agency, and plant health expert Dr. Ken Proudfoot
[met to explain their efforts to contain the fungal invasion and to regain
access to the American [market. Proudfoot said the steps taken so far,
[cessation of harvesting, processing of affected potatoes, and disinfection
of all harvesting equipment should help contain the disease.
Scientists are [analyzing 400 soil samples from the [infested field for
presence of potato wart spores and [surrounding fields are being surveyed
for evidence of spread. Proudfoot [indicated that the outbreak may be
confined to a localized area.
Murphy said the province is hoping to use a quarantine to make sure the
disease is kept to the affected field. [He said a cover crop will likely be
planted in order to hold the soil in place.
Potato wart [had been found [earlier in home gardens in Pennsylvania,
West Virginia and Maryland but has since been considered eradicated [from
the North American mainland. The disease is found in Newfoundland and is
also common in the Netherlands, [the center of the world's largest seed
potato industry.

[Exports from P.E.I. to the U.S. market will be on hold so long as U.S.
officials perceive that potato wart is a danger to potato production in the
U.S.A. I expect that a great deal of testing of soil and tubers will be
required before the perception is changed. The ball is in their court.
For history buffs, J. C. Walker's text book (Plant Pathology, published in
1950) mentions that the first occurrence of the disease in North America
was in the then British colony of Newfoundland and neighboring islands in
1909. Subsequently it was reported in Canada in 1918 and later in a home
garden in 1941 at Halifax. It appeared in the U.S.A in 1918 (Pennsylvania)
and later in West Virginia and Maryland, but has not recurred since.
