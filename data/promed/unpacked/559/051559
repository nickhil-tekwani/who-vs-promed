A measles outbreak is growing in Brazil after cases were imported from neighboring Venezuela where health services have collapsed. More than 460 cases of the disease have been confirmed in 2 Brazilian border states. There are also concerns that the outbreak has reached an isolated tribe that lives in the Amazon that has little resistance to such diseases [See ProMED-mail. Measles update (41): Americas, Europe, Pacific 20180709.5895186].

The cases in Brazil come after the World Health Organization [WHO] declared the Americas measles-free in 2016. But outbreaks can still occur even after a country is declared free because cases can be imported. That's just what has happened in Brazil, where the disease slipped across the border with people fleeing economic and political collapse in neighboring Venezuela.

Measles spreads through the air and is highly contagious. While there is no specific treatment for the disease, the vaccine is very effective. Symptoms of measles include fever, runny nose, cough, sore throat and a rash that spreads over the body.

Last year [2017], measles started spreading in Venezuela, where there have been more than 2000 cases. Oil-rich Venezuela was once wealthy, and the health system there was a model for the region. But mismanagement and a fall in oil prices have led to widespread shortages of everything from food to medicine. Doctors have fled, and health services have collapsed. Hardships in general in Venezuela have sent more than one million people fleeing to neighboring countries, sometimes bringing disease with them.

To combat the outbreak, authorities in Brazil are offering measles vaccinations to foreigners registering with the federal police and are also increasing efforts to ensure Brazilians are vaccinated. Brazilians should be vaccinated against measles as a matter of routine, but authorities have recently held special campaigns in Roraima and Amazonas to vaccinate those who slipped through the system.

Beyond the usual concerns of containing the extremely contagious disease, Survival International said an outbreak could devastate the isolated Yanomami tribe, which lives on both sides of the Brazil-Venezuela border, deep in the Amazon. So far, 23 Yanomami with measles symptoms have sought medical treatment in Brazil, the indigenous rights organization said, and one of those cases has been confirmed. Many more could be sick in Venezuela, where Survival International said it is harder to get information.

Brazilian authorities confirmed today [6 Jul 2018] that a 7 month old baby had died of measles in the city of Manaus, capital of the state of Amazonas (north), so that the number of victims of this disease has risen to 3 in recent months. The baby, who had not been vaccinated, died on 28 Jun 2018, but the causes were confirmed Thu [6 Jul 2018] by the Ministry of Health of Manaus, a city that has decreed a state of emergency after a new outbreak of measles.

Only in Manaus, 270 cases of this infectious disease caused by morbillivirus have been confirmed since March 2018, particularly among children.

The increase in suspected cases increases the possibility of dissemination to other states of the country and puts at risk the commitments for the maintenance of the certificate of elimination of the measles virus in the regions of the Americas, notes the secretariat.

In addition to Amazonas, the state of Roraima -- also in the northern region of the country -- has recorded 2 measles deaths in recent months.

In 2017, measles cases rose by 400 per cent in Europe. Last February 2018, WHO warned of the rise of measles in Europe in 2017, with 35 deaths and 21 315 cases, 400 per cent more than in 2016, when a historical minimum was reported with 5273 cases. A total of 15 of the 53 countries that make up the European region of the WHO suffered a "big outbreak" of measles in the last year, with Romania heading the list with 5562 cases, followed by Italy with 5006 and Ukraine with 4767 cases.

After these 3 countries, the others that experienced outbreaks were Greece (927 cases), Germany (927), Serbia (702), Tajikistan (649), France (520), Russia (408), Belgium (369), United Kingdom (282), Bulgaria (167), Spain (152), Czech Republic (146) and Switzerland (105), although many of them were decreasing at the end of 2017.

"More than 20 000 cases of measles and 35 lives lost in 2017 alone is a tragedy that we simply cannot accept," said WHO regional director for Europe Zsuzsanna Jakab in a statement published in the framework of the ministerial meeting on health about immunization held in Montenegro. "Every new person affected by measles in Europe reminds us that unvaccinated children and adults, regardless of where they live, are still at risk of contracting the disease and spreading it to others who may not be able to get vaccinated," she added.

Researchers have urged the governments of Brazil and Venezuela to offer emergency medical attention and protect the Yanomamis. Brazilian health authorities have reported 67 cases of measles, including one baby dead among Yanomami natives on the Venezuelan border, and labelled the situation as "catastrophic". The situation is by no means under control.

Of the total number of people infected with measles, 60 are Venezuelans, said Manoel Pereira, technical manager of the programme of immunization and immuno-preventable diseases of the Special Sanitary District of the Yanomami of Brazil. Authorities are investigating another 9 cases for suspected measles. So far, the only recorded death among the Indians is that of a 9 month old Brazilian baby, Pereira said in a telephone interview with a French news agency.

The disease is attacking especially indigenous Sanuma, a subgroup of the Yanomami ethnic group living in the border region. An estimated 3873 indigenous people live in the area with the largest number of reported cases.

Sarah Shenker, a senior researcher at the human rights organization Survival International, said deaths were also reported on the Venezuelan side, which also appear to be measles-related. "This outbreak could be catastrophic for the Yanomami," the researcher added, urging "the Venezuelan and Brazilian governments to offer emergency medical attention to prevent more deaths and protect the Yanomami lands from invaders to guarantee their survival."

The cases were recorded between March and June 2018. Although this Saturday marks 34 days without notifications, Pereira stressed that this does not mean that the situation is under control.

[See ProMED-mail. Measles update (41): Americas, Europe, Pacific 20180709.5895186 for a discussion on the Yanomami tribe. The Sanuma, also referred to as Sanema, Sanima Tsanuma, Guaika, Samatari, Samatali, Xamatari and Chirichano in the literature, are an indigenous people of Brazil and Venezuela. They are related to the Yanomami. They number about 1500 and live on both sides of the border [Wikipedia].

Measles presents a potentially catastrophic threat to these indigenous people. It is critical that the Brazilian and Venezuelan governments provide vaccinations immediately and medical care to protect them. - Mod.LK

Multnomah County health officials Fri [13 Jul 2018] confirmed a 3rd case of measles in the Portland metro area. The person was unvaccinated and had been in close contact with a 2nd person diagnosed with measles 6 Jul 2018, according to health officials. Multnomah County Communicable Disease Services has alerted the individual and asked the person to stay home and away from other people.

The 3 cases in Multnomah County are in addition to a related but unconfirmed case in a young child that is under investigation in Clark County, Washington. Clark County health officials identified 3 locations where people may have been exposed and, on Fri [13 Jul], identified a 4th. [See URL above for locations where individuals may have been exposed to measles virus.]

Health officials note that the risk of exposure is incredibly low. The 1st case in Multnomah County was confirmed 27 Jun 2018. It was the 1st confirmed case in the Portland metro area since 2014. Despite the case confirmed, health officials don't believe anyone else has been exposed to measles in Multnomah County.

At least 3 children have been infected with measles in Multan on Sun [15 Jul 2018], Express News reported. Doctors at Children's Complex said that [children aged] 2 years, 3 years, and 9 months were admitted to the health facility after catching the virus. They said all the patients were being provided treatment and were being kept in the isolation ward at the hospital.

Earlier, a report released by WHO revealed that 5871 cases of measles were reported in Pakistan in 2016. The figure almost doubled in 2017 to 10 540 cases, while laboratory tests confirmed 2806 and 6437 reported cases in 2016 and 2017, respectively.

According to WHO standards, 95 per cent vaccine coverage is the rate necessary to avert an outbreak, as the disease is highly infectious. Even reaching an 80 per cent coverage threshold will avert large-scale outbreaks.

Last year [2017], a meeting conducted by the Pakistan Health and Population Strategic Forum, chaired by federal minister for national health services Saira Afzal Tarar, took notice of the measles situation. She agreed to launch a nationwide anti-measles drive in October 2018. They also decided to release a plan of action with mutual consultation among all provinces.
