Acute hepatitis outbreak swells to nearly 900 cases; global data shows 'mixed picture'
--------------------------------------------------------------------
An outbreak of acute, severe hepatitis of unknown etiology in children has grown to 894 cases across 33 countries, according to data presented during a media briefing at the International Liver Congress. "As of 20 June 2022, we now have 894 probable cases reported in 33 countries in 5 WHO regions," Philippa Easterbrook, senior scientist at the Global HIV, Hepatitis and STI Programs at WHO headquarters in Geneva, told attendees. "Since the last WHO public communication on 27 May 2022, this represents 244 additional cases over a space of about a month. However, it's important to remember that this includes both new cases as well as retrospectively identified cases."

Easterbrook noted that more than half of these cases (n = 449) are from the European region, with the UK alone accounting for 262 cases -- nearly 30% of the global total. The 2nd highest reporting region are the Americas with 368 cases; as with the UK, the USA harbors a disproportionate number of cases at 290, or 35% of the global total.

"Together the USA and the UK account for 65% of the global total cases," she said. "The majority of cases -- 75% -- are among children less than 5 years of age. Forty-four children have required liver transplantation, and there have been 18 reported deaths. Fortunately, in both the European and American data, there does appear to be a declining trajectory in terms of reports of new cases, which is a positive development."

Early in the investigation, adenovirus along with past or current COVID-19 infection were the primary suspects "and that is still the case," Easterbrook remarked, noting that these viruses are likely independent or collaborative causes that result in hepatitis. "Adenovirus remains the most detected of all viral infections with a rate of detection of about 53% across Europe and bit higher in the UK, but they are not in all cases," she said. "There does seem to be a higher rate of detection in the younger age groups and in those developing severe disease, so perhaps there is some link to severity."

In terms of current COVID infection, in both Europe and the USA rates of detection are approximately 10%, which is what researchers expect, given the rate of transmission in the general population around that time. "Some of the emerging hypotheses are [whether this outbreak] represents a post-COVID phenomenon," she said. "Is this a variant of the rare but recognized multisystem inflammatory syndrome condition in children? It often occurs 1 to 2 months after COVID-19, causing widespread organ damage, but it is rare, and the cases of hepatitis that have been reported don't seem to fit those features."

However, Easterbrook noted that early on researchers were able to rule out COVID-19 vaccination as a potential contributor. "The majority of children [in these cases] had not been vaccinated, particularly the younger age groups, consistent with the vaccination policy in place at the time," she said. "The clear message is 85% were unvaccinated, which is why that cause was excluded."

For Easterbrook, the steady growth in cases and a still unknown etiology have highlighted the importance of capturing consistent data from multiple countries. "We are seeing a somewhat mixed picture globally, with 2 countries reporting the majority of cases in large numbers," she said. "We are seeing differences in age distribution; we are seeing some differences in the rate of adenovirus detection and COVID-19. It's a mixed picture, and we really need to have good quality data collected in a standardized way from other countries."

Technical report: acute hepatitis of unknown cause
--------------------------------------------------
This is a technical report intended for scientific audiences. Additional information, including materials targeted to the general public, are available at https://www.cdc.gov/ncird/investigation/hepatitis-unknown-cause/index.html.

Executive summary
-----------------
This report reviews what is currently known about acute hepatitis with unknown cause in children under the age of 11 years, and describes the investigations that CDC and state, local, tribal, and territorial partners are conducting.

As of 15 Jun 2022, 290 patients under investigation (PUIs) have been reported in 41 states and territories, with dates of onset on or after 1 Oct 2021. The median age of PUIs is 2 years. To date, 17 (6%) PUIs have required a liver transplant, and 11 (4%) have died; cause of death is under investigation. In the week prior to 15 Jun 2022, 16 additional PUIs were reported. However, only 9 PUIs experienced symptom onset between 1-15 Jun 2022.

The current PUI definition is:
- Patient under investigation: Children < 10 years of age with elevated (> 500 U/L) aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) who have an unknown etiology for their hepatitis (with or without any adenovirus testing results, irrespective of the results) since 1 Oct 2021

CDC is investigating several etiological hypotheses, notably a possible association with any adenovirus infection, and specifically type 41 infection. Of the 236 PUIs for whom adenovirus testing was conducted on any specimen type (blood, respiratory specimens, stool), 45% were found to be positive for adenovirus. Additional hypotheses, including a possible association with current or previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, or other viruses, are also being evaluated. Details on the leading hypotheses, planned investigations, and what is known to date are available below.

Clinical providers caring for children with hepatitis of unknown etiology should refer to the latest guidance available. Guidance on adenovirus testing, typing, and testing submission is also available.

Disease background
------------------
Hepatitis is inflammation of the liver. Its causes include viral infections, alcohol use, toxins, medications, and certain medical conditions. In the USA, the commonest causes of viral hepatitis are hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C viruses [2]. Signs and symptoms of hepatitis include fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dark urine, light-colored stools, joint pain, and jaundice [2]. Treatment of hepatitis depends on the underlying etiology.

Adenoviruses are doubled-stranded DNA viruses that spread by close personal contact, respiratory droplets, and fomites [3]. There are more than 50 types of immunologically distinct adenoviruses that can cause infections in humans. Adenoviruses most commonly cause respiratory illness, but some adenovirus types can cause other illnesses such as gastroenteritis, conjunctivitis, cystitis, and, less commonly, neurological disease [3]. There is no specific treatment for adenovirus infections.

Adenovirus type 41 commonly causes acute gastroenteritis in children, which typically presents as diarrhea, vomiting, and fever; it is often accompanied by respiratory symptoms [4]. While there have been case reports of hepatitis in immunocompromised children associated with adenovirus type 41 infection, adenovirus type 41 is not known to be a cause of hepatitis in otherwise healthy children [5,6].

Epidemiological data by geographic area
---------------------------------------
International:
Globally, the WHO is reporting 650 probable cases from 33 countries in 5 WHO regions, with an additional 99 cases pending classification as of 26 May 2022. The majority of reported cases are from the WHO European Region (n = 374), followed by the Region of the Americas (n = 240), Western Pacific Region (n = 34), the South East Asia Region (n = 14), and Eastern Mediterranean Region (n = 5).

As of 9 Jun 2022, The European Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has received reports of 402 cases in 20 countries. Of the 192 cases for which this information was available, 17 (8.9%) have received a liver transplant. Overall, 293 cases were tested for adenovirus by any specimen type and had a valid positive or negative result. Of these, 158 (53.9%) tested positive. Of the 273 cases PCR tested for SARS-CoV-2, 29 (10.6%) tested positive. Additional information can be found on the ECDC website.

As of 7 Jun 2022, the UK is reporting 240 cases with onset dates between 1 Jan 2022, to present. Among 170 cases tested for adenovirus, 116 (68%) are positive. Of 169 PUIs tested for acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, 25 (15%) have tested positive. Additional data from the UK are available on the UKHSA website.

Summary data of patients under investigation in the USA:
As of 15 Jun 2022, 290 patients under investigation (PUIs) have been reported from 41 jurisdictions. In the last week, 16 additional PUI have been reported. However, many of the newly reported PUIs had historical admissions that were identified retrospectively. The states reporting patients under investigation include: AL, AR, AZ, CA, CO, CT, DE, FL, GA, HI, ID, IL, IN, KY, LA, MA, MD, ME, MI, MN, MO, MS, NC, ND, NE, NJ, NM, NV, NY, OH, OK, PA, PR, RI, SD, TN, TX, UT, VA, WA, WI

The median age of PUIs is 2 years (0-9 years), and 48% of PUIs are male.

Of the patients under investigation, 17 (6%) have required a liver transplant. Eleven deaths are under investigation.

Reported patients under investigation with hepatitis of unknown etiology by week of onset October 2021-15 Jun 2022 (n = 278)
-------------------------------------------------------

[for figure, see original URL. The date of onset is stated to be onset of hepatitis -- unclear if that means onset of symptoms or 1st finding of markedly elevated aminotransferases. - Mod.LL]

Of the 236 (81%) of PUIs with adenovirus testing on at least 1 specimen type (whole blood, plasma, serum, respiratory, stool), 45% were found to have adenovirus. Typing data is available for 16 PUIs; 10/16 were type 41, 1/16 was type 40, and 5 PUIs were other types (type 1 (n = 3), type 2 (n = 1), type 5 (n = 1)).

As reported in a recent MMWR, adenovirus was detected in the 9 children with acute hepatitis initially reported in Alabama between October 2021 and February 2022 [1]. High fidelity sequencing data for adenovirus typing was obtained for 5 patients, all of which were identified as adenovirus 41.

Hypotheses under investigation
------------------------------
CDC is investigating several etiologic hypotheses, notably a possible association with adenovirus infection, and specifically type 41 infection. Of the 236 patients under investigation for whom adenovirus testing was conducted on any specimen type (blood, respiratory, stool), 45% are positive for adenovirus. Ongoing and planned investigations include adenovirus testing, including typing and genome sequencing, for all PUIs with adequate specimens. This will facilitate understanding of the range of adenoviruses associated with acute hepatitis and if adenovirus is a previously unrecognized cause of pediatric hepatitis in non-immunocompromised children.

Selected additional etiologic possibilities include:
- Do some children, due to age or other factors, exhibit an atypical response to their first adenovirus (or other viral) infection which results in hepatitis? Pandemic mitigation measures have likely resulted in a large cohort of young children with minimal exposure to viral illnesses usually experienced in the 1st several years of life. Return to regular activities may have resulted in a larger than usual number of 1st infections, and at an older age than expected.

- Are multiple factors contributing to the illnesses seen among reported PUIs, as opposed to one primary driver? 30-50% [7-9] of liver failure in children is idiopathic; there are multiple known and unknown pathways to acute liver failure in children.

- Is acute hepatitis in children due to a combination of persistent or prior infection with SARS-CoV-2 (or other viruses) and adenovirus, causing an autoimmune phenomenon or superantigen reaction? Prevalence of an active SARS-CoV-2 infection is ~10% among PUIs for whom data is available, and up to 1/3 report history of prior COVID-19 infection. Testing for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies to confirm prior infections, as well as testing for viruses is ongoing.

- Is acute hepatitis in children a manifestation of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C), an inflammatory condition that develops in a small proportion of children after infection with SARS-CoV- 2? MIS-C associated with COVID-19 most often presents with cardiac or renal organ involvement, but occasionally signs of hepatitis. Among over 8000 US patients with MIS-C, < 1% developed liver failure and nearly all were secondary to shock.

- Is pediatric acute hepatitis caused by an environmental trigger or ingested toxin? Although epidemiological investigations are still underway for the majority of PUIs, no associations have been found with pets, food, medication, toxins, or other exposures evaluated. However, this is analysis is preliminary and may change as additional information becomes available.

Trends in surveillance data
---------------------------
Analyses of 4 data sources did not indicate recent increases in hepatitis-associated ED visits or hospitalizations, liver transplants, or adenovirus 40/41 percent positivity among US children compared with pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels. Additional analyses to establish baseline disease trends are presented in an MMWR publication.

Trends in emergency department visits by children for acute hepatitis are largely stable for children birth through 4 years and 5 through 11 years of age based on National Syndromic Surveillance Program data from January 2018 to March 2022.

Liver transplants in the US among children aged < 18 years do not demonstrate an increase since October 2021, compared with pre-pandemic levels in the Organ Procurement and Transplant Network.

Hospitalizations consistent with acute hepatitis among children from birth-4 years and 5-11 years do not demonstrate an increase since October 2021, compared with expected levels based on diagnostic codes in Premier Healthcare Database.

Data from a large national commercial laboratory, by age birth-4 years and 5-9 years, does not show an increase in the percent positive for adenovirus 40/41 for 2021/2022 compared to 2019.

Investigations
--------------
Identifying the cause of acute hepatitis among children remains a high priority. CDC and partners are conducting extensive laboratory testing, including for adenovirus infection, and planning epidemiological and laboratory studies to examine the etiological hypotheses under investigation.

The following investigations are planned, ongoing or completed:
[See original URL - Mod.LL]

Risk assessment (based on time of publication)
----------------------------------------------
At this time, the incidence of acute hepatitis in children is not higher than pre-pandemic baseline levels, and severe outcomes are infrequent. Investigations are ongoing to better understand cases of acute hepatitis of unknown etiology in children. CDC encourages parents and caregivers to be aware of the symptoms of hepatitis -- particularly jaundice, which is a yellowing of the skin or eyes -- and to contact their child's healthcare provider if present.

Limitations of the report
-------------------------
Adenoviruses are very common in humans and typically cause only mild illness. Few surveillance systems exist in the United States to detect adenovirus infections or distinguish it from the other pathogens that cause mild upper respiratory or gastrointestinal disease. CDC has leveraged existing data sources to define the burden of hepatitis and evaluate secular trends. Hepatitis Emergency Department and hospitalization data are based on discharge diagnosis codes that have not been extensively validated. All data are preliminary and may change as more reports are received.

[An epicurve for onset of hepatitis (not necessarily onset of symptoms) is now reported for the US data, but there is not substantial data regarding past SARS-CoV-2 infection in American children affected and little overall in patients worldwide. Although CDC is not releasing individual state numbers "to protect patient privacy", individual state numbers do come out. Numbers per state are published by CDC for other infections such as the US nationwide hepatitis A virus outbreak. The etiology or etiologies of this severe liver inflammation remain unclear, although adenovirus and SARS-CoV-2 remain in the equation, separately or together. While aminotransferases of > 500 is part of the case definition, the height of these assays does not necessarily correlate with severity as such patients can be without jaundice and may be totally asymptomatic. There remains little information about asymptomatic hepatitis in sibling or adult contacts. - Mod.LL]
