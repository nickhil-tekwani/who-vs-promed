After months of debate and public furor over experiments that made a dangerous flu virus more contagious [see ProMED-mail archived reports below], a panel of scientific advisers reversed itself on Friday [30 Mar 2012] and recommended that details of the research be published in full in scientific journals.

The panel, the National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity, had originally recommended in December [2011] that scientific reports about the research be published only if certain details were withheld, to prevent others from replicating the experiments. The fear was that bioterrorists would use the information to create germ weapons. There was also concern by some scientists that the virus would leak out of a laboratory by accident and start a pandemic.

The December [2011] recommendation was the 1st time that the biosecurity panel had ever advised keeping details of biological research secret. In a statement issued on Friday [30 Mar 2012], the board said that the reports had been revised and that the data in them "did not appear to provide information that would immediately enable misuse of the research in ways that would endanger public health or national security." In addition, it said new data has emerged indicating that understanding the precise genetic changes that increase contagiousness in flu viruses could improve scientists' ability to monitor viruses in the environment and identify those with the most potential danger.

The experiments involve a type of bird flu virus known as H5N1 [avian influenza A/(H5N1) virus]. It does not often infect people but appears unusually deadly when it does. People almost never transmit the virus to one another, but if the virus were to become transmissible, deadly pandemics could ensue. The experiments in question studied the virus in ferrets, considered a good model for the way flu viruses affect people. In the course of studying transmissibility, the research teams created a strain of the virus that could spread through the air from one animal to another, something that had not existed before.

The work, paid for by the National Institutes of Health, was done by 2 separate research teams, at Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam, in the Netherlands, and at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. In January [2012], the scientists voluntarily suspended research on the viruses because of the uproar it provoked. The moratorium was to last 2 months, but the World Health Organization said in February 2012 that it would probably be extended for a few more months.

A federal advisory board today [30 Mar 2012] reversed its stance on publishing 2 controversial H5N1 transmission papers, recommending that both studies be published in full. The National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity (NSABB) met yesterday and today [29-30 Mar 2012] to discuss revised versions of the studies by 2 groups, one from the University of Wisconsin, Madison and one from Erasmus University in the Netherlands. Both studies were funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and, as its dual-use advisory board, the NSABB in December [2011] recommended redacting the studies due to bio-terror concerns and the risk of an unintentional release of the viruses used in the 2 ferret studies. The 2 journals slated to publish the studies, Science and Nature, have held off on running the papers based on the NSABB's nonbinding recommendation, which the NIH agreed with in December 2011.

In a statement released today [30 Mar 2012], the NSABB said it unanimously recommended that the revised manuscript by the University of Wisconsin group, headed by Yoshihiro Kawaoka, DVM, PhD, be published in full, and members voted 12 to 6 that the data, methods, and conclusions in the revised paper by the Erasmus group, headed by Ron Fouchier, PhD, be published.

Today's [30 Mar 2012] action by the NSABB follows yesterday's launch of a new government policy on the oversight of federally funded life sciences dual-use research. The new policy requires federal agencies to routinely review the risks of research conducted on 15 "high consequence" pathogens and toxins, including highly pathogenic H5N1 avian flu. In its statement, the NSABB said it strongly supports free communication of research information unless it poses significant and immediate risks to public health and safety. "While the communication of information in these manuscripts still presents dual-use concerns, the additional information changed the board's risk-benefit calculation," it said.

More specifically, the board said that data in the revised manuscripts don't appear to provide information that would immediately enable misuse in ways that would threaten public health. The NSABB also said new evidence has emerged that "underscores the fact that understanding specific mutations may improve international surveillance and public health and safety." The group did not elaborate on the new evidence.

"Global cooperation, critical for pandemic influenza preparedness efforts, is predicated upon the free sharing of information and was a fundamental principle in evaluating these manuscripts," the NSABB added. It concluded, "The NSABB recommendations from this meeting will be forwarded to the US government for review and consideration." The board noted that its recommendations were informed by the new dual-use oversight policy that was announced yesterday [29 Mar 2012]. The group emphasized that better processes for responsibly communicating dual-use research urgently need to be developed. On 3-4 Apr 2012, a Royal Society conference in London will address various aspects of the H5N1 research issues, and the World Health Organization (WHO) has said it will host a 2nd meeting on the H5N1 issues in the middle of the summer [2012].

Kawaoka's team combined the hemagglutinin from an H5N1 virus with other genes from an H1N1 virus and found that the hybrid could spread in ferrets via respiratory droplets, although it did not kill any of them. Fouchier's group used genetic engineering and passaging through ferrets to generate an H5N1 virus that spread via the airborne route among ferrets. Accounts of the virus's lethality have differed somewhat, but it was at least lethal to ferrets with deliberate tracheal inoculation at high doses.
