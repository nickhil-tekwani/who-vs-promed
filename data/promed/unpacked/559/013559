Public Health Dispatch:
Outbreak of Acute Febrile Illness Among Participants in EcoChallenge Sabah
2000 Malaysia, 2000
On 7 Sep 2000, CDC was notified by Idaho Department of Health about a case
of acute febrile illness in a 35-year-old man; the illness was
characterized by acute onset of high fever, chills, headache, and myalgias.
The patient had participated in the EcoChallenge Sabah 2000 Expedition
Race, a multisport event held during 20 Aug to 3 Sep 2000, at various sites
in Sabah in Malaysian Borneo.
This report presents preliminary findings of an ongoing investigation to
identify cases of acute febrile illness among athletes who participated in
the EcoChallenge Race in Borneo during Aug 2000. Preliminary laboratory
test results indicate the probable cause of illness to be leptospirosis, a
spirochete infection. The event involved jungle trekking, open water
swimming, river and ocean paddling, mountain biking, canyoneering, scuba
diving, and spelunking. Participating were 76 4-person teams from 26
countries, including 37 teams from the United States. Subsequently, 9 other
EcoChallenge participants who became ill were identified in California (5
in San Diego County, 2 in Orange County, and 2 in Los Angeles). To identify
additional athletes with febrile illness, an EcoChallenge participant list
was obtained from race organizers, and a telephone survey was administered
by CDC with the assistance of several state public health departments. As
of 13 Sep 2000, 82 (53%) of 155 U.S.-based athletes have been contacted; 37
(45%) reported having fever and 12 (15%) were hospitalized. No deaths have
been reported.
On 12 Sep 2000, serum specimens obtained from 2 hospitalized athletes from
Los Angeles were tested at CDC for leptospirosis using the Dip-S-Ticks*
assay (_Leptospira_ INDX Dip-S-Ticks; Integrated Diagnostics, Baltimore,
Maryland) and the Pan-Bio* enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) IgM
test (PanBio, Brisbane, Australia). One athlete tested positive with both
tests on an acute-phase serum specimen obtained 4 days following onset of
fever. The second athlete tested negative with both tests on the
acute-phase specimen but positive with both tests on a follow-up specimen
obtained 4 and 6 days following onset of fever.
On the basis of laboratory test results and the clinical features of
illness, CDC advises the following to clinicians caring for EcoChallenge
participants. First, asymptomatic athletes that were taking
chemoprophylaxis for leptospirosis (i.e., 200 mg oral doxycycline weekly)
should ensure that their final weekly dose was taken following completion
of the race (1). Second, although the merits of one dose of postexposure
chemoprophylaxis with 200 mg oral doxycycline are unknown, asymptomatic
athletes who participated in the race and who were not taking
chemoprophylaxis for leptospirosis may wish to discuss the single-dose
option with their physician. Third, for athletes with mild symptoms
consistent with leptospirosis, treatment should include 7 days of oral
doxycycline, 100 mg twice daily (2). Finally, for hospitalized patients
with severe illness (e.g., persistent high-grade fever, impaired hepatic or
renal function, or severe neurologic disturbances, including coma,
hemiplegia, or transverse myelitis), treatment should include 7 days of
intravenous penicillin G, 1.5 million units every 6 hours (3). As with
other spirochete infections, a Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction can develop
following the initiation of penicillin therapy for leptospirosis (4).
Although these reactions serve as an indicator of therapeutic efficacy,
they can be associated with increased morbidity and mortality; patients
receiving intravenous penicillin should be monitored for shocklike
symptoms. On September 13, CDC issued an advisory
<http://webdev.cdc.gov/travel/other/lepto-malaysia.htm> about the probable
leptospirosis outbreak associated with the EcoChallenge event to raise
awareness among health-care workers and participants of the event in
Borneo. The Meningitis and Special Pathogens Branch (MSPB) at CDC is
interested in receiving reports through state and local health departments
of additional participants who have been ill or have had fever since 21 Aug
2000. In addition, MSPB will test clinical specimens for leptospirosis
received through state and local health departments.

[This report provides the first serologic evidence of leptospirosis in this
outbreak and data indicating that there is a high attack rate among the
participants of the EcoChallenge Race. We would be interested to learn the
progress of epidemiologic investigations that are ongoing in other
countries as well. -Man. Ed. DS
