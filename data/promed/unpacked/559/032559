Today [8 Apr 2013] the Mississippi State Department of Health (MSDH) reports the state's 1st human case of West Nile virus (WNV) for 2013. The reported case is in Madison County. The MSDH only reports laboratory-confirmed cases to the public. In 2012, Mississippi had 247 WNV cases and 5 deaths.

"This is actually not the 1st time we have had cases reported this early in Mississippi. We have had cases in March before and as early as January in previous years. This serves as a reminder that WNV [transmission] can occur year-round, even if we are not in the peak summer months of July, August, and September," said MSDH Deputy State Epidemiologist Dr Paul Byers. "Also, the timeframe of when the 1st case is reported has no effect on the type of WNV activity we'll see in a particular season. The 1st cases of the 2012 were reported in June, and we went on to set a record for the highest number of human cases in one season."

Mississippians should take appropriate precautions to reduce the risk of contracting WNV [infections] and other mosquito-borne illnesses year-round: remove sources of standing water, especially after rainfall; if you will be in mosquito-prone areas, wear protective clothing (such as long-sleeved shirts and pants) during peak times from dusk until dawn; and use a recommended mosquito repellent according to manufacturer's directions.

Symptoms of WNV infection are often mild and may include fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, a rash, muscle weakness, or swollen lymph nodes. In a small number of cases, infection can result in encephalitis or meningitis, which can lead to paralysis, coma, and possibly death.

[Although ProMED-mail no longer posts reports of isolated human or equine animal WNV infections in North America because the virus has become endemic in the continental USA and southern Canada, since this is a very early case for 2013, the warning issued in the report above is worth heeding throughout the WNV geographic range. Owners should make sure that vaccinations of their equine animals are current.
