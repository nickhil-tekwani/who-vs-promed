Suspected acute hemorrhagic fever syndrome in the Republic of the Congo
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
A team from the Congolese Ministry of Health, the Centre International de
Recherches Medicales de Franceville (CIRMF), and WHO is travelling to Mbomo
district, Cuvette Ouest region, to investigate rumours of suspected cases
of acute hemorrhagic fever syndrome. Laboratory samples will be collected
and tested by CIRMF in Gabon. In December 2002, mortality was observed in
gorillas and chimpanzees in the same area. Tests carried out by CIRMF
confirmed an etiology of Ebola.
