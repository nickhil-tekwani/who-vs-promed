30 cases of dengue fever, and 18 suspected cases, have been found since
September [2004] in East China's Fujian Province.
The 30 reported cases include 4 cases from outside the area; the others
were infected locally. So far, there have been no deaths since the 1st
outside case was found on 9 Sep 2004, according to a bulletin issued on
Thursday [14 Oct 2004] by the Health Department of the Fujian Provincial
Government. 16 patients have recovered and been released from hospital, the
bulletin said. Among the 4 outside cases, it has been proven that 3 were
infected while traveling: 2 in the Philippines and one in Cambodia.
All the patients are undergoing medical treatment in designated hospitals,
said a senior official with the department. 2 hospitals have been appointed
to offer special treatment to the dengue patients in Fuzhou, the capital of
the province.
The department has laid out a plan for the prevention and treatment of the
fever, stipulating that the relevant hospitals should report disease
updates to superior departments through the internet. To stop the disease
from spreading to the province from abroad, quarantine and inspection
stations have been requested to enhance sanitation supervision for ships,
airplanes, and containers coming from regions subject to dengue fever.
Because the disease has been rare in most regions of Fujian for the past
few years, many doctors are not familiar with the symptoms of the disease.
This led to wrong diagnoses when the disease 1st appeared, said an
emergency statement about dengue issued last month [September 2004] by the
province's Health Department.
Experts said that no vaccine is available for dengue at present. The most
effective way to prevent the disease is to wipe out mosquitoes. Since last
month [September 2004], the Fujian government has taken measures to
strengthen people's awareness of the disease and organized several mass
activities to kill mosquitoes in people's residential quarters.
Due to the province's frequent commerce with Southeast Asian areas -- and
that it shares with those areas similar climatic and geographical
conditions, and similar tropical and sub-tropical environments, which are
suitable for mosquitoes -- Fujian is considered a risky area into which the
disease will enter and spread. In 1999, the fever spread to several cities
in the province, and a few outside cases were found in 2000. There have
also been several dengue fever cases in coastal provinces, such as
Guangdong, as well as Taiwan, in recent years.

Large-scale dengue fever has erupted in many regions of Fuzhou, in China's
Fujian province. At least 100 people were infected, and the number of
patients is increasing. There are patients who have died, and this has
created panic among local people. The Fuzhou municipal government has
recently directed the city to wipe out mosquitoes, yet it has refused to
disclose the details of the current epidemic situation. However, an
anonymous official did admit that there was an outbreak of dengue fever.
According to Ming Pao (Ming Daily), the dengue fever epidemic in Fuzhou was
1st noted in early September [2004]. The 1st case originated from Cambodia.
The disease then spread virulently without warning. Nevertheless, only a
minority of superior officials in Fujian Province and Fuzhou city knew the
actual number of infected patients. Medical personnel estimated that the
infected patients totaled more than 100.
According to the public, the reason that the official refuses to shed light
on the wide-spread dengue epidemic, and the reason that the municipality
conceals it, is that they wish to prevent tarnishing the city's image in
the run-up to the upcoming International Man-Made Fiber Conference, which
will be held in Fuzhou.

[Unfortunately, it is not unusual for a country to play down the size of an
outbreak so as not to discourage foreign visitors. Experience has shown
that when there is a discrepancy in the numbers between an official report
and an independent source, the truth usually lies somewhere in between. -
