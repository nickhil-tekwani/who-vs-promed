Today [22 Jul 2008] it was confirmed that an 8-year-old boy has
cerebral death because of rabies after being bitten by a dog last
April [2008].

For the past 2 years, Jujuy province in Argentina has had an outbreak
of the disease, which, in spite of an intensive mass vaccination [of
dogs] campaign, has not been controlled yet.

The boy lived in Punta Diamante neighborhood, an area inhabited by
poor people, located in the junction of the Grande and Chico rivers,
in the provincial capital.

Mr Pedro Tacacho, a journalist from Radio Nacional in Jujuy, reported
the case to the media. He indicated that the case had been confirmed
by the Ministry of Health of the province.
