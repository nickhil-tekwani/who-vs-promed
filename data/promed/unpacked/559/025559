Pig infection, trichina worms, returns to Germany
-------------------------------------------------
Trichina worms, which infect pigs and cause a nasty rheumatic illness
in humans, have returned to Germany, animal-health officials north of
Berlin said Friday [21 Nov 2008]. Trichinosis infects people who have
[eaten] undercooked pork containing the nematodes.

The worms were found at a slaughterhouse in a pig from a private
home, veterinarian Holger Vogel said in Anklam. Many area
householders still keep pig-sties and raise pigs at home.

He said the worms appeared to have been spread by rodents from nearby
western Poland, where the nematodes are rife. It has spread to wild
animals in the Western Pomerania area. Decades ago, Germany wiped out
the disease in domestic animals, but it is still common in developing nations.

[The short-lived adult _Trichinella spiralis_ worms live in the small
intestine of host species including humans, pigs, rats, bears,
walruses, horses, many other flesh-eating mammals, and some birds and
reptiles. The parasite has a direct life cycle. Within hours
following consumption of infected muscle by a suitable host, 1st
stage muscle larvae (L1) are released by digestion and burrow into
the villi of the small intestine. They develop rapidly into adults
(males up to 1.8 mm long, females up to 3.7 mm long) and survive for
less than 2 months. During this time, copulation takes place and the
ovo-viviparous females release new-born larvae (NBL), which migrate
via venules and lymphatics into the general circulation.

NBL are distributed throughout the body where they invade striated
muscles, showing predilection for specific muscle groups. For
example, in pigs, the tongue usually contains the highest
concentration of larvae, followed by the diaphragm, and in horses,
the tongue followed by masseter muscle. Predilection sites vary by
host species, but in general, tongue, masseter and diaphragm are
optimal sites for sampling. In cases of severe infection most
voluntary muscles contain high numbers of larvae. The larvae of most
Trichinella species become encapsulated in collagen in host
musculature where they remain infective for years.

Diagnostic tests for trichinellosis fall into 2 categories:
1) direct detection of 1st-stage larvae encysted or free in striated
muscle tissue, and
2) indirect detection of infection by tests for specific antibodies.

Trichinellosis is an OIE listed disease, within the Multiple Species group.

According to OIE's WAHID animal disease interface, since 2005 Germany
reported 2 'outbreaks' of Trichinosis in wildlife (wild boars), one
each in 2006 and 2007. - Mod.AS]
