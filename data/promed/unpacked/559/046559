In September 2011, a female Israeli soldier 1st came to the hospital with a fever that had lasted 6 days, together with headache, muscle weakness and widespread rash. After she was released to her home, she returned 2 days later to another hospital with complaints of insomnia, vomiting and worsening headaches. She was discharged home again, but returned next day to the emergency room with weakness in the legs again, sitting in a wheelchair.

After she was released back to her home, she returned 2 days later in a hospital emergency room with shortness of breath, interfering with speech. Transferred to inpatient hospital intensive care unit in serious condition with multi-organ failure, and was diagnosed to have been infected with Israeli spotted fever. The soldier was released from the hospital and underwent lengthy rehabilitation before being returned to good health.

In emergency rooms, doctors are encouraged to be alert to the combination of 3 symptoms: fever, rash and headache/muscle ache. This disease may be severe, with a mortality rate due to 0.7 percent in estimates.

[Mediterranean spotted fever (MSF), also referred to as boutonneuse fever, is a caused by _Rickettsia conorii_ and presents with high fever, head and muscle aches and rash. In 2005, several strains of _R. conorii_ were proposed to be subspecies of the organism based on differences detected by serological and genetic means. The typical MSF organism is now referred to as _R. conorii_ subsp. _conorii_ and the agents of Indian tick typhus, Astrakhan fever and Israeli spotted fever (ISF) referred to as subspecies _indica_, _caspia_ and _israelensis_, respectively (1).

The ISF organism was 1st isolated in Israel in 1974 and, although initially thought to have a restricted area of distribution, it has been found in Portugal, Sicily, and parts of northern Africa including Tunisia. The organism is usually associated with the dog as the underlying reservoir and with _Rhipicephalus sanguinus_ as the tick vector. Since fatal infections are generally linked to late diagnoses (2), the disease should be quickly suspected and treated (like Rocky Mountain spotted fever in the USA) based on clinical signs and symptoms. After an incubation period 0f 6-7 days following tick exposure, the disease presents with headache, myalgias, high fever and a diffuse rash that can affect the palms and soles. A hallmark of MSF is an eschar at the tick bite site called tache noir is often absent in ISF.

The disease is endemic in Israel with an incidence varying from 0.7 to 10.3/100 000 from 1971-1980 (2) and has decreased since then. According to the weekly reports of the Epidemiology department in the Ministry of Health, Jerusalem, the total number of "spotted fever" cases, recorded during 2011 was 13 compared to 15 during 2010 (http://www.old.health.gov.il/pages/images/excel.gif). The annual incidence is generally highest in children less than 10 years of age and lowest in those over 65 years old. A strong seasonal pattern exists with most cases occurring between June and October.
