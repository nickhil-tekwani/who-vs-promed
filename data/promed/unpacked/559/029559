Antibody to influenza A H5N1 virus was found in nine blood samples out of
502 tested in relation to the first avian flu case detected in Hong Kong.
The antibody to the virus was detected mainly among poultry workers and
people directly exposed to the virus. The results, based on studies
related to the first avian flu case in a human, suggested that the main
mode of H5N1 transmission was from bird-to-human. Analysis of the viral
genes shows that they are avian in nature without evidence of re-assortment
with human influenza virus genes. The results leave open the possibility
of person-to-person transmission. However, the absence of antibody among
the family members of the ill child and the overall low number of antibody
positive people in contact with the child suggested that such transmission,
if occurring, is relatively inefficient at this time.
These preliminary results and findings were released today (Saturday)
jointly by the Hong Kong Department of Health, WHO and the Centers for
Disease Control (CDC) and Prevention in Atlanta, USA. They stressed that
the observations were preliminary and were based on serological test
results done in connection with the first patient, using a
microneutralization assay developed at CDC. Additional findings are
expected by late January next year when test results of other cases become
available and other studies currently being conducted are completed.
The nine persons tested positive of antibody were all from the 502 people
in the "exposed group", made up of poultry workers, people in contact with
the boy and people working with the virus, such as laboratory workers. In
contrast, another 419 people in a "comparison group" who had no history of
contact with the ill child were all negative for influenza A H5N1 antibody.
These results suggested that poultry workers and people known to have had
direct contact with the virus were more likely to have antibody to this
virus.
The nine antibody positive persons out of the 502 tested 1.8% were from the
following groups:
People potentially in contact with the child:
0 of 4 family members
1 of 54 health care workers (1.9%)
1 of 261 staff, students and their parents (0.4%)
People in the same district:
1 of 63 (1.6%)
Laboratory workers:
1 of 73 (1.4%)
People exposed to poultry or pigs:
5 of 29 poultry workers (17.2%)
0 of 18 pig farm workers or neighbours
Follow up investigation of the nine antibody positive persons indicated
that five were poultry workers, one was a student with exposure to poultry,
one was a laboratory worker and one was a person whose exposure history was
not clear. The remaining antibody positive person was a healthcare worker
who helped take care of the child. The healthcare worker gave no history of
exposure to poultry raising the possibility of human-to-human transmission.
These data are consistent with the possibility that influenza A H5N1 virus
might be transmitted to humans by:

exposure to infected poultry
direct exposure to virus
exposure to someone who is ill and infectious
"The Hong Kong Government has already initiated measures to help make sure
that chicken sold in the market are free of avian flu," the Director of
Health, Dr Margaret Chan said. "With the co-operation of the mainland
authority, export of chickens from the mainland to Hong Kong has been
temporarily suspended. [This will allow time to put in place a system in
the mainland to ensure the health status of chickens exported to Hong Kong,
and a system here to conduct rapid tests on chicken imported again in the
future." "So far, surveillance of local farms has not detected any
chickens that are positive for influenza A H5N1. The situation will be
closely monitored by the Agriculture and Fisheries Department." "At the
wholesale and retail levels, blitz cleaning of chicken stalls has been
started and will continue over the next few days to improve the hygiene
conditions of these places." "All these public health measures are taken
to ensure that chicken sold in Hong Kong are healthy and to rebuild
consumers' confidence."
CDPC Note: The virus did not escape from the laboratory, but apparently the
results leaked out [to the Hong Kong web site before Dr. Chan's news
conference!
