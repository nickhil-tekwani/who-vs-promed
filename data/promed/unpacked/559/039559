Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comment: As part of routine, pre-slaughter testing and surveillance for H5/H7 avian influenza, H7N1 low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) was detected in a commercial broiler breeder flock based upon H7 PCR and antibody to H7 and N1. Partial HA sequencing determined the H7 to be a low pathogenic virus of North American wild bird lineage. Further characterization is pending virus recovery. The flock exhibited a slight increase in mortality and a decrease in egg production. Depopulation of the premises is underway. The USDA Animal Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) and the Texas Animal Health Commission are conducting a comprehensive epidemiological investigation of this incident and have implemented enhanced surveillance and testing within 10 km of this finding.

Control measures
Measures applied: movement control inside the country; surveillance outside containment and/or protection zone; surveillance within containment and/or protection zone; stamping out; quarantine; zoning; vaccination prohibited; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: Disinfection

Diagnostic test results:

[This is the 2nd finding of a low pathogenic avian influenza virus subtype H7N1. The active surveillance program in the United States shows its effectiveness in detecting AI virus and the importance of such early detection to allow proper preventive and response measures to be implemented. - Mod.CRD
