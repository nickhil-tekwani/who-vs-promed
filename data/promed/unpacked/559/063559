Japan reported in 2017 over 5000 syphilis patients for the 1st time since comparable data became available in 1999, with the number rising particularly among women in their 20s, data by a national research center showed on Friday [5 Jan 2018].

With Tokyo accounting for roughly 30 per cent of the reported patients, the metropolitan government is set to start providing more free syphilis tests from April 2018 to contain the disease, which is curable at an early stage but has serious consequences if left untreated.

As of 17 Dec 2017, the total number of syphilis patients in Japan stood at 5534, up from 4518 in 2016, according to the National Institute of Infectious Diseases. The cause behind the increase in the number of people contracting the sexually transmitted disease remains unclear.

By area, Tokyo reported the largest number at 1705, followed by Osaka Prefecture at 788, Aichi Prefecture at 325, and Kanagawa Prefecture at 312.

To prevent further spread of the disease ahead of the Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games in 2020, the Tokyo metropolitan government has earmarked funds in its fiscal 2018 budget to conduct more free and anonymous tests and train doctors who have limited experience in treating syphilis.

Syphilis is caused by bacteria called _Treponema pallidum_. In the primary stage, the disease presents as only minor tumors [ulcers] in affected areas, such as the genital area and lips, and can be cured by antibacterial drugs. But if left untreated, the infection can eventually cause inflammation throughout the body as well as brain and heart complications as it progresses.

Pregnant women who contracted the disease before or during pregnancy can pass it to their baby, and the disease, known as congenital syphilis, can cause stillbirth or symptoms affecting infants such as meningitis and skin rashes.

[The United States has experienced a similar rising incidence of syphilis since 2000 (https://www.cdc.gov/std/stats15/syphilis.htm). In 2000, primary and secondary (P&S) syphilis reached historic lows with less than 6000 reported cases and an incidence of only 2.1 cases per 100 000 people. However, in 2015, 23 872 P&S syphilis cases were reported with an incidence of 7.5 cases per 100 000 population, the highest rate reported since 1994. Syphilis rates increased in every region of the US, a majority of age groups, and across almost every race/ethnicity.

During 2000-2015, the rise in the rate of reported P&S syphilis in the US was primarily attributable to increased cases among men and, specifically, among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM). In more recent years (2013-15), syphilis also increased among women, which was associated with increasing rates of congenital syphilis. During 2014-2015, the rate increased 18.1 per cent among men and 27.3 per cent among women. - Mod.ML
