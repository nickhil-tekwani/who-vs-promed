Zhongpin pork processor's net income rises
------------------------------------------
Chinese pork processing company Zhongpin Inc. said on Friday [7 May 2010]
that its net income had risen 37 per cent in the 1st quarter as its sales
rose. For the 3 months that ended 31 Mar 2010, the company earned USD 13.3
million, or 38 cents per share, compared with USD 9.7 million, or 33 cents
per share, in the 1st quarter of 2009.

Zhongpin noted that hog and pork prices fell about 10 per cent in the 1st
quarter from the previous quarter because of an outbreak of foot and mouth
disease in south China.

[The reported rise in sales of processed pork, combined with falling hog
and pork prices "because of FMD outbreak in south China", falls in line
with the following, earlier information, translated from local Chinese sources:

1. Posting 20100318.0866: "Since there have recently been severe outbreaks
of FMD in Jilin, Heilongjiang, Liaoning, and Inner Mongolia" (provinces
from where no official disease notification is available as yet; for the
list of infected provinces, see further), "there has been an impact on
development of the livestock industry."

2. Posting 20100322.0912: "hog disease in the south is still striking blows
on local hog markets and affecting feed suppliers."

3. Posting 20100411.1174, item 2: "Since mortality from this disease is not
high, a large number of hogs are sent for slaughter, and the short-term
expansion of supply puts downward pressure on hog prices (information from
the Ministry of Commerce price forecasting and alert system shows that the
total number of hogs sent for slaughter among 1000 pig producers in January
2010 was 14.56 percent higher than December 2009. Looking regionally, in
the key production areas of Hunan, Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Henan, the volume
of hogs sent for slaughter increased 42.47, 32.45, 22.74, and 17.51 per
cent, respectively).

"Also, the price of piglets fell to 15.83 yuan [USD 2.32]/kg; stocks are
remaining lower among most breeders due to their worry over potential
outbreaks and losses."

Has non-heat-treated pork export from China increased since the beginning
of 2010? Any changes in destinations? Which are the main current export
markets? Information would be much appreciated.

7 provinces in China have been officially reported as infected by FMDV
serotype O since Feb 2010: Guangdong (outbreaks starting on 22 Feb, 4 Mar);
Gansu (14 Mar, 7 Apr, 17 Apr); Shanxi (25 Mar); Jianqxi (28 Mar); Guizhou
(13 Apr); Xinjiang (20 Apr) and Ningxia (23 Apr).

In ProMED-mail posting 20100504.1445, we cited information on a person who
was, allegedly, arrested for "inciting panic" through the internet on FMD
in pigs "in the Hanzhong area, which is a part of Shanxi". This should have
read "Shaanxi" (a province neighbouring Shanxi on its west). We are
indebted to Dan Silver for this correction. - Mod.AS]
