[Prof. Hal Nash became interested in the possible links between
infection & chronic disease, partly through reading ProMED-mail.
We commissioned him to provide a summary of the current state of
knowledge, which will be posted in several parts, all with titles
beginning:
"Chronic disease"
- Jack Woodall, Director, ProMED-mail

Escherichia coli and colorectal cancer
--------------------------------------------
Certain studies provide evidence that some colorectal cancers are the
result of infectious agents. One group found that bacterial
methyltransferases induced mutations in tumor suppressor genes.
Another group focused on the presence and absence of certain
intestinal bacteria concluding the possibility that some microflora
might serve as promoters while others might serve as anti-promoters
of colorectal carcinogenesis. Finally, a third group concentrated
their studies on colicins, which are antibiotically active substance,
some of which have been found to exert antitumor effects. This group
found that the absence of colicinogenic _E. coli_ might be a
contributing factor in the development of colorectal carcinoma.
Further implication of _E. coli_ in colorectal cancer was found when
researchers concluded that in their sample, the patients with
colorectal cancer had mucosal, intracellular invasion by _E. coli_
while those with no colorectal cancer had no such mucosal invasion.

Human papilloma virus and anal cancer
-----------------------------------------------
In a report about a year old, researchers made a strong connection
between human papilloma virus and the development of anal cancer.
The viral DNA was detected via PCR in 84% of anal cancer tissues,
while none of the rectal adenocarcinomas [control group were
positive for the viral nucleic acid. Sexual transmission, high
numbers of sex partners, and male homosexuality [strongly correlated
with high numbers of sex partners - Mod.JW were all associated in
increased risk of development of this disease.

Mycobacterium paratuberculosis and Crohn's/Johne's Disease
--------------------------------------------------------------------
In the few respondents regarding Crohn's Disease, the consensus was
that there was no consensus. One respondent was so confident that
the link between _Mycobacterium paratuberculosis_ and Crohn's Disease
was so clear that it warranted an end of discussion comment. Another
respondent indicated that there was an obvious connection but one
which needed heavy funding to finally hammer out the details of the
organism's involvement in the disease. A third respondent confessed
that the organism plays a role in the disease but that its role is,
as understood now, tenuous at best.
Such comments, from people who should know, illustrate the
insidiousness and ambiguity that chronic infectious agents display in
causing human pathology. I make this comment not toward the
researchers, but rather to the organisms for the subtleties they are
capable of displaying. Mycobacterial species are well known for
their cell wall structure and composition. But interestingly, _M.
paratuberculosis_ both with and without cell walls (in other words,
as spheroplasts) has been isolated from CD patients. This immediately
highlights the need for other detection methods.
Genetic probes, epidemiologic evidence, and antimicrobial therapeutic
evidence exist for implicating _M. paratuberculosis_ as an etiologic
agent in CD. Most of the evidence contains at least some conflicting
data, yet the supporting evidence is strong enough to suggest _M.
paratuberculosis_ is a significant complicating factor in CD.
Johne's Disease is a chronic intestinal disease of ruminant animals
resulting in wasting and diarrhea. _M. paratuberculosis_ appears to
have been clearly implicated in this animal disease. A goat was
infected with the organism taken from a human patient with Crohn's
Disease and showed progression to Johne's Disease.
In the United Kingdom, enough evidence for a causal relationship
between the organism and CD exists for the Government to conduct
health tests on milk after it was shown that _M. paratuberculosis_
was surviving pasteurization.
