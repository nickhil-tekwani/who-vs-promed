Dengue fever has become a grave threat for people in Bantul regency,
Yogyakarta, with the number of people contracting the dengue virus
last month [Dec 2005] reaching 61 people, a 300 percent increase
compared to [Nov 2005]. The number is expected to increase in coming
months [as of Jan 2006] as rain has started to pound the region, said
health officer with Bantul regency administration Gandung Bambang Hermanto.
"While in October and November [2005] only 22 and 20 people were
infected with the dengue virus, respectively, in December the number
rose to 61 people," said Gandung, the chief of surveillance section
with Bantul health office.
Besides the rainy season, bad sanitation was also blamed for the
rising number of people contracting the disease, said Gandung. "We
regret that the area free of [_Aedes aegypti_] mosquito larvae in the
regency is only 67 percent of the total area, while in order to be
free of dengue the area free of mosquito larvae should reach 95
percent," said Gandung.
The rainy season has provided ample opportunity for the mosquito to
breed. The rain has created puddles in many areas, making ideal
breeding grounds for [_Aedes aegypti_] mosquitoes, the carrier of
dengue fever, said Gandung.
In order to prevent the spread of the disease, the government has
intensified its campaign by calling on the public to clean up the
environment. The government also distributed larvicidal powder in
order to help destroy mosquito larvae.
"A mosquito can produce 400 larvae in a single go. Can you imagine
how many larvae would persist in a puddle if we do not clean this
up?" said Gandung.
With the additional 61 persons, the number of people contracting
dengue virus in Bantul totaled 195 in 2005. 4 of these people died,
according to Gandung.
Bantul is a regency next to ancient city of Yogyakarta, which has for
years been a popular destination for tourists, both foreign and domestic.

Health Services in the Mexican state of Oaxaca registered in [2005]
1076 cases of dengue fever; 910 were classic dengue fever and 166
were hemorrhagic dengue fever [DHF]. However, no deaths were reported.
In spite of heavy rainfalls and severe damage caused by hurricanes,
particularly Stan, authorities affirmed that no pandemics of the
disease occurred, since people responded to prevention campaigns
launched this year [2005].
They explained that until the 51st Epidemiological Week [of 2005],
Oaxaca Health Services had 1076 cases of dengue fever registered; 536
occurred in Tehuantepec isthmus, where 441 cases of classic dengue
and 93 cases of hemorrhagic dengue fever were recorded.
They added that even though meteorological phenomena such as
hurricane Stan severely affected the area, this did not lead to a
huge increase in the number of cases of dengue fever, as was the case
in Veracruz. On the contrary, they said, the case toll remained stable.
Authorities explained that community participation in the fight
against the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito vector, through cleaning their
households' backyards and roofs, was fruitful, since no deaths cause
by dengue had been recorded.
In order to fight the insect, they reported that in August 2005, 5
million Pesos [USD 472 144] were allocated for purchasing materials,
and during the contingency provoked by Hurricane Stan, healthcare
worker teams were sent to [the] affected areas, such as Tuxtepec,
Istmo, and Costa.
Antivectorial control has been expanded to 489 communities in 166
municipalities, and 31 209 hectares of land and 411 868 households
had been treated.
Health authorities pointed out that, even though temperatures have
recently fallen, Health Services are in a permanent state of alert.
According to official figures, of the 1076 cases of dengue fever
recorded in Oaxaca during 2005, 536 were found in the Tehuantepec
Isthmus, followed by Tuxtepec with 263 cases, 233 of which correspond
to classic dengue fever and 30 to the hemorrhagic form [DHF] of the disease.
The coastal region had 136 dengue fever cases; 107 were classic
dengue fever and 29 DHF. Central valleys had 78 cases (69 and 9,
respectively); Mixteca, 40 cases (36 and 4), and the highlands
reported 23 cases of dengue fever (22 and 1, respectively).
