=95Cholera - Somalia:=20
A total of 4437 cholera cases with 146 deaths have been reported since
the end of November 1996 to 7 May 1997. The real number of cases
is believed to be higher because of the difficulty of data collection.
Weekly reports have been made by NGOs working in the country as well as
by the local authorities where available. A total of over 2000 cases
with 74 deaths has been recorded in the epidemic in Mogadishu, but it
appears that it has now passed its peak, although high levels are still
being reported. Intensified efforts are still necessary to guarantee
sufficient supplies to all NGOs involved and continued vigilance is
needed, especially in those areas not yet affected by this epidemic. WHO
is supporting the NGO's and local authorities by providing technical
support and supplies.=20
