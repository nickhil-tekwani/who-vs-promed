The number of new syphilis patients in Japan has surpassed 2000 in 2015, statistics showed, raising concerns at the health ministry about the continuing spread of the sexually transmitted disease.

As of Oct. 28, 2037 new cases -- 1463 males and 574 females -- had been reported, according to the National Institute of Infectious Diseases.

It is the 1st time the number has reached 2000 since the Infectious Disease Control Law in 1999 required medical institutions to report syphilis cases to authorities.

The rapid increase in the number of infected younger women is especially worrisome. Their number rose almost 5-fold from 124 in 2010. 76 percent of the new female patients this year were between the ages of 15 and 35.

The ministry is trying to raise awareness that contracting syphilis during pregnancy could lead to stillbirths and birth defects.

Syphilis is transmitted mainly through sexual contact. Symptoms include lumps and cankers spreading around the genitals. The disease can be treated with antibiotics. But if it is left untreated, the body can become covered by a rash and [the disease can] lead to death.

The health ministry recommends proper use of condoms and avoiding having sexual contact with random, multiple partners.

The number of reported syphilis cases peaked at about 11 000 in 1967, and hovered around 500 between 2001 and 2005. But the figure has increased in recent years.

[We recently posted a report on the increasing incidence of syphilis in Japan (Syphilis - Japan: increased incidence 20151201.3830672). That news report, like the current report, was concerned about the rapid increase in the incidence of syphilis among women in Japan. In that prior report, I mistakenly interpreted the total number of cases in women between 1 Jan and 28 Oct 2015 to be 177, when in fact that number is the number of cases in women in the age group 20-24 years of age. The total number of cases in women between 1 Jan and 28 Oct 2015 given in the news report above and elsewhere (http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2015/11/24/national/science-health/syphilis-cases-rise-sharply-japan-especially-among-women/#.Vn83o17Ws08), is 574, over 4.6-fold higher than the 124 cases reported in 2010, whereas the total number of cases in men is 1463, 2.9-fold higher than the 497 cases reported in 2010.

Nevertheless, ProMED-mail reported in 2014 that the number of cases of syphilis, presumably primary and secondary syphilis, in Japan increased yearly since 2010 (from 621 in 2010 to reach more than 1000 cases in 2013, to 1617 in 2014 and now 2037 so far this year). In 2013, of the more than 1000 cases, 989 were men, with the majority being between the ages of 25 and 39 years. The 2014 news report said that the Tokyo branch of the National Institute of Infectious Diseases speculated that this increase was due to "sexual contact between males." This presumed increase in syphilis in Japan due to men who have sex with men (MSM) is similar to the situation in the US and many other countries, as reported in other ProMED-mail posts listed below. This year (2015), 72 percent of cases of syphilis are said to be occurring in men (1463 males of a total of 2037 cases); most likely many are in MSM. - Mod.ML
