Thai pigs declared free from avian flu
---------------------------------------
The Ministry of Agriculture confirmed today [15 May 2005] that no cases of
avian flu had been found among Thai pigs, pointing to strict measures to
ensure that the virus did not spread from poultry to other animals.
Speaking in response to the discovery of the H5N1 virus among pigs in
Indonesia, Dr. Charan Trunwuttiphong, vice minister for agriculture and
agricultural cooperatives, stressed that Thailand had been carefully
monitoring for signs of the disease in pigs but had not found any instances
of the virus.
Under Ministry of Agriculture rules drawn up during the height of the bird
flu crisis, farmers are told not to raise chickens and pigs together and to
inform district livestock officers immediately if they discover any animal
dying of unknown causes.
The Indonesian discovery is particularly worrying given the genetic
similarities between pigs and humans and the fact that pigs are often
responsible for the spread of the human influenza virus. Scientists are
concerned that the spread of avian flu to pigs could lead to the emergence
of a new and potentially fatal strain of human flu.
While other countries in the region are still struggling to control the
avian flu virus, Thailand could be declared officially free of the disease
within a matter of weeks. However, the government is insisting that careful
monitoring for the disease, which is notoriously hard to eradicate, will
continue.
Next month [June 2005], agriculture and public health officials will hold a
joint meeting in the northern province of Chiang Mai to exchange
information and views on how to control the disease and prevent its spread
to both animals and humans.

[The statement that "Thailand had been carefully monitoring for signs of
the disease in pigs but had not found any instances of the virus" is in
need of solid proof. In Indonesia, the virus was allegedly isolated from
symptomless pigs kept 100 yards from infected poultry premises. Data on
number, locations and testing methods in sampled Thai pigs, if available,
should be studied in order to scientifically evaluate the presence or,
hopefully, the absence of infection in pigs.
In relation to Thailand regaining the status of a country free from Highly
Pathogenic Avian Influenza: in the past, at least 6 months were needed for
that action, according to OIE's Terrestrial Animal Health Code. However,
this could become 3 months in the near future. The change depends upon the
approval of the suggested revision of Article 2.7.12.7., "NAI free country,
zone or compartment" of the Code. The changes will be discussed during the
due General Session, 22-27 May 2005, in Paris. The new text
<http://www.oie.int/tahsc/eng/Reports/A_SCCDAJAN2005.pdf>
says:
"If (HPNAI=highly pathogenic notifiable avian influenza) infection has
occurred in a previously free country, zone or compartment, free status can
be regained... 3 months after a stamping out policy (including disinfection
of all affected establishments) is applied, providing that surveillance (in
accordance with a detailed appendix) has been carried out during that
3-month period." - Mod.AS]
