Illinois Company recalls ground beef
--------------
J&B Meats Company is recalling about 65 000 pounds of ground beef that may
be contaminated with _E. coli_ bacteria. 3 people became ill after eating
catered hamburgers made from meat earlier this month in eastern Iowa, said
Kevin Teale, spokesman for the Iowa Department of Public Health.
The meat was packaged 13 May 2002 and distributed to hotels, restaurants,
and institutions nationwide. None was sold in grocery stores. Each case
has a 7-digit code ending in 213052 and the code EST.9156S inside the USDA
seal of inspection.
_E. coli_ O157 can cause serious illness and sometimes death. Symptoms
include chills and bloody diarrhea. [Fever may be absent in this enteric
infection. In severe infections, particularly in children, hemolytic uremic
syndrome may occur. Most authorities agree that antimicrobial therapy is to
be avoided, as it as associated with increased
complications. - Mod.LL]
Consumers with questions about the recall may contact the company at (800)
522-7345.

[ProMED-mail had recently received a report of 1 or 2 cases of documented
_E. coli_ O157:H7 infection in employees of a health care facility in
eastern Iowa, which were said to have been acquired from hamburger eaten at
a hospital gathering. This report of possible contamination of ground beef
by _E. coli_ O157 with multistate distribution may have been the source of
these cases, and additional cases may yet be found. - Mod.LL]
