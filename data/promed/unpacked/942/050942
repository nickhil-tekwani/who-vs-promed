Avian flu halts some Minnesota poultry exports, says USDA
---------------------------------------------------------
Hong Kong, Cuba, Guatemala, Singapore, and Taiwan have halted poultry
exports from Wright County, Minnesota, after cases of low-pathogenic
bird flu were discovered, according to the United States Department of
Agriculture (USDA).

"Countries have banned imports of poultry from Minnesota because
low-pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) cases were confirmed in the
state," Workabeba Yigzaw, a spokeswoman for the USDA's Animal and
Plant Health Inspection Service, said today in an email.

Hong Kong stopped imports of poultry meat and products derived from
birds raised or processed in Wright Country on or after 4 Jul 2011,
according to the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service. Cuba and
Guatemala stopped all shipments of raw poultry and poultry meat
products in that county from birds slaughtered on or after 29 Jun
2011, the agency said.

Singapore stopped imports of fresh or frozen poultry meat from birds
raised and processed in Wright County, Minnesota, on or after 4 Jul
2011, the USDA said. Taiwan halted imports of all poultry meat and
products loaded-on-board vessel on or after 29 Jun 2011, the agency
said.

[Poultry is a very large and important industry in many countries.
The risk, however small, of even low pathogenic avian influenza is
more than some countries wish. Furthermore, mutations can occur and
those low pathogenic strains can become high pathogenic strains. While
is not necessarily common, it has on occasion occurred.

Likely the facility is quarantined. - Mod.TG
