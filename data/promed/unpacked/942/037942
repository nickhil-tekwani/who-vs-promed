Fishermen have been banned from trawling parts of the Ayrshire coast. An outbreak of marine algae has locked down large swathes of the water off Troon and Prestwick [South Ayrshire].

And even humans are being warned to steer clear in a bid to stop the poison from spreading.

If anyone eats affected shellfish, symptoms can begin attacking the nervous system within minutes. Tingling lips, tongues, fingers and toes, a loss of control of arms and legs, and difficulty swallowing or breathing are all signs of the poison in humans.

Environmental chiefs have moved to lock down the waters to commercial shellfish trawlers.

Two classified harvesting areas at Barassie's North Bay and Meikle Craigs in Prestwick are the worst affected.

And South Ayrshire Council this week [week of 11 May 2015] confirmed they are dealing with "high levels of marine algae in the seawater."

A spokesman said: "Members of the public are strongly advised not to gather shellfish from Barassie shore or Prestwick shore for their personal consumption due to the serious potential health risk.

"Warning signs have been posted along the affected coastline while the closure remains in place.

"The Veterinary Poisons Information Service have advised that as a precaution any dog entering the sea in affected areas should be hosed down afterwards and also not to allow dogs to consume shellfish from affected areas."

A spokesman for Troon Fishermen's Mission said: "Fortunately the fleet that operates out of Troon does not fish in the Barassie North Bay or Meikle Craigs.

"And the warning is clear to any other trawlers thinking of coming into the area."

[The clinical signs here fit paralytic shellfish poisoning, also known as red tide poisoning. This has been reported previously off the coast of Scotland in 2013 (see ProMED-mail post 20130701.1800637).

Paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) is a significant problem in many areas. Caused by several closely related species in the genus _Alexandrium_, PSP toxins are responsible for persistent problems due to their accumulation in filter feeding shellfish, but they also move through the food chain, affecting zooplankton, fish larvae, adult fish, and even birds and marine mammals.

It is likely that seasonally recurring outbreaks of PSP are linked to the existence of a dormant cyst stage in the _Alexandrium_ life history. This strategy allows the species to deposit dormant cells in sediments where they survive through harsh winter conditions and then germinate to initiate new outbreaks in subsequent years. Long-term climatic variability, which affects temperature, upwelling, and currents or allows cysts to survive in areas where they did not before, may be factors in extensions.

Shellfish that have caused this disease include mussels, cockles, clams, scallops, oysters, crabs, and lobsters. Symptoms begin anywhere from 15 minutes to 10 hours after eating the contaminated shellfish, although usually within 2 hours. Symptoms are generally mild, and begin with numbness or tingling of the face, arms, and legs. This is followed by headache, dizziness, nausea, and muscular incoordination. Patients sometimes describe a floating sensation. In cases of severe poisoning, muscle paralysis, and respiratory failure occur, and in these cases death may occur in 2 to 25 hours.
