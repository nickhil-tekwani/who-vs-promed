Influenza update no. 236 [based on data up to 19 Apr 2015]
----------------------------------------------------------
Summary
-------
Influenza activity declined further in the northern hemisphere with mainly influenza B virus
circulation and was low in most regions globally.

- In North America, influenza activity continued to decrease and was close to inter-seasonal levels with influenza B virus predominant in the last weeks.
- In Europe, influenza activity continued to decline in most countries. Influenza B virus remained predominant in recent weeks.
- In northern Africa, influenza activity decreased almost to inter-seasonal levels.
- In western Asia, a decrease in influenza activity mainly associated with A(H1N1)pdm09 virus was observed in the last weeks.
- In the temperate countries of Asia, influenza activity of mainly influenza B virus was further declining.
- In tropical countries of the Americas, influenza activity remained low in most countries.
- In tropical Asia, influenza activity and influenza-like illness (ILI) activity continued to decrease in southern Asia, where influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus predominated. Influenza activity has continued to decrease from its peak in southern China including Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China. In the southern hemisphere, influenza activity remained at inter-seasonal levels.
- Based on FluNet reporting (as of 30 Apr 2015 12:00 UTC), National Influenza Centres (NICs) and other national influenza laboratories from 89 countries, areas or territories reported data for the time period from 5 Apr 2015 to 18 Apr 2015. The WHO GISRS [Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System] laboratories tested more than 65 361 specimens. 8249 were positive for influenza viruses, of which 2566 (31.1 percent) were typed as influenza A and 5683 (68.9 percent) as influenza B. Of the sub-typed influenza A viruses, 670 (37.6 percent) were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and 1114 (62.4 percent) were influenza A(H3N2). Of the characterized B viruses, 1127 (95.0 percent) belonged to the B-Yamagata lineage and 59 (5.0 percent) to the B-Victoria lineage.

Countries in the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere
----------------------------------------------------------
North America
In North America, influenza activity continued to decrease overall with influenza B virus predominating in recent weeks. In Canada, influenza continued to decline overall. However, some elevated activity was still reported in the Central and Atlantic provinces and widespread activity was reported in 2 regions in Quebec.

In the United States of America, influenza activity continued to decrease. Only 3 states in the north-east region of the country reported continuing widespread activity. Nationwide, the proportion of deaths attributed to pneumonia and influenza was below the epidemic threshold and the proportion of outpatient visits due to influenza-like illness (ILI) was below the national baseline. The percentage of samples testing positive declined to 7.6 percent and the majority of these positive samples were influenza B.

In Mexico, both influenza A and influenza B virus detections continued to decrease. Acute respiratory infection (ARI) activity (299 ARI cases by 100 000 habitants) also continued to decrease as compared to the last report (397 ARI cases by 100 000 habitants) and the peak (700 ARI cases per 100 000) at the end of January [2015]. Pneumonia activity continued to decrease but remained elevated.

Europe
In Europe, influenza activity continued to decrease in most reporting countries with influenza B virus predominating in recent weeks. The proportion of influenza positive samples was 25 percent, a decrease since the last report (36 percent), but remained above the seasonal threshold (10 percent). Most activity was reported in northern and eastern Europe. Influenza B virus accounted for 75 percent of the influenza detections from sentinel surveillance site.

Northern Africa and Middle East
In northern Africa and the Middle East, influenza activity continued to decrease throughout most of the region.

Western Asia
In western Asia, influenza activity continued to decrease in most countries in the region. Most countries reported little to no influenza activity, with the exception of Turkey and Jordan; both countries reported decreasing but still high numbers of influenza detections, mainly influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 in Jordan and a mixture of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and B virus in Turkey.

Central Asia
In central Asia, some countries reported low influenza activity with few influenza B virus detections.

Eastern Asia
In eastern Asia, influenza activity continued to decrease in most of the region. Influenza A(H3N2) was predominant during most of the season followed by influenza B later in the season. Northern China reported decreased influenza activity with influenza B accounting for 97 percent of the influenza positive specimens. The Republic of Korea reported a decrease in influenza activity from its peak and bin recent weeks reported a predominance of influenza B virus.

Countries in the tropical zone
------------------------------
Tropical countries of the Americas/Central America and the Caribbean
Overall, influenza activity in the Caribbean, Central America and the tropical countries of South America remained low, with influenza A(H3N2) and influenza B predominant in countries with activity. Colombia, Ecuador, El Salvador, and Peru reported RSV [respiratory syncytial virus] activity. Cuba reported an increase in SARI [severe acute respiratory infection] cases in the most recent week but among respiratory samples tested, only 6 percent were due to influenza.

Central African tropical region
In Africa, increased activity was reported from West Africa. Ghana reported increased influenza activity with influenza A(H3N2) and A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses predominating. Cote d'Ivoire reported some influenza A(H3N2) and A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses co-circulating in recent weeks. Few influenza detections were reported from the Democratic Republic of Congo. Decreasing influenza detections were reported from Eastern Africa.

Tropical Asia
In tropical Asia, influenza activity continued to decrease throughout the region. Influenza A and influenza B virus co-circulated in some countries throughout the region. Bhutan, India, Nepal, and Sri Lanka all reported decreased influenza activity with a predominance in influenza A(H1N1)pdm09.

South China and Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China also reported an overall decrease in influenza activity with influenza A(H3N2) and influenza B co-circulating.

Countries in the temperate zone of the southern hemisphere
----------------------------------------------------------
Influenza activity remained at inter-seasonal levels in most of the reporting countries in the southern hemisphere.

Source of data
--------------
The Global Influenza Programme monitors influenza activity worldwide and publishes an update every 2 weeks. The updates are based on available epidemiological and virological data sources, including FluNet (reported by the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System), FluID (epidemiological data reported by national focal points), and influenza reports from WHO Regional Offices and Member States. Completeness can vary among updates due to availability and quality of data available at the time when the update is developed.
