2000 IAI workers out with flu-like symptoms
--------------------------------------------
2000 workers of the Israel Aircraft Industries plant in Lod stayed home on
Thu, 3 Jul 2002 -- and it wasn't industrial action. There were 60 absentees
on Wed, 2 Jul 2003.
All the missing workers told their bosses they had stomach aches and high
fever. The Ramle District Health Office sent inspectors to take samples of
cafeteria food and water from the plant in order to identify the source of
the illness. Results will be available soon. The inspectors ruled out the
possibility of environmental pollutants causing the illness. According to
the Health Ministry, none of the workers has been hospitalized.

Foodborne streptococcal outbreak in an Israeli industrial plant
---------------------------------------------------
According to the website of Israel Broadcasting authority, the cafeteria at
the Aviation Industries plant was closed for investigation after about 2000
employees became ill as a consequence of a streptococcus contamination.
No details are available on the species involved or the signs and symptoms
found.

[ProMED would appreciate more information regarding this apparent
food-related illness in Israel. The report from the Jerusalem Post
suggests a point source illness with fever and abdominal pain. The second
report from the same day reported by Dr. Affrias suggests that the illness
was related to streptococci. Indeed, streptococci can be associated with
foodborne illness, particularly Group A streptococcus, _S.
pyogenes_. However, the illness is usually not related to abdominal pain
but rather -- as this citation, also from Israel, points out -- epidemic
pharyngitis:
Lossos IS, Felsenstein, Breuer R, Engelhard D: Food-borne outbreak of group
A beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis. Arch Intern Med 1992;152:853-5.
Abstact:
An outbreak of pharyngitis due to group A beta-hemolytic streptococci type
T 12 occurred at a military base. An epidemiologic investigation indicated
that the outbreak was food borne. Consumption of boiled egg salad at lunch
was significantly associated with the illness. Immediate institution of
antibiotic therapy and isolation of the patients prevented secondary
respiratory spread of the infection. No cases of poststreptococcal
suppurative and nonsuppurative complications were found during a 6-week
period after the outbreak. Medical personnel should be aware of the
possibility of food-borne streptococcal pharyngitis. Regular health
surveillance of food handlers and food preparation processes are important
for prevention of such outbreaks.
