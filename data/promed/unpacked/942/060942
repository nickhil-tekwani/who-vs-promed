After long weeks of waiting, the yellow fever [YF] vaccine finally
arrived in the country with 5 districts -- Abim, Agago, Pader,
Kitgum, and Lamwo -- set to receive the drug first. One million doses
arrived on Wednesday [12 Jan 2011] and if all goes as planned,
vaccination is to start on 22 Jan [2011] targeting all people above 6
months. The amount of drugs received is, however, less than the 2.5
million doses that the ministry had earlier said it needed to carry
out a mass vaccination in 26 districts in northern Uganda.

While addressing the press in Kampala yesterday [13 Jan 2011], the
assistant commissioner National Disease Control Dr Issa Makumbi, said
the country will only require more drugs if the disease is confirmed
in the remaining 5 districts that were feared to have the disease.
These are Gulu, Arua, Kaabong, Kotido, and Lira. "We are still
carrying out tests in the other districts. Once the laboratory tests
confirm yellow fever, we shall mobilise for more drugs," Dr Makumbi
said. He said if there is need for more vaccination, the surrounding
districts to the 5 will be the next in line.

The vaccination exercise is budgeted to cost USD 3.5 million; yet to
be released to the ministry. Junior health minister Richard Nduhura
said the public should be calm and follow advice to avoid contracting
the disease.

[This report does not mention the occurrence of new cases. A report
on 10 Jan 2011 indicated that close to 50 people died from YF virus
infections with another 190 infected in the previous 2 weeks (see
ProMED-mail archive no 20110111.0123), indicating that active
transmission of YF virus was ongoing at that time. The arrival of the
YF vaccine is good news, although less than earlier vaccine needs
estimates indicated. One hopes that intensive YF surveillance in all
10 districts will be carried out, with rapid response by the
vaccination teams if and when new cases are detected.
