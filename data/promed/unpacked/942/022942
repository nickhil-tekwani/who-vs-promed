[This is the 2nd part of the daily update following the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, with a focus on selected countries of interest.

To reduce the size of these posts, there will be changes over the coming days. The tables will be reduced but are available at the source URLs and will be referred to in the summaries of daily changes for each country. Countries that have almost interrupted transmission and have been lifting restrictions (China, South Korea) and have lessons to learn as they attempt to prevent explosive 2nd waves will continue to be profiled. We will attempt to select countries from each region on a daily basis. - Mod.MPP]

[According to the report above, in the past 24 hours there have been 16 newly confirmed cases in China, all imported cases. No new deaths were reported. Also, 2 new cases were reported in Hong Kong, with no new cases reported in Macau. A total of 1756 imported cases have been reported. There have been no new deaths reported for several weeks, further supporting a reduced level of cases in the country.

There were 16 newly confirmed infections in asymptomatic individuals in the past 24 hours: 3 locally acquired, 13 imported. There were no cases of conversion from asymptomatic to symptomatic in the past 24 hours. The last report of a conversion from asymptomatic to symptomatic was a single case on 18 May 2020 (COVID-19 update (194): China, S Korea, countries w/ high local trans, Italy phase 2 20200519.7352327).

Recurrent questions are, what is the total number of asymptomatic cases? What is the total number of symptomatic cases that converted to symptomatic? What is the proportion of asymptomatic imported cases that have been linked to transmission chains resulting in outbreak clusters?

[In the past 24 hours, the tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea has increased by 35 cases and 0 new deaths compared with 27 cases in the previous day (30 May 2020). The daily newly confirmed case count has been at or below 100 for 57 consecutive days. Today's (31 May 2020) breakdown of cases: 30 cases were locally transmitted, and 5 were imported cases. Locally acquired cases were in Incheon (18), Gyeonggi (11), Daegu (1). Imported cases were from Quarantine (2) and 1 each in Seoul, Gyeonggi, and Jeonnam. Note that 12 provinces did not report any newly confirmed cases (compared with 9 provinces and Quarantine on 30 May 2020).

From the English language page (https://www.cdc.go.kr/board/board.es?mid=&bid=0030):

The total number of imported cases was 1259 (plus 5 reported today), with 42.3% coming from the Americas, 37.6% coming from Europe and 17.9% coming from Asia outside of China.

Clusters include:
- Coupang logistics center cluster in Bucheon-si, Gyeonggi Province, in total, 111 cases (75 workers and 36 contacts)
- Yeona News Class, 1st case 30 May 2020, now 4 cases.
- Related to a family (Jangseungbaegi Real Estate Agency Bakchon Branch) in Gyeyang-gu, Incheon City, 11 cases
- Nightclubs, 270 cases (club visitors 96, contacts 174)

Conclusion: COVID-19 in South Korea is importation related with 57.6% of cases identified at the community level (42.4% identified at Port of Entry), and clusters that are fully investigated, tested, and quarantined. Lessons to be learned by other countries. Questions that come to mind include What is the identified asymptomatic rate of tested contacts of confirmed cases? Have any chains of transmission of cluster index cases been traced back to imported cases? If so, how many of these clusters? And, how many imported cases result in local transmission chains?

General trend in "new positives" is downhill.

This is what can be seen from the health monitoring data on the spread of the new coronavirus [SARS-CoV-2] released at 18:00 on [31 May 2020].

- 233 019 cumulative cases, increase of 355 from 30 May 2020;
- 42 075 people are currently positive for the virus;
- 157 507 people have recovered;
- 6387 patients are hospitalized with symptoms, 435 in intensive care, and 35 253 are in home isolation;
- 33 415 deaths have been reported; however, this number can only be confirmed after the Istituto Superiore di Sanita has established the actual cause of death.

[The tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy is now 233 019 cases, including 33 415 deaths, up by 355 cases and 75 deaths in the past 24 hours. The previous day's (30 May 2020) 24-hour change was 416 cases and 111 deaths. The numbers of hospitalized cases and cases in the ICU are also in decline.

Cases still continue to be concentrated in the northern part of the country (see table at http://www.salute.gov.it/imgs/C_17_notizie_4839_1_file.pdf), in Lombardy, the epicenter of the outbreak, Emilia-Romagna, Veneto, and Piedmont. These 4 provinces combined account for 84.8% of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. Lombardy is the only province reporting more than 100 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours (210). Also, 16 provinces reported fewer than 10 newly confirmed cases (5 provinces reported no new cases), another 3 provinces reported fewer than 50 newly confirmed cases, and 1 province (Piedmont) reported more than 50 but fewer than 100 cases, all signs of decreasing local transmission.

The top 5 provinces by cumulative case count are Lombardy, followed by Piedmont, Emilia-Romagna, Veneto, Tuscany, and Liguria. The top 5 provinces by number of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours are Lombardy (210) followed by Piedmont (54), Emilia-Romagna (31), Lazio (13), and Liguria (12).

Italy is now 28 days post phase 2 initial opening up, and 12 days post 2nd stage of phase 2 opening up. All eyes are now on Italy as lockdown restrictions are phased out.

[4] Iran: 151 466 total cases, 7797 deaths
Date: Sun 31 May 2020 20:09 UTC
Source: Middle East Eye/Agence France-Presse (AFP) report [edited]

Iran said its caseload of novel coronavirus infections passed the grim milestone of 150 000 on Sunday [31 May 2020], as the country struggles to contain a recent upward trend. The government has largely lifted the restrictions it imposed in order to halt a COVID-19 outbreak that 1st emerged in mid-February [2020], AFP said. Last week, Iran reopened major Shia Muslim shrines, more than 2 months after they had been closed in the Middle Eastern country worst hit by the outbreak.

But the Health Ministry has warned of a potential virus resurgence with new clusters of outbreaks in several provinces.

Ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour said 2516 new cases were confirmed across the country in the past 24 hours, bringing the total to 151 466. Jahanpour said the virus had claimed another 63 lives in the past day, raising the overall toll to 7797.

Infections have been on a rising trajectory in the Islamic republic since hitting a near 2-month low on [2 May 2020]. Still, according to President Hassan Rouhani, Iran is in "an acceptable situation" which is "not even fragile" anymore. Rouhani said Covid-19's reproduction number used to be more than 2 in Iran, but that it was now "less than one". Such a rate suggests a virus is petering out, according to scientists.

Resurgence of virus
-------------------
Health Minister Saeed Namaki also said that the situation was "completely stable" in all but 4 of Iran's 31 provinces. He warned, however, that in some provinces health "protocols were not being observed and we have witnessed a resurgence of the disease". He identified the provinces as Khuzestan, Hormozgan, and Sistan and Baluchistan. So far, the government has reimposed a lockdown only in Khuzestan province on Iran's southwestern border with Iraq. It remains "red", the highest level on Iran's colour-coded risk scale.

COVID-19 update 122 [data as of 31 May 2020 12:00 CET]
-------------------------------------
[These data are changing daily and are hard to reconcile with data from previous dates. - Mod.MPP]

Situation in Spain:
After combining the data from both surveillance methods, in Spain, at present a total of 239 429 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 27 127 deaths have been reported to date (Table 1, Table 2, Figure 1, and Figure 2) [286 509 - Worldometer accessed at 31 May 17:25 EDT (GMT-4)].

[Given the recent changes in disease reporting by Spain, it is difficult to draw trend comparisons at this time. Only to rehash, according to the 31 May 2020 report, there were 96 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, bringing the confirmed cumulative total to 239 429, a 24-hour decrease from the 271 reported on 30 May 2020. A total of 27 127 deaths are reported as of 31 May 2020, only 2 more deaths than reported on 30 May 2020.

The countrywide 2-week incidence per 100 000 population is now 14.77 (slightly up from 30 May 2020, when it was 14.65), against a continual slow decrease over the past 30 days.

Figure 1 at the source URL above shows the daily confirmations juxtaposed with dates of onset of disease, and one clearly sees the trend for decreasing confirmations in recent times.

In terms of absolute numbers of cases, Madrid has 68 830 cases followed by Catalonia at 59 013, Castile and Leon at 18 886, Castile-La Mancha at 17 234, and Basque Country at 13 508. In terms of population-based rates (per 100 000 population) over the preceding 14-day period, Catalonia is 1st with 39.74 followed by Castile and Leon at 24.63, Madrid with 24.36, Navarre at 20.02, and Castile-La Mancha at 21.60.

According to Table 2, of the 239 429 cases, an additional 263 cases have been hospitalized over the preceding 7 days, and an additional 9 cases were admitted to ICUs over the past 7 days. Overall, 9.2% of hospitalized patients have been admitted to ICUs.
