Another polio case on [Thu 13 Jun 2019] surfaced in Shangla, a district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, ARY News reported.

Sources in Health Ministry said that poliovirus had been confirmed in a 2-year-old boy in Shangla area of KP, bringing the total number of polio cases in the country to [23] this year [2019]. Sources further added that samples of the child were sent for tests on [30 May 2019].

It is worth to note here that Poliovirus is creating havoc in Pakistan and Afghanistan. The virus has been eliminated from the rest of the countries of the world.

With another polio case, the total number for the current year cases has jumped to 23 in Pakistan, out of which, 10 cases were reported in KP, 7 in tribal districts and 3 each in Sindh and Punjab provinces.

The extensive environmental surveillance established by the Pakistan Polio Eradication Programme in previous months detected the polio virus in sewage of 12 cities. According to result shared by the National Emergency Operations Centre (NEOC), the presence of virus was confirmed in sewage samples collected in March 2019 from cities of Peshawar, Lahore, Karachi, Rawalpindi, Mardan, Bannu, Waziristan, Hyderabad, Kambar and Sukkur.

[Confirmed cases reported from Pakistan continue to climb. As mentioned in the above media report (and confirmed on the End Polio Pakistan website: http://www.endpolio.com.pk/polioin-pakistan/polio-cases-district-wise-2019), with the addition of this newly confirmed case, there have been 23 cased of paralytic disease associated with WPV1 infection in Pakistan this year (2019), and global total of 31 (including the 8 confirmed cases in Afghanistan).

As cases have been reported since April [2019] when there was a major campaign, it is likely the pockets of vaccine refusals persist.

Shangla is located in northern KP province, sharing a western border with Swat district, a southern border with Buner district, a northern border with Kohistan district and an eastern border with Batagram and Tor Ghar districts (see https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/pak215_pakistan_districts_v5_a0_20181203.pdf).
