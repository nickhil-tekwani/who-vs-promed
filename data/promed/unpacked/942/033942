Japanese authorities were battling to contain swine flu on Wed (6 Feb 2019) after the virus was detected at multiple sites in central Japan.

Japanese soldiers and local government officials began slaughtering around 6600 pigs at a farm in Toyota City in Aichi prefecture following the confirmation of an outbreak of swine fever, also known as hog cholera, there.

Since January [2019], the farm has shipped pigs to 6 facilities in Nagano, Gifu, Aichi, Shiga, Mie, and Osaka prefectures, according to the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries. It said it had found the virus at all the above places except Mie.

The Nagano prefectural government also started the slaughtering of 2400 pigs at a farm in the village of Miyada.

The government could end up killing a total of 15 000 pigs, Kyodo News agency reported.

"We are facing a critical stage," Farm Minister Takamori Yoshikawa said at a ministry meeting.

In late January [2019], the Gifu prefectural government culled about 2500 hogs in the 7th case of swine fever since September [2018]. Prior to that Japan had not had any cases of the virus since 1992.

[A relevant press release of Japan's Ministry of Agriculture is available at http://www.maff.go.jp/j/press/syouan/douei/190206.html (in Japanese). It includes the following:

"In addition to related farms in Aichi Prefecture, clinically suspected cases of CSF have been observed on farms in the prefectures Nagano, Gifu, Shiga, and Osaka, to where were being moved from the affected farm in Aichi."

The CSF outbreak in Japan started on 3 Sep 2018, on a commercial farm in Gifu prefecture. 10 days later, a dead wild boar, found in the vicinity of the farm, was found to be infected with CSF. The virus strains from the farm and the wild boar were found to be identical, genotyped as genotype 2, subgenotype 2.1, differing from past Japanese strains, closely related to strains Mongolia/2014a and China/2015 (20180921.6043883). Since the start of the event and as of 30 Jan 2019, 7 holdings of domestic pigs in the Gifu prefecture have been found infected, of which 4 commercial farms and 3 backyard farms. The virus was spreading in wild boars, all but 6 within the Gifu prefecture; 6 wild boars were found infected in the territory of the adjacent Aichi prefecture; could this be the source of the current infection on the farm? (see surveillance data further, and map at https://tinyurl.com/ycozaqof; zoom in).

OIE outbreak summary, as of 30 Jan 2019:
Total outbreaks = 111 (submitted)
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Swine / 10 366 / 40 / 31 / 10 335 / 0
Wild boar / 111 / 39 / 72 / 0

Summary of the wild boar surveillance (included in follow-up report no 14, submitted 30 Jan 2019; http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=29352):
As of 28 Jan 2019, 689 wild boars (73 dead and 616 captured) in Gifu prefecture have been tested and 105 (38 dead and 67 captured) were found to be positive for CSF, by RT-PCR, since 13 Sep 2019. 53 wild boars (12 dead and 41 captured) in Aichi prefecture have been tested and 6 were found to be positive (1 dead and 5 captured) for CSF by RT-PCR since 14 Sep 2019. Among the other prefectures, 156 dead wild boars in 36 prefectures were tested and all were found to be negative by RT-PCR since 14 Sep 2019.

Official notification of the outbreak in Toyota City, and lab confirmation of the additional outbreaks in 5 prefectures, are anticipated soon.

Hopefully, the authorities will succeed in preventing the spread of the virus from the newly infected farms into the wild boar populations in the hitherto unaffected prefectures. - Mod.AS
