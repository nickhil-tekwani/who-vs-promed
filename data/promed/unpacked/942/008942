Miltefosine treatment of leishmaniasis
------------------------
Thanks for posting the message on cutaneous leishmaniasis in US
troops deployed in Iraq. I wonder why every case seems to be treated
with i.v. Pentostam. Where scarring is no major problem, a
wait-and-see attitude may be more appropriate.
If treatment seems necessary, another option reported from Israel
many years ago is the oral drug Miltefosine, which I know relief
organizations use on infected Iraqi children with much success.
Is there no line of communication between those institutions? Nor
knowledge of current options in leishmaniasis treatment? Or did the
drug fail? Or is there even more of a registration problem?

[Miltefosine is still in clinical trial, and the following is cited
from the WHO TDR website: "Following on from the registration of
miltefosine (Impavido) in India in the Spring of 2002 (see TDRnews
no. 68), a phase IV clinical trial was launched. Currently almost
1200 visceral leishmaniasis (VL) patients are included in the trial,
most of them from Bihar State, India, with others from Terai, Nepal.
The results of the phase IV study will be of great importance for
undertaking a large-scale evaluation of the levels of patient
compliance and adverse events."
