France Confirms H1N1 Flu Outbreak in Turkeys
--------------------------------------------
Turkeys in a farm for Turkey Breeder Hens in
northwestern France were infected with the H1N1
flu virus, authorities in Cote d'Armor department
announced Thursday [28 Jan 2010]. Laboratory
tests have confirmed the virus in turkeys on the
farm, and the infected turkeys have been
quarantined, authorities said in a statement.

If no further spread of the virus was spotted,
the quarantine would be lifted in 7 days, and
there was no need for massive slaughter, the
statement said, citing relevant guidelines issued
by the European Union and the World Health
Organization in case of animal H1N1 flu infection.

Local health officials warned people with flu
symptoms against close contact with any animals.
The virus has been found in animals including
pigs, turkeys, cats, ferrets and dogs in a dozen
of countries [For the actual number of countries,
see commentary]. The possibility for
animal-to-animal transmission of the virus is
very limited with proper preventive measures,
said the World Organization for Animal Health.

According to the [French notification to the OIE, see
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=8869>],
there have been 3000 cases [in the affected farm,
out of ] 8500 birds [which] have been found susceptible to the disease.

[France has become 20th country in the list of
those which have notified to the OIE, since May
2009, the identification of "Pandemic A/H1N1
virus (2009)" in their respective animal
populations. In all the cases, the source of
infection in animals, mostly subclinical or
manifested by mild clinical signs, was regarded
or suspected to be human patients. Since the
submission of the French notification on 20 Jan
2010, 2 additional countries, namely Japan and
Serbia, have notified their 1st detected animal
cases. In Serbia, there were, reportedly, 20
cases among 10 830 "susceptible" domestic pigs;
the epidemiological comment further said: "The
disease has been detected on a commercial pig
breeding farm during regular epidemiological
control performed by the veterinary inspection.
Affected animals showed respiratory signs of the
disease and therefore, samples were taken and
sent to the laboratory for further investigation.
The source of infection is unknown."

In Japan, there were, reportedly, 164 cases
among 2445 "susceptible" domestic pigs; the
epidemiological comment said: "A worker found the
animals, which showed poor appetite, fever and
cough in the farm occasionally, and reported them
to the Livestock Hygiene Service Centre in
Yamagata prefecture on 12 Jan 2010. 10 animals
which showed clinical signs were sampled. 5 of 10
samples were found to be influenza A positive by
rapid test on 12 Jan 2010 and 7 of 10 samples
were influenza A positive by PCR on 13 Jan 2010.
There were some workers who had been infected
with influenza A virus before the outbreak. On 20
Jan 2010, the virus strains detected from 4
samples were confirmed as pandemic influenza H1N1
2009 by the National Institute of Animal Health
(NIAH). The affected farm is being under
voluntary movement restraint. Epidemiological investigation is continuing."

The full, accumulated list of countries which
have sent at least one notification to the OIE
since May 2009, counts -- as of 31 Jan 2010 --
includes 22 countries. The dates of their 1st notifications are as follows:

A Joint statement of the FAO, WHO and OIE,
originally issued on 30 Apr 2009, said:

"Influenza viruses are not known to be
transmissible to people through eating processed
pork or other food products derived from pigs.

"Heat treatments commonly used in cooking meat
(e.g., 70 C/160 F core temperature) will readily
inactivate any viruses potentially present in raw meat products.

"Pork and pork products, handled in accordance
with good hygienic practices recommended by the
WHO, Codex Alimentarius Commission, and the OIE,
will not be a source of infection.

"Authorities and consumers should ensure that
meat from sick pigs or pigs found dead are not
processed or used for human consumption under any circumstances."

The OIE encouraged members to carry out
surveillance and reporting of the presence of all
epidemiologic events of significance in animals
due to influenza viruses, as well as any other
emerging pathogen.It further stated that "it was
indicated that no evidence has suggested that
animals play any particular role in the
epidemiology or the spread of the pandemic H1N1
2009 virus among humans. Instead, investigations
led by competent national authorities point to
possible human­to­animal transmission in most
cases. For this reason, the OIE considers that it
is sufficient to certify the healthy state of
animals for international trade during the
relevant period before their exportation and
maintains its position that no specific measures,
including laboratory tests, are required for
international trade in live pigs and other
susceptible animal species and/or their products." - Mod.AS]
