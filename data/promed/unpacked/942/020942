Veterinarian who contracted Hendra virus dies in Brisbane
---------------------------------------------------------
A Brisbane vet who fell ill with Hendra virus [infection] has died in
hospital, his employer says. [The veterinarian] and a nurse
contracted the virus infection last month [July 2008] after treating
horses at the Redlands Veterinary Clinic in Brisbane's east.

[The doctor] died in the Princess Alexandra Hospital overnight,
clinic owner David Lovell said today [21 Aug 2008]. "He's been a very
valuable employee with us for quite a long time,'' Mr Lovell told ABC
Radio. "He was the 1st person who became infected in this outbreak
and he's been very, very seriously ill in hospital."

A 2nd veterinary nurse remains in hospital with the disease but Dr
Lovell believes her condition is improving. Dr Lovell told ABC Radio
that he and his staff were devastated by the news of [the vet's] aged
in his 30s, death. "It's terrible, they're very, very upset," he
said. "He's been part of the family for a long, long time." Dr Lovell
said their thoughts went out to [the doctor's] family, especially
[his] wife. "It's just devastating, just spare a thought for them
(the family). For the past 5 weeks they've had to maintain a vigil
against overwhelming odds of chance of success. It's terrible," he said.

Dr Lovell said he could not go into details about [the] nurse's
condition but "some good news there, she's doing quite well." [The
vet] was confirmed with the virus on 13 Jul 2008 but was initially
sent home from hospital before his condition deteriorated a few days
later. He returned to hospital on 16 Jul 2008 and remained in the
infectious diseases unit since.

Also infected with the virus were 5 horses from the Redlands
[Clinic]. Four have died or been euthanised, including one as
recently as last week. [One horse surviving the infection has been
euthanised as a disease security measure; see ProMED-mail Hendra
virus, human, equine - Australia (06): (QLD) 20080820.2592].

A female Department of Primary Industries veterinarian who suffered a
needlestick injury while putting down a racehorse, which had
recovered from the virus, is also in hospital as a precaution.

Two horse trainers, aged 49 and 35, died of the disease in the 1990s;
2 others diagnosed with the infection later recovered, one in 1994,
the other in 2004.

[The death of the Redlands Clinic veterinarian is the 3rd human death
following Hendra virus infection. The 2 previous deaths occurred in
1994 and 1995. Two other persons who were diagnosed with Hendra virus
infection later recovered, and a veterinary nurse who contracted
infection at the Redlands Clinic appears to be recovering
satisfactorily. Thus the case fatality rate for human Hendra virus
infection remains at 50 percent.

One of the 2 previous deaths occurred 13 months after initial
exposure and that case is described by O'Sullivan JD, Allworth AM,
Snow TM, Boots R, Gleeson LJ, Gould AR, Hyatt AD, Bradfield J: Fatal
encephalitis due to novel paramyxovirus transmitted from horses.
Lancet, January 1997, 349 (9045): 93-5 (see
<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8996421>):

A 35-year-old man had a brief aseptic meningitic illness in August
1994, shortly after caring for 2 horses that died from Hendra virus
infection and then assisting at their necropsies. He then suffered
severe encephalitis 13 months later, characterised by uncontrolled
focal and generalised epileptic activity. Rising titres of
neutralising antibodies to Hendra virus in the patient's serum at the
time of the 2nd illness suggested an anamnestic response. Distinctive
cortical changes were shown on magnetic resonance neuroimaging (MRI)
and histopathological examination of the brain at necropsy.
Immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy of brain tissue revealed
pathology characteristic of the earlier cases of Hendra virus
infection. PCR (polymerase chain reaction) on cerebrospinal fluid
taken during the 2nd illness, brain tissue, and serum retained from
the original illness resulted in an amplified product identical to
that previously described in the case of Hendra virus infection.

The clinical details of the illness suffered by the Redlands
veterinarian have not been released.
