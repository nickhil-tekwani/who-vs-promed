With 4 new cases reported last week, the number of patients suffering from malaria has reached 19 this year [2020].

Last year [2019], not even a single case of malaria was reported [up to the same] time. According to SDMC [South Delhi Municipal Corporation], mosquito-breeding has been reported in at least 118 households, and 393 legal notices have been issued this year [2020].

There have been 15 prosecutions of individuals by the civic bodies up to 29 Feb 2020. At least 22 cases of dengue and 14 cases of chikungunya have also been reported this year [2020].

A senior north Corporation official said that all preventive steps have been taken to reduce cases. "The key to prevention of dengue is ensuring there is no clean stagnant water in homes and around, which does not allow the _Aedes_ mosquitoes to breed, and, therefore, dengue cannot spread," he said, adding that zonal officials have been instructed to keep making people aware by organizing seminars and functions in schools and colleges.
