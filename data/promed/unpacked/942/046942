Horse shows have been called off in Illinois to stop the spread of infection after agriculture officials said 2 horses from a northeastern Illinois stable tested positive earlier in May 2015 for the equine herpesvirus.

Other horses at the same stable had signs of the contagious virus. Illinois State Veterinarian Mark Ernst said 2 horses were euthanized and a 3rd horse has shown neurological problems from the infection, the Chicago Tribune reported (http://trib.in/1KiKmIP).

The virus commonly known as EHV-1 can cause respiratory problems, abortion, neurological disease and death in newborn [horses]. Humans are not at risk. The state agriculture department is aware of one stable where horses were infected. It's not clear how the animals were exposed.

"People take it seriously, but you don't need to go overboard," Ernst said. "There's no indication that we have a full-scale outbreak on our hands."

The infected horses were performing at a Midwest Reining Horse Association event 2-3 May 2015 in Gifford in east-central Illinois when they started showing signs, Ernst said. Gifford is about 25 miles northeast of Champaign.

The facility that hosted the event has closed for 3 weeks to disinfect and has canceled shows. Forest preserve officials in DuPage County also canceled horse-related activities at St. John Farm in Warrenville.

"Although we are not aware of any cases in DuPage County, we're proceeding proactively to prevent the further spread of this deadly equine disease," forest preserve President Joe Cantore said.

Ernst said stables generally can resume operations after 28 days without a horse showing signs.

"You have to decide how much risk you want to take with your animal," Ernst .said. "Is it worth it, or is it going to worry you so much that it's probably better to stay home?"

[This disease has a profound effect on horses and owners. Horses have a very tough time recovering from this disease, and owners have a difficult time treating or euthanizing their pets/companions. This disease is not to be toyed with. Owners should heed the words of the veterinarians. Enforce the rest and isolation of your horse. Protect your horse and other horses as well.

This disease can spread fairly fast. It is often recommended to take the animal's temperature at least twice a day to help catch an early rise, which may be the 1st sign of the disease. If there is a rise in resting temperature (1st thing in the morning, before the animals have begun to move around much), then it is advisable to contact your veterinarian immediately.
