New Marburg case reported in Ibanda
----------------------------------
The deadly Marburg virus has claimed 2 more lives, raising the death toll to 7 and scaling up the infected areas.

The 50-year-old mother of the former [deceased] Kabale Regional Referral Hospital mortuary attendant, succumbed to the disease in less than 6 hours after she tested positive. Another person was confirmed dead in Ibanda District, medical officials said. The Kabale District Health Officer, Dr Patrick Tusiime, told this newspaper yesterday [27 Oct 2012] that a retired resident of Bukora Village, Kitumba Sub-county [Kabale district], died in the isolation unit at Rushoroza Health Centre III shortly after midnight.

"A total of cumulative Marburg virus [disease] cases both probable and confirmed in Kabale District is now 14. The total number of admissions at the isolation unit is 7 and the total number of people that got into close contact with the Marburg virus disease victims is now 198. The situation is becoming complicated," Dr Tusiime said.

Marburg virus disease experts currently in Kabale have released a report indicating that a new Marburg case has been confirmed in Ibanda. "The new Marburg virus disease in Ibanda case is of a 32-year-old woman, resident of Sigiria Village, Kihani Parish in Kinkye Sub-county. She was admitted at Mbarara Regional Referral Hospital on 19 Oct 2012 and died 5 days later after having miscarriage. The specimens were collected from her body and they tested Marburg virus positive and a supervised burial was conducted. 7 people that [had] close contact with the deceased have been listed and are being followed up," according to a report issued by Dr Tusiime and the Marburg epidemic experts.

[This report also describes] another of the Marburg victims who was discharged after specimens collected from him tested negative, 6 days after he was admitted at the isolation unit. "[This patient] had lost his 2 brothers, a sister and a mother to Marburg virus disease. The specimens from him tested Marburg positive after he had escaped to Rukungiri for spiritual healing. The Marburg virus experts in Kabale traced him and he was admitted to the isolation unit. Specimens were taken from him again and on 26 Oct 2012 tested negative and he was discharged," Dr Tusiime said.

[The death toll in the Marburg virus disease outbreak in Kabale has now risen from 5 to 7, and the total number of confirmed cases is now 14. A total of 198 people are under surveillance, an increase of 2 since the previous report on 26 Oct 2012. Most, if not all, of the deceased patients appear to be members of the same family. The infection is highly lethal, but does not appear to be spreading rapidly. The conflicting results of diagnostic testing in one case is troubling.

The District of Kabale is located approximately 420 km (261 mi) southwest of Kampala, the capital city of Uganda.
