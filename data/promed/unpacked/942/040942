News of the response
Medical care
------------------------------
- During his visit to the Mangina Ebola Treatment Center (ETC) on Thu 23 Aug 2018, the Minister of Health, Dr. Oly Ilunga Kalenga, witnessed the unloading of 2 patients cured of Ebola. These 2 people are among the first 10 patients to receive the therapeutic molecule MAb114, developed by Professor Jean-Jacques Muyembe and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) from the serum of a survivor of the Ebola epidemic from 1995 to Kikwit. The short-, medium- and long-term observations of patients and survivors will make it possible to evaluate the extent to which the molecule has contributed to their recovery.

Vaccination
------------------------------
- Since vaccination began on 8 Aug 2018, 2957 people have been vaccinated, including 1422 in Mabalako, 701 in Beni, 746 in Mandima and 88 in Oicha.

[Al Jazeera, edited]
https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/08/drc-doctor-stricken-ebola-rebel-stronghold-180824095226217.html

A doctor in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) has been hospitalised with the deadly Ebola virus after coming into contact with nearly 100 people. The World Health Organization (WHO) said on Fri [24 Aug 2018] that investigating the infection and its possible spread to 97 people in contact with the physician would be difficult because the area was entirely surrounded by rebels.

Since the outbreak erupted in DRC on 1 Aug 2018, 103 confirmed and probable cases of Ebola have been identified in North Kivu and Ituri provinces, including 63 deaths, the health ministry said. "It is the first time we have a confirmed case and contacts in an area of high insecurity," said Dr. Peter Salama, WHO's deputy director-general for emergency preparedness and response.

"It is really the problem we were anticipating and at same time dreading," he told a news briefing. Salama also said the Ebola infection occurred in the eastern town of Oicha, 50 km (31 miles) from DRC's border with Uganda.

The area was surrounded by fighters from the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), who he said posed "extremely serious security concerns." WHO and health experts reached Oicha with an armed escort by MONUSCO troops this week, Salama said. 

The DRC's military launched an offensive against the armed group in January [2018] after an attack on Tanzanian UN peacekeepers that killed 15 soldiers. "We are at quite a pivotal moment in this outbreak in terms of the evolution of the outbreak epidemiologically and in terms of the response," said Salama.

[Reuters, edited]

[Byline: Stephanie Nebehay]

A doctor has become the first probable Ebola case in one of the eastern DRC's "high insecurity zones," which are dogged by militia violence and hard to access, a scenario "we have all been dreading," the WHO said on Fri [24 Aug 2018].

The doctor living in Oicha town in North Kivu has been re-hospitalised with Ebola symptoms after his wife was confirmed as having the disease when she traveled to the nearby city of Beni, Dr. Peter Salama, the WHO's head of emergency operations, said.

Oicha is almost entirely surrounded by ADF Ugandan Islamist militia, and there are "extremely serious security concerns," he said. Aid workers, priests and government officials are held hostage in the area, he said. The doctor's initial test for Ebola -- which causes vomiting, fever and diarrhoea -- had been negative, but new results are pending, Salama told Reuters.

Thus far, 97 of the doctor's contacts who may have been exposed to the virus have been identified, and vaccination has begun in the town, Salama added. "So, for the first time really we have a confirmed case and contacts in an area of very high insecurity. It really was the problem we were anticipating and the problem at same time that we were dreading," Salama told a news briefing.

WHO and health experts reached Oicha with armed escort by MONUSCO troops this week, he said, adding: "We know from that incident now in Oicha we are going to have to operate in some very complex environments due to security and access concerns."

In a further worrying development, angry youth burned down a health centre in another village, where vaccinations were underway, after learning of a death from Ebola, Salama said.

More than 2900 people have been vaccinated against Ebola since the outbreak began, he said. "We are at quite a pivotal moment in this outbreak in terms of the evolution of the outbreak epidemiologically and in terms of the response," he said.

[The Guardian, excerpted, edited]
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/24/ebola-drc-outbreak-spreads
[Byline: Jason Burke]

Several cases of Ebola have already been identified in the city of Beni, raising fears of further infection in a crowded urban centre. Just as worrying, health workers said, was a new case in the town of Oicha, which is almost entirely surrounded by an Islamist militia based in Uganda that has been responsible for a series of bloody raids across the region. North Kivu is one of the most violent parts of Congo and is a base for dozens of armed groups that contest government authority and exploit mineral resources in the region.

The WHO said a doctor in Oicha had been hospitalised with Ebola, and 97 of his contacts had been identified. "It is the first time we have a confirmed case and contacts in an area of high insecurity. It is really the problem we were anticipating and at the same time dreading," Salama said.

Karin Huster, coordinator for Médecins Sans Frontières in Mangina, the epicentre of the outbreak, said new patients were arriving at the emergency treatment units every day. "Obviously we are concerned. We are worried that we are not seeing the suspect cases coming into our centres that we should be seeing. It is not a situation where we are confident that the outbreak is under control," Huster said. "It is all about winning the trust of the community. It's super important to come early when they are sick and people often come too late." [more...]

- Fri 24 Aug 2018. Doctor infected with Ebola in DRC conflict zone
[CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Response and Policy), excerpted, edited]
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2018/08/doctor-infected-ebola-drc-conflict-zone

Early today Peter Salama, MD, the WHO's deputy director-general for emergency preparedness and response, said in a telebriefing that the outbreak, which began on 1 Aug [2018] in North Kivu province, is in one of the most dangerous places in the DRC. He explained that North Kivu is a United Nations (UN) security area "stage 4"; stage 5 requires UN evacuation.

"More than 80% of cases are in and around Mangina. If we look within [a] 20 to 30 kilometer [12.5 to 18.5 miles] radius we see the overwhelming majority of cases occurring there," Salama said. "We know that radius contains an accessible population."

Salama said the case involving the physician was confirmed earlier this week in Oicha, a town 30 kilometers [18.5 miles] east of Beni, adding that there are as many as 2 more suspected cases in that town. The index case was likely a physician who traveled to Oicha from Beni and may have infected his wife, Salama said.

The road to Oicha is in a red zone. According to Reuters, Oicha is almost entirely surrounded by ADF Ugandan Islamist militia.

Salama also provided more details on the use of therapeutics in this outbreak. A total of 13 patients have been given the experimental monoclonal antibody treatment MAb114, with positive results, and one patient has been started on remdesivir. More patients are expected to be given remdesivir, an experimental antiviral drug, in the next 2 days.

Finally, Salama recounted the details of angry youths who burned down a health center in the village of Manbangu after they learned of a local death from Ebola. He said community outreach has been strengthened in that village and vaccinations have resumed.

Communicated by:
ProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall

[Dr. Peter Salama of WHO described disturbing new developments in the unfolding North Kivu Ebola outbreak, as reported in the above overlapping articles. Unfortunately, a transcript of his remarks does not seem to be publically available, but key junctures may be viewed at the following time points in the video available at the URL above (total duration 31:33):
8:03 - DRC Ebola update begins
9:19 - 1st suspect case in Oicha, an area of high insecurity
10:53 - Violent reaction in the home village of an Ebola patient who died in the Mangina ETC on 22 Aug [2018]
12:12 - Role of infected healthcare workers in amplifying the outbreak
14:20 - Ring vaccination
15:14 - New experimental therapeutics being deployed
Troubling as some of these developments are, the transparency and forthright manner projected by Dr. Salama is central to building trust and overcoming these setbacks - Mod.LXL

The 2 antiviral compounds mentioned in the posts above are MAb114 and remdesivir. MAb114 is a single monoclonal antibody isolated from a human Ebola virus disease survivor. The antibody is a human IgG1 MAb targeted to the Zaire ebolavirus (EBOV) glycoprotein (GP), blocking its interaction with a receptor on human cells. This is the 1st antibody to demonstrate the ability to neutralize the virus by this interaction between the virus and its cellular receptor. The outbreak in the DRC provides a testing ground for efficacy of this antibody.
Remdesivir, another antiviral drug, is a novel nucleotide analog prodrug, developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for filovirus infections such as Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus, although it has subsequently also been found to show reasonable antiviral activity against more distantly related viruses. - Mod.LK

- Fri 24 Aug 2018. Spiralling violence puts millions at risk in Ebola-hit eastern DRC
[UNHCR press briefing, excerpted, edited]
http://www.unhcr.org/news/briefing/2018/8/5b7fc5ef4/spiralling-violence-puts-millions-risk-ebola-hit-eastern-drc.html

UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, is alarmed by the latest escalation of violence in already volatile and Ebola-hit North Kivu province in east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Forced displacement in this part of the country remains massive. It is estimated that more than one million people are displaced in North Kivu. This is the highest concentration of internally displaced people (IDPs) in the DRC. An estimated half a million people have been forced from their homes this year alone.

UNHCR is particularly worried about the deteriorating situation in the Ebola-hit northern territory of Beni. The area is home to some 1.3 million people. Spiralling conflict has left the population living there virtually in a state of siege since October 2017. Reports of increased human rights violations and restrictions of humanitarian access are frequent. Estimates are that more than 100 armed groups are active in the province, continually terrorizing the population. Despite a large-scale military offensive of the Congolese Army against one of the main rebel groups, the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) since January [2018], there has been no let-up in the violence.

Despite security challenges, a UNHCR team accessed the area north of Beni earlier this month and conducted humanitarian assessments in Oicha and Eringeti districts. Residents told our staff about brutal attacks against the civilians carried out with machetes. Stories of massacres, extortion, forced displacement and other human rights violations are frequent. Sexual and gender-based violence is rampant across the Beni territory. Many children are being recruited as child soldiers. The violence is particularly rampant in the so-called "triangle of death," between the towns of Eringeti, Mbau and Kamango, on the Uganda-DRC border, as well as in the towns of Beni, Oicha and Mavivi.

UNHCR is scaling up its capacity in North Kivu to respond to the growing humanitarian needs. They are arranging additional emergency shelters and other humanitarian assistance to meet the needs of the displaced in Beni. While UNHCR's humanitarian response is continuing despite the outbreak of Ebola, the prevailing security situation and drastic funding shortfall severely hamper their efforts. UNHCR's DRC 2018 appeal totalling USD 201 million is only 17% funded.

[3] Control of viral outbreaks
- Fri 24 Aug 2018. A better method for stopping Ebola and yellow fever
Science Friday [edited]
http://bit.ly/2NdAm8k

From 1976 to 2017, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) experienced 8 outbreaks of the deadly Ebola virus. Then, for 10 weeks earlier this year [2018], the virus reemerged in the country, killing 33 people. Ministry of Health officials finally declared the crisis over on 24 Jul 2018.

But just one week later, on 1 Aug [2018], the DRC reported a new outbreak of the Ebola virus in North Kivu province. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health, joins Ira [Ira Flatow, host of Science Friday] for an update on the latest outbreak of the Ebola virus in the DRC.

Plus, public health officials may not be able to control when and where a viral outbreak will occur. But, with the right strategy, they can keep it from becoming an epidemic. One of these strategies was used with yellow fever, a virus that emerged in Brazil last year [2017] and threatened major population centers like Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro.

In a recent article published in the journal Science, Dr. Nuno Faria of the University of Oxford describes how his team used real-time genome sequencing of the yellow fever virus to track where it came from and which groups might be at risk. He joins Ira to discuss the work.

- Thu 23 Aug 2018. How the human immune system protects against Ebola
[EurekAlert!, AAAS; edited]

Two types of human antibodies that target different parts of the Ebola virus synergize their antiviral effects by inhibiting different steps of infection, according to a study published 23 Aug [2018] in the open-access journal PLOS Pathogens by Philipp Ilinykh and colleagues from the University of Texas Medical Branch, Vanderbilt University, and Ragon Institute. These new insights into how the human immune system protects against Ebola infections could lead to the development of effective antibody-based therapies.

The unprecedented Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa from 2013 to 2016 resulted in more than 11 000 human fatalities, demonstrating the urgent need for treatments against this virus and related highly pathogenic filoviruses. Despite intense international collaborative efforts, there is still no licensed therapeutic available against filovirus disease. Further progress in the development of effective antibody-based therapies for filovirus infections requires a better understanding of the mechanism underlying their protective effect. Although the human immune system can produce strong antibody responses against filoviruses, the effects on multiple steps of filovirus infection have not been clear.

To address this gap in knowledge, Ilinykh and colleagues evaluated the mechanisms underlying the antiviral effects of a diverse panel of monoclonal antibodies obtained from several survivors of natural Ebola virus infections. Monoclonal antibodies that targeted either the glycan cap or stem region of the viral glycoprotein interfered with and targeted different steps of filovirus infection. For example, glycan cap-specific antibodies inhibited viral attachment to the cell surface, cell-to-cell transmission and virion budding. By contrast, stem-specific antibodies triggered the activation of natural killer cells and the destruction of infected cells by monocytes and neutrophils.

Taken together, the findings suggest that different types of antibodies exert cooperative effects by blocking distinct steps of filovirus infection. According to the authors, antibody cocktails that combine complementary antiviral effects should be tested in future studies.

Bukreyev adds, "The current approach for treatment of filovirus infections with antibody cocktails tested in animal models utilizes the principle of targeting of non-overlapping epitopes. Our study suggests that possible synergistic effects of antibodies which block various steps of viral replication should be also considered."
