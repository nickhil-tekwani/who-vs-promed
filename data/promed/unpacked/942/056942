MEASLES - FIJI
**************
A ProMED-mail post

Date: Wednesday, October 08, 1997
From: Ministry of Health and Dr. A. Boladuadua, Director of Primary and
Preventive Health Services

Suva Colonial War Memorial Hospital reports 2 admissions for measles in
September and 1 in October. At least 10 cases have been seen by the
outpatient department in the last month. A relative of the four month old
Fijian girl admitted this month reported that three other children in her
family have contracted the disease in the last two weeks, aged 3, 6 and 17
years, all of whom regularly reside at the Police Academy barracks at
Draiba in Nasese, Suva. One other admission was a six-year-old boy from the
Centrepoint area. There have been no reported deaths. The vaccination
status of the affected individuals is currently being investigated.
Other areas of the country may be affected. Nationally, 28 cases of
measles have been officially reported to the Ministry so far this year,
including 5 during the month of September. The September cases included
two reports in the Suva area, and one report each from Ba, Cakaudrove, and
Serua. The number of officially reported cases is probably an
underestimate of the severity of the outbreak due to low levels of routine
reporting. Unvaccinated individuals should be immunised as soon as possible.
