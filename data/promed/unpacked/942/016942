Pneumonia outbreaks that have killed hundreds of bighorn sheep this winter
[2009-2010] in several western states have wildlife officials grappling
with how to minimize the impact. Wildlife officials say the disease shows
up sporadically in wild herds, but it is unusual to have so many outbreaks
in so many states.

More than 400 bighorn sheep in Nevada, Montana, Utah, and Washington have
died or been killed by wildlife officials this winter [2009-2010], and the
death toll is expected to rise in coming weeks. More than half were from 4
herds in western Montana alone, and 79 of the deaths were from 2 herds in
north eastern Nevada.

18 bighorns have died in south-central Washington, and 26 have been killed
in eastern Utah to stop the spread of the disease. Nevada wildlife
officials say a pneumonia outbreak has killed 79 bighorn sheep in 2
mountain ranges near Elko, and they expect the die-off to worsen.

Nevada Department of Wildlife biologist Caleb McAdoo says 61 dead sheep
have been found in the East Humboldt Range, and 18 dead bighorns have
turned up in the adjoining Ruby Mountains. He says that represents a
mortality rate of 31 per cent of the herd in the East Humboldts and 11 per
cent of the herd in the Ruby Mountains. The ranges are located about 300
miles east of Reno.

Four years ago, pneumonia claimed 80 per cent of the Ruby Mountains herd.
It's the 1st major disease outbreak in the East Humboldts since bighorns
were reintroduced there 18 years ago.

[At this point, with so many dead or dying animals, one has to wonder if
autogenous vaccines administered through well placed darts by experienced
darters might not be a lifesaving measure. While even oral baits have been
suggested, it seems nothing short of slaughtering these animals is being
considered. While there are clearly difficulties in dealing with these
animals, they are not impossible to deal with, or they would never have
been introduced into areas years ago.
