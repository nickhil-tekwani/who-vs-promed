Vampire bats attack 500 people
------------------------------
Rabid vampire bats have attacked more than 500 people in Peru's Amazon. The
attacks occurred in the village of Urakusa, in north eastern Peru, where
the indigenous [Aguaruna] tribe lives. At least 4 people [previously
reported to be children] are believed to have succumbed to rabies as a
result. Medical supplies and vaccines to treat those infected with rabies
have been sent to the tribe. Health teams are looking for people in
communities within 6 miles (10 km) of the outbreak who were attacked by
bats any time in the last 6 months.

Jose Bustamante, a Health Ministry official, said 97 per cent of the 508
people who were bitten have begun receiving an anti-rabies vaccination. It
is expected that the rest -- some of whom have rejected treatment -- will
be vaccinated in the next few days.

Rabies, a virus that causes acute inflammation of the brain, is usually
spread to humans by dog bites and has an incubation period that can last
several months.

[This report confirms a previous report that 4 children have been victims
of vampire bat transmitted rabies (see ProMED-mail Rabies, vampire bat,
human - Peru (02): (AS) susp 20100810.2743) and further reveals that a
total of 508 people are known to have been bitten by vampire bats and have
or are about to receive rabies post-exposure prophylaxis treatment.

The victims are members of the Aguaruna tribe, 25 000 to 30 000 of whom
live in dispersed settlements along the Maranon, Nieve, Potro, Mayo,
Cahuapanas, Cenepa, and Santiago rivers and their tributaries, at
elevations of 200 to 1000 metres (650-3300 ft), in the Amazonas region of
Peru. They make their living primarily by swidden (slash and burn)
horticulture, although some also raise livestock, which may have brought
them into contact with vampire bats.

The original press report is illustrated by a striking photograph of a
vampire bat.
