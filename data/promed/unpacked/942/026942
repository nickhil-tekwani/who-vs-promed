Uganda says it is free of Ebola-like Marburg after an outbreak in September 2014. Ugandan authorities said the east African country was free of Marburg, a virus similar to Ebola, after no new cases had been reported more than a month after a hospital worker died of the disease in the capital.

Transmitted through bodily fluids or by handling infected wild animals, Marburg starts with a severe headache followed by hemorrhaging and kills in 80 per cent or more cases within about a week. There is no vaccine or specific treatment for the virus.

A total of 197 people were in contact with the healthcare worker, but none of them were found to have been infected, junior health minister Sarah Opendi told a news conference. Opendi said 42 days is the minimum period of monitoring before an outbreak is declared contained, and there had been no new cases reported since the death in Kampala on 28 Sep 2014. "This implies that the Marburg outbreak in the country has been completely controlled," she said.

The worst outbreak of Ebola on record has killed nearly 5000 people -- all but a handful in West Africa's Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone -- since March 2014.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared Uganda free of Ebola-like Marburg virus. State minister for primary health care Sarah Opendi made the announcement at a news conference held in Kampala on Tuesday [11 Nov 2014]. The declaration comes 42 days after the initial case was diagnosed at Mengo Hospital.

A Marburg case was confirmed in Mpigi district early last month [October 2014]. As a result, the government made repeated appeals to the public "to remain alert" and observe the precautions to control the spread of the virus.

The Marburg virus is one of the most deadly known pathogens. Like Ebola, it causes severe bleeding, fever, vomiting and diarrhoea. The virus has a 21-day incubation period. The Marburg virus is also transmitted via contact with bodily fluids, and fatality rates range from 25 to 80 per cent.

A Marburg outbreak in Uganda in October 2012 killed 10 people, about half of those who were confirmed infected with the disease. The Ebola epidemic that has been raging in West Africa has so far claimed almost 3500 lives, with Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone worst hit.

[Now with 2 incubation periods since the index (and only known) case of Marburg virus disease in Uganda, and no subsequent cases among numerous contacts, the outbreak is considered over. This is indeed fortunate, particularly given that the case was a healthcare worker, and the potential for it to spread in the healthcare setting was of great concern. (One wonders whether his exposure was in the healthcare setting to an unidentified actual index case; none has been found).

Ugandan health officials should be commended on the thorough and successful containment of a potentially disastrous outbreak. The last outbreak of Marburg in Uganda, in 2012, resulted in 20 probable or confirmed cases and 9 deaths in 4 districts of the country (ProMED-mail archive number 20121123.1422035). - Mod.LM
