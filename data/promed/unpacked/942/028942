We [WHO] apologize for two errors in the note on meningitis in West
Africa posted 11 April. The number of deaths reported in Niger
was 206 [sic] and the number of cases reported in Rwanda was 10.
The revised text follows:

4498 deaths had been reported in Africa. These were mainly
from countries in West Africa where epidemics have continued

accounted for 40% of the cases reported this year,
