The scores of hippos that have died in Binga [district of Matabeleland North] since last week [week of 2 Apr 2017] succumbed to anthrax, the Zimbabwe Parks & Wildlife Authority (ZimParks) said. The areas at risk are those along the Mlibizi River in Binga. The hippos died after drinking water from the channel.

The outbreak was 1st suspected last week [week of 2 Apr 2017], when a dozen hippos died from a disease with signs resembling those of anthrax. ZimParks acting spokesperson Simukai Nyasha said samples were taken for testing and the lab results confirmed the presence of the disease.

The 12 carcasses were recovered from different points in the Kavira Forest and along Mlibizi River, near the Zambezi River. Preliminary findings have shown that there were traces of the bacteria that cause anthrax in the samples that were analyzed. Further tests are currently being done to confirm these initial findings.

The remote district of Binga in Matabeleland North, where the villagers have been feasting on the carcasses unaware of the possible health hazards, is one of the most arid regions in the country. ZimParks have put in place the appropriate measures to suppress the spread of the disease. "These include making sure that the carcasses will not be opened up. [Of course some have already. - Mod.MHJ] The carcasses should be left to rot intact and usually the bacteria causing anthrax die after 3 days [of acidifying decomposition], stopping scavengers from accessing the carcasses through covering and monitoring the remains, until the situation normalizes," said Nyasha. "(It also includes) stopping people from consuming the meat. Meanwhile, we are encouraging the people in the affected area to quickly seek medical assistance if they suspect any symptoms of anthrax."

Nyasha said a joint task force of officials from the National Parks & Wildlife Management Authority, Forestry, Environment Management Authority, the Health ministry, and veterinary department has already been constituted to educate communities on the dangers of consuming meat from the dead hippos, and also on general wildlife conservation issues. Officials discourage eating game meat from the affected area, especially animals found dead. Even if anthrax is not present, the animals could have been poisoned by poachers.

Livestock in the area are being vaccinated, and health officials in surrounding districts are on high alert. Anthrax outbreaks can turn deadly as they did back in 2004 in Malilangwe Wildlife Reserve, killing over 90 percent of some wild herbivore populations.

Binga District lies along the border with Zimbabwe and the Zambezi River valley; see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binga_District.

So far so good, if things are progressing as reported. When hippos are not ashore grazing they tend to cluster in the water of rivers and lakes, and this facilitates exposure to contaminated blood extravasated from anthrax carcasses. Unfortunately, this can result in the deaths of large numbers of hippos. Whether or no further cases are going to appear should be soon apparent as these deaths started on [Sun 12 Mar 2017]. As they have reported no human cases in the month since this started, luck seems to be on their side. Their good public advice may well be working. - Mod.MHJ
