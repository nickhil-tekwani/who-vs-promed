Pet owners are being made to send their animals to quarantine kennels where
conditions are "appalling" and animals dying, according to a television
investigation. Poor conditions were found in the majority of the kennels
investigated and a few offered small, damp, unheated kennels. At least one
broke Government regulations designed to prevent rabies spreading by failing
to incinerate waste.
At one of the kennels a dog died during filming and an elderly alsatian was
put down after developing a severe leg sore. The owner was putting waste
into the drainage system rather than the incinerator, against MAFF rules to
prevent cross-infection. The evidence was uncovered by a reporter, Lindsay
Hawdon, who posed as a kennel maid for six months at six quarantine kennels
and filmed at two. The programme investigated 19 others. The result, "Inside
Quarantine", will be broadcast on Tuesday.
Miss Hawdon described quarantine as "obsolete, ineffective and cruel" and
said: "When I went there myself I couldn't believe how appalling the
conditions were." Under the current law, owners have to send their pets into
quarantine for six months at a cost of around Â£1,500, while other countries
stipulate only a vaccination and blood test.
The findings of the Channel 4 film were backed by the Royal Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, which is campaigning to end quarantine,
wanting instead a system of microchips, pet passports, vaccinations and
blood tests. The RSPCA said that 5,000 dogs went through quarantine every
year. Julie Briggs, a spokesman, said the organisation was "very concerned"
about quarantine kennels but did not have the power to inspect them.
The film includes an interview with Jack Done, head of pathology at MAFF
[Central Veterinary Laboratory between 1967 and 1984. He claimed that the
two "confirmed" cases of rabies contained in quarantine, in 1983 and 1990,
were false. He said: "If we had no quarantine between 1970 and today we
would still have had the same number of cases of rabies - zero."
Inside Quarantine will be shown on Tuesday at 9.30pm on Channel 4.
