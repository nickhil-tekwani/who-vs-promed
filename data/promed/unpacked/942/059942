Rabies case count update
------------------------
Amlapura (The Bali Post) has reported that a 22-year-old resident of
Celagi village, Peladung, Karangasem is the 16th rabies fatality in
Karangasem. She died on early Wednesday (5 May 2010), after being
treated briefly in Sanglah Hospital. Three months ago, the victim
tried to separate her chickens and suddenly got bitten by her dog.

There were 3 wounds on her right arm, she suffered cramps on the arm
ever since. She went to local puskesmas (health center). Since they
didn't have vaccine her wound was treated as a normal bite wound. At
that time the victim was advised to go to the Karangasem Hospital to
be vaccinated. Due to her lack of knowledge on rabies, the victim did
not follow this advice. A few days ago the victim fell ill, and was
taken to Karangasem Hospital. The hospital medical team could not
save her as she had already developed symptoms of rabies virus
infection. [This victim is listed as the 48th fatality in Indonesia
in the table below.]

The most recent 2 victims were a 30-year-old resident of Saren kangin
and another from Budakeling, Karangasem. No vaccine was available at
either Puskesmas or in Karangsem to treat these patients. [These
victims are listed as the 37th and 49th deaths in the table below.]

The 49th death reported by Bali media with the name and/or
description of victim, description of symptoms, and identification of
dog bite history, was officially identified as the 37th death.

In fact this would have been the 78th death, counting reports of
deaths not identified by specific details that permit confirmation.

[Since the last report posted on ProMED-mail on 5 May 2010 the number
of human deaths from rabies virus infection in Bali has increased
from at least 46 to at least the 49 currently listed (although
unofficially the toll is estimated to be at least 78). The list of
officially confirmed cases illustrates a widespread geographic
distribution of cases, a wide span of ages of the victims, and an
apparent absence of any non-native inhabitants.
