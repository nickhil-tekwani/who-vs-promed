From: Hal Nash <HNASH@wwcc.cc.wy.us>

Seems to me that a broader approach to rotavirus infection control would be
the implementation of water and sewage sanitation in the countries now
lacking this technology. Tremendous benefits beyond rotavirus control are
a virtual certainty. Not only is it controlled, but all of the other food
and water-borne infectious diseases would experience a precipitous drop in
occurrence. And finally, it has been shown that the incidence of nearly
all infectious diseases plummet on the heels of adequate water and sewage
sanitation. Perhaps, rather than focusing so much on the molecular biology
of a viral vaccine, we should re-focus on the old adage that says, "The
simplest answer is often the best."
If my suggestion of re-directing efforts toward the unglamourous idea of
good old water and sewage sanitation is unpalatable, I'd like to know why,
and why it is this hasn't been implemented already.

[We had a previous message from someone who suggested that decreased breast
feeding was a cause of rotavirus prevalence. While the simplest answer may
often be the best, it is not always the best. We are not communicating
here by banging on hollow logs.
I have always held that the single greatest advantage the U.S. has had is
the dual water system, i.e., one for drinking the other for not drinking.
Say what you will, we are a healthy lot and when we are not, when enteric
organisms attack us, it usually has something to do with the water/sewerage
supply.
Were we all to beat our swords into sewer pipes we might make some headway
in this health business, as Hal suggests. That said, we ain't going to do
that; we all know that. So we go for the quick cure, vaccines. May not be
the best in the long run but it's a lot better than waiting for some ideal
to occur. In addition, if we can prevent the last case of poliomyelitis
from occurring, there won't be any more poliomyelitis. Of course, there
will be other things coming down the pipe and we will have to
short-sightedly have to deal with them ad nauseum but at least it won't be
polio. Rotaviruses are another, different story but preventing rotavirus
illness now is a darn sight better than not.
Suggest to the Third (and Fourth) World countries that they might consider
improving their sewerage and see what reply you get. - Mod.CHC
