Government given 3 month deadline
---------------------------------
Breeders of fighting cocks and indigenous chickens have threatened to hold
a mass rally on 15 Dec 2004 to demand approval to vaccinate non-farm
chickens against avian influenza, if the government fails to stop its spread.
"The government has about 3 months to prove it can contain bird-flu
infections without the vaccination," Fighting Rooster Professional
Promotion Association chairman Yuenyong Opakul said yesterday [Sat 25 Sep
2004]. Yuenyong, who is leader of the Carabao song-for-life band, said he
would allow time for the government to fight the avian viral disease,
although he opposes its ban on vaccination.
He said breeders of non-farm chickens would fully cooperate in implementing
quarantine, and other health measures, in the next 3 months. "The
cooperation will prove whether the government's methods work," he said.
Yuenyong also alleged that police and livestock officials had demanded
bribes from breeders in exchange for turning a blind eye to the
inter-provincial transportation of fighting cocks. He urged the Senate to
open a hearing on the issue.
The chairwoman of the Thai Indigenous Chicken Conservation and Development
Association, Prathana Ngamwongwan, said the government would eventually
approve vaccination against bird flu. "I am certain that present measures
to contain the spread of bird flu won't work," she said.
The Public Health Ministry, meanwhile, declared a nationwide health alert,
following 3 recent deaths suspected to have been caused by bird flu
infections. "The alert is meant as a precaution, and it should not be
construed as a worsening situation," said public health minister Sudarat
Keyuraphan, reacting to a statement from the World Health Organization
expressing concern that a mother and child case incident in Kamphaeng Phet
could be the 1st transmission of the lethal avian virus between humans.
Sudarat said WHO was concerned, but scientific checks would have to be
completed before any conclusions could be drawn from the case. Charal
Trinvuthipong, director-general of the Department of Disease Control, said
there was one more suspected bird flu case, a 6 year old boy in Prachin
Buri. The suspect, the son of a suspected bird flu victim, was rushed into
Kamphaeng Phet Hospital 3 days ago.

[The controversy regarding avian vaccination between Thai poultry growers
for the local market and exporters has been discussed previously (see ref).
In view of the approaching fall and winter months (when a seasonal rise in
influenza incidence might be expected), and considering the zoonotic
aspects of H5N1, the attitude of the public health authorities towards
poultry vaccination might carry weight in the final decision. - Mod.AS]
