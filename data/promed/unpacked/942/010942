Abstract: Bats are increasingly recognized to harbor a wide range of
viruses, and in most instances these viruses appear to establish
long-term persistence in these animals. They are the reservoir of a
number of human zoonotic diseases including Nipah, Ebola, and severe
acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). We now report the identification
of novel groups of astroviruses in apparently healthy insectivorous
bats found in Hong Kong, in particular, bats belonging to the genera
_Miniopterus_ and _Myotis_.

Astroviruses are important causes of diarrhea in many animal species,
including humans. Many of the bat astroviruses form distinct
phylogenetic clusters in the genus _Mamastrovirus_ within the family
_Astroviridae_. [The other genus in the family, the genus
_Avastrovirus_, comprises species of astroviruses infecting birds. - Mod.CP]

Virus detection rates of 36 percent to 100 percent and 50 percent to
70 percent were found in _Miniopterus magnater_ and _Miniopterus
pusillus_ bats, respectively, captured within a single bat habitat
during four consecutive visits spanning one year. There was high
genetic diversity of viruses in bats found within this single habitat.

Some bat astroviruses may be phylogenetically related to human
astroviruses, and further studies with a wider range of bat species
in different geographic locations are warranted. These findings are
likely to provide new insights into the ecology and evolution of
astroviruses and reinforce the role of bats as a reservoir of viruses
with potential to pose a zoonotic threat to human health.

[According to Wong et al (Rev Med Virol. March-April; 17(2): 67-91,
abstract available at <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17042030>),
about 60 virus species are associated with bats. Almost all are RNA
viruses, which are potentially important in the generation of
emerging and re-emerging infections in humans. The prime examples of
these are the lyssaviruses, the henipaviruses (Hendra and Nipah),
SARS coronavirus, and the filoviruses Ebola and Marburg. The
association of specific bat viruses with particular bat species
implies co-evolution between specific viruses and their bat hosts.
Certain families of bats including the _Pteropodidae_, _Molossidae_,
_Phyllostomidae_, and _Vespertilionidae_ are most frequently
associated with known human pathogens.

The astroviruses are small non-enveloped RNA-containing viruses
present in the gut, transmitted by the fecal-oral route, and
associated with gastroenteritis in several hosts including humans.
Distinctive species of astroviruses are associated with specific
mammalian and avian hosts. It remains to be established whether any
of the novel astroviruses associated with bats have an ability to
infect humans or other species of animals. - Mod.CP]
