In response to Dr. Gerry Eddy: B. Dietzshold and H. Carbaugh reported on
the "Introduction of Protective Immunity Against Infection with North
American Bat and Dog Street Rabies Virus Strains by Chiron Behring Rabies
Vaccine." at the 8th Annual Rabies in the Americas Conf., 2-6 Nov, 1997,
Kingston, Ont. They reported that in vitro viral neutralization tests using
sera from veterinary student volunteers (n = ~80) immunized with either
HDCV (Imrab) or PCECV (RabAvert) - 3-dose pre-exposure regimen - developed
protective levels of antibodies against a Texas dog and a silver-haired bat
rabies virus variant (strains) on the NIH mouse protection test. His report
has been submitted to the journal "Vaccine" for publication.
In addition, we have conducted two clinical trials comparing this PCECV and
the USA licensed HDCV for pre-exposure (both trials involved booster doses
after the initial series; no Type III hypersensitivity (or other
significant adverse event) was noted using RabAvert as the booster vaccine).
We found the newly licensed PCECV (RabAvert) to be at least equal to the
HDCV for safety (adverse events) and efficacy (antibody response).
