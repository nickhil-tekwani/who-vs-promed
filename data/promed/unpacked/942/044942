[Bolivia is an FMD-infected country where vaccination is practiced. It will
be interesting to obtain information about the age and the vaccination
status of the affected animals/herds.
The current outbreak, recorded in the Chuquisaca department, is situated in
south-central Bolivia. The Bolivian authorities are obviously concerned
that it will spread to the zone of Chiquitania in southeast Bolivia. The
latter has recently been recognized by the OIE as an "FMD-free zone where
vaccination is practised", according to the provisions of Chapter 2.1.1. of
the International Animal Health Code. - Mod.AS]
