Henrico County Health officials say that the _Salmonella_ outbreak at the
International House of Pancakes on West Broad Street has reached "epidemic"
proportions. 58 cases have now been linked to the restaurant, and
authorities say that six people are being treated at area hospitals. In
addition, the health director says 12 IHOP employees have complained of
salmonellosis symptoms.

Hundreds of calls have come in from people complaining of salmonellosis
symptoms. The director said they are all linked to the IHOP on West Broad
Street. That restaurant has been closed since Wednesday.

"We're having trouble keeping count because the number continues to go up.
This morning there were 70 people who were symptomatic and by lunchtime it
was around a hundred and this afternoon it is about 120. So as the number
continues to rise it is difficult for us to keep count," said Dr. Curtis
Thorpe of the Henrico Health Department.
In addition to customers complaining of salmonella poisoning, health
officials said that at least 12 employees are also complaining.
They have sent food samples to the state laboratory for testing and they do
not know when the restaurant will reopen. Health officials are pretty sure
breakfast food is to blame, but they dont know just which food.

SYMPTOMS
We have some more details about the symptoms of _Salmonella_ poisoning.
Health officials say nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and fever are just some of
the signs that youve been struck by the bacteria. Doctors say if you have
any of these symptoms, you should seek medical attention immediately.

Update filed: 6/08/99 6pm
A pancake restaurant will remain closed because the number of
food-poisoning cases traced to the eatery continues to rise, health
officials said yesterday.
Henrico County health officials closed the International House of Pancakes
on West Broad Street last week because people who ate there were becoming
ill with _Salmonella_ infections.
Forty cases were confirmed by yesterday afternoon, said Dr. Curtis W.
Thorpe, director of the Henrico Health Department. "It gets bigger every
day. There's no way we can let the restaurant open when there's more cases
every day," Thorpe said. Twelve restaurant employees, including four cooks,
reported symptoms. The cause of the outbreak has not been determined.
The eatery will remain closed until the infection has run its course,
Thorpe said.
