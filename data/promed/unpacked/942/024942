Fall in immunity led to outbreak of pertussis
---------------------------------------------
Waning immunity from primary immunisation is to blame for last
month's pertussis outbreak, which affected a quarter of the children
at a village school in Leicestershire, communicable disease
specialists have said.
Primary vaccination uptake among the 87 children at Stathern Village
School was high, and only one child who contracted whooping cough had
not been vaccinated.
But Gerry Bryant, public health specialist at Leicestershire Health
Authority told GP [General Practitioner] that by the age of 5 the
protection offered by primary vaccination can decline by 50 percent.
"The age booster was introduced in November [2001] because we
anticipated the increase in pertussis," she said.
All children attending Stathern primary school have now been given
the school entry DTPa [diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis
vaccine] booster.
The vaccine is only licensed for children up to 7 because of
potential side effects of the diphtheria component. The Public Health
Laboratory Service (PHLS) is monitoring side effects.
"If they are not too bad, we might consider introducing catch-ups in
the future," said Dr Mary Ramsay, an immunologist [sic, actually an
epidemiologist - Mod.SH] at the PHLS. She warned a peak in the 4-year
pertussis cycle was due this year.

[Given past concerns, whether entirely well-founded or not, about
whole cell pertussis vaccine use by older children or adults, the use
of the acellular pertussis vaccine in this cohort has been still an
issue. It appears, as in this UK school outbreak, that waning
immunity is a significant issue that needs to be addressed. It
appears that the acellular vaccine is safe and immunogenic in adults
(1,2), and boosters of the vaccine have been felt to have potential
benefits in the problem of waning immunity even in adults (3).
