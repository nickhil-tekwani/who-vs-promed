European nations impose ban on Russian and Ukrainian pork imports
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Germany has banned the import of pork products from Russia and Ukraine because of the continuing African swine fever (ASF) epidemics in those countries.

A few days earlier Lithuania and Moldova made the decision to ban pork from the Ukraine. The 2 countries are tightening biosecurity control measures along the borders with the 2 countries.

The German veterinary services have also banned the transportation of any pork food products from Russia and Ukraine.

The official report states: "The Ministry of Agriculture warns our citizens entering into Germany from Russia and Ukraine, that they should completely abandon the transportation of meat, sausages, bacon, and other pork products. This measure is implemented due to the outbreaks of African swine fever in these countries."

The ban on pork food products was initiated entered due to suspicions that ASF may have travelled to the Ukraine from Russian via transported luggage.

Pork and live pigs import from the Ukraine were also banned by Moldova and Lithuania.

However, the Ukraine has managed to reach an important agreement with the Customs Union, that the Union will not impose a ban on Ukrainian pork.

[The Ukrainian ASF outbreak of 30-31 Jul 2012 involved a small backyard holding where 5 pigs were maintained, of which 3 were clinically affected and died. The remaining 2 were reportedly destroyed upon receipt of the lab PCR test on 31 Jul 2012.

On 20 Aug 2012, the Ukrainian chief veterinary officer submitted a 2nd follow-up report, according to which, no additional ASF cases have been recorded since 31 Jul 2012. Reportedly "a full range of measures to eradicate the outbreak are being carried out. The quarantine continues".

It remains to hope that the action undertaken will prevent spread of the virus, provided no wild boars have been involved before or during the event and introductions/importation of contaminated food/feed of swine origin from infected territories, such as Russia, is excluded.

Russia submitted its 93rd ASF follow-up report on 22 Aug 2012, informing about 11 new outbreaks, of which one was reported in Yaroslavl oblast (region), 4 in Tver oblast, one in Rostov oblast, and 5 in Krasnodar Krai (territory) (eastern coast of the Black Sea), 2 of which are located close to Ukraine's Crimea; see interactive map at http://web.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=12225.

One of the new Russian outbreaks involved a wild boar (hunting ground in the Tver oblast); all other 10 outbreaks were recorded in domestic pigs on commercial or backyard farms. In total, there were 887 clinical cases in 10 holdings of domestic pigs, including 16 410 susceptible animals, of which 670 died and 15 740 were destroyed.

An interactive map of Russia showing the locations of 233 ASF outbreaks reported since September 2009, is available at http://web.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=8462. - Mod.AS
