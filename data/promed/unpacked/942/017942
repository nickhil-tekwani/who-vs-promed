Wild Horse Roundup Ends
A roundup of wild horses to halt the spread of a deadly equine virus has
wrapped up with Utah's state veterinarian saying he believes the threat is
over. Dr. Mike Marshall made the prediction Tuesday as trucks carrying 12
foals that tested positive for equine infectious anemia left Utah for
Oklahoma. The foals will become part of a research project into EIA at the
Boren Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital. "This is the medically sound,
compassionate solution we were all hoping for," said Don Banks of the
Bureau of Land Management.
The BLM conducted the roundup of horses that began in March. Of the 1,364
horses captured by the bureau, 127 tested positive for EIA. All but the
foals were killed.
Marshall had insisted all of the positive-testing animals be killed,
despite research showing that healthy foals often test positive to EIA
because of antibodies passed on by their infected mothers. It can take up
to eight months for the antibodies to be flushed from their systems.
Animal rights groups sued to stop the killings and won a restraining order.
The order was extended twice and expired Monday as the BLM was finalizing
the deal with Oklahoma.
EIA is a blood-carried virus passed from animal to animal by biting
insects. Roughly a third of infected animals die, and the others become
carriers.
