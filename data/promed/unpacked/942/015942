The Norwegian Veterinary Institute has discovered salmonella in a stool sample from a calf with bloody diarrhea in a herd of dairy cows in Nordland, Norway.

Salmonella bacteria are divided into serovars, and of these, _Salmonella typhimurium_ is the most commonly detected in animals in Norway. _Salmonella typhimurium_ is also a common cause of salmonella infections in humans.

The incidence of salmonella in Norway is very low, but it is detected occasionally in cattle in clinical disease, and in conjunction with sampling in the monitoring program for salmonella. This is the 2nd detection of salmonella in cattle in 2015. In July 2015, _Salmonella typhimurium_ was identified in samples from dairy cows with bloody diarrhea in the same region.

[Norway launched a nationwide official surveillance and control programme for salmonella in 1995, covering both live animals (cattle, swine and poultry) and meat products (from cattle, swine, sheep and poultry). If salmonella is detected, action is taken to prevent spread of the bacteria and epidemiological investigations are initiated in order to find and eliminate the source of the infection or contamination. After joining the EU, Norway was granted a status of official freedom from specific animal diseases. Furthermore, the EU acknowledged Norway's favourable salmonella situation. Similarly to Sweden and Finland, Norway can require additional guarantees in regard to salmonella when importing live animals and feed and food products of animal origin from the EU. The Norwegian, Finnish and Swedish Salmonella control programmes are very similar.

Since the establishment of the surveillance programme in 1995, the annual prevalence of salmonella has been below 1 per cent in the different categories of samples.

All samples from live animals are analysed by the Norwegian Veterinary Institute (NVI), while the samples taken at slaughter houses (lymph nodes, carcass swabs) are analysed in private laboratories (in agreement with the Norwegian Food Safety Authority). All the data are presented in annual reports. In cattle, the surveillance is based on sampling a representative proportion of all cattle slaughtered in Norway. A total of 3000 lymph node samples from cattle should be collected at slaughter. The estimated sample size for each slaughterhouse ranges from 1 to 726 and is based upon the number of onsite-slaughtered animals in relation to the national total. The sampling is distributed evenly throughout the year.

Acording to NVI's annual report for 2014 (cattle), a total of 3279 lymph node samples from cattle were examined. One sample was positive for salmonella (_S. typhimurium_), giving an estimated salmonella prevalence of 0.03 per cent (95 per cent confidence interval: 0.0008 - 0.2 per cent) at the individual carcass level.
