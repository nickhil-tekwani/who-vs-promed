[Ref: NH Maktar et al: _Erwinia papayae_ causing papaya dieback in
Malaysia. BSPP New Disease Reports, vol. 17]
------------------------------------------------------------------
A papaya dieback disease was first reported in Malaysia by the Johor
State Department of Agriculture in 2003. By the end of 2006 it had
spread to 5 other states on the west coast of the Malaysian
peninsula, affecting about 800 ha (1980 acres) and resulting in the
destruction of around one million trees. Total yield losses were
estimated at 200 000 metric tonnes, equivalent to USD 58 million.
Early symptoms included yellowing and necrosis along leaf edges
followed by water-soaked areas on the bases of leaf stalks, crowns
(Fig. 1) and along leaf mid- ribs. Fruit symptoms included dark spots
on the skin and water-soaked flesh (Fig. 2). Later, necrotic and
water-soaked areas developed on stems and spread to the internal
tissues, followed by secondary fungal infections. In advanced stages
bending of water-soaked leaf stalks occurs, leading to dieback, and
death of trees (Fig. 3).

Hyaline bacterial colonies were consistently isolated. Isolates were
Gram-negative rods, facultative anaerobes, oxidase negative and
catalase positive. A total of 6 isolates were tested for tobacco
hypersensitivity and gave a strong response within 10-12 h.
Pathogenicity was tested by inoculating suspensions into crowns and
leaf stalks of 5-month-old healthy papaya plants. Characteristic
symptoms were observed one week after inoculation. No symptoms were
observed on control plants. The original bacterium was re-isolated
from symptomatic plants and one isolate was sent to a commercial
service for 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The isolate was identified as
_Erwinia papayae_ , with the highest similarity to _E. papayae_ from
the Caribbean. PCR [polymerase chain reaction] using phytoplasma
specific primers ruled out the involvement of phytoplasma.

This is the 1st report of _E. papayae_ causing papaya dieback in
Malaysia. The disease may have entered Malaysia via Johor, then
spread to other states by human activity and possibly birds and
insects. The 1st report of this disease in S.E. Asia was in Java in
1931. _E. papayae_ was first reported as causing bacterial canker of
papaya in the Caribbean in 2004.

[Papaya (_Carica papaya_) is a significant food crop in small farming
systems worldwide, as well as an economically important tropical cash
crop. Several species of the genus _Erwinia_ have been reported to be
associated with diseases in papaya, including _E. herbicola_, _E.
cypripedii_ (black rot), and _E. papayae_. The latter was
characterised and described as a novel species in 2004.

Bacterial dieback of papaya is sometimes also referred to as
bacterial canker or stem canker. Symptoms generally include greasy,
water-soaked lesions and leaf spots, as well as water-soaked cankers
on the stem, which may lead to death of the tree.

_Erwinia_ is a genus of _Enterobacteriaceae_ containing mostly plant
pathogenic species. Some members cause serious crop diseases, for
example _E. amylovora_ (fireblight of pome fruit) and _E. carotovora_
(multiple hosts). These bacteria produce enzymes that hydrolyse
pectin between individual plant cells causing the cells to separate
and affected plant tissue to rot.

Because Australian papaya dieback is a severe disease caused by a
phytoplasma, this group of pathogens has been tested but ruled out as
the cause of the disease in Malaysia in the report above.
