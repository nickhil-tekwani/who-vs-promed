Concerning the complex emergency in Liberia, while I have no specific
numbers to update your most recent posting on cholera (4 Jul 2003, posting
20030704.1644) here is some germane information I have edited from a
UN/IRIN release.
According to the IRIN report, Acting Minister of Health Nathanial Bartee
said on Wed, 9 Jul 2003 that the John F. Kennedy Medical Center in the
capital of Monrovia ..."can no longer maintain the influx of cholera
patients, most of whom are internally displaced persons (IDPs)." Bartee
stated that, while cholera cases always peak in the rainy season of July
and August, the present situation is exacerbated by the current civil
instability. He confirmed that JFK was recording at least 5 cases per day
and that 10 cases per week have been reported from Samuel K Doe Stadium,
where perhaps 10 000 displaced persons are congregated.
Aid workers continue to report (cholera) outbreaks at most shelters (as
well as other communicable diseases including measles). Based on various
internet sources, the number of IDPs in Monrovia is estimated at 100 000 to
perhaps several hundred thousand.
In the IRIN release, Francis Matsanga of the UN OCHA is quoted as saying
the hospitals are overwhelmed and relief agencies such as MSF-Belgium and
MERLIN are flying in more staff and opening additional treatment centers in
Central Monrovia and at Greystone, respectively. The latter is a compound
near the US Embassy that apparently received incoming shells from rebels
during the assault on the Mamba Point area in late June.
After a shaky start yesterday, IRIN is reporting that the US military
assessment team presently on the ground in Liberia will be permitted to
visit hospitals, clinics and camps in areas controlled by government militia.
