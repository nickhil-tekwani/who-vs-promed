["Sheep pox (SP) and goat pox (GP) [SGP] are caused by _Capripox_ viruses, a genus which also includes the lumpy skin disease (LSD) of cattle. SGP are highly contagious diseases of sheep and goats characterised by fever and ocular and nasal discharges. Pox lesions appear on the skin and the respiratory and gastrointestinal mucosa. These diseases may be mild in indigenous breeds living in endemic areas, but they are often fatal in newly introduced animals. Economic losses result from decreased milk production, damage to the quality of hides and wool, and other production losses."
(https://rr-asia.oie.int/en/projects/sheep-pox-and-goat-pox/)

"Sheep pox and goat pox are endemic in north and central Africa, parts of the Middle East, Turkey, and some parts of Asia including the Indian subcontinent. Frequent outbreaks in Greece and occasional outbreaks in Bulgaria are thought to be caused by viruses that enter these countries during outbreaks in Turkey."

SGP (sheep pox and goat pox) do not pose a risk to human health. - Mod.CRD
