Research fails to find link between beef and CJD
By Celia Hall, Medical Editor
THE largest study to date of the risks of contracting the human form of mad
cow disease [CJD, not nvCJD. MHJ] has found no evidence of links with eating
beef, veal, lamb cheese or dairy products or from blood transfusions. The
study of risk factors involved in Creutzfeldt Jakob disease from the
European Collaborative Study Group, has found a tendency for there to be
higher levels of dementia, not caused by CJD, in the families of the cases
that they investigated.
The cases studied, which included a large group of British patients, looked
at "classical" CJD. Dr Cornelia van Duijn, of the Erasmus University Medical
School, Rotterdam, who led the study, said that while a small number of
cases of new variant CJD were included the numbers were too small for them
to be considered separately. As it is new variant CJD that has been most
closely associated with eating beef, the researchers say their findings must
be treated cautiously until more information is available.
The team from Britain, the Netherlands, France, Belgium, Germany and Italy
looked in detail at 199 definite and 206 probable cases of CJD between 1993
and 1995 and compared them with 405 matched controls. They included 88
British cases investigated by the CJD Surveillance Unit at the Western
General Infirmary, Edinburgh. Family histories, medical histories, diet,
lifestyle, and occupation were studied in detail in the patients and the
controls and compared.
The study in The Lancet found that 54 cases, compared with 22 controls, had
larger numbers of first-degree relatives who suffered from other forms of
dementia. The researchers also found a link between CJD and eating raw meat,
brain and pork, with using fertilisers containing cow hoof and horn and
exposure to leather, including wearing it. But workers in the leather
industry showed no increased risk of CJD.
Dr van Duijn said yesterday that they did not understand the leather
findings. The higher risk among pork eaters was also a puzzle since there is
no increase of spongiform encephalopathy, the animal brain disease, in pigs.
She said: "We have looked at classical CJD in a narrow time frame. It is by
far the largest study ever conducted, but we have to wait a lot longer to
get a real picture". Even significant links could reflect a "statistical
fluke" rather than a genuine cause and effect.
The researchers think that sufferers may have an inherited susceptibility to
a number of conditions that include Alzheimer's disease and prion protein
disorders. Prions are the agents found in cases of CJD.
