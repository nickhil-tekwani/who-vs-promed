W.H.O. Delays End of Smallpox Virus
-------------------------------
GENEVA, May 18 Â¯ The World Health Organization agreed today to delay the
planned destruction of the world's remaining stocks of the deadly smallpox
virus to allow more time to develop new vaccines and treatments.
The W.H.O., a United Nations agency, had set the end of 2002 as the
deadline for eliminating the stocks. But the anthrax attacks last fall in
the United States renewed fears that militants or so-called rogue states
could use the germs as a weapon.
Smallpox was once one of the world's most feared diseases, killing about
one-third of its victims. Its official eradication in 1977 was considered a
major success.
Health officials had planned to stamp out any possibility of the disease's
recurrence by destroying the last stocks of the variola virus, which are
stored in the United States and Russia. But there was concern that some
might have fallen into the wrong hands and that available vaccines could
not be given to people with weakened immune systems.

U.N. Drops Smallpox Stocks Destruction
-------------------------------------------
GENEVA (AP) -- Acting on fears of bioterrorism, the 191 World Health
Organization members on Saturday formally reversed a long-standing order
for the destruction of all smallpox virus stocks and recommended they be
retained for research into new vaccines or treatment.
The World Health Assembly, the U.N. health agency's top decision-making
body, decided to back an earlier recommendation by WHO Director-General Gro
Harlem Brundtland to drop a 2002 deadline for destroying the virus, held at
top security laboratories in the United States and Russia.
In January, the WHO's 32-member Executive Board approved Brundtland's
policy. Late Friday, a World Health Assembly committee representing all
member nations also backed the move.
Under the ruling, no new target has been set for destroying the stocks,
which are held at 2 secure laboratories at the U.S. Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention in Atlanta and a similar Russian facility in
Siberia. The virus stocks will instead be retained for research into new
vaccines or treatment for smallpox. The World Health Assembly will receive
updates on the research at its annual meetings.
U.S. assistant surgeon general Kenneth Bernard told the assembly that
smallpox research was necessary because the ``events of Sept. 11 have
underscored the extent that terrorists are willing to go to.''
``In recent years, experts have come to see smallpox as a No. 1 deadly
threat,'' and the danger of deliberate use was ``small but growing,'' he
said. ``We regard the potential release of smallpox as a critical national
security issue, not only for us but for the entire world.''
Research also would help people suffering from HIV/AIDS, whose weakened
immune systems could not stand existing smallpox vaccines, he added.
The assembly said that full research results should be made available to
all WHO member nations. WHO officials said that decision came after
developing countries on the assembly said they feared rich nations would
keep the results to themselves.
Smallpox used to kill 3 million to 4 million people per year and left
millions more hideously scarred and blind. It was declared eradicated in
1979 after a massive WHO-spearheaded campaign, and the virus samples were
placed in the U.S. and Russian laboratories.
In 1996, WHO set a target of mid-1999 for destruction of the virus. But
after U.S. and Russian resistance, it extended the deadline to the end of
this year.
China previously had called for the destruction of the stocks, claiming
their very existence presented an enormous risk to the world. But the
Chinese delegation agreed to drop the deadline, provided the research was
completed as soon as possible and a new date was set for destruction at a
later meeting of the assembly.
Although international teams carry out regular checks of the virus storage
facilities to ensure maximum security standards, there have been
long-standing fears that samples may have found their way into the hands of
nations including North Korea or Iraq.
Russian officials, however, told the assembly that the stocks in their
laboratory were completely secure and dismissed the idea that virus samples
could be stolen.
