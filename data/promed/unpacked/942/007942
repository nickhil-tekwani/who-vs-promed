Study: Antibodies to human flu viruses common in Cambodian pig
--------------------------------------------------------------
A serologic study of Cambodian pigs found for the 1st time that exposure to human influenza A is relatively common in the country's swine, researchers reported yesterday [29 May 2012] in Influenza and Other Respiratory Viruses [For the abstract, see item 2 below].

The group from Cambodia's Pasteur Institute based its findings on an analysis of 1147 blood samples obtained from pigs going through a slaughterhouse in Phnom Penh from 2006 to 2010. They noted that most Cambodian swine are raised on small farms in proximity to humans and other animal species.

So far, swine influenza viruses have never been isolated in Cambodia, and only rarely in surrounding countries. Antibodies against influenza A were detected in 14.9 percent of samples. The 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus was found after the pandemic virus reached Cambodia and was the most frequently found virus, peaking in 2010, followed by seasonal H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes, which peaked in 2008.

Researchers found that some of the pigs had been exposed to more than one human flu virus, a factor they said could lead to reassortment events that could produce new pathogenic variants.

Tests on 150 random samples found no evidence of H5N1 avian influenza exposure.

The investigators concluded that more systematic surveillance systems are needed to monitor influenza A viruses on farms rather than just slaughterhouses.

Abstract
--------
Background:
This study was conducted from 2006 to 2010 and investigated the seroprevalence of influenza A viruses in Cambodian pigs, including human H1N1, H3N2, 2009 pandemic H1N1 (A(H1N1)pdm09), and highly pathogenic avian H5N1 influenza A viruses.

Methods:
A total of 1147 sera obtained from pigs in Cambodia were tested by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assays for antibody to human influenza A viruses along with both HI and microneutralization (MN) tests to assess immunological responses to H5N1 virus. The results were compared by year, age, and province.

Results:
Antibodies against a human influenza A virus were detected in 14.9 percent of samples. A(H1N1)pdm09 virus were dominant over the study period (23.1 percent), followed by those to human H1N1 (17.3 percent) and H3N2 subtypes (9.9 percent). No pigs were serologically positive for avian H5 influenza viruses. The seroprevalence of human H1N1 and H3N2 influenza viruses peaked in 2008, while that of A(H1N1)pdm09 reached a peak in 2010. No significant differences in seroprevalence to human influenza subtypes were observed in different age groups.

Conclusions:
Cambodian pigs were exposed to human strains of influenza A viruses either prior to or during this study. The implications of these high prevalence rates imply human-to-swine influenza virus transmission in Cambodia. Although pigs are mostly raised in small non-commercial farms, our preliminary results provide evidence of sustained human influenza virus circulation in pig populations in Cambodia.

[The current observations from Cambodia, indicative of continuous circulation of human influenza A viruses in the pig population, are in line with past observations in many countries (1). They stress the human-to-pig route, causing a subclinical infection in the animals, as widely demonstrated during the recent global spread of the "pandemic H1N1 influenza virus" (pH1N1).
