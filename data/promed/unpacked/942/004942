An epidemic alert has been sounded in the state following reports of
3 fatal cases so far from suspected acute encephalitis syndrome (AES)
in several parts of the state [Manipur]. As per official surveillance
reports, more than 100 cases of suspected AES have been found mostly
in the valley districts of the state.

The patients with such syndrome have been admitted to RIMS [Regional
Institute of Medical Sciences] and some other private hospitals. The
official reports further revealed that 3 deaths were reported from
Bishnupur, Khelakhong, and Mantripukhri. All of the victims were
children below the age of one year.

Blood samples of some infected persons have already been sent to
advanced laboratory at Dibugarh (Assam) for the confirmation of
Japanese encephalitis [JE] and more blood samples would also be sent
to the National Institute of Communicable Diseases (NICD), New Delhi,
stated the source.

The official source further maintained that equipments for the
diagnosis of Japanese encephalitis have already been installed at the
JN Hospital, Porompat. However, at this crucial point of time the
equipments are malfunctioning adding more hurdles to counter the
suspected cases of acute encephalitis syndrome.

The state health services and district vector borne diseases control
societies have taken up necessary steps to counter the outbreak of
suspected AES in the state. Fogging of malathion chemical was widely
done in those areas where there are cases of such syndrome.

Imphal East district vector borne diseases control society has
already done fogging at Naorem Leikai, Uchekon Laikon, and
Mantripukhri areas. Both urban and rural areas of the state have been
widely fogged as a part of the emergency measures to counter outbreak
of Japanese encephalitis which is carried by _Culex_ mosquitoes.

As a precautionary measure, the state vector borne diseases control
society would take up mass vaccination programme for Japanese
encephalitis for children between 0-14 years of age within few months.

[Cases of what this report termed as acute encephalitis syndrome
(AES) continue in the Manipur area. It will be of interest to see if
these and earlier cases are confirmed as Japanese encephalitis virus
infections, or due to infection by some other virus(es). It is
unfortunate that the equipment is not functioning for local
laboratory diagnosis of JE virus infections. ProMED-mail awaits the
results of the laboratory tests with interest. Effectively
controlling the _Culex_ JE virus vector mosquitoes over large
geographic areas is difficult and expensive. Vaccination of the
population at risk seems to be the better approach to reducing the
number of encephalitis cases, should JE virus prove to be the
etiological agent involved.
