Cat tests positive for rabies; public health officials seek possible bite victim
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A feral cat in the Towne Lake area of Godley Station in Chatham County, Georgia, has tested positive for rabies; and Chatham County Health Department officials are seeking a man they believe may have been bitten by the cat.

At least 5 other people were exposed to the cat which was a gray and white tabby, according to a news release issued by the health department Tuesday afternoon [4 Dec 2012]. Those people have been identified. Anyone who may have been scratched or bitten by the cat is urged to call the Environmental Health Division of the Health Department.

Rabies is a potentially deadly virus that is primarily spread by infected animals. Residents should avoid contact with wild or stray animals, watch for unusual behavior in pets and wildlife, and get pets vaccinated against rabies.

Signs of rabies in animals include a change in behavior, biting, aggression, showing no fear of natural enemies (such as humans), foaming at the mouth, and paralysis.

[There is also a form of rabies commonly referred to as "dumb rabies" because animals may be very shy, and withdrawn. In early stages they may not have foam or drool at the mouth. The bottom line is to be cautious of any animal that is not acting right. Wild animals that are normally afraid of people, and suddenly are not, and domestic animals that are normally very friendly and suddenly are not. These are tips that something is not right. While there may be many reasons that an animal does not feel good and therefore does not behave in a normal fashion, rabies should be a consideration. - Mod.TG]

At least 10 people, 2 dogs exposed to rabies
--------------------------------------------
Authorities say at least 10 people and 2 dogs have been exposed to rabies after contact with a rabid cat in the Savannah, Georgia, area. The Savannah Morning News reports that animal control officers have contacted the people they know were exposed, urging them to seek medical attention.

Authorities say the cat, which hasn't been claimed by an owner and was likely a feral cat, was 1st reported to animal control officers late last month after it was acting aggressively and bit a person.

[These 2 articles, dated several days apart, are likely about the same animal. However, the number of exposures seems to have increased in the few days since the 1st article. It may be the animal has exposed other animals so this may be the beginning of an outbreak in the Savannah area.

It would be wise of them to start a rabies drive to get all the pets vaccinated. Vaccination of pets helps build a barrier between rabies and people.
