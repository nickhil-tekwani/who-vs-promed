We would be pleased to provide up-to-date information regarding the cluster
of hantavirus infection in Panama, but we cannot. All we have heard is that
there have been nine cases, four of them fatal. We presume these are all
hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) cases.
Samples from human HPS cases have been confirmed in the C.D.C. laboratories
in Atlanta and rodents are being tested there for the presence of a
hantavirus, hopefully the etiologic agent of these infections. Of interest
has been mention of _Sigmodon_ species rats (habitat from Boas del Toro
through Darien) as a focus of study. Presumably C.D.C. personnel are on
site and but it has been reported that more than 2,000 traps have been set
out and will be monitored over the next three days.
The Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO) also is currently collaborating
with health authorities in Panama. Further information might be obtained
directly from Panama Ministry of Health at <hantapanama@hotmail.com>
