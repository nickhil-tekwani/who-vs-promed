Federal officials are stepping up an investigation into the deaths of
146 harbor seals along the New England coast since September 2011
after samples of 5 of them tested positive for the influenza A virus,
authorities announced on Friday [4 Nov 2011].

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) announced
that the deaths have been declared an unusual event, enabling the
agency to pour more resources into the probe. The declaration came
after consultations with a panel of international experts established
under the Marine Mammal Protection Act to monitor and investigate sea
animal health concerns.

The 146 seals generally were less than a year old and had healthy
appearances. They were found in Maine, New Hampshire and northern
Massachusetts.

NOAA said in a statement that the deaths were more than 3 times the
average number of strandings that typically occur this time of year.

Although tissues from 5 seals examined by a New England aquarium
tested positive for the influenza A virus, test results for 6 other
viral pathogens and biotoxins were negative, the agency said [This is
about 3.4 percent of the total found dead. - Mod.TG].

"Even though preliminary results have been received, they are only
indicative of those 5 cases, and additional evaluations are underway
to determine whether the influenza virus has played a role in the
overall mortalities," the statement said.

The unexplained deaths triggered a response from NOAA's national
Marine Mammal Stranding Network, the New England Aquarium's Marine
Mammal Rescue Program and the University of New England's Marine
Animal Rescue Center.

Authorities warned the public that the seals could pose a human health
risk.

"We want to remind people to not get close to seals encountered along
the shore, to keep their pets away and to report any sightings to us
through our stranding hot line while we continue to assess whether
there is any potential human health risk," said Teri Rowles, who
coordinated the National Marine Mammal Health and Stranding Response
Program.

The harbor seal population in the Northeast is considered healthy, so
the spate of deaths doesn't signal broad trouble. The last census, in
2001, showed 99 000 harbor seals, and a survey this year [2011] is
expected to show the population has grown, said Mendy Garron, regional
marine mammal stranding coordinator for the National Marine Fisheries
Service.

The past few decades have seen some notable seal die-offs in the
Northeast, including a rash of influenza deaths around 1979 and 1980
that New England Aquarium spokesman Tony LaCasse previously said were
linked to bird flu. Scientists theorized that the seals were exposed
when they sunned themselves on rocks dotted with bird droppings, he
said.

In 2006, a morbillivirus killed hundreds of local harbor and gray
seals, Garron said. The virus killed 20 000 seals in the United
Kingdom in the early 2000s, with harbor seals accounting for 44
percent of the deaths, she said.

The 1st major reports of seal carcasses came on 28 and 29 Sep 2011,
when 11 were found on the Maine, Massachusetts and New Hampshire
coasts. Some were spotted by New Hampshire surfers.

[The â€œrash of influenza deaths around 1979 and 1980 were also
reportedly Influenza A virus in the harbor seals (_Phoca vitulina_).
At that time, the animals were reported to have had a pneumonia like
condition from which the virus was isolated. This article indicates
further testing is underway, so these seals may have had pneumonia, as
the ones mentioned earlier.

It would be nice to know if there were other lesions or isolates from
the other seals.

A review of the below listed references gives one a feel for how many
other disease seals and marine mammals are subject to that this
article does not mention. I wonder how many other pathogens will be
found among the other animals. - Mod.TG]
