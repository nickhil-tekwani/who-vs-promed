As Taiwan CDC confirms one indigenous measles case in a man, potential contacts urged to heighten vigilance and seek immediate medical attention when suspected symptoms develop
----------------------------------------------------------------------
On 5 Jan 2018, the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (Taiwan CDC) announced one new measles case in a man aged over 40 years. On [28 Dec 2017], he developed symptoms, including cough, fever, rhinitis, conjunctivitis, fatigue, and limb weakness. On [2 Jan 2018], he sought medical attention after developing rash. On [5 Jan 2018], infection with measles was confirmed in the case after the hospital reported the case to the competent authority and collected specimens from the case for laboratory testing. Currently, the case is hospitalized for treatment in isolation. Based on the case's activity and exposure history during the incubation period, it is determined that the case is an indigenous case as he had not traveled overseas.

To prevent further transmission of the disease, the local health authority has implemented a number of prevention measures and identified 230 contacts, including his family members who reside in the same household, healthcare personnel and patients that he came into contact with when he sought medical attention, to monitor and follow up until [20 Jan 2018]. During the infectious period, besides going to work and seeking medical attention, the case visited and shopped at an outlet in Linkou district, New Taipei City from 5 pm to 9 pm on [31 Dec 2017]. As measles is a highly infectious disease that is spread by contact with droplets from the nose, mouth, or throat of an infected person, either directly or through aerosol transmission, people who visited the same outlet during the aforementioned time are potential contacts and are thus urged to conduct self-health management for 18 days till [18 Jan 2017]. If suspected symptoms develop, please put on a mask immediately, seek prompt medical attention, and voluntarily notify the physician of the relevant exposure history.

According to the domestic surveillance data compiled by Taiwan CDC, last year [2017], a cumulative total of 6 measles cases were confirmed in Taiwan, including one indigenous case and 5 imported cases. During the year before last year [2016], a cumulative total of 14 measles cases were confirmed in Taiwan, including 6 indigenous cases and 8 imported cases.

According to the international epidemic surveillance data compiled by Taiwan CDC, the global measles epidemics have continued to occur. Among the neighboring countries, China, Thailand, India, and Indonesia have reported a higher number of cases and cases have continued to occur in these countries. On the other hand, in Europe, Romania has been hit the hardest by measles, while Italy, Ukraine, Germany, and Greece have all reported a higher number of cases [than in] previous years. In addition, major cities in the UK reported outbreaks during November and December 2017. Currently, Taiwan CDC has issued a travel notice of level 1: watch for measles to 14 countries, including China, Indonesia, Thailand, India, Kazakhstan, the UK, Ukraine, Greece, Romania, Italy, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Nigeria.

Measles is commoner in late winter and spring. Taiwan CDC reminds that vaccination remains the best way to prevent infection. In Taiwan, the existing routine childhood vaccination schedule recommends a dose of measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine to children 12 months of age. Unvaccinated infants and children, those who do not receive vaccine in a timely manner, and those who have never been infected with measles are high-risk groups. Parents are urged to ensure timely vaccination of children under one year old and those who have not completed the MMR vaccine series and avoid bringing unvaccinated children to the affected areas in order to prevent infection. If travel to affected areas with children at the age of 6-12 months is unavoidable, please bring the children to the local health bureau or contracted healthcare provider for one dose of MMR vaccine 2 weeks prior to the trip.

[Comment (received from a correspondent who has requested anonymity): Taiwan does not regularly see measles. Cases of measles can usually be traced to an imported case. This case being one where [the source has not been identified] is worrying, that [the country] might not be recognizing and diagnosing measles.

Greece is facing a measles epidemic this year [2017] with the number of reported cases tripling within 2 months, according to the national centre for the control and prevention of diseases (Keelpno) on [Fri 29 Dec 2017].

In late October [2017], the 1st casualty of the disease outbreak was a vaccinated Roma baby of 11 months. A total of 326 confirmed cases had been reported from the start of the year. By [28 Dec 2017], Keelpno confirmed 922 measles cases across the country.

Most cases, according to data, concerned Roma children, and people aged 25-44, who were not properly immunized against measles.

Since 2016 more than 19 000 cases have been reported across Europe, including 46 deaths of complications, experts noted.

Keelpno reiterated calls for prompt vaccination of people at risk.

In a follow-up on the "limited measles outbreak" at the Sahlgrenska University Hospital in Gothenburg, Sweden, officials reported today [2 Jan 2018] on the 12th measles case in a hospital staff member, according to a hospital news release (computer translated).

The infected employee has been staying at the Women's Clinic, East, [28-29 Dec 2017]. The hospital now contacts the patients who may be concerned, investigates their immunity and checks the need for vaccine or immunoglobulin. A Radio Sweden report notes that 54 newborns may now be at risk of contracting the virus.

"There is no reason for public concern, the number of cases is limited, but we take the situation seriously and work intensively to limit the infection," says Görel Nergelius, chief physician, Sahlgrenska University Hospital.

Since the Christmas holidays, extensive work has also been done with an immunization of all employees in the hospital -- nearly 17 000 people. Sahlgrenska University Hospital has been in staff mode since Christmas Day [25 Dec 2017] and has received additional resources for working with infection tracking, sampling, and more.

[6] UK (England): vaccine hesitancy

Measles is serious and is attacking children in Birmingham, Liverpool, and Leeds. It can have dire consequences.

Here's the awful truth about the harm bad science can do. We're in the middle of a measles epidemic among babies and young children. And why? Because of the dishonest science that connected MMR [measles, mumps, rubella vaccine], which protects against measles, to autism. It was wrong, but nonetheless scary enough to put off millions of UK parents from vaccinating their children. So we have measles-stricken babies as the disease marches across the country. And, believe me, measles is serious and is attacking children in Birmingham, Liverpool, and Leeds. It can have dire consequences.

Most people will recover from measles after around 7-10 days, but sometimes it can lead to serious complications. They include diarrhoea and vomiting, middle ear infection, eye infection, inflammation of the voice box, pneumonia , bronchitis, croup, and fits caused by a high fever. About 1 in every 15 children with measles will develop complications like these. Surely, in the face of this, parents would protect their children with am MMR vaccination?

Less common complications of measles include hepatitis, squint in the eyes, meningitis, and infection of the brain itself, encephalitis. And in rare cases measles can lead to serious eye disorders with vision loss and heart and nervous system problems. Children who are older than one year and otherwise healthy have the lowest risk of complications. But babies under 12 months, children with a poor diet or with a weakened immune system, teenagers and adults are at risk.

How would you recognise measles? Initial symptoms are literally just like a cold -- a runny nose, watery eyes, and a bit of a cough. Then a fine pink rash appears, and the baby becomes very irritable, an early sign of brain inflammation. As a rash worsens, the temperature rises. Children won't eat or drink and struggle to sleep though exhausted. Inside the baby's mouth typical patchy white spots appear, Koplik spots, a classical sign of measles.

Earlier this year [2017] the World Health Organisation (WHO) warned measles was spreading across Europe in regions where vaccination was low. To prevent outbreaks, WHO recommends that 95 per cent of the population is immunised against the infection, giving us "herd immunity" which protects all children.

Only 91.9 per cent of children were vaccinated against measles between 2015 and 2016, compared to 94.2 per cent in 2014-2015 and 94.3 per cent in 2013-2014, according to immunisation statistics released by the NHS [National Health Service]. When this happens herd immunity is lost and then every unvaccinated child becomes vulnerable. Please vaccinate your children.

[WHO declared the UK free of endemic measles in 2017, becoming one of 33 countries in Europe to have "eliminated" measles.

"Vaccinate your children" is nonetheless an important message! Not only in the UK, but globally, measles cases are increasing because the level of immunization in the population has fallen below 95 per cent. People need to be educated that the disease is more dangerous than the vaccine, and the vaccine protects the population as a whole. - Mod.LK
