A week after first learning of _E. coli_ [O157] infections across the
region, St. Louis County health department officials acknowledged Mon
31 Oct 2011, that Schnucks salad bars are a focus of the investigation
into the source of the outbreak.

An "overwhelming majority" of the 34 people ages 1-94 with reported
infections had recently eaten unspecified items from salad bars at
various Schnucks locations, said county health spokesman John
Shelton.

The Post-Dispatch first reported Thu 27 Oct 2011, that Schnucks had
voluntarily replaced some produce in its salad bars and that the
salads were a common link in some of the cases. 4 people interviewed
by the newspaper said they were diagnosed with _E. coli_ infections
and had eaten produce from salad bars at Schnucks in High Ridge,
Ladue, downtown St. Louis, and Ballwin.

Lori Willis, spokeswoman for Schnucks, acknowledged last week [28 Oct
2011] that the company's stores had voluntarily pulled some items,
including lettuce from salad bars, on the advice of their food safety
team. The company put out a news release Mon 31 Oct 2011, that stated
in part: "To date, no tests taken from Schnucks stores have come back
positive for _E. coli_ and no original source has been pinpointed, but
Schnucks Food Safety is taking every possible precaution." The company
said it was not surprising that people reported eating at Schnucks,
"the dominant salad bar operator in the St. Louis metropolitan area."

[The store's news release saying that "no tests from Schnucks stores
have come back positive" is not the same as saying that they were
negative as the tests are ongoing.

ProMED-mail awaits more information regarding this outbreak of
enterohemorrhagic pathotype of _E. coli_. - Mod.LL]
