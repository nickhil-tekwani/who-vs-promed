Deer with bovine TB purchased in Franklin County
------------------------------------------------
More cases of bovine tuberculosis (TB) have been
identified by the Indiana Board of Animal Health,
a disease outbreak that will cost some counties
money. The Indiana Board of Animal Health
announced this week [6-9 Jul 2009] that red deer
on a Harrison County cervid farm tested positive
for bovine TB. The deer were purchased from the
northern Franklin County cervid farm where the
disease was 1st found in cervids in May 2009.

Last month [June 2009], an elk on a Wayne County
hobby farm tested positive for bovine TB. That
animal also came from the Franklin County cervid farm.

Bovine TB is a chronic, infectious bacterial
disease that affects primarily cattle but can be
passed to any warm-blooded animal, including
humans. Cervid is a category of animals that
includes elk and various deer species.

USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service
(APHIS) is destroying the Franklin County cervid
herd this week, said APHIS spokesperson Cindy
Ragin. The 80-animal herd included elk and red, fallow and sika deer, she said.

The farm's owners, whose names were not released,
are eligible for payment by USDA for the
destroyed livestock, Ragin said. The payment is
based on fair market value and can't exceed USD
3000 per animal. A decision on the future of the other cervid herds is pending.

"We are awaiting a decision on the two remaining
herds, including the one in Wayne County, while
we conduct an epidemiological investigation of those herds," Ragin said.

The state Board of Animal Health (BOAH) will
conduct additional bovine TB testing of cattle in
Franklin, Union and Fayette counties estimated to
cost a total of USD 73 000. The counties are
required by law to pay for the tests. Cattle
being tested are located within a 3-mile radius
of the Franklin County cervid farm, said BOAH spokesperson Janelle Thompson.

No additional cattle testing has been ordered in
Wayne County at this time, state veterinarian Dr.
Kelly Peterson said. BOAH is continuing its
investigation of the TB-infected cervid herd in Wayne County, she said.

Franklin County received a contract from BOAH to
test 2650 cattle in 132 herds at a cost of USD 31
680, auditor Susan Jones said. Like most other
counties, Franklin had only USD 1000 in its
budget for animal testing, she said.

The commissioners agreed to put USD 31 680 in the
2010 budget for animal testing, Jones said. The
commissioners didn't sign the contract with BOAH
because it asked the county attorney to research
the law and determine if owners of infected
livestock can be held liable for the testing
costs, Jones said. The state will test 44 cattle
in 3 herds in Union County at a cost of USD 528.
Union County commissioners on Monday [6 Jul 2009]
signed a contract for the testing.

Fayette County got the biggest bill -- USD 40 800
to test 3400 cattle in 170 herds. Fayette's
commissioners questioned whether there were that
many cattle in the entire county, auditor Mary
Hiers said. The commissioners approved the
contract but decided not to include the funds in
the 2010 budget. "We'll wait until we have actual
numbers of cattle tested," Hiers said. "Then
we'll ask for an additional appropriation."

[The search and the surveillance continue. It is
no doubt a stressful time for producers of both cervids and bovines.

Bovine tuberculosis results from infection by
_Mycobacterium bovis_, a gram-positive, acid-fast
bacterium in the _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_
complex of the family Mycobacteriaceae.

Cattle are the primary hosts for _M. bovis_, but
other domesticated and wild mammals can also be
infected. Known maintenance hosts include
brush­tailed opossums (and possibly ferrets) in
New Zealand, badgers in the United Kingdom and
Ireland, bison and elk in Canada, and kudu and
African buffalo in southern Africa. White-tailed
deer in the United States (Michigan) have been
classified as maintenance hosts; however, some
authors now believe they may be spillover hosts.
Species reported to be spillover hosts include
sheep, goats, horses, pigs, dogs, cats, ferrets,
camels, llamas, many species of wild ruminants
including deer and elk; elephants, rhinoceroses,
foxes, coyotes, mink, primates, opossums, otters,
seals, sea lions, hares, raccoons, bears,
warthogs, large cats (including lions, tigers,
leopards, cheetahs and lynx) and several species
of rodents. Most mammals may be susceptible.

Little is known about the susceptibility of birds
to _M. bovis_, although they are generally
thought to be resistant. Experimental infections
have recently been reported in pigeons after oral
or intratracheal inoculation, and in crows after
intraperitoneal inoculation. Some avian species,
including mallard ducks, appear to be resistant
to experimental infection. Portions of this comment were extracted from:
