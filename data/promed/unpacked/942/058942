Child dies from botulism
-----------------------------
After 83 days of hospitalization in the ICU of the Dr. Jose Frota
Institute in Fortaleza, Ceara state, Brazil, a 10-year-old child died
of botulism. Her 12-year-old sister is still in intensive care, but
her mother was discharged after 22 days in intensive care.
According to the children's stepfather, who works as a collector of
recyclable materials such as plastic bottles, he was given a frozen
chicken pie by a person on his route. He ate it as did his wife and
her 7 daughters on 24 Sep 2006. The 2 girls began to vomit and have
diarrhea, weakness and difficulty in speaking and breathing. They
went into the ICU that same day, and the mother followed them the
next day, spending almost 22 days unconscious and on a respirator.
She still suffers from weakness.

[What is interesting in this case is that only some members of the
family became ill. If all members of the family consumed the same
dish, then it would seem likely that all should be affected. As only
some members were affected, we are left to wonder about the
difference. Was the food left over and not refrigerated promptly, or
not heated thoroughly, so that the toxin was allowed to form? Did the
affected members consume more of the product?
_Clostridium botulinum_ is an anaerobic, gram-positive, spore-forming
rod bacterium that produces a potent neurotoxin. The spores are
heat-resistant and can survive in foods that are incorrectly or
minimally processed. Seven types (A, B, C, D, E, F & G) of botulism
are recognized based on the antigenic specificity of the toxin
produced by each strain. Types A, B, E and F cause human botulism.
Types C and D cause most cases of botulism in animals. Animals most
commonly affected are wildfowl and poultry, cattle, horses and some
species of fish. Although type G has been isolated from soil in
Argentina, no outbreaks involving it have been recognized.
Foodborne botulism (as distinct from wound botulism and infant
botulism) is a severe type of food poisoning caused by the ingestion
of foods containing the potent neurotoxin formed during growth of the
organism. The toxin is heat labile and can be destroyed if heated at
80 C for 10 minutes or longer. The incidence of the disease is low,
but the disease is of considerable concern because of its high
mortality rate if not treated immediately and properly. Most of the
10 to 30 outbreaks that are reported annually in the USA are
associated with inadequately processed, home-canned foods, but
occasionally commercially produced foods have been involved in
outbreaks. Sausages, meat products, canned vegetables and seafood
products have been the most frequent vehicles for human botulism.
The organism and its spores are widely distributed in nature. They
occur in both cultivated and forest soils, bottom sediments of
streams, lakes, and coastal waters, in the intestinal tracts of fish
and mammals, and in the gills and viscera of crabs and other shellfish.
There are 4 types of botulism recognized: foodborne, infant, wound,
and a form of botulism whose classification is as yet undetermined.
Certain foods have been reported as sources of spores in cases of
infant botulism and the undetermined category; wound botulism is not
related to foods.
Foodborne botulism is the name of the disease (actually a foodborne
intoxication) caused by the consumption of foods containing the
neurotoxin produced by _C. botulinum_.
The undetermined category of botulism involves adult cases in which a
specific food or wound source cannot be identified. It has been
suggested that some cases of botulism assigned to this category might
result from intestinal colonization in adults, with in vivo
production of toxin. Reports in the medical literature suggest the
existence of a form of botulism similar to infant botulism, but
occurring in adults. In these cases, the patients had surgical
alterations of the gastrointestinal tract and/or antibiotic therapy.
It is proposed that these procedures may have altered the normal gut
flora and allowed _C. botulinum_ to colonize the intestinal tract.
The infective dose: a very small amount (a few nanograms) of toxin
can cause illness.
Onset of symptoms in foodborne botulism is usually 18 to 36 hours
after ingestion of the food containing the toxin, although cases have
varied from 4 hours to 8 days. Early signs of intoxication consist of
marked lassitude, weakness and vertigo, usually followed by double
vision and progressive difficulty in speaking and swallowing.
Difficulty in breathing, weakness of other muscles, abdominal
distention, and constipation may also be common symptoms.
The types of foods involved in botulism vary according to food
preservation and eating habits in different regions. Any food that is
conducive to outgrowth and toxin production that when processed
allows spore survival, and is not subsequently heated before
consumption, can be associated with botulism. Almost any type of food
that is not very acidic (pH above 4.6) can support growth and toxin
production by _C. botulinum_. Botulinal toxin has been demonstrated
in a considerable variety of foods, such as canned corn, peppers,
green beans, soups, beets, asparagus, mushrooms, ripe olives,
spinach, tuna fish, chicken and chicken livers and liver pate, and
luncheon meats, ham, sausage, stuffed eggplant, lobster, and smoked
and salted fish.
The incidence of the disease is low, but the mortality rate is high
if not treated immediately and properly. Some cases of botulism may
go undiagnosed because symptoms are transient or mild, or
misdiagnosed as Guillain-Barre syndrome.
Botulinum toxin causes flaccid paralysis by blocking motor nerve
terminals at the myoneural [nerve-muscle] junction. The flaccid
paralysis progresses symmetrically downward, usually starting with
the eyes and face, to the throat, chest and extremities. When the
diaphragm and chest muscles become fully involved, respiration is
inhibited and death from asphyxia results. Recommended treatment for
foodborne botulism includes early administration of botulinal
antitoxin and intensive supportive care (including mechanical
breathing assistance).
All people are believed to be susceptible to the foodborne intoxication.
Although botulism can be diagnosed by clinical symptoms alone,
differentiation from other diseases may be difficult. The most direct
and effective way to confirm the clinical diagnosis of botulism is to
demonstrate the presence of toxin in the serum or feces of the
patient or in the food which the patient consumed. Determination of
the source of an outbreak is based on detection and identification of
toxin in the food involved. The most widely accepted method is the
injection of extracts of the food into passively immunized mice
(mouse neutralization test). The test takes 48 hours. This analysis
is followed by culturing all suspect food in an enrichment medium for
the detection and isolation of the causative organism. This test takes 7 days.
