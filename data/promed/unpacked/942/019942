Taiwan has detected an asymptomatic gastrointestinal carrier of
carbapenem-resistant _Enterobacteriaceae_ with NDM-1 [New Delhi
metallo-beta-lactamase-1] in a Taiwanese cameraman who was shot in
India in September 2010. The patient, a 38-year-old male, sustained an
abdominal wound in New Delhi, India, on 19 Sep 2010 and was admitted
to Lok Nayak Jaiprakash Narayan Hospital. He received a right
hemicolectomy, and was left with 2 drains inserted. The patient was
treated with a 3rd-generation cephalosporin. On 27 Sep 2010, patient
was discharged without any signs or symptoms of infection and was
flown back to Taipei.

After his arrival in Taipei, he was admitted to an isolation room at
the Taipei Veterans General Hospital for evaluation. Bacterial culture
of patient's 2 drainage wounds, urine, and rectal swab were performed
on 27 Sep 2010. Carbapenem-resistant _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ (CRKP)
with NDM-1 confirmed by PCR and sequencing was detected in his rectal
swab on 1 Oct 2010. A repeat rectal swab was collected on 1 Oct 2010,
which was also positive for CRKP with NDM-1.

CDC [Taiwan] has informed the patient of this situation and its
implications. We have provided him with a fact sheet for a carrier of
CRKP with NDM-1 and asked him to have regular weekly follow-up
testing. After his discharge from the hospital this afternoon [4 Oct
2010], a press conference was held to explain this situation to the
public. A press release and a fact sheet in the same regard are
available on the official website of Taiwan CDC
[<http://www.cdc.gov.tw/ct.asp?xItem=30860&ctNode=960&mp=5>].

[The New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1 (NDM-1) is a an enzyme
produced by some Gram-negative bacteria that confers resistance to all
beta-lactam antibiotics, except aztreonam (a monobactam).
Nevertheless, these isolates are commonly resistant to aztreonam,
presumably by a different mechanism. NDM-1 also can co-exist with
resistance to other classes of antibiotics, including the
fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides. Colistin and tigecycline may
retain activity against NDM-1 producing bacteria, but these
antibiotics either have significant side effects, are potentially
inferior to more conventional therapies, and can be costly.

NDM-1 is encoded on a plasmid (a circular unit of DNA that replicates
within a bacterial cell independently of the chromosomal DNA).
Plasmids can easily pass between bacteria of the same or even
different species and thus spread the resistance genes. NDM-1 confers
resistance to carbapenems, a class of beta-lactam antibiotics that
include imipenem and meropenem. Carbapenem resistance in
_Enterobacteriaceae_ is not unique to NDM-1. Other mechanisms of
carbapenem-resistance are the Verona integron-encoded
metallo-beta-lactamase (VIM) carbapenemases and the _Klebsiella
pneumoniae_ carbapenemases (KPC). These carbapenemases compromise the
critical role that carbapenems have played historically as antibiotics
of last resort for therapy of many infections due to multidrug
resistant Gram-negative bacilli.

NDM-1 has been linked to receipt of medical care in India and
Pakistan. The US CDC asks that carbapenem-resistant isolates from
patients who have received medical care within 6 months in India or
Pakistan be forwarded through state public health laboratories to CDC
for further characterization
(<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/pdf/wk/mm5924.pdf>). Information on travel
for the purpose of obtaining health care abroad (medical tourism) can
be found in the CDC yellow book and is available at
<http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2010/chapter-2/medical-tourism.aspx>.

NDM-1 is detected reliably with phenotypic testing methods currently
recommended by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute
(<http://www.clsi.org/source/orders/free/m100-s20.pdf>). Infection
control interventions aimed at preventing transmission of
NDM-1-producing isolates include recognition of carbapenem-resistant
_Enterobacteriaceae_ when cultured from clinical specimens, placement
of patients colonized or infected with these isolates on contact
precautions, and in some circumstances, conducting point prevalence
surveys or active-surveillance testing among high-risk patients (CDC.
