[1] Genetic obesity risk factor
Date: Thu 19 Nov 2020

https://geneticobesitynews.com/2020/11/19/higher-covid-infection-risk-seen-in-genetic-predisposition-to-obesity-bad-cholesterol/


People who are genetically predisposed toward obesity or having high levels of so-called "bad" cholesterol -- low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol -- are at increased risk of contracting COVID-19, a study reported. The study (Causal inference for genetic obesity, cardiometabolic profile and COVID-19 susceptibility: a Mendelian randomization study) was published in the journal Frontiers in Genetics.

Recent studies have indicated that high body mass index (BMI) -- a ratio of weight to height, commonly used as a surrogate marker of obesity -- is linked with an increased risk of more serious outcomes from COVID-19 infection (for example, requiring respiratory support). However, these studies could not assess cause-and-effect relationships between obesity and COVID-19 risk.

Researchers in the UK used a technique called Mendelian randomization to better understand the causal links of COVID-19 with obesity and obesity-related conditions. Put simply, this type of analysis uses genetic markers to determine the effect of a risk factor on a given outcome, while reducing the impact of confounding variables. Using the UK Biobank, the researchers analyzed data for 1211 people who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) and 387 079 individuals who were either untested or tested negative between 16 Mar 2020 and 31 May 2020.

People with a positive test were more likely to be older, male, impoverished, and had a higher prevalence of heart and metabolic risk factors. The analysis indicated that people with genetic predisposition toward a high BMI were significantly more likely to test positive for the virus, by about 15%. Waist circumference, another common measure of obesity, was not significantly associated with a positive test risk. In addition, those with a genetic predisposition toward higher LDL cholesterol were about 58% more likely to test positive. Other obesity-related measures, namely high blood pressure and diabetes, were not significantly associated with a risk of testing positive for the new coronavirus.

"This is the 1st study to identify the causal relationships between BMI, LDL cholesterol and susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection," the researchers wrote. Subsequent analyses showed that individuals in the top 20% of genetic BMI or LDL cholesterol risk had an especially high likelihood of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2. "Our findings support the use of BMI and LDL cholesterol as important metrics alongside other known characteristics (such as age and ethnicity) in the risk assessment of vulnerability to COVID-19 infection," Nay Aung, the study's lead author with Queen Mary University of London, said in a press release.

The investigators said their study has some limitations -- most notably, the UK Biobank has relatively little data from non-European individuals, so the analysis included only Caucasians. "This is especially important due to the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on non-White individuals," the scientists wrote. "Future MR [Mendelian randomization] studies should investigate the influence of cardiometabolic risk factors on COVID-19 in populations of African and other ancestries to better inform the public health policies."

Still, these findings may help to inform public health policies. "Those who fall in the at-risk obese category or those with extreme hyperlipidemia [high fat levels] in the general population may require more rigorous social distancing or shielding," the team added.

Abstract
--------
Background: Cross-sectional observational studies have reported obesity and cardiometabolic co-morbidities as important predictors of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) hospitalization. The causal impact of these risk factors is unknown at present.

Methods: We conducted multivariable logistic regression to evaluate the observational associations between obesity traits (body mass index [BMI], waist circumference [WC]), quantitative cardiometabolic parameters (systolic blood pressure [SBP], serum glucose, serum glycated hemoglobin [HbA1c], low-density lipoprotein [LDL] cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein [HDL] cholesterol and triglycerides [TG]) and SARS-CoV-2 positivity in the UK Biobank cohort. One-sample MR [Mendelian randomization] was performed by using the genetic risk scores of obesity and cardiometabolic traits constructed from independent datasets and the genotype and phenotype data from the UK Biobank. Two-sample MR was performed using the summary statistics from COVID-19 host genetics initiative. Cox proportional hazard models were fitted to assess the risk conferred by different genetic quintiles of causative exposure traits.

Results: The study comprised 1211 European participants who were tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and 387 079 participants who were either untested or tested negative between 16 Mar 2020 and 31 May 2020. Observationally, higher BMI, WC, HbA1c and lower HDL cholesterol were associated with higher odds of COVID-19 infection. One-sample MR analyses found causal associations between higher genetically determined BMI and LDL cholesterol and increased risk of COVID-19 (odds ratio [OR]: 1.15, confidence interval [CI]: 1.05-1.26 and OR: 1.58, CI: 1.21-2.06, per 1 standard deviation increment in BMI and LDL cholesterol, respectively). Two-sample MR produced concordant results. Cox models indicated that individuals in the higher genetic risk score quintiles of BMI and LDL were more predisposed to COVID-19 (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.24, CI: 1.03-1.49 and HR: 1.37, CI: 1.14-1.65, for the top vs the bottom quintile for BMI and LDL cholesterol, respectively).

Conclusion: We identified causal associations between BMI, LDL cholesterol and susceptibility to COVID-19. In particular, individuals in higher genetic risk categories were predisposed to SARS-CoV-2 infection. These findings support the integration of BMI into the risk assessment of COVID-19 and allude to a potential role of lipid modification in the prevention and treatment.

---
Study participants with positive tests, while all of European descent, also were more likely to be "older, male, more deprived with a higher prevalence of cardiometabolic risk factors and comorbidities".

While in observational studies, there was an association between a higher BMI and WC (waist circumference) and a higher odds of SARS-CoV-2 positivity (OR: 1.13 [CI: 1.07-1.20], OR: 1.15 [CI: 1.08-1.23], the 1-sample MR analyses, while indicating a causal relationship between higher BMI and increased odds of positive test (OR: 1.15 [CI: 1.05-1.26]), WC was not associated with COVID-19 status. This association was confirmed with 2-sample MR. The studies also identified a causal relationship between LDL cholesterol and COVID-19 positivity.

A key reminder is the racial and ethnic homogeneity of the study group and the need to see if these results are reproducible in other groups, albeit the results are putting statistical confirmation on associations that have been observed during the course of the pandemic, clearly identifying high-risk groups for intervention with prevention measures. - Mod.MPP]

[2] WHO statement: Remdesivir

https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail/who-recommends-against-the-use-of-remdesivir-in-covid-19-patients


WHO has issued a conditional recommendation* against the use of remdesivir in hospitalized patients, regardless of disease severity, as there is currently no evidence that remdesivir improves survival and other outcomes in these patients. This recommendation, released on 20 Nov 2020, is part of a living guideline on clinical care for COVID-19. It was developed by an international guideline development group, which includes 28 clinical care experts, 4 patient-partners and one ethicist.

The guidelines were developed in collaboration with the non-profit Magic Evidence Ecosystem Foundation (MAGIC), which provided methodologic support. The guidelines are an innovation, matching scientific standards with the speed required to respond to an ongoing pandemic. Work on this began on 15 Oct 2020 when the WHO Solidarity Trial published its interim results. Data reviewed by the panel included results from this trial, as well as 3 other randomized controlled trials. In all, data from over 7000 patients across the 4 trials were considered. The evidence suggested no important effect on mortality, need for mechanical ventilation, time to clinical improvement, and other patient-important outcomes.

The guideline development group recognized that more research is needed, especially to provide higher certainty of evidence for specific groups of patients. They supported continued enrollment in trials evaluating remdesivir.

*A conditional recommendation is issued when the evidence around the benefits and risks of an intervention are less certain. In this case, there is a conditional recommendation against the use of remdesivir. This means that there isn't enough evidence to support its use.

[Beigel and colleagues (1) concluded that remdesivir "was superior to placebo in shortening the time to recovery in adults who were hospitalized with COVID-19 and had evidence of lower respiratory tract infection." Their data presentation showed Kaplan-Meier estimates of mortality were 6.7% with remdesivir and 11.9% with placebo by day 15 and 11.4% with remdesivir and 15.2% with placebo by day 29 (hazard ratio, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.52-1.03). Serious adverse events were reported in 131 of the 532 patients who received remdesivir (24.6%) and in 163 of the 516 patients who received placebo (31.6%).

Spinner and colleagues (2) concluded: "Among patients with moderate COVID-19, those randomized to a 10-day course of remdesivir did not have a statistically significant difference in clinical status compared with standard care at 11 days after initiation of treatment. Patients randomized to a 5-day course of remdesivir had a statistically significant difference in clinical status compared with standard care, but the difference was of uncertain clinical importance."

Interestingly, on Thursday (19 Nov 2020) the USA's Food and Drug Administration gave emergency use authorization for the combination of baricitinib and remdesivir (https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-authorizes-drug-combination-treatment-covid-19), stating "In a clinical trial of hospitalized patients with COVID-19, baricitinib, in combination with remdesivir, was shown to reduce time to recovery within 29 days after initiating treatment compared to patients who received a placebo with remdesivir."

COVID-19 has substantially impacted the Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR), home to nearly 700 million people across 22 diverse countries. Since the 1st reported confirmed case in January 2020, 3 611 352 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 91 738 deaths were reported in the region as of 17 Nov 2020 (1; see source URL for complete references). Most countries saw fairly slow transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) during the early months of the pandemic, but in May [2020], as social measures, such as restrictions and partial or full lockdowns, were relaxed during the holy month of Ramadan, disease transmission accelerated (2,3). After a small reduction in the summer, cases increased in late August [2020] as disease surged in countries, such as Jordan and Tunisia, where transmission had been low earlier in the year, and resurged in other countries, such as Bahrain and Oman (3).

Several factors can explain the regional COVID-19 trends and inform more effective disease control. First, the early implementation of public health and social measures, starting mid-March [2020], proved effective, including non-pharmaceutical individual and societal interventions to control COVID-19 (4). All countries closed schools and non-essential businesses, imposed travel restrictions, and partial or full lockdowns (5), and community mobility decreased substantially (6). But as these measures were eased, community mobility resumed and was only 19% below pre-COVID-19 levels by mid-July [2020] (6). Second, restrictions on mass gatherings and pilgrimages had an important role. In Iran, cases initially occurred in Qom, a destination for religious pilgrimages, which soon became an epicentre, and within 15 days all 31 provinces in Iran reported cases. By early April [2020], 12 EMR countries reported SARS-CoV-2 transmission associated with mass gatherings and pilgrimages. In response, new measures were taken, including the closures of mosques and the suspension of Friday and church prayers and the Umrah (7). Third, migrant workers drove SARS-CoV-2 transmission during the early months of the pandemic in those countries where they constitute a large proportion of the population. The Gulf countries, which have the highest testing rates, also have the highest COVID-19 regional attack rates; in these countries, 62-90% of COVID-19 cases occurred among migrant workers early on (8), attributed partly to overcrowded living conditions (9). Finally, among the 8 EMR countries affected by conflict and humanitarian emergencies -- Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, the occupied Palestinian territory, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen -- COVID-19 attack rates are substantially lower than in other countries in the region (median 73 cases per 100 000 population vs 1343 cases per 100 000) (10). This lower attack rate might be due to restricted international arrivals limiting virus introduction, reduced internal mobility, the demographics of these countries (1), and fewer tests in conflict-affected countries than in other EMR countries (median 291 tests per 100 000 vs 15 279 per 100 000) (12). Observations from community and health facilities in conflict-affected countries suggest that laboratory testing capacity or under-reporting of cases is unlikely to solely explain these lower attack rates.

The main challenges to the COVID-19 response in the EMR include information sharing, expanding public health measures, protecting health workers, achieving behaviour change, ensuring continuity of essential health services, and establishing reliable supply chains. Although the effectiveness of country-specific COVID-19 responses varies, certain best practices in the region have been important. Decisive leadership and whole-of-government and whole-of-society approaches are central to an effective response (13). Most countries established high-level national multisectoral coordination mechanisms and developed national plans that covered the 9 pillars of the WHO COVID-19 Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan (panel) (14). For surveillance, countries leveraged existing systems, including routine influenza surveillance and polio infrastructure. Nonetheless, reporting of epidemiological data to WHO as per the International Health Regulations (2005) and application of the WHO case definition have often been unreliable and incomplete. Although all 22 countries can test for SARS-CoV-2, laboratory capacities, testing strategies, and testing rates vary widely -- for example, from 33 to 146 343 tests per 100 000 population in EMR countries. Contact tracing is generally insufficient and not yet scaled up. All EMR countries have designated health facilities to manage COVID-19 cases, mostly of severe disease. Treatment protocols vary from supportive treatment to complex regimens, including compassionate drug use outside of clinical trials (15). Health workers accounted for 7-10% of COVID-19 cases during the 3 months of the pandemic in the EMR, and outbreaks among these workers contributed to acceleration of the pandemic (16). Inadequate infection prevention and control (IPC) programmes and poor IPC compliance are important contributing factors, especially considering that 10 countries had no pre-existing national IPC structures. On the basis of WHO recommendations, all EMR countries subsequently prioritised and invested more in IPC practices through training, monitoring, and provision of personal protective equipment (17). As the pandemic evolved, risk communications and community engagement faced challenges, such as widespread so-called pandemic fatigue (18). COVID-19 knowledge and risk perception vary across the region; use of masks ranges from 6% to 83% across EMR countries (19-21). The socioeconomic impacts of COVID-19 response measures have been substantial, with gross domestic product projected to decline by 4.7% across the EMR in 2020 and by 13% in conflict-affected countries (22). WHO recommends risk assessment before the easing of COVID-19 response measures, but some countries struggled to make such assessments while mitigating economic impacts, and often decisions were not adequately informed by public health data (23).

The COVID-19 pandemic has compromised delivery of essential health services (EHS) in the region, as countries repurposed health systems to respond. About 75% of EHS had some level of disruption in 13 countries, mostly affecting routine immunisations, dental services, rehabilitation services, and family planning (24). Countries are now increasingly prioritising continuity of EHS, using WHO's operational guidance (25). In addition, the pandemic has exposed the fragility of the medical supply chain; there have been shortages of personal protective equipment, ventilators, and diagnostics in all EMR countries. WHO and partners established the COVID-19 Supply Chain System that managed distribution of supplies to more than 160 countries. WHO's EMR logistics hub in Dubai, central to this system, had managed 376 shipments to 109 countries by 17 Nov 2020. In conflict-affected countries, there are insufficient resources for an effective response, with inadequate planning, limited public health and hospital capacity, and difficulties with implementing physical distancing and hand and personal hygiene in overcrowded settlements for displaced persons (26).

The most pressing challenges remain balancing the easing of COVID-19 control measures while maintaining suppression of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, scaling up public health measures, tackling COVID-19 fatigue, and establishing a platform for distribution of eventual COVID-19 vaccines. Countries in the EMR must heed the advice of the independent Global Preparedness Monitoring Board: show responsible leadership, engage citizens, build strong systems for health security, and ensure sustained investment and strong governance of preparedness for health emergencies (27).

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 218 (Samoa has not been added as yet).

Data by country, area, or territory for 20 Nov 2020 can be accessed at https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/WHO%20daily%20tablesNov20_1605920894.pdf.

- The Americas region reported 37.9% of daily case numbers and 37.0% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, but maintained its position as the most severely affected region, having reported more than 24.0 million cases. The USA continues to dominate, followed by Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, Canada, Mexico, and Peru. Other countries reporting more than 1000 cases include Chile, Costa Rica, Panama, and the Dominican Republic. And countries/territories reporting more than 500 cases but fewer than 1000 in the past 24 hours include Ecuador, Paraguay, Guatemala, and Puerto Rico.

- The European region reported 45.0% of daily case numbers and 46.1% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, and total cumulative cases reported exceed 16.3 million. Countries not reporting cases today (20 Nov 2020) include Israel and Kazakhstan, among others. Countries reporting more than 10 000 cases in the past 24 hours include Italy, Russia, Poland, Germany, UK, France, Ukraine, and Romania. There are 23 additional countries reporting more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours.

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 5.7% of daily case numbers and 7.4% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 3.7 million cases. Iran is dominant, with continuing record-breaking highs, followed by Jordan, Morocco, Pakistan, Iraq, Lebanon, Palestinian Authority, and the UAE. Libya reported more than 500 cases but fewer than 1000, while Tunisia, Sudan, Djibouti, Yemen, and Somalia have not reported any cases in the past 24 hours.

- The African region reported 1.3% of daily case numbers and 1.6% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours and has reported more than 1.43 million cases. South Africa maintains its dominance, followed by Kenya, Algeria, Cameroon, Ethiopia, Botswana, Uganda, Angola, Ghana, Nigeria, and Mali.

- The Western Pacific region reported 0.92% of daily case numbers and 0.67% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of 0.82 million cases. Japan is dominant, followed by Philippines, Malaysia, South Korea, Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, Mongolia, and China.

- The South East Asia region reported 9.2% of the daily newly reported cases and 7.2% of reported deaths in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 10.2 million cases. As previously, India remains dominant, followed by Indonesia, Bangladesh, Nepal, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, and the Maldives.

Impression: Basically unchanged on the regional levels with the continued dominance of Europe and the Americas region representing over 80% of both newly confirmed cases and newly reported deaths in the past 24 hours. At the country level, the Philippines has been overtaken by Japan as the dominant country in the Western Pacific region; Italy maintains dominance in the European region, although France has the highest cumulative case count. The USA maintains its position as the country reporting the most cases on a daily basis.

[In the past 24 hours, the USA (204 014), India (46 288), Italy (37 239), and Brazil (37 075) have reported the highest numbers of cases. A global total of 12 078 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (19-20 Nov 2020).

Countries reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours (12 countries) include the USA, India, Italy, Brazil, Russia (24 318), Germany (23 450), France (22 882), Poland (22 464), UK (20 252), Spain (15 156), Ukraine (14 575), and Iran (13 260). A total of 62 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 33 of the 62 countries reporting more than 1000 newly confirmed cases are from the European region, 10 are from the Americas region, 10 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 5 are from the South East Asia region, 2 are from the Western Pacific region, and 2 are from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have increased by 2.0%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 12.9%. Looking at the same comparisons in the USA (which reported 30.3% of all newly reported cases in the past 24 hours -- over 200 000), as the dominant country worldwide with clearly uncontrolled transmission, the 7-day change in daily reported cases is 20.3% and in reported deaths is 33.1%. In Italy, the dominant country in the European region, the 7-day change in daily reported cases is decreased by 2.5%, and but reported deaths have increased by 26.5%. And in Iran, the dominant country in the Eastern Mediterranean region, the 7-day change in daily reported cases is 20.9% and in reported deaths is 4.3%.

Impression: The global daily reported cases continue to increase with almost 700 000 newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours. Countries in the European and the Americas regions are still showing the largest increases in daily new case counts, followed by the Eastern Mediterranean and the South East Asia regions. The USA continues to show uncontrolled transmission. - Mod.MPP]
