[There is an interesting dichotomy between the vaccination numbers provided
and the observations on owner priorities. In previous years El Salvador has
only officially reported equine anthrax, though it is clear that other
stock will have been affected. The disease risk cannot be maintained by
occasional equine cases. - Mod.MHJ
