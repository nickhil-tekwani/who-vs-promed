Fatal delay over foot and mouth
----------------------------------------------
[It is claimed that Ministers and officials at first ignored independent
epidemiologists who offered their help shortly after the outbreak was
announced and who could have warned that the initial policy was allowing
the disease to spiral out of control. The serious shortcomings in the
ministry's handling of foot and mouth almost certainly played a significant
role in the outbreak developing into a national crisis. The decision to
play down the advice of the scientists went directly against the report of
the inquiry into the 1967-68 outbreak which said epidemiologists had to be
on standby to study the outbreak "from the start".
The Government also ignored an Army report into the 1967-68 crisis which
warned that even in the event of a small outbreak, the Army should be
brought in immediately "to ensure it did not develop into a major problem".
The report, unearthed by The Telegraph in the Public Record Office, said
Maff was simply incapable of masterminding an operation to control the
spread of the disease. It criticized the use of veterinary surgeons to
organize the operation, a key feature of the current outbreak. By the time
the Army was first called in, 12 days into the 1967 crisis, "there was
already a large backlog of carcasses awaiting destruction, and of farms
awaiting disinfection" and Maff was unable to cope. Once the Army were
called in to assist there was a rapid improvement in the control and
organization of all facilities. "It became possible to establish a proper
system of operational control." It concluded: "In a national emergency of
this nature, the earlier the military can be called in the better." Maff
agreed at the time that the Army should be called in immediately in the
event of any future occurrence of the disease, but it was not until a month
into the current outbreak that the troops were called in.
The external scientists, from Imperial College and Edinburgh University,
were only called in on 6 Mar [2001 -- 2 weeks after the epidemic began. It
was not until a month after the start of the outbreak that the Government
acted on their advice to speed up the cull. By 16 Mar [2001, Jim
Scudamore, Chief Veterinary Officer, was being told by the external
epidemiologists and Maff's own scientists that the disease was out of control.
Despite clear indications that current control measures were not working --
because of an average delay of 3 or so days between diagnosis and slaughter
-- there was no explicit move to cut the time to slaughter. A Maff
spokesman said this was consistent with what was known at the time, though
he admitted they could not cope with the demands of slaughter.
The Edinburgh and Imperial teams predicted that the delays would mean a
doubling of the epidemic every 8 or so days. It was not until 23 Mar
[2001, a week after the initial warning, that Prof David King, the
Government's chief scientist, warned that drastic action was necessary to
reduce the delay. This would suggest that the initial failure to react
doubled the size of the epidemic. One of the scientists involved commented
that the information provided that day "was not news to them [Maff".
Because of lack of resources, "they just did not think they could do
anything about it". There was a "defeatist attitude", despite the knowledge
by many in the ministry that the battle against the disease was being lost.
The realization that more had to be done had to wait until a joint meeting
between Maff and the Food Standards Agency on 21 Mar [2001. At the
meeting, teams at Imperial College, London, Cambridge and Edinburgh
universities and the Government's Veterinary Laboratories Agency gave
firmer predictions. Notable among these was that as many as 400 cases would
be reported per day by the end of June, requiring the slaughter of half of
Britain's livestock, unless firmer controls were put in place. It was
publicly admitted that the disease was out of control in a statement
released by Maff on 23 Mar.
But it was Prof King who, when he heard the dire predictions at the
meeting, "ran with them", calling for firm time-to-slaughter policies, said
one of those present. It was only then that Tony Blair appreciated the
seriousness of the epidemic. Before flying to Stockholm for an EU summit on
the evening of 22 Mar, he visited the worst hit area of Cumbria. The Prime
Minister was shocked by the scale of the slaughter and by the report from
the epidemiologists, which he read on the flight. He then decided to take
personal control of the Government's efforts to control the epidemic and
order a major upgrading of the Army's role.

Ministers deny "series of errors" [edited
-----------------------------------------------
Ministers yesterday rejected claims that they had made a series of serious
errors in their handling of the foot and mouth crisis. As the Tories said
the Army should have been brought in sooner, Joyce Quin, an agriculture
minister, dismissed allegations that Government delays had led to a
near-doubling in the extent of the epidemic.
Speaking on Radio 4's Today programme, Ms Quin said the Army was not
sidelined during the early days of the outbreak. "There was contact between
ministers in Maff and the Ministry of Defence on 20 Feb 2001, the day the
outbreak was first suspected, in order to say 'We may have a serious
outbreak and we will need to work together'." Ms Quin said: "In this
report, it says that there were quite clearly teething troubles during the
initial deployment of the Armed Forces in 1967. I believe that a lot of
these troubles were avoided this time in the preparation that took place
for Army deployment."
Ms Quin said the Government needed to adopt a different approach because
the outbreak this year was not the same. "In the 1967 outbreak, an
absolutely crucial difference is that the farm reported the disease and it
was identified within 4 days. That was not the case this time around where,
when we traced back to the source farm, it was evident that infection had
been there for at least 2 weeks, possibly longer, and in that time, unlike
1967, the disease had entered sheep and one million movements of sheep had
taken place. Therefore we were dealing with something that was very
different. As all the tracings took place of movements, and we could see
the scale of the problem, we brought the Army in."
Ms Quin rejected suggestions that the Government had ignored the advice of
the main report into outbreak of 1967, which said that epidemiologists
should be put on stand-by "from the start, predicting its probable
development and so providing information that would help in formulating
measures to deal with it". Ms Quin said: "Epidemiologists need some
statistics to go on and therefore they cannot begin work on day one of an
outbreak. Epidemiologists were brought in as soon as there were some
statistics."

[Following our joint research in 1968-70, LP Smith set up a system for
collaboration in the field between the Meteorological Office and MAFF in
the event of any future FMD outbreak, essentially to predict future and
undiscovered existing outbreaks. This was tested in various MAFF wargames
and actually used in the SVD outbreak, and found to work successfully. It
necessitated only paper & pencil; see 1970 WMO technical Note #113, pp 7-9
& 19-27. Since that time various successful computer models have been
developed -- Gloster's was the first -- and tested, and their results
published. Ms Quin's comment about epidemiologists only able to come late
to FMD outbreaks is not fully informed. They have an important place on the
first day. - Mod.MHJ

Government was warned of epidemic risks last year
----------------------------------------------------------------
The chief veterinary officer was warned last year that immediate slaughter
could cut the impact of a foot and mouth epidemic by more than half. The
ministry also ignored warnings from its own epidemiologist, Prof John
Wilesmith, who was said to be demoralised by the inability of the ministry
to deploy sufficient resources to slaughter animals immediately after
diagnosis of disease.
An internet search yesterday showed that a clear warning was given by
epidemiologists in the October edition of the journal Research in
Veterinary Science. The article by a leading team of epidemiologists who
have since moved from Oxford University to Imperial College, London, was
titled "The Importance Of Immediate Destruction In Epidemics Of Foot And
Mouth Disease." It warned of "serious economic consequences". The team
studied the October 1967 outbreak in Britain and an epidemic in Taiwan in
1997. Using computer simulations, Dr Sally Howard and Dr Christl Donnelly
were able to predict what would have happened if animals in those outbreaks
had all been slaughtered on the day they were diagnosed.
In the 1967 epidemic, the majority of herds were slaughtered on the same
day, but in a small number of cases it took up to 3 days -- the average
delay in the latest epidemic until recently. Had all herds been slaughtered
immediately in 1967, the team concluded that the number of herds infected
in the first 100 days could have been cut from 2127 to 1539.
The Taiwan epidemic is similar to the latest British outbreak. It was
spread rapidly by the movement of animals, and the speed with which it was
stamped out could not compete with new outbreaks, creating long delays in
slaughter and disposal of carcasses. However, the epidemic was confined to
pigs, which breathe out significantly more virus than other animals, and
vaccination was used. Over a month, there were outbreaks in 4385 herds. But
if same-day destruction had been used, the figure would have been cut to
1621 herds. The report said: "Had it been possible to implement this
policy, the epidemic could have been brought under control much sooner and
would have resulted in fewer than half the infected herds ever having been
infected."
The concluding line of the report is chillingly relevant: "The prompt
destruction of infected herds is a well-recognized objective, and whilst
limitations on resources may make it difficult, this work demonstrates the
very high priority that must be given to this control measure."
A Maff spokesman said yesterday: "It has always been known that it is
important to slaughter as quickly as possible. What we have tried to do is
to achieve that."

[It is always nice when a team of young scientists confirm the veracity of
what one had written 30 years earlier; see Hugh-Jones & Wright, J. Hygiene
(1970) 68:253-271. If they had asked, it would have been possible to
provide Howard & Donnelly with full individual herd data for the 1967-68
epidemic instead of depending on HMSO summary data. Maybe someone will also
have the foresight this time to archive the data from this epidemic for
studies in 30 years time. - Mod.MHJ
