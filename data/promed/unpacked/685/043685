Alfalfa sprouts bear high _Salmonella_ risk, researchers report
Food poisoning outbreaks in the United States and Europe show alfalfa
sprouts are an inherent and high-risk source of _Salmonella_ infections,
researchers said in a report published Tuesday. "Until barriers to a
pathogen-free seed are resolved we conclude that alfalfa sprouts are a
high-risk food for salmonellosis. All consumers, particularly those at
greatest risk for severe disease (immunosuppressed, elderly and very young
people) should consider this danger when deciding whether to eat alfalfa
sprouts," the report said.
"The fundamental problem is that the (commercial) sprouting process
contains no 'kill step' that would eliminate pathogens without compromising
a seed's germination potential," said the study from the State of Oregon
Health Division and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The
authors of the study speculated that _Salmonella_ organisms reside in seed
crevices between the cotyledon and testa, an area that chemical treatments
do not penetrate. Seeds are often stored for months or years under cool,
dry conditions in which _Salmonella_ bacteria are stable. During the three
to five-day sprouting period the bacteria can increase in number three to
four times, the report said.
"From farm to table, many opportunities exist for contamination of alfalfa
seeds or sprouts. Crops can be easily contaminated with dirty water, runoff
form adjacent farms, animal fertilisers used in previous growing seasons or
droppings from rodents or ruminants," it added. The study, published in
this week's Journal of the American Medical Association, was based on a
look at alfalfa sprout salmonella outbreaks in 1995-96 in Oregon and
British Columbia, and a similar incident in Denmark in 1995.
In North America, the report said, more than 20,000 people contracted
_Salmonella_ infections from alfalfa sprouts in 1995. _Salmonella_
infections typically cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, stomach pain and,
in severe cases, muscle paralysis, shock and collapse.
