A man contracted and recovered from hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, a
rare and potentially fatal pneumonia-like virus carried by rodents,
the state health department said Tuesday [24 Jul 2007].
The unidentified 40-year-old man worked at a Boy Scout camp in
Clearfield County. He was hospitalized after falling ill earlier this
month [July 2007] but has since been discharged, said department
spokesman Dan Miller.
The camp has since cleaned rodent droppings in buildings, put in
traps and poison bait to reduce rodent populations, and sealed
openings to prevent rodents from entering, the health department
said. Because the camp took immediate steps to avoid further
exposures, it was allowed to remain open, officials said.
Hantavirus was 1st identified in the United States during a 1993
outbreak in the Four Corners area of New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado
and Utah. Most cases still occur in western states, and human
infection is very rare in the eastern U.S., according to the
Pennsylvania health department.
The syndrome begins with fever, muscle aches, nausea and vomiting and
can lead to respiratory failure and shock. Although there is no
specific treatment, early diagnosis is important for recovery.
In the past decade, only 3 previous cases were diagnosed in
Pennsylvania residents, including 2 who died, according to the health
department.

It would be of interest to know which of the 4 hantaviruses found in
the USA was the etiological agent in this case. Both Sin Nombre
hantavirus and New York hantavirus have caused human disease and are
the ones most likely to be involved in human infections in Pennsylvania.
