The bacterium that causes strangles in horses was behind a dangerous brain infection in a man in Belgium, doctors report. The man was diagnosed with meningoencephalitis -- a serious neurological condition resembling both meningitis and encephalitis, with inflammation of both the brain tissue and its covering membrane. The bacterium behind the infection was identified as _Streptococcus equi_ subspecies _equi_.

The 69-year-old Caucasian was admitted to the emergency department of Antwerp University Hospital after returning from a one-month vacation to Myanmar that included horseback riding. The patient's medical history included gout, food poisoning, and neurosurgical reconstruction of the skull after a fracture suffered 5 years earlier as a result of a fall from a horse.

For the preceding few days, the patient had been increasingly tired and drowsy, with complaints of a headache, left-sided ear pain, and night sweats. The day before admission the patient had become increasingly confused. On the day of admission, he was found by his wife lying on the floor of his home, confused, agitated, shivering, and lacking bladder control.

On admission, his temperature was elevated and his heart rate was 111 beats per minute, Jeroen Kerstens and his colleagues reported in the journal, Case Reports in Neurological Medicine. Diagnostic work included blood tests, a chest x-ray and a CT scan of the brain. Bacterial meningitis was suspected, and after obtaining 2 sets of blood cultures, intravenous antibiotics were given.

Shortly after starting the antibiotic therapy, the patient became more drowsy and developed left-sided paralysis, left-sided central facial palsy, and right-sided head and eye deviation. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit and was intubated and ventilated the next day because of increasing difficulties with breathing. Cerebrospinal fluid cultures were positive for _Streptococcus equi_.

Intravenous antibiotics were continued for 21 days. Four days after treatment began, the patient was weaned from the ventilator and extubated. Initially, the patient remained very agitated and disoriented. Nine days after admission to intensive care, the patient was transferred to the neurology department. Later, the _Streptococcus equi_ was identified as _S. equi_ subspecies _equi_ by an outside agency.

The patient initially recovered completely. He had no complaints apart from mild gait disturbances and light-headedness at a follow-up appointment 3â€‰months after discharge. One month later, the patient was readmitted with intracranial bleeding, and CT scans showed multiple areas of bleeding on the right side of the brain. More imaging confirmed the presence of a suspected superficial dural arteriovenous fistula, which was dealt with by a neurosurgeon. He was subsequently discharged home.

Discussing the circumstances of the case, the doctors said they had been able to find only 3 other cases in the scientific literature in which _S. equi_ subspecies _equi_ had infected the central nervous system in humans. "In these cases, direct contact with horses could be pinpointed." The 1st case, published in 2003, involved a 13-year-old Canadian boy who lived on a horse farm. He presented with a 2-day history of fever, increasing neck stiffness, headache, poor appetite, nausea, vomiting, lethargy, light sensitivity, deafness, and poor coordination. He was diagnosed with bacterial meningitis and went on to develop hydrocephalus. He recovered with only mild problems with coordination, but his hearing did not recover and he received a cochlear implant.

The 2nd case involved a 75-year-old woman admitted with fever and stupor who was successfully treated with 10 days of intravenous antibiotics. She later stated that her neighbours were horse owners and she had visited their farm within 2 weeks of admission.

Very recently, a 13-year-old-boy with systemic lupus presented with sepsis and meningitis after contact with a sick pony. Although he recovered fully after 8 weeks of antibiotics, the case was complicated by subdural pus requiring neurosurgical evacuation.

"In our patient, recent contact with infected horses in Myanmar was presumably the cause of the disease, and prior surgery was a possible route of entry," they said. "In summary," they continued, "we report a rare case of _S. equi_ subsp. _equi_ meningoencephalitis that initially recovered well after treatment with antibiotics and glucocorticoids." The cerebral lesions seen on an MRI not only caused meningitis but also meningoencephalitis, and the postinfectious dural fistula accompanied by brain bleeding illustrated the aggressive nature of the toxins released by this bacterium, with a further inflammatory reaction.

Abstract
--------
"Invasive infection with Lancefield group C streptococci in humans is extremely rare, with the vast majority of clinical isolates belonging to _Streptococcus dysgalactiae_ subsp. _equisimilis_. We report a case of meningoencephalitis in a 69-year-old man caused by _Streptococcus equi_ subsp. _equi_, a microbe that causes strangles in _Equus caballus_ (i.e., the horse). This is only the 4th infection with this subtype of the central nervous system (CNS) reported in humans. The invasiveness of these bacteria, known to be capable of releasing strongly immunogenic exotoxins, is illustrated by white matter lesions that are present in the acute phase. This patient initially recovered well after treatment with antibiotics and glucocorticoids. However, the patient was readmitted 5 months later with multiple intraparenchymatous cerebral haemorrhages. Cerebral angiography confirmed the presence of a suspected superficial dural arteriovenous fistula (DAVF), which is seldom reported after CNS infection. The invasiveness of these bacteria was illustrated by white matter lesions present in the acute phase and the occurrence of a de novo dural arteriovenous fistula in the follow-up period."

_Streptococcus equi_ subsp. _equi_ is a Lancefield group C, beta-hemolytic streptococcus. Beta hemolysis is complete lysis of red cells around the bacterial colony of the organism, growing on blood agar medium. Lancefield grouping is a classification system based on the antigenic specificity of carbohydrates present on the bacterial cell wall. Group C streptococci share many virulence factors with group A streptococci (_Streptococcus pyogenes_) and cause similar diseases, e.g., pharyngitis, meningitis, and endocarditis (https://www.hindawi.com/journals/cjidmm/2017/9509604/).

Lancefield group C streptococci include _Streptococcus dysgalactiae subspecies _equisimilis_ (_S. equisimilis_), _Streptococcus equi_ subsp. equi (S. equi), and _Streptococcus equi_ subsp. _zooepidemicus_ (_S. zooepidemicus_). _S. equi_ causes strangles, a highly contagious upper respiratory tract infection in horses. _S. zooepidemicus_ causes infections in several species of mammals, including cattle and horses. Both _S. zooepidemicus_ and _S. equi_ cause zoonotic infections. Whenever group C streptococci are recovered from infected people, speciation should be considered for appropriate epidemiologic investigation because identification of the pathogen as _S. zooepidemicus_ or _S. equi_ would imply a zoonotic origin.

The patient in the case report above presented with bacterial meningitis due to _S. equi_, consistent with his recent history of close, one-month contact with horses in Myanmar. He had a past history of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage complicating a basilar skull fracture 5 years previously; a CSF leak, if recurrent, can create a pathway for _S. equi_ in the upper respiratory tract to enter the CSF and increase the risk of meningitis. He had also complained of recent left-sided ear pain, which would suggest acute middle ear infection (otitis media) or mastoiditis as a possible precipitating cause of bacterial meningitis; in fact, imaging studies showed opacification of the left mastoid. On admission, Gram stain of the CSF showed "irregularly shaped cocci" and both blood and CSF cultures were positive for _Streptococcus equi_. Shortly after starting antibiotic therapy, the patient developed left-sided hemiplegia, which if due to an ischemic stroke, would suggest the possibility of septic emboli from underlying endocarditis. - Mod.ML
