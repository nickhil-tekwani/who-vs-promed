Uganda says Ebola outbreak death toll rises to 48
-------------------------------------------------
The death toll from an Ebola outbreak in Uganda has risen to 48, with 131 confirmed cases, a health official involved in managing the outbreak said on Thursday [3 Nov 2022].

Last week Uganda's health minister put the death toll at 30, with 109 confirmed cases.

"Confirmed cases by today [3 Nov 2022] 131 and 48 deaths," Henry Kyobe Bosa, Ebola incident commander at Uganda's health ministry, told a briefing organised by the World Health Organization's Africa office.

"On the spread and when we are likely to have the outbreak ending I see no experts on this panel can actually predict when it will end," he said, adding authorities were using measures like contact-tracing, risk communication, and appropriate treatment and burials to control the outbreak.

Last month [October 2022] the government said it was optimistic the Ebola outbreak could be wiped out by the end of the year [2022].

Africa's top public health body said last week it thought the situation was "not getting out of hand".

The virus circulating in Uganda is the Sudan strain of Ebola, for which there is no proven vaccine, unlike the more common Zaire strain seen during recent outbreaks in Democratic Republic of Congo.

WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in mid-October [2022] that a clinical trial of vaccines to combat the Sudan strain of Ebola could start within weeks.

The World Health Organization warned Wednesday [2 Nov 2022] that Ebola's arrival in the Ugandan capital highlighted the high risk of further spread of the deadly virus, calling on neighboring countries to boost their preparedness.

Since Uganda's health ministry first declared the outbreak on 20 Sep 2022, the country has registered more than 150 confirmed and probable cases, including 64 deaths, WHO said.

And since the deadly disease spread to Kampala last week, 17 cases have been confirmed there, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters.

"Although these cases are linked to known clusters, the very fact that there are cases in a densely populated city underscores the very real risk of further transmission," he said, speaking from WHO headquarters in Geneva.

There is a "very urgent need for increased readiness in districts and surrounding countries," he warned.

Ebola is spread through bodily fluids, with common symptoms being fever, vomiting, bleeding and diarrhea. It is fought through tracing, containment and quarantine.

Outbreaks are difficult to contain, especially in urban environments.

"Ebola in a complex, urban city like Kampala is not easy, and we have to do everything possible to pull every chain of transmission," WHO incident manager Abdi Mahamud told reporters.

Tedros said the U.N. health agency had on Tuesday [1 Nov 2022] released an additional USD 5.7 million from its contingency fund for emergencies, in addition to the USD 5 million previously released to address the Uganda crisis.

WHO, he said, was working closely with the Ugandan government and partners to respond to the outbreak and was calling for "a strengthened global response and increased donor investment."

Uganda's last recorded fatality from a previous Ebola outbreak was in 2019.

Ebola crisis in Uganda: A new public health warning from WHO
------------------------------------------------------------
Forty-six days have passed since the outbreak of Sudan virus in Uganda when a young man in Mubende was confirmed with the rare Ebola infection. There are now 130 confirmed cases of Ebola [now 131] and 21 probable cases reported. The death toll has also been rising with 43 confirmed [48 on 5 Nov 2022] and 21 probable deaths. The case fatality rate of confirmed cases is 33% and overall, confirmed and probable cases, 42%. Notably, 15 healthcare workers have been infected of whom 4 [according to most recent WHO sitrep, 6] have perished.

According to the World Health Organization's (WHO) update from 28 Oct 2022, Ebola has affected 7 of 147 districts, including Wakiso, the district in which the capital of Kampala, a densely populated city of millions sits on the shore of Lake Victoria. Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO director-general, said at this week's press conference, "Although these cases [in Kampala] are linked to known clusters, the very fact that there are cases in a densely populated city underscores the very real risk of further transmission and the very urgent need for increased readiness in districts and surrounding countries."

Some 1844 contacts remain under active follow-up, while 1194 have completed the 21-day observation period, the incubation period for Ebola to manifest in someone previously in contact with a confirmed or probable case.

The WHO also reported that they had released another USD 5.7 million from their Contingency Fund for Emergencies in support of the outbreak in the region on top of the USD 5 million previously distributed to the region.

The US Embassy in Uganda reported on Wednesday [2 Nov 2022] that the US has channeled USD 22.3 million "through implementing partners" in support of the response by Uganda's government and other international organizations. These efforts include 51 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) staff offering direct technical assistance and working in collaboration with district and national level task forces advising on response strategies and coordination.

Although the experimental Sudan virus vaccine trials have yet to begin, Dr. Henry Kyobe Bosa, the national incident manager for Ebola for Uganda's Ministry of Health, said in an opinion piece in the New York Times that the US support includes experimental monoclonal antibodies, MBP-134 (licensed to MappBio) and the antiviral Remdesivir.

Remdesivir, a broad-spectrum antiviral medication developed by Gilead Sciences, gained much media attention as one of the early pharmaceuticals for the treatment of mild to severe COVID-19. However, trial results from a WHO-initiated international study recommended against its use, due to lack of efficacy.

Remdesivir, a sort of wandering minstrel in search of an audience, was created and developed in 2009 to possibly treat hepatitis C and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections but was found to be ineffective against these 2 pathogens. Then, in October 2015, the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) announced that Remdesivir completely protected Rhesus monkeys from Ebola virus when they were treated with the drug 3 days after viral inoculation.

Remdesivir was fast-tracked through clinical trials in response to the Zaire Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa from 2013 to 2016. It was also used in the Kivu Ebola epidemic in the eastern region of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) in Central Africa between 2018 and 2020. There were a total of 3470 confirmed and probable cases then killing 2266 people. Four of these cases had spilled into Uganda. However, Remdesivir's use was discontinued by Congolese health officials after determining it was significantly less effective than various monoclonal antibodies that were available.

More recently, in a study published in JCI Insight on 23 May 2022, Remdesivir combined with a cocktail of monoclonal antibodies protected macaques, nonhuman primates, against advanced Sudan virus disease. Currently, the vaccines available against the Zaire strain of Ebola do not work against the Sudan strain as the viruses are too divergent in their evolutionary development. There are no licensed anti-Sudan virus therapeutics on the market.

Study findings were significant in that 80% of macaques who received the combination treatment within 6 days of being infected with the Sudan virus survived. However, after this period, the survival plummeted to 20%, meaning these treatments require immediate administration in probable or confirmed cases.

In early October [2022], the US initiated a clinical trial using the combination therapy of MBP-134 and Remdesivir in Uganda. Seven critically ill patients have thus far received the treatment. These efforts are being financially supported by the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response (ASPR), which announced last month [October 2022] when the trial was being launched in Uganda that they had provided Mapp Biopharmaceuticals, a San Diego-based research and development firm, a contract for USD 110 million.

Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response Dawn O'Connell said in a press release dated 4 Oct 2022, "One of the ways we enhance the nation's readiness for health emergencies is by investing in medical countermeasures for which there is no commercial market. The funding being provided by BARDA [Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority] will advance this research. If approved this treatment will put the US in a better position to prepare for and respond to future potential ebolavirus incidents. Given the current outbreak of Ebola Sudan in Uganda, this work is now even more important."

The rhetoric in the press release is unabashedly nationalistic and underscores the security and economic interests motivating such research. Instead, there should be a call for international collaboration to build centers of excellence and community treatment facilities in these regions where Ebola and other infectious diseases pose a daily existential threat.

As Dr. Bosa observed, "We know that the countermeasures we have work best when they are given in the earliest stage of this disease. Patients who have monoclonal antibodies late into their illness have died, for example. But most Ebola patients are going to public health facilities too late. Many have gone to private facilities or have tried alternative methods first. We also need more of a supply of treatments to treat patients we do see early."

Experience has taught healthcare providers that early intervention with intravenous hydration and supplemental oxygen can improve the prognosis for those infected with Ebola. This requires both trust in the public health infrastructure and aid and support for the front-line healthcare providers who are placing their own lives in peril.

The failure of medical science and public health to keep pace with the threat posed by emerging infectious diseases demonstrates that even the most dedicated scientists cannot overcome the social polarization within capitalist society. The mobilization of public health resources on a socially equitable basis can only be carried out through the intervention of the working class on an international basis, in struggle against the profit system.

The COVID pandemic that has raged for the last 3 years has revealed and exacerbated tremendous divisions in communities across the world. An international response early during the outbreak in 2020 to eliminate the virus while supporting people through the provision of material resource such as food, medicine, income, and access to internet and on-line educational material, could have beaten back the pandemic. ...

In the Ebola outbreak in Uganda, neighboring countries like Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, South Sudan, Tanzania and the Democratic Republic of the Congo are preparing for the possible spilling of the Sudan virus across their borders. The WHO has requested these countries activate an assortment of response mechanisms that include community surveillance readiness, laboratory training, health system preparedness, and border controls. The current risk assessment, considering the presence of Sudan Ebola virus in a densely populated urban setting, is very high at the national level (Uganda itself) and high at the regional level.

I personally don't think "the intervention of the working class on an international basis, is required in struggle against the profit system." The leaders of developed countries need to ensure equitable distribution of vaccines and therapeutics during outbreaks. No single country exists in a vacuum, which became very clear with COVID. There must be a global effort at all levels to make health care equitable. Infectious diseases do not respect borders. The author is correct, though, in stating "there should be a call for an international collaboration to build centers of excellence and community treatment facilities in these regions where Ebola and other infectious disease pose a daily existential threat." The problem is that political instability, violence, and lack of resources, prevent any enduring success of this endeavor. - Mod.LK]

Uganda extends lockdown as Ebola outbreak spreads
-------------------------------------------------
Uganda has registered over 150 confirmed and probable cases, including 64 fatalities.

Uganda on Saturday [5 Nov 2022] extended a 3-week lockdown on 2 districts at the centre of an Ebola outbreak which has claimed over 50 lives, curbing travel and closing public places.

Since the outbreak was declared in the central district of Mubende on 20 Sep 2022, the disease has spread across the East African nation, including the capital Kampala.

Fifty-one deaths reported have been reported as of Saturday [5 Nov 2022], according to Ugandan authorities.

The strain now circulating in Uganda is known as the Sudan Ebola virus, for which there is currently no vaccine, although there are several candidate vaccines heading towards clinical trials.

The World Health Organization (WHO) on Wednesday [2 Nov 2022] said Uganda had registered over 150 confirmed and probable cases, including 64 fatalities.

President Yoweri Museveni imposed a 21-day lockdown on Mubende and neighbouring Kassanda on 15 Oct 2022, but has said that nationwide curbs were not needed.

On Saturday [5 Nov 2022], Health Minister Ruth Jane Aceng told AFP that "the lockdown of Mubende and Kassanda districts ... will be extended for another 21 days."

These include a dusk-to-dawn curfew, a ban on personal travel and the closure of markets, bars and churches.

"We urge the public to comply and remain vigilant," she added. ...

Outbreaks are difficult to contain, especially in urban environments.

Museveni has also ordered the police to arrest anyone infected with Ebola who refuses to isolate.

WHO on Wednesday [2 Nov 2022] warned that there was a high risk of Ebola spreading further and called on neighbouring countries to boost their preparedness.

Uganda's last recorded fatality from a previous Ebola outbreak was in 2019.
