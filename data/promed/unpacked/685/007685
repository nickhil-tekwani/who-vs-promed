At least 45 cattle herds have been locked up following numerous positive tests for tuberculosis [Bovine tuberculosis, bTB].

Farmers on the Iveragh Peninsula in Kerry say it is the worst outbreak in [local] living memory. In 2017, there were 75 herds restricted in the peninsula, with a further 36 restricted because of issues on neighbouring farms.

Patrick O'Driscoll, chairman of the Irish Farmers Association South Kerry branch, called a meeting yesterday [Thu 18 Jan 2018] as the scale of the outbreak became clear.

Mr O'Driscoll, who lives on Valentia Island, said that more than 100 farmers had attended the meeting and were looking for a vaccination programme to be rolled out in the area.

He said: "We're not used to TB down in the peninsula; you'd have the odd reactor, but in 2016, we saw increased numbers, and in 2017, there were over 302 reactors in 45 herds. "We're expecting to find more; it's a moving figure."

Mr O'Driscoll said the area affected is approximately a 56-square-km [21.6 square mile] block from Kells to Caherdaniel, where many farms are fragmented. This means farmers have to frequently move cattle, which can lead to TB spreading between herds. Farmers are being advised to work with the Department of Agriculture and Food (DFA) officials by looking for badger setts on their land but to not disturb them, as the department will inspect for badger activity.

He also said that the group was hoping a new vaccination programme for badgers could be brought into the area.

In the past 10 years, the area has seen an explosion of deer, but the department has ruled them out on this occasion.

Mr O'Driscoll said that by reducing the badger population, the cycle of infection could be broken.

"We are hoping that the department will carry out a trial of badger vaccination against TB in the area. Farmers want the vaccination programme.

"There has always been a badger population in the area, and we want a healthy badger population."

Local councillors, he said, have made a commitment to secure the vaccination programme for the area.

He also said it was a very stressful time for farmers in the area, with 45 herds locked up, and he said that farmers affected by the outbreak had spoken with emotion at the meeting.

The DFA pointed out there was a high badger population in the area and a programme was underway to capture and test the animals.
"Where badgers are identified as the source, a survey is carried out, and the badgers captured and removed," said a department statement.

A spokesman said they were aware that this was a stressful time for farmers in the area and they were working with them and local vets.

Earlier this week, it was announced that vaccination of badgers would begin as an integral part of the bovine TB eradication programme.

The DFA said vaccination would commence in the areas which had already been part of the field trials, which had demonstrated the effectiveness of badger vaccination, and it would be rolled out over time in other areas.

[According to EU's annual reports (last available, 2016) Ireland is one of the 10 Member States (MS) not (yet) free of bovine tuberculosis ("non-OTF"), and one of the 5 of them (Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Spain and the UK) which, in 2016, received EU cofinancing for eradication programmes. These MS reported on their bTB prevalence situation in their non-OTF regions by the number of positive herds, the number of herds tested under the eradication programme, and the total number of herds existing. The number of positive herds reported was 4047 in Ireland (4002 in 2015), 335 in Italy (433 in 2015), 77 in Portugal (94 in 2015), 3048 in Spain (3070 during 2015) and 9694 in the UK (9628 in 2015); all reports concerned _M. bovis_.

According to OIE's data base, the numbers of bTB cases in Irish cattle during the 3 years 2014-2016 (in brackets, number of animals officially slaughtered due to bTB) were 16 145 (17 632), 15 317 (16 278) and 16 914 (17 531), respectively. - Mod.AS
