Prion disease suspected
A possible victim of [variant] CJD could have been infected 15 years ago
---------------------------------------------------
If a suspected case of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob [CJD (new variant)
in ProMED usage] disease in a man in Ireland is confirmed, the Food
Safety Authority of Ireland believes he may have become infected
10-15 years ago from the consumption of contaminated beef products in
Ireland.
The FSAI said that this timeframe would be the typical incubation
period for the disease. The Authority stressed that bovine spongiform
encephalopathy controls in place in Ireland since 1996 are very
strict and there are layers of robust control measures to ensure
maximum consumer protection in relation to BSE.
Dr. John O'Brien, chief executive at FSAI said that the incidence of
BSE in Ireland continues to decline in the cattle population,
demonstrating that the controls introduced in 1996 and 1997 are
working. There are fewer cases of BSE, and the vast majority of
current cases are in animals born before the introduction of these
enhanced controls.
"The main consumer protection measure has been the removal of
specified risk material from the human food chain," he said. "SRM are
the parts of an animal most likely to contain BSE infectivity if that
animal is incubating the disease. This SRM removal is supervised on a
day-to-day basis by veterinary inspectors. We are confident that the
controls in place are ensuring SRM removal and thus consumers are
being protected. The FSAI and the Department of Agriculture and Food
have been to the forefront in the EU with the most aggressive
controls to protect both animals and humans from the BSE agent."
He emphasized: "The FSAI, DAF, and the other agencies involved in
policing the food chain are working closely together to ensure full
compliance and maximum consumer protection. In fact, one of the key
factors for establishing the FSAI in 1996 was the BSE crisis. We base
our decisions upon the best scientific data and knowledge, and
develop inspection and audit controls to ensure maximum consumer
protection in relation to meat and meat products. A rigorous policy
of safeguards is now firmly established throughout the food chain."
O'Brien said that the FSAI's BSE Scientific Sub-committee
continuously reviews these controls and over the past 5 years has
recommended additional control measures when appropriate.
"We believe that the controls are proving to be effective, but public
confidence can only be maintained through continued vigilance and
transparency. The FSAI will continue to be the over-arching watchdog
and will sustain its independent audits of the current controls on an
ongoing basis. We are confident that based on current controls,
consumers of Irish beef are not being exposed to the BSE infective
agent," he said.
In Ireland, there is a sequence of controls for BSE along the food
chain. The feeding of meat and bone meal is prohibited to all farm
animals and there are stringent controls at rendering plants and feed
mills. All cattle are examined by veterinary inspectors before
slaughter at the abattoir, and rapid BSE testing is carried out on
all animals over 30 months of age. Veterinary inspectors, under
service contract to the FSAI, ensure slaughtered cattle have had SRM
removed. At boning plants, the carcasses are inspected again. In
butcher shops, environmental health officers under contract to the
FSAI inspect carcasses at this level. In addition, all butchers
operating in Ireland are aware that it is illegal to sell meat
products containing SRM.
