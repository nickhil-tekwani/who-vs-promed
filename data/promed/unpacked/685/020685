Milton Puziss, a microbiologist who helped develop the 1st human vaccine against anthrax in the United States, died on 9 Oct 2013 at the Edenton retirement community in Frederick, Maryland. He was 93. The cause was congestive heart failure, said his daughter, Marla Puziss.

Dr. Puziss was working for the Army Department at Fort Detrick, Md. when he developed an anthrax vaccine in the late 1950s with another scientist, George Wright. One purpose of the research was to find a vaccine to use in the case of a biological attack. Earlier anthrax vaccines had been developed in other countries.

The Wright-Puziss vaccine was tested in clinical trials, and a version of it is widely used today.

After 17 years with the Army Department, Dr. Puziss joined the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in 1968. He conducted research on Legionnaire's disease and other bacterial and fungal diseases. He retired as chief of the NIAID bacteriology and virology branch in 1986. He was a recipient of the NIH Director's Award.

Milton Puziss was born in Philadelphia and grew up in Shrub Oak, N.Y. After Army service in World War II, he graduated in 1948 from Kansas State University. In 1949, he received a master's degree in bacteriology and biochemistry from the University of Wisconsin, and in 1956, he received a doctorate in the same disciplines from the University of Southern California.

Mr. Puziss moved to the retirement community from his home in Frederick last year [2012]. He enjoyed woodworking and sailing.

His wife of 54 years, Penenah Kossow "Penny" Puziss, died in 2005. Survivors include 3 children, Marla Puziss of Atlanta, Matthew Puziss of Frederick, and John Puziss of Durham, CT; a brother; and 3 grandchildren.
