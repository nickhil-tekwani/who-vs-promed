Health officials said on Wed 14 Feb 2007, they are investigating a
possible link between peanut butter and more than 100 salmonella
cases in 37 states.
Chris Kircher, a spokesman from ConAgra Foods Inc., the maker of
Peter Pan brand peanut butter, said that the company has been
contacted by the FDA, and added that the FDA and the CDC were looking
at the possibility that peanut butter was the cause of the salmonella
cases. Other companies have also been contacted.
"We're not clear yet what brands are involved, but we are talking
with them to better understand the information that they have at this
time," Kircher said.
A CDC spokeswoman confirmed that the agency was checking into a possible link.
Peanut butter appears to be the cause of the cases, said Dr. Timothy
Jones, deputy state epidemiologist for the Tennessee Department of
Health. Tennessee has had about 20 cases of salmonella that may be
related to peanut butter, Jones said, adding that in all there were
cases in at least 37 states dating as far back as October 2006. He
could not say how many total cases were being investigated, but a
health expert said more than 100 cases were involved.
The salmonella being investigated is a strain known as _Salmonella
[enterica_ serotype] Tennessee, Jones said. Health officials have
found "2 sets of DNA fingerprint patterns that appear to be related,
but not identical" in samples from patients. But, he added,
investigators have not been able to grow the salmonella in any brand
of peanut butter.
Kircher said ConAgra randomly tests a jar of peanut butter in each
production line each hour and has found no traces of salmonella since
at least 2004. "We're trying to understand what they've found, what
peanut butters are involved and what if any actions are necessary to
take at this point," he said.
A spokeswoman from JM Smucker Co, maker of Jif peanut butter, said
authorities were not investigating the company's peanut butters,
which include the Jif and Smucker's brands. A spokesperson for
Unilever NV, which makes Skippy peanut butter, could not be reached
for comment.

[The FDA alert below is much stronger than the above posting
regarding the association of the brands of peanut butter and _S._
Tennessee. As well, the number of seemingly associated cases (288
versus 100) and the number of states (39 versus 37) are both larger
in the FDA report.
As of yet, there are no "smoking peanut butters" found, that is, the
same organism has not yet been isolated from the implicated food. An
outbreak of salmonellosis (serotype Mbandaka) was, however, reported
from Australia in 1996, that was related to peanut butter with the
organism isolated from both peanut butter and patients (1, 2).
Burnett and colleagues (3) studied peanut butters that had been
experimentally inoculated with salmonella, and had viable organisms
at 5 deg. C for 24 weeks. There was less retention at 21 deg. C.
More importantly, Shachar and Yaron (4) demonstrated that thermal
treatments are inadequate to consistently destroy _Salmonella_ in
highly contaminated peanut butter and that the pasteurization process
cannot be improved significantly by longer treatment or higher
temperatures.

The FDA is warning consumers not to eat certain jars of Peter Pan
peanut butter or Great Value peanut butter due to risk of
contamination with _Salmonella_ Tennessee (a bacterium that causes
foodborne illness). The affected jars of Peter Pan and Great Value
peanut butter have a product code located on the lid of the jar that
begins with the number "2111." ConAgra manufactures both the Peter
Pan and the Great Value brands in a single facility in Georgia. Great
Value peanut butter made by other manufacturers is not affected.
If consumers have any of this Peter Pan or Great Value brand peanut
butter in their home that has been purchased since May 2006, they
should discard it.
Symptoms of foodborne illness caused by salmonellosis include fever,
diarrhea and abdominal cramps. In persons with poor underlying health
or weakened immune systems, _Salmonella_ can invade the bloodstream
and cause life-threatening infections. Individuals who have recently
eaten Peter Pan and/or Great Value brands peanut butter beginning
with product code 2111 and have experienced any of these symptoms
should contact their doctor or health care provider immediately. Any
such illnesses should be reported to state or local health
authorities.
FDA's warning is based on a just-completed epidemiological study by
CDC and the states and local health agencies, which links 288 cases
of foodborne illness in 39 states, to consumption of varying types of
Peter Pan peanut butter. This report was provided to FDA on Tue 13
Feb 2007.
The outbreak appears to be ongoing and the first consumer may have
become ill in August 2006. The cause of foodborne illnesses can be
difficult to identify. As a result of extensive epidemiological
testing and recent case control studies, CDC was recently able to
identify Peter Pan peanut butter as the likely cause of illness.
[ProMED has previously reported on associations between peanuts and
salmonellosis but not peanut butter. - Mod.LL]
Great Value brand peanut butter beginning with product code 2111 is
manufactured in the same plant as Peter Pan peanut butter and, thus,
is believed to be at similar risk of contamination.
ConAgra is recalling all Peter Pan and Great Value peanut butter
beginning with product code 2111 that already was distributed. The
company also is destroying all affected products in their possession.
The company will cease production until the exact cause of
contamination can be identified and eliminated. ConAgra will advise
consumers to destroy any Peter Pan and Great Value brand peanut
butter beginning with product code 2111 in their possession. To
assist in this endeavor, FDA has sent investigators to ConAgra's
processing plant in Sylvester, Georgia, where the products are made,
to review records, collect product samples, and conduct tests for
_Salmonella_ Tennessee.
FDA will provide regular updates as more information becomes available.
