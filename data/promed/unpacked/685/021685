Norway banned most Danish meat imports and stepped up customs controls
Wednesday, two days after neighboring Denmark reported a case of mad cow
disease. Norway joined the 3 Baltic countries of Lithuania, Latvia and
Estonia in barring imports of Danish beef. Major Swedish supermarkets began
voluntarily pulling Danish meat products from their shelves on Tuesday.
Denmark on Monday recalled all meat products that could be contaminated by
bovine spongiform encephalopathy, (BSE) or mad cow disease, after finding
the illness in a Danish-born cow.
Norway and the other nations want products stopped because contaminated
meat has been linked to a deadly human brain ailment, new variant
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (nv-CJD).
The Norwegian Food Control Authority said it was banning many types of
high-risk Danish fresh meat, including beef, sheep and goat products
containing bones and other organs that could harbor the disease.
