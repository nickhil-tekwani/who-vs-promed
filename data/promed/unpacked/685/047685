[There was no report on MERS-CoV activity in Saudi Arabia yesterday 6 Jan 2017, but parsing out the totals suggests that there were no newly confirmed cases, nor fatalities, nor recoveries reported on 6 Jan 2017. If I am in error, a correction will be posted once further information is available. - Mod.MPP]

As of 13:00 [1:00 PM] today [7 Jan 2017], there have been a total of:
1530 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection, including
636 deaths [reported case fatality rate 41.6 per cent],
883 recoveries, and
11 currently active cases [including 1 asymptomatic household contact].

Since the last ProMED-mail update [5 Jan 2016], there have been a total of:
1 newly confirmed case,
0 newly reported fatalities, and
3 newly reported recoveries.

Information on newly reported case:
Date: 7 Jan 2017 (1 case)
http://www.moh.gov.sa/en/CCC/PressReleases/Pages/statistics-2017-01-06-001.aspx
1- A 73-year-old Saudi female, non-healthcare worker from Buraidah [Al Qaṣīm region], currently in critical condition. Classified as a secondary healthcare acquired case in a patient.

Information on newly reported recoveries (3 recoveries):
Date: 7 Jan 2017 (3 recoveries)
http://www.moh.gov.sa/en/CCC/PressReleases/Pages/statistics-2017-01-07-001.aspx

1- A 30-year-old expat female, healthcare worker from Khamis Mushayet ['Asīr region], no history of co-morbidities [reported as a newly confirmed case on 29 Dec 2016, at which time she was noted to be asymptomatic. At the time of confirmation was classified as a secondary healthcare acquired case in a healthcare worker (identified through contact screening). - Mod.MPP]

2- A 41-year-old expat female, healthcare worker from Khamis Mushayet ['Asīr region], no history of co-morbidities [reported as a newly confirmed case on 29 Dec 2016, at which time she was noted to be asymptomatic. At the time of confirmation was classified as a secondary healthcare acquired case in a healthcare worker (identified through contact screening) - Mod.MPP]

3- A 60-year-old Saudi male, non-healthcare worker from Madinah, with a history of pre-existing co-morbidities [checking the line listing of cases, fatalities and recoveries that I've been maintaining, there were no 60-year-old males from Madinah pending final outcome information. There was a 70-year-old Saudi male from Madinah, reported as a newly confirmed case on 2 Jan 2017, at which time he was noted to be in stable condition. At the time of confirmation was classified as a primary case with a history of direct exposure to camels in the 14 days preceding onset of illness. - Mod.MPP]

[In the last ProMED-mail MERS-CoV update (MERS-CoV (01): Saudi Arabia (QS,RI,MD), RFI 20170105.4744802) I mentioned that 4 out of the 7 newly confirmed cases of MERS-CoV reported since 1 Jan 2017 were reported from Buraidah, all of whom were classified as primary cases with identification of high risk exposures still under investigation. At that time I queried, "Is there ongoing transmission in the healthcare environment that has not been identified (perhaps in outpatient clinics, as both the 2 newly reported fatal cases from Buraidah did have a history of pre-existing co-morbidities)? Or is there undocumented person-to-person transmission ongoing in the community that is increasing?" 2 of the 4 cases had been reported as fatalities at the time of the initial confirmation so exact exposure histories were presumably difficult to obtain.

Today's newly confirmed case also comes from Buraidah, is also a female (the other 4 cases are females), and is identified as a secondary healthcare acquired case in a patient. Given the cultural practice of separation of men and women outside of the household environment, the likelihood of 5 women having MERS-CoV infection confirmed within one week, with only one having documentation of nosocomial transmission raises suspicion of other healthcare acquired cases or perhaps community acquired. Of course this doesn't account for the possible index case. The most recent case prior to this cluster was reported from Buraidah on 11 Dec 2016, also in a female, also classified as a primary case with high risk exposure history still under investigation at the time of report. During the period 1 Oct 2016 through 31 Dec 2016 there were 5 reported cases of MERS-CoV in Buraidah. The 1st case, a 41-year-old male reported on 18 Oct 2016, had a history of direct contact with camels in the 14 days preceding onset of illness. The remaining 4 cases were all classified as primary cases pending identification of high risk exposures.... the 1st 3 of these 4 cases were males (reported 29 Oct 2016 and 2 reported on 3 Nov 2016) and then the female case reported on 11 Dec 2016. All of the earlier cases during this period had a history of pre-existing co-morbidities...

Definitely food for thought re: possible low level transmission ongoing in Buraidah, perhaps in the healthcare environment.
