I do believe that an entomological investigation has been undertaken
in South Kordofan Province, Sudan and trust that we will soon have
the details about the likely mosquito vectors in the latest YFV
outbreak there. Unfortunately, the entomological/ecological
investigations may almost be too late, the delay between outbreak
control and ecological investigation being a private bugbear of mine,
as the epidemiology and diagnosis of arboviruses and zoonoses are so
inextricably linked with 'macrobiology', climatology and habitat.
Fortunately, we do have good accounts of the potential vectors of YFV
in the Nuba Mountains region of South Kordofan, based on the
pioneering work of the Stack Medical Research Laboratories, Sudan
Ministry of Health, amongst other prominent medical research
collaborators at the time. _Aedes (Stegomyia) aegypti_ played a minor
role in the 1940 outbreak while _Aedes (Fredwardsius) vittatus_ and
_Aedes (Diceromyia) furcifer/taylori_ (may have included _Ae. (Dic.)
cordellieri_, which was described long afterwards) were believed to
be responsible for most of the transmissions. Efficient urban
mosquito control existed in Sudan well before the 1940 outbreak and
the situation appears not to have changed, based on reports of the
absence of _aegypti_ in the outbreak zone.
What is interesting to note is that the current YF outbreak appears
to be following the same trend as the previous ones in Sudan and
Ethiopia, when transmission waned as the population densities of the
feral mosquito species dropped sharply by mid-November, after the
rainy season.

[We thank Alan Kemp for this information. Especially interesting is
his belief that an entomological investigation is being undertaken to
determine the vectors of the yellow fever outbreak. I hope we
eventually learn what mosquitoes were incriminated as vectors.
I agree that in too many situations, vectors of arboviral infections
are not identified until transmission is on the wane and it is too
late to be of much practical use. Often, but not always, this is due
to lack of local entomological expertise and resources. Realistically
I do not see the procedure improving much in the foreseeable future.
