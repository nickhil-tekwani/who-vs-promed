Non-O1 Group _Vibrio cholerae_ Found in Hainan Province, China
-----------------------------
Isolation of a pathogenic bacterium -- non-O1 group _Vibrio cholerae_ --
from the blood of a septicemic patient was reported recently by a team led
by Gu Haiyang, Assistant Chief Technician in the Testing/Analysis Department
of People's Hospital, Hainan Province. Gu revealed that according to
phenotype testing, DNA G+C mol testing, and serological testing, the
pathogen was determined to be O13-group _V. cholerae_.
It is understood that this strain not only can secrete cholera toxin (CTX),
but is also accompanied by a thick capsule and lateral flagellum. Research
and testing conducted by a Chinese pharmaceuticals and biologicals testing
institute and by the Medical Information Institute of the Chinese Academy of
Medicine has verified that this bacterial strain heretofore has not been
identified either in China or abroad, and that it is the first time in China
that a non-O1 group _V. cholerae_ has been isolated from a septicemic
patient's blood.
Experiments prove that the main pathogenicity of this strain results from
the septicemia induced by the bacterium's thick capsule. Assays indicate
that the strain's toxicity in mice is especially high, and it is a fact that
the septicemic patient died from this strain 3 days after admission to the
hospital. The strain is sensitive to the vast majority of antibiotics. At
present, it is being preserved at the Chinese Microbiological Culture
Preservation Center.

[The O13 group should not be confused with cholera O139. This is claimed to
be the first report of septicemia caused by an O13 strain, and may
represent the emergence of disease caused by a serotype of _Vibrio
cholerae_ not previously reported in China. ProMED-mail would welcome
further information confirming the serotype, indicating the number of
patients involved and discussing the potential of this strain to cause
large outbreaks. - Mods.JW/ES
