Federal and state agricultural research scientists in South Texas
have teamed up to combat a disorder in potatoes that affects the
production of potato chips. So far, its cause is unknown. The
disorder, called zebra chip for the dark stripes it leaves in the
flesh of raw potatoes, is not harmful to human health but causes
serious and expensive reductions in crop yields and quality, the
scientists said.
Crops have been affected in Guatemala, Mexico, Texas and as far north
as Colorado. Symptoms are especially pronounced when potatoes are
sliced and fried to make potato chips, causing frying plants to
reject entire loads of affected potatoes. It also affects fresh
market potatoes.
"Zebra chip defies typical diagnostic techniques that would point to
a known bacteria or a virus causing this disorder, so we suspect it's
something more complex," said Dr. John Goolsby, a research
entomologist at the U.S. Department of Agriculture Kika de la Garza
Subtropical Research Center at Weslaco.
Goolsby, who began studying the disorder in 2005, suspects whatever
is causing zebra chip is transmitted by insects. "It appears to be
vectored by an insect, because when we place a cage over potato
plants to exclude insects, the plants don't get zebra chip," he said.
"And of the insects we've evaluated, we believe it is vectored by the
potato psyllid, an insect native to this part of the world. But we're
not sure what the pathogen is."
Potato psyllids migrate north and south through the Great Plains of
North America, over-winter in native vegetation in South Texas, but
have never been a problem in the Rio Grande Valley, Goolsby said.
"What caused the change? We don't know," he said. "This happens often
in insects. A different genotype emerges or a different pathogen
becomes associated with the insect, but we suspect this is all caused
by a native insect, not an exotic that has come in."
While USDA scientists continue basic research on the disorder and the
vector insect, Texas A&M University System researchers are evaluating
economic impacts of the disorder and ways to help growers deal with
the issue. An economic impact study by Texas A&M's department of
agricultural economics showed that, left unabated, losses from zebra
chip would reach USD 100 million in lost business in Texas and almost
1000 jobs.
"These economic impacts represent what could occur in Texas if zebra
chip is not controlled and eventually eliminated," the study said.
"It appears likely that the condition could become more prevalent in
the southern parts of Texas and in some regions may result in a
complete loss of potato acreage. If this occurs, the economic impacts
would be more severe, leading to greater losses in business activity,
income and employment."
Jack Wallace Jr. grows about 1/3rd of the Rio Grande Valley's 3000
acre potato crop, located mostly in the McCook area. He and his
family have been growing potatoes since 1964 and had no major
problems until zebra chip showed up in 2000. "It's 1st noticeable as
the plants are growing," he said. "You get foliar symptoms, usually
after flowering. You see leaf curl, the upper leaves die off and a
there's a yellowing effect."
Severity of zebra chip varies from year to year and within a field,
Wallace said. "Last year [2006] was tough," he said. "This year, the
crop looks nice and pressures seem to be low, which could be
attributable to the cool, wet winter we've had. But it's important to
find out what's causing this zebra chip, because the livelihood of a
lot of families depends on potato production. We've expressed this
problem to our state senator, Juan "Chuy" Hinojosa, who was very
receptive, concerned and supportive of our plight."
To help growers in the short-term, Dr. T-X Liu, a Texas Agricultural
Experiment Station entomologist in Weslaco, is evaluating 20
insecticides for their ability to control potato psyllid. The tiny
insects feed on juices of leaves using their piercing-sucking
mouthparts and may be injecting some pathogens or toxins in the
process, Liu said.
"We'll be evaluating 20 insecticides that were developed by 5
different companies for use on other pests," Liu said. "Hopefully,
one or more will be effective against potato psyllid. We should start
seeing results in April or May [2007] and have data a few months
later." Like growers, his research field plots of potatoes were
planted at the Texas A&M Agricultural Research and Extension Center
in Weslaco in December 2006 and will be harvested in the spring, Liu
said. He is currently rearing populations of potato psyllids to be
released into those field plots.
Dr. Boris Castro, a Texas Cooperative Extension entomologist, will be
involved in developing long-term, integrated pest management
solutions to control zebra chip and potato psyllids, which can also
affect tomato crops.
Goolsby said solutions developed here will be applied to other potato
production regions. "Zebra chip is not limited to Texas," he said.
"But South Texas is where the problem 1st showed up in the U.S. in
2000, so this is where we've assembled the research team to combat
this problem. We're investigating every possible aspect, and once we
figure out how to manage zebra chip, those solutions will be shared
with potato production zones farther north."

[2] Zebra Chip: A New Disease of Potato
Date: March 2007
Source: Nebraska Potato Eyes vol. 19 [edited]
<http://www.panhandle.unl.edu/pdf/potato_eyes_march07.pdf>

Based on our findings and those of others, we believe that zebra chip
(ZC) is likely a disease complex involving at least 2 distinct
pathogens and no less than 2 insect vectors. There are a number of
plant diseases in which similar symptoms are caused by 2 distinctly
different pathogens, such as "spraing" of potato in the United
Kingdom and marginal necrosis of strawberry and "bass richess" in
sugar beet in France. So, while this type of disease complex is
unusual, it is not unique to ZC. Future studies on ZC will
concentrate on determining the cause of ZC in Texas. We are currently
investigating 3 potential pathogens as the cause, all of which will
represent newly described plant pathogens. Once the primary cause of
Texas ZC can be determined, we will be able to design laboratory
diagnostic tests that will allow us to study the biology and the
ecology of the pathogen in the field. We are in the process of doing
this for the stolbur-like phytoplasma responsible for ZC in Nebraska.
Using molecular diagnostic tests, we hope to determine the insect
vector or vectors responsible for transmitting this ZC agent and the
potential of reservoir hosts of the pathogen being present in
Nebraska. We believe that ZC disease management will involve an
integrated approach incorporating clean seed, insect and reservoir
host management and varietal resistance.

[Other facts stated in item [2] are:
- The geographical extent of the disease is not yet known, but there
is anecdotal evidence of a similar potato disease in Eastern Europe
and Southern Russia.
- ZC tubers generally do not sprout or produce weak plants; some ZC
tubers may produce nearly healthy plants that produce progeny tubers
with or without ZC; this may be due to late infection or some other
factor and needs to be investigated further.
- No resistant potato cultivars are known so far.
- One of the pathogens suspected to be involved is a stolbur-like
phytoplasma (see post 20060223.0585); it appears to be the primary
cause of ZC in Nebraska (NE) but to have only a minor role in ZC in
Texas (TX); foliar symptoms of ZC in TX and NE are similar, but tuber
symptoms can be quite different.
Spraing disease causes brown streaks in potato tubers. Two viruses
appear to be involved: _Tobacco rattle virus_ (TRV; _Tobravirus_,
_Togaviridae_) transmitted by nematodes, or _Potato mop top virus_
(PMTV; _Pomovirus_, _Togaviridae_) transmitted by the powdery scab
fungus _Spongospora subterranea_.
Generally, symptoms are not a reliable means of diagnosis of plant
pathogens. Similar diseases can be caused by different organisms,
there may be co-infections or disease syndromes involving additional
factors. ZC appears to be a both economically and scientifically
important disease or syndrome with the potential of leading to the
discovery of new pathogens.
