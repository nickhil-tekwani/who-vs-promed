Statement of EFSA on the risks for public health due to the presence of
dioxins in pork from Ireland, issued 10 Dec 2008
------------------------------------------------
Summary
-------
The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) received a request on 8 Dec 2008
from the European Commission, Directorate General Health and Consumers
requesting urgent scientific advice on the risks to public health due to
the contamination by dioxins in pork from Ireland. Considering the urgency
of this request for advice, EFSA issued a statement following Art. 13 b [a
"fast-track response". - Mod.AS] of the "Decision concerning the
establishment and operations of the scientific committee and panels"
adopted by the Management Board of EFSA on 11 Sep 2007.

During routine monitoring of Irish pork, elevated levels of polychlorinated
biphenyls (PCBs) were found in pork. Further investigations revealed the
presence of dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs at levels up to 200 pg WHO-TEQ/g fat.

The toxic responses to dioxins include dermal toxicity, immunotoxicity,
carcinogenicity, reproductive, and developmental toxicity. The toxicity of
dioxins is related to the amount accumulated in the body during a lifetime,
the so-called body burden. A tolerable weekly intake (TWI) of 14 pg
WHO-TEQ/kg body weight (bw) has been established by the Scientific
Committee on Food (SCF) in 2001.

EFSA has based this statement on a limited data set, assuming that the
average person has an exposure at the TWI corresponding to a body burden of
4000 pg/kg body weight. EFSA also assumed that exposure at these high
levels only began in September 2008 and that effective measures have now
been taken to remove this excessive dietary exposure from Irish pork and
pork products.

EFSA calculated several exposure scenarios for both average and high
consumers assuming 3 different dioxin concentrations in the pork (50, 100,
200 pg WHO-TEQ/g fat), and 3 different proportions of contaminated meat
(100, 10, and 1 per cent).

In very extreme cases, assuming a daily consumption of 100 per cent
contaminated Irish pork, for a high consumer of pork fat during the
respective period of the incidence (90 days), at the highest recorded
concentration of dioxins (200 pg WHO-TEQ/g fat), EFSA concludes that the
uncertainty factor embedded in the TWI is considerably eroded. Given that
the TWI has a 10-fold built-in uncertainty factor, EFSA considers that this
unlikely scenario would reduce protection, but not necessarily lead to
adverse health effects.

In a more likely scenario with a daily consumption of 10 per cent
contaminated Irish pork for a mean consumer of pork fat for the respective
period of the incidence (90 days), at the highest recorded concentration of
dioxins (200 pg WHO-TEQ/g fat), the body burden would increase by
approximately 10 per cent. EFSA considers this increase in body burden of
no concern for this single event.

Beef alert
Q & A
-----
Is it now known that beef is contaminated?
Yes, preliminary tests have shown the presence of marker PCBs in a number
of beef samples tested.

Is beef being recalled?
No, beef is not being recalled.

What has been done?
All animals in herds shown to be above the proposed legal limit will be
taken out of the food chain.
Any products from these herds will not be released onto the market.
The European Commission is being informed of the results.

Why is there not a recall, as was the case with pork and bacon?
Beef is not being recalled as it is considered that there is no public
health concern. The reason for this is as follows:
- only 45 farms were supplied with potentially contaminated feed out of
approximately 110 000 beef farms in the Republic of Ireland. The total
number of cattle slaughtered from these herds from 1 Sep 2008 amounts to
some 3000 out of a total annual slaughter of approximately 1.5 million.
This represents 0.2 per cent of total annual beef production in the
Republic of Ireland;
- results from 11 of the 45 farms have become available. Of these, 8 were
clear and 3 were just above the proposed legislative limits for marker PCBs
in beef. Tests are being carried out in the remaining farms, which remain
under restriction until cleared;
- the samples are technically non-compliant with proposed EC limits for
marker PCBs but not at a level that would pose any public health concern.
This is a different situation compared to pork products, where dioxin
contamination was confirmed and the levels of dioxins were 80 to 200 times
the legal limit;
- cattle consume a wider variety of feeds and the way their bodies process
the feed is different, which makes the risk of contamination significantly
lower than in pork;
- there is a very robust traceability system in place for beef.

What about beef and beef products?
We are not advising that consumers destroy or return beef or beef products.
It is unlikely that they are contaminated, and any possible contamination
would be so low as not to cause any concern.

What about dairy products?
We have no information to suggest that there has been contamination of
dairy cattle, therefore we can assume that milk and dairy products are not
affected. The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food will inform us
if this situation changes.

What precautions were taken while waiting for these results to come back?
Since the authorities became aware that contaminated feed may have gone to
these cattle farms, restrictions were put in place. These restrictions will
only be lifted when clear test results are reported.

What are PCBs?
PCBs are a similar set of compounds to the group of chemicals known as
dioxins. Like dioxins, their toxicity depends on the chemical structure of
each chemical in the group. Some PCBs have similar toxicity to dioxins and
these are called the dioxin-like PCBs. Other PCBs are sometimes referred to
as marker-PCBs or non-dioxin-like PCBs and these are much less toxic than
dioxins or dioxin-like PCBs.

If a food contains Marker PCBs will it always contain dioxins or
dioxin-like PCBs?
Contamination of food with marker PCBs indicates that there is a potential
contamination of the food with dioxin-like PCBs or even dioxins. Usually
the level of dioxin-like PCBs or dioxins, if present at all, will be very
much lower that the marker PCBs. It is difficult to determine whether the
presence of marker PCBs in food will be predictive of dioxin contamination
and therefore it is always prudent to test also for dioxins and dioxin-like
PCBs. Sometimes marker PCBs can be present but dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs
can be well below legal limits for the food. The presence of marker-PCBs
are not considered to be a direct health concern unless you were exposed to
a very high dose, much higher than you would get from eating beef
contaminated with marker PCBs.

From: Conor Kretsch <conor@cohabnet.org>


The following pages from the Irish Times' website report that some cattle
herds in the Irish Republic that were given feed from the same source as
the feed behind the current pork scare, have now tested positive for
elevated levels of dioxin
<http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2008/1209/breaking21.htm> and
<http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2008/1209/breaking64.htm>.

I note that both the Irish minister for agriculture and the Irish prime
minister (Taoiseach) state that the detection of dioxin in these cattle, at
"2 to 3 times proposed legal levels", is merely a "technical
non-compliance" and therefore all Irish cattle products (beef and dairy)
are considered to be safe and there will be no related recall (although
there as yet has been no confirmation as to the period of time over which
these herds may have been exposed to dioxin-tainted feed, whether any
potentially tainted Irish cattle products have reached the market, or
indeed if such products have been or will be tested). In the light of the
current scare over Irish pork, this has unfortunately sent a confusing
message to the public and added to media hysteria. It is worth noting that
Ireland has a comprehensive "farm to fork" food tracing system, so a
limited recall should be possible in any event. In that light, the decision
to include all organic pork in the recent pork recall is unfortunate and
adds to the confusion over the cattle results.

While the Irish authorities are certainly correct in seeking to avoid a
public panic, and are dealing with a particularly delicate situation given
Ireland's current economic woes, it seems some less ambiguous messages, and
more definitive guidance on risks from short term exposure to certain
dioxins, are needed. Even if only to avoid horrific (but amusing) headlines
like this one

Used oil may have caused Irish food crisis - paper
--------------------------------------------------
Used oil from electrical transformers may have caused the dioxin
contamination in animal feed that has led to an international recall of
Irish pork products, the Irish Times reported on [Wed 10 Dec 2008].

Earlier this week, more than 20 countries cleared their shelves of Irish
pork after dioxins up to 200 times the legal levels were found on 10 pig farms.

The Irish Times, without citing sources, said the contamination may have
been caused by waste oil originating in Northern Ireland that should have
been stored or destroyed.

The farm ministry said it was not in a position to comment on its
investigations into the contamination. Ireland's Environmental Protection
Agency, which is assisting the ministry in the probe, also declined to comment.

The crisis escalated further on Tuesday [9 Dec 2008], when authorities said
3 cattle herds in Ireland were contaminated with dioxins.

Ireland, one of the world's top 5 beef exporters, said there was no need to
recall any Irish beef products because the level and extent of
contamination in the affected animals was much lower than the levels
discovered at the pig farms.

Ireland's chief veterinary officer, Paddy Rogan, will confirm to EU
counterparts in Brussels on Wednesday [10 Dec 2008] that Irish beef is safe
and can continue to be traded normally on both domestic and export markets,
the farm ministry said in a statement. "We are facing yet another big
challenge for the beef industry," Aidan Cotter, chief executive of
Ireland's food board said on Wednesday.

Worries for Ireland's pig meat industry continued to grow as processors
have refused to reopen their slaughterhouses until they get compensation
for the loss of trade. Talks between the processors and government resumed
on Wednesday [10 Dec 2008] and prime minister Brian Cowen said progress had
been made. "I remain confident of achieving an outcome that will facilitate
the early resumption of processing," Cowen told deputies during a
parliamentary debate. "We are acutely aware of the impact that suspension
of slaughtering has had on the hundreds of producers throughout the country
and the thousands of workers whose jobs have been compromised by recent
events."

Farmers said a return to production was vital. "If you go out to the
supermarket shelves this morning they are being replaced with imported
produce," said Tim Cullinan, head of the Irish Farmers Association's pigs
committee. Cullinan said stocks were building up on farms. "We need to move
50 000 to 60 000 pigs into the processing plants on a weekly basis," he
told public broadcaster RTE. "We seem to be literally the meat in the
middle of the sandwich here," he said. "We want to be back out on our farms
and running our business."

[The consumer's concern at the background of this -- still unfolding --
food safety scare is just one more manifestation of the public's lost
confidence, the roots of which dating back to the last 2 decades of the
previous century, particularly (but not solely) due to BSE (bovine
spongiform encephalitis). The 16-volume Phillips BSE Inquiry Report, issued
in London in October 2000 after 33 months of hearings, included, among its
13 key conclusions, the following points:

"- at times officials showed a lack of rigour in considering how policy
should be turned into practice, to the detriment of the efficacy of the
measures taken;
- at times bureaucratic processes resulted in unacceptable delay in giving
effect to policy;
- the possibility of a risk to humans was not communicated to the public or
to those whose job it was to implement and enforce the precautionary measures;
- the Government did not lie to the public about BSE. It believed that the
risks posed by BSE to humans were remote. The Government was preoccupied
with preventing an alarmist over-reaction to BSE because it believed that
the risk was remote. It is now clear that this campaign of reassurance was
a mistake. When on 20 Mar 1996 the Government announced that BSE had
probably been transmitted to humans, the public felt that they had been
betrayed. Confidence in government pronouncements about risk was a further
casualty of BSE."

It is indeed this loss of confidence, which continues haunting authorities,
all over the globe. This time, as twice before in Europe, it is dioxin. The
real risk to public health is, probably, rather negligible but the
economical impact is most serious. Clearly, the Irish authorities are aware
of the points raised in the Phillips report: to rigorously apply measures,
to prevent delays, to communicate risks, to tell the truth, and to maintain
maximal transparency. But all those virtues still seem to fall short of
fully regaining the lost confidence. It remains to hope, however, that this
scare will be shorter than previous ones. - Mod.AS]
