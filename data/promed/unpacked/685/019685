[During 2014, 77 outbreaks of BTV-4 (bluetongue serotype 4), affecting cattle, sheep and goats, were reported. This current event was resolved on 10 Jan 2015. See final report at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000017050_20150123_170700.pdf.

Although the serotype has still not been determined, based on recent past history, it is likely to be BTV-4. As Mod.AS commented in the posting 20150908.3630573: "This outbreak might reflect the seasonal recurrence of the BTV-4 virus, characteristic for this disease."
