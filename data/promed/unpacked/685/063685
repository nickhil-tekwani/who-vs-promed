Facing a 3-year surge in the sexually transmitted diseases of gonorrhea and syphilis, Lane County Public Health Officer Paul Luedtke is asking doctors -- and residents -- for vigilance and for fast action at the 1st symptom. By the end of November [2013], the confirmed gonorrhea count in the county this year reached 202, already up 60 percent from 2012's total and climbing. Syphilis is a much smaller number, with 23 cases so far this year, but the historic pattern in Lane County is 1 or 2 cases annually. The disease tracking system isn't perfect, Luedtke said, and the tendency is to under report and so under count. "We are certain the numbers are higher for each disease," he said.

"Occasionally, if you look over a 10-year period, we do have little outbreaks of sexually transmitted diseases. This one is lasting longer than we want, and it's significantly higher than we want, so it's concerning," he said.

Luedtke said 3 trends are to blame for the spike in sexually transmitted diseases locally: the economy, public health program cuts, and a declining use of condoms. During the great recession, unemployment in Lane County exceeded 14 percent. "When our unemployment rate ticked up above 10 percent, many more people did not have access to health care. They were putting off things. Some of these (sexually transmitted diseases), they smolder for a while. People say, 'Oh, maybe it's nothing.' Of course, people don't stop having sex, so it spreads."

The public health system shoulders a share of the blame, Luedtke said. For years, the county told Lane County residents: "Come on in if you don't have insurance. Come on in if you have a problem and want to remain anonymous," Luedtke said. "Because of budget cuts several years ago, we got rid of that -- and it's very clear to us through surveys that people didn't really know where to go." In recent months, Lane County restarted a one-day-a-week clinic to see patients with sexually transmitted diseases, Luedtke said, "because we realized we were part of the problem."

Luedtke urges no delay in seeking treatment -- regardless of ability to pay. Free care is available through Community Health Centers of Lane County, Volunteers in Medicine, and the White Bird Clinic, he said. "If you don't have insurance or you haven't signed up for Cover Oregon yet because the system isn't working, you can still be seen. It's important for the community to know that," he said.

Luedtke also has a message for Lane County physicians: Bone up on diagnosis and treatment of sexually transmitted diseases. "Not all providers are diagnosing syphilis, for example, as they should," he said. Syphilis, a bacterial infection, first shows itself with an ulcer on the genitals. "If you don't treat it, the bug keeps replicating in your body," Luedtke said. Next, the patient gets a full body rash. Some doctors are misdiagnosing that as a viral rash rather than recognizing the secondary expression of syphilis. "People aren't thinking syphilis because for years we didn't have much syphilis," he said. "We're not alone; the state has a lot more syphilis than we've had for a long time."

Gonorrhea, also a bacterial infection, first shows in men as burning with urination and penile discharge. Women are asymptomatic half the time or have vaginal discharge and pelvic pain. Some local doctors aren't up to speed with the dosage of antibiotic needed to knock out gonorrhea, Luedtke said. The recommended dose used to be 125 mg of ceftriaxone, but now it's 250 mg, due to increased resistance of the bacteria to the antibiotic. "We still have people giving 125," Luedtke said. "The patient gets a little better. It doesn't hurt to pee anymore. The patient doesn't have pus coming out of their penis, but it only knocks the infection down 70, 80, 90 percent. They keep having sex. They spread the bugs, and within a week or so after taking the antibiotics, it comes back because it wasn't killed."

[The state of Oregon can be seen on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at http://healthmap.org/r/9BEV. Lane County, with a population of 351 715 in 2010 (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lane_County,_Oregon#Government), extends from the Pacific Ocean to the Cascade mountain range; it can be located on the map at http://geology.com/county-map/oregon.shtml. Eugene, with a population of 156 185, is the 2nd-largest city in the state (after Portland) and the county seat.

In the US in 2000, the number of cases and the incidence rate of primary and secondary syphilis (P&S), contagious stages of syphilis, were 5979 and 2.1, respectively, the lowest since reporting began in 1941 (http://www.cdc.gov/std/stats11/tables/1.htm). The number of cases and incidence rate of P&S syphilis then increased almost yearly to 13 970 and 4.5 per 100 000 in 2011 (http://www.cdc.gov/std/stats11/tables/1.htm). The male-to-female rate ratio for P&S syphilis rates rose from 1.5 in 2000 to 8.2 in 2011 and in recent years, young men who have sex with men (MSM) have accounted for an increasing number of syphilis cases in the United States; in 2011, 72 percent of P&S syphilis cases were among MSM (http://www.cdc.gov/std/stats11/syphilis.htm).

Most cases of P&S syphilis in Oregon in 2011 were reported from Multnomah County (http://www.cdc.gov/std/stats11/tables/32.htm), which is part of the Portland metropolitan area and, though smallest in area, is the state's most populous county (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multnomah_County,_Oregon). Among counties and independent cities of the US ranked by number of cases reported in 2011, Multnomah County ranked 43rd highest with 71 cases of P&S syphilis and an incidence rate of 9.7 cases per 100 000 (http://www.cdc.gov/std/stats11/tables/32.htm), while the whole state of Oregon reported 97 cases in that year. In Oregon in 2011, the rate of P&S syphilis among males was 5.1 per 100 000 population compared to the US male rate of 8.2 per 100 000, but was increasing steeply since 2008 (http://www.cdc.gov/std/Syphilis2011/Syphilis-2011-All-Profiles.pdf).

Reported increases in incidence of infectious syphilis among MSM have been characterized by high rates of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) co-infection, high-risk sexual behavior, use of drugs such as methamphetamines, use of Internet chat rooms to meet sex partners (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5510a1.htm) and more recently use of smartphone applications like Grindr, a gay social networking site (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grindr). Grindr allows users to meet other men within close proximity using the mobile device's global positioning system (GPS) location-based services to show men nearby who are also on Grindr. The increases in P&S syphilis have been attributed in part to "HIV prevention fatigue", -- that is, diminished motivation to practice safer sex.

However, the news report above fails to characterize the cases of syphilis or gonococcal disease in Lane County, Oregon as to age, sex, sex behavior, or use of drugs, social networking Internet sites, and smartphone apps. A more detailed description of the cases would be appreciated.
