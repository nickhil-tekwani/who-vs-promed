New Cases of Malaria Imported to Germany from The Gambia and Senegal
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine in Hamburg we have
seen several cases of _P. falciparum_ in travellers and Gambians returning
from Gambia but also [from Senegal (several guests of a well-known resort
in coastal Senegal). We share the concern expressed by other European
hospitals that this is an unusual increase in imported cases.

Information on Increased Malaria Transmission in The Gambia
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I have spoken to the MRC [Medical Research Council representatives (today)
who confirm that:
1. They have seen an increase in local malaria at the coast;
2. They are seeing a significant increase in chloroquine-resistant malaria;
3. Many resident expatriates have developed severe falciparum malaria for
the first time; and
4. There has been increase in rainfall but not remarkably so.
It will take quite a long time to get the data on the change this year from
previous years.

[With the information kindly provided by Ron Behrens from the Hospital for
Tropical Diseases, there seems to be no doubt that there presently is an
increased risk of chloroquine-resistant malaria for visitors to The Gambia.
I presume that it includes both chloroquine and paludrine (proguanil)
resistance, as chloroquine as single prophylaxis has long been abandoned in
West Africa. Travellers should be advised to take the suggested prophylaxis
as prescribed, and the choice stands between lariam (mefloquine), malarone
(atovaquone/proguanil), and doxycycline. - Mod.EP
