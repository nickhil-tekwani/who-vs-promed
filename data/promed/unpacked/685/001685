- Fri 26 Feb 2021. Monitoring travelers
CBS News (abridged, edited)
https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ebola-monitoring-program-u-s-considering-as-new-cases-reported-in-africa/


The U.S. will soon be monitoring travelers coming into the country from 2 nations impacted by the Ebola virus, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced Fri 26 Feb 2021. The CDC confirmed these plans after CBS News 1st reported the details on Friday [26 Feb 2021] night.

Starting next week, the "very small number" of travelers arriving from Guinea and the Democratic Republic of the Congo will be funneled to 6 U.S. airports where their information will be collected and shared with local health officials, the CDC said.

As of 25 Feb 2021, 9 Ebola cases have been reported in Guinea, resulting in 5 deaths, and 8 cases have been reported in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, resulting in 4 deaths, according to the World Health Organization. The CDC stressed in its statement that "the outbreaks are centered in remote areas of these countries," and said "the risk of Ebola to the United States is extremely low."

The CDC said airlines "will collect and transmit passenger information to CDC for public health follow-up and intervention for all passengers boarding a flight to the U.S. who were in DRC or Guinea within the previous 21 days. This information will be shared with U.S. state and local health departments to appropriately monitor arrivals in their jurisdiction."

A source familiar with the decision said John F. Kennedy in New York, Dulles outside Washington, D.C., O'Hare in Chicago, Hartsfield-Jackson in Atlanta, Los Angeles International Airport and Newark Liberty outside New York were all being considered as monitoring points. The CDC did not specify which airports it plans to use.

This funneling approach is similar to steps taken in 2014 when travelers from Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea were directed to 5 of those airports, where they had their temperature taken upon arrival.

Between March 2014 and April 2016, there were more than 28 000 cases of Ebola in West Africa, and 11 310 people died, according to the CDC.

With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, there is recognition within the CDC that resources for additional monitoring are stretched thin, according to one of the people familiar with the discussions. Almost 30 000 people were monitored by the CDC for Ebola beginning in 2014, an effort that required hundreds of CDC staff, the CDC said.

"This is a great example of how we have to be prepared for anything in the public health arena," another source familiar with the discussions said about the monitoring before the news was announced.

In 2014, the Obama administration appointed Ron Klain to lead the U.S. Ebola strategy. Klain is now President Biden's chief of staff.

[Diverting and monitoring for Ebola in US travelers from the DRC and Guinea when there are only a handful of cases seems overly cautious and an added burden on public health personnel at a time when there is tremendous pressure from COVID. Resources are already stretched thin. The situation is very different from that occurring during the 2014 outbreak in West Africa. Certainly, medical personnel should be alerted to the ongoing outbreak in the DRC and Guinea so they can be certain their hospitals and staff are prepared to respond immediately should a potential patient be identified. - Mod.LK]

- Fri 26 Feb 2021. US: risk low
Reuters (edited)
https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-ebola-usa-cdc/u-s-cdc-says-risk-of-ebola-to-the-united-states-is-extremely-low-idUSKBN2AR032?rpc=401&


The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said it was closely following outbreaks of Ebola in Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Guinea and said the risk of Ebola to the United States was extremely low.

"Out of an abundance of caution, the U.S. government will institute public health measures for the very small number of travelers arriving from the DRC and Guinea," the CDC said in a statement late on Fri 26 Feb 2021.

"The Biden Administration is committed to working closely with the affected countries to end these outbreaks before they grow into epidemics," the CDC said.

Guinea started an Ebola vaccination campaign on Tue [23 Feb 2021], the World Health Organization said earlier in the week, as authorities race to contain the 1st resurgence of the virus there since the world's worst outbreak in 2013-2016.

The resurgence of the virus, which causes severe bleeding and organ failure and is spread through contact with body fluids, has alarmed governments in the region and international health organizations, concerned that a major outbreak could overwhelm health infrastructures already battling a pandemic.

The CDC said on Fri 26 Feb 2021 that beginning next week, travelers from DRC and Guinea will be funneled to 6 U.S. airports. Airlines will collect passenger information for public health follow-up and intervention for all passengers boarding a flight to the U.S. who were in DRC or Guinea within the previous 21 days.

[2] Guinea: Caregivers
- 26 Feb 2021
Daily Mail (abridged, edited)
https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-9305209/In-Ebola-stricken-Guinea-caregivers-no-risks.html


Ebola causes severe fever and, in the worst cases, unstoppable bleeding. It is transmitted through close contact with bodily fluids, and people who live with or care for patients are most at risk.

High mortality rates, and harrowing memories of the previous outbreak, has made some in Nzerekore reticent about seeking treatment. However the prognosis appears better this time around.

At least 5 people have died in the latest outbreak, according to the country's health agency, although there is some confusion over the exact death toll.

Guinean health authorities have also reported 10 confirmed or probable Ebola cases and are tracking 400 more contact cases.

The country also launched a vaccination campaign against Ebola this week, a treatment which was unavailable during the last epidemic.

Guinea's government, medical NGOs, and the World Health Organization mobilised quickly after news of the outbreak. Vaccinations began only a week after the outbreak was confirmed, and medical teams were rapidly deployed to Nzerekore. The treatment centre there consists of a small compound of several buildings painted yellow and red, surrounded by a metal grating.

"People need to understand that an Ebola treatment centre is not a hospice," said Dally Muamba, a doctor employed at the centre by the Alliance for International Medical Action.

He added that the centre is using a treatment developed in the Democratic Republic of Congo -- where Ebola is endemic -- which involves injecting patients with antibodies extracted from survivors of the disease.

"Chances of survival are much higher today," Muamba says.

Alseny-Modet Camara, the head of the treatment centre, agrees. "The mortality rate was up to 70 percent before we were able to reduce that mortality to less than 10 percent," he said.

A middle-aged man emerges from one of the small buildings with his eyes downcast, drips in both arms, and sits on a plastic chair. The man has just learned he has Ebola. An Ebola survivor from the 1st epidemic, nicknamed "Dr Papus," broke the news to him, and tried to reassure him. "I tell them that I have faced this disease, that we must not give up," says Papus, whose father and uncle both died of Ebola in 2014.

He says he did not believe in the epidemic until he fell ill, and subsequently recovered. "Since I am already immune, I have to help others, I have to go back and face this demon again," he says.

But not everyone survives. On Thu 25 Feb 2021 evening, a Red Cross pick-up truck arrived at the centre, its paintwork faded from repeat disinfections. It had come to remove the body of a patient who had succumbed to Ebola and whose burial will also be subject to strict medical precautions.

The response this time was very fast. But the problem now seems to fall on diagnosis: early and rapid diagnosis is needed to prevent a patient from going to multiple healthcare centers for medical help. If rapid tests were in stock in clinics in countries where Ebola is enzootic/endemic and doctors were trained to use them if Ebola is even remotely suspected when the patient presents with fever and bleeding, that would be a good practice. It could prevent spread beyond the initial site. - Mod LK]

[3] Sub-Saharan Africa: Spillover events
- 24 Feb 2021
Forbes (abridged, edited)

I reported recently on the 2 new outbreaks of Ebola in Sub-Saharan Africa. At the time, there were 4 cases in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and 8 cases in Guinea. Since then, another 2 or 3 cases have been found in the DRC.

This is the 12th Ebola epidemic in the DRC, and the 2nd in Guinea.

Ebola is a zoonotic pathogen, meaning that the virus is maintained in a wild animal species, or reservoir. Under conditions that aren't particularly well understood, it periodically spills over from animal populations into people. Ebola 1st came to global attention in 2015 during the West Africa epidemic that spread widely throughout Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, and less extensively in Italy, Mali, Nigeria, Senegal, Spain, the UK, and the USA.

A map published in the scientific journal PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases in 2015 [see comment below] shows where Ebola virus outbreaks have historically occurred along with the animal species implicated in the spillover process. The timeline on the right shows when these outbreaks occurred, including an outbreak of an unidentified pathogen in DRC in 1972 that is now suspected to have been Ebola.

It has been 5 years since that map was published. Since then, there have been 5 more outbreaks, bringing the total to 27, including (1) a 2018 outbreak in Equateur province (DRC); (2) an epidemic that lasted from August 2018 to June 2020 in the Eastern region of Kivu (DRC), which also spread to Uganda; (3) an outbreak last year [2020], again in Equateur province (DRC); and (4) and (5) the new outbreaks in the DRC and Guinea.

This invites us to ask the question: is the spillover of Ebola increasing in frequency?

If we look back at just the last 10 years, there have been 9 outbreaks of Ebola since 2010 -- almost one per year -- compared with just 18 in the preceding 38 years, or roughly one every other year.

From this point of view, it certainly looks like Ebola outbreaks have been increasing in frequency. But another look at the timeline shows a curiosity. Ebola seems to have been in a lull with no reported human cases between 1980 and 1993. (There were, however, a few outbreaks in non-human primates in the early 1990s). Viewed this way, one might think of Ebola as having 3 epochs:

1972-1979: 5 outbreaks in 8 years
1980-1993: 0 outbreaks in 14 years
1994-present: 22 outbreaks in 28 years.

The average time between outbreaks in each of these epochs is shown in the following figure [see URL].

From this perspective, the frequency of outbreaks now is not meaningfully different than it was in the 1970s, when Ebola was described. So, which historical view is correct? Either way, we have a mystery to solve.

If we take the timeline view, considering each outbreak, it seems that, indeed, Ebola spillover events are increasing in frequency. Why? What is happening to cause the increase in outbreaks? One hypothesis concerns environmental change, as Ebola outbreaks seem to correlate with shifts in vegetation and the transition between dry and wet seasons. Another explanation concerns the frequency of encounters between humans and wild animals, perhaps because of land conversion or increased demand for animal protein from hunting.

However, if we take the epochal view, grouping outbreaks into distinct periods, then there would seem to be no evidence for an increase.

However, there is the mystery of the lull in the 1980s and early 1990s. Why would there not have been any outbreaks for 14 years when they occurred every one to 2 years on either side of this period? Did we simply miss them for some reason or were there really that many fewer outbreaks?

In either case, it is reasonable to expect that Ebola will continue to spill over into human populations. Identifying spillover risk factors, developing surveillance systems for early detection, and securing healthcare and public health resources for rapid response are needed to protect against future Ebola epidemics. Fortunately, the benefits of these investments also have a kind of "spillover," providing protection not only from Ebola but other endemic and emerging diseases too.

[Alexander KA, Sanderson CE, Marathe M, et al. What Factors Might Have Led to the Emergence of Ebola in West Africa? PLoS NTD Published: 4 Jun 2015 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0003652.

Abstract:
"An Ebola outbreak of unprecedented scope emerged in West Africa in December 2013 and presently continues unabated in the countries of Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia. Ebola is not new to Africa, and outbreaks have been confirmed as far back as 1976. The current West African Ebola outbreak is the largest ever recorded and differs dramatically from prior outbreaks in its duration, number of people affected, and geographic extent. The emergence of this deadly disease in West Africa invites many questions, foremost among these: why now, and why in West Africa? Here, we review the sociological, ecological, and environmental drivers that might have influenced the emergence of Ebola in this region of Africa and its spread throughout the region. Containment of the West African Ebola outbreak is the most pressing, immediate need. A comprehensive assessment of the drivers of Ebola emergence and sustained human-to-human transmission is also needed in order to prepare other countries for importation or emergence of this disease. Such assessment includes identification of country-level protocols and interagency policies for outbreak detection and rapid response, increased understanding of cultural and traditional risk factors within and between nations, delivery of culturally embedded public health education, and regional coordination and collaboration, particularly with governments and health ministries throughout Africa. Public health education is also urgently needed in countries outside of Africa in order to ensure that risk is properly understood and public concerns do not escalate unnecessarily. To prevent future outbreaks, coordinated, multiscale, early warning systems should be developed that make full use of these integrated assessments, partner with local communities in high-risk areas, and provide clearly defined response recommendations specific to the needs of each community."

Certainly, lessons have been learned from and since the 2013 West African outbreak. In addition, vaccines are now available as are effective antivirals. Treatment of patients is greatly improved. But equally important are communication and education, which must be maintained as well as public health infrastructure. Resources should be committed to maintaining clinics, which can be used for other endemic diseases once an outbreak ends. Training of staff should continue.

With these practices, should Ebola re-emerge, the community will be well prepared to respond immediately. - Mod.LK]
