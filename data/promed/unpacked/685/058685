ACIP discusses factors leading to mumps outbreak in the north east
------------------------------------------------------------------
The number of cases linked to a June [2009] mumps outbreak at a New York
summer camp has climbed to 2336, CDC [Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention] officials reported during the Advisory Committee on
Immunization Practices [ACIP] meeting this week [24-25 Feb 2010]. After
initial spread into other populations throughout the state and areas of New
Jersey, CDC epidemiologist Kathleen Gallagher said the disease has now been
exported to Connecticut, Quebec, and Israel.

Incidence remains highest among boys in the Hasidic community because they
usually spend longer hours at private schools, Gallagher said, mostly
around other people belonging to this population. In addition to day
students, these schools also board students from a variety of other regions
and states. Therefore, boys potentially exposed to mumps may inadvertently
spread the disease among other communities when they return home for
holidays, emphasizing the importance of up-to-date, 2-dose vaccinations in
this age group.

The potential for a 3-dose measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine (MMR II,
Merck) was also a focal point at the meeting. Currently, officials in
Orange County, New York have tried administering a 3rd dose to children in
efforts to control the outbreak. Although little data are available,
Gallagher said studies to evaluate the efficacy of a 3-dose vaccine regimen
are ongoing.

Additional discussion addressed the genotype responsible for the outbreak,
as well as the current vaccine's ability to effectively prevent the spread
of disease. Officials have identified genotype G from the United Kingdom,
which was also present in the 2006 mumps outbreak, as the culprit for the
current outbreak. Gallagher noted that there was "nothing special" about
genotype G, and the MMR vaccine may [induce] antibodies to this strain.

Nevertheless, other committee members said the mumps component of the MMRV
[measles, mumps, rubella, varicella] has always been less effective than
the measles and rubella components, and some attributed this to the strain
contained in the vaccine. "It's a complex situation that we have, but as
I've said to my colleagues from Merck, we do need a better mumps strain
than we currently have," Stanley A Plotkin, MD, of Sanofi-Pasteur, said.
"Even though we have a number of [mumps strains], none of them are perfect."

[The number of cases in this outbreak has increased from the 1521 reported
on 29 Jan 2010 to the current figure of 2336. This outbreak is still far
from contained and now has spread in the USA to the state of Connecticut,
as well as to Quebec, Canada, and Israel.

The mumps component of the current MMR triple vaccine may be less effective
than the other components of the triple vaccine. The potential value of
giving 3 doses of MMR vaccine was discussed at the ACIP meeting, in efforts
to control the outbreak. Results are awaited. - Mod.CP]
