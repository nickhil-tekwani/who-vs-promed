Anthrax (8 persons, suspected, hospitalized) -- Kyrgyzstan (Jalal-Abad region)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8 people, including one child, were hospitalized in the Jalal-Abad region of Kyrgyzstan with suspected anthrax, according to the Ministry of Emergency Situations of the Republic of Kyrgyzstan.

"Eight villagers from Gian Talap, Tobo-Korgon, Ak-Tobo were hospitalized to the infectious department of Aksy district hospital with signs of anthrax," said a statement. It is noted that there were 7 men and a 12-year-old girl among those hospitalized. According to preliminary data, all of them participated in the slaughter of animals.

There are over 100 natural foci of anthrax in the territory of Kyrgyzstan with spores contained in the soil and transferred to animals with the grass. Anthrax is an acute infectious disease which can be fatal without timely aid. It is transmitted to humans through meat of infected animals and their products: hides, skin and so on. It cannot be transmitted from person to person.

[According to the Ministry of Health, all patients participated in the slaughter of sick animals. At the moment, control measures are carried out in the area. A group of medical workers are working in Aksy district of Jalal-Abad region. They are checking the households to identify all the people who participated in the slaughter, and with suspected anthrax. - Corr.BA]

[As I have commented before, this region of western Kyrgyzstan is under constant threat of anthrax from uncontrolled livestock anthrax in the Furgana valley stretching west in Uzbekistan. See: http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/commonwealth/kyrgyzstan_physio-2005.jpg. The only way to prevent these human cases is to effectively prevent livestock cases through proactive routine vaccination. The optimum would be a unified Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan joint control programme to achieve anything in controlling this disease. The human outbreaks follow from slaughtering and butchering animals moribund with anthrax, and consuming and selling the meat in local markets.
