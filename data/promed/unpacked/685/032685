There is a Cornell News Bureau press release on the subject [if you want a
copy, contact Roger Segelken <hrs2@cornell.edu>; they have just added Maine
as another state affected with Songbird Fever '98.
This "Songbird Fever '88" last happened in the Northeast in the Spring of
1988; and affected eastern NY, western MA and CT, VT, NH, and ME. Back then
9 species of migratory songbirds were affected. In 1988 it was once again
serotype typhimurium as it is being reported now. Back in 1988 we also had
100's of feline cases in hunter cats who were catching moribund and dead
birds at bird feeders.
In 1998 we are just starting to see salmonella cases in cats in New York
State and in their owners that are temporally associated with birds and
feeder contact.
Also, contact Margaret Barker at Cornell Lab of Ornithology who runs the
Feeder Watch program; she has contacts with over 10000 people watching
birds! see below:

"In fact, we don't know which of the 2,000 or so possible strains of
salmonella is killing songbirds," says Patrick McDonough. The bacteriologist
in Cornells Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory says there is some concern
that the recent epidemic of salmonellosis could be due to the
multi-antibiotic resistant _Salmonella Typhimurium_ DT104. Tests now under
way at the USDAs National Veterinary Services Laboratory in Ames, Iowa, are
trying to identify the salmonella strain affecting songbirds, McDonough notes.
"We started getting reports of dying birds in late January from some
participants in Project FeederWatch," says Margaret Barker, education
coordinator at the Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology, where the
13,500-member citizen-science project is headquartered. "Then it was quiet 
until late February and March, when we heard many more reports of bacterial
disease in flocking birds," she says, referring to species such as pine
siskins, evening grosbeaks, American goldfinches and common redpolls.
"We'd like to know what stressors are making birds so susceptible this year
to bacterial disease," says Cornell wildlife veterinarian Barry K. Hartup.
However, one possible cause of stress could be unaccustomed, long-distance
flights to the United States by birds that normally winter in Canada.
Participants in Project FeederWatch, who count feeder birds throughout North
America, are reporting "irruptions" of redpolls and other flocking species
into the United States. Regional food shortages in Canada are believed by
some ornithologists to be the cause for the unusual migration.
Hartup, who also studies conjunctivitis in house finches, says wild birds
frequently carry one or more forms of salmonella without becoming ill 
unless their immune systems are stressed or unless a particularly virulent
strain of salmonella comes along. He recommends against medicating sick
birds by the general public for two reasons: Holding or rehabilitating
migratory birds requires a federal license. And treating birds with
antibiotics can appear to cure the illness while making the birds "carriers"
and potentially infecting many others.
WHAT SYMPTOMS DO BIRDS WITH SALMONELLOSIS SHOW?
A bird with salmonellosis appears tame. It might sit quietly for days in a
sheltered spot. Often, its feathers are fluffed out, and you might see it
hold its head under its wings. As the disease progresses, the bird might
exhibit a wobbly head and staggering walk. You might witness shivering or
convulsions, and the bird might have trouble swallowing. Within a few hours
after the symptoms show strongly, the bird simply falls over and dies.
WHAT SHOULD I DO WITH MY DEAD BIRDS? CAN LABS OR VETS USE THEM?
Dead birds should be disposed of by wrapping tightly and putting in outdoor
garbage containers with tight lids. Some state wildlife agencies or research
veterinary colleges might want the birds for study. Call those institutions
for instructions on how to keep the birds  usual instructions are for the
birds to be kept cool or frozen in a tightly-closed plastic bag. Be sure to
include data such as the location and date you found the bird.
WHERE IS THE DISEASE?
As of March 19, 1998, the National Wildlife Health Center in Madison, Wis.,
had received reports of sick or dead birds at bird feeders in 13 Midwestern
and Eastern states. Specifically, salmonellosis is now confirmed as the
cause of songbird sickness or mortality in the following ten states:
Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Missouri, New Hampshire, New York,
Pennsylvania, Vermont, and Wisconsin. Similar incidents of passerine
mortality without lab confirmation are reported in Connecticut, Ohio and
Massachusetts. Feeder Watchers began reporting the disease to Lab staff as
early as late January. The disease seemed to retreat but is now spreading
again.
HOW UNUSUAL IS THIS DISEASE IN THE EAST AND MIDWEST? IS THIS OUTBREAK DUE TO
EL NINO?
A major outbreak of salmonellosis was reported in the Northeastern United
States in the spring of 1988. It is a more common occurrence in the West and
Northwest, where every few years a die-off occurs, usually involving Pine
Siskins. This West/Northwest outbreak has been documented by Project
FeederWatch participants. We cannot at this time determine if the salmonella
outbreak is due at least in part to the milder-than-usual winter in the East
and Midwest. But, this is an interesting question.
WHICH BIRD SPECIES ARE HARDEST HIT?
During the current outbreak, most reports of mortality include pine siskins,
American goldfinches and common redpolls. New York birds hardest hit by the
outbreak are Common Redpolls.
IS THE OUTBREAK CONNECTED TO THE WINTER FINCH INVASION?
We can't say that there is a connection to the high numbers of finches and
red-breasted nuthatches reported in the Northeast this year.
