A widely publicized study that says feeding cattle hay for five days before
slaughter wipes out _E. coli_ bacteria in the gut is, according to this
story, coming under fire. Peter Doris, special projects manager for the
Ontario Cattlemen's Association, has warned producers not to yank their
market-ready steers off grain corn just yet.
Questions are being asked about the reliability of the Cornell University
study published in the Sept. 11 issue of the weekly journal Science. The
study implicated high grain diets fed to finishing cattle in the creation
of acid-resistant _E. coli_ bacteria. The study went on to say that feeding
hay to feedlot cattle for five days before slaughter reversed that acid
balance, reducing the number of potentially toxic _E. coli_ bacteria in the
animal's gut.
Apparently Washington State University (WSU) scientists plan to publish a
critique of the Cornell University study, charging that the Cornell study
has gaping holes in it, and that it should have been subjected to review by
other scientists before it was made public. [In my experience Science does
the latter. - MHJ
Other scientists have produced studies contrary to the Cornell report, the
critique says, pointing to a number of studies showing no difference in _E.
coli_ populations between grass-fed and feedlot cattle. Nor have other
scientists found a difference in the acid pH of cattle rumens between
animals fed on grass and those fed diets with as much as 90 per cent grain,
the WSU group charges.
Furthermore, it is unlikely that contamination found in meat samples came
directly from cattle intestinal tracts, the critique says. A more likely
source is the animal hides, where bacteria can live for weeks before they
are transferred to equipment in a packing plant.
The WSU group also expressed concern that a rapid switch in diets will
cause metabolic distress and may even set the stage for colonization of the
animal's gut by salmonella, another potential source of food poisoning.
Doris was further cited as saying that subjecting cattle to a special diet
before slaughter is a problem in itself since most market-ready cattle are
sorted from pens in feedlots no more than 12 hours before they board the
truck to the packing plant, adding, "Before we get to that point, we need
to clarify if the research findings are valid."
The prevalence of _E. coli_ in beef cattle is low, Doris noted, citing
research presented by scientists at a meat workshop in Guelph last spring.
At that time Kansas State University-based scientists Jan Sargent said _E.
coli_ is widely distributed between herds and individual animals. Any herd
has between one and three per cent of cattle shedding _E. coli_ bacteria in
their manure. "Sometimes these animals can change," Doris says. Animals
that test positive for _E. coli_ can be negative on a second test.
Similarly, animals that tested negative the first time can show up as
positive later.
