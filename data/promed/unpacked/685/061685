Washington state has confirmed its 1st case of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) diagnosed in pigs illegally imported into the state. It is the 1st time the disease has been found in Washington, according to a release from the Washington State Veterinary Medical Association.

The disease manifests with clinical signs of reproductive impairment or failure in breeding animals and respiratory disease in pigs of any age. The release states PRRS is the most economically significant disease to affect US swine production since the eradication of classical swine fever (CSF). Once PRRS is established, it is hard to get rid of.

The Washington State Department of Agriculture's (WSDA) Animal Services Division Compliance Program began an investigation into illegally imported pigs into the state on 25 Jun 2020. An Idaho-based livestock dealer purchased 704 pigs in mid- to late May [2020] from an Iowa production facility with a Montana slaughter destination, but the pigs ended up in Idaho and Washington, the release says.

The pigs were missing the necessary health documents for entry into either Idaho or Washington. The department's investigation found most of the pigs were sold in Idaho, but at least 13 entered Washington. The Idaho State Department of Agriculture is conducting its own investigation into whether or not laws or regulations were broken.

When WSDA completes its investigation, the findings will be reported for possible enforcement actions and says the USDA has been notified of the incident, the release says. A necropsy of a pregnant sow, which was one of the 13 pigs brought into Washington, triggered the investigation. The pigs were sold on Craigslist, and it's been reported some of the other pigs in the group were sick as well. The necropsy showed the sow was infected with PRRS virus and circovirus 2, neither of which had been previously identified in Washington pigs.

The release cites strain from COVID-19 on the meat-processing industry contributed to the situation in which importers brought unwanted pigs from the Midwest into Washington. Normally about 1000 pigs come into the state per year, but more than 4000 have been imported this year [2020], some illegally, it says. The influx puts Washington's pigs at risk for swine diseases common in higher-density swine states and for the diseases to establish a foothold in the state. [I fail to see how strain from COVID-19 and importation of illegal animals are related. While some will argue a shortage of manpower, this is not true when related to imports of animals into states. - Mod.TG]

[The disease emerged in North America and Europe, roughly simultaneously, in the late 1980s. It was 1st called by the wonderfully descriptive title "mystery swine disease." It is also commonly found in Asia.

The disease is characterized by late-term abortions, stillbirths, piglets born weak, and respiratory signs in pigs of all ages. Production losses from the disease are severe. It is a very damaging disease economically, as the fruit of much of the investment on a swine farm is lost through abortion and infertility.

Requirements for PRRS vaccines can be seen in OIE's (World Animal Health Organization) Manual for Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines for Terrestrial Animals (https://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/3.08.06_PRRS.pdf). - Mod.TG
