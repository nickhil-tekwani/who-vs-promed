Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1(35387090008): Piracicaba, Sao Paulo
Date of start of the outbreak: 1 Mar 2015
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: apiary
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Bees (hives) / 46 / 1 / 0 / 0 / 0
Affected population: in March 2015, a swarm of honey bees (_Apis mellifera_) was captured and held in the apiary of the Useful Insects Laboratory, Department of Entomology and acarology of the Graduate School of Agriculture "Luiz de Queiroz", University of Sao Paulo (USP). Days later, 20 adult females of the small hive beetle (_Aethina tumida_ Murray) were detected in the crate containing the swarm captured. No larva was found and no apparent damage was observed to the hive. At the beginning of the investigation, the apiary included 6 hives of honey bees (_Apis mellifera_) and 40 stingless bee hives. The remaining hives showed no presence of beetles.
Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]:
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Bees (hives) / 2.17 / 0 / 0 / 0
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: in May 2015, beetle specimens were sent to an expert in taxonomy of beetles at the University of Sao Paulo for taxonomic identification. The result of the preliminary identification was communicated to the official veterinary service only in December 2015 and the species _Aethina tumida_ never reported in the country was indicated. Then investigations to confirm the agent and to assess the extent of infestation began. Beetles samples were sent to another laboratory of Entomology, which confirmed the species _Aethina tumida_ in February 2016. The investigation in the hives currently present in the initial local detection did not show the presence of the beetle. Epidemiological investigations are on-going within a 20 km [12.4 mi] radius of the location where the first infested hive was detected. In an apiary in a neighboring municipality, adults of a similar beetle were detected. They were sent for identification. The property is interdicted until confirmation and the radius of investigation was extended. Meetings with representatives of associations of beekeepers and industries related to the sector of beekeeping were carried out on the guidance regarding detection, notification and prevention /control measures of the spread of the agent.

Control measures
Measures applied: quarantine; surveillance outside containment and/or protection zone; no vaccination; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: disinfection/disinfestations; modified stamping out

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Biological Institute of Sao Paulo (local laboratory) / Bees / entomological investigations / 16 Feb 2016 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

It should be noted that the preliminary identification was communicated to the official veterinary services in December 2015, even though the 1st diagnosis was in May 2015. Given that this is the 1st time that small hive beetle, _Aethina tumida_ , is reported by Brazil and, in fact, the 1st official report made in South America, it is very important that such information be made available in a timely fashion so that the country, as well as neighboring countries, can take any necessary precautionary measures to minimize further spread.
