Paragonimiasis from Eating Raw Imported Freshwater Crab
-----------------------------------------------
Two cases of this parasitic infection have been identified in persons
who consumed live, imported, freshwater crabs in a restaurant in
Orange County, Santa Ana, CA, USA.
"The Orange County Health Care Agency has received reports of 2 cases
of lung fluke infection caused by the parasite Paragonimus. These
infections are usually related to eating raw or undercooked
freshwater crab that is infected with the parasite," said Dr. Hildy
Meyers, Medical Director of Public Health Epidemiology and Assessment.
Lung fluke infection can be a serious illness in humans, but it is
not transmitted from person-to-person. Symptoms of lung fluke
infection can include cough, difficulty breathing, diarrhea,
abdominal pain, fever and hives. The parasite, Paragonimus, can
migrate from the lungs to other organs, and infection can last for
years. Medication is available to treat the infection. "We encourage
anyone who has developed any of these symptoms after eating raw or
undercooked freshwater crab, even if the symptoms are mild, to
contact their physician as soon as possible and provide information
about when and where raw crab or crayfish may have been consumed. In
many people, onset of symptoms may not occur until 6-10 weeks after
ingestion of raw, undercooked, salted or pickled crab. It is also
very important that freshwater crab and crayfish are properly cooked
and not undercooked before they are eaten," Dr. Meyers stated.

[Paragonimus is a trematode belonging to the same group of helminths
as _Schistosoma_ and _Opistrochis_. The most common Paragonimus
infection in humans is _Paragonimus wetermani_, which is found
worldwide in tropical and subtropical areas. Humans and several other
mammals can be infected. When Paragonimus eggs hatch in fresh water,
the miracidium enters different snails and develops into cercaria,
which infect freshwater crabs and crayfish, where they form cysts in
gills and muscles. When freshwater crabs are eaten raw, the parasite
penetrates the gut wall, migrates through the abdominal cavity and
passes the diaphragm, where it develops into adult worms. The
classical symptoms of a fully developed infection is bloody sputum in
which Paragonimus eggs can be demonstrated, and Paragonimus is,
therefore, an important differential diagnosis to tuberculosis. In
the migratory phase, elevated eosinophils and IgE are common.
Diagnosis can be aided by detection of specific antibodies. The
treatment of choice is praziquantel. - Mod.EP]
