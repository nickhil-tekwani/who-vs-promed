The Friedrich Loeffler Institute (FLI) today [20 Oct 2020] confirmed another case of African swine fever [ASF] in wild boar in Brandenburg. This increases the current number of cases in Germany to 71. The carcass was found within the 1st core area near Neuzelle in the Oder-Spree district.

Domestic pig herds are still free of ASF.

Meanwhile, on the Oder island in Kustrin-Kietz, the supposedly infected group of boar, which was detected during drone flights about 2 weeks ago, has disappeared, Top Agrar reported. On the basis of the drone recordings, the animals were judged as sick or dead. At the end of last week, the wild boar disappeared on the fenced-in Oder island: Drone recordings had shown they could no longer be seen at the location where they had previously gathered. Yesterday [Mon 19 Oct 2020], the deputy district administrator Friedemann Hanke (CDU) could not confirm to the news portal RBB whether the animals are still on the island. It also remains unclear whether the wild boar on the Oder island were actually infected with ASF. However, according to RBB, the disappearance of the wild boar does not change the approach of the district.

Further drone flights allegedly show that there are still approximately 50 to 60 animals on the island, Hanke told RBB. The number of wild boar will now be massively reduced. At the end of last week, the affected district of Markisch-Oderland already erected a double electric fence around the Oder island, each approximately 6 km long. Feeding stations have been set up so that the animals can stay on the island. The next step is to use traps to catch and kill the wild boar. In addition, the district is planning to build a permanent fence around the entire core area in Markisch-Oderland. When the fence work will start or when it will be completed remains to be seen.

[Earlier information on ASF occurring on Oder island (20201011.7853586), based upon drone thermal photography (erroneously deciphered?) is currently, as indicated above, refuted. A reader of Top Agrar ironically commented: "Then wild boar zombies are running or swimming around somewhere."

The ASF event in the district Markisch-Oderland (Brandenburg) started on 29 Sep 2020 near the hamlet of Bleyen, about 2 km [1.24 miles] from the border with Poland, where a young boar (less than one year old) was shot in a corn field. This location is more than 50 km [31.1 miles] north of Germany's 1st cluster of ASF-infected wild boar, in Brandenburg's districts Oder-Spree and Spree-Neisse. The actual number (2) of officially confirmed ASF-infected wild boar in Markisch-Oderland (ASF Core area 2) remains unchanged.

These cases are presented in OIE's interactive map of ASF (worldwide) at https://tinyurl.com/yy49z8p7 (click to center on the German/Polish cluster; zoom repeatedly until 2 separate orange triangles, each presenting a case, become visible in the northern cluster).

Both cases can also be seen in the ASF interactive map of Pig Progress, at https://www.pigprogress.net/Health/African-Swine-Fever/ASF-Poland/?dossier=35415&widgetid=0. In this useful map, the boundaries of the 2 Core areas are presented; zooming in will lead to the very location of the 2 mentioned cases in Altbleyen (Old Bleyen), in the district Markisch-Oderland.

The German ASF event started on 7 Sep 2020. The 1st cluster (ASF Core area 1) counts now 69 confirmed cases, including animals that are estimated to have died several months ago. The disease was introduced by infected wild boar from western Poland. - Mod.AS
