Acute respiratory syndrome in Democratic Republic of the Congo - WHO Update 2
----------------------------------------------------
Cases of acute respiratory syndrome continue to be reported in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo (see previous report:
<http://www.who.int/disease-outbreak-news/n2002/december/12december2002.html>).
By 22 Nov 2002, an Influenza-like illness was reported in Djolu, Bosobolo,
Karawa, and Genema health areas in Equateur Province, with Bosobolo being
the most affected area.
Of 6 nasopharyngeal swabs from cases in Bosobolo which have been tested at
the Institute Pasteur, Paris (a partner in the Global Outbreak Alert and
Response Network <http://www.who.int/emc/global_outbreak_network.htm>), 4
have reacted strongly with influenza virus A/Panama/2007/99(H3N2) and
A/Chile/6416/01(H3N2), which are representative strains of the A/H3N2
influenza A virus currently circulating worldwide and closely related to
the vaccine strain. Further genetic identification of the virus is underway.
WHO and Medecins sans Frontieres (MSF- Belgium) continue to assist the
Ministry of Health with technical support and medicines.
