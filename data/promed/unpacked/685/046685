Private Tajik Dental Clinics Closed Following Hepatitis Scare
-------------------------------------------------------------
Dushanbe city council has closed down 12 private dental clinics after
residents claimed they had contracted hepatitis while undergoing
treatment there, RFE/RL's Tajik Service reports.

Holmuhammad Nazarov, deputy head of the State Sanitary Control
Service, told RFE/RL that the decision to inspect all private dental
clinics in the capital and several other districts was taken in
response to numerous such complaints.

Nazarov also told RFE/RL that the inspections brought to light many
violations of sanitary standards and regulations. "We were very
surprised to learn that dentists were using one and the same
instrument to extract the teeth of 20 patients, while regulations
require using separate disposable [sterilisable?] instruments for each
patient. Some of the dentists wore nail varnish, which is prohibited,"
Nazarov told RFE/RL. These clinics were closed last week.

A resident of Dushanbe told RFE/RL she contracted hepatitis virus
infection [B or C or both?] at a dental clinic in the capital in
February [2011]. "My life has turned into a nightmare since then, I
have spent a lot of money to treat the disease and contacted the
Health Ministry for help," she stated. She also said that in general
sanitary conditions in state-run dental clinics are poor.

[Dushanbe (formerly Stalinabad) is the capital and largest city
(population 700 000 approximately) of Tajikistan. It can be located
using the HelthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map of Tajikistan at:
http://healthmap.org/r/00Fa.

Hepatitis B virus and/or hepatitis C virus can cause lifelong
infection, leading to cirrhosis of the liver, liver cancer, liver
failure, and death. Hepatitis B and C viruses are transmitted through
activities that involve percutaneous or mucosal contact with
infectious blood or body fluids. The risk of transmission of
hepatitis B virus and/or hepatitis C virus from dentist to patient is
minimal unless there is exposure of the patient to blood or secretions
from the dentist, or there is transmission from patient to patient
through use of inadequately sterilised instruments. In the latter
situation transmission of human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] is an
additional hazard.

In the report from Dushanbe the evidence for transmission of hepatitis
disease is unclear, since symptoms would be slow to develop. It seems
unlikely that all dental clinics in Dushaanbe, private or state-run,
would be similarly negligent in infection control procedures. There is
no information on confirmation of the accusations by laboratory
diagnostics.

Further information would be appreciated concerning the details of
this incident, the identity of the virus (or viruses) transmitted, and
the treatment offered. Hepatitis C virus infection is treatable,
depending to some extent on the particular genotype of hepatitis C
virus transmitted, whereas hepatitis B virus, although preventable by
vaccination, is difficult to treat. - Mod.CP]
