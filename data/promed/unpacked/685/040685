A highly contagious livestock virus that causes lesions on horses and cattle has been detected in Utah, the Utah State Department of Agriculture and Food (UDAF) announced [Tue 5 May 2015].

Tests conducted by the National Veterinary Services Laboratories in Ames, Iowa, have confirmed the finding of Vesicular Stomatitis, or VS, on 1 mule in Kane County. 4 other horses are showing symptoms and are undergoing tests. An additional 9 horses may have had contact with the infected animals, the UDAF said in a news release.

Warren Hess, acting state veterinarian, has put all 14 animals on a mandatory quarantine.

The UDAF believes the virus was brought into the state by animals traveling from Arizona, one of several states where cases of VS recently have been confirmed.

The virus was discovered during the Mount Carmel XP horse endurance/trail event [Utah], which ran 29 Apr-3 May 2015. Participants in the event are encouraged to examine their animals for signs and report any signs to a local veterinarian or the UDAF at 801-538-4910.

"This is an early onset of VS cases," UDAF said in the release, "and horse owners are cautioned that VS may be very active this year."

If VS is detected, there is no specific treatment or cure in livestock.

The disease primarily affects cattle and horses, but occasionally swine, sheep, and goats. The lesions of VS are similar to those of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), which affects cloven-hoofed animals and was eradicated from the United States in 1929.

Humans can become infected with VS when handling affected animals, but this is rare. In people, VS causes influenza-like symptoms such as fever, muscle aches, headache, and malaise.

Many states, including Idaho, have applied interstate movement restrictions of various types to livestock to avoid the spread of VS.

The Idaho State Racing Commission and the Idaho State Department of Agriculture announced [Tue 5 May 2015] they are requiring "a certificate of veterinary inspection" before horses from infected states are allowed to attend races in Idaho.

This is not the 1st time Utah has seen cases of vesicular stomatitis. It was previously reported in 2005 and the mid 1980s.

Officials with the Idaho State Racing Commission have confirmed that several horses in Utah, New Mexico, and Arizona have tested positive for vesicular stomatitis virus.

All facilities with confirmed cases of the virus are in quarantine and under observation, but officials in Arizona are worried infected horses at a racetrack in that state are already on their way to racetracks elsewhere.

There are 2 strains of this virus, the New Jersey and the Indiana strains. I wonder which strain is involved in these outbreaks?
