[1] Kentucky (Christian County): LPAI H7N9
Date: Mon 20 Mar 2017

http://www.kyagr.com/Kentucky-AGNEWS/press-releases/Low-pathogenic-avian-influenza-detected-in-western-Kentucky.html


Federal and state authorities say a case of low pathogenic avian influenza has been detected in a commercial poultry flock in western Kentucky.

Kentucky State Veterinarian Robert C Stout said the National Veterinary Services Laboratory in Ames, Iowa, confirmed the presence of H7N9 low pathogenic avian influenza in samples taken from the Christian County premises.

The virus exposure at the premises was initially detected by the Murray State University Breathitt Veterinary Center in Hopkinsville while conducting a routine pre-slaughter test last week [week of 13 Mar 2017]. Dr Stout said there were no clinical signs of disease in the birds. The affected premises is under quarantine, and the flock of approximately 22 000 hens was depopulated as a precautionary measure, Dr Stout said.

"Dr Stout and his staff have extensive experience and expertise in animal disease control and eradication," Agriculture Commissioner Ryan Quarles said. "They have an excellent working relationship with the Kentucky Poultry Federation and the poultry industry. They are uniquely qualified to contain this outbreak so our domestic customers and international trading partners can remain confident in Kentucky poultry."

Low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) may cause no disease or mild illness. Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) can cause severe disease with high mortality.

The Office of the State Veterinarian (OSV) and its partners in the US Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (USDA APHIS) are conducting surveillance on flocks within a 6-mile [9.7 km] radius of the index farm, Dr Stout said. The company that operates the farm is conducting additional surveillance testing on other commercial facilities it operates within that area.

The OSV, an agency of the Kentucky Department of Agriculture, works with USDA APHIS, other government agencies, the University of Kentucky Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, the Murray State University Breathitt Veterinary Center, private veterinary practitioners, and producers to prevent and eradicate disease in Kentucky livestock and poultry.

Dr Stout encouraged poultry producers and all other bird owners to take biosecurity measures to prevent their birds from being infected with avian influenza or other bird diseases:
- keep your distance: isolate your birds from visitors and other birds.
- keep it clean: prevent germs from spreading by cleaning shoes, tools, and equipment;
- don't haul disease home: clean vehicles and cages;
- don't borrow from your neighbor: avoid sharing tools and equipment with neighbors;
- know the signs: watch for early signs to prevent the spread of disease.
- report sick birds: report unusual signs of disease or unexpected deaths to the Office of the Kentucky State Veterinarian at (502) 573-0282, option 3, or through USDA's toll-free number at 1-866-536-7593.

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website says that avian flu viruses do not normally infect humans. APHIS issued a reminder that the proper handling and cooking of poultry and eggs to an internal temperature of 165 deg F [74 deg C] kills bacteria and viruses.

Poultry and eggs generated an estimated USD 1.2 billion in cash receipts to Kentucky farmers in 2015, the Kentucky office of the National Agricultural Statistics Service reported. Kentucky farmers produced 307.7 million broilers and nearly 1.3 billion eggs in 2015.

Kentucky entry requirements are listed on the OSV website at http://kyagr.com/statevet.

[It is the season when avian influenza (AI) is upon us. We hope we do not see a return of this disease with the vengeance that we saw in 2014-15. But thus far, it is an active AI season and it is still young.

This article provides some good biosecurity measures whether the operation is a commercial raiser or a small raiser. Please be acutely a ware of this disease, practice strict biosecurity and keep a very close eye on your birds for any sign of illness. - Mod.TG

[2] Tennessee (Lincoln, Giles counties) LPAI H7N9, HPAI H7N9
Date: Mon 20 Mar 2017

A flock of chickens at a 2nd Lincoln County commercial poultry breeding operation have tested positive for avian influenza, according to the Tennessee Department of Agriculture.

Officials confirmed this particular strain of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) is the same that affected a commercial chicken flock earlier this month [March 2017] in Lincoln County (HPAI H7N9).

The 2 facilities are less than 2 miles [3.2 km] apart so operators had been closely monitoring and testing the birds.

It's the 3rd case of bird flu identified in Tennessee this month. On 8 Mar 2017 a flock in Giles County tested positive for low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI H7N9).

Officials stress that neither HPAI nor LPAI pose a risk to the food supply and none of the affected animals entered the food chain.

The Tennessee Department of Health confirms that the risk of a human becoming ill with avian influenza during poultry illness incidents is very low. Officials said they will continue monitoring commercial and backyard poultry for signs of influenza.

[Tennessee seems to have both the low pathogenic and the high pathogenic strains.

All bird owners, regardless of the size of the operation should be acutely aware of this disease and keep an extremely close watch on the birds for the slightest sign of illness. - Mod.TG

[3] Alabama: LPAI H7N9, suspected, RFI
Date: Tue 21 Mar 2017

http://www.al.com/business/index.ssf/2017/03/pickens_county_flock_tests_pos.html


In a statement from the Alabama Department of Agriculture and Industries, State Veterinarian Tony Frazier said a flock of chickens at a Pickens County commercial poultry breeding operation, and a backyard flock located in Madison County, have both tested positive for low pathogenic avian influenza, a less serious strain.

Last week [week of 13 Mar 2017], a sample collected from a guinea fowl at the TaCo-Bet Trade Day flea market in Scottsboro [Jackson County] also tested positive for low pathogenic H7N9 avian influenza.

The commercial company owning the Pickens County flock, which was not publicly identified, collected samples and submitted them to the Alabama Department of Agriculture and Industries State Diagnostic Laboratory in Auburn. The commercial flock was also placed under quarantine.

Those samples, suspected positive for avian influenza, were sent on to the USDA National Veterinary Services Laboratory in Ames, Iowa. Even though these are the less dangerous strains of bird flu, officials said control measures are being implemented as a precautionary measure.

Surveillance zones have been put in place surrounding the locations in both Pickens and Madison counties.

Officials say this suspected strain of avian influenza does not pose a risk to the food supply and no affected animals have entered the food chain.

Alabama poultry is still under a "stop movement" order to prevent the possible spread of bird flu, which was suspected in 3 counties last week. A "stop movement" is a ban on bringing chickens or any type of birds together for exhibition or sale, including at regional and county fairs, festivals, swap meets, live bird markets, auctions, and flea markets.

Officials are still awaiting results for tests at a breeder farm in Lauderdale County run by Aviagen, a large poultry producer with US offices in Huntsville.

In Lauderdale County, 15 000 chickens were killed to prevent the spread of bird flu. The entire backyard flock in Madison County was also depopulated at the owner's request.

On [Thu 16 Mar 2017], a commercial chicken breeding operation in Lincoln County, Tennessee, tested positive for avian influenza, the 3rd case in that state in 2 weeks.

Avian influenza is a catch-all phrase for respiratory viruses occurring naturally among wild aquatic birds worldwide, which can infect poultry and other bird and animal species, according to the Centers for Disease Control. Neither strain reported in the US this year [2017] is the same as the bird flu currently infecting China, where 161 people have died since October 2016. Those people were mostly exposed at outdoor poultry markets, according to the CDC.

[Any one owning birds should be on the alert for any sign of illness, no matter how small. These viruses travel quickly and generally have negative results on the flock.

Do not attend gatherings of birds such as trade days, shows, swaps, or fairs.

Quarantine new birds as well as any birds having illnesses.

Remember biosecurity includes shoes that could track back the virus and even your hands. Wash them frequently. - Mod.TG

More information on the type of LPAI virus is implicated in these outbreaks in Alabama would be appreciated. The media report says a week earlier, an isolate in a guinea fowl in Jackson county was LPAI H7N9, but does not give the specific type implicated in these 2 outbreaks (in Pickens and Madison counties). -Mod.MPP
