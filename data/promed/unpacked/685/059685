Japanese encephalitis detected in 30 NSW piggeries, pork supply set to plunge
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Experts say Japanese encephalitis will impact pork supply as infected piggeries experience production losses of up to 80%.

There are now 30 New South Wales piggeries affected by the mosquito-borne virus and 11 people have been infected, with 3 deaths nationwide.

Japanese encephalitis is endemic in other parts of the world, but it has never been seen this far south in Australia.

NSW Department of Primary Industries chief veterinary officer Sarah Britton said it had been a stressful time for pig producers.

"They have had huge impacts on production -- up to 60 to 80% of production impacted in some sites," she said.

"It's also the mental health impact on the people, because there's been a lot of stillborn or abortions or abnormalities in piglets ... which can be very stressful seeing ... day in, day out."

The disease has no impact on the safety of consuming pork, but Dr Britton said production losses were likely to affect availability.

"I think it will affect the supply of pork, because it has impacted a number of the bigger properties as well as some of the smaller ones," she said.

Dr Britton said cases of the disease had stabilised in recent weeks as mosquito activity reduced.

Australian Pork board member Edwina Beveridge, of Blantyre Farms, said her pigs recently tested positive.

"It generally doesn't affect our grower pigs," she said.

"But if a sow is bitten by a mosquito at the right -- or the wrong -- time in her gestation cycle it can affect her litter of piglets. We're just seeing on our farm some impacts in the piglets being born now, where we're having a lot more, unfortunately, that are born dead." Ms Beveridge said between three and 15% of a litter was usually impacted.

Vaccine in development
----------------------
One of the big questions for pig producers is whether the virus will return annually.

It is believed this outbreak may have been started by an infected waterbird flying further south than normal. "Is it because we've had so much water around and the waterbirds have come south?" Dr Britton said. "Or has a cyclone ... potentially blown mosquitoes down here?"

Dr Britton is part of the discussion as to how pig producers can be supported now and into the future, with vaccines a key focus.

Human vaccines are available, but none are approved for pigs in this country. Australian company Apiam Animal Health is hoping to solve this problem by developing a vaccine as part of its new viral vaccine laboratory, which will be located in Bendigo. The company has received $700 000 [USD 516 100] in funding from the Victorian government to build the facility and will work in conjunction with La Trobe University.

No pigs at show
---------------
The outbreak meant there were no pigs at the Sydney Royal Easter Show this year [2022], even in the farmyard nursery.

Royal Agricultural Society pig and alpaca committee chair Janie Forrest said it was very disappointing for the exhibitors who spent months preparing for the show. "In the interest of public health, when there's a large population travelling through our pavilion, we were advised to cancel the pig show," she said. "They're bred by a variety of breeders who absolutely love what they do, and so for that reason it was all the more heart-wrenching to ring these breeders up 3 weeks ago and advise them."

Ms Forrest said it was also disappointing for visitors to the show. "I listened to this lady trying to explain to their child, who was absolutely in tears because there were no pigs," Ms Forrest said. "I said, 'I promise you we'll have little pigs next year -- we'll do our very best.'"

Pig producers can contact the NSW Department of Primary Industries on 1800 675 888 for support and to report incidences of disease.

[Japanese encephalitis (JE) transmission continues to gradually affect more people and pigs but incidence may be slowing. The above report indicates that JE virus infection in pig production is economically serious with affected piggeries experiencing losses of up to 60-80%.

The integrated human and animal health response by the Australian government is commendable as a good example of a One Health approach to an emerging disease outbreak. Ongoing vaccination of people who are in areas of higher JE risk, particularly near affected piggeries where JE virus is being transmitted, is not mentioned above but is another active preventive response to the outbreak. - Mod.TY
