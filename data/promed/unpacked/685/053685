Rabies claimed another life in the city [Pune, Maharashtra state] on Tuesday [26 Aug 2014], taking the death toll this year to 18 so far.

The 45-year-old man from Daund taluka [Pune district, Maharashtra state] died at the Naidu Infectious Diseases Hospital on 26 Aug 2014. He was bitten by a dog on 14 Aug 2014. He did not take anti-rabies vaccine and fast-acting rabies antibodies on scheduled days which caused his death, said a civic official.

"[The patient] was admitted to Naidu Hospital after his condition deteriorated. He developed symptoms like fear of water, air and was extremely breathless at the time of admission. He died at 8:30 pm on [26 Aug 2014]," said S T Pardeshi, medical officer of health, PMC [Pune Municipal Corporation]. "[He] suffered a category III dog bite wound. As per the medical history produced by the victim's relatives, the man had not taken the anti-rabies vaccine on the scheduled days. He was also not administered rabies immunoglobulin, a ready-made antibody, which is extremely effective in deactivating the virus in category III dog-bite injury," the doctor who attended [the patient] said.

As per the World Health Organization, the incubation period for the infection is typically 1-3 months, but it may vary from a week to a year.

Rabies is a zoonotic disease (transmitted to humans from animals) that is caused by a virus. The disease affects domestic and wild animals, and is spread to people through close contact with infectious material, usually saliva, via bites or scratches.

According to the Association for Prevention and Control of Rabies in India, greater awareness about rabies and its timely treatment, combined with efforts to control the stray-dog population, pet-dog licensing, and annual anti-rabies vaccination of animals, are necessary to control the infection. Experts have highlighted the need to create awareness about proper wound care and post-exposure vaccination must be reinforced to prevent rabies infection.

[Another sad reminder of the need to take proper prompt action after being exposed to a rabid dog. I suspect that the folk memory of the multiple vaccine injections of yore puts people off. The reality is that modern vaccines are just uncomfortable, not painful.
