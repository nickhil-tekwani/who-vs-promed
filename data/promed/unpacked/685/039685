CALLING LITHUANIA & VANUATU

A ProMED-mail post
<http://www.promedmail.org>

Our only known subscribers in these 2 countries left us this week, without
any explanation. But some people have addresses ending in .org or .com
which do not show their location. If there is anybody in those 2 countries
still reading us, please let us know, because we want to ensure we have at
least one subscriber in every country
on Earth who can keep us informed of any new & unusual outbreak of
infectious disease there.
Also, if anyone reading this has e-mail contact with either of those
countries, please send them our website URL: www.promedmail.org & tell them
about us.
Many thanks in advance,
Jack
