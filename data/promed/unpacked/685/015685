ANTHRAX BIOTERRORISM: BACKGROUND & PERSPECTIVES

The bacterium that causes anthrax [disease], _Bacillus anthracis_, is found
naturally in the environment, has been used in laboratory experiments for
many years, and has been refined and genetically altered in biological
weapons research. The ability of anthrax to cause disease depends most on
the concentration of exposure, the method of delivery, and the organ
affected. The potency of an individual spore is little changed from nature
to the laboratory.
-- Natural anthrax:
In their natural state, anthrax spores are found in the soil throughout
Asia and Africa. In the U.S., [anthrax spores are] common in the rural
soils of Texas, Oklahoma, and the Mississippi Valley. It also is often a
contaminant in goat and other animal hides, and special measures are taken
to protect animal skin and wool workers.
Anthrax spores in nature clump together in particles too large to be
inhaled. This makes the natural spore a poor weapon.
-- Anthrax in the laboratory:
The bacillus has been used in scientific research for more than 100 years.
Robert Koch, a German bacteriologist, used anthrax to discover in 1877 the
basic principles of infectious disease. Many other scientists have used
anthrax in basic biological research.
-- Anthrax as a weapon:
Creating a weapon from anthrax requires that a large number of spores be
grown in the lab, purified, and then combined with a fine powdery substance
that keeps the spores from clumping. The powder also provides a vehicle
that helps keep the spores airborne as long as possible after they are
released.
To be effective as a weapon, the anthrax spores must remain airborne in
sufficient concentration to allow victims to inhale large numbers. At least
8000 spores, and perhaps many more than that, must be inhaled deep into the
lungs to cause disease. Studies have shown that goat mill workers routinely
exposed to more than 500 inhaled spores over an 8-hour period did not
develop disease.
Experts say that the individual anthrax spore is about one micron by one
micron in size. A human hair is 25 to 50 microns in diameter. Particles
that are 5 microns or bigger are usually trapped in the upper portions of
the respiratory tract. For this reason, to be an effective weapon, anthrax
spores are refined so that they are delivered to the respiratory tract in
particles small than 5 microns.

I've been following all the [bioterrorism] hysteria [reports] on
ProMED-mail. For a discussion of how we might help to simmer down the
ongoing hysteria here in the US, might I offer that in an attempt to place
these risks in perspective someone should put out comparative disease
incidence for diseases other than anthrax as communicated by letter.
I have seen a reference to foodborne disease incidence annual in the US as
76 million cases annually, with 315 000 hospitalizations and 5000
deaths. Also, about 100 people in the US are killed annually by
"lightning, lightning shock, stroke, or thunderbolt." An average of 300
people annually in the US die by "drowning, submersion in bathtub." And in
1991, 1247 people died by "inhalation or ingestion of food." (These latter
from CDC's National Center for Health Statistics.)
In other words, you are far more likely to die by taking a bath or eating
your dinner than by opening an anthrax-laced envelope.

The CDC and other authorities I think were put in a difficult situation in
making the recommendations for PEP [post-exposure prophylaxis] for _B.
anthracis_ in Florida. Drug sensitivities were not known at the time.
Clinical judgement is always needed to manage individual patients, yet
recommendations need to be made in a broad general public health context.
There are no human clinical data for prophylaxis.
My understanding is that most of the authoritative recommendations out
there are being based on the high-level Consensus Statement on Anthrax as a
Biological Weapon published in JAMA 1999;281:1735-45:
<http://jama.ama-assn.org/issues/v281n18/fpdf/jst80027.pdf>
In Table 3 Cipro[floxacin] is recommended as Initial Therapy (prophylaxis)
of choice
when sensitivities are unknown. Then Optimal Therapy if Strain is Proven
Susceptible is a choice of Amoxi[cillin] or Doxy[cycline] for 60d. The
choice of drugs for
Pregnancy and Children follow the same considerations except that
Doxy[cycline] is
not recommended at all in either case. A footnote adds that in vitro data
indicate that ofloxacin 400 q12h or levofloxacin 500 q24 can be
substituted. [The latter are fluoroquinolones similar to ciprofloxacin in
structure and mechanism of action. These recommendations may speak to
potential problems with adequacy of supplies of ciprofloxacin that have
been raised by the news media. - Mod.ES]

Anthrax: What Every Clinician Should Know
Live Broadcast: 18 Oct 2001, 4:00 - 5:30 PM EDT
This live satellite and web broadcast will present clinical guidelines and
procedures for the early recognition, diagnosis, treatment, and reporting
of anthrax exposure. A panel of experts from the CDC will provide an
overview of clinical, laboratory, and public health preparedness for
potential _Bacillus anthracis_ incidence. A toll-free audio line is also
available for those unable to arrange a viewing location. Sponsored by the
American Hospital Assn., American Medical Assn., Public Health Training
Network, CDC, and the University of North Carolina School of Public Health.
For full details including satellite technical specifications and
fax/call-in numbers for Q&A during the program, refer to the Acrobat Reader
(PDF) flyer at

A link to the web cast will be provided on the day of the broadcast at:

CDC PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS & RESPONSE
<http://www.bt.cdc.gov/>
Contains bioterrorism fact sheets, guidelines, notification protocols,
news, Frequently Asked Questions, links, and more. Includes information
about CDC roles and national programs such as the National Pharmaceutical
Stockpile and the Health Alert Network.

[I have received a series of messages concerning the probability of finding
_B.anthracis_ spores in random nasal swabs or seropositive individuals in a
large random survey. It would be extraordinary to find anything except
false positives unless one included workers in wool mills or bone meal
plants, and particularly when they handled imported wool and bones, or
farm/ranch workers in Texas, Nevada, or the upper Mid-West, where we still
see livestock cases.
Domestically the pathogen is limited to very few areas, and I have yet to
find a clinical veterinarian from these places who has ever been
vaccinated. Our colleague Jack Woodall suggested that anthrax might be
found in veterinary schools/colleges, but frankly they don't see cases
except by accident, as in Oklahoma a few years ago, when an "interesting"
dead sheep was brought into the college's necropsy facility.
The director of my own laboratory swabs the lab down herself with 5%
Chlorox each Friday and after any procedure. We offer visiting scientists
swabs and blood agar plates and make the offer of a free dinner anywhere in
town if (s)he finds any viable organisms. We haven't had to do that for
some years now. I cannot speak for others' laboratories. - Mod.MHJ]
