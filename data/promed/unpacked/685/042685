A mass outbreak of food poisoning has occurred in the oblast of
Jalalabad, in the village of Toktogul.
The meat of a slaughtered cow was distributed among 25 families of
the village, as a result of which, after several hours, people began
to be admitted to the infectious diseases hospital with food
poisoning. People continued reporting to the hospital for 3 days, and
presently 13 people have been identified with food poisoning and 35
people identified as their contacts.
