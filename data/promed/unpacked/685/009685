POLIOMYELITIS - WORLDWIDE (19): KENYA EX SOMALIA
***************************************
A ProMED-mail post

Date: 26 Dec 2006
From: Dr. S. K. Sharif <sksharif@africaonline.co.ke>

A 2nd case of polio has been confirmed in Hagadera Refugee Camp in
Dadaab Division, Garissa District, North Eastern Province, Kenya.
The patient, a 13-year-old female refugee from Somalia, presented on
13 Nov 2006 with acute flaccid paralysis. Stool samples from the
patient were taken to Kenya Medical Research Institute and later sent
to South Africa for confirmation. The results were received on 17 Dec
2006 confirming wild poliovirus type 1.
This is the 2nd positive case from the same camp. The 1st positive
case was in September [2006] in a 3-year-old girl [see prior
ProMED-mail postings listed below: Poliomyelitis - Worldwide (14) &
(15): Kenya ex Somalia. - Mod.MPP].
There has been an influx of refugees into North Eastern Kenya from
Somalia and there have been severe floods which have rendered parts
of the area inaccessible as well as destroying the sanitation
facilities in the camp and surrounding areas.

[ProMED-mail would like to thank Dr. Sharif for this report on the
confirmation of the 2nd paralytic polio case in Kenya. As mentioned
in the moderator comments on the prior posting on the 1st confirmed
case of paralytic polio (see prior ProMED-mail postings below:
Poliomyelitis - Worldwide (14) & (15): Kenya ex Somalia. Kenya has
not had local transmission of wild poliovirus (WPV) since 1984, so
the appearance of a 2nd case, also without a history of direct travel
to an area with known wild poliovirus transmission, is disconcerting.
However, it is quite possible that the child had contact with someone
who recently traveled from Somalia, as the refugee camps in that
region have Somali and Sudanese refugees with a recent increase in
influx of Somali refugees. (For some background information on these
refugee camps, see
<http://www.refugeecamp.org/curriculum/task7/dadaab.htm>. A recent UN
relief web report on the influx of Somali refugees into Kenya can be
seen at
<http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/RWB.NSF/db900SID/LZEG-6UJKCG?OpenDocument>).
Further information on the 1st case identified WPV type 1,
genetically linked to a virus circulating in Kismayo, Somalia
originating in Nigeria. As this 2nd confirmed case is in the same
refugee camp as the 1st, it is highly likely that the WPV responsible
will be found to be genetically linked to the prior case as well.
According to the Polio eradication website, there have been 32
confirmed cases of WPV-associated polio in Somalia in 2006. The date
of most recent onset of a WPV-1 case was 5 Sep 2006, and the date of
most recent onset of a WPV-3 case was 6 Oct 2006.
A good map of Kenya with the above-mentioned areas of Garissa and
Hagadera can be seen at

A similar map of Somalia can be seen at

We await further epidemiologic information on this case, and results
of further laboratory analyses. - Mod.MPP]
