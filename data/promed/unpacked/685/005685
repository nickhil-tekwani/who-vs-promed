Within the past month, 68 cases of _Cyclospora_ have been reported across the state, including in Fort Bend and Harris counties.

Experts said it's contracted by eating food or water contaminated with the microscopic parasite.

Past outbreaks have been linked to imported fresh produce, including pre-packaged salad mix, raspberries, basil, snow peas and mesclun greens. Health experts say the best way to keep your family safe is to thoroughly wash all fresh produce.

Symptoms of _Cyclospora_ are described as diarrhea lasting for a few days to a few months, loss of appetite, fatigue, weight loss and abdominal cramps. Anyone who suspects they have these symptoms should contact their health care provider for treatment.

[There is an ongoing outbreak of cyclosporiasis in Ontario and Britsih Columbia, Canada, (see ProMed below from the 3 and 16 Jul 2017; post 20170703.5146527 and 20170716.5177711 respectively).

Previous outbreaks have often been reported concomitantly in the United States and Canada. When the source has been identified, it has been lettuce and other vegetable products from Mexico, and US and Canadian retailers most probably import food items from the same manufacturers. It is noteworthy that an outbreak in Mexico has also been reported recently (see ProMED 20170708.5159937). - Mod.EP
