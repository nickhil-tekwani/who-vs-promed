A bison has died from rabies at a Colorado State University research facility in Fort Collins.

Larimer County officials said Friday that public health and veterinary experts believe the infected bison likely came into contact with a rabid skunk or possibly a fox or other wild animal with rabies.

The bison died at an outdoor pen at CSU's Foothills Campus on 21 June 2012. The animal was part of a breeding project.

A news release from the health department says 2 other bison have also died, but it wasn't clear whether rabies was the cause. Health officials didn't immediately return a call.

The health department says CSU is taking steps to vaccinate the rest of the herd.

[Rabies is a fatal disease. If this animal was part of a breeding program, then students may have been involved in handling the animal at the nearby veterinary school. Likely health department officials are trying to determine how many people may have come into contact with the animal and need post exposure prophylaxis.
