Now that we've entered autumn, disease outbreaks can't be ignored. We have heard from the Jinzhou area of Liaoning province that there is a relatively high incidence of foot and mouth disease (FMD), and the area of the outbreak is expanding quickly. Breeders have a strong desire to sell. It is worth noting that incidence of FMD increases significantly as the weather cools. We hope that breeders will pay attention and guard their pigs' health -- after all, pigs are the path to wealth.

[Confirmation of the above information on the increased incidence of FMD in porcines in the Jinzhou area in China's Liaoning province Liaoning, and -- in case confirmed -- results of the causative agent's serotyping, will be appreciated. A map of Liaoning, where Jinzhou can be seen, is available at http://tinyurl.com/nazculn. - Mod.AS
