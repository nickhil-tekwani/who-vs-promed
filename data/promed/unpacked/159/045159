A species of mosquito that can carry the Zika virus, dengue, yellow fever and chikungunya [viruses] has been identified in Nebraska for the 1st time, according to state health officials.

On Tuesday [10 Sep 2019], the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) said it had documented _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes -- which are mainly found in tropical climates -- in York County, to the state's southeast.

The mosquitoes were captured during an annual research mission -- conducted by the DHHS and local collaborators -- aimed at monitoring the number of mosquitoes that can transmit West Nile virus in the state.

While _Ae. aegypti_ can carry tropical diseases, health officials stress that the risk of transmission in Nebraska remains low.

"_Ae. aegypti_ can carry and transmit various diseases that can have serious health consequences like Zika virus, chikungunya, dengue and yellow fever, and that is of concern to public health officials," Tom Safranek, State Epidemiologist for the DHHS, said in a statement.

"However, the transmission of these pathogens would require a person currently infected with such a disease to be bitten by an _Ae. aegypti_ mosquito and then that mosquito would need to bite another uninfected person. The risk of these infections to local residents is low but also dependent on the presence or arrival of an infected individual in the area," he said.

According to health officials, _Ae. aegypti_ -- which has a flying range of about 500 feet -- tends to feed in the daytime and has a preference for biting humans. Only the females feast on blood, which they use to provide their eggs with nutrients as they mature.

The species originated in the tropical regions of Africa. However, it is now considered to be one of the most widespread mosquitoes, taking up residence in [tropical], subtropical and temperate regions around the world. As the world warms in the face of climate change, the species' range is only expected to extend further northwards and southwards.

"This discovery underscores the importance of our mosquito trapping system," Safranek said. "Tracking and monitoring the types of mosquitoes that exist in Nebraska communities is critical, which in turn helps us identify potential public health implications and implement prevention measures to reduce risk."

The mosquitoes have not yet been tested to see whether they are carrying the viruses that cause these diseases, according to health officials.

The Moab Mosquito Abatement District (MADD) said it discovered a new species of mosquito in Grand County. MADD officials are asking the public to help as they work to combat this "invasive species."

The new species of mosquito has been named _Aedes aegypti_ (pronounced: A'-deez uh jip' tie). The common name [is] the yellow fever mosquito, according to MADD. The insect is reportedly a carrier of Zika virus, yellow fever, dengue fever and so on.

Officials say this species prefers to lay its eggs in urban or suburban "micro-habitats." Examples of micro-habitats in Moab:

- Outdoor plants with pans under them that collect water
- Leaky swamp coolers (yes, up in the roof pans too)
- Scummy chicken water/animal water
- Water that could collect in trash or garbage

Here is how MADD says the public can help:

- Drain or dump any and all standing water on your property.
- If you need to provide water for your animals, do your best to empty every day and refill.
- If you need help, ask a neighbor, a friend, a relative and search the entire property of your entire property for any standing water and dump it.

[This is the 1st time that reports of _Ae. aegypti_ mosquitoes in Nebraska and Utah have been posted on ProMED-mail. It seems unlikely that this mosquito will become established in either location, However, the CDC map showing the states where this mosquito is very unlikely, unlikely, likely or very likely to become established, shows Nebraska as very unlikely. In Utah, the only area depicted as likely is the far southwest corner of the state in Washington County, far from Moab. Moab is in an area shown as very unlikely (see https://www.cdc.gov/zika/vector/range.html). Very low _Ae. aegypti_ populations in either state make the probability of ongoing transmission of Zika, dengue or chikungunya viruses very low should a viremic individual come into the areas where the mosquitoes were collected. Ongoing mosquito surveillance is wise, to be sure that new introductions of this mosquito do not occur, especially in Moab, in southern Utah. The mosquito has been found in the nearby states of California, New Mexico and Arizona. - Mod.TY
