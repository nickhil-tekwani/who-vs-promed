WEST NILE-LIKE VIRUS: PCR PRIMERS & PROTOCOLS
************************************************

Several groups have written requesting sequences of primers and
protocols suitable for RT-PCR amplification of the flavivirus recently
implicated in the New York city encephalitis outbreak (see Briese et al.
Identification of a Kunjin/West Nile-like flavivirus in brains of patients
with New York Encephalitis Lancet 354, 1261). ProMED has graciously
agreed to help disseminate this information.
The primers and protocols we employ have been tested independently
by several investigators using various clinical materials. These
protocols are a work in progress; thus, in the event you have difficulties
or wish to suggest modifications please feel free to contact either
Thomas Briese (tbriese@uci.edu) or Ian Lipkin (tbriese@uci.edu).
Protocol:
1) RT: SuperScript II RNase-minus Reverse Transcriptase (Life
technologies Cat # 18064-014) with 4 ug total RNA/ 20 ul assay and
random hexamers at 14 pmol/ul final conc. We recommend using the
Gibco protocol. RNA is incubated together with hexamer primer for 70
C for 10 min and quick chilled on ice before addition of reaction mix
(buffer, dNTP, DTT, and RT). The RT reaction is performed for 10 min
at 25 C and then 50 min at 42 C. The reaction is stopped at 70 C for 15
min. Thereafter RNase H is added and incubated for 10 min at 37 C.
2) PCR: We use a 25 ul assay volume containing 1.5 ul of the cDNA
reaction, primers at 1.5 uM final conc., 2 mM MgCl2 final conc., and
Promega Taq Cat# M166A in the supplied reaction buffer. PCR is
performed on a MJ PTC 200 thermocycler - 3 min. 94 C, then 40 cycles
of 1 min 94 C, 1 min. 50 C, 1 min. 72 C, final extension for 10 min. at
72 C.
Some investigators have found additional amplification products using
the method described above. This may be obviated by annealing at 56
C (instead of 50C).
Primer set B (NS3, approx. 470bp product)
Fla-U5004
5' - GGA ACD TCM GGH TCN CCH AT-20-mer
Fla-L5457
5' - GTG AAR TGD GCY TCR TCC AT-20-mer
Primer set C (5' NS5, approx. 200bp product):
Fla-U9093
5' - AGY MGR GCH ATH TGG TWY ATG TGG-24-mer
Fla-L9279
5' - TCC CAV CCD GCK GTR TCA TC-20-mer
Primer set D (3' NS5, approx. 170bp product):
Fla-U9954
5' - GSS AAA KCH TAY GCN CAV ATG TGG-24-mer
Fla-L10098
5' - AGC ATR TCT TCH GTN GTC ATC CA-23-mer
Primer set E (3' untranslated region, approx. 670/750 bp products):
Fla-U10098
5' - TGG ATG ACN ACD GAA GAY ATG CT-23-mer
Fla-L10750
5' - GGG GTC TCC TMT AAC CWC TAG-21-mer
Note: Primer Set "A" does not work for the New York isolate.
A Taqman system has also been established; however, specificity
analyses have not been completed because we lack cDNAs with which
to generate NS3 and NS5 transcripts of St. Louis encephalitis, West Nile
and Kunjin viruses. We would be most grateful for access to such
cDNAs for use in calibrating and assessing specificity, and would be
pleased to acknowledge the contributions of these reagents.
