Investigators admit the cause of the outbreak may never be known. A
fatal outbreak of Legionnaires' disease in the south Wales valleys may
have been caused by "very unusual climatic conditions," officials say.
An 85-year-old man and a woman of 49 died, and 22 people needed
hospital treatment after the 2010 outbreak.

No single source was identified for cases in the Cynon Valley, Merthyr
Tydfil and Rhymney Valley areas. Dr Gwen Lowe, of Public Health Wales,
said European research backed what began as a "purely speculative
theory."

An investigation into the outbreak found 4 cooling towers tested
positive for the _Legionella_ bacterium but no single source was
identified. The Public Health Wales' Outbreak Control Team report
found some cases were linked to commercial and retail premises outside
the affected areas, while an unregistered cooling tower in Merthyr
Tydfil, which came under suspicion, tested negative.

The outbreak, which became known as the Heads of the Valleys outbreak,
began on 3 Sep 2010 and went on until 12 Oct [2010]. It centred on a
corridor 12km (7.5 miles) either side of the Heads of the Valleys road
between Abergavenny in Monmouthshire and Llandarcy in Neath Port
Talbot. A number of people living and working in that area reported
flu-like symptoms, in some cases chest pain and vomiting, with the
symptoms worsening over the course of a week.

A mother-of-2, age 49, from Rhymney in Caerphilly County, became one
of 2 cases linked to the outbreak when she died in hospital on 12 Sep
2011. An 85-year-old man's death was also linked. 10 further people
with the disease were investigated but their cases were not found to
be linked; 2 of these patients -- a 70-year-old man and a 64-year-old
woman -- died.

The outbreak control team included representatives from 8 local
authorities, 2 local health boards, the Health and Safety Executive
and Environment Agency Wales. At the time Public Health Wales
described it as a very complex outbreak. Their report said it was
extremely complex to investigate. More than 200 workplaces and other
sites were sampled for the _Legionella_ bacterium. The 58-page report
called for more guidance on taking samples and collaboration between
organisations tackling any future outbreak. It said unregistered
cooling towers "remain a problem in outbreaks" and called for councils
to maintain their registers of these buildings.

Dr Lowe said only one case out of the 22 could be linked in
microbiological terms to a specific source. She told Radio Wales that
the theory about weather conditions might go some way to explaining
the unusually high number of cases in a specific area. The climatic
conditions at the time may have caused an overgrowth of bacteria in
the area, infecting more and more people, she said. More weight had
been given to it in light of research from the Netherlands, which
showed that a spike in the number of cases can occur under certain
climatic conditions, she said.

In 2008, a study by the UK Health Protection Agency found that there
appeared to be an increase in cases of Legionnaires' disease following
warm, humid periods.

[This is the final report on the Legionnaires' disease outbreak that
occurred in South Wales last year [2010] (see ProMED-mail post
Legionellosis, fatal - UK (03): (Wales) 20101014.3725). The outbreak
involved a total of 22 people. _Legionella pneumophila_, the cause of
Legionnaires' disease, was grown from clinical specimens in only 7 of
the 22 patients. Genotyping the _L. pneumophila_ isolated from
patients and environmental samples is done to help identify
environmental sources giving rise to cases; however, in this outbreak
each of the patient isolates was genetically distinct, which suggests
that there was no common source at least for these 7 patients. The
news release above says that 4 cooling towers tested positive for the
_Legionella_, but only one case out of the 7 culture-positive cases
could be linked in "microbiological terms" to these 4 culture-positive
cooling towers. The news release does not specify if by
"microbiological terms" they mean genotyping.

outbreak occurred is available at
