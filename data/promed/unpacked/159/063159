Grade / Date notified to WHO / Start of reporting period / End of reporting period / Total cases / Cases Confirmed / Deaths / CFR
Ungraded / 3 Dec 2019 / 3 Nov 2019 / 3 Dec 2019 / 3 / 3 / 1 / 33.30%

On 3 Dec 2019, WHO was informed through internal communication of 3 yellow fever cases in Mali, including one death. Of these, 2 of the cases are from Wogouna and Keregoura villages, Bougoni district, Sikasso region in the South of Mali and one from Nanakenieba village, Kati district, Koulikoro region in the south west of Mali.

The reported cases are young adults (15-25 years), one female and 2 males, with onset of symptoms in early November 2019.

The cases tested yellow fever IgM and PCR positive at Institute Pasteur Dakar on 3 Dec 2019.

The vaccination status of the cases is being investigated (2 of the cases reported vaccination in the past). The latest vaccination campaign in the country was performed in 2008 including the affected areas where the vaccination coverage was reported to be between 50 and 9% in 2008. The average national vaccination coverage for 2017 has been reported at 65% (data from Imperial College). The YF routine vaccination in the country was introduced in 2002.

A field investigation is ongoing. According to historical data, 10 cases were detected in Mali in 2015.

[This report provides some additional details in that 2 patients were male and one female along with their vaccination status, which were not included in the original post (see Yellow fever - Africa (25): Mali (BA, SK), Cote d'Ivoire 20191207.6827680). As in the original report, no mention is made of plans to vaccinate in the localities where the cases became infected. Vaccination in those areas is an effective preventive measure especially since, as the report notes, the mosquito vector, _Aedes aegypti_, is abundant enough to transmit dengue viruses. Yellow fever can spread rapidly and quickly get out of hand in susceptible populations with abundant mosquito vectors, as it did in Angola in 2016. - Mod.TY
