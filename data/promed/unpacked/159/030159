From: Niall Byrne <niallb@bigpond.com>

I suspect the quote that "[rabbit haemorrhagic disease has spread to 40
countries since it was first reported in China in 1984," is based on
Australian newsletters written some three years ago.
At that time RHD had been reported by 40 OIE member nations. The source
material did not (then) include Australia, NZ nor any non-member nations.
A copy of the list is at <http://www.csiro.au/communication/rabbits/qa5.htm>
