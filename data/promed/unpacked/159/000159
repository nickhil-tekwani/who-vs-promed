A wildlife conservation group is raising an alarm about a spate of
dying ducks in Calgary.
Volunteers from the Alberta Institute for Wildlife Conservation found
65 dead mallards near Nose Creek and Country Hills Boulevard, in
northwest Calgary, Monday [19 Feb 2007].
Institute spokesperson Robin Roper said reports have been received of
at least 3 more dead ducks at different points along the Bow River.
Roper said it's unlikely to be the H5N1 bird flu that has the World
Health Organization concerned. "It could definitely be a bird flu,
but not the highly pathogenic form that could potentially have the
possibility of passing to people if the virus mutated," Roper said.
The duck carcasses have been given to the Canadian Food Inspection
Agency [CFIA] for post-mortem examinations. The tissue samples will
be sent to [CFIA's] laboratory in Winnipeg (Manitoba) for analysis
and the results should be available by early next week [week of 25
Feb 2007], spokesman Jim Clark said.
Clark said it is unlikely the H5N1 virus was the cause of death
because a recent survey of Canadian wild birds hasn't turned up the
disease and yearly bird migrations haven't begun yet. "Since there
has been no contact at this time of year [with] either European or
Asian migrant birds, introducing that virus into our wild bird
population is extremely unlikely."
