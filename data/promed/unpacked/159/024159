[In the recent posting "Foot & mouth disease - Kazakhstan: (WK) bovine, susp, RFI 20160717.4350687", we included the (machine-translated) text of a report in the Kazakh website 'Oral Oniri' dated 16 Jul 2016, addressing a press conference with Adil Zholamanov, governor of Akzhaik District. The commentary was concluded by the following moderator's footnote: "In case the above machine translation includes significant inaccuracies, their correction by Kazakh readers will be gratefully welcomed." We are indeed grateful to a Kazakh subscriber who has kindly provided us with the following translation of the essential part of the Q&A report. - Mod.AS]

Question. Klara Kambetova, "Kazakstan-Oral" TV channel:
"1st question: we are informed that in June this year [2016] in the Akzhaik region an animal disease outbreak was reported. Are there any results on the study of this issue and what activities were undertaken to prevent the disease spread?"

Answer. Adil Zholamanov:
"On [17 Jun 2016], 10-15 sick cattle were reported in one day in Chapayev village of the Neftebaza district.

The information about foot-and-mouth disease was distributed to all mass media. We undertook all necessary security activities. So, any movement was restricted, and prevention measures such as cattle vaccination undertaken. Samples for pathology testing were sent to the regional veterinary laboratory. The same materials were sent to Astana as well. The results were received recently. The results did not confirm FMD or pasteurellosis. It was IBR [infectious bovine rhinotracheitis] positive. This does not affect humans. Therefore, cattle with this disease can be slaughtered and sent to markets. Overall 40 cows got sick and 7 to 8 calves died."

[The FMD-suspected event above is located in the region of West Kazakhstan, which is one of Kazakhstan's 9 regions included in the OIE-accredited "FMD-free zone where vaccination is not practised." For the accreditation details, see http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=20520 and a map at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Animal_Health_in_the_World/map/A_Kazakhstan.jpg.

In a map, presented by Kazakhstan during an April 2016 FAO meeting in Bishkek, the remaining regions were signed as "FMD-free zone where vaccination is practiced." This is to be regarded as a self-declared status. The map can be seen in slide 3 of the presentation at http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/user_upload/eufmd/Roadmap_2016/2-8_Kazakhstan_en.pdf.

The significance of IBR in the described event is rather debatable. To maintain the OIE-accredited "FMD-free zone where vaccination is not practised" status, Kazakhstan is expected to submit samples from the suspected animals for final confirmation to an OIE reference laboratory. The reference laboratory for Kazakhstan is likely to be ARRIAH (Vladimir, Russia). Results of the tests will be appreciated.

Notably, Kazakhstan has submitted today (Fri 22 Jul 2016) an immediate notification to the OIE on the diagnosis of the 1st outbreak of lumpy skin disease (LSD) in cattle within its territory , namely in Makasch, Kurmangazy, Mangyshlak. The Mangyshlak penninsula is situated within the Mangystau region, which borders Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. It is located in western Kazakhstan, south of the regions of West Kazakhstan and Atyrau, and similarly declared an FMD-free region without vaccination.

According to today's (22 Jul 2016) notification, the LSD outbreak in Angyshlak started on 7 Jul 2016 and was confirmed 21 Jul 2016. The diagnosis was "clinical" (no laboratory results included). Out of 3557 susceptible cattle, there were 459 cases of which 34 died. The notification, with map, is available at
http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=20520.

On top of the seriousness of the appearance of LSD in such a remote location, within a region declared free of FMD without vaccination, the said information requires adding LSD to the differential diagnosis of the recent event(s) in the region West Kazakhstan. - Mod.AS
