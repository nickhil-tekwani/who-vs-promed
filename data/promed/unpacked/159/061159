Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) was first described in 1993 in the
southwestern United States. HPS is a respiratory illness associated with
the inhalation of aerosolized rodent excreta (urine and feces) contaminated
by hantavirus particles. Four hantavirus species have been implicated as
etiological agents of HPS in North America(1). One species, Sin Nombre
virus, has been associated with the largest proportion of HPS cases. Its
primary reservoir is the deer mouse, _Peromyscus maniculatus_.
Person-to-person transmission of HPS has not been documented in North
America.
Upon inhalation of hantavirus contaminated excreta, an extensive infection
of pulmonary endothelial cells occurs and a viremic phase is initiated.
After an incubation period of 9 to 35 days, individuals usually experience
fever, chills, occasional headaches, and sometimes gastrointestinal
symptoms. Five days after the onset of initial symptoms, cough and
shortness of breath typically develop; pulmonary edema and deterioration of
cardiopulmonary function may then rapidly occur over the ensuing 24 hours.
There is no proven effective antiviral therapy for HPS although clinical
trials with ribavirin are in progress. Clinical management depends on
careful fluid administration and ventilatory support.
Canada has adopted the HPS case definition that was initially developed by
the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and
recommended by the Pan American Health Organization(1). A confirmed case is
a person with clinical illness and laboratory confirmation of infection.
Clinical illness is characterized by a febrile illness (greater than 38.3°
C) with bilateral diffuse interstitial edema that may radiographically
resemble acute respiratory distress syndrome and with respiratory
compromise requiring supplemental oxygen and developing within 72 hours of
hospitalization. Laboratory criteria for diagnosis includes any of the
following: presence of hantavirus-specific IgM or a fourfold or greater
increase in IgG antibody titres, positive reverse transcriptase-polymerase
chain reaction (RT-PCR) amplification of viral RNA, and positive
immunohistochemical results for hantavirus antigen in a patient's tissue.
Although HPS was made a nationally notifiable disease as of 1 Jan 2000,
provincial and territorial public-health authorities have previously
reported confirmed cases. The first case of HPS recognized in Canada during
active surveillance was in 1994 in British Columbia. Subsequently cases
have been identified retrospectively with the earliest case dating back to
1989 in Alberta. As of 31 December 1999, 32 laboratory-confirmed cases have
been reported in Canada with a case fatality rate of 38% (12/32). The
average age of HPS cases has been 39 years (range: 15 to 62 years). The
majority of cases (19/32, 60%) have been male. Cases have only been
reported from western Canada. The majority of these have been reported from
Alberta (20) with most originating in clusters southeast and northwest of
Edmonton. Remaining cases have been reported from British Columbia (6),
Saskatchewan (5), and Manitoba (1). The geographical distribution of
Canadian HPS cases is similar to that in the United States where less
densely populated western regions have experienced the greatest burden of
disease. Since 1994 when active surveillance for HPS was initiated in
Canada, the number of cases per year has fluctuated from a high of eight in
1994 to two in 1999. Yearly fluctuation in cases may reflect the
occurrence of higher population densities of infected rodents due to mild
winters and increased breeding capacity(2). The increased prevalence of
mice may lead to increased opportunities for human exposure to rodents and
their excreta, and hence a higher risk of transmission of hantavirus
infection to humans.
HPS cases in Canada have occurred in every month but March, with an
apparent bimodal seasonal distribution of cases corresponding to the spring
and late fall: 50% of the cases (16/32) occurred during the months of
April, May and June... Although the reasons for the seasonal pattern of HPS
are unclear, it is possible that a combination of human activity, rodent
behavior, and ecologic factors may be responsible.
In Canada, the ubiquitous deer mouse is the primary reservoir for Sin
Nombre viruses. Seroprevalence and RT-PCR amplification studies carried out
on over 6000 rodents have documented the presence of hantavirus infected
mice in every province except Prince Edward Island and Nova Scotia.
Seropositive mice have also been found in the Yukon, but not in the
Northwest Territories and Nunavut to date. However, only limited numbers of
deer mice from Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, and the Northwest
Territories have been tested; the possible occurrence of hantavirus
infected mice in these areas cannot be excluded. Furthermore, the sampling
of rodents for testing has been done by convenience and not systematically.
The distribution of infected mice is discontinuous; some localities show no
evidence of seropositive mice, whereas mice examined at various other trap
sites within the same province exhibit more than 30% seroprevalence.
Further rodent surveillance is necessary to give a more complete picture of
deer mouse seroprevalence throughout Canada.
Ongoing studies are being carried out to determine the prevalence of
hantavirus in Canadian rodents other than deer mice. Recent serosurveys of
Canadian meadow voles have shown that these rodents can also harbour
hantaviruses. RT-PCR amplification and sequencing analysis of a hantavirus
that infected a meadow vole in Ontario showed this virus to be related to
Prospect Hill virus (Dr. M. Drebot: unpublished observations). This viral
species has not been associated with human disease to date(1).
Recent studies have shown a significant degree of genetic diversity among
Sin Nombre-related hantaviruses across Canada(3). Regional genetic
variation among Sin Nombre-like viruses is a potential tool for carrying
out molecular epidemiologic studies that may pinpoint sites of human
exposure. The ability to identify mice carrying the strain of virus
associated with an HPS case may assist in distinguishing among multiple
sites of possible exposures. Molecular epidemiology may also improve our
understanding of the factors associated with hantavirus infection. Nucleic
acid sequencing of amplified hantavirus genome was carried out as part of
an investigation of the first HPS case ever reported from Manitoba in 1999.
Preliminary results have demonstrated genetic matches between the
hantavirus strain infecting this case and Sin Nombre-like viruses infecting
deer mice at sites near where the case lived.
Although cases of HPS have been confined to the western provinces, the
presence of infected mice in eastern Canada suggests that the potential for
HPS exists across the country. Prevention of this rare disease may be
achieved through education of the general public on the risks associated
with exposure to rodents and their excreta and adoption of appropriate
preventive practices(4). The combination of molecular epidemiology and
descriptive epidemiology of HPS in the human population and hantavirus
infection in the rodent populations shows promise as an approach to further
improve HPS risk assessment.
