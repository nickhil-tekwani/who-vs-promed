The unique computer tracing system which won Northern Ireland its exemption
from the UK beef ban has, according to agriculture chiefs, been hit by a
fault. A database error leading to 19 animals from farms which had a
history of BSE being allowed onto the European market through the Export
Certified Herds Scheme.
Department of Agriculture officials were cited as saying the error was
minor and had now been rectified. But Government sources revealed there
were fears it could damage fragile confidence in Ulster beef.
In a statement, a spokesman for the Department of Agriculture was quoted
as saying, "The animals concerned were all below 30 months of age and all
were eligible for consumption in the UK. However, we accepted the stringent
terms laid down by the Export Certified Herds Scheme and these included our
statutory obligation to notify the European Commission and Member States if
these are not met even in the case of one animal." The error was made in
the past 8 months and was under rigorous investigation. The spokesman said
none of the 19 animals involved were actually infected with BSE.
