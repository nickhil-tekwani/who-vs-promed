No case of bird flu detected in IRI
-------------------------------------
Head of Iran Veterinary Organization Hossein Hassani said Sunday [24
Dec 2006] no case of bird flu has been detected in Iran yet.
Hassani told IRNA that the Islamic Republic of Iran is still among
those states which are "clean of the bird flu virus" (H5N1).
Asked what the reason was behind the culling of chickens in some of
the chicken farms around the country, the official said that the
Veterinary Organization decided to immediately destroy any suspicious
case, since avian flu has been pandemic in some (neighboring) countries.
Hassani added that the culling of the suspicious cases does not
necessarily mean that a case of bird flu was found in the country. He
said there was no reason to feel concerned about the outbreak of the
disease in Islamic Republic of Iran.

[During February 2006, H5N1 was reportedly found to be the cause of
mortality in wild swans in 2 marshes (Selkeh and Espand) at Somaesara
(Anzali wetland), Gilan province, north Iran (see ProMED
20060214.0489). This was followed by an official notification of the
Iranian veterinary authorities to the OIE, published on 9 Feb 2006
(available at
<http://www.oie.int/eng/info/hebdo/AIS_32.HTM#Sec11>).
According to FAO's information (see ProMED 20060706.1859), subsequent
to the detection of cases in wild birds in mid-February [2006], the
authorities culled all 41 056 backyard and village poultry within a
2-km radius, and compensation was given to farmers. Active
surveillance of poultry farms was conducted, and samples from
domestic and wild birds were tested.
If avian influenza in chickens -- initially suspected and leading to
the recent culling of chickens in Iran -- has indeed been excluded,
there should be another cause for the alleged disease and, probably,
mortality. Information on the observed symptoms, laboratory tests
performed and their final results will be helpful. - Mod.AS]
