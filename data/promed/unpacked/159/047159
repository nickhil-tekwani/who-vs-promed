4 year old Ada girl dies of tick disease
----------------------------------------
A 4 year old girl from Ada, Oklahoma has died of Rocky Mountain spotted fever.
The state Health Department says the girl died April 30th from the disease
spread by ticks. She's the first Oklahoman to die of Rocky Mountain spotted
fever since 1994, although 3 people in the state died of other tickborne
diseases in 2003. Ticks can infect humans if they remain attached to the
body for 2 hours or more.
The disease can be treated with antibiotics if started within the first 4
or 5 days after onset of the illness. Public health officials say anyone
working, hiking, or camping in wooded or brush-filled areas should use a
tick repellent and examine themselves 2 or 3 times a day for ticks.

[Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF) is a tickborne disease caused by
_Rickettsia ricketsii_. It is most common in the south eastern US but is
also seen in Oklahoma and North Texas as well as New England and Long
Island and in other pockets throughout the Americas. The common tick
vectors are the dog tick (_Dermacentor variabilis_) and _D. andersonii_.
The disease can be fatal, particularly if the characteristic rash is absent
('spotless fever') leading to diagnostic delay. Prevention, by use of
insect repellents and prompt removal of ticks, is important in endemic
areas. - Mod.LM]
