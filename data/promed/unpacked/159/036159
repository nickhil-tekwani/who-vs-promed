Beijing to establish animal epidemic disease prevention center
--------------------------------------------------
Beijing will establish an animal epidemic disease prevention and
control center together with an animal disease information management
and early-warning system, sources with the municipal agriculture
bureau said on Sunday [1 May 2005].
The move is to strengthen the supervision over animal epidemics and
improve emergency handling abilities for any exotic animal epidemic
diseases, said an official of the bureau.
According to the official, Beijing will enhance the management for
animal epidemic prevention, improve the animal epidemic prevention
and supervision system, and integrate the veterinary technical
resources.
The city also plans to establish an animal quarantine farm and 2
isolation and disposal stations for sick animals or contaminated
animal products, while promoting experiments in chain distribution
for pesticides, improving the archive management for the use of
pesticides and animal remedies in plantations, and fish-breeding and
poultry-raising bases.
In Beijing today, several animal epidemic disease testing stations
have been established in the Beijing Zoo, Badaling Wild Animal World,
and other zoos.

[The general structure of the competent authorities dealing with
animal health issues in the People's Republic of China (PRC) as as
follows:
1. On the central level, there are 2 main entities:
a. The Ministry of Agriculture (MOA), comprising 4 principal bodies:
-The Bureau of Animal Husbandry and Health;
-The National General Station of Animal Husbandry and Health;
-The Animal Disease Monitoring Centre; and
-The National Institute for Veterinary Pharmaceutics Supervision.
b. The State General Administration of the PRC for Quality
Supervision and Inspection and Quarantine(AQSIQ).
2. On the regional and local levels, both of the above central
structures have their provincial, municipal and other branches.
Regarding these, the following information (dated 2001) could be
obtained from a report of an EU mission to China; see "DG
(SANCO)/3461/2001 - MR Final":
There are 31 provincial, 374 regional (prefecture level), and 1990
county level animal husbandry and health bureaus (hereafter referred
to as "regional veterinary authority" or "veterinary bureau") all
over the country. As a functional agent of the relevant local
government, the regional veterinary authority is located at the site
of the relevant government, and its personnel and financial affairs
are managed by that government. However, technical matters are
directed by the central veterinary authority.
Under their respective authority (and for technical issues under the
authority of the General Station of MOA), 31 provincial, 407
prefecture, 3117 county animal husbandry and veterinary stations have
been established. (Some prefectures and counties have more than one
veterinary station, smaller stations existing in the larger
townships.) The stations are equipped for diagnosis and surveillance,
animal health research, diagnostic and inspection services, and are
responsible for the prevention and quarantine of animal disease and
zoonoses, as well as the promotion and application of veterinary
diagnostic techniques. The term "quarantine" is often used by the
Chinese veterinary authorities to indicate not only quarantine at
import or export of live animals, but also in relation to inspections
and certification in relation to animal movements within the country
itself or in view of animal health supervision. Their budget mostly
depends on financial allocation from local/central government, but
also on charges for providing animal health care.
The Beijing changes might contribute to commendable improved
surveillance and reporting, hopefully to be followed by similar steps
in other regions of Greater China. - Mod.AS].
