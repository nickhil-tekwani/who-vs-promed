On 18 Oct 2007, the 1st case of _Clostridium difficile_ PCR ribotype
027-associated disease was detected in Finland. The strain was
isolated from a middle-aged male patient who died from a severe
pseudomembranous colitis. The patient had received antibiotics for a
urinary tract infection.

Epidemics of _C. difficile_-associated disease (CDAD) due to this
new, highly virulent strain have been recognized 1st in Canada and
the United States, and thereafter in Europe (1), including England
and Wales, Ireland, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, and France,
and has been detected in Austria, Scotland, Switzerland, Poland, and
Denmark (2).

In a retrospective survey performed in the Helsinki and Uusimaa
healthcare district in southern Finland between 2 May and 23 Jun
2007, 2 additional cases caused by this new PCR ribotype were
detected. In this survey, 85 consecutive isolates were further
characterized by the Helsinki University Hospital Laboratory (HUSLAB)
and the National Public Health Institute. These 2 additional strains
had been isolated in May 2007 from 2 elderly patients with severe
underlying conditions who both died from CDAD. All 3 strains were
resistant to moxifloxacin; toxin production and toxinotype were not
investigated. None of the 3 cases of _C. difficile_ PCR ribotype
027-associated disease had connections with foreign countries and no
connections between the cases could be identified. The attending
physicians have been informed and further investigations are ongoing
to identify potential additional cases.

The National Public Health Institute intensifies surveillance and
control of CDAD. A proposal for revising the decree on communicable
diseases is under preparation to include toxin-producing _C.
difficile_ in the National Infectious Disease Register, which is
based on the clinical microbiology laboratory notifications. The
Finnish Hospital Infection Program (SIRO) has prepared a common
protocol for CDAD surveillance in order to detect severe cases and
epidemics caused by _C. difficile_. The SIRO program also provides
training in surveillance methodology and control of CDAD. In
addition, both the HUSLAB and National Public Health Institute are
setting up molecular methods for rapid detection of _C. difficile_
PCR ribotype 027.

[Recent outbreaks of _Clostridium difficile_-associated diarrhea with
increased severity, high relapse rate and significant mortality, have
been related to the emergence of a new, hypervirulent _C. difficile_
strain in North America, Japan, and Europe. The emerging strain,
which hyper-produces toxins A and B, is referred to as North American
pulsed-field type 1 and polymerase chain reaction [PCR] ribotype 027.
These epidemic strains are characteristically resistant to
fluoroquinolones, such as moxifloxacin, which is one risk factor for
disease. - Mod.ML
