Live-animal fairs produced substantial levels of influenza in employees, animals, and their environs, and sequencing indicated transmission involving humans and animals in one case, according to a new study in Clinical Infectious Diseases [see reference below].

Researchers from the CDC and Minnesota obtained samples from 2 markets that were epidemiologically linked to people with infections of variant swine-origin flu. Nasal swabs from 11 of 17 employees (65 percent) tested positive for influenza A, and 7 tested positive multiple times. Also, 11 of 15 workers (73 percent) had baseline hemagglutination-inhibition antibody titers of 40 or higher to swine-origin flu, and 1 had a 4-fold titer increase to both swine-origin and 2009 H1N1 flu.

In addition, influenza A viruses were isolated from 72 of 84 swine (86 percent), from 30 of 45 air samples (67 percent), and from 5 of 21 railings (24 percent). Whole-genome sequencing of viruses isolated from swine and environmental specimens revealed multiple strains and subtype co-detections, with multiple gene segment exchanges.

Finally, genetic sequencing of viruses from a market customer and from swine indicated pig-to-human transmission or vice versa. The authors conclude that live-animal markets may provide conditions for novel flu viruses to emerge.

Clin Infect Dis. 2015. doi: 10.1093/cid/civ618. First published online: 29 Jul 2015; abstract available at http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2015/07/28/cid.civ618.abstract.

Summary: Influenza viruses of swine origin were highly prevalent in live animal markets in Minnesota (USA) and viruses could be isolated from the environment. Multiple IAV [influenza A virus] strains and subtypes were cocirculating, new viral reassortants were identified, and there was evidence of interspecies transmission of IAV from swine to persons.

Background. Live animal markets have been implicated in transmission of influenza A viruses (IAVs) from animals to people. We sought to characterize IAVs at 2 live animal markets in Minnesota to assess potential routes of occupational exposure and risk for interspecies transmission.

Conclusions. At markets where swine and persons are in close contact, swine-origin IAVs are prevalent and potentially provide conditions for novel IAV emergence.

Infection of swine may occur by reverse zoonosis, where humans infect swine, or alternatively, swine may infect humans. In both cases, the pigs are effective mixing vessels for influenza viruses.

These cases are mostly mild, and nearly all associated with exposure to pigs at state and local agricultural fairs. Nonetheless, because of the danger of adaptation to humans, CDC issued guidance: CDC Interim Guidance for Workers who are Employed at Commercial Swine Farms: Preventing the Spread of Influenza A Viruses (http://www.cdc.gov/flu/swineflu/guidance-commercial-pigs.htm) with the goal of preventing the spread of influenza viruses from people to pigs and from pigs to people. - Mod.LK
