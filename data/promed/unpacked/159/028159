BSE, USDA RISK ASSESSMENT - USA

USDA has announced a BSE risk assessment project which is to be conducted by
the Harvard University, Department of Public Health. This initiative is to
be funded by APHIS and to some degree FSIS. Dr. Catherine Woteki (USDA Under
Secretary for Food Safety) is playing a leadership role in the Department.
The announcement covers funding of the 2-year study to conduct a
comprehensive risk assessment of BSE occurring in the USA.
Earlier BSE risk assessments in USA have been conducted by APHIS,
coordinated by CEAH in Ft. Collins. These risk assessments have focused on
sheep scrapie and sheep demographics as measurable risk factors. Conclusions
have been that the risk of BSE occurring in the US due to the theoretical
risk of it occurring due to scrapie is low and getting lower. However, it is
understood that this new independent study will focus on _all_ known BSE
risk factors, assess ways BSE could potentially enter the USA, and identify
prevention strategies and additional measures that could be taken to protect
human and animal health. The USDA Office of Risk Assessment and Benefit/Cost
Analysis will co-ordinate the study as it progresses. USDA will receive
monthly progress reports.

A study of Alzheimer drug effectiveness was once conducted.
I question how non-biologists could possibly get up to speed on the
underlying science of this complex topic in such a short time frame. They
will have to rely on outside advisors -- are they to be a committee of
<> or working research scientists? Is there to be an open
process and opportunities for input and comment? If there are to be
USDA/industry proxies installed as insiders, will there be an equal number
of public interest representatives for balance?
Frankly, can risks be evaluated quantitatively in a meaningful way given the
vast uncertainties surrounding every aspect of transmission, titre, and
incubation time -- I think the answer to this is clearly no. In my opinion,
we could just be looking at a gilded pro forma public relations exercise to
soothe consumer fears. In two years we might hear again from our old friend,
the one in a billion risk, worked backwards to see what the component parts
needed to have been, wrapped in the flag of academic credibility.

[Tom raises some interesting though coloured reservations. In the light of
the current and widely respected and read UK BSE inquiry, more is expected
than in the past. Would someone at Harvard DPH be willing to comment and
indicate how this study will be conducted and by whom? - Mod.MHJ]
