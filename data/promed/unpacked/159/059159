Minister of Agriculture: 2 million doses of FMD vaccine from next week
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Engineer Mohammed Reda Ismail, Minister of Agriculture and Land Reclamation, has said that the processing of more than 2 million doses vaccine against the new FMD virus SAT2 has been completed. The minister pointed out -- in a press statement -- that the Directorate of Veterinary Medicine will start the vaccination operations provided the provinces assure that no vaccinations will be carried out in animals showing disease signs. The mass, general vaccination will start next week, free of charge, in 12 governorates nationwise, particularly the border provinces.

For her part, the Head of the Central Department for Preventive Medicine, Dr. Suhair Abdel Kader, said that that the immunization will coincide with vaccination against Rift Valley fever [RVF] for all livestock namely cattle, buffalo and sheep.

[It will be interesting to note which FMD SAT2 virus strain has been included in the mentioned vaccine and if it is to be applied as a monovalent vaccine or combined with other serotypes known to circulate in Egypt (O, A). It will also be interesting to note if this is a newly-produced vaccine, if it is of local or foreign manufacture, or if it has been formulated from (imported?) frozen antigen.

Combining the FMD vaccination with that of RVF may be based upon practical considerations. According to CFSPH data, Egypt's Veterinary Serum and Vaccine Research Institute (at Abbasiyah) produces only a live attenuated (Smithburn) RVF vaccine, not a killed vaccine; see at http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Vaccines/country_list.php?country=45&lang=en. A live vaccine cannot be mixed with a killed vaccine (such as the FMD vaccine), though they can be applied simultaneously by separate injections.

It will be interesting to note if the Egyptian animal health authorities suspect current circulation of the RVF virus on top of the FMDV SAT2 virus. RVF, a zoonotic disease which causes, in ruminants, abortions and high mortality of young animals, was last reported from animals in Egypt in July 1993. Annual mass vaccinations have been applied there for many years. For 2011, the total RVF vaccination figures were: Bovine 2 910 656 head, Buffaloe 1 878 379, Caprine 689 171, ovine 2 545 078 and camel 269 356. - Mod.AS
