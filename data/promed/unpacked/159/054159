During the first week of May 2002, in the community of Coletas, district of
Sapillica, department of Piura, Peru, 2 deaths occurred, with the following
symptoms: fever, headache, myalgias, jaundice, cyanosis, and seizures. No
hemorrhagic signs were observed.
The National Institute of Health (INS) in Lima, Peru was notified of this
event, evaluating initially 8 samples looking for rickettsiae and
leptospira, obtaining 8 positive for rickettsia by IFA and 1 positive for
Leptospira. Subsequently, a team from INS, together with a local team from
the Health Regional Division of Sullana (DISA) went to the area to
investigate the cases and determine the magnitude of the problem and risk
factors associated with rickettsial and leptospiral transmission.
We obtained second samples from the 8 initially positive cases, and
additionally sampled 141 persons from communities of Coletas, Masias, and
Naranjo, who presented fever, headache, myalgia, malaise, abdominal pain,
nauseas, vomiting, and arthralgia during previous month.
The samples were tested at the INS for leptospirosis by ELISA IgM and
microagglutination (MAT), and for typhus group (TG) and spotted fever group
(SFG) rickettsias by IFA. Out of 141, 25 were positive for leptospira.
Additionally, 14 cases were confirmed as SFG rickettsias.
Here we report the first outbreak of SF rickettsiosis in the north coast of
Peru.

[We'd like to thank Dr. Cespedes of the Peruvian National Institute of
Health for this report of the first occurrence of spotted fever rickettsiae
in northern Peru. ProMED-mail would be grateful to receive further
information on the epidemiologic aspects of this outbreak when available. -

[Information on the clinical illness of the 8 cases subsequently found to
be seropositive for SFG rickettsiae would be appreciated. Further
characterization of the SFG antibody specificity would be helpful in better
defining the species involved. - Mod.LL]
