***********************************
The national health authorities are following the situation very closely and
are considering delivering an international or a selective alert. This could
include a recommendation for tourists comming to Bavaro to use
chemoprophylaxis with chloroquine and other recomendations such as not going
outside the hotel at night and, if necessary, using [mosquito repellents
and other measures.
***********************************
As you probably know, malaria is an endemic disease in the Dominican
Republic.
Every year we have around 1000 cases. The trend has been increasing after
Hurricane Georges hit the country in September 1998. More than 2000 cases
were
registered in 1998 and close to 3500 cases has been detected in 1999 up to
now. All cases in the Dominican Republic are _P. falciparum_. No resistance
to 4
and 8 aminoquinoleines has been detected in surveillance.
In the last 5 years, following prevention and control activities and the
development of a good surveillance system countrywide, there have been two
epidemiological profiles. The first one, [in which about 30 municipalities
and 10% of the national population are involved, is traditional endemic
behavior, with seasonal variation acording to core cycles. About 60 to 70%
of cases come from this area every year. No tourist facilities are located
in these areas.
The other profile is basically outbreaks. About 90% of the population and
more than 120 municipalities are involved. No endemic transmision exists
there, but ocasionally clusters of cases appear, basically related to
migration of persons from endemic areas or related to other outbreaks.
Usually these outbreaks are detected by the surveillance system and easily
controlled in a few weeks.
In the last two years most of the outbreaks have been related to building
new tourist facilities. These new building activities attract hundreds
(sometimes thousands) of migrant workers from other Dominican regions and
from other countries. Most of these new constructions are located in rural
or semirural areas close to beaches in the east of the country.
In week #1 of 1999, an outbreak was detected in the Section of El Salado,
municipality of Higuey, province of La Altagracia. In this Section Bavaro
beach is located. This outbreak was controled in about 8 weeks. More than 90
cases were detected. The epidemiological situation in the province changed
to isolated cases or small clusters in several other municipalities, all of
them related to the initial outbreak. This is considered to be 'normal'
epidemiological behavior in these circumstances and places. All these
clusters or isolated cases were controlled in few weeks in any case.
In week #32 a new outbreak was detected in the same Section. Despite
anti-epidemic activities, high incidence has not been controlled for periods
of more than one week. From week #32 until #49, more than 200 new cases have
been detected. This is a small area around 15 square km. and the outbreak
has been peaking alternately in several concentrations of workers.
A recent reevaluation of the situation concluded on 14 Dec 1999. No
evidence of resistence in the plamodium or the vector has been detected. No
lack of basic resources seem to be relevant (after Hurricane Georges, in
September 1998, the national program was reinforced with more supplies,
vehicles, etc. because big outbreaks were expected, according to previous
experience with Hurricane David 20 years ago).
The explanation of this lack of success is absolutely social -- the
magnitude of the new constructions and the extraordinary number of workers
involved. Because of the organization of the companies, on the base of
subcontractors, there is no available central register or control of
workers. Close to 50% of them are foreigners, most of them in an irregular
condition. So, many of them avoid contacts with authorities and try to hide
themselves. There also is a high rotation of workers, basically by periods
of weeks.
Actually, tourists are not at high risk, about 1 million have been lodged in
several tourist complexes in La Altagracia province this year and according
to available information, no more than 20 seem to have been infected.
Nevertheless one million more are supposed to come to this area in the next
weeks and months (high season), and people coming from non-endemic areas
could be more susceptible. Recommendations could also emphasize seeking
medical attention if they get fever in a period of two weeks after leaving
the country.
Other recommended measures are to reinforce the number of health workers in
the area in the next weeks, and developing a special organization of workers
and contractors, in order to reinforce surveillance and anti-epidemic
measures. Technical goals are to assure that 100% of new workers receive
treatment, 100% of suspicious cases (fever) are detected in a few hours and
treated with a radical scheme, maintain antivectorial measures for several
weeks (biolarvicides in wild breeding places, thermal smog in open areas of
building activities and residual insecticides in bed "rooms" and "houses"
of workers). It is assumed that these measures could be enough to control
this outbreak in several weeks. We are assuming that a critical point is
the organization inside the construction [areas.
