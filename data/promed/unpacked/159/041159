The pathology described sounds remarkably similar to acute bracken
poisoning. Though how this relates to this syndrome in Germany is
hard to see. The toxin in bracken acts significantly against bone
marrow. The complete absence of neutrophils is pathognomonic and was
seen in the one major outbreak I have seen in adult bovines (Belize
1980s ). This outbreak also demonstrated dramatic haemorrhages and
death not unlike anthrax. (All cases we attended were checked out for
anthrax with negative results.) Secondary infections were also likely
in the cases we saw. The mortality in the severely affected was
practically 100 percent. Bracken was present and little other forage
available to eat. It is hard to see how calves so young could have
been exposed to such a toxin or similar so soon after birth unless
some bizarre from of forage management is being practiced. All the
same I would still check out the forage management.

The listing on the so-called "blood sweating" syndrome in calves in
Germany was read with interest. Veterinary pathologists at the
Queensland Department of Primary Industries and Fisheries' Animal
Disease Surveillance Laboratory at Toowoomba have seen this type of
syndrome in weaner cattle [calves weaned during the current year.
-Mod.AS] with ptaquiloside poisoning (rock/mulga fern). Fever is due
to secondary bacteraemias associated with severe pancytopaenia. It
was also noted that a similar syndrome was seen years ago with calves
[which] were given unprescribed furazolidone. I understand as with
other countries, the EU banned nitrofurans in the mid 1990's. These
cases were seen in the late 1980's in Queensland and were documented
in the Australian Veterinary Journal, vol 68, 1991, pages 182-3.

[Both responders, who are kindly acknowledged, indicate fern
poisoning as the possible cause for the clinical and pathological
changes described from Germany.

For a review addressing the etiology, clinical findings, diagnosis,
treatment, and prevention of bracken fern poisoning, see Merck
Veterinary Manual at
<http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/210400.htm&word=fern%2cpoisoning>.

The Australian commentary mentions also furazolidone as a possible
causative factor. - Mod.AS]

[Bracken (_Pteridium_ spp.) fern does contain ptaquiloside, which
produces a radiomimetic effect on the animals, and thus they would be
more susceptible to bacterial infections. Both contributors are
correct. - Mod.TG]
