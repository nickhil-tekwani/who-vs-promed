Whooping cough is now an epidemic in California, and is on pace to
break a 50-year record for infections for the year. As of 15 Jun
2010, California had 910 recorded cases of the highly contagious
disease, and 5 babies -- all under 3 months of age -- have died from
the disease this year.

"Children should be vaccinated against the disease and parents,
family members and caregivers of infants need a booster shot,"
California Department of Public Health director Dr. Mark Horton said
Wednesday [23 Jun 2010].

This year's surge in cases of whooping cough, also known as
pertussis, is a 4-fold increase from the same period last year, when
219 cases were recorded. At least 600 additional cases are under
investigation by local health departments. Officials fear that with
the number of known and suspected cases at 1510, the state is on
track to beat 1958's record 3847 cases; midway through that year,
1200 cases had been reported.

Nationally, 23 weeks into 2010, there were 4656 cases of whooping
cough, compared with 6017 cases in the same period in 2009, according
to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The declaration of epidemic is made after a significant increase in
the number of illnesses to a broad swath of the state's population,
said state health department spokesman Ken August.

Health officials say whooping cough is cyclical and tends to peak
every 2 to 5 years. A typical case starts with a cough and runny nose
for one to 2 weeks, followed by weeks or months of rapid coughing
fits that sometimes end with a whooping sound. Fever is rare.

Unimmunized or incompletely immunized babies are particularly
vulnerable. A total of 3 vaccines are administered for whooping
cough, from 2 to 6 months of age. Neither vaccine nor surviving the
illness provides lifetime immunity.

[An older vaccine called DTP (an acronym for a triple vaccine used to
immunize against diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis) has been
replaced by DTaP, a safer version in which the pertussis component is acellular
(<http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/vis/downloads/vis-dtap.pdf>). DTP
is no longer used in the United States. Children should get 5 doses
of DTaP vaccine, one dose at each of the following ages: 2, 4, 6, and
15-18 months, and 4-6 years of age. DTaP is not licensed for
adolescents, adults, or children 7 years of age and older. A single
dose of another vaccine called Tdap, which is similar to DTaP, is
recommended for people 11 through 64 years of age in place of their
next Td booster (recommended to be given every 10 years). Td,
protects against tetanus and diphtheria, but not pertussis.

From the moderator LL's comments in a prior ProMED post Pertussis -
USA: (MN) 20100514.1573:

"Cases of pertussis in previously vaccinated older children and
adults are generally attributed to waning immunity without
considering potential differences in _Bordetella pertussis_ strains.
As pointed out in 2009 by Dr Frits Mooi (ProMED-mail Pertussis -
Australia (02): (SA) 20091108.3876): There are now many studies which
show that outbreaks of pertussis are often associated with changes in
the _B. pertussis_ population. Most recently, we have shown that more
virulent (P3) strains have appeared which we believe to be (partly)
responsible for the outbreak in the Netherlands. The P3 strains have
emerged worldwide. Any discussion on the causes of sudden upsurges in
infectious diseases should include changes in the pathogen
population. This is even true for pertussis.
