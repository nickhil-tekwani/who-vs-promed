[1] Cholera - Angola

Angola is suffering its worst outbreak of cholera in more than a
decade, recording 554 deaths and 12 052 cases in just over 2 months,
according to Doctors Without Borders.
The disease has spread unusually fast, even for Africa, where cholera
epidemics are common and often hard to control, said Stephan
Goetghebuer, an operational coordinator for the organization. It has
set up 8 clinics in Angola to treat the sick and plans to open more.
"The severity of this outbreak is something remarkable, really rare,"
Mr. Goetghebuer said in a phone interview from Brussels. Initially
concentrated in the capital, Luanda, the disease has spread to 3
other cities within a radius of about 250 miles.
In 2005, cholera swept through West Africa, striking 20 000 people in
Guinea Bissau alone, Mr. Goetghebuer said. [So far in 2006], aid
workers have fought outbreaks in Zambia, Zimbabwe, Malawi and
southern Sudan. But Angola has largely been spared cholera outbreaks
since 1995. That may have lessened the population's immunity and
helps explain the rapid spread of the disease since the first case
was reported on 13 Feb 2006, Mr. Goetghebuer said.
Luanda's slums are a perfect breeding ground for cholera, which is
typically transmitted through contaminated food or water. In the
poorest sections, latrines are rare and children play in open
trenches that carry waste, said Richard Veerman, who is organizing
the response by Doctors Without Borders.
Mr. Goetghebuer said, "The hygiene is terrible -- terrible, even
compared to other places in Africa."

symptoms in the Chongoroi Municipal Hospital, south Benguela

A month-long outbreak of cholera has killed 21 people and stricken
253 in mainland Tanzania and the semiautonomous Zanzibar archipelago,
the country's health officials said on Wednesday.
A spokesperson for the Dar es Salaam city council, Gaston Makwembe,
said 12 people have died in the past 4 days, and 115 were taken to
hospitals in Tanzania's commercial capital.
He said 9 people have died of the disease in Zanzibar in the past
month, and 137 cases have been reported. Zanzibar's health minister
Sultan Mugheiry said those infected were [placed] in special
government camps in an attempt to curb the disease.
[During March 2006], Zanzibar banned the sale of food and juice on
the street, and closed some local restaurants in attempts to stop the
disease from spreading.
Mugheiry said: "We are confident that the situation is under control."
Cholera has erupted across East Africa, after heavy rains in the region.

At least 9 people have died of cholera in the past month on
Tanzania's Zanzibar archipelago, officials said, appealing for
improved sanitation to help fight the outbreak. At least 5
additional fatalities have been reported since authorities in late
Mar 2006 gave a death toll of 4 and more than 137 people have been
taken ill by the waterborne disease, health minister Sultan Mohamed
Mugheiry said Tue, 18 Apr 2006.
"We still have the cholera problem in both Unguja and Pemba islands
and I appeal to the public to use boiled water and keep their
environment clean," he said, adding that a ban on street sales of
sugar cane juice remains in effect. Despite the additional deaths,
Mugheiry said the health situation "seems to be stable" on Zanzibar,
which is home to about a million people.

Cholera has repeatedly hit Zanzibar in recent years, with the last
severe outbreak recorded in 1997, when more than 1100 people were
taken ill by the disease and at least 124 died.

[Text of report entitled "GHS worried over 93 cholera cases recorded
in Accra" published by Ghanaian independent Joy FM radio on 16 Apr 2006]
The Ghana Health Service says the rising number of cholera cases in
parts of the Greater Accra region gives cause for concern. The
Service has recorded 93 cases alone in April 2006, compared to none
in 2005 over the same period.
The Greater Accra regional director of the GHS, Dr Edward Antwi told
JOYNEWS that the current prevalence of the disease can be traced to
the last outbreak from Sep through Dec 2005. He said although no
deaths have been recorded yet, the situation remains alarming. He
said, "with cholera, even one case is alarming. I mean cholera is one
of the notifiable diseases. When we say notifiable, it means that one
case is too many."

The cholera outbreak in 2005/06 has been the worst since 2001/02 with
4394 cases and 53 deaths reported.
Since the first outbreaks of cholera were reported on 17 Oct 2005,
the Epidemiological Unit under the Ministry of Health has recorded a
total of 4359 cases of cholera outbreaks and 53 deaths in 19
districts. The outbreaks were triggered by persistent poor conditions
of hygiene and limited access to safe water and sanitation
facilities, but were exacerbated by the food crisis and the onset of
the rainy season. Food shortages and malnutrition have a direct
effect on individual susceptibility to diseases and thus the level of
outbreaks has been directly related to people's access to food and
safe water in the affected districts.
In comparison, a total of 1017 and 784 cholera cases were reported at
the same time in 2004/05 and 2003/04, respectively. The case fatality
rate has been decreasing since 2001/02 from 3.3 to 1.2 percent for
2005/06, but is still higher than the recommended fatality rate of
less than 1 percent (WHO). The number of reported cases per week has
now been decreasing since the 3rd week of Feb 2006 and is expected to
decrease further as Malawi is nearing the end of the rainy season,
although sporadic outbreaks during the dry season may occur.

A cholera outbreak has killed over 340 people in southern Sudan
bordering Uganda, causing fears that the disease will spread into
Uganda, especially Gulu and Kitgum districts.
"The situation is bad and we fear it might spread to the northern
districts of Gulu and Kitgum," the Rev. Tobiolo Alberio of African
Inland Church (AIC) said on Fri, 14 Apr 2006. He said the outbreak
began in Juba and Yei and it spread to Eastern Equatoria in Torit,
Ikotos and Lopit.
Alberio disclosed that over 90 people had died in Juba, 100 in Torit,
80 in Lotip and at least 70 in Eastern Equatoria. He urged people to
observe proper hygiene to prevent further spread of the disease.

Some young children have died from cholera in central Burma's
Mandalay, where the deadly avian flu H5N1 occurred recently. Local
residents told DVB that they are very concerned. Health staff also
told DVB that there has been an increase in the [numbers of] cases of
cholera in recent days.
As the cholera outbreak is occurring out of season, staff from
divisional health department have been carrying out field work and
tests and telling people to spray disinfectants around the areas affected.
A nurse who doesn't want to be identified said that most patients are
young children with severe diarrhea from poor wards in Kanthaya or
Pyigyitagun, where the hygiene is particularly poor due to acute
poverty. But another nurse from Mandalay general hospital said that
although she heard the reports, no patients have turned up at the hospital.
