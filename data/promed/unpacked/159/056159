Please kindly note that the below featured item [Archive 20060316.0822
-Mod.DK] on polio eradication has a number of factual errors in it. Since
1 Jan 2006, there have been 12 cases of polio in India. The 58 cases
stated in the item below is in actuality for the rolling 12-month period of
March 2005 to March 2006. Additionally, I believe the 1995 reference is a
typo, and should read 2005. In the 2005 calendar year, there were in fact
66 cases of polio in India, of which 4 were due to type 3 polio, and 62
were due to type 1 polio. In total, of the 66 cases in India in 2005
calendar year, 29 were from Uttar Pradesh (not 25).

[ProMED-mail would like to thank Oliver Rosenbauer for pointing out the
errors in the moderator's comment accompanying Poliomyelitis - Worldwide
(04): Bangladesh 20060316.0822. Some of the information was obtained from
a document on the India Expert Advisory Group for Poliomyelitis Eradication
held on 5-6 Dec 2005 and apparently did not have complete information on
the end-of-year status of polio activity in India. As for the other
errors, this moderator can only claim a senior moment or two that led to a
misreading of the information on the polio eradication website combined
with a typographical error. Again, many thanks to Oliver Rosenbauer for
correcting this. - Mod.MPP]
