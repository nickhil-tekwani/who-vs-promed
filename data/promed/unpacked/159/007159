New hosts of Turnip mosaic virus in Zimbabwe
---------------------------
S Chivasa <stephen.chivasa@durham.ac.uk>, Department of Crop Science,
University of Zimbabwe, Harare [now at University of Durham, Biological
Sciences Dept., Durham, DH1 3LE, UK], E J A Ekpo, Department of Crop
Protection and Environmental Management, University of Ibadan, Nigeria, R
G T Hicks, Department of Biology and Biochemistry, University of Bath,
Bath, BA2 7AY, UK. Accepted for publication 10/08/01
Necrotic rings, lines and spots were observed on approximately 90% of
cabbage (_Brassica oleracea_ var. capitata_) ... growing in a field in
Harare [and on] ... cabbages in nearby fields and in retail outlets. A
virus isolated from an affected plant and established as a single lesion
culture, by serial passage in _Chenopodium quinoa_ (chlorotic/necrotic
local lesions, no systemic infection), produced symptoms typical of
Turnip mosaic virus (TuMV) in a range of indicator plants.
TuMV was confirmed in cabbage and _C. quinoa_ sap by PAS-ELISA,
using antiserum to a UK isolate of the virus. All PAS-ELISAs included
positive and negative (healthy) controls and test samples were
considered positive if their means (A405) exceeded negative controls
by more than 3 SD and were significantly different (P<0.05).
Rothwell (1983) lists _Brassica oleracea_ as the only previously-known
host for TuMV in Zimbabwe. ... Sap samples from crop and wild hosts
in Harare region within 1-2 km of the outbreak tested positive in PAS-
ELISA and induced diagnostic symptoms in _C. quiona_: the
dicotyledons _Amaranthus hybridus_, _Brassica juncea_, _Conyza
sumatrensis_, _Galinsoga parviflora_, _Portulaca oleracea_, _Sida
alba_, _Sonchus oleraceus_ and _Hibiscus esculentus_; the
monocotyledons _Commelina bengalensis_ and _Musa sapientum
L._ (banana). _Bidens pilosa_ and Cyperus esculentus_
(monocotyledons) also tested positive for TuMV in PAS-ELISA,
although sap was not infectious.
With the exception of _B. juncea_, and _H. esculentus_, the above
species are apparently new hosts of TuMV (Broadbent, 1957; Stobbs &
Stirling, 1990). Calanthe sp. (Orchidaceae) is the only other
monocotyledonous host reported for TuMV (Brunt et al., 1990).
In tests, the aphids _Myzus persicae_, _Brevicoryne brassicae_ and
_Aphis fabae_, transmitted the virus non-persistently, between infected
and healthy cabbage plants in Zimbabwe, and may have been
responsible for local spread of the virus. Further work is needed to
establish whether infection of _Musa_ [banana] and other apparently
new hosts, is associated with disease.

[TuMV is a species of the genus Potyvirus. It was first reported in
_Brassica campestris_ ssp. _chinensis_, _B. japonica_, and _B.
campestris_ ssp. _rapa_ in 1921 in the United States. If it is widely
spread in Zimbabwe (which is not yet known), the virus may pose
problems for banana growers. From the text of the paper, I cannot
determine if infected _Musa_ expressed symptoms. If it is symptom-
less, and considering the likelihood of co-infection with other viruses,
synergistic symptoms might be expected.
The additional monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous hosts are also of
interest to virologists. It would be interesting to determine if the
Zimbabwean isolate of TuMV is adapted to conditions in Africa but not
able to infect the same hosts in more northern climes. The virus is
probably distributed worldwide and has been reported to be spreading
in Australia, China, and the UK.
