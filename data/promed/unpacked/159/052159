Imported Rabies Cases - Comment
The last reported human rabies case in the US from Nepal should draw
attention to the rising number of imported rabies cases. In France, a
female patient died from rabies on 11th of February 1997 after a dog bite
in India (Goa). Five other cases were reported in Europe during 1996; one
in Germany (contamination in Sri Lanka); one in England (contamination in
Nigeria); 3 in France (one contamination in Madagascar; two in Algeria).
There is no doubt that increase in international transport and tourism is
modifying the risk of rabies. There is a necessity to re-evaluate the
pre-exposure immunization against rabies for travellers in highly endemic
countries. The pre-exposure vacccination should be highly recommended for
travellers in remote areas where the risk of rabies is enhanced by
difficulties in availability of potent tissue culture rabies vaccines.
