According to the website of the Ministry of Agriculture, as of 26 Apr 2013 a total of 46 samples have been found positive for avian influenza virus H7N9 by the provincial labs and the National Avian Influenza Reference Laboratory. There is no isolate of the virus from any poultry farm around the country [but see "pigeon farm in Nantong City, Jiangsu province" in the next paragraph but one, and the OIE Follow-up report no. 4, 22 Apr 2013 (one outbreak): one [chicken] farm in Jiangsu -- in the Comment at the end, below.- Mod.JW].

The Ministry of Agriculture said that as of 26 Apr 2013, the provincial labs and the National Avian Influenza Reference Laboratory have received a total of 390 628 samples collected in 13 014 monitoring sampling points in the field, of which there are 2587 live poultry markets, 337 poultry slaughterhouses, 8808 poultry farms (village), 341 wild bird habitats, 277 pig slaughterhouses, 31 pig farms, and 633 environmental sampling points.

At present, 218 897 tests have been accomplished, of which there were 150 837 serological tests and 68 060 for antigen detection. It has been found that 46 samples were positive for avian influenza virus H7N9, which means a positive rate of 0.07 percent [out of 68 060]. 44 of the samples, from 14 locations, were from birds and the environments in commercial live poultry markets in Shanghai, Anhui, Zhejiang, Jiangsu and Henan provinces (municipalities). 2 positive samples were derived outside the live markets, in pigeons: a wild pigeon in Nanjing, Jiangsu province, and a pigeon on a pigeon farm in Nantong City, Jiangsu province. The remaining samples were negative.

Next, the Ministry of Agriculture will continue to strengthen the poultry sector and its collaboration. At the same time, monitoring will be enhanced and efforts to study the virus intensified. Control measures are to be fortified in line with continued risk assessments.

According to a news release on the website of the Ministry of Agriculture on 26 Apr 2013, the animal disease prevention and control center of Zhejiang province detected 6 chickens suspected to be infected by the H7N9 virus. Of the 6 samples, 3 have been confirmed as H7N9-infected by the National Avian Influenza Reference Laboratory [Harbin]. The samples are from a commercial live market [this has to be verified] in Lin'an, Hangzhou, Zhejiang province. The virus identified is highly homologous to the strain isolated from a pigeon on 4 Apr 2013.

The Ministry of Agriculture has asked the Zhejiang province authorities to intensify monitoring activities and implementation of prevention and control measures.

Up to now, the National Avian Influenza Reference Laboratory has reported a total of 46 H7N9 confirmed samples.

Malaysia has temporarily frozen imports of chicken products from China as a precaution against H7N9 avian influenza, officials said Friday [26 Apr 2013].

Department of Veterinary Services director-general Abd Aziz Jamaluddin of the Agricultural Ministry said his department has issued an order to detain all containers of chicken products imported from China for tests, following the 1st H7N9 case reported in China's Shandong province on 22 Apr 2013.

Malaysia currently imports around 20 000 to 22 000 metric tonnes of frozen deboned chicken meat annually from 2 large plants based in Shandong, and 4800 metric tonnes of such chicken products were imported in the 1st 3 months this year [2013], according to an official statement.

Meanwhile, all applications to import chicken products from China are temporarily frozen, Abd Aziz said.

Malaysia has an effective mechanism of cooperation with China, neighbouring countries, the World Health Organization, and research institutes worldwide to prevent H7N9 from hitting Malaysia, he added.

He stressed that all the measures taken are for precaution purposes. "We cannot take a chance ... but we don't want to be seen as sending alarms to the public," he said. No H7N9 cases have been reported in Malaysia so far.

23 have died, and a total of 108 H7N9 cases have been reported since the outbreak of the new subtype of avian flu, according to the Wednesday [24 Apr 2013] update of China's National Health and Family Planning Commission [as of 26 Apr 2013, the official number of confirmed H7N9 cases on mainland China is 112, of which there have been 23 deaths. The 1st human case in the province of Fujian, now added to the list, has been published on 26 Apr 2013; the 65-year-old male patient showed initial symptoms on 18 Apr 2013. - Mod.AS].

[The 3 new positive samples from Lin'an, Hangzhou, Zhejiang province mentioned in item 2 above were reported by China's veterinary services to the OIE on 26 Apr 2013 and were briefly described in follow-up report No. 6. The report is available with an interactive map at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?reportid=13314.

Here is the time-lined, updated list of OIE's (modified) reports since 4 Apr 2013:

1. Immediate notification, 4 Apr 2013 (one outbreak): one wholesale market, Shanghai, in which there were one infected pigeon for consumption, 7 samples from chickens, and one sample from the environment; a total of 9 samples.

2. Follow-up report no. 1, 5 Apr 2013 (2 outbreaks): 2 live markets, Shanghai; 3 samples from chickens, 2 samples from pigeons, and 5 samples from the environment; total 10 samples.

3. Follow-up report no. 2, 10 Apr 2013 (5 outbreaks): 5 live markets (3 in Jiangsu, 1 Anhui, 1 Zhejiang); 11 samples from chickens, 3 samples from ducks; total 14 samples.

4. Follow-up report no. 3, 16 Apr 2013 (3 outbreaks): 2 live markets in Zhejiang (4 chickens), one location in Jiangsu (1 wild pigeon); total 5 samples.

5. Follow-up report no. 4, 22 Apr 2013 (one outbreak): one farm in Jiangsu, one sample from a pigeon (340 "birds" destroyed).

6. Follow-up report no. 5, 24 Apr 2013 (3 outbreaks): 2 live markets in Henan ("environmental samples"), one unspecified, named location in Zhejiang (one case in a "bird").

7. Follow-up report no. 6, 26 Apr 2013 (one outbreak): one live market(?) in Zhejiang (3 samples from "birds;" according to MOA, these were chickens).

In view of today's (26 Apr 2013) addition of Fujian to the list of infected provinces, it will be interesting to obtain information on the possible exposure of the patient to animals/products and on the veterinary surveillance activities there. - Mod.AS
