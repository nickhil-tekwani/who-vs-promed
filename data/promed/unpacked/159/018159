FBI investigators believe photocopy machines helped spread anthrax
throughout the American Media Inc. headquarters last year [2001]
before the building was quarantined. While testing the 3-story
building for anthrax spores, investigators found that every copy
machine in the building (more than 24 in all) tested positive for
anthrax, according to a source familiar with the investigation. The
anthrax is believed to have gotten into the copiers from reams of
copy paper that had trapped airborne spores in the company's mail
room, where the paper was stored. The FBI's theory helps explain for
the first time the presence of anthrax throughout the 68
000-square-foot building.
Since an AMI photo editor died in October 2001 and a AMI mail room
employee was hospitalized, officials surmised the anthrax might have
been spread by a rolling mail cart used to deliver the letters to AMI
departments.
More important, the FBI's discoveries will lay the foundation for an
emerging branch of science that studies anthrax dispersal in public
buildings. Anthrax previously had been studied as a livestock disease
or in the context of biochemical warfare on the battlefield. "No
doubt, whatever they discover will be significant, because it will be
a one-time opportunity to see what happened," said Dr. Keith Ward,
program manager in the Biomolecular and Biosystems Group at the
federal Office of Naval Research in Virginia. "The problem is we
don't have a lot of experience with this sort of thing."
The FBI search operation, which began 27 Aug 2002 and ended Sun 8 Sep
2002, was the first comprehensive search of the supermarket tabloid's
publishing office, the FBI said.
The Environmental Protection Agency in 2001 had detected trace
residues of anthrax in 84 spots in the building in a partial search.
One of the FBI's objectives this time was to map the entire AMI
building for anthrax distribution. The agency said it would use newly
developed forensic techniques to determine how the anthrax spread
through the building once it was brought in. Officials surmised last
year that anthrax entered the building in at least 2 letters, because
of anthrax contamination at 2 different post offices that served the
building.
Once investigators realized the copy machines were contaminated, they
traced the anthrax back to its point of origin: an open storage area
in AMI's first-floor mail room. Apparently, someone in the mail room
opened a letter containing anthrax, which dispersed the microscopic
particles. The spores settled on the company's supply of copy paper.
Anthrax spores tend to stick to surfaces upon settling, said Palm
Beach County Health Department spokesman Tim O'Connor. The spores can
detach from surfaces, but loosening the particles requires sufficient
force. This adhesive quality was described to local health officials
by anthrax experts from the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) during last year's anthrax crisis in Palm Beach
County.
"Once it falls, it stays," O'Connor said. "It was stuck to the
keyboard in Stevens' office. It stuck in the machinery that sorts the
mail in post offices." According to the FBI's reconstruction of
events, AMI employees unwittingly distributed the clinging spores
throughout the building when taking reams of copy paper to every
department in the building, including AMI's library, executive
offices and such publications as The National Enquirer, Weekly World
News and National Examiner, which were published in the building.
When the copy paper was inserted into the machines and used to make
copies, investigators believe, the spores dislodged and were
"aerosolized" into the atmosphere by the whirring fans and other
moving parts of the high-speed copiers.
FBI investigators, working with scientists from the Agency for Toxic
Substances and Disease Registry, removed nearly 5000 pieces of
evidence during their search of the building. The property seizures
included more than 800 letters tainted with anthrax as well as
shelves and folders from AMI's mail room. However, no copy machines
were removed from the building, according to a 34-page inventory the
FBI filed Thursday in U.S. District Court in Washington.
It's not clear whether the FBI took any items from the photocopying
areas. The FBI's court filing lists 2 vacuum samples and 6 carpet
samples, but it doesn't disclose where they came from. The court
papers also list several broom heads and mop heads.

[First, institutional memories are short, barely 20 years. When I
first started my biometeorological studies 35+ years ago it was very
clear that air-flow studies in buildings, with or without pathogens,
were alive, well, and thriving in the 1950s and 1960s. Unfortunately
every young scientist has to rediscover Amerika, to quote the Russian
saying. Secondly, copy paper comes in reams wrapped in heavy paper.
Therefore any surface contamination in the basement mail room would
be on the top surface of a pile of wrapped paper and on the front
face of a stack ditto. Obviously any spores on the wrapping may be
dislodged at the time it is ripped off. How many spores then make
their way into a copier is another question. If chance contamination
of the 17 sq. inches of the end face of a wrapped ream of copy paper
is sufficient to contaminate a copier, the contents of the letter or
letters that were opened in the mail room would have had to be of a
quality and quantity of dry anthrax spores similar to that seen in
New York and Washington DC. All this indicates that there were a
number of very lucky people in that building. - Mod.MHJ]
