[This message does not provide information about additional cases of SLE
but is posted because it contains some details not available previously. -
Mod.CHC
Total number of cases in Louisiana is 8, with 7 in Jefferson Parish
(Metairie/Kenner). One case involves a 46 year-old Metairie woman.
Louisiana state epidemiologist Louise McFarland was quoted as saying "I
don't think we have an epidemic, but we do have an outbreak."
The newspaper reported that chickens used to monitor outbreaks in Kenner
have tested positive. The 8th Jefferson Parish case has been confirmed.
There are also apparently 2 cases in Lafayette, Louisiana. Lafayette is
over 100 miles from the Kenner/Metairie outbreak area.
Jefferson Parish is now switching to Anvil and Biomist to combat the
mosquitoes. These chemicals are said to reduce the mosquito kill time from
six hours to 15 minutes. These chemicals are also said by a Mosquito
Control Inc. representative, to be less toxic than aspirin and slightly
more toxic than sea water. (Feedback on this would be appreciated - MJR)

[Interesting that as of 31 August sentinel chickens had not provided
evidence for the presence of SLE virus but at least one human case had
onset in mid-August. Not very efficient to have a sentinel human system to
determine chicken infections. Could be the mosquitoes feeding on humans
are not the ones feeding on the chickens, in which event the system breaks
down. If anyone is doing mosquito testing in Louisiana please let us know
from which mosquitoes (_Culex pipiens-quinquefasciantus_ ?) SLE virus is
being isolated there. - Mod.CHC
