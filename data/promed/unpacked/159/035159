During January [2008], 221 dengue cases have been registered [in
Margarita Island] in the state of Nueva Esparta, according to Jorge
Alchaer, director of the state health system, with the majority of
cases in the Gomez, Diaz, and Marcano municipalities, where there is
water storage due to deficiencies in the [availability] of a potable
water system, as well as problems with urban trash collection.

Due to the increasing trend in the number of cases, this Wednesday [6
Feb 2008] there was agreement to create an emergency commission to
try to reduce cases of the disease in a short time [period].

Alchaer explained that trash and mosquito breeding site problems
cannot be taken on completely by the Ministry of Health, urging the
communities to identify possible mosquito breeding sites in their
areas, "and then we can provide larvicides and insecticides to attack
the problem," he noted.

In addition, Falcon state registered its 1st fatal case of the
disease so far this year [2008].

Within the country, an increase in the numbers of dengue cases has
been observed in regional health directorates. The Loreto Regional
Health Directorate (DIRESA) has continued to be in an epidemic
situation during the 1st 3 weeks of the year [2008], with 91 percent
of the cases from the Iquitos, San Juan Bautista, and Punchana districts.

The Jaen and Madre de Dios DIRESAs, after registering outbreaks
during the 1st week [of 2008], have shown a decrease in the number of cases.

Through the 3rd epidemiological week (EW), 49 districts (16 more
districts than the previous EW) have reported dengue cases. The
districts of Iquitos, San Juan Bautista, and Punchana of the Loreto
DIRESA reported 91 percent of the regional cases.

The Ucayali DIRESA has reported a total of 100 cases and currently
continues to report cases. [Of these] 97 percent of the cases are
from the districts of Calleria (36 cases), Irazola (39 cases),
Yarinacocha (10 cases), and Manantay (12 cases).

The Jaen DIRESA has reported dengue cases, with the districts of San
Jose del Alto reporting 79 percent of the cases in this health
region. Through the 3rd EW, 14 classical dengue cases have been reported.

The Madre de Dios DIRESA through EW 03 has reported only 8 cases of
classical dengue, all from the Tambopata district.

The San Martin DIRESA has had 54 cases of classical dengue, 70
percent from the districts of Banda de Shilcayo, Tarapoto, and
Caspisapa. This latter district belongs to the Picota Province.

A present, the Health Directorate (DISA) of Lima city has reported 3
probable classical dengue cases from the districts of Comas (1
[case]), Independencia (1), and San Martin (1). Epidemiological
investigations are underway and laboratory results [for the suspected
cases] are awaited. DISA has reported the presence of _Aedes aegypti_
[in various areas of the city. For details see the original report. -

There were 158 deaths in the country, exceeding those of 2002. In
January [2008], the [number] of cases declined.

The cases of DHF [dengue hemorrhagic fever] were never more lethal as
in the past year [2007]. In 2007, 158 deaths were recorded in the
country. This [number] is more than double that of 2006, a year in
which 76 [DHF] deaths were confirmed. This [2007] number was also
greater than the previous yearly record in 2002, when 150 people died
as a result of this disease.

According to a Ministry of Health (MOH) bulletin released yesterday
[4 Feb 2008] there were 559 954 dengue cases registered in the
country in 2007, 1541 of which were DHF.

In 2007, 86 percent of the DHF cases were concentrated in he states
of Ceara, Rio, Maranhao, Pernambuco, Amazonas, Mato Grosso do Sul,
Piaui, Goias, Alagoas, Paraiba, and Rio Grande do Norte. Concerning
deaths, 64 percent occurred in these same states.

Sao Paulo [state] registered the greatest number of cases (82 912)
and Rio led with the most deaths (29). The central-eastern region had
the highest dengue incidence rate (827 cases per 100 000
inhabitants). This region registered 111 757 dengue cases with 192
registered DHF cases and 35 deaths.

In the central-eastern region, unlike the rest of the country,
[dengue virus] transmission was most frequent in municipalities with
more than 500 000 inhabitants. The capital of Mato Grosso do Sul
[state], Campo Grande, was the Brazilian city with the greatest
number of registered dengue cases in 2007, [with] 45 515.

According to the Director of Health Surveillance, Eugenio Barros, the
high DHF mortality rate was due to circulation of dengue virus type
3. [There are apparent differences in pathogenicity between various
dengue type 3 isolates. Unfortunately, there is no satisfactory
laboratory animal model to test for pathogenicity of various dengue
virus isolates, so one is left with associating clinical observations
with the particular dengue virus serotype in circulation at the time. - Mod.TY]

The prospects for 2008, however, are better [than 2007]. During the
1st month of the past year [January 2007] there were 19 731 people
infected with dengue. In January of this year [2008], only 30.

Health authorities' attention was called to another state, Parana. In
December [2007] the [number] of [dengue] cases in the state increased
827 percent (with 8356 notified dengue cases) in the southern region
compared to the same period in 2006. The cities most affected were
Foz do Iguacu, with 4630 cases, and Londrina, with 3777.

Santa Catarina continues to be the only Brazilian state without
autochthonous dengue [virus] transmission. Of the 678 registered
cases, all were contracted in other states.

Although the epidemiological bulletin released yesterday [4 Feb 2008]
by the MOH provided good news, it was incomplete. There is a clear
trend in [numbers of] dengue cases in the country between January of
this year [2008] and last year [2007], but the MOH still has not
received complete data from the states. Up to the present, 7520
[dengue] cases were confirmed in January versus 53 224 during the
same period last year [2007].

According to the Sao Paulo State Surveillance Center, as of Friday [1
Feb 2008] there were 170 confirmed [dengue] cases in the state. This
is an improvement in relation to January 2007, when 4694 people were infected.

[There is a tendency, going forward, to term cases as more serious.
What is worrisome is that the [case] fatality rate, which was 10
percent, was often 1 or 2 percent above this accepted [figure].
Looking at notifications, just those serious cases are notified as
such, and the others go unrecognized [and hence unreported. -

Dengue caused 3 deaths in the city of Rio de Janeiro this year
[2008]; one adult and 2 children. The Municipal Secretary of Health
noted that for each 10 persons infected with dengue [virus] in the
1st 15 days of the year [1-15 Jan 2008], 4 were children.

According to the Municipal superintendent of Health Surveillance,
Meri Baran, this picture is due to the occurrence of [dengue] virus
type 2, which has not been present for a long time, with dengue
[virus] type 3 occupying the [epidemiological] space in the most
recent years. In this way people previously infected with a
[particular dengue virus] serotype can be infected again but with
another serotype [of the virus].

In January [2008] the Secretariat [of Health] noted that 2150 dengue
cases were registered in the capital [of Rio de Janeiro state] -- in
the same period last year [2007] there were 981 cases. The prefecture
could not provide information about the numbers of children involved,
as the study of pediatric dengue was just done between 1-15 January [2008].

Queensland Health has confirmed 2 people at Mossman, near Port
Douglas, have acquired the disease.

The most recent outbreak of dengue in the region was when 498 people
were infected around Cairns between 1997 and 1999.

Queensland Health medical entomologist Dr Scott Ritchie said the
cases should remind residents to get rid of mosquito breeding sites
around their homes.

Residents are advised to rid their homes of buckets, pot plants, and
blocked roof gutters that collect water, and to use mosquito
repellants and sprays.
