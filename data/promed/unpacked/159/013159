Avian influenza in France
-------------------------
France last reported an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza to
the OIE in 1948.
Translation of information received on (and dated) 25 Feb 2006 from Dr
Monique Eloit, deputy director general, General Directorate for Food
(DGAL), Ministry of Agriculture, Food, Fisheries and Rural Affairs, Paris:
An outbreak of avian influenza due to highly pathogenic avian influenza
virus subtype H5N1 was reported in a commercial turkey farm in Versailleux
district, Ain department.
Date of 1st confirmation of the event: 25 Feb 2006.
Date of start of the event: 23 Feb 2006.
Nature of diagnosis: clinical and laboratory.
Number of susceptible animals in the outbreak: 11 700 (56-day old turkeys).
Number of cases: 10 500.
Number of deaths: 400.
Number of animals destroyed: 11 300.
Source of outbreak or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive.
Control measures undertaken:
- control of wildlife reservoirs;
- stamping out (total culling of farm poultry was applied on 23 Feb 2006
afternoon);
- quarantine;
- movement control inside the country;
- screening;
- zoning (protection and surveillance zones were delineated around the farm

[This outbreak is located in south eastern France, see map at
<http://eunis.eea.eu.int/sites-factsheet.jsp?tab=0&idsite=200001015&mapType=Standard_B#map>.
The morbidity rate is high, as expected, at 10 500 out of 11 700, or about
90 per cent. Birds are dying, but the mortality rate is truncated and
cannot be accurately calculated, because the birds have been depopulated.
It is possible that if the outbreak were to have run its course, morbidity
and mortality would have reached 100 per cent. However, as much as I like
to get accurate data and track the key epidemiological features of an
outbreak, I am glad the animal health authorities in France jumped on this
quickly. We wish them good luck in stamping out the outbreak. - Mod.PC]
