The Oregon Department of Agriculture (ODA) reported 4 May 2015 that 4 Oregon horses have now tested positive for equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1), with 2 of the horses showing neurologic clinical signs.

Last week [week of 27 Apr 2015] the department announced that a Marion County horse had tested positive for EHV-1 and had developed neurologic signs. The 2nd horse that developed neurologic signs resided at a stable in Polk County with about 40 other horses and was taken to Oregon State University's College of Veterinary Medicine Large Animal Hospital over the weekend [2-3 May 2015]. The Polk County stable has been placed under quarantine and the remaining horses are being monitored by the stable manager and a veterinarian.

In addition to the Polk County stable, 2 Marion County farms remain under quarantine due to EHV-1 exposure. The infected horses and other horses exposed at the quarantined facilities attended an Oregon high school equestrian team meet at the Linn County Fairgrounds on 16-19 Apr 2015.

The ODA is currently investigating the potential of any additional exposures, is working to notify owners of horses that could have been exposed, and has notified Oregon equine veterinarians.

Herpesvirus is a common virus that can lie dormant for long periods of time and then reactivate during a period of stress, which can result in clinical disease. While not transmissible to people, EHV-1 is highly contagious among horses and can cause a variety of ailments in equids, including rhinopneumonitis (a respiratory disease usually found in young horses), abortion in broodmares, and myeloencephalopathy (the neurologic form). In many horses, fever is the only sign of EHV-1 infection, which can go undetected.

In addition to fever, other common signs of EHV-1 infection in young horses include cough, decreased appetite, depression, and a nasal discharge. Pregnant mares typically show no signs of infection before they abort, and abortions usually occur late in gestation (around 8 months), but can be earlier. Abortions can occur anywhere from 2 weeks to several months following infection with EHV-1.

Horses with the neurologic form usually have a fever at the onset of the disease and might show signs of a respiratory infection. A few days later, neurologic signs such as ataxia (incoordination), weakness or paralysis of the fore- and hind limbs, urine retention and dribbling, loss of tail tone, and recumbency (inability to rise) develop.

Oregon State Veterinarian Brad LeaMaster, DVM, PhD, advised horse owners to practice strict biosecurity measures and hygiene if they travel to shows and competitions with their animals. Concerned owners should contact their veterinarian if they have questions.

[This disease can spread fairly fast. It is often recommended to take the animal's temperature at least twice a day to help catch an early rise, which may be the 1st sign of the disease. If there is a rise in resting temperature (1st thing in the morning, before the animals have begun to move around much), then it is advisable to contact your veterinarian immediately.
