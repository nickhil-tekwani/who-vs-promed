The Cache Valley virus may have been responsible for recent abortions in
sheep in central North Dakota.

"Preliminary laboratory investigation implicates the Cache Valley virus,"
says Neil Dyer, director of North Dakota State University's (NDSU)
Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory.

Determining whether Cache Valley was the cause of the abortions is
difficult because the virus is not viable by the time its effects are
noticed, he adds. Diagnosis often requires the demonstration of viral
antibodies in serum or body fluids.

"It has the most detrimental effect on ewes during the 1st trimester of
pregnancy," says Reid Redden, NDSU Extension Service sheep specialist. "Wet
and warm conditions during the late summer and fall of 2010 were just right
to propagate this disease."

Embryonic loss and fetal reabsorption occur in ewes that were infected with
the virus within 30 days after breeding. Ewes infected with the Cache
Valley virus from 30 to 45 days after breeding often will develop various
congenital abnormalities affecting the nervous system, resulting in
abortions, dystocia, weak lambs, stillbirths and lambs with severe
structural deformities.

Lambs born alive are often too weak to survive and die within minutes of
birth. Lambs born to ewes that were infected with the virus after 45 days
of pregnancy may have no adverse effects.

"There is no effective treatment for lambs or ewes after the viral outbreak
has occurred, nor is there a readily available vaccine," Redden says.
"However, ewes that have been exposed to the virus appear to have lifetime
immunity."

The most effective method of protecting ewes from the Cache Valley virus is
to minimize their exposure to mosquito-infested areas during and shortly
after the breeding season.

Numerous other infectious diseases also could result in abortions, as well
as stillbirths and weak lambs, so producers who suspect the Cache Valley
virus is in their flock should consult with their local veterinarian and/or
the NDSU Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory to confirm the diagnosis, Redden
says.

[Cache Valley virus (CVV) is similar to Akabane virus. CVV is a
mosquitoborne member of the Bunyviradae family. The disease is currently
considered endemic in the United States. Clinical signs in sheep include
aborted fetuses, arthrogryposis (limb malformation), brachygnathia (lower
jaw malformation), hydrocephaly (water on the brain), microcephaly (small
brain), and spinal cord hypoplasia (under development) if the lamb is born
alive. Those born alive usually do not survive long. The virus appears to
have a predilection for the neurological tissue. The earlier in gestation
the virus was acquire, the more severe the predilection. Infections between
days 28-32 of gestation usually result in mummification and embryonic loss.

Congenital malformation and detection of the antibodies in the fetal fluids
greatly aid diagnosis. While an absence of antibodies in the dam is
significant, absence of antibody detection in the lamb does not preclude
diagnosis of the disease.

In some areas vaccine is available and it should be used 30-60 days prior
to breeding in an effort to prevent the disease. However, reducing the
insect population, use of insect repellants and moving the flock away from
low lying, water prone areas are also very helpful in preventing the
disease. And some of these measures may be difficult to implement.

Cache Valley virus (CVV), a mosquitoborne member of the Bunyamwera
serogroup, family Bunyaviridae, genus Orthobunyavirus, is geographically
widespread in North America, where it circulates between mosquitoes and
mammals (1). It has previously been associated with only a single case of
human disease, a fatal case of acute encephalitis in the southeastern
United States (2).
