Outbreak of lead poisoning in Nigeria
-------------------------------------
Lead poisoning linked with illegal mining has claimed the lives of
more than 400 infants and over 500 people have been admitted in
hospitals in Zamfara State in northern Nigeria since November [2010],
Nigeria's National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) said today [9
Mar 2011].

The immature body system of children exposed to contaminated soils
and gold processing tools tends to rapidly absorb associated lead and
in the process poisoning then leading to convulsion, paralysis, and
even death.

According to the ministry, most of the victims were children mostly
those who played in contaminated water flowing near the illegal mining
sites. "The children played near the leaching process or took part in
it, swallowing the lead, inhaling it, or putting their contaminated
hands in their mouths," he had said.

[Lead is a metal with no known biological benefit to humans. Too much
lead can damage various systems of the body, including the nervous and
reproductive systems and the kidneys, and it can cause high blood
pressure and anemia. Lead accumulates in the bones, and lead poisoning
may be diagnosed from a blue line around the gums. Lead is especially
harmful to the developing brains of fetuses and young children and to
pregnant women. Lead interferes with the metabolism of calcium and
vitamin D. High blood lead levels in children can cause consequences
which may be irreversible including learning disabilities, behavioral
problems, and mental retardation. At very high levels, lead can cause
convulsions, coma, and death.

People are exposed to lead through the air they breathe, through
water, and through food/ingestion. Toxic effects are usually due to
long-term exposure. The population groups at greatest risk of exposure
are young children and workers. A recent report suggests that even a
blood level of 10 micrograms per deciliter can have harmful effects on
children's learning and behavior (CDC, 2000). People can be exposed to
lead contamination from the motor vehicle exhaust of leaded gasoline,
as well as from industrial sources such as smelters and lead
manufacturing and recycling industries, from cottage industry uses,
and waste sites (such as contaminated landfills).

The effects of lead are the same whether it enters the body through
breathing or swallowing. Lead can affect almost every organ and system
in your body. The main target for lead toxicity is the nervous system,
both in adults and children. Long-term exposure of adults can result
in decreased performance in some tests that measure functions of the
nervous system. It may also cause weakness in fingers, wrists, or
ankles. Lead exposure also causes small increases in blood pressure,
particularly in middle-aged and older people and can cause anemia.
Exposure to high lead levels can severely damage the brain and kidneys
in adults or children and ultimately cause death. In pregnant women,
high levels of exposure to lead may cause miscarriage. High-level
exposure in men can damage the organs responsible for sperm
production.

A blood test is available to measure the amount of lead in your blood
and to estimate the amount of your recent exposure to lead. Blood
tests are commonly used to screen children for lead poisoning. Lead in
teeth or bones can be measured by X-ray techniques, but these methods
are not widely available. Exposure to lead also can be evaluated by
measuring erythrocyte protoporphyrin (EP) in blood samples. EP is a
part of red blood cells known to increase when the amount of lead in
the blood is high. However, the EP level is not sensitive enough to
identify children with elevated blood lead levels below about 25
micrograms/dL. These tests usually require special analytical
equipment that is not available in a doctor's office. However, your
doctor can draw blood samples and send them to appropriate
laboratories for analysis.
