["Equine inﬂuenza (EI) is a highly contagious though rarely fatal respiratory disease of horses, donkeys, and mules and other equidae. The disease has been recorded throughout history, and when horses were the main draft animals, outbreaks of EI crippled the economy. Nowadays outbreaks still have a severe impact on the horse industry.

"EI is caused by two subtypes of inﬂuenza A viruses: H7N7 and H3N8, of the family Orthomyxoviridae. They are related to but distinct from the viruses that cause human and avian inﬂuenza.

"Equine inﬂuenza is a disease listed in the OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Code and countries are obligated to report the occurrence of the disease according to the OIE Code.

"The disease is entrenched in most of the world, with the exceptions of Australia (where an important outbreak occurred in 2007), New Zealand, and Iceland.

"There is little risk to public health. In experimental settings the virus has shown the ability to infect humans, and a few people in contact with infected horses developed antibodies to equine inﬂuenza viruses, but no humans exposed to the virus have become ill."
