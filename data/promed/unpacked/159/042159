The California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) has confirmed outbreaks of adenovirus hemorrhagic disease in deer in several northern California counties and is asking California residents to help curb the spread by not feeding wild animals, and reporting potential cases to the department.

"Providing attractants for deer -- food, salt licks, or even water - is against the law for good reason," said Dr Brandon Munk, senior wildlife veterinarian with CDFW's Wildlife Investigations Laboratory. "Because these artificial attractants can congregate animals and promote the spread of disease, it's particularly imperative to leave wildlife alone during an outbreak. There is no cure or vaccine for this disease, so our best management strategies right now are to track it carefully, and to take preventative measures to limit the spread."

Beginning in May [2021], CDFW began receiving increased reports of mortality in deer, both free-ranging and at fawn rehabilitation facilities. With the assistance of wildlife rehabilitation facilities and the California Animal Health and Food Safety Laboratory, CDFW confirmed cervid adenovirus 1 (CdAdV-1) as the cause of hemorrhagic disease outbreaks this year [2021] in Kern, Napa, and Nevada counties.

The disease is typically fatal to young deer, particularly fawns, and can be spread by animals in close contact with each other. The virus is not known to affect people, pets, or domestic livestock.

CdAdV-1 was the cause of a 1993-1994 outbreak of hemorrhagic disease in black-tailed deer and mule deer that spanned at least 18 California counties. Since then, CdAdV-1 has been identified as the cause of sporadic, often widespread, outbreaks of hemorrhagic disease in California and other western states. Deer fawns are at the greatest risk, with high rates of mortality following infection. Yearlings and adult deer are more resistant but mortalities in these age groups occur as well. Outbreaks can be widespread and may have a significant impact on affected deer populations.

Affected deer are often found dead without any obvious symptoms. They may be found near water. Sick animals may have excessive salivation (drooling or foaming at the mouth), diarrhea, regurgitation, or seizures.

In addition to removing food and other attractants, Californians can help wildlife veterinarians track and study the disease by reporting sightings of sick or dead deer. Anyone who observes a deer exhibiting symptoms, or encountering a deer that has died from unknown causes, can submit the information to CDFW through the department's online mortality reporting system.

["Adenoviruses belong to a small group of viruses that can infect a variety of animals, both wild and domestic. Adenoviruses attack the blood vessels of affected animals. They have a broad range of hosts and cause a wide range of illnesses in humans and animals.

"Adenovirus hemorrhagic disease (AHD) is similar to other hemorrhagic diseases seen in deer including bluetongue and epizootic hemorrhagic disease. _Odocoileus_ adenovirus (OdAdV) infects ungulates like white-tailed and black-tailed deer, moose, and elk with mule deer being severely affected. Fawns are more susceptible to AHD and experience much higher mortality than adults.

"Adenovirus manifests in acute and chronic forms. Clinical signs of the acute form include rapid or open mouth breathing, foaming, or drooling at the mouth, bloody diarrhea, and weakness. Neurologic signs such as seizures can occur. Animals may be found dead with no apparent cause. This disease course is often rapid and fatal.

"Adenovirus transmission can be through direct contact between deer and contact with bodily fluids like saliva, feces, or urine. Spread through airborne routes, contaminated water, and contaminated equipment may also occur. High-density deer populations could have a higher risk for the disease due to the ease of transmission.

"AHD is diagnosed at necropsy with gross findings, histopathology with adenovirus inclusion bodies, and finally PCR from lesions.

"There is no treatment or vaccine for adenovirus hemorrhagic disease."

This adenovirus (CdAdV-1 or OdAdV-1) was first recognized in California in 1993, where it caused fatal hemorrhagic disease in black-tailed deer (_Odocoileus columbianus_). The virus is closely related to bovine adenovirus-3, but the biologic properties of both viruses are clearly distinct and CdAdV-1 does not cause disease in animals other than deer. Mortalities due to CdAdV-1 infection have been documented in black-tailed deer and moose. Wild populations of other cervid species, such as white-tailed deer, mule deer, and elk, are also sporadically infected. - Mod.PMB
