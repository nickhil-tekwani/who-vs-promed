[According to the report above, a total of 82 992 cases of confirmed COVID-19 have now been reported from mainland China, including 4634 deaths, 7 newly confirmed cases in the previous 24 hours (24 May 2020) and no new deaths. All 7 cases are imported cases -- 5 into Inner Mongolia, 1 each into Shanghai and Fujian provinces.

In Hong Kong, where numbers of newly confirmed cases had been reported daily, there were no newly confirmed cases reported in the past 24 hours. Macau also reported no newly confirmed cases. There has been a total of 1731 imported cases reported, an increase of 7 cases since yesterday (24 May 2020).

There were 29 newly confirmed infections in asymptomatic individuals in the past 24 hours; 1 was an imported case and the remaining 28 cases were locally acquired. There were no cases of conversion from asymptomatic to symptomatic in the past 24 hours. The total number of asymptomatic individuals currently under observation (and isolation) is 403 and 28 of these are importations from abroad. I realize mentioning this on a daily basis is repetitious, but it would be helpful to know what proportion of asymptomatic infected individuals went on to be symptomatic in order to start developing projections of actual infection rates and adjust reported case fatality ratios accordingly. It is apparent that there is most likely thorough contact tracing and testing to explain the daily reports of asymptomatic infections in addition to the screening of individuals arriving from overseas.

In a media report from Health Times (26 May 2020), submitted and translated by ProMED-mail Rapporteur Dan Silver (http://www.jksb.com.cn/html/2020/treatment_0525/162867.html) there is the following information about testing in Wuhan:
"Wuhan's nucleic acid screening of all residents has entered its final stages. Health Times learned from statistics issued by the Wuhan Health Commission that, in the 10-day period from (14-23 May 2020), Wuhan completed a total of 6 574 000 people-tests and found a total of 189 asymptomatic infections."

A massive undertaking, but revealing of potential sources of continued transmission of the SARS-CoV-2.

As a reminder, it was reported on 24 Mar 2020 that China ended the lockdown in Hubei and elsewhere, and then ended it in Wuhan on 7 Apr 2020. In the past few weeks, there have been locally transmitted clusters reported in Guangdong, Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Wuhan. The world is watching carefully to see whether this was safe timing to lift the lockdown.

-- There are 30 such facilities including 9 karaoke rooms and 7 bars (as of 10:00 today). Persons who visited such places during the respective specified time period are advised to visit a screening clinic and get tested regardless of symptoms.
* Newly added today: Daeyang Hot Springs Land, Bucheon City, Gyeonggi Province ([17 May 2020], 09:03-13:27; [20 May 2020] 11:06-12:41)

- In light of the upcoming opening of schools on [Wed 27 May 2020] for high school grade 2 (11th grade), middle school grade 3 (9th grade), elementary school grades 1-2, and kindergarten students, KCDC requested students and school staff to closely follow the infectious disease prevention measures.
-- If a confirmed case is found in a school, all students, teachers, and staff of the school will be instructed to put on an MFDS-approved facemask and return home. Local municipal government will conduct epidemiological investigation, disinfection, restriction of use of the affected facility, and other necessary infection control measures.

- In light of the recent rise in local transmissions related to clubs, bars, karaoke rooms, and after-school private academies, KCDC urged people to refrain from social gathering or visiting any enclosed/confined/crowded spaces that are frequented by many people.
-- People who cannot avoid visiting an enclosed/crowded space for an essential reason should carefully follow personal hygiene measures including keeping 2 meters of distance from other people, wearing a facemask, avoiding handshakes, washing hands, and not touching eyes, nose, or mouth with their hands.
-- Persons belonging to high-risk groups (including elderly, pregnant women, persons with chronic illness) should especially avoid any poorly ventilated enclosed space frequented by many people. If such a situation cannot be avoided for an essential reason, it is highly important to wear a facemask.

- Anyone who has come in close contact with a large number of unspecified persons in an enclosed/confined space such as clubs or bars need to be tested at a screening clinic through public health center or 1339 call center.
-- KCDC urged people to visit a screening clinic and get tested especially if two or more persons within a household or social group develop COVID-19 suspected symptoms.

[In the past 24 hours, the tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea has increased by 19 cases and 2 new deaths compared with yesterday's 24-hour period (24 to 25 May 2020) when there were 16 newly confirmed cases and 1 new death. A total of 11 225 confirmed cases and 269 deaths were reported today (25 May 2020), up from 11 206 cases and 267 deaths yesterday (24 May 2020). The daily newly confirmed case count has been at or below 100 for 51 consecutive days and below 50 for 44 consecutive days. For several days, the count was below 10 but started climbing over the last 16 days. In today's (25 May 2020) breakdown of cases, 16 of the cases were locally transmitted, and 3 were imported cases. Locally acquired cases were in Seoul (8), Incheon (3), Gyeonggi (2), and 1 each in Daegu, Chungbuk, and Gyeongbuk. Imported cases were in Quarantine (2) and Seoul (1).

As they move to the next phase -- "distancing in daily life" -- all eyes will be on the country to see whether they can maintain the level of control they have had. Importations continue to be the main problem, but the Itaewon nightclub cluster and now possibly a 2nd club district are major concerns at this time. With these outbreaks associated with club districts in Seoul, there may be a rethinking of the next steps. All individuals with a history of club attendance or other crowded locations are now being encouraged to get tested, even if asymptomatic, recognizing the potential role of asymptomatically infected individuals in transmission of the virus. And the Korean CDC is encouraging no club, bars, or karaoke visits.

[The tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy is now 230 158 cases, including 32 877 deaths, up from 229 858 cases and 32 785 deaths reported on 24 May 2020. The 24-hour change between 24 and 25 May 2020 was 300 newly confirmed cases, compared with 531 newly confirmed cases between 23 and 24 May 2020. The numbers of hospitalized cases and cases in the ICU are also in decline.

Cases still continue to be concentrated in the northern part of the country, in Lombardy, the epicenter of the outbreak, Emilia-Romagna, Veneto, and Piedmont. These 4 provinces combined account for 78.7% of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. Lombardy is the main contributor, representing 49.3% of all newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. Lombardy is the only province reporting more than both 50 and 100 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. 15 provinces reported fewer than 10 newly confirmed cases (5 provinces reported no new cases and Sardinia province subtracted 2 cases) and another 5 provinces reported fewer than 50 newly confirmed cases, all signs of decreasing local transmission. (This may be a weekend artifact, but lower than seen in previous weekends)

There is an excellent interactive map at http://opendatadpc.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/b0c68bce2cce478eaac82fe38d4138b1 to visualize the caseloads per region in near real time.

On 9 Mar 2020, Italy announced a lockdown for the northern provinces, where the outbreak was concentrated. On 10 Mar 2020, this was expanded to be countrywide. On 11 Mar 2020, Italy announced the closure of nonessential businesses. It is now 67 days since the start of the lockdown in the north and 66 days since the countrywide lockdown. The lockdown was extended through 3 May 2020 (see ProMED-mail post 20200411.7211958 for details). All eyes are now on Italy as lockdown restrictions are phased out.

[4] Iran: 137 724 total cases, 7451 deaths
Date: Tue 26 May 2020 03:24 IRDT

https://www.arabnews.com/node/1680066/middle-east


Iran on Monday [25 May 2020] reopened major shrines across the country, more than 2 months after they were closed. At Tehran's Shah Abdol-Azim shrine, worshippers had to wear a mask, walk through a disinfection tunnel and have their temperature checked as they began returning from the early morning, according to AFP reporters. The Imam Reza shrine in Mashhad in northeast Iran and the Fatima Masumeh shrine and Jamkaran mosque in Qom also reopened. They are allowed to open starting from an hour after dawn until an hour before dusk.

Shrines were closed alongside schools, universities, and all nonvital businesses in March [2020] after Iran reported its 1st 2 coronavirus deaths in Qom in late February [2020].

On Monday [25 May 2020], Health Ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour said the total number of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases in Iran had reached 137 724, while the overall number of deaths had risen to 7451. In the past 24 hours, Iran recorded 2032 [?2023] new cases while the number of fatalities stood at 34 -- the lowest daily count recorded since [7 Mar 2020] -- he told a news conference. Experts inside and outside Iran have cast doubt on the country's official figures, and say the real toll could be much higher.

Iran has allowed a phased reopening of its economy and gradual relaxation of restrictions since early April [2020], with a further easing expected in the coming days despite a recent uptick in new cases. "High-risk" businesses such as restaurants, cafes, and wedding halls in Tehran, which were left shuttered, will reopen from Tuesday [26 May 2020], the capital's deputy police chief Nader Moradi told ISNA news agency. Authorities are yet to say when similar measures will be allowed in other provinces.

[In the 24 hours from 24 to 25 May 2020, the total number of cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Iran grew from 135 701 to 137 724 total cases, an increase of 2032 [?2023] compared with 2180 newly confirmed cases reported yesterday (24 May 2020). The number of deaths has increased from 7417 to 7451, an increase of 34 deaths in the 24-hour period. In terms of total numbers of confirmed cases, Iran ranks 11th globally, behind the USA, Brazil, Russia, Spain, the UK, Italy, France, Germany, Turkey, and India (Worldometer data as of 25 May 2020 21:58 EDT (GMT-4)).

As with other countries that are lifting business closures, all eyes are on Iran now that "low risk" businesses are opening, and, unfortunately, it appears as though the opening may have been premature because daily newly confirmed case counts are increasing. The caution is that there is usually a 2- to 3-week lag between increasing cases and increases in reported deaths, so it may be too early to conclude there aren't increases in deaths. If there is heavy travel, there may be a significant increase of COVID-19 cases in the coming 2-4 weeks. Other countries that are rushing to reopen their economies might look at Iran to learn from its experience.

[The above are the latest breakdowns of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the USA, as per Worldometer data. The total number of confirmed cases in the USA and territories is now 1 706 226, including 99 805 deaths, an increase from 1 686 436 cases and 99 300 deaths in the past 24 hours. New York State, with 372 494 (21.8%) cumulative case reports and 1301 (6.6%) newly confirmed cases over the past 24 hours, is still clearly the epicenter of the outbreak in the USA, although case reporting elsewhere is increasing. New York City had a cumulative total of 196 098 as of 13:30 PM EDT on 25 May 2020, including 16 482 confirmed deaths and an additional 4777 probable deaths https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data.page).

With 99 805 cumulative deaths reported today (25 May 2020), and daily newly confirmed deaths exceeding 1000 prior to the past 24 hours,, it is highly likely that the USA will cross the 100 000 threshold tomorrow.

Daily reported case counts are high in California (2382; 12.0%), Illinois (1713; 8.7%), Virginia (1483; 7.5%).

COVID-19 update 116 [data as of 25 May 2020 15:00 CET]
-----------------------------------------------------
Situation in Spain:
Until 10 May 2020, this daily report had been prepared using the data reported in an aggregated form by the autonomous communities. Beginning 11 May 2020, a new strategy for diagnosis, surveillance, and control in the transition phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, in which the autonomous communities must report confirmed cases individually and daily at the State level (central level). Therefore, beginning on 11 May 2020, this information has been used to prepare these daily reports. After combining the data from both surveillance methods, in Spain, at present a total of 235 400 [282 480 - Worldometer accessed 25 May 2020 at 21:00 EDT)] confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 26 837 deaths have been reported to date (Table 1 Table 2, Figure 1 and Figure 2) ). The discrepancies that may appear with respect to data previously reported are a result of the validation of the data by the autonomous communities and the transition to the new surveillance strategy. This discrepancy could persist for several days.

[As per the WHO Situation Report 98 from 27 Apr 2020 (https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200427-sitrep-98-covid-19.pdf and in COVID-19 update (136): UK NHS increased testing, Brazil, WHO 20200428.7274496), Spain has been reporting only PCR-positive confirmations, and not antibody-based tests, to WHO, since 25 Apr 2020. The cumulative antibody-confirmed cases are no longer available in the daily report and are only shown in the graphs. Today (25 May 2020), there was another announcement (see body of report above) of another change in surveillance strategy resulting in the following: information on serology no longer available, and case counts have been adjusted, in most cases in a downward direction. Given that, to facilitate presenting the situation, we will use the data available on the Spanish MOH website but continue to show the Worldometer data as long as it is available. That means comparisons with prior reports will be limited for several days until the new norm becomes full practice.

According to today's report, there were 132 newly confirmed cases (presumably by PCR) in the past 24 hours, bringing the confirmed cumulative total to 235 400, a decrease from yesterday's (24 May 2020) report. A total of 26 837 deaths are reported as of today (25 May 2020), also a decrease from yesterday's (24 May 2020) report.

The countrywide 2-week incidence per 100 000 population is now 14.56 (a slight increase from 24 May 2020 when it was 14.36), a continual slow decrease over the past 28 days from a high of 214.4 on 7 Apr 2020 to 14.56 today (25 May 2020).

Figure 1 at the source URL above shows the daily confirmations juxtaposed with dates of onset of disease, and one clearly sees the trend for decreasing confirmations in recent times. According to Table 2, of the 235 400 cases, an additional 256 cases have been hospitalized, and an additional 11 cases were admitted to ICU. Overall, 9.2% of hospitalized patients have been admitted to ICU.
