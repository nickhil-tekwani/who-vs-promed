[RVF is a zoonotic disease which can cause mortality in people. Over
100 people died in an earlier outbreak in Arabia - see references.
Previous outbreaks in Southern Africa did not cause human illness and
were relatively uncomplicated; OIE Handistatus statistics show 6 new
outbreaks there in 1996 and 2 in 1999. All were stamped out
relatively quickly and all were located in Mashonaland. - PC
