Measles epidemic: Majuro Atoll, Marshall Islands, 13 Jul to 13 Sep 2003
-------------------------------------------------
[A press report dated 7 Aug 2003 was posted on ProMED-mail as a travel
alert on 9 Aug 2003 (reference below). The following public health dispatch
provides an analysis of the outbreak and indicates that vaccination
requirements for travellers are now in force. - Mod.CP]
During the period 13 Jul to 13 Sep 2003, a total of 647 clinically
diagnosed measles cases [defined as a case in a person with fever, a
generalized maculopapular rash, and cough, coryza, or conjunctivitis] were
reported on Majuro Atoll in the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI);
this is the first measles outbreak reported in RMI since 1988. An
additional 74 suspected measles cases are under investigation. This report
describes the clinically diagnosed measles cases and the public health
response to stop the epidemic. Of the 647 cases, 15 (2 per cent) are
laboratory confirmed, either by serology, polymerase chain reaction, or
viral culture. The age of patients ranged from 2 weeks to 43 years (median:
12 years); 479 (74 per cent) patients were aged <20 years. The overall
measles incidence on Majuro Atoll (estimated 2003 population: 25 097) is 26
cases per 1000 population. The incidence is highest among infants aged <1
year (160/1000 population), followed by children aged 1 to 4 years (40/1000).
A total of 58 people with measles have been admitted to hospital; 3
patients have died -- a malnourished child aged 15 months with diarrhea and
pneumonia, a woman aged 27 years with pneumonia, and a woman aged 39 years
whose immediate cause of death remains unknown. Postmortem examination was
not available for any of these patients.
To stop measles transmission, the Ministry of Health in RMI recommended
measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine (MMR) for all infants aged 6 to 11
months and all peeople aged 1 to 40 years who did not have documented proof
of measles immunity [people aged 12 months to 18 years required documented
history of 2 doses of MMR, with the 1st dose administered on or after the
first birthday and the 2nd dose at least 28 days after the first;
otherwise, these people received either their 1st or 2nd dose as indicated.
People aged >18 years required documented history of measles or 1 dose of
MMR administered on or after the 1st birthday; otherwise, these people
received 1 dose of MMR during the vaccination campaign]. As of 13 Sep 2003,
98 per cent of those aged 6 months to 40 years had documentation of receipt
of at least 1 dose of MMR. Campaign activities that delivered 16 913 doses
included; (1) vaccinating health care and public health workers, (2)
vaccinating children at 9 vaccination posts across the atoll, (3) delaying
the start of the school year until schoolchildren were vaccinated and
requiring documentation of vaccination for school entry, and (4) conducting
neighborhood and house-to-house vaccination in areas where adequate
coverage was not reached.
To prevent spread from Majuro Atoll, vaccination campaigns were conducted
in other atolls and islands in RMI. The Ministry of Health suspended travel
of sea vessels and airlines from Majuro Atoll until vaccination campaigns
had been completed in other atolls and islands, and required proof of MMR
vaccination for all travelers leaving Majuro Atoll for other atolls or
islands or for international destinations. 17 measles cases have been
reported from Ebeye Island in Kwajalein Atoll; 10 of these were exposed in
Majuro Atoll. 2 other atolls have reported 6 cases whose exposure was in
Majuro Atoll. Measles surveillance has been enhanced in RMI, other Pacific
islands, and in the United States. Spread to other areas in the Pacific and
to the United States has been limited; 5 measles cases in Hawaii, 3 in
Guam, one in Palau, and one in California are believed to be linked to this
epidemic.
The source of importation of the measles virus to Majuro Atoll has not yet
been determined, but the H1 genotype found in this outbreak is common in
Asia, and the specific strain has been reported recently in measles cases
from Japan and China (1,2). The Advisory Committee on Immunization
Practices recommends that all international travelers be immune to measles
because it is endemic or epidemic in many parts of the world, including
developed countries (3,4). People aged <40 years who are traveling to RMI
during the next 60 days should be aware that RMI requires documentation of
measles immunity for all departing passengers on international flights. The
documentation must fulfill the same age-specific requirements used in the
vaccination campaign.
