Nanaimo rabbit owners are asked to be on high alert after an "extremely infectious and lethal disease" was discovered in the corpses of local rabbits.

The Ministry of Forests, Lands and Natural Resource Operations alerted the public early Friday morning [2 Mar 2018] to the discovery. It was made after tests run on several bunnies found dead on VIU's [Vancouver Island University] Nanaimo campus and in the Rotary Bowl area earlier in the week.

Dr Helen Schwantje, the provincial wildlife veterinarian, told NanaimoNewsNOW rabbit owners need to be incredibly vigilant to make sure their own domesticated rabbits aren't infected.

"I would certainly not advise them walking though the VIU campus with shoes they'd then wear into their home," she said. "Take all precautions necessary in terms of washing their hands, good hygiene, not handle any other rabbits and not release any domestic rabbits into the wild."

She assured pet owners it's only lethal to rabbits; dogs, cats, and humans can't be infected.

This is only the 3rd case of rabbit haemorrhagic disease, caused by the calicivirus, in Canada and the 1st in British Columbia. It's incredibly contagious and spreads quickly through dense rabbit populations, of which Nanaimo has many, especially in the VIU-Rotary Bow area.

Schwantje said it's unclear how the virus, which is used to manage the rabbit populations in Australia and New Zealand, came to be found in Nanaimo's bunnies.

"It came from somewhere, we don't know where," she said.
Leon Davis, manager of the Nananimo SPCA [Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals], said their toxicology reports on the rabbits came back negative and it was "quickly evident" poisoning wasn't a factor in the deaths.

"This is what happens in nature. Eventually, once you hit a certain population level, there's a tipping point and this is one disease you'll see start to take over."

[Rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD) is an extremely lethal and highly contagious disease primarily affecting the European rabbit (_Oryctolagus cuniculus_), and is caused by the RHD virus (RHDV), or rabbit calcivirus. The 1st outbreak of this new disease was reported in 1984 from Jiangsu Province, China, within a group of commercially-bred Angora rabbits imported from Germany. RHDV has since spread worldwide in both domestic and wild populations of _Oryctolagus cuniculus_, and naturally occurring RHD outbreaks have been reported in geographically distant regions, such as Cuba, Uruguay, and Reunion Island.

RHDV is a highly virulent lagovirus endemic in Europe and Australasian populations of the European rabbit. It has also caused several unexplained disease outbreaks in domestic European rabbits in North America.

RHD is characterised by high morbidity and high mortality (70-90 percent), and spreads very rapidly by direct and indirect transmission. Infection can occur by nasal, conjunctival or oral routes.

Transmission of RHD is facilitated by the high stability of the virus in the environment. The incubation period varies from 1 to 3 days, and death usually occurs 12-36 hours after the onset of fever. The clinical manifestations have been described mainly in the acute infection and include nervous and respiratory signs, apathy, and anorexia. Clear and specific lesions, both gross and microscopic, are present. There is primary liver necrosis and massive disseminated intravascular coagulopathy in all organs and tissues. The most severe lesions are in the liver, trachea, and lungs.
