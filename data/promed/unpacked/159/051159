Since the Mukh Mantri Punjab Hepatitis C Relief Fund (MMPHCRF) had started in the state, from [18 Jun 2016], as many as 23 858 cases of hepatitis C have been reported from across the state through [20 Mar 2017].

Sangrur district is at the top in the list with 3550 cases and 1501 patients have taken treatment. The disease has also affected Muktsar (2179 cases), Moga (2011), Tarn Taran (1889), Bathinda (1752) and Mansa with 1402 cases. These patients have applied for free treatment under the program.

Hepatitis C is a liver disease caused by the hepatitis C virus. The virus can cause both acute and chronic hepatitis infection, ranging in severity, from a mild illness lasting a few weeks, to a serious, lifelong illness. According to MMPHCRF programme, free treatment will be provided for the patients suffering hepatitis C. As per health department sources hepatitis C virus is more active in rural area including Malerkotla in Sangrur district. Some villages of Dhuri region are also affected with the virus.

Transmission of the virus include injecting drug use through sharing of syringes and needles and in health care settings due to the reuse or inadequate sterilisation of medical equipment, especially syringes and needles. HCV can also be transmitted by the transfusion of unscreened blood and blood products, sexually, and can be passed from an infected mother to her baby; however these modes of transmission are not common. Hepatitis C is not spread through breast milk, food or water or by casual contact such as hugging, kissing and sharing food or drinks with an infected person.

[Since acute hepatitis C infection is usually quite mild or even asymptomatic, most cases that are diagnosed have likely been infected for some time. Injection drug use is an important risk factor together with --especially in the developing world-- medical procedures done using inadequately sterilized equipment. - Mod.LL
