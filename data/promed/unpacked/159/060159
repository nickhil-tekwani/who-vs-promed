["_Mycobacterium bovis_ is a zoonotic organism and should be treated as a risk/hazard group III organism with appropriate precautions to prevent human infection occurring.

"Bovine tuberculosis is an infectious disease caused by _M. bovis_ that affects cattle, other domesticated animals and certain free or captive wildlife species. It is usually characterised by formation of nodular granulomas known as tubercles. Although commonly defined as a chronic debilitating disease, bovine tuberculosis can occasionally assume a more progressive course. Any body tissue can be affected, but lesions are most frequently observed in the lymph nodes (particularly of the head and thorax), lungs, intestines, liver, spleen, pleura, and peritoneum.

"It should be noted that other members of the _M. tuberculosis_ complex, previously considered to be _M. bovis_, have been accepted as new species despite identical 16s RNA sequences and over 99.9 [%] identity of their genome sequences. These include _M. caprae_(in some countries considered to be a primary pathogen of goats) and _M. pinnipedii _, a pathogen of fur seals and sea lions. These 2 new species are known to be zoonotic. In central Europe, _M. caprae_ has been identified as a common cause of bovine tuberculosis. Disease caused by _M. caprae_ is not considered to be substantially different from that caused by _M. bovis_ and the same tests can be used for its diagnosis.

"In countries with tuberculosis eradication programmes, clinical evidence of tuberculosis in cattle is seldom encountered because the intradermal tuberculin test enables presumptive diagnosis and elimination of infected animals before signs appear. Prior to the national tuberculosis eradication campaigns, however, clinical signs associated with tuberculosis were commonly observed.

"_Mycobacterium bovis_ has been identified in humans in most countries where isolates of mycobacteria from human patients have been fully characterised. The incidence of pulmonary tuberculosis caused by _M. bovis_ is higher in farm and slaughterhouse workers than in urban inhabitants. The transmission of _M. bovis_ to humans via milk and its products is eliminated by the pasteurisation of milk. One of the results of bovine tuberculosis eradication programmes has been a reduction in disease and death caused by bovine tuberculosis in the human population. Although cattle are considered to be the true hosts of _M. bovis_, the disease has been reported in many domesticated and nondomesticated animals. Isolations have been made from buffaloes, bison, sheep, goats, equines, camels, pigs, wild boars, deer, antelopes, dogs, cats, foxes, mink, badgers, ferrets, rats, primates, South American camelids, kudus, elands, tapirs, elks, elephants, sitatungas, oryxes, addaxes, rhinoceroses, possums, ground squirrels, otters, seals, hares, moles, raccoons, coyotes and several predatory felines including lions, tigers, leopards and lynx."
