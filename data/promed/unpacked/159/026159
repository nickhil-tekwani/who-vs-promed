Disease-affected rice fields
----------------------------
With farmers of Upper Siang district facing acute problems in their rice fields following reported breakout of some disease, KVK [agricultural extension center] made an on the spot visit to the various rice fields.

The team found that rice fields are being affected by helminthosporium, leaf spot, and bacterial leaf blight disease in moderate to severe form. Major diseases, symptoms, control measures, [and] precautions were discussed with the farmers.

Keeping in view the seriousness of problems, it is observed that by and large all rice fields are affected by diseases and [this] will cause heavy losses to the farming community.

[Brown spot disease of rice is caused by the fungus _Cochliobolus miyabeanus_ (previously _Helminthosporium oryzae_, _Bipolaris oryzae_). Symptoms include brownish spots on leaves and glumes, as well as blight on seedlings grown from infected seeds with a mortality rate of up to 60 percent. The disease also affects quality, weight, and number of grains per panicle with a yield reduction of up to 45 percent. Leaf spots are thought to be due to a toxin produced by the fungus, and the disease is favoured by a poor nutritional state of the host. Spores are carried on seed and other plant parts. Brown spot is managed by fungicide sprays, seed treatments (hot water, fungicides), but mainly by use of resistant crop varieties.

Bacterial leaf blight (BLB) of rice is caused by _Xanthomonas oryzae_ pv. _oryzae_ with reported yield losses of up to 60 percent. The pathogen causes yellowing and drying of leaves, wilting of seedlings, and blight lesions for severe strains which may also affect panicles. Various saprophytic fungi may invade the lesions, contributing to the damage. BLB is favoured by rain, high levels of fertilizer, high humidity, standing pools of water, and warm temperatures. The bacterium is short-lived in soil and suspected to be seed borne but also to be short-lived in seeds. Grassy weeds, infected plant material such as rice stubble or ratoons, and contaminated irrigation systems are thought to be the primary pathogen reservoirs. The disease spreads by windblown rain and mechanical means (for example when transplanting seedlings or by high insect activity). Disease management includes phytosanitation (control of weed and volunteer rice reservoir hosts, removal of contaminated materials), cultural measures (optimal plant spacing and fertilizers), and use of resistant crop varieties. The related _Xanthomonas oryzae_ pv. _oryzicola_ causes bacterial leaf streak of rice.

It is not clear what disease the other "leaf spot" mentioned above refers to since there are a number of pathogens that can cause leaf spot symptoms in the crop.
