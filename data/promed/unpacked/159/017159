The Nigerian Minister of Health, Prof Onyebuchi Chukwu, has disclosed that cholera outbreak were reported in 17 states of the federation between January and June of 2014, putting the number of accumulated cases at 22 347. Chukwu also said 288 people lost their lives to the endemic disease within the same period. The minister made these known yesterday, 17 Jun 2014, in Abuja at the opening ceremony of a 3-day national workshop on water sanitation, organised by the Nigerian Water and Sanitation Association (NIWASA).

Chukwu, who was represented by the Director of Public Health in the ministry, Mrs Bridget Okoeguale, noted that though the figures were lower than the figures recorded in 2012, Nigeria could do better if adequate sanitation measures were adopted. He added that authorities at the state level often do not report cholera outbreak to the federal government until it becomes unmanageable.

"Cholera has remained one of the major public health challenges in our society, despite our spate of development. No doubt many states refused to report its occurrence to the federal ministry of health, until it gets out of hand. In 2014 alone, as at [week 23] (1 Jan-8 Jun 2014), outbreaks have been reported in 17 states with accumulated cases of 22 347, with 288 deaths," he said. According to the minister, investigations revealed that poor quality of water was responsible for the outbreak and sustenance of the disease in most communities.

"Reports showed that while the outbreak was sustained in Makurdi, Benue State, due to the consumption of polluted water from the Benue River, that of Bauchi continued unabated due to poor hygiene practices and erratic water supply from public water from doubtful sources," he added.

[A new Cochrane Review manuscript has updated the issue of antimicrobials agents in the management of cholera infections (http://www.sciencecodex.com/cochrane_review_effectiveness_of_antimicrobial_drugs_to_treat_cholera-135974):

Researchers from the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group, coordinated through the editorial base in LSTM [Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine], conducted an independent review of the effects of treating cholera with antimicrobial drugs, published in The Cochrane Library today [19 Jun 2014].

Cholera is an acute watery diarrhoea caused by infection with the bacterium _Vibrio cholerae_, which can cause rapid dehydration and death. Effective treatment requires early diagnosis and rehydration using oral rehydration salts or intravenous fluids. This review looked at the effects of adding antimicrobial drugs to this treatment.

39 randomized and quasi-randomized controlled clinical trials were included in the review, with a combined total of 4623 participants, both adults and children. Overall the researchers found that antimicrobial therapy shortened the average duration of diarrhoea by about [1.5 days] when compared to placebo or no treatment. Antimicrobial therapy also reduced the total stool volume by 50 percent and reduced the amount of rehydration fluids required by 40 percent, and shortened the duration of fecal extraction of vibrios bacteria by almost 3 days.

There was substantial variation between trials in the size of these benefits, probably due to differences in the antimicrobial agent used, the trial methods (particularly effective randomization), and the timing of outcome assessment. However the benefits of antibiotics were seen both in trials recruiting only patients with severe dehydration and in those recruiting patients with mixed levels of dehydration.

In direct head-to-head comparisons, researchers found that there were no obvious differences detected in diarrhea duration or stool volume for tetracycline compared to doxycycline or tetracycline compared to ciprofloxacin or norfloxacin. However, a higher number of studies looked at indirect comparisons and in those cases tetracycline appeared to have larger benefits than doxycycline, norfloxacin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, while single dose azithromycin shortened the duration of diarrhea by over a day compared to ciprofloxacin and by half a day compared to erythromycin. Tetracycline was not compared with azithromycin.

Ya'ara Leibovici-Weissman from Tel Aviv University said: "In treating cholera a quick and accurate diagnosis remains key, but it is clear from the results that antimicrobials result in substantial improvements in clinical and microbiological outcomes, with similar effects observed in severely and non-severely ill patients. Our results also point to the likelihood that azithromycin and tetracycline may have some advantages over other antibiotics."
