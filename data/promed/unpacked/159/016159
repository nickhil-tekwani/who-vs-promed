Earlier this year [2007], during the height of the epizootic
hemorrhagic disease (EHD) outbreak in whitetail deer in western
Kentucky, the staff at Murray State University Breathitt Veterinary
Center, a veterinary diagnostic laboratory in Hopkinsville, KY,
received numerous calls from veterinarians in our service area who
were being called to attend to cows affected with clinical signs
similar to those detailed above, namely: pyrexia, stiffness
(laminitis/coronitis), ulceration of the dental pad and lingual
mucosa, "burned"/cracked skin on muzzle and udder, nasal discharge,
diarrhea. I am personally aware of a minimum of 6 affected animals
that died, though none of those were submitted for necropsy examination.

Numerous serum samples from affected cattle were tested for EHD and
bluetongue (BT) virus antibodies over the following several weeks,
with virtually 100 percent being seropositive for EHD and
approximately 50 percent also being seropositive for bluetongue antibodies.

Virus isolation from tissues of affected deer on BHK-21 and BPAE
cells was readily accomplished, and EHD virus was successfully
isolated from whole blood (EDTA) samples and clots from serum tubes
from cattle that were affected with clinical signs suggestive of EHD.

So it is clearly evident that cattle can, indeed, be infected with
EHD virus and that EHD virus can cause clinical disease in cattle, as
shown by the lesions and clinical signs observed.

Additionally, USDA-APHIS was notified of these affected animals, and
due to the resemblance of the clinical lesions observed to those of
vesicular diseases such as foot and mouth disease (FMD) and vesicular
stomatitis (VS), USDA-APHIS personnel conducted Foreign Animal
Disease investigations on several Kentucky and Tennessee farms,
collecting samples from affected animals, which were then submitted
to the Plum Island Animal Disease Center and the National Veterinary
Services Laboratory. Reports which were subsequently forwarded to
MSU-BVC indicate that all animals tested were PCR-negative for FMD,
VS, and BT but were PCR-positive for the presence of EHD virus.

[This moderator wishes to thank Dr. Pittman for the personal
communication regarding EHD in cattle and providing the test results
from several cases. The clinical signs in animals clearly make this a
disease to be differentiated from foot and mouth disease. - Mod.TG]
