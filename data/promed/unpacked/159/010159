The dreaded chikungunya has arrived in the capital, with one case of
the mosquito-borne disease afflicting a woman.
It was detected in a patient aged 36, who had come to RML hospital
last week, Delhi Health Secretary D S Negi said.
He said the blood sample of the woman from Paharganj was sent to the
National Institute of Communicable Disease and tested positive for
chikungunya [virus or antibody? - Mod.TY]. This is the 1st reported
case of chikungunya [virus infection] in the capital this year [2007].
Last year [2006], around 40 people in the capital had contracted the
virus, while a total of 1695 people from across the country tested
positive for the disease.
The national capital has had only 4 cases of Dengue so far this summer [2007].
