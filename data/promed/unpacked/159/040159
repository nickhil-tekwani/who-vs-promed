In reply to Steve Grenard's posting of 23 Mar 97:
As a biologist closely involved with the investigation of ill and dead frogs
in southeast Queensland, Australia, I would like to clarify or correct a
number of statements in the posting and in the original article by "The
Weekend Independent".
1. There are about 50 species of frogs in southeast Queensland, 100 in the
whole State and about 200 in Australia. Six of Queensland's frogs, from
montane rainforest streams, have not been seen in the wild for a number of
years. A number of other species from similar habitats declined at the same
time. The cause of their rapid decline and disappearance remains unknown.
2. Since May 1996 a "wave" of deaths affecting at least six species was
observed in southeast Queensland and adjoining northern New South Wales.
These species were from a range of environments from the heavily populated
coastal plains to more or less undisturbed montane rainforests. Ongoing
monitoring suggests that the 'wave' passed by
December 1996. There is only limited data on which to assess the
significance of this event, but it appears that in some local populations at
least 50% of adult frogs were affected. It is not known to what extent
smaller and/or more cryptic species were affected.
3. Specimens collected from the recent wave of deaths have been sent to the
Australian Animal Health Laboratory for extensive pathological
investigations. Apart from 2 specimens (one with a fungal infection, the
other with a protozoan infestation of the brain) the cause of death remains
unknown. Investigations are continuing, focusing on toxins, viruses and a
skin protozoan. A lack of knowledge on frog disease, both globally and in
Australia, is hampering efforts. It is not known whether the same agent is
responsible for the other illness and deaths.
4. The "wave" of deaths highlighted our lack of basic quantitative data on
frog populations, even for common and widespread species, and the difficulty
in rapidly assessing the significance of, and responding to, such events.
The Queensland and Northeastern New South Wales Threatened Frogs Recovery
Team is overseeing a number of projects aimed at addressing these issues;
some funding has been received from the Federal government.
