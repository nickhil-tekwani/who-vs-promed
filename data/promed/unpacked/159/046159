Resetting the yellow fever strategy
-----------------------------------
Changes in the way humans live and work, and the resurgence of mosquito vectors, particularly the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito (which spreads Zika, dengue fever and chikungunya), have raised the global risk of yellow fever. The 2 large yellow fever outbreaks in Angola and Democratic Republic of the Congo are now under control but these are just warnings of bigger outbreaks to come if action is not taken.

A coalition of partners working to stop yellow fever outbreaks met in Geneva on 12 Sep 2016 to develop a new strategy -- Eliminating Yellow fever Epidemics (EYE). This strategy aims to protect the populations most at risk, ensure a ready supply of yellow fever vaccine, build resilience in urban centres and prevent international spread.

[Clearly, approaches to effective, rapid response to outbreaks of yellow fever (YF) and other diseases is necessary, and the World Health Organization has recognized this need in their 12 Sep 2016 meeting. ProMED-mail subscribers who have been following the YF outbreak in Africa, are interested in YF in general or in emergency response to disease outbreaks are urged to view the video associated with this report. - Mod.TY]
