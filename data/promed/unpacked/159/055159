Fungal disease hits garlic production
-------------------------------------
Garlic farmers, a major crop in Kanthallur (Idukki district), have suffered heavily due to a fungal disease that spread widely a month before the harvest season began. Almost 40 hectares [about 100 acres] of land are under garlic cultivation in Kanthallur.

There is a considerable drop in production and the size of the bulbs is very small. The worst affected are those who cultivated the high quality Mettupalayam variety.

According a farmer, the main reason for the crop loss was that the misty rain, a feature of the rain shadow area of Kanthallur, failed in June and July [2015].

[A number of fungi can affect garlic (_Allium sativum_) as well as onion (_A. cepa_), including _Botrytis_, _Penicillium_, _Sclerotium_, and _Peronospora_ species causing rotting, decay, or mildew symptoms. Most of the major diseases of this crop are soil borne.

Reliable diagnosis of the cause and/or pathogen(s) associated with the problems reported above is needed before any management strategies can be designed.
