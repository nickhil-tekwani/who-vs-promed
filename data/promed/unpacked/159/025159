Many food poisoning cases reported in Algerian event halls
-----------------------------------------------------------
Data published by the Algerian ministry of trade regarding food
poisoning shows that 46 percent of cases registered by the Algerian
general administration for quality control were caused by eating in
event halls, while 26 percent of them were caused after eating in
public restaurants and 11 percent in university restaurants.
The 11 Jul 2005 edition of Al-Khabar newspaper quoted Mr. Ramadan
from the Algerian general administration for quality control as
explaining that the high portion of food poisoning in event halls is
caused by the fact that the food there is usually prepared in the
morning and served only in the evening.
As for the kinds of food which cause the poisoning, 24 percent were
meat and its products, 23 percent was couscous, and 22 percent were
sweets [desserts].

[This report from Algeria clearly demonstrates the need for adequate
refrigeration of event food. It would be interesting to know if the
etiologies of the food poisonings were different related to the
different kinds of foods or sources of the food. - Mod.LL]
