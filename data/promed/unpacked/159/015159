The Sicilian doctor could have died of _P.falciparum_ malaria 17 to 20 days
after a needlestick infection. That time period would be short had infection
been by a mosquito bite - with the need for parasites to develop and multiply
in the liver (?? 7 to 9 days minimum) before being released into the blood
(one generation every 36 hours or so). But with direct inoculation of blood
forms into his blood there would have been time for about 12 generations,
with massive multiplication each time.
However, one would want to be sure that the diagnosis was correct
(identification of parasites on microscopy by an experienced person) and that
there was no other source from which the doctor could have been infected (a
local or imported _Anopheles_ mosquito which had fed on an infected person
three weeks or more before biting the doctor).
