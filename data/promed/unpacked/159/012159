The prefecture of Bas-Rhin reports that 22 cases of legionellosis have been diagnosed since 1 Nov 2019 in patients aged 42-88 years living in the west of the agglomeration of Strasbourg (Strasbourg Ouest, Lingolsheim, Ostwald).

Two people have died, 18 people have been cured or are recovering, and 2 recent hospitalizations are being assessed. This situation directs epidemiological investigations towards the search for a common source of contamination that is not known to date.

Legionellosis is not spread from person to person. Contamination occurs through the respiratory system, by inhalation of contaminated water released into an aerosol.

In 2018 in the department of Bas-Rhin, 48 cases of legionellosis were declared, among which 5 people died. In 2019, as of 16 Dec, 71 cases of legionellosis were declared across the department, including the present cluster of cases, and 7 people died.

[Legionellosis is caused by various species of _Legionella_, most commonly _Legionella pneumophila_. Legionnaires' disease is the acute pneumonic form of legionellosis, and Pontiac fever is the non-pneumonic form. Humans acquire Legionnaires' disease after exposure to natural or man-made aquatic reservoirs, usually by means of inhalation of aerosolized _Legionella_ bacteria, but the disease can also be acquired by aspiration of _Legionella_-contaminated potable water in people prone to aspirate, such as debilitated hospitalized patients. Possible person-to-person transmission of Legionnaires' disease has also been described (Correia AM, Goncalves J, Gomes, JP, et al.: Probable person-to-person transmission of Legionnaires' disease. N Engl J Med. 2016; 374: 497-8; http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc1505356). _Legionella_ infection can be acquired less commonly by contamination of wounds.

Water temperatures of 25-40 deg C (77-104 deg F) support the highest concentrations of the organism in plumbing systems. Aerosolization of the contaminated warm water can be generated by showerheads, spa pools and hot tubs, and misting sprays in outdoor event spaces, and in grocery departments, fountains, cooling towers, and car washes.

Aerosols can spread for distances outdoors, wafted in air currents downwind from their source. In fact, "Broad Street pneumonia" was described in people who were passing by on Broad Street in front of a Philadelphia hotel, but who had never entered the hotel where there was an ongoing Legionnaires' disease outbreak during a Pennsylvania Legionnaires' convention in 1976 (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00045731.htm).

Genotyping of clinical isolates of _Legionella_ can help identify a cluster of cases with a common source if the genotypes of clinical isolates match. Genotyping of environmental isolates of _Legionella_ can help identify the source for the cluster of cases if the environmental genotype matches the genotype of the clinical isolates. More information on the outbreak in Bas-Rhin would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources.

Bas-Rhin is a department in northern Alsace (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bas-Rhin). Alsace is a historical region in eastern France, on the west bank of the upper Rhine next to Germany and Switzerland (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alsace). Strasbourg, located at the border with Germany, is the capital of the Bas-Rhin department and is the official seat of the European Parliament.
