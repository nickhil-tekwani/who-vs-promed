If Lyme disease isn't reason enough to avoid ticks, here's another: the inability to enjoy a burger. Odd as it seems, researchers say that bites from the voracious lone star tick are making some people allergic to red meat -- even if they've never had a problem eating it before.

The allergic reactions range from vomiting and abdominal cramps to hives to anaphylaxis, which can lead to breathing difficulties and sometimes even death. Unlike most food allergies, the symptoms typically set in 3 to 6 hours after an affected person eats beef, pork or lamb -- often in the middle of the night. The bite that seems to precipitate it may occur weeks or months before, often making it difficult for people to make the link.

Cases of the unusual allergy were 1st identified at the University of Virginia at Charlottesville, Virginia in 2007, and are now being reported as far north as Nantucket, Massachusetts, and on the east end of New York's Long Island.

"It's a huge problem out here," says Erin McGintee, a pediatric and adult allergist in East Hampton, New York, who says she knows of more than 70 cases and sees several more each week. "I've been trying to get the word out -- but there are still a lot of people who don't believe it," she adds.

[It seems that in some tick-endemic areas, this association is being increasingly recognized. One relevant study was published in 2011: Commins SP, James HR, Kelly LA, et al. The relevance of tick bites to the production of IgE antibodies to the mammalian oligosaccharide galactose-alpha-1,3-galactose. J Allerg Clin Immunol. 2011;127: 1286-1293. The abstract can be found in ProMED-mail: Lone star tick - USA: link to meat allergy 20120623.1178567.

It has been known for several decades that an immunological reaction occurs to tick salivary antigens in animals fed on by the tick. Indeed, a large amount of research has been published regarding the protection of humans and animals from tick-borne diseases by immunization with tick antigens which may block the ability of the tick to transmit infection (for a review, see: Lee R, Opdebeeck JP: Arthropod vaccines, in New Vaccines and New Vaccine Technologies, Lutwick LI (ed), Infect Dis N Am 1999;13: 209-226).

This study came about related to the monoclonal antibody cetuximab, which is specific for epidermal growth factor receptor, and was approved for use in treating cancer in 2005. Subsequently, it became clear that a significant number of treated patients were experiencing severe hypersensitivity reactions during their 1st infusion of this monoclonal antibody. Those reports appeared to be restricted to an area of the southeastern USA, including Tennessee, North Carolina, Arkansas, Virginia, and the southern half of Missouri. In 2007, a detailed investigation of serum antibodies established that these reactions were occurring in patients who had preexisting IgE antibodies specific for the glycosylation on the Fab fragment of the monoclonal antibody. The relevant oligosaccharide was found to be galactose-alpha-1,3-galactose (alpha-gal), which is a blood group substance of nonprimate mammals.

Of note, the known distribution of the immediate reactions to cetuximab was similar to the areas with high prevalence of Rocky Mountain spotted fever and human ehrlichiosis. The authors of the paper became aware of patients who thought that reactions to red meat started after receiving multiple tick bites, and were informed that several allergists had reported to their local allergy meetings about patients who had become allergic to meat after experiencing multiple tick bites.

Diseases linked to _A. americanum_ include erlichiosis, tularemia and STARI (Southern Tick-Associated Rash Illness, http://www.cdc.gov/stari/disease/). Pictures of the lone star tick, including one of engorging female _A. americanum_ ticks, can be found at: http://www.tickinfo.com/lonestartick.htm.

It is increasingly clear that the same delayed (3-6 hours) IgE mediated hypersensitivity from meat can be associated with other ticks such as _Ixodes holocyclus_ in Australia (1) and _I. ricinus_ in Sweden (2) and Spain (3); and not only can beef be an issue, but also lamb, pork and game (1). Additionally, alpha-gal has been identified in the gastrointestinal tract of ticks (2). The curious delayed nature of a usually rapid onset immune reaction may be explained by the slower absorption of the alpha-gal expressing glycoproteins transported with dietary triglycerides (4).
