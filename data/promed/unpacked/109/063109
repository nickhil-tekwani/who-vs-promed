A highly contagious and "lethal viral disease" is spreading among rabbits at a Utah park -- and it prompted a warning for tourists. Visitors to Dinosaur National Monument in Utah could see more dead rabbits than usual at the park, the National Park Service said Wednesday [6 Apr 2022].

Rabbit hemorrhagic disease, also known as RHDV2, was found in wild cottontail rabbits inside the park in Uintah County, officials said. Park visitors need to stay away from any dead or sick rabbits they may find. "The virus does not infect humans, but other causes of illness and mortality in rabbits can," park officials said in a news release. "The public is instructed to remain cautious and to follow the instructions ... to protect themselves, pets, and rabbits in this area."

Tourists who see dead or sick rabbits should tell monument staff, park officials said. They shouldn't touch or move the rabbits. Dogs also should be kept on a leash and shouldn't interact with the rabbits. Dead rabbits must be disposed of with special protective equipment. Park rangers need to know when the rabbit was found, its species, and the specific location of the carcass. A photo is also helpful, officials said.

The virus isn't related to COVID-19, and it can't spread to humans. However, it is a "serious disease" for rabbits or could be a sign of other problems. "Multiple dead or sick rabbits can also be a sign of tularemia or plague, which are diseases that can cause serious illness in people," park officials said. "Do not handle sick or dead wildlife, and do not allow pets to contact or consume wildlife carcasses."

[In the 1980s, populations of the European rabbit (_Oryctolagus cuniculus_) were devastated by a virus that caused an extremely lethal and highly contagious disease, rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD). The 1st outbreak of this new disease was reported in 1984 in the Jiangsu Province of China within a group of commercially-bred Angora rabbits imported from Germany. As the virus spread worldwide, naturally occurring RHD outbreaks were reported in geographically distant regions, such as Cuba, Uruguay, and Reunion Island.

RHD is a highly pathogenic lagovirus endemic in Europe and Australasian populations of the European rabbit, _Oryctolagus cuniculus_. It has also caused several unexplained disease outbreaks in domestic European rabbits in North America. The disease has also spilled to wild cottontail rabbits and jackrabbits.

RHD is characterised by high morbidity and high mortality (70-90%) in European rabbits and spreads very rapidly by direct and indirect transmission. Infection can occur by nasal, conjunctival, or oral routes.

Transmission of RHD is facilitated by the high stability of the virus in the environment. Lesions are primary liver necrosis and a massive disseminated intravascular coagulopathy in all organs and tissues. The most severe lesions are in the liver, trachea, and lungs.

In 2010, a new genotype of RHD (RHD-2) emerged, and where it propagated it replaced the original strain. This new variant causes lethal infections also in juvenile (< 2 months old) and RHD vaccinated rabbits. After its 1st detection in France, RHD-2 spread rapidly and infections were reported in several European countries, North America, the Middle East, and Australia. - Mod.PMB
