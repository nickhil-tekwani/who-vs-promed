Some of the information in the recent posting about bovine anaplasmosis in the USA is inaccurate and incomplete. As a veterinary pathologist who has worked on researching various aspects of bovine anaplasmosis for more than 10 years, I would like to correct a couple of inaccuracies and add my 2 cents worth in regards to the posting from the American Thinker [referenced above].

First, the article confounds 2 different pathogens. _Anaplasma marginale_, causes bovine anaplasmosis referred to as bovine "yellow fever" in the posting. _A. marginale_ does not infect humans. _A. phagocytophilum_ has been detected in cattle, particularly in Europe, but more typically infects small ruminants, horses, and is a human pathogen. In humans the disease caused by _A. phagocytophilum_ is called human granulocytic ehrlichiosis.

Second, _A. marginale_ infects cattle for life, however, many animals remain clinically normal and never develop disease. Thus, serosurveys that detect antibodies to _A. marginale_ give an accurate indication of the prevalence of infection but give no indication of the actual disease burden. Rigorous surveillance programs enumerating the burden of disease and death due to _A. marginale_ are required to fill this critical knowledge gap.

Last, bovine anaplasmosis can present as unexpected death in groups of animals or an occasional sick animal or 2 in a herd. Because _A. marginale_ lives in the red blood cells, the major clinical signs are referable to anemia. In severe cases, the animals may develop icterus, thus the "yellow fever", in other cases the animals do not become icteric. Much of the information concerning bovine anaplasmosis is dated and there is quite a lot of mythology surrounding this disease. It is possible, and perhaps likely, that animals developing icterus are infected with other pathogens or are experiencing stress for other reasons. One important step toward understanding the current disease burden due to bovine anaplasmosis is to do the appropriate diagnostic tests, particularly blood smears.

Blood smears are simple and inexpensive and will help confirm _A. marginale_ as the cause of illness or death because infected red blood cells are numerous and easy to identify in clinical cases of bovine anaplasmosis. In persistently infected animals dying of other causes, infected red blood cells will be much less numerous. Importantly, blood smears will also rule-out the presence of other hemoparasites that can also cause hemolytic crises, which is critically important in understanding our current, dynamic situation and helping come up with solutions to this problem for cattle producers.

The cited article authored by Chriss Street and sourced from American Thinker on [3 Jun 2019] regarding bovine anaplasmosis in the United States was riddled with inaccuracies and misleading statements. Importantly, the causative agents of bovine anaplasmosis (_Anaplasma marginale_) and human granulocytic anaplasmosis (_A. phagocytophilum_) are separate organisms, with different biological vectors and different host ranges, and which infect different cell types within the host. _A. marginale_ does not infect humans and does not present risk of spreading to people from cattle, as the article stated. This article implied that the CDC has collected data on bovine anaplasmosis and warned of a "widespread epidemic;" however, the CDC does not collect data or report on diseases solely regarded as veterinary diseases, such as bovine anaplasmosis. In addition, the range of human granulocytic anaplasmosis follows that of its biological vector, _Ixodes scapularis_, which is prevalent mostly in the Northeast, not the litany of states mentioned in the article. Lastly, a statement included by the ProMED moderator implied that ticks were not the most important vectors of anaplasmosis in some locations, suggesting instead that haematophagous flies were to blame. Scoles et al. have published data suggesting that ticks, as compared to biting flies, are much more efficient vectors of bovine anaplasmosis.

The source material for this ProMED post was an online publication known for peddling conspiracy theories and pseudoscience. More care should be taken by ProMED to verify sources and moderate content, in order to decrease the spread of falsehoods regarding medical information.

[I must heartily thank Susan for her informed and authoritative correction. Most appreciated and welcome. I must admit to feeling mildly guilty as I had worked on the disease many years ago but time has dulled my memory for scientific facts. Another lesson to take from this is that not all journals are equally reliable and take note when a report on a livestock disease has a medical public health tag. And remember that diagnoses of cause of death can be confused with chronic infections as death with can be falsely lumped with death from.

And also the Burcham trio for their fair comments. Apropos one of the strengths of ProMED is the willingness of its members to jump in with comments. But while ticks may be more efficient in transmitting this pathogen, you have to have ticks to do it. Thanks to fire ants we lack ticks and so this pathogen has to survive in this part of the US using other methods, one of which are haematophagous flies. - Mod.MHJ
