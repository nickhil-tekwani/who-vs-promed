Preliminary tests on a dead goose and 2 dead ducks found in Sha Lo
Wan, Lantau Island [Hong Kong] have indicated a suspected case of H5
avian influenza, the Agriculture, Fisheries & Conservation Department
says. More tests are being conducted.

The carcasses of a goose and duck were collected on 29 Jan 2009 on a
beach near Sha Lo Wan football pitch. Today, department staff
collected another dead duck at the same location. There are no
poultry farms within 3 km of the area.

This morning [1 Feb 2009], department staff inspected the beach and
the nearby villages of Sha Lo Wan Tsuen and Sha Lo Wan San Tsuen.
There was no evidence of any backyard poultry being kept there.

The department is looking into why the carcasses were found at the
beach, including whether they had been washed ashore or dumped.

The Centre for Health Protection contacted 6 members of the public
who reported the incident and 12 staff involved in the operation of
collecting dead birds. 17 of them are asymptomatic and have been put
under medical surveillance.

The 26-year-old driver who had participated in collecting the dead
birds on 29 Jan 2009 has developed fever and symptoms of upper
respiratory infection since 27 Jan 2009. As he developed symptoms 2
days before the operation, the chance of him being infected with avian
flu is low. However, as a precautionary measure, he has been admitted
to the Princess Margaret Hospital for observation and further
investigation.

[Hong Kong was the site of the very 1st case of human infection with
HPAI H5N1, in August 1997. Since then, the HK government has been
applying the following exemplary measures to reduce the risk of
infection spreading from poultry to humans:

(a) vaccination of chickens in local farms and imported chickens;
(b) regulation of local farms including tightened biosecurity
measures (for example, all farms should be [wild] bird-proof);
(c) import control (for instance, imported chickens must come from
registered farms with health certificates);
(d) segregation policy (no waterfowl, which are natural carriers of
avian influenza viruses, can be sold in retail outlets);
(e) market rest days to break the virus cycle and reduce the viral load;
(f) hygiene requirements on wholesale market and retail outlets; and
(g) surveillance targeted at humans, poultry and wild birds to ensure
timely detection of the presence of any avian influenza viruses in
our environment.

The said measures and additional background information are described
in the document "Hong Kong's preparedness for influenza pandemic -
Prevention and Protection," which is included, with additional
updated information, in Hong-Kong's website "Prevention of Avian
Influenza," available at
<http://www.info.gov.hk/info/flu/eng/index.htm>.

[From the context it appears that these waterfowl could be either wild
or domestic species. Identification as one or the other would be
important. - Mod.JW]
