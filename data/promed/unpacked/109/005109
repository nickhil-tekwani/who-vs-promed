The Food Standards Agency and Health Protection Agency (HPA) are
investigating a recent increase in the number of cases of a certain
type of _Salmonella_ in England and Wales. The increase in cases of
_Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Enteritidis phage type (PT) 14b,
since mid-August 2009, was noted by the HPA as part of its monitoring
of infectious diseases.

A total of 443 cases of _S._ Enteritidis PT14b have been reported to
the HPA in 2009, compared with 137 cases in 2008. 14 clusters of cases
in England and Wales are currently being investigated to determine if
there is a common source of infection. A total of 144 cases of _S._
Enteritidis PT14b have been associated with these 14 clusters.

The clusters have been linked to a number of different catering
establishments and a care home. Although there is no conclusive
evidence yet, the clusters may be linked to eggs sourced from outside
the UK and used in these establishments. Investigations are ongoing
into a possible link to eggs sourced from an approved establishment in
Spain, and the UK and Spanish authorities are working in close
cooperation to investigate this.

In the meantime, the Agency is reminding caterers and other food
businesses how to cook and prepare eggs safely. Since January 2009,
all EU member states are required to have a _Salmonella_ National
Control Program and carry out testing for the organism in laying
flocks. Although this program intends to reduce the incidence of
_Salmonella_ in laying flocks and the egg market, it cannot guarantee
complete absence. Eggs from flocks testing positive for the organism
(specifically _S._ Enteritidis or _S._ Typhimurium) are not allowed to
be sold directly to consumers. Most of these eggs are instead sent for
pasteurization.

_Salmonella_ is one of the most common causes of food poisoning in the
UK and is sometimes found in unpasteurised milk, raw meat and poultry,
as well as eggs and products containing raw egg. The majority of eggs
on sale in shops in the UK are of UK origin, and recent surveys have
shown there is a very low incidence of salmonella in UK eggs. Even so,
it isn't possible to guarantee that any egg will be free from
_Salmonella_, whatever the source or brand. Therefore it is important
that people continue to take care to ensure the safe storage,
preparation, and cooking of eggs.
