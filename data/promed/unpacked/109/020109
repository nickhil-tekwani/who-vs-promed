In 2006, the total number of cases was 10 000, according to Sabq, quoting relevant medical sources. The source said that the main reason behind the current spread of dengue fever is the early seasonal beginning of heat and humidity which causes mosquitoes to venture inside homes where they can find shade. During this period, the use of air-conditioners is prolonged which leads to an accumulation of water in flower vases and other dishes, particularly where expatriate workers live.
