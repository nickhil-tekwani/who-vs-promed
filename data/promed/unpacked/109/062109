Brazil (Minas Gerais): Death of Farm Worker from Hantavirus Infection
---------------------------------------------------
The Regional Director of Health of Passos and the Municipal Secretary of
Health of Sao Tomas de Aquino confirm the death from hantavirus infection
of a 37-year-old farm laborer at the beginning of December 2002. He had
been to the first aid station in Sao Tomas de Aquino in the south of Minas
Gerais 12 days after his first symptoms appeared. The material collected
from the victim was sent to Belo Horizonte. The Regional Director of Health
of Lavras confirmed the diagnosis. The owner of the farm where the victim
worked had no comment. Since the beginning of the week, a team of
specialists from the Regional Director of Health of Passos and of
Eco-Vigilancia for Hantavirus of Uberaba has been visiting the city to
investigate the source of the infection, and to educate the people on
prevention of the disease. In Minas Gerais state, the regions of highest
incidence of hantavirus infections are the south and the Triangulo Mineiro.

[Hantaviruses are transmitted through the urine and feces of wild rodents,
and the principal symptoms are fever, severe headache, muscle pains, and
respiratory and renal problems. Each species of hantavirus has a
distinctive rodent host. At least 3 different hantaviruses, _Juquitiba
virus_, _Ararquara virus_, and _Castelos dos Sonhos virus_, have been
associated with cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in Brazil (see:
Johnson, A.L., et al., Journal of Medical Virology 59, 527-535, 1999).
Information on the identity of the virus and the specific rodent host
responsible for this fatal case of hantavirus infection in Minas Gerais
would be appreciated. - Mod.CP]
