The 1st case of Japanese encephalitis in Yunlin County was reported to the public on [Sat 28 Jul 2018] and served as a moment for the health department to urge the public to be aware that Taiwan is entering peak season for the virus.

A 52-year-old man contracted the disease at the end of June [2018]. The man had a high temperature, confusion, and a feeling of weakness. The man was not vaccinated and is currently in the hospital, reports say.

The Japanese encephalitis virus is spread via mosquitoes, with pigs and birds serving as a holder of the virus. Vaccines are a safe and effective counter. The vaccine for the virus was 1st included in Taiwan's routine vaccine regime in 1968.

Those most at risk to the virus are people over the age of 40. Typical symptoms include headaches, vomiting, confusion, fever, and seizures. The peak season for Japanese encephalitis in Taiwan is May-October.

The health department investigated the illness by visiting the man's home, workplace, and other frequented places. The investigation found that 3 pigs were kept close to his home, and this environment posed a high risk.

In a bid to reduce the mosquito colony near the man's house, 8 mosquito lamps were erected, reported Economic Daily.

The health department recommends that people who frequent high-risk areas like pigsties or paddy fields make an effort to keep their vaccination up to date, said the head of Yunlin County's Public Health Bureau, Wu Chao-chun, reported the Economic Daily.

As of [Sat 21 Jul 2018], there have been 31 recorded cases of the virus in Taiwan, according to the [Taiwan] Centers for Disease Control. The majority of cases have been recorded in southern or central Taiwan.

According to the Liberty Times, 94.95 percent of the public are currently vaccinated against the virus. The vaccination can be administered at local health centers.

[The above case is the 1st one in Yunlin County, with 31 in Taiwan this year. The Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) transmission season is now well underway in Taiwan. We expect cases to occur sporadically until the transmission season ends in October 2018. The mosquito species, _Culex tritaeniorhynchus_, is an efficient vector of JEV and breeds in wet areas such as rice paddies. These culex mosquitoes are abundant enough there to accomplish transmission of the virus from birds and swine to people. Vector control is difficult.

Japanese encephalitis is a vaccine-preventable disease; the affected individual above had not been vaccinated. The advice to ensure that everyone be vaccinated is prudent. The only measures to prevent infection are vaccination and avoidance of mosquito bites.
