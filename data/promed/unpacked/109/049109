Pernambuco is experiencing a measles outbreak, although the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) accredited the Brazilian territory as free of the disease in 2012. That year, there was only one confirmed case of measles in the state. In 2013, however, there were 689 notifications of suspected cases, of which 138 were officially confirmed, including the death of a 7 month old baby in the city of Moreno in the Recife Metropolitan Region (RMR). To date, there are still 230 cases under investigation; the rest were discarded.

To receive certification from PAHO, the then health minister Jose Gomes, submitted the application in 2010. The Federal Government was able to prove that vaccination coverage had reached 95 per cent of the population, in addition to proving that the last transmission of the disease within the Brazilian territory had occurred 10 years earlier, in 2000.

More than half of the cases are concentrated in RMR and areas of Mata, but there have also been reports from Caruaru (Agreste) and a suspected case from Ouricuri (Sertao) [Pernambuco]. According to public health nurse Rosilene Hans, director of State Disease Control, Recife, Cabo de Santo Agostinho, and Goiana are among the most affected municipalities [see map at http://www.slideshare.net/fullscreen/JCOnLine/mapa-sarampo-29859857/1].

The Federal Government has stated its position through the official statement that, "to ensure the interruption of transmission [of the virus], the Ministry of Health sent about 900 000 doses of MMR [measles, mumps, rubella vaccine] to Pernambuco between July and November 2013. Also in November 2013, the Ministry of Health assisted the State Secretariat of Health (SES) in implementing a vaccination campaign for children under 5 years of age in 16 priority municipalities in the state."

Health care authorities claim that the cases in Brazil have been "imported" from other countries, especially European countries such as France, where the disease has not been controlled. According to SES, cases of measles in the state increased after the Carnival [8-13 Feb 2013], when many tourists came to participate in traditional festivals. In the year of the [Association Football] World Cup [2014], the claim that tourists can "bring" measles becomes even more worrisome.

Rosilene Hans warns that "the cases that reappeared in April [2013] are of the measles virus genotype D8, very common in Europe, Asia, and Canada. The 1st cases diagnosed with the disease had had contact with individuals who traveled from these areas at risk."

Despite the justification for the resurgence of measles, a 20 year old housewife does not know how her son of 17 months may have contracted the disease. The child had a fever on a Sunday, which the family thought was a natural reaction to teething. However, on Monday, the boy had a rash, particularly on the face, coryza, conjunctivitis, and a cough. The boy's mother decided to take him to the nearest health unit where the pediatrician confirmed that the boy showed all the signs of measles. "My son had 2 doses of the vaccine (MMR) and had no contact with anyone sick. We did not travel or have contact with anyone who had traveled out of the country. I do not know how he got (measles)," says the mother. The case is not yet listed as confirmed in municipal or state records, but as a preventive measure, the city Health Department has vaccinated all persons who have had contact with the child, including the child's family and all the residents of the street where the family resides.

According to Pernambuco infectious disease and tropical medicine specialist Vera Magalhaes, "In fact, there have been some cases of measles [in Pernambuco] and in other states as well for some time, but only now is it being recognized because the disease was considered eradicated." The doctor also affirms that the supposed extinction of the disease in Brazil may have made the population careless in relation to measles. "I believe, yes, that the absence of registered cases may have made people think they were fully protected and, therefore, no longer vaccinated. So, when the disease comes back, it comes with everything," comments Magalhaes.

According to the doctor, about 30 years ago, measles was a very serious problem and a major cause of death among children under one year of age. "The return of this disease takes us back 30 years in our evolution. The warning is important because in case of complications, the victim may become blind and even die," adds the expert. Nurse Hans also states that the symptoms of measles can be mistaken, even for dengue.

Measles infections have risen dramatically, with outbreaks erupting as the highly infectious virus is imported from abroad.

An almost forgotten scourge in some countries, measles has made an astounding comeback in such unexpected parts of the world as Britain, the European continent, and Israel, and it is in these regions where American travelers are contracting it.

Worse, more than 98 per cent of Americans who've become infected were unvaccinated, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], which recently voiced concern about the measles upsurge. "This isn't the failure of a vaccine," said CDC director Dr Thomas Frieden. "This is the failure to vaccinate."

There were nearly 3 times as many measles cases nationally in 2013 compared with each of the past 13 years. Measles was declared eliminated in this country and the rest of the Western Hemisphere in 2000, Frieden said. But elimination doesn't equate with total eradication, he said. When pockets of the population remain unimmunized, the virus can spread remarkably fast, he added.

Since 2000, there were generally about 60 measles cases a year nationwide. In 2013, there were that many in Brooklyn, NY, alone. Nationally, there were 175 cases. North Carolina and Texas, like Brooklyn, have also experienced major outbreaks.

The Brooklyn outbreak struck 2 Jewish communities where parents shun vaccines for religious reasons. A 17 year old who had traveled to London contracted the virus and spread it upon return. Two measles cases were diagnosed in Nassau County, NY, in 2013. Mary Ellen Laurain, spokeswoman for the Nassau County health department, said neither of the Nassau cases was linked to the Brooklyn outbreak. And like other measles cases nationally, she said, they were imported. Dr Paul Lee, a specialist in infectious diseases at Winthrop-University Hospital in Mineola, NY, said one of the Nassau cases was treated in the summer at his facility. He described the patient as an adolescent who traveled to Turkey. "In the United States, we tend to think of measles as no big deal," Lee said of an infection with serious side effects. "But when you ask most people when they last saw a case of measles, they can't tell you."

Measles cases have risen exponentially over the past decade in global regions once lauded for high rates of vaccine compliance. In Europe, according to the World Health Organization, there were more than 20 000 cases in 2013. Dr Pascal Imperato, dean of the School of Public Health at SUNY Downstate Medical Center in Brooklyn, said the measles comeback abroad can be traced to misplaced fears about vaccines and autism. "There was a controversial report that linked measles and other immunizations to the development of autism," Imperato said of a paper published in the medical journal, The Lancet, 15 years ago. "That in turn gave rise to noncompliance on the part of many parents."

The Lancet retracted the report, and the doctor who wrote it was rebuked by British medical authorities. That physician has since moved to the United States.

Between November 2012 and October [2013], 12 096 cases of measles were reported by the 30 European Union/European Economic Area countries, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control said on Tuesday [7 Jan 2014]. The ECDC released a surveillance report on Tuesday covering the 12-month period up to the end of October [2013]. The report found that despite measles and rubella being targeted for elimination in Europe by 2015, a number of countries in Europe continue to experience large measles and rubella outbreaks.

The countries reporting the most measles cases were Italy, which experienced 28 per cent of Europe's reported cases, the United Kingdom, with 19 per cent of the cases, and the Netherlands, with 18 per cent of Europe's measles cases. Germany and Romania each experienced 14 per cent of Europe's reported measles cases. Those 5 countries alone accounted for 93 per cent of all cases in Europe.

The Netherlands experienced the highest notification rate for measles, with 130 cases for each one million people. Eleven countries surveyed reported a measles notification rate of less than one case per million individuals, which is the target rate for measles elimination. The measles vaccination status was known for 9882 cases out of the 12 096 reported cases. Of these cases, 87 per cent were unvaccinated, 9 per cent received one dose of measles vaccine, 0.5 per cent received 2 or more doses, and 4 per cent received an unknown number of disease [sic; presumably "vaccines"].

There were 3 measles-related deaths reported during the period, and 8 cases were complicated by acute measles encephalitis.

During the 12-month period, 39 122 cases of rubella were reported, with Poland accounting for 99 per cent of the cases. The report found that 88 per cent of the rubella patients were either unvaccinated or had an unknown status of vaccination.

Two people, including a baby, had measles symptoms so severe they were sent to hospital over the weekend, health authorities say. The new cases bring the number of confirmed measles cases connected to a hip-hop event in December [2013] to 16 -- one in Auckland, 2 in Wellington, and 13 in the Taupo-Turangi area.

In Taupo-Turangi, a 15 month old baby was admitted to hospital on Friday [10 Jan 2014] but has since been discharged. An adult was also sent to hospital and is still undergoing care. Medical officer of health Phil Shoemack said both patients were admitted because of the severity of their symptoms. "They were both sufficiently unwell that the best place for them was hospital," he said.

Health authorities were confident the outbreak had been somewhat contained, as all of those who were unwell had either been at the World Supremacy Battlegrounds event in Sydney or were in direct contact with someone who was, Shoemack said. "It's not a community outbreak in that regard," he said.

About one in 1000 people who get measles in New Zealand die, and, as with any outbreak, there is a risk of complications. Anyone born before 1969 is considered likely to be immune to the infectious disease, as are those who have had the MMR -- measles, mumps and rubella -- vaccine, introduced in 1990. Those vaccinated in the 1970s and 80s may be at risk, as there is uncertainty over the effectiveness of the shots they received, depending on the age at which they received them and the way the vaccine was stored.

Anyone found to have been in contact with an infected person, or who is unsure of their vaccination status, is given a blood test to check for antibodies. Anyone found not to have immunity is asked to stay in isolation for 10 days to see whether symptoms develop. Anyone who thinks they have measles symptoms -- such as a fever, sore and watery "pink" eyes, and small white spots inside the cheeks of the mouth -- should call their GP or Healthline on 0800 611 116.
