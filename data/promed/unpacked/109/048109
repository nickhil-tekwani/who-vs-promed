[The information below comes from the media report, with the elimination of political overtones and interpretations as our primary concern at ProMED-mail is to communicate technical information. - Mod.MPP]

Confirmed polio case in Delta Amacuro
The Regional Health Directorate of the Delta Amacuro area detected 2 more children with the symptoms of the disease, of which 1 had the incomplete vaccination scheme.

A new epidemic is beginning to resurface in the country due to the [lower] vaccination coverages in the population. The Venezuelan Society of Public Health and National Epidemiology Network Defenders reported that at least 4 cases were diagnosed with acute paralysis (poliomyelitis) in La Playita del Volcan, a community in the Delta Amacuro state. [note that only 3 cases are described in this article. -Mod.MPP] The affected individuals belong to the indigenous ethnic Warao group.

The virus that causes this condition [polio] resurfaced 3 weeks ago. According to the information that was provided unofficially, the 1st case corresponding to a 5-year-old boy with no history of having received polio vaccine, who during the month of April [2018] presented with a flu-like picture. "He was evaluated for inability to walk, and lower back pain without a history of trauma; previously he had been admitted to an emergency department with the impression of lumbar trauma, hip arthritis, and was evaluated by a pediatrician during 3 days, who identified that the child was unable to sit up and had flaccid [paralysis] of both lower extremities, and the diagnosis was changed to acute flaccid paralysis, having ruled out [the diagnosis of] Guillain-Barre syndrome, "according to the communication from the organizations".

They specified that the Regional Epidemiology Department of the Ministry of Health was notified of the case and the specimens were sent for diagnosis. The patient was treated with immunoglobulin and steroids. The specimens were processed by the Rafael Rangel National Hygiene Institute and confirmed that the child was infected with a type 3 polio virus [no mention if virus is WPV3 or a cVDPV3 - see Moderator comment below. - Mod.MPP]. It was known that the patient is clinically stable and is receiving physiotherapy.

When the Regional Epidemiology team went to Playita del Volcan, it identified 2 more children with acute flaccid paralysis in a house near where the child under 5 years of age who was diagnosed with [polio] lives. The specialists of the medical organizations indicated that it was known that one of the other [identified suspected] cases had a history of having an incomplete vaccination scheme, while the other was taken to another community in the state.

The cases of poliomyelitis begin to resurface in Delta Amacuro, [a state that was suffering from a measles epidemic] which has claimed the lives of more than 100 patients, mostly children. This state also reported suspected and confirmed cases of diphtheria a disease that returned to the country in 2016, 24 years after it had been eliminated [in the country].

The country [Venezuela] has not reported cases of polio since 1989.

The community where the cases were detected have registered low immunization coverages through the National Expanded Program of Immunizations [EPI] of the Ministry of Health. "It is very likely that the affected population and the entire state of Delta Amacuro also has low vaccination coverages," the doctors of the organizations highlighted in their statement, which also emphasized that the population of the community has not received any polio vaccine. since January 2016. For that year [2016], the national vaccination coverage with polio vaccine reached only 67 percent, well below the universal coverage of 95 percent recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). [there is mention that estimates based on the less than 1-year-old vaccination coverages, between 2008 and 2017, the number of children now susceptible to poliomyelitis is 2 600 000.

[While the media report mentions a poliovirus type 3 has been isolated from the 5-year-old boy, there is no mention as to whether the virus is a wild poliovirus (WPV) or a circulating vaccine derived poliovirus (cVDPV), or a vaccine derived poliovirus (VDPV). The last officially documented polio case due to WPV3 infection in Asia had a date of onset 18 Apr 2012 in Pakistan and in Africa had a date of onset on 10 Nov 2012 in Nigeria (see Kew OM, Cochi SL, Jafari HS, et al. Possible Eradication of Wild Poliovirus Type 3 - Worldwide, 2012. MMWR, November 14, 2014 / 63(45);1031-1033 available at: https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6345a4.htm#Fig1). The most recent environmental samples positive for WPV3 were on 7 Oct 2010 in Pakistan and 11 Nov 2012 in Nigeria. Since November 2012, no WPV3 has been isolated anywhere in the world.

With respect to WPV3 circulation in the Americas, the most recent isolation of WPV3 in the Americas was in 1993 and involved isolation from asymptomatic individuals (21 (47 percent) of 45 individuals tested) in Alberta Canada belonging to a religious group that did not accept vaccinations, with ties to a similar religious group in the Netherlands experiencing an ongoing outbreak of polio at that time. (see CDC. Isolation of Wild Poliovirus Type 3 Among Members of a Religious Community Objecting to Vaccination -- Alberta, Canada, 1993. MMWR May 07, 1993 / 42(17);337-339. available at https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00020490.htm.) Prior to 1993, there was WPV3 identified in Mexico in 1990, and in South America (Brazil) in 1988. (see Kew OM et al referenced above).

Given the apparent interruption of WPV3 transmission, with no isolations of the virus from either individuals or environmental samples since 2012, one hopes that this current poliovirus type 3 isolated in Venezuela is a vaccine derived poliovirus, and not a reappearance of a WPV3 having circuated undetected for the past 5.5 years. We await further information on the genetic typing of the poliovirus type 3 isolated.

The Warao are an indigenious ethnic group found in the northeast of Venezuela, Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana and Suriname. The total estimated population of this group in 20100 was 36 000. The name Warao means "the boat people". The majority of the Warao population live in the Venezuelan Orinoco Delta region. They live in wall-less thatched-roof huts built on stilts (to protect against floods), and sleep on hammocks. Canoes are their main form of transportation. They use 2 types of canoes. Bongos, which can carry up to 5 people, or another smaller one that seats 3 people and is used to find food sources on a daily basis. The Bongo is made from a large tree that is identified by the male leaders of each household, the tree is identified and killed at the beginning of the dry season. It is cut down and hollowed out and flattened with stone tools or local shell tools and fire. While they live in relatively inaccessible regions, HIV was introduced into the community, where male to male sex is practiced prior to marriage. In some communities the prevalence of HIV has reached 33 percent (see https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/07/world/americas/aids-venezuela-indigenous-people-threatened.html). (Information on the Warao community can be found at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warao_people#Dwellings).

[The newly confirmed case in Pakistan was reported in a media report in late May 2018 (see Poliomyelitis update (15): Pakistan (BA) RFI 20180529.5825949 from 29 May 2018). The media coverage of polio cases in Pakistan is a sign of the heightened awareness of the country on polio in general and in Pakistan in specific. The identification of a WPV1 in Kunar province Afghanistan is a bit of concern, as cases have not been reported from that province recently.

One thought that came to mind while reviewing the weekly report was the situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The most recent reported case of polio associated with the cVDPV was reported in late March/Early April 2018, approximately one month preceding the identification of ebolavirus disease (EBV) in Equateur Province. One can't help but wonder what impact the ongoing EBV outbreak is having on the surveillance activities associated with the cVDPV2 outbreaks in Haut Lomami, Haut Katanga and Tanganyika provinces.

A map showing the locations of WPV1 and cVDPV(2) cases can be found at http://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/.
