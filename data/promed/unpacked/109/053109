The New York City Health Department is testing the water at Manhattan Plaza, 400 West 43rd Street, after 2 building residents were diagnosed with legionnaires' disease. According to Department of Health commissioner [Dr. Oxiris] Barbot, "The New York City Health Department is working with building management to test the water in your building because 2 tenants have been reported sick with legionnaires' disease within the past 12 months."

People can contract legionnaires' disease by breathing in water vapor or aspirating water that has been contaminated with _Legionella_ bacteria.

Legionnaires disease is caused by _Legionella_ bacteria, which thrive in warm water. When not properly maintained and treated, cooling towers, whirlpool spas, and decorative fountains can become contaminated with _Legionella_. The mist that these man-made water systems release into the air can then carry the bacteria into people's lungs, where they cause infection and disease. People over 50 or those with weakened immune systems or chronic lung problems are more susceptible to developing legionnaires' disease, a severe type of pneumonia.

[Manhattan Plaza is a large residential complex with a health club that's comprised of 2 45-story residential towers. It is located west of Manhattan's Times Square neighborhood, between 9th and 10th Avenue and 42nd and 43rd Street. Opened in 1977, the complex has 1689 units and about 3500 tenants, of which 70% are from the performing arts, 15% are neighborhood residents, and 15% are elderly (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_Plaza). A map showing the location of Manhattan Plaza can be found at https://www.google.com/search?q=manhattan+plaza&npsic.

The above news article fails to characterize the 2 residents of Manhattan Plaza who developed legionnaires' disease [LD] as to their risk factors, possible sources common to both affected individuals (e.g., use of the health club where a hot tub might be located), identity of the _Legionella_ species involved, or if genotyping of isolated strains has been done.

Genotyping the clinical isolates from cases of LD will help to establish whether this is a common source outbreak, if the genotypes match. Matching the genotypes of clinical and environmental isolates of _Legionella_ will identify the environmental source for the individual cases. However, if the diagnoses were confirmed through urine antigen testing, there will be no clinical isolates for genotyping.

More information on this outbreak would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.ML
