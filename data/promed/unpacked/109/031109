Dozens of people in Kansas are getting sick from raw milk. At least
87 people became ill in 2 separate outbreaks of campylobacteriosis.
Kansas allows raw milk to be sold within the state, but health
officials want you to be aware of the health risks that come with
consuming raw milk.

Campylobacteriosis is an intestinal infection caused by the bacterium
_Campylobacter_. Infection often causes diarrhea, fever, abdominal
pain, nausea, headache, and muscle pain.

In the 1st outbreak in southwest Kansas, 68 people became ill after
eating cheese made from raw (unpasteurized) milk donated by a local
dairy for a community celebration; 19 people were ill enough to seek
medical attention, and 2 people were hospitalized. Of these persons 4
tested positive for _Campylobacter jejuni_; no other food items
served at the event were associated with illness.

The 2nd outbreak is linked to a dairy in south central Kansas that
sells raw milk directly to consumers. As of 30 Nov 2007, 19 cases of
campylobacteriosis had been reported. Each person reported drinking
raw milk purchased from the dairy.

Although most people with campylobacteriosis recover within 7 to 10
days, rare complications such as reactive arthritis, hemolytic uremic
syndrome, and Guillian-Barre syndrome can develop.

Pasteurization is the only effective method for eliminating
disease-causing bacteria in raw milk and milk products. It is a
simple process that involves heating the milk to a high temperature
for a short period of time.

[The following is extracted from the 8 Nov ProMED-mail posting of a
CDC (US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) reported outbreak
related to unpasteurized dairy products with the references renumbered:

Raw milk is a well-documented source of infections from _Salmonella_,
_E. coli_ O157:H7, _Campylobacter_, _Listeria_, _Mycobacterium
bovis_, and other pathogens (1-5). In 1938, before widespread
adoption of milk pasteurization in the USA, an estimated 25 percent
of all foodborne and waterborne outbreaks of disease were associated
with milk (6). By 2001, the percentage of such outbreaks associated
with milk was estimated at less than one percent (6). During
1998-2005, a total of 45 outbreaks of foodborne illness were reported
to CDC in which unpasteurized milk (or cheese suspected to have been
made from unpasteurized milk) was implicated. These outbreaks
accounted for 1007 illnesses, 104 hospitalizations, and 2 deaths
(CDC, unpublished data, 2007). Because not all cases of foodborne
illness are recognized and reported, the actual number of illnesses
associated with unpasteurized milk likely is greater.

Consumers have reported consuming raw milk for convenience, taste
preference, or perceived health benefits. Although some advocates
claim health benefits from raw milk compared with pasteurized milk,
including decreased risks for atherosclerosis, arthritis, and lactose
intolerance, such claims are not supported by scientific evidence
(7). Unsubstantiated claims of health benefits of raw milk for
infants and children are particularly concerning for care givers,
because infants and children are dependent on their care givers to
make safe dietary decisions for them. 16 of the 29 ill persons in
this outbreak were aged less than 7 years.

Pathogens that infect humans are shed in the feces of cows, can be
present in or on the udders of cows, and can contaminate their milk.
Standard hygiene practices during milking can reduce but not
eliminate the risk for milk contamination. In a 2001-2002 survey of
Pennsylvania dairy farms, pathogenic bacteria, including
_Salmonella_, were isolated from 13 percent of samples from raw milk
bulk tanks (8). Pasteurization decreases the number of pathogenic
organisms, prevents transmission of pathogens, and has been
determined to improve the safety of milk more than other measures,
including certification of raw milk (3,4).

As of 2004, at least 27 states permitted some form of raw milk sales
to the public, including sales at dairies, farmers' markets, or
through purchase of "cow shares." Certain states also allow public
sales of raw milk but for pet food only (9).

Given the continued interest in raw milk production, policy makers,
parents, and the public need to be informed regarding the potential
health risks posed by raw-milk consumption. The only sure way for
consumers to prevent raw milk-associated infection from _Salmonella_
or other pathogens is to refrain from consuming raw milk.
