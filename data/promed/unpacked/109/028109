Filler in animal feed is open secret in China
---------------------------------------------
As American food safety regulators head to China to investigate how a
chemical made from coal found its way into pet food that killed dogs
and cats in the United States, workers in this heavily polluted
northern city [Zhangqiu] openly admit that the substance is routinely
added to animal feed as a fake protein.
For years, producers of animal feed all over China have secretly
supplemented their feed with the substance, called melamine, a cheap
additive that looks like protein in tests, even though it does not
provide any nutritional benefits, according to melamine scrap traders
and agricultural workers [in Zhangqiu].
"Many companies buy melamine scrap to make animal feed, such as fish
feed," said Ji Denghui, general manager of the Fujian Sanming Dinghui
Chemical Company, which sells melamine. "I don't know if there's a
regulation on it. Probably not. No law or regulation says 'don't do
it'' so everyone's doing it. The laws in China are like that, aren't
they? If there's no accident, there won't be any regulation."
Melamine is at the center of a recall of 60 million packages of pet
food, after the chemical was found in wheat gluten linked this month
[April 2007] to the deaths of at least 16 pets and the illness of
possibly thousands of pets in the United States.
No one knows exactly how melamine (which is not believed to be
particularly toxic) became so fatal in pet food, but its presence in
any form of American food is illegal.
The pet food case is also putting China's agricultural exports under
greater scrutiny because the country has had a terrible food safety record.
In recent years, for instance, China's food safety scandals have
involved everything from fake baby milk formulas and soy sauce made
from human hair to instances where cuttlefish were soaked in
calligraphy ink to improve their color and eels were fed
contraceptive pills to make them grow long and slim.
For their part, Chinese officials dispute any suggestion that
melamine from the country could have killed pets. But regulators here
on Friday [27 Apr 2007] banned the use of melamine in vegetable
proteins made for export or for use in domestic food supplies.
Yet, what is clear from visiting this region of northeast China is
that for years melamine has been quietly mixed into Chinese animal
feed and then sold to unsuspecting farmers as protein-rich pig,
poultry and fish feed.
Many animal feed operators [in Zhangqiu] advertise on the Internet,
seeking to purchase melamine scrap. The Xuzhou Anying Biologic
Technology Development Company, one of the companies that American
regulators named as having shipped melamine-tainted wheat gluten to
the United States, had posted such a notice on the Internet last March [2007].
At the Shandong Mingshui Great Chemical Group factory, huge boiler
vats are turning coal into melamine, which is then used to create
plastics and fertilizer.
But the leftover melamine scrap, golf ball-size chunks of white rock,
is sometimes being sold to local agricultural entrepreneurs, who say
they mix a powdered form of the scrap into animal feed to deceive
those who raise animals into thinking they are buying feed that is
high in protein.
"It just saves money if you add melamine scrap," said the manager of
an animal feed factory [in Zhangqiu].
Last Friday [27 Apr 2007] in Zhangqiu, a fast-growing industrial city
southeast of Beijing, 2 animal feed producers explained in great
detail how they purchase low-grade wheat, corn, soybean, or other
proteins and then mix in small portions of nitrogen-rich melamine
scrap, whose chemical properties help the feed register an inflated
protein level.
Melamine is the new scam of choice, they say, because urea -- another
nitrogen-rich chemical -- is illegal for use in pig and poultry feed
and can be easily detected in China as well as in the United States.
"People use melamine scrap to boost nitrogen levels for the tests,"
said the manager of the animal feed factory. "If you add it in small
quantities, it won't hurt the animals."
The manager, who works at a small animal feed operation [in the area]
that consists of a handful of storage and mixing areas, said he has
mixed melamine scrap into animal feed for years.
He said he was not currently using melamine. But he then pulled out a
plastic bag containing what he said was melamine powder and said he
could dye it any color to match the right feedstock.
He said that melamine used in pet food would probably not be harmful.
"Pets are not like pigs or chickens," he said casually, explaining
that they can afford to eat less protein. "They don't need to grow fast."
The resulting melamine-tainted feed would be weak in protein, he
acknowledged, which means the feed is less nutritious.
But, by using the melamine additive, the feed seller makes a heftier
profit because melamine scrap is much cheaper than soy, wheat, or corn protein.
"It's true you can make a lot more profit by putting melamine in,"
said another animal feed seller in Zhangqiu. "Melamine will cost you
about USD 1.20 for each protein count per ton whereas real protein
costs you about USD 6.00, so you can see the difference."
Feed producers who use melamine [in the area] say the tainted feed is
often shipped to feed mills in the Yangtze River Delta, near
Shanghai, or down to Guangdong Province, near Hong Kong. They also
said they knew that some melamine-laced feed had been exported to
other parts of Asia, including South Korea, North Korea, Indonesia,
and Thailand.
Evidence is mounting that Chinese protein exports have been tainted
with melamine and that its use in agricultural regions like this one
is widespread. But the government has issued no recall of any food or
feed product here in China.
Indeed, few people outside the agriculture business know about the
use of melamine scrap. The Chinese news media -- which is strictly
censored -- has not reported much about the country's ties to the pet
food recall in the United States. And few in agriculture [in
Zhangqiu] do not see any harm in using melamine in small doses; they
simply see it as cheating a little on protein, not harming animals or pets.
As for the sale of melamine scrap, it is increasingly popular as a
fake ingredient in feed, [local] traders and workers say.
At the Hebei Haixing Insect Net Factory in nearby Hebei Province,
which makes animal feed, a manager named Guo Qingyin said: "In the
past melamine scrap was free, but the price has been going up in the
past few years. Consumption of melamine scrap is probably bigger than
that of urea in the animal feed industry now."
And so melamine producers like the ones in Zhangqiu are busy.
A man named Jing, who works in the sales department at the Shandong
Mingshui Great Chemical Group factory also in Zhangqiu, said on
Friday [27 Apr 2007] that prices have been rising, but he said that
he had no idea how the company's melamine scrap is used.
"We have an auction for melamine scrap every 3 months," he said. "I
haven't heard of it being added to animal feed. It's not for animal feed."

[Melamine is known to be toxic to many animals and potentially to
human beings and it is known to cause kidney failure.
Consistently throughout this article there is talk of small doses.
Yet dose does make the poison and some species are more sensitive, to
even small doses. Further, 'small doses' here is not defined. What
may be a small amount to a market size swine is above the lethal dose
for a beagle dog.
According to the United States Food and Drug Administrations (FDA)
regulations melamine is considered an adulteration. Adulterated foods
are not acceptable for marketing or consumption. The fact that the
Chinese company did not disclose the melamine in the gluten product
makes it an adulterated product and is subject to regulatory restrictions.
Our companion animals live much longer than many market animals.
However, melamine -- and possibly its metabolites -- are known to
pass into the urine, raising possibilities that it may pass into
edible tissues in market bound animals, such as swine, chicken, and
cattle. Consequently, low levels of melamine in tissues may show up
later in people as being a trigger for a number of diseases,
including cancer. - Mod.TG
This report highlights the need for enhanced internationally
coordinated control upon traded animal feed.
The following international agencies are engaged in said control:
1. The Codex Alimentarius Commission (CAC), responsible for the
development and maintenance of the Codex Alimentarius (Latin for
"food code" or "food book"), a collection of internationally
recognized standards, codes of practice, guidelines, and other
recommendations related to foods, food production, and food safety
under the aegis of consumer protection. The CAC was established (in
1963) by FAO (Food and Agriculture Organisation) and WHO (World
Health Organisation)
<http://www.codexalimentarius.net/web/index_en.jsp>
2. The FAO (United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization), which
includes a Food and Nutrition Division. Since January 2006, it has
become part of the Agriculture, Biosecurity, Nutrition, and Consumer
Protection Department, facilitating pursuance of a food chain approach
<http://www.fao.org/ag/ca/>
3. The WHO (World Health Organization), which includes a Department
of Food Safety, Zoonoses, and Foodborne Diseases
<http://www.who.int/foodsafety/en/>
4. The World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) has, since 2001,
broadened its scope of activities to include also food safety issues
to reduce foodborne risks to human health due to hazards arising from
animals. In this context, a hazard is defined as a biological,
chemical, or physical agent in food with the potential to cause an
adverse health effect in humans, whether or not it causes disease in
animals. A permanent Working Group on Animal Production Food Safety
(WGAPFS), to coordinate the food safety activities of the OIE, was
established in 2002. The Working Group includes in its membership
experts from the FAO, WHO, CAC, and Codex Committees engaged with
food of animal origin. Its objective is to improve the "production to
consumption" food safety continuum worldwide
<http://www.oie.int/eng/secu_sanitaire/en_introduction.htm>
The report of the last (6th) meeting of WGAPFS, held in November
2006, is available at
<http://oie.int/eng/secu_sanitaire/EN_report_APFSWG_november%202006.pdf>.
The WGAPFS established an ad hoc Group on animal feeding, which
drafted the Guidelines for the Control of Hazards of Animal Health
and Public Health Importance in Animal Feed.
During its 6th meeting, WGAPFS discussed these guidelines and
recommended that the ad hoc group include chemical hazards within its scope.
The current event in China, and its international ramifications,
illuminates the justification of such an inclusion. - Mod.AS
