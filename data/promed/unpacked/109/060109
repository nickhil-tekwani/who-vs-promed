The Union government's yellow fever [YF] vaccination centre, which was supposed to come up in (Pune) city 2 years back, is yet to take off as authorities have now decided to shift the venue of the centre to Aundh Civil Hospital instead of B J Medical College.

The change of location is due to the technical issues related to the procurement of medical equipment. "Earlier, we had decided to set up the centre at B J Medical College attached to Sassoon Hospital, which is under the Maharashtra government's Directorate of Medical Education and Research (DMER). There were some technical issues in terms of procurement of medical paraphernalia. We have now decided to set up the centre at Aundh Civil Hospital which comes under the Maharashtra government's Directorate of Public Health Department," said Vasant Gokak, senior regional director (regional office) of the Union ministry of health and family welfare.

"If everything goes as per our plans, the centre will become functional within a month," he said, adding that the Union government has also proposed to set up 2 more centres in Aurangabad and Nagpur.

Gokak said that the aim is to cater to the large number of people travelling to [YF] endemic countries in Africa and South America. Currently, they have to go to Mumbai to get the shot and obtain the mandatory yellow fever vaccination certificate, in the absence of which, they do not get permission to travel.

Yellow fever is an acute viral haemorrhaegic disease transmitted by infected mosquitoes. 'Yellow' refers to jaundice that affects some patients. There is no cure for yellow fever; treatment is symptomatic and is aimed at reducing the symptoms. "There will be a one-room facility at the government health centre. It will be manned by a medical officer and a nurse. It will offer vaccination only on fixed days and during fixed hours for those travelling to yellow-fever endemic countries," said a state health official.

Certain countries in South Africa and South America require travelers to get the yellow fever vaccination certificate. Also, people coming to India from these countries need a certificate stating that he or she is vaccinated otherwise they are quarantined at the airport hospitals and kept under observation for 10 days.

A yellow fever vaccination certificate is valid only if it conforms to the model certificate. The validity period of the international certificate is 10 years, beginning 10 days after vaccination. [WHO recently extended the validity to lifetime, but there is no guarantee that all immigration authorities have heard the news yet. - Mod.JW]

Foreign nationals residing in or who have passed through the yellow fever endemic countries during the preceding 6 days, are granted visas only after producing the vaccination certificate. After checking the vaccination certificate an entry read as 'Valid Yellow fever Vaccination Certificate Checked' is made in the passport of the passenger.

[Yellow fever (YF) vaccination in India over the past 12 months has been fraught with difficulties. The vaccine was in short supply and fake YF vaccination cards were being sold illegally. Apparently, the vaccine shortage is over.

The report above emphasizes the requirement for vaccination status to be recorded on official cards. Easy availability of vaccination centers to the traveling public will be essential to insure that individuals traveling to YF endemic countries are, in fact, vaccinated.

The arrival of an individual returning home to India from a YF endemic country viremic with YF virus could initiate an ongoing urban outbreak that could quickly become a very serious public health problem in India and beyond, since the vector mosquito is present in most of India and Southeast Asia, where YF virus is absent currently. One hopes that the arrival of the vaccine and its free administration has made vaccination possible and ended the illegal sale of fake YF vaccination cards as well. As soon as all travelers in India bound for YF countries receive the vaccine, the risk of introduction of YF virus by them will be eliminated.

Even so, India needs to have a contingency plan that can be swiftly initiated should a YF case appear in its national territory.
