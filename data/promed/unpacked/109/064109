Risk assessment on bone-in beef.
In the latest (No 18, January 1998) issue of the MAFF BSE Enforcement
Bulletin, under the heading "Publication of risk assessment on dorsal root
ganglia" it is stated that, "a copy of the risk assessment report is
available from the internet at <http://www.dnv.com>" (dnv turns out to be
an organisation named Det Norske Veritas). On the Web site quoted, the
following appears on the home page. [Sections from the BSE report appear
in quotes.
"DNV carried out a series of studies for the UK Environment Agency to
assess the risk of BSE (mad cow disease) infectivity through environmental
pathways. DNV were subsequently requested by the Ministry of Agriculture,
Fisheries and Food to undertake a new study quantifying the risks to people
from the consumption of beef products (January 15, 1998)."
There is then a link to a further web page which gives a summary and
conclusion of the risk assessment, but in the absence of any account of the
procedure and calculations by which the conclusion was reached, it can
hardly be described as 'the risk assessment report'. It reads "DNV has
carried out a study to assess the risk from tissues attached to the spinal
column that could be infected with BSE for the Ministry of Agriculture,
Fisheries and Food (MAFF) and the UK Government's advisory committee on BSE
issues, the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee (SEAC). DNV
concluded that the risk to people eating beef was extremely low, about one
new case of variant CJD in a billion years per person. However the risk
estimate has a wide range of uncertainty."
DNVs risk estimates were accepted by SEAC and used in their advice to
Government. Nevertheless, the Minister of Agriculture, Jack Cunningham,
decided that it would not be acceptable to allow tissues shown to transmit
BSE to remain within the human food chain. As a result he took action to
ban the sale of beef on the bone. So no more T - bone steaks or Ribs of
Beef when you are in the United Kingdom.
It is worth noting that in all the public references, by MAFF and by the
media, to the very low assessed risk, the phrase "However the risk estimate
has a wide range of uncertainty." has not been mentioned. It is, of course,
obvious to scientists, but not to lay persons.
Even having regard to the "wide range of uncertainty", however, it is
difficult to regard the Government's ban decision as science-based. This is
the same Government that sensibly wrote, in its White Paper (issued 14
January) on the proposed Food Safety Agency, "complete freedom from risk
is an unattainable goal, and safety and wholesomeness are related to the
level of risk that society regards as reasonable in the context of, and in
comparison with other risks in everyday life." And [the Government was,
in practice, simultaneously ignoring that statement.
SEAC did _not_ recommend the ban. It merely said that the Government could
inform the public of the SEAC report and the risk assessment and leave it
to individuals to exercise informed choice; but, SEAC added, _if_ the
Government wanted to take a further step, there were two alternatives, one
of which the Government chose to do. It seems to have been a decision of a
Government which, in view of the problems encountered by and criticism
heaped on, its predecessor, _dare not_ be seen to fail to take positive
action in relation to even the slightest risk. But it was a case of "damned
if they do, damned if they don't".
Actually, a survey reported today (Telegraph) shown a slight majority
supporting the ban, but it has led to the situation where a significant
part of the public regard the ban as absurd, many butchers are defying it,
the environmental health officers (the people responsible for enforcing it)
say it is unenforceable, and the Minister is threatening butchers breaking
the ban with prosecution and up to six months imprisonment and a hefty fine
or both.
Of course, journalists and butchers are not experts in risk assessment; and
the same would apply to nearly all of those who voted one way or the other
in the opinion survey. However these people are relying on what they have
heard or read about a risk assessment carried out by those supposedly
competent to do so. People in general do in fact make what amounts to some
sort of risk assessment every time they go out of their house, cross a
road, drive in a car, board a plane, stay at home, etc.

[As Ralph comments, the key lies in the phrase "wide range of uncertainty".
I fear that in 10-15 years time we will be inundated with a flood, a
tsunami of academic retrospective risk-analysis doctoral dissertations on
what should have been known, done, and calculated, the public's,
politicians', and researchers' separate appreciations of risk, and whether
the doom-sayers were vindicated or chicken-littles. It will be interesting
to see how many and which of the RAs of the '90s will stand up to analysis.
