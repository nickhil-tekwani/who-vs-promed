The Florida Department Agriculture and Consumer Services (DACS) reports 2 Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) cases in horses in Hillsborough County. The 2 geldings, a 3-year-old and a 9-year-old, showed onset of signs on 28 Aug 2022 and 2 Sep 2022, respectively.

Both vaccinated horses exhibited incoordination, hindlimb paresis, inability to stand and head pressing. Both have died. [The question is when were they vaccinated. The immunity for EEE in the horse seems to wane in approximately 3-4 months. So vaccination a year or even 6 months ago would likely have waned to the point there was no defense against this disease. - Mod.TG] These are the 10th and 11th confirmed case of EEE for Florida in 2022.

Eastern equine encephalitis is spread to horses and humans by infected mosquitoes, including several _Culex species_ and _Culiseta melanura_.

In horses, the virus causes inflammation or swelling of the brain and spinal cord. General signs include central nervous system signs such as head pressing, convulsions, lack of response to facial stimulation, fever above 103 deg F, ataxia, paralysis, anorexia, depression and stupor. Other signs may include irregular gait, teeth grinding, in-coordination, circling, and staggering. All signs may not be exhibited by an infected horse.

Today [15 Sep 2022], State Veterinarian Nora Wineland, DVM, released the following statement due to the discovery of Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) in a 14-year-old Percheron mare from Roscommon County. This is the 1st case of EEE in Roscommon County this year [2022].

"On 2 Sep 2022 the mare became ill with colic-like signs, which progressed to neurologic signs -- including muscle tremors, dog sitting, and being down with an inability to rise. The horse was unvaccinated against EEE and was humanely euthanized due to the severity of her condition.

"This case shows the virus is present in the area's mosquitoes and highlights the need to take precautions. Protect animals against mosquitoes by placing livestock in a barn under fans during peak mosquito activity (from dusk to dawn), eliminating standing water on one's property, using an insect repellant on animals which is approved for the species, and contacting a veterinarian to vaccinate horses against EEE and other mosquito-borne diseases.

"Also, please contact a veterinarian if a horse shows signs of the illness: mild fever and stumbling, which can progress to being down and struggling to stand."

EEE is a zoonotic, viral disease transmitted through the bites of mosquitoes to both animals and people; it is typically seen in late summer to early fall each year in Michigan. The disease is not spread by horse-to-horse or horse-to-human contact. Overall, EEE and other mosquito-borne illnesses will continue to pose a risk to both animals and humans until temperatures consistently fall below freezing.

EEE is one of the most dangerous mosquito-borne diseases in the United States with a 90% fatality rate among horses becoming ill and a 33% fatality rate among humans who become ill. For 2022, the mare is Michigan's 2nd case of EEE in a domestic animal, and there are no reported cases of EEE in humans.

Mosquito season is here! Unvaccinated horses, donkeys, mules, and other equids are at risk of this disease. It can be deadly. EEE immunity wanes fairly quickly in the horse. Consequently, revaccination is necessary approximately every 3-4 months. Even if you have vaccinated your equine friend, it may be time to do it again to keep the animal fully protected from this disease.

Please check with your veterinarian regarding when your horse was last vaccinated, or if in doubt, please vaccinate. EEE is preventable with safe, proven vaccines. - Mod.TG]
