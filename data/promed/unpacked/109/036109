A listeriosis outbreak is causing widespread panic and leaving death in its wake, but the National Institute for Communicable Diseases [NICD] is yet to determine the source of the food-borne listeriosis outbreak that has reached 748 laboratory-confirmed cases.

On Friday [12 Jan 2018], the institute said 67 people had been confirmed dead from the outbreak gripping the country, which surfaced early last month [December 2017] and affects all 9 provinces.

This week, Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi gave a situational update on the outbreak, revealing that since the last briefing held in December [2017], cases rose from 527 in December [2017] to 748 by Friday [12 Jan 2018].

Dr Juno Thomas, head of the Centre for Enteric Diseases at the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD), said this figure was "of great concern."

"It means that the source of the outbreak is not controlled, in other words, that the contaminated food items are still being distributed and consumed by people countrywide," she told City Press on Friday [12 Jan 2018].

At this stage, Thomas explained, it wasn't possible to predict the course of the outbreak.

However, based on global experience with listeriosis outbreaks, she said that such an outbreak may suddenly stop when the contaminated food items are no longer available. This would eliminate the bacteria from the food production environment, otherwise, the contamination would continue until investigations provided clues as to the likely source.

Thomas and her team at the NICD have identified the ST6 strain of the disease as the main [one] for the current outbreak, out of 8 other sequence types. According to Motsoaledi, this confirmed the current working hypothesis of a single source of food contamination causing the outbreak.

Explaining the strain's particular impact on humans, Thomas said: "In persons who develop meningitis (infection of the brain) due to _Listeria monocytogenes_, the ST6 in particular causes more severe disease than the other sequence types."

But the disease's main victims have been babies. Infants less than 28 days old account for close to 40 percent of cases so far in the country. Infants are especially vulnerable from birth to 6 days after birth.

Due to the rapid spread and the unusual behaviour of the disease, it has now been classified as a priority, which requires medical professionals to immediately report it to the department. Prior to this outbreak, medical staff treated about 80 cases annually that were not severe.

Last month [December 2017], environmental health practitioners from the City of Tshwane investigated a Tshwane patient hospitalised with listeriosis and collected a chicken sample from the fridge at the patient's home. It tested positive for _Listeria monocytogenes_. The sample was traced back to the store and back to the Sovereign Foods' abattoir from which it was sourced. As a precaution, the abattoir was served with a prohibition notice pending further investigations.

However, following whole-genome sequencing on the abattoir-related samples (a DNA-fingerprinting analysis to see whether particular organisms are related and were of the same sequence type), experts didn't pick up the outbreak strain (ST6). "At this juncture, we cannot conclude that the abattoir called Sovereign Foods is the source of the present outbreak," Mostoaledi explained.

The department said it was also an arduous process tracking the patients with confirmed cases of the disease. Currently, of the 748 lab-confirmed cases, the outbreak team has only traced the outcomes of 160 patients. According to the department, tracking the patients from the health facility that had the specimen was not easy because some did not have traceable physical addresses.

Mostoaledi said food premises within Gauteng -- with the highest number of cases at 442 -- would be inspected, targeting the food processing areas such as abattoirs and food retail shops.

The Director-General of the National Department of Health has formally requested food industry stakeholders to submit details of _Listeria_-positive food items, environmental swabs, and _Listeria_ isolates to the NICD.

[When last reported by ProMED-mail (Listeriosis - South Africa: fatal, increasing incidence, ST6 Archive Number: 20180108.5545556), there were a total of 720 laboratory-confirmed listeriosis cases, including 61 deaths. Now there are 748 nationally, including 67 deaths.

Previous ProMED-mail posts said that molecular typing identified ST6 in over 90 percent of clinical isolates from all 9 provinces, which supports the current working hypothesis of a single source of food contamination causing the outbreak, i.e. a single widely consumed food product, or multiple food products produced at a single facility.

However, the genotype of _Listeria monocytogenes_ isolated at a suspected abattoir in Tshwane did not match to the genotype of the outbreak strain. No ST6 food/environmental isolates have been identified to date, and the source of this outbreak remains unknown.

The City of Tshwane Metropolitan Municipality is the metropolitan municipality that forms the local government of northern Gauteng Province, South Africa; the Metropolitan area is centered on the city of Pretoria with surrounding towns and localities included into the local government area (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Tshwane_Metropolitan_Municipality). Gauteng Province, with a population of about 14 million residents in 2017, contains the country's largest city, Johannesburg, as well as Pretoria (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauteng).
