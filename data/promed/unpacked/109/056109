South Africa: More measles cases reported in Limpopo outbreak
-------------------------------------------------------------
In a follow-up to the measles outbreak reported in the Greater Sekhukhune District in Limpopo province, South Africa health officials report an additional 4 measles cases detected, increasing the total number of measles cases to 7 as of 21 Oct 2022.

The ages of the measles-infected cases ranged from 9 months to 24 years, with 3 cases being male and 4 being female. One child was fully vaccinated for measles, with 2 measles doses given in 2019. One child with measles had not been vaccinated, and the other 5 measles cases had unknown vaccination history. One measles case was admitted to the hospital while one other had a complication that led to pneumonia.

Greater Sekhukhune District and Limpopo Province Department of Health officials, with the support of other stakeholders including the National Institute for Communicable Diseases, have started with public health response activities. These activities include enhanced surveillance for measles, contact tracing, screening for suspected measles cases using the measles case surveillance case definition followed by collection of blood and throat swabs for measles diagnostic testing, and medical record reviews in healthcare facilities to identify missed cases. Persons who have been exposed to suspected or confirmed cases are being vaccinated to prevent the spread of measles.

The measles immunization coverage data for the Greater Sekhukhune district showed a decrease of 87% to 64% for measles dose 1 and 86% to 60% for measles dose 2 from 2017 to 2022. This is below the 95% coverage needed to achieve herd immunity.

Community awareness and health promotion by healthcare workers is continuing in the district to inform the public about the spread of measles and interventions to prevent disease. Measles vaccination has been initiated for children under 15 years to increase the measles immunity in the community and to prevent further spread of measles.

[2] GAVI: low income countries

Lower-income countries push to reach more than 85 million children with measles vaccine
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Following the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on critical routine health activities and secondary impacts on malnutrition leading to alarming rise in measles cases and outbreaks globally, the Vaccine Alliance (Gavi) is working with governments, communities and other partners in a concerted effort to roll out measles vaccines to vulnerable children across Lower Income Countries.

From 2022 through the first half of 2023, Gavi plans to support 22 lower-income countries to undertake measles follow-up campaigns aiming to reach more than 85 million children. These countries represent applications approved to date, with Alliance partners continuing to work with other priority and at-risk countries. In parallel, Gavi has stepped up support for outbreak response, dedicating an additional USD 10 million and supporting 9 countries with response activities so far this year [2022].

"Measles vaccination not only prevents outbreaks and deaths, but it also serves as an entry point for routine immunisation. Given the high rates of coverage needed, these campaigns can help identify un- and under-immunized children, bringing them more consistently into the health system," said Thabani Maphosa, Managing Director of Country Programs at Gavi. "This is critical for the sustainability of the measles response, reducing outbreaks in the long-term, and can also help save lives from other vaccine-preventable diseases."

Thanks to the widespread introduction of measles vaccine, global measles deaths have fallen dramatically -- in 2000, more than a million children died from measles, by 2020 this number was at a little over 60 000 deaths. Even with that impressive decline, however, progress has stalled in recent years. The pandemic further impacted this: recent data from the 57 lower-income countries supported by Gavi shows that coverage of a 1st dose of measles vaccine (MCV1) fell by a total of 4% during the pandemic. The pandemic also impacted countries' abilities to undertake surveillance and report cases, making more outbreaks inevitable.

But now lower-income country governments, with support from Gavi and partners, are pushing back. Between January and October 2022, follow-up campaigns were launched in Burundi, Guinea, Madagascar, Syria (Damascus) and recently Gambia. In Zimbabwe, a planned campaign was fast-tracked in response to an outbreak in September [2022]. In total, urgent efforts across multiple countries will aim to reach millions of children through the 1st half of 2023.

Alongside introductions, catch-up and follow-up campaigns, Gavi is supporting governments with dedicated outbreak response activities, helping 9 countries combat outbreaks so far this year [2022]. Working through the Measles and Rubella Initiative's (M&RI) Outbreak Response Fund (ORF), Gavi is the main funder of measles outbreak response activities in lower-income countries -- providing a total of USD 85 million to cover the more than 60 country applications for outbreak response support the ORF has received since 2013. M&RI is a partnership of American Red Cross, U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, UNICEF (United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund), United Nations Foundation, and World Health Organization.

In its current strategic period (2021-2025), with a mission to 'leave no one behind with immunization', Gavi is also deepening its investments in health and immunization systems strengthening. In particular, the Alliance is focused on providing targeted support to reach "zero-dose children" and missed communities through routine programs, dedicating USD 500 million through a special Equity Accelerator Fund (EAF) to be accessed by Gavi eligible countries to 'identify' and reach the zero dose children through innovative approaches and partnerships to overcome systemic challenges. Up to USD100 million of this has been set aside for the Zero-Dose Immunization Program (ZIP), a collaboration between Gavi and non-government organizations with humanitarian expertise, with the aim to reach zero-dose children amongst refugees and displaced populations across fragile and conflict-affected countries in the Sahel and Horn of Africa.

A unique challenge and opportunity
----------------------------------
One of the top vaccine-preventable killers of children, measles is both highly contagious and requires close to 95% vaccine coverage through routine vaccination and highly effective supplemental campaigns to stop it from spreading. This presents a significant challenge to countries, particularly for low-income countries, where the vast majority of measles deaths occur. These more vulnerable health systems need to consistently and effectively reach large parts of their population, including "zero-dose children" who are systemically left behind. With the rising birth cohort in Africa, countries need to reach more children every year just to maintain coverage. Following the pandemic, countries are also dealing with several other competing health priorities, making planning and implementing effective campaigns extremely challenging.

At the same time, measles vaccination represents an important opportunity to improve the overall strength of a health system. If a zero-dose child can be identified through a measles campaign, this is a critical entry point for both routine immunization and other essential services. This can help save more lives and build trust while also increasing countries' abilities to detect and respond to outbreaks.
