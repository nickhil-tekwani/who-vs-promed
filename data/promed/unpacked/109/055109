Glanders in the United Arab Emirates in post-import isolation premises
-------------------------------------------------
(Disease never reported before in the United Arab Emirates).
Emergency report
Information received 11 Oct 2004 from Dr Khalfan Abdulaziz Alsuwaidi,
Director General of Animal Wealth Department, Ministry of Agriculture and
Fisheries, Dubai:
Date of the report: 25 Sep 2004(1).
Nature of diagnosis: clinical, post-mortem and laboratory.
Date of initial detection of animal health incident: 10 Apr 2004 (the
difficulty in accurately confirming the cause of the initial cases has
delayed reporting).
Estimated date of primary infection: unknown (the initial cases were seen
in animals that had been imported on 8 Apr 2004 and whose previous history
is not known to the Animal Wealth Department, Dubai).
Outbreaks:
Location: Emirate of Dubai, town of Al Ain
No. of outbreaks 1
Description of affected population: the initial cases were seen in 3 out of
10 imported horses whilst they were under restriction undergoing routine
post-import checks(2). In addition, the disease was detected on 29 Jun 2004
in local horses sharing the same post-import isolation premises.
Total number of animals in the outbreak:
species: equ
susceptible: 69*
cases: 7**
deaths: 0***
destroyed: 6
slaughtered: 0
* No. of susceptible animals on two post-import premises. Cases have so far
been identified on only one of these premises.
** Including 3 imported horses and 4 local horses sharing post-import
isolation premises.
*** One of the imported horses died suddenly when air conditioning failed
-- death is therefore believed to have been due to heatstroke rather than
glanders.
Diagnosis:
A. Laboratories where diagnosis was made:
- Central Veterinary Research Laboratory, Dubai;
- Institute fur Mikrobiologie der Bundeswehr, Munich, Germany.
B. Diagnostic tests used:
- complement fixation test;
- bacterial culture;
- biochemical tests;
- PCR(3) - _Burkholderia mallei_ DNA sequencing.
C. Causal agent: _Burkholderia mallei_).
Epidemiology:
A. Source of agent / origin of infection: horses imported by road from a
Middle-Eastern country.
B. Other epidemiological details: the disease has been contained within the
post-import isolation premises and has not entered the United Arab Emirates
equine population.
Control measures:
- Routine post-import restrictions remain in place.
- Trace back/forward of horses entering and leaving the infected premises.
No horses have left since the entry of the imported horses.
- All other recent imports from the same country have been traced and
checked and no disease has been found.
- The remaining horses in the affected post-import isolation premises will
be subjected to further testing (all have now undergone 2 complement
fixation tests, with negative results, since the last cases were removed).
- Further expert advice is being sought concerning the testing and release
of the remaining horses, e.g. possible use of mallein test.
(1) Note by the OIE Animal Health Information Department: the delay between
the date of the report and the date the information was received at the OIE
Headquarters was due to an error in electronic communication.
(2) All horses entering the United Arab Emirates are subject to post-import
restrictions pending checks and official release by Ministry Veterinary
Officers. If local horses are present on the import premises, they also
remain under restriction until the imported horses are released.
(3) PCR: polymerase chain reaction

[This is the only report of glanders to OIE anywhere in world for the
past 18 months (although ProMED-mail has carried other reports, as
referenced below). Other countries reporting the disease recently include
Turkey in 1998, Latvia in 1996, India in 1988, Ethiopia and Eritrea in
2002, and Belarus in 1999. The disease has been on the decline since the
early 20th century, with the last report in Zimbabwe in 1911, Kenya in
1916, Canada in 1938, United States in 1942, Sweden in 1943, and Japan in
1935.
Glanders, formerly referred to as farcy, is a disease largely of horses,
donkeys, and mules caused by the bacterium _Burkholderia mallei_ (formerly
_Pseudomonas mallei_). However, it is a zoonotic pathogen and can cause a
painful death in humans. Moreover, it has properties that make it a
potential bioweapon, and in fact has a history of such use dating back to
World War 1.
Symptoms of glanders in humans include nodular eruption on the face, legs,
and arms; involvement of the nasal mucosa; and later pyemia and metastatic
pneumonia. Human glanders may be confused with a variety of other diseases,
including typhoid fever, tuberculosis, syphilis, erysipelas, lymphangitis,
pyemia, yaws, and melioidosis. For more information, see the 2004
Brazilian reference listed below. - Mod PC]
