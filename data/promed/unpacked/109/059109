On 17 Mar 2006, WHO received reports of a possible outbreak of
botulism in northern Thailand (Nan Province) among guests at a
festival who had eaten home-preserved bamboo shoots. Although
antitoxin for the treatment of botulism is only available in some
countries, WHO was able to ensure delivery of antitoxin to Thailand
by the morning of 19 Mar 2006.
As of 20 Mar 2006, the Ministry of Public Health (MOPH) established
that 152 of the 170 people attending a local village Buddhist
festival in Banluang District, Nan Province, had developed symptoms
suggestive of botulism (dysphagia, dysarthria, ptosis, abdominal
discomfort, muscle weakness). All of the affected people had eaten
pickled bamboo shoots prepared in a traditional manner, with symptoms
developing and progressing over 24-48 hours following
consumption. 100 of the 152 people were hospitalized, and 40 have
since required intubation and respirator support. To date, no deaths
have been reported.
The local health office has traced and recalled the suspect cans of
locally produced bamboo shoots and is providing public education on
food safety. WHO is working closely with the MOPH, local technical
partners and the CDC on laboratory investigation in support of case
diagnosis, investigation, and foodborne disease investigation and
surveillance. A case control and cohort study is under way to
describe the outbreak in detail.
To date, 60 doses of antitoxin (20 from UK, 30 from CDC and 10 from
Sanofi-Pasteur Canada) have been provided, and severely affected
patients are being treated. The Japanese National Institute of
Infectious Disease is planning to deliver another 23 doses of
antitoxin to Thailand today, 22 Mar 2006.

Patients who contracted botulism from contaminated processed bamboo
shoots were airlifted to hospitals in Bangkok today, 23 Mar 2006,
from Thailand's northern province of Nan.
A Thai Air Force C-130 cargo aircraft transported 17 patients --
including 12 women, 4 men and 1 girl -- to 7 hospitals in Bangkok
Thursday. Most are in critical condition. Dr. Prat Boonyawongvirot,
Deputy Permanent Secretary for Public Health, said the Department of
Medical Services covered all expenses to transport the patients.
It will take about 2 months for them to recover under medical
treatment if the hospitalized patients don't have complications, he added.
In Nan, there are 79 patients including 15 critically ill cases, in
hospitals. 9 patients still on respirators were admitted to hospitals
in other provinces nearby, said Dr. Prat.
Meanwhile, Public Health Minister Pinij Jarusombat said he had
ordered health officials in Nan and nearby provinces to inspect
tinned bamboo shoots in the market as the products of low quality can
be contaminated with _Clostridium botulinum_ spores.

[Botulinum toxins are the most potent toxins known to man. The exact
lethal dose is not known, but extrapolations can be made from primate
studies. Commonly cited estimated lethal doses for purified
crystalline botulinum toxin type A for a 70 kg man are: 0.09-0.15
microgram intravenously, 0.80-0.90 microgram by inhalation, and 70
microgram orally. Considerably lower figures, however, have been
generated by other studies and estimates from human cases. Because a
mouse bioassay is the standard for detection and quantification, the
toxin is usually expressed in terms of biological activity in terms
of mouse intraperitoneal lethal dose (LD) 50 (MIPLD50).
The 7 toxin types produced by _C. botulinum_ strains are
immunologically distinct but produce a clinically similar and highly
recognizable syndrome by similar pharmacological mechanisms. The
molecular site of action and some clinical features, however, differ.
All the toxins are translated as single polypeptide chains of similar
structure that are nicked by proteases. The protease nick yields a
light chain of approximately 50 kD containing a catalytic subunit (a
zinc-dependent metallo-endopeptidase) responsible for the toxic
effects and a heavy chain of about 100kD that binds the target
tissue. Both clostridial proteolytic enzymes and human digestive
enzymes such as trypsin can activate the toxin.
The toxins are released from _C. botulinum_ in association with 2
other proteins, a hemagglutinin and a nontoxin,
nonhemagglutinin. The complex of the toxin and its covalently bound
associated proteins is referred to as the progenitor toxin. These
associated proteins, however, neither play a role in the symptoms of
botulism nor are needed for binding or penetration.
All toxin types exert their action on the cholinergic system at the
presynapic motor-neuron terminal by blocking acetylcholine
transmission across the neuromuscular junction. Toxins types A and E
enzymatically cleave a specific presynaptic membrane-associated
protein; toxin types B, D, F and G cleave a synaptic
vesicle-associated protein. Type C toxin cleaves both the
membrane-associated protein targeted by types A and E and an
additional protein associated with exocytosis. The effect in all
cases is neuromuscular blockade resulting in flaccid paralysis. The
toxins also affect the adrenergic system but apparently with
insignificant consequences. - Mod.LL]
