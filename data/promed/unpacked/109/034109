Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) - Oman 15 Mar 2018
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
On [4 Mar 2018], the National IRH focal point of Oman reported 1 additional case of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).

The patient was a 74-year-old male Omani national, living in Batinah, who had symptom onset on [23 Feb 2018]. The patient had neither recently travelled nor had any contact with any person with respiratory symptoms or with a known MERS-CoV case. The patient took care of camels that were reportedly ill. The investigation of the patient's exposure in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms is still ongoing.

Prior to this patient, the last laboratory-confirmed case of MERS-CoV from Oman was reported in November 2017.

Globally, 2144 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV, including at least 750 related deaths, have been reported to WHO.

Details of the case:
Case no./ Date of notification to WHO / Reporting country / City of residence / Age / Sex / Health care worker / Comorbidities / Exposure to camels / Camel milk consumption / Exposure to MERS-CoV cases / Date of symptoms onset / Date of 1st hospitalization / Date of laboratory confirmation / Status / Date of outcome
1 / 4 Mar 2018 / Oman / Batinah / 74 / M / No / No / Yes / NA / No / 23 Feb 2018 / 23 Feb 2018 / 1 Mar 2018 / Alive

*Data subject to change due to ongoing investigations. Fields related to the final status of the case are updated as information is available.
NA = Not available

Public health response
Identification, tracing and follow up of family and health care workers contacts is ongoing, including MERS-CoV screening. All identified contacts will be monitored for 14 days from the last possible date of exposure.

[This is the 1st laboratory confirmed case of MERS-CoV infection reported by Oman in 2018, bringing the total number of laboratory confirmed cases reported by Oman to 11. During 2017, there were 2 cases reported by Oman. One on 5 Nov 2018 (see MERS-CoV (69): Oman, Saudi Arabia (RI, QS) RFI 20171105.5425993) and one reported to WHO on 30 Aug 2017, and reported by WHO on 12 Oct 2017 (see MERS-CoV (59): Oman, Saudi Arabia, WHO 20170913.5313874). In addition, there have been 2 cases reported in Omani citizens travelling to Thailand and confirmed by Thailand. A common observation in the cases reported by Oman is a history of contact with camels in the 14 days preceding onset of illness.

In total, there have been 2144 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV reported to WHO since September 2012, including at least 750 related deaths (reported case fatality rate 35.0 percent). (This total includes cases reported by Saudi Arabia up through 11 Jan 2018).

[2] Saudi Arabia, 2 new cases 6-13 Mar 2018
Date: 15 Mar 2018

As of today [15 Mar 2018], information on reported cases, fatalities and recoveries was available through [13 Mar 2018] at which time, according to the Saudi MOH MERS-CoV website (see URL above), there have been a total of:

1815 laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection including:
736 reported fatalities
1071 reported recoveries and
8 currently active cases

[in contrast, according to the spreadsheet that I have been maintaining, there have been a total of:
1810, laboratory confirmed cases including
733 reported fatalities (case fatality rate of 40.5 percent)
1060 reported recoveries and
16 currently active cases

I have tried to reconcile the counts but I have been unable to do so successfully other than to repeat my previous disclaimers "As previously mentioned, the numbers of deaths, recoveries, and currently active cases come from my spreadsheet tallies and differ from those listed on the Saudi MOH website; my spreadsheet counts asymptomatic infections as they are reported. One complication is the reporting of cases as either recoveries or deaths that cannot be confirmed as previously reported newly confirmed cases. Another complication is delayed reporting of cases." - Mod.MPP]

Information on newly confirmed cases (2 cases):
- both are Saudi males
- both are not healthcare workers
- both were noted to be in stable condition
