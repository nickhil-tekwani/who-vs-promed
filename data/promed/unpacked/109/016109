[The vehicles potentially implicated include undercooked meat and salad ingredients or, alternatively, the issue could be related to inadequate kitchen sanitation when food for serving is contaminated by the bacteria in the kitchen. ProMED awaits more information regarding this outbreak especially related to the source and scope of the cluster. - Mod.LL
