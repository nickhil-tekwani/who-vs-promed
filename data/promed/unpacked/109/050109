Mefloquine has been used with great success by the US Peace Corps as a
chemoprophylactic agent. In Africa the incidence of malaria dropped more
than 80% between 1990 and 1997 due to an intensive program utlizing
Mefloquine as the chemoprophylactic agent of choice. There were no cases
of cerebral malaria during this time.
Although I no longer have the data
(someone at the Peace Corps should have it), I do not believe the Peace
Corps experienced more than 2 or 3 severe psychiatric effects over the same
time period, estimate about 3000 volunteers per year using the drug. None
of the reported psychiatric events were confirmed by a qualified health
professional but were taken as a self report. The dose of Mefloquine was
250mg per week. Peace Corps did not use the drug for treatment purposes,
only prophylaxis.
The common wage-earner in Kenya cannot afford Mefloquine
and would not use it as a prophylactic agent regardless, but it seems
reasonable that this should be the recommended drug for expatriates &
travelers, with doxycycline as a second choice. It is important to realize
that perhaps as many as 30% of volunteers reported some side effect of
Mefloquine, but not so severe as to outweigh the risks of contracting
malaria.
It does not seem wise to literally "ban" the use of chloroquine, since data
exists indicating that it has significant efficacy though not as effective
as before. What is the status of some of the "newer" antimalarials and
their availablity, popularity and street price e.g. doxycycline,
artemether, halofantrine? If chloroquine is banned will it launch the
sales of some of these others which have higher adverse side effect
profiles?
