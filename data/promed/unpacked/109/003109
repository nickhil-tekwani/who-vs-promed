["Mammalian tuberculosis is a chronic bacterial disease of animals and humans caused by members of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC). Within the complex, important variants include _M. bovis_, _M. caprae_, and _M. tuberculosis_. The disease is global in distribution, with only a few countries considered free. It is a major infectious disease of cattle, other domesticated animals, and certain wildlife populations. Zoonotic tuberculosis resulting from transmission to humans constitutes a public health problem."

The surveillance program for bovine tuberculosis in Norway 2021, published by the Norwegian Veterinary Institute in 2022, is available at https://www.vetinst.no/overvaking/tuberkulose-storfe-kameldyr-oppdrettshjort.

This report mentioned that "apart from 2 single-herd outbreaks in Sogn og Fjordane County in 1984 and 1986, Norway has been considered free from bovine tuberculosis since 1963 (1). Since 1994, the EFTA (The European Free Trade Association) Surveillance Authority (ESA) has recognised Norway as officially free from bovine tuberculosis, as described in ESA Decision 225/96/COL replacing ESA Decision 67/94/COL. In 2000, a surveillance programme for bovine tuberculosis in cattle was launched. Today the programme includes investigation of suspicious material from cattle, llamas, alpacas, and farmed deer."

"In 2021, organ samples from 5 bovine, one red deer, and 2 alpacas suspected of bovine tuberculosis were submitted to the Norwegian Veterinary Institute for examination. Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (_M. bovis_, _M. caprae_, _M. tuberculosis_) was not detected in any of the samples." - Mod.CRD
