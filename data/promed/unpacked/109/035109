As if dealing with the possibility of contaminated water wasn't
enough, officials at Norway's National Hospital in Oslo were also
battling an outbreak of infection linked to the listeria bacteria; 2
patients are already dead. Personnel at both Rikshositalet and
Radiumhospitalet, which have merged, were scrambling to pinpoint the
source of listeria infections.

Yet another case of listeria infection was confirmed Friday morning
[19 Oct 2007] at the National Hospital (Rikshospitalet og
Radiumhospitalet), which is the country's foremost cancer hospital
and takes in patients from all over the country. Friday's case
bring[s] to 12 the number of listeria infections identified since 1
Oct 2007. Of the infected patients, 2 have since died, probably
because their immune systems were already weak because of their illnesses.

Hospital officials still haven't confirmed the source of the listeria
bacteria but suspect it stemmed from contaminated cold food.
Aftenposten.no reported later on Friday afternoon [19 Oct 2007] that
cheese had emerged as the main suspect.

The listeria bacteria is an especially dangerous one, leading to the
serious illness known as listeriosis, which has a mortality rate of
25 percent. The disease mostly affects pregnant women, newborns, and
adults with weakened immune systems.

Hospital officials have discarded all supplies of refrigerated food
from the kitchen that serves both Radium Hospital and Rikshospital.
Intense testing was being carried out and officials said they
couldn't rule out the possibility of new cases, since the bacteria's
incubation period can extend up to a month.

[Listeriosis is a worldwide zoonosis, caused by _Listeria
monocytogenes_ that is transmitted from the intestinal tract of farm
animals to humans by ingestion of contaminated food. Infection
results in diarrhea and in some patients, invasive disease that
includes bacteremia without an evident focus, meningitis, abscesses
in the brain and spinal cord, endocarditis, and intrauterine
infection. Infection during pregnancy can lead to premature delivery,
infection of the newborn, or stillbirth. Invasive listeriosis is rare
(about 2500 cases occur annually in the US), but the disease has an
overall mortality rate of 20 to 30 percent. Newborns, pregnant women,
people 60 years of age or older, and those with compromised immune
defenses (such as, HIV-infected patients) are most susceptible to
invasive disease.

The organism can be killed by pasteurization, but heavy contamination
can reduce pasteurization's effectiveness. Although cooking can kill
the organism, contaminated surfaces in food preparation areas can
recontaminate previously cooked food that requires no further cooking
prior to eating. The organism can then continue to grow in the
refrigerated, packaged ready-to-eat product, since _L. monocytogenes_
grows at refrigerator temperatures. Its presence in food does not
alter the taste or smell of the food.

Implicated food has included raw milk and pasteurized milk, soft
cheeses such as Latin-American cheeses, feta, brie, and Camembert,
ice cream, raw vegetables, delicatessen salads such as coleslaw, cold
cuts, turkey franks and other hot dogs, raw and smoked fish,
shellfish such as shrimp, and undercooked chicken. - Mod.ML
