A total of 3 cases of _Staphylococcus aureus_ blood infection [bacteremia] have been found in babies at [the neonatal unit] of Prince Royal Maternity Hospital in Glasgow [Scotland, UK]. Of the 3 cases, 2 babies were extremely ill due to their very early [premature] birth and have died, with the infection one of a number of contributing causes in both deaths. The 3rd premature baby who tested positive for _S. aureus_ required treatment for the bacterium and is in a stable condition. NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, which is responsible for the hospital, was alerted to the infections on 24 Jan [2019].

Dr. Barbara Weinhardt, infection control doctor, said: "Our thoughts are with the families affected. Results [have confirmed] that the 3 cases of _S. aureus_ are linked and our investigations continue into how they are linked. _Staphylococcus aureus_ is a bacterium that is found on the skin and in the nasal passage of around one in 4 people and only causes infection when it enters the body. In cases where people are vulnerable to infection, it can cause serious infection. We have taken a number of control measures in the unit, including a deep clean, isolation and barrier nursing, safety briefs to all staff and infection control advice to all visitors."

The investigation will be led by an incident management team (IMT), which is a group of medical professionals who look into the causes of investigations and ensure preventative measures are in place. Dr. Alan Mathers, Chief of Medicine, Women's and Children's Service, added: "The national guidance sets out that an investigation should be triggered when 2 or more cases of the same type of bacteria are found. In this case, this was triggered on 24 Jan [2019] and an IMT meeting was convened. The IMT began their investigations into possible linkages between the 3 cases and sent samples for testing.

"Whilst these results were awaited, we spoke to the families affected, together with the parents on the unit and staff, to let them know of our investigations. The results that have [come back have confirmed] links between the 3 cases. Our infection control team continues to work closely with clinical colleagues and domestic staff to manage the situation and take all necessary steps to maintain patient safety."

[_Staphylococcus aureus_ bacteremia is a life-threatening bloodstream infection. A nosocomial cluster of cases of _S. aureus_ bacteremia over a short period would suggest a common environmental source. However, we are not told over what period these 3 cases occurred, and although the 3 cases are said to be "linked," we are not told the nature of this linkage.

Surfaces in the hospital environment, such as bed curtains, furniture, and hospital equipment, contaminated by _S. aureus_ represent important reservoirs for these organisms. Indwelling vascular or endotracheal catheters can become contaminated. Contaminated intravenous or enteral solutions could also be a possible source for a nosocomial outbreak. Patients can become colonized or develop infections, such as bacteremia, pneumonia (especially ventilator-associated pneumonia), traumatic and surgical wound infections, bone and joint infections, prosthetic device infections, urinary tract infections, meningitis, and infective endocarditis. Premature and critically ill infants are especially susceptible to developing these infections. _S. aureus_ spread most commonly on the hands of hospital personnel from the contaminated environment or from other patients who are either infected or colonized with these organisms. A previous neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) _S. aureus_ outbreak reported by ProMED-mail (Staph. aureus (MSSA), NICU - Canada (ON) 20070309.0839) was attributed to overcrowding and inadequate infection control precautions.

The Princess Royal Maternity Hospital, located in Glasgow, Scotland, was built in 2001 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Royal_Maternity_Hospital). More information on this outbreak would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.ML
