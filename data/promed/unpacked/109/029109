The bacterial wilt disease detected in potato crops in the south of the country has set off the alarm among producers. It is currently limited to the regions of La Araucania and Los Rios. Since it spreads easily, producers fear it will reach the region of Los Lagos.

Luis Miquel, Chile Potato Consortium, said that people were concerned about this disease because it was different from other well-known diseases. The [spread] of the bacterial wilt involves water, so researchers should focus and increase their studies on this.

[Brown rot (also called bacterial wilt) of potato is caused by _Ralstonia solanacearum_ race 3 (biovar 2, adapted to cooler temperatures) or race 1 (prevalent in warmer areas). Yield losses are mostly caused by tuber rotting. In many warmer areas of the world, brown rot is one of the main limiting factors in potato production. The pathogens can also affect tomato and other solanaceous plants. Different races and biovars cause lethal wilting diseases on more than 200 known hosts including many important crops.

Brown rot symptoms on potato include internal staining and rotting of tubers, as well as wilting and death of plants. The disease may result in substantial yield losses. However, there may also be latent infections. The pathogens can survive in potato tubers during storage posing a high risk for introduction of the pathogen to new areas.

The bacteria are spread by mechanical means (including insects), contaminated equipment, infected plant material (including seed potatoes), soil and water. They can survive in soil on plant debris or roots of hosts. Some weeds and unharvested potato plants may serve as pathogen reservoirs. Disease management is difficult, relying mostly on exclusion from new areas. Some cultural methods (such as crop rotation) and limited genetic resistance may be used.
