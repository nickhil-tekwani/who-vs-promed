At least 30 ranches in southeast Alberta are under quarantine after the discovery of a single case of bovine tuberculosis [TB], leaving producers unable to sell their animals and fearful their income for the year may evaporate. "It's just plain bad," said Alberta Beef Producers chair Bob Lowe, who met with many of the affected producers in Brooks on Thu [27 Oct 2016] evening. "You go out there and talk to those guys, and it's absolutely devastating. And they can't get any answers -- they don't know where to turn."

In late September [2016], the United States Department of Agriculture notified the Canadian Food Inspection Agency [CFIA] that a case of bovine TB had been detected in a cow from Alberta when it was slaughtered in the United States. That cow was traced to a farm near Jenner, about 50 km [approx. 31 mi] northeast of Brooks.

Bovine TB is a reportable disease in Canada and has been subject to a mandatory national eradication program since 1923. While Canada is considered to be officially free of bovine TB today, isolated cases still occasionally occur. Alberta's last case was 2007, while British Columbia had one in 2011.

In response to the latest case, the CFIA has been making contact with all cattle producers in Newell County, Special Area No.2, Special Area No.3, Acadia No.34, and Cypress County to attempt to identify animals that may have been exposed, either at individual ranches or at the Buffalo-Atlee and Suffield Block community pastures. A total of 30 ranches have been quarantined, meaning animals cannot be moved without permission until bovine TB has been ruled out through further tests and investigations.

"The goal is to minimize disruptions to producers, while respecting Canada's domestic and international obligations to take appropriate and prudent control measures," the CFIA said in a statement. "These measures are critical for protecting the health of Canadian livestock and maintaining market access." The CFIA could not provide a time frame for how long the investigation will take, saying it will depend on whether additional animals test positive. It is also possible the quarantine order could be expanded to more farms.

The bovine TB case is not expected to affect border access for Canadian beef, and incidences of the disease generally pose no risk to public health. However, Lowe said for the affected ranchers, the quarantine comes at the absolute worst time. Fall is when producers take their calves to market, and in this particular area of Alberta, which is very dry, virtually no-one can afford to hold onto them for long. "Nobody out there winters calves," Lowe said. "They don't have the water and they don't have the feed, so they either send them out to be custom fed or they sell them. They can't do either of those things right now because of the quarantine, and it's hurting."

If the CFIA orders an animal slaughtered during the course of a disease outbreak investigation, the producer is eligible for financial compensation. However, there is no compensation available for losses that result from not being able to sell when intended, or from having to feed an animal longer than planned. "All of that stuff is on the producers' back," Lowe said. "I know the CFIA has its protocols, but it really needs to expedite the investigation process. Producers are suffering the consequences."

In an emailed statement, Alberta's agriculture minister Oneil Carlier said he is aware of the situation and monitoring it closely. "We understand the urgency of the situation and we continue to have ongoing communication with the federal government," Carlier said. "We are working with them regarding what programs may be available so we can determine the best course of action to meet the needs of producers in this situation."

Bovine TB is a contagious disease caused by a bacterium, _Mycobacterium bovis_. Animals usually acquire the disease by inhaling or ingesting the organism. While Bovine TB primarily affects ruminants like cattle, bison, elk, deer, goats, and sheep, it can affect all types of mammals, including humans. Bovine TB also affects a wide range of wildlife which, under certain circumstances, may transmit the disease to back to livestock.

[At one point, fingers were being pointed at the elk herds roaming in the area. But these animals had come from Elk Island National park, where the animals are closely monitored and tested free of brucellosis and tuberculosis, and retested before any are released for restocking elsewhere.

Hopefully USDA has a culture from this cow and can provide genomic strain identification as this may indicate where the infection came from. At this time it seems that this was a singular _M. bovis_ infected cow among the cows culled from that Jenner herd in September [2016]; presumably the others also went to slaughter and were inspected on the line, whether by USDA or by CFIA. Now to discover if any other animals in this Jenner herd or in neighbouring herds are infected.

To find Jenner, go to: http://www.fallingrain.com/world/CA/01/Jenner.html. It is in the south east corner of the province, east of Calgary. The above account has it 50 kms [approx. 31 mi] NE of Brooks, which is shown in this map: http://ftp.geogratis.gc.ca/pub/nrcan_rncan/raster/atlas_6_ed/reference/bilingual/alberta.pdf. - Mod.MHJ
