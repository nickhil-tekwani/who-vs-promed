News 5 has learned that the Baldwin County Health Department has confirmed
the 1st case of eastern equine encephalitis [EEE] [virus infection] in a
baby. The Health Department detected EEE [virus infection] in 2 sentinel
chickens in the Orange Beach area back in June [2008] and one sentinel
chicken in Gulf Shores.

Health officials say it's important to limit your exposure to mosquitoes to
avoid EEE [virus infection]. Environmentalist Rachel Beck recommends
keeping repellant on hand when you are outdoors.

Mosquitoborne viruses like EEE and West Nile virus [are transmitted] from
bird to mosquito to bird. When birds become scarce, sometimes mosquitoes
will take blood from mammals like humans and horses. That's how humans and
horses become ill. Although there are vaccines available for horses, there
is no vaccine for West Nile or EEE [viruses] available to humans.

[EEE virus is endemic along the USA Gulf of Mexico coast. The proposed
cycle of EEE virus transmission in this article is incorrect. It is very
unlikely that birds are scarce in Alabama. The US CDC's fact sheet
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvbid/arbor/eeefact.htm> says: "EEE virus is
transmitted to humans through the bite of an infected mosquito. It
generally takes from 3 to 10 days to develop symptoms of EEE after being
bitten by an infected mosquito. The main EEEV transmission cycle is between
birds and mosquitoes. Many species of mosquitoes can become infected with
EEEV. The most important mosquito species in maintaining the bird-mosquito
transmission cycle is _Culiseta melanura_, which reproduces in freshwater
hardwood swamps. _Culiseta melanura_, however, is not considered to be an
important vector of EEEV to horses or humans because it feeds almost
exclusively on birds. Transmission to horses or humans requires mosquito
species capable of creating a "bridge" between infected birds and
uninfected mammals, such as some _Aedes_, _Coquillettidia_, and _Culex_
species."

EEE virus infections in humans are serious, with an encephalitis case
fatality rate of about 33 per cent, and of the survivors, about half suffer
severe, permanent neurological damage. There is a commercially available
vaccine for horses but not for humans, so avoidance of mosquito bites is
the only way to prevent infection.
