The Ministry of Public Health [MOPH] is accelerating its efforts to create immunity from rabies according to the goal set with the World Health Organization for 2020.

MOPH Permanent Secretary Sopon Mekthon revealed that 80 percent of rabies mortalities came from being bitten or scratched by their own dogs or friend's dogs that were not vaccinated.

The Disease Control Department has therefore collaborated with the Livestock Department, Department of Local Administration and related agencies to encourage local administrations to prevent rabies infections in their communities in order to create rabies-free zones, according to the World Health Organization initiative for the year 2020.

Pet owners are advised to vaccinate their pets and report any sign of rabies to the authorities.

Samut Prakarn [Samut Prakan] province is launching a free pet rabies vaccination and sterilization program to stem the spread of the deadly virus and curb the population of stray dogs.

The Samut Prakarn Provincial Livestock Office has stepped up its anti-rabies campaign in response to a report of 3 deaths associated with rabies by the Disease Control Department.

Rabies infections have been confirmed in 20 provinces. Songkhla, Samut Prakarn, Kalasin and Chonburi provinces have the highest number of cases. Puppies aged between 3 and 6 months are the main carriers.

Local livestock offices are offering pet owners free rabies vaccines and sterilization. Veterinarians have advised those bitten or scratched by a dog or a cat to clean their wounds and see a doctor immediately.

Those spotting animals that appear sick, crazed or vicious must inform community leaders or livestock officials at once.

[Globally, estimates indicate that human mortality (due to endemic canine-mediated rabies) is highest in Asia, with the highest incidence and deaths reported in India. This is closely followed by Africa; however, estimates of burden have always been uncertain due to the absence of reliable data. http://www.who.int/rabies/epidemiology/en/

Based on 2007 data, after India and Viet Nam, Thailand has the 3rd highest number of rabies in Asia although more recent data shows the situation is improving. Dog bites are by far the biggest cause of rabies in Thailand. Between 2003 and 2012, there were a total of 166 confirmed human cases. Although the trend shows a decrease in number of confirmed cases reported, there are many cases that are not diagnosed and the estimates of rabies cases in Thailand as in many other countries are much higher. http://www.searo.who.int/thailand/news/wrd2013/en/

Rabies is a 100 percent vaccine-preventable disease. Countries embarking on rabies elimination programmes have successfully experienced marked reductions, often progressing to the elimination of rabies. Elimination programs often revolve around mass dog vaccination campaigns, where at least 70 percent of the dog population should be covered in order to break the cycle of transmission in dogs, and to humans. Safe, effective vaccines can also be used for pre-exposure immunization in people. Post-exposure prophylactic vaccinations are required for treating individuals who have had no previous immunisation. The reduced volume required by intradermal vaccines, in comparison to the intramuscular vaccine, results in cost savings of 60-80 percent. Intradermal vaccination may be a more cost-effective option for high-flow clinics where the disease is endemic. http://www.who.int/rabies/about/en/

[The described human cases in Samut Prakan province led the French website mesvaccins.net to publish, on 19 May 2016, the following advice for travelers: "In Thailand, the traveler must consider every bite, scratch or lick [of] a wound by any warm-blooded animal (dog, cat, monkey or other mammal) as a medical emergency and must seek a medical center immediately." https://www.mesvaccins.net/web/news/8923-rage-humaine-en-thailande-trois-deces-dans-la-province-de-samut-prakarn (in French, trans. Corr.SB)

The main issues related to rabies, globally, were reviewed during the recent WHO/OIE conference "Global elimination of dog-mediated human rabies", held in Geneva on 10-11 Dec 2015. The reports and the agreed recommendations can be read at http://www.oie.int/eng/RABIES2015/publication.html. These recommendations are scheduled to be discussed during the 3rd plenary session of the annual General Session of the OIE, Tuesday, 24 May 2016, afternoon. More than 800 participants representing the 180 OIE Member Countries and numerous international, intergovernmental, regional and national organisations are expected to participate in this 84th General Session of the World Organisation for Animal Health, in Paris.
