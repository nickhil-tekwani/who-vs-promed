Origin and diversity of novel avian influenza A H7N9 viruses causing human infection: phylogenetic, structural, and coalescent analyses.
Authors: Di Liu et al.
----------------------
Summary

Background
----------
On 30 Mar 2013, a novel avian influenza A H7N9 virus that infects human beings was identified. This virus had been detected in 6 provinces and municipal cities in China as of 18 Apr 2013. We correlated genomic sequences from avian influenza viruses with ecological information and did phylogenetic and coalescent analyses to extrapolate the potential origins of the virus and possible routes of reassortment events.

Methods
-------
We downloaded H7N9 virus genome sequences from the Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data (GISAID) database and public sequences used from the Influenza Virus Resource. We constructed phylogenetic trees and did 1000 bootstrap replicates for each tree. Two rounds of phylogenetic analyses were done. We used at least 100 closely related sequences for each gene to infer the overall topology, removed suspicious sequences from the trees, and focused on the closest clades to the novel H7N9 viruses. We compared our tree topologies with those from a bayesian evolutionary analysis by sampling trees (BEAST) analysis. We used the bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo method to jointly estimate phylogenies, divergence times, and other evolutionary parameters for all 8 gene fragments. We used sequence alignment and homology-modelling methods to study specific mutations regarding phenotypes, specifically addressing the human receptor binding properties.

Findings
--------
The novel avian influenza A H7N9 virus originated from multiple reassortment events. The HA gene might have originated from avian influenza viruses of duck origin, and the NA gene might have transferred from migratory birds infected with avian influenza viruses along the east Asian flyway. The 6 internal genes of this virus probably originated from 2 different groups of H9N2 avian influenza viruses, which were isolated from chickens. Detailed analyses also showed that ducks and chickens probably acted as the intermediate hosts leading to the emergence of this virulent H7N9 virus. Genotypic and potential phenotypic differences imply that the isolates causing this outbreak form 2 separate subclasses.

Interpretation
--------------
The novel avian influenza A H7N9 virus might have evolved from at least 4 origins. Diversity among isolates implies that the H7N9 virus has evolved into at least 2 different lineages. Unknown intermediate hosts involved might be implicated; extensive global surveillance is needed, and domestic-poultry-to-person transmission should be closely watched in the future.

The new H7N9 bird flu strain continues to spread across China. Currently, more than 120 cases have been reported across 10 provinces, and 24 deaths. Yet no one knows where the virus started, which hampers efforts to contain it. But a promising new antiviral drug may help tackle flu in the future.

In an attempt to find the source, Chinese labs have tested 68 000 samples since early March 2013. They have been taking swabs on farms and live animal markets, both from birds and the surfaces they've been in contact with. Only 46 of those samples, scattered across central and eastern China, carried the H7N9 virus: 44 from markets selling live poultry, one from urban racing pigeons and one from a wild pigeon. "Not one farm tested positive," says Juan Lubroth, chief veterinary officer of the UN Food and Agriculture Organization in Rome, Italy.

Genetic differences between the samples suggest the virus has been spreading in animals for a few months. But which animals? The carriers found to date were too far apart to sustain an epidemic. Lubroth's team has started looking for the virus in older samples from a wider range of organisms. "We're going back to our freezers and thawing samples," he says. City pigeons are also likely to come under closer scrutiny.

Hong Kong banned live poultry markets after H5N1 bird flu struck in 2004. Some Chinese cities have now shut theirs, but Lubroth fears that too hasty a response could drive the trade underground. Like H5N1, the new strain could spread to neighbouring countries, such as Viet Nam, that do not have China's ability to monitor and contain the spread of disease. Even if doctors spot cases of H7N9, there may be little they can do. Widespread use of the antiviral drug amantadine in Chinese poultry has already allowed many drug-resistant flu strains to emerge, including H7N9. So far, one H7N9 infection has resisted the common antiviral Tamiflu.

Better drugs are in the pipeline. Several pathogens, including flu and the bacteria that spark the multi-organ failure of sepsis, kill by triggering a runaway over-activation of the immune system. Eisai, a pharmaceutical company based in Tokyo, Japan, has a drug called Eritoran that blocks the response. A large clinical trial conducted in 2011 found that Eritoran is safe in people but doesn't treat sepsis. There is hope the drug might work in flu, however. This week, Stefanie Vogel at the University of Maryland Medical Center in Baltimore and colleagues found that Eritoran saved 90 per cent of mice from an otherwise lethal flu virus when it was given 2 days after infection. It also saved 1/3rd of the mice 6 days after infection. If the drug also works in people, it could prove invaluable in a future flu pandemic.

[3] 27th death
Date: 2 May 2013

A 55 year old man in central China has died from a new strain of bird flu, bringing to 27 the number of deaths from the mysterious H7N9 virus, state news agency Xinhua said on Thursday [2 May 2013]. The H7N9 virus, which has infected 127 people in China, is a threat to world health and should be taken seriously, scientists said on Wednesday [1 May 2013]. The Geneva-based World Health Organization (WHO) has described it as "one of the most lethal" flu viruses but said there is as yet no evidence of human-to-human transmission of this virus.

The latest victim, a native of southeastern Jiangxi province, died in Hunan province, Xinhua said. The man sold braised pork and was diagnosed with the H7N9 virus on 26 Apr 2013, the Hunan Health Bureau said on its website. A 69-year-old farmer, also from Hunan, was the latest person to be infected with the virus, state media said.

So far, 26 people have recovered after contracting the virus, according to Xinhua. Chinese scientists have confirmed for the 1st time that the H7N9 strain has been transmitted to humans from chickens.

Last week, a man in Taiwan became the 1st case of the flu outside mainland China. He caught the flu while traveling in China.
