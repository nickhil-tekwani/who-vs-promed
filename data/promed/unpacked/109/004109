A 31-year-old woman died of H5N1 avian flu in Giza Tuesday [27 Jan 2015], marking the 9th death in the country from the disease in 2015, the Health Ministry announced in a statement. The statement said that 2 new infections were detected on Tue [28 Jan 2015]; a 34-year-old woman and a 4-year-old, adding that that they are being hospitalized.

So far, the ministry reported 28 bird flu cases diagnosed this year [2015]. They include 10 cases, which have been treated, 9 undergoing treatment, and 9 deaths.

Most avian flu cases in Egypt have been detected in impoverished rural areas, where villagers are accustomed to raising poultry on the rooftops of their homes to supplement their diet, Ahmed Abdel Hamed, a former health ministry official [said]. The disease 1st appeared in Egypt in 2006. The death toll of bird flu in the country reached 10 in 2014.

[H5N1 is a highly pathogenic avian (bird) flu virus that has caused serious outbreaks in domestic poultry in parts of Asia and the Middle East. Highly pathogenic refers to the virus's ability to produce disease. Although H5N1 does not usually infect humans, nearly 650 human cases of H5N1 have been reported from 15 countries since 2003. About 60 percent of these people died from their illnesses (http://www.flu.gov/about_the_flu/h5n1/). China has only reported 9 H5N1 cases to the World Health Organization over the past 5 years, but Egypt appears to be experiencing a recent upsurge in cases.
