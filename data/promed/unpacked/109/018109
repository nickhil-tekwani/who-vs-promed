[Since the WHO Update No.9, which covered the period up to Sun 23 Mar 2003,
the number of cases of Ebola fever has increased by 12 from 123 (13
laboratory confirmed) to 135 (still only 13 laboratory confirmed) and the
number of deaths by 7, from 113 to 120. The number of contacts being
followed up, however, has declined from 79 to 34, which suggests that the
outbreak may be coming under control. - Mod.CP]
