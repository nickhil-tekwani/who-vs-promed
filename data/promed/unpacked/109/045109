Long Beach health officials warn fleaborne typhus cases are on the rise. The number of fleaborne typhus cases is up over last year [2011], and local health officials are warning residents to take precautions. So far this year, 11 cases of the illness have been reported to the Long Beach Health Department, compared with 9 for all of last year.

The fleaborne typhus -- known as murine typhus [also called endemic typhus] -- is a disease spread by fleas living on rats and mice, opossums, cats, and raccoons, health officials explained. People get the disease through the bites of infected fleas, adding that it isn't spread from person to person. The commonest symptoms of fleaborne typhus are high fevers, severe headaches, body aches, and a rash. The disease is rarely fatal, but people can become sick enough to be hospitalized, health officials said.

Prior to 2006, fleaborne typhus wasn't known to be present in Long Beach. For more information about fleaborne typhus, contact the Health Department's Epidemiology Program at 562-570-4302, check online at http://www.longbeach.gov/health.
