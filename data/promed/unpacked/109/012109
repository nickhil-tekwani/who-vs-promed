The UK regulator responsible for testing for bird flu defended its
methods today after scientific experts raised the possibility that
they may be flawed. The response from the Department for Environment,
Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) was in reaction to a report in New
Scientist magazine. The magazine quoted experts as questioning
whether the low rates of milder forms of the disease found in the
UK's wild birds indicated flawed testing methods. "The findings of
the Defra survey of wild birds are valid," a Defra spokesperson told
FoodProductionDaily.com today. "Simply because previous surveys have
revealed different results does not invalidate the present survey,
which should be regarded as the most up-to-date source of data on the
prevalence of avian influenza viruses in wild birds in the UK."
Since the beginning of the avian flu crisis in Europe, consumption of
poultry and eggs has fallen dramatically in some member states,
leading to a sharp reduction in prices. The questions raised over the
UK's testing methods could give the public further cause for concern.
Last week, UK scientists found the deadly H5N1 form of bird flu for
the first time in the country. A dead swan in Fife, Scotland tested
positive for the highly pathogenic form of the disease, which may be
transmitted to poultry flocks and to humans.
On 6 April Defra again stated that other tests on wild birds so far
were negative for flu, so the H5N1 virus was unlikely to be
widespread. The regulator stood by its policy that there was no need
to require that all UK poultry be kept indoors as a precaution
against the disease. "We are urgently considering whether there is a
need for any regional measures in addition to those that have already
been put in place in the protection and surveillance zones,"
according to a joint statement from the chief veterinary officers in
the UK and Scotland. "Further advice will be available once the full
veterinary assessment is complete and this situation will be reviewed
on a daily basis."
However New Scientist yesterday quoted Bjorn Olsen, who conducts
Europe's largest bird monitoring survey, as warning that regulators
may have missed many flu cases because of the way that samples are
handled. Other scientists from the US told New Scientist that "at
least 6 or 7 per cent should be positive" at any time. "We thought
there was an unusually low level but perhaps that happens in some
bird populations," Ruth Crommie of the WWT was quoted as stating in
the magazine. [See Avian influenza, poultry vs migratory birds (11),

The Defra spokesperson said the UK's Veterinary Laboratories Agency
(VLA) is using the most up-to-date testing technologies to detect
avian influenza viruses. "The VLA is world-renowned for its avian
influenza testing work," he said. "As an international reference
laboratory for avian influenza, the VLA even verifies other
countries' test results. It is internationally recognised as a centre
of excellence in veterinary research."

Swan identification
--------------
We also receive badly decomposed samples for post-mortem examination.
With swans, a relatively simple identification technique is to
examine the sternum and trachea (assuming they are still present).
In the mute swan, there is no tracheal loop passing through the
sternum, whereas a loop of some sort is enclosed in a bony
protuberance of the sternum in the trumpeter, tundra and whooper
swans. These may easily be seen through a single, mid-sagittal cut
down the sternum, using a bandsaw.
Wild bird surveys for AI virus
----------------
I am not a virologist and am not qualified to comment on the issue of
specimen handling, but the UK detection rate, while low, doesn't seem
out of line with at least one other European study reported in the
literature:
1: Avian Dis. 2003;47(3 Suppl):857-60. Influenza A virus surveillance
in wild birds in Northern Europe in 1999 and 2000. Fouchier RA, Olsen
B, Bestebroer TM, Herfst S, van der Kemp L, Rimmelzwaan GF, Osterhaus
AD. National Influenza Center and Department of Virology, Erasmus
University, Dr. Molewaterplein 50, 3015 GE Rotterdam, The Netherlands.
Using reverse transcription/polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), we
have screened more than 8500 wild birds in Northern Europe in 1999
and 2000 for the presence of influenza A virus. Although our primary
focus was on ducks, geese, and shorebirds, we have also tested
thousands of samples from other bird species. Approximately 1 percent
of our samples were positive for influenza A virus by RT-PCR, and
from half of these we were able to isolate influenza A virus in
embryonated chicken eggs. A wide variety of isolates was obtained
representing hemagglutinin (HA) subtypes 1 through 7, 10, 11, 13, an
unidentifiable HA, and neuraminidase (NA) subtypes 1 through 8. PMID:
14575077 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]

The European Food Safety Authority called for tougher monitoring of
wild birds, especially in Africa, to slow down the spread of bird
flu. "There is a need for enhanced and passive AI (avian influenza)
monitoring for wild birds, particularly in regions of high risk for
the EU considering the flyways of migratory birds, such as Africa,"
it said in a report. Blaming the spread of bird flu mainly on water
fowl and swans, the body said authorities lacked hard data about wild
birds' migrating patterns and recommended that a special monitoring
network be set up in Europe. While stressing the importance of
sampling, it also said that procedures should be harmonized across
the European Union, and that training and trapping skills should be
bolstered.
So far, bird flu has been detected in 13 EU member states and 3
countries have found the virus on farms.
