ADULT COLONIZATION BOTULISM - CZECH REP. EX GEORGIA (02): SUSPECTED

By way of follow-up to the earlier posting, I am informed by Dr Paul
Jarman, the consultant neurologist on the case, that toxin type A was
detected. He also confirms that the PCR detected the toxin gene rather than
the toxin itself. The mouse bioassay was negative. Dr Jarman mentions that
this was the 3rd botulism case he has treated in 2005.
Dr Jarman also offers as an additional take-home point that botulism
presents very much like myasthenia except for the tell-tale autonomic
involvement -- dilated pupils, dry mouth, constipation, etc. Also, the
presentation is more 'explosive' than most cases of myasthenia, usually
with rapid progression to respiratory failure days after symptom onset.
In answer to other questions received about this case, she had taken a
1-week course of "high\-dose" ciprofloxacin about 2-1/2 weeks prior to the
Georgia trip. She is not a vegetarian.

[The finding of the toxin A gene by PCR does not assure that the gene
itself was expressed. This is particularly of note in the presence of a
negative mouse bioassay. The case, however, as previous discussion earlier
in this thread, still likely represents adult colonization
botulism. ProMED thanks Dr. Laminack for his additional information. - Mod.LL]
