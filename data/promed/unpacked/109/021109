Mumps and measles alert
-----------------------
The Department of Public Health in Limerick [province of Munster] has
recently been notified of 18 cases of mumps across the Mid-West area,
with over half of these amongst students at the University of
Limerick (UL). GPs (general practitioners) in Limerick have been
alerted to the increased cases, which comes at a time when Ireland
has also been shown to have one of the worst records in Europe at
fighting measles.

Low uptake of the MMR [mumps, measles, and rubella] vaccination,
which currently stands at 77 per cent, makes Ireland one of 4
countries named and shamed in a World Health Organisation (WHO)
survey as having particularly low immunity to measles, mumps, and
rubella among adults and children.

In the University of Limerick, close contacts have been offered
immunisation through the Student Health Service and GPs across the
Mid-West have been put on the alert for symptoms. The HSE [Health
Service Executive] is advising students on the UL campus to ensure
that they are protected against mumps unless they are already immune.
Immunity to mumps will result from having either received 2 doses of
the MMR vaccine in the past; been immunised during the outbreak of
mumps that occurred at UL in March 2005, or already have had clinical
mumps. According to a spokesperson from the HSE, most of those born
since 1988 have had 2 doses of MMR vaccine.

"If people are definitely not immune nor certain, they should seek
medical advice through their GP or Student Health Centre as to
whether they need a dose of the MMR vaccine to protect them at this
time. University staff who think that they are not immune have been
advised to attend their own general practitioner for this vaccine,"
he advised.

Meanwhile, deputy Jan O'Sullivan, is calling for an urgent campaign
to encourage parents to immunise their children, to prevent a measles
epidemic.

[A vaccination coverage rate of 77 per cent is considered
unsatisfactory from a public health standpoint as the pool of
susceptibles remains at a level that will support continued
transmission of the measles virus, and the mumps virus as well.

ProMED-mail has had numerous postings mentioning the challenges faced
in several countries as a result of the anti-vaccine lobby that has
resulted in lower coverages with measles-containing vaccines. It is a
pity that the anti-vaccine lobby hasn't been reviewing the data and
literature to see the actual impact of measles seen in the
pre-vaccine era, with immediate complications (primary measles
pneumonia, encephalitis, severe diarrhea with dehydration, and death
related to these complications) and subacute to delayed
complications, such as sub-acute sclerosing panencephalitis. - Mod.MPP
