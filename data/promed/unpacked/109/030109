In view of the recent detection of WNV-infected mosquitoes -- the first
during the 2002 season -- in Israel, the following background information
might be of interest to your subscribers:
The first descriptions of West Nile fever (WNF) in Israel, a country
located on the migratory route of many bird species from Europe to Africa,
date back to the 1940s. Repeated outbreaks occurred in the central and
northern parts of the country during the 1950s; several restricted sporadic
episodes have been recorded during years to follow.
In the summer of 2000, acute cases of WNF were identified, mainly in the
central and northern parts of Israel, involving 452 people. The outbreak
peaked in September and declined in October, with 29 fatal cases, primarily
in the elderly. The disease was declared notifiable. During 2001, 44
clinical cases were recorded, of which 3 were fatal.
To deal with the outbreak, the relevant authorities, namely the Ministries
of the Environment, of Health, and of Agriculture (Veterinary services),
established a multi disciplinary interministerial committee and activated
regional field teams. Adult mosquitoes caught by the inspectors of the
Environment Ministry are forwarded to the Entomology Lab, Government
Central Laboratories, Ministry of Health in Jerusalem, where they are
differentiated according to species and gender. Batches of 20-50 specimens
are deep-frozen and consequently forwarded to the Central Virology
Laboratory, Public Health Services, Ministry of Health at Tel Hashomer,
where the presence of the virus is checked, including immediate screening
by TaqMan analysis of all specimens, followed by virus isolation,
sequencing, and phylogenetic analysis.
Up to now, 2 Culex species have been incriminated as WNV vectors in Israel,
namely _Culex pipiens complex_ and _Culex perexiguus_.
