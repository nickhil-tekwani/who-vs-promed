Almost 350 confirmed and 50 more possible _Salmonella_ infections have been recorded across Europe and in the United Kingdom linked to melons. Some patients live in the United States. Between mid-March and early July 2021, 348 people fell ill due to _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Braenderup and 68 needed hospital treatment but none have died. In addition, 4 people were sick in the USA and 2 in Canada.

In late June 2021, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) looked into 3 illnesses related genetically by whole genome sequencing but didn't find a link to those sick after eating melons in the UK. One ill person traveled outside the USA before they were sick, but not to Europe, and did not report eating melons. The other 2 sick people did not have food histories available and did not report traveling.

The UK is the most affected country, with 102 confirmed infections, while Sweden, Belgium and Germany all have 46. Denmark has 37 cases, Netherlands has 34, Switzerland has 18, while Austria, Czech Republic, Finland, France, Ireland, Luxembourg and Norway have single-figure patient numbers. Of the UK total, 90 live in England, 8 in Scotland and 2 each in Wales and Northern Ireland. Austria has 7 probable cases, Belgium has 8, Germany has 29 and Ireland has 2. The International Food Safety Authorities Network (INFOSAN) has been following the multi-country outbreak since 10 May 2021.

Small melons, in particular Galia, are the possible vehicle of infection. _Salmonella_ Braenderup matching the outbreak strain was isolated in the UK in 2 of 200 sampled imported Galia melons from one batch from Honduras, and in Austria from a pooled sample of melons with unknown origin, including Galia, in April 2021.

The 2 UK positives were sampled on 1 Jun 2021 at a British wholesaler and were imported by vessel before being distributed to 10 businesses. Melons from Honduras were sampled by authorities in Luxembourg, Finland and Ireland but tested negative for _Salmonella_.

However, patients were detected from March 2021, before the positive batch was harvested and packed on 21 Apr 2021, indicating contaminated food vehicles had been circulating earlier. The batch arrived in the UK on 19 May 2021 and could only explain 6 cases.

Investigations initially looked at the supply chain of Galia, cantaloupe and honeydew melons from Honduras, Costa Rica and Brazil before the latter country was ruled out. One isolate matching the outbreak strain was detected in Finland from a boot swab sample in a hobby henhouse where hens had been fed melon rinds by their owner, who also tested positive for this strain. Further investigation is needed to identify the exact point and contributing factors of contamination along the production chain, including transportation, said the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC).

The Honduran producer finished harvesting melons in April 2021, and they are no longer on the market. No exports from Honduras are planned until the new season starts in December 2021. Galia melons from Honduras were sent to the EU via the Netherlands and redistributed to member states. They were exported mainly to the EU but also to the UK, USA and Japan.

During the 2021 season, 4000 samples were collected at different points of the production and packing chain and no positives were reported for any pathogens routinely monitored, including _Salmonella_.

Reports peaked in April and May 2021, when 198 and 128 cases were reported, respectively. The patient age range is from below 1 to 101 years old, and women have been more affected [than] men. Belgium, the Netherlands, and Norway have recorded outbreaks or cases in nursing homes.

Out of 197 confirmed cases with information available, almost two-thirds reported having consumed any type of melons 7 days prior to illness onset. The majority of melons eaten by patients, including Galia, Charentais, honeydew, and cantaloupe, were traced back to the Honduran producer. Galia melons were consumed by nearly half of 140 cases.

[Melons grow on the ground and can be contaminated through tainted irrigation water. The flesh is then contaminated when the rind is cut into. All the cases are from Europe except for 6 cases in North America without a clear epidemiological link to the European cases. The last post from ProMED was on 19 Jun 2021 and at that time 99 cases were reported, with 52 in the UK and one in North America (Canada). The North American cases are genetically, but not clearly epidemiologically, related to the European cases.

"The Galia melon [which I had not heard of], also known as sarda in South East Asia, is a type of F1 hybrid melon originating from a cross between the green-flesh melon cultivar 'Ha-Ogen' and the netted-rind melon cultivar 'Krimka.' Developed in Israel at the Neve Yaar Research Center of the Agricultural Research Organization and released in 1973, the Galia melon was named after the developer's daughter, whose name means 'God's wave' in Hebrew."

"Galias are now grown in Algeria, Brazil, Guatemala, Portugal, Spain, Morocco, Southern US regions, Costa Rica, Panama, Honduras, Greece, Turkey, Israel, and Egypt" (Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galia_melon).

Galias are not particularly difficult to grow. - Mod.LL
