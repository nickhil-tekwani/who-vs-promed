Rust attacks wheat crop
-----------------------
Wheat crop in Swabi [district, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province] has been attacked by rust disease due to continued rains and cloudy weather for the last week. Farmers and agriculture experts said the disease would badly curtail the yield. Growers fear that more rains would increase humidity and further spread the disease.

The local farmers said they were not aware of what possible measures to take. "For the last several years when there are incessant rains the disease [has] attacked the wheat crop," they said.

Former director general [of] agriculture, Allah Dad Khan, said fungus already present had caused the disease. "The rust harms stem and leaves and reduces production. There was also attack of 'yellow rust' and 'brown rust'." He said it might reduce the production by 25 to 40 percent in the district.

He said the farmers should immediately remove the plants attacked [and] consult the agriculture experts to spray their crop with a recommended pesticide. The farmers should also avoid outdated seeds as they invited rust attack.

[There are 3 known rusts that can affect wheat:
Wheat stem rust (also called black rust) is caused by the fungus _Puccinia graminis_ f. sp. _tritici_. Overall yield losses of up to 80 percent are reported, but some fields are totally destroyed. New races are emerging, and the most dangerous at present is strain Ug99 (see ProMED-mail post 19990519.0812), which has overcome the major resistance gene Sr31 used in our current wheat varieties. Since then Ug99 strains have spread and were reported from southern Africa for the 1st time in 2009 opening up routes of transmission for the southern hemisphere (see ProMED-mail post 20100602.1834).

Stripe rust (also called yellow rust) of cereals is caused by the fungus _Puccinia striiformis_ var. _striiformis_. The disease affects wheat, some barley varieties, triticale (wheat/rye hybrids), and a number of wild grasses. It causes yellow leaf stripes and stunting of plants with yield losses of 40 to 100 percent in wheat.

Leaf rust (also called brown rust) of wheat is caused by the fungus _Puccinia recondita_. Related pathogens affect barley and rye. The disease reduces the photosynthetic potential of the plant and can cause yield losses of over 40 percent in individual fields. Symptoms include brick-red pustules on leaves, stems, and later on heads. Epidemic severity increases exponentially over time and may appear to "explode" during favourable weather.

Rust spores are wind dispersed in several cycles during the cropping season and are also spread by mechanical means and with infected plant material (straw, grain). The fungi need living tissue to survive between seasons and cannot survive on seed, stubble, or in soil. Volunteer cereal plants and some wild grasses may generate a "green bridge" providing inoculum to infect new crops. Disease management relies mainly on timely fungicide applications, choice of crop cultivars and control of volunteer crop plants. Early discovery of infection is important so action can be taken to limit pathogen spread as well as build-up of inoculum.

New strains of cereal rusts with increased virulence are emerging worldwide. These include strains that show additional fungicide resistances and/or the ability to break down genetic resistance of specific host varieties. Monitoring and resistance breeding programmes have been established in different regions for early detection of new rust strains and to attempt to stay ahead of pathogen evolution. Development of crop varieties with stable resistance to multiple rusts is particularly difficult since the pathogens can be expected to mutate independently resulting in a range of changing combinations of strains.

From the report above it is unclear to which degree each rust is thought to be involved in the problem. The warning against "outdated seeds" above may either refer to potential contamination of seed lots with rust spores, or to seed of susceptible varieties that are no longer recommended for the area.
