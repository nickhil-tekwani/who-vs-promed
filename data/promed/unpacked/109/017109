------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is an interesting observation that: "Egyptian scientists have found H5N1 viruses in Egyptian poultry that have 2 mutations that are usually associated with adaptation to mammals", suggesting that this is associated with the recent increase in avian H5N1 cases of influenza in the general virus population of Egypt, and that this may have been responsible for the current upsurge of H5N1 avian influenza in Egypt, but which has been absent elsewhere.

However, other observations do not support this conclusion. In particular, a recent analysis of viruses from 2 human patients in Egypt showed no major genetic changes.

Of recent human cases in November/December 2014, all or nearly all of the patients had contact with poultry, and no signs of human-to-human transmission of H5N1 have been reported. No doubt these cases indicate that the virus has changed genetically in some way, but not by mutation at sites previously associated with ability to initiate avian-to-human transmission.

My assessment of this work is that it is too early to draw any definitive conclusions.

Indeed it may require combinations of mutations rather than a mutation at single sites to change the host range of an avian virus.
