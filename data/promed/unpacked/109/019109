A total of 4 people were infected with Shiga toxin-producing _E. coli_ (or enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ EHEC) O157 in 2017 from exposure to raw pet food, according to a Public Health England (PHE) report. In August 2017, the cluster infected with genetically related strains of EHEC O157 was identified. The strains possessed the Shiga toxin (stx) 2a subtype, associated with more severe disease and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). In all, 3 patients were hospitalized and one person died following development of HUS. Contact with dogs and consumption of raw carrots were the only exposures common to all cases. Interviews found 3 cases had been exposed to dogs fed a raw meat-based diet, specifically, tripe. In 2 cases, the tripe was purchased from the same supplier.

Although one case was not linked to raw pet food, as cattle and sheep are the main reservoir of EHEC in the UK, exposure may have occurred through a different route. It could also have come from an animal fed a raw meat-based diet without the patient being aware of or able to recall it.

Tripe is the edible lining of a cow's stomachs, and raw tripe could contain pathogens if animals are infected. Although tripe is cleaned and treated for human consumption, many raw pet foods contain green tripe, a raw product not cleaned and containing untreated contents of the cow's stomachs.

EHEC isolated from a sample of raw tripe was different to the strain causing illness in humans. The same EHEC was detected in a swab of a preparation bench at the producer's premises. PHE said although the outbreak strain was not recovered from tripe, this could be because samples tested were not necessarily from the batches fed to the case's pets; the infectious dose of EHEC is very low and there may be uneven distribution of bacteria in the products. "Nevertheless, isolation of [Shiga toxin-producing _E. coli_ (STEC)] did provide evidence for microbiological contamination of tripe and its pathogenic risk to human health and that it was a plausible transmission route in this outbreak. This adds to the evidence of raw pet food as a risk factor for zoonotic transmission of [gastrointestinal] pathogens, which is already relatively widely accepted for _Salmonella_, _Listeria_ and _Campylobacter_," added the agency.

Raw pet foods could cause human disease if contaminated products are eaten, handled or via secondary transfer from contact with contaminated surfaces such as kitchen surfaces or dog bowls. Feeding raw meat to pets has grown in popularity due to increasing availability and beliefs it provides health benefits to animals.

Although still rare, an increase in EHEC cases with exposure to raw meat-based diets was detected in 2017. There have also been more raw pet food incidents in 2017, with 8 being microbiological, suggesting an increasing trend in potential risk to humans from raw pet food, said PHE.

In the UK, EHEC serogroup O157 is the most common type, and around 700 cases are reported annually in England compared with around 10 000 _Salmonella_ and 60 000 _Campylobacter_ cases.

Food, water and environmental samples were collected by Environmental Health Practitioners (EHPs) from the freezers of 2 cases, an implicated producer of raw pet feed and a pet food shop. All samples from the North East raw pet food producer and the case's freezer were positive for EHEC. EHEC was isolated from one sample of raw tripe, but it was EHEC O100:H30 positive for the stx2g gene, so not the same as the strain infecting human cases. The South East samples from the case's freezer and pet food shop were negative for EHEC.

The company sourced tripe from 2 suppliers, but it was not possible to find which of these the finished product came from. A 3rd source went into administration [bankruptcy] in July 2017 primarily due to hygiene issues, but it was used before the onset of cases.

Isolates of EHEC O157 from the 4 cases were all phage type (PT) 21/28 stx2a. Onset dates ranged from 23 Jun to 23 Jul 2017. Of the confirmed cases, 2 were female and 2 were male. The median age was 6, as 3 cases were under 10 years of age, with a range from 6 to 45 years. All 4 cases reported diarrhea, and 3 had bloody diarrhea accompanied by vomiting. Duration of illness ranged from 4 to 8 days. For the person who died, the cause of death was HUS and sepsis.

Whole genome sequencing (WGS) for national surveillance facilitated identification of a novel vehicle for STEC transmission, according to the report. "WGS enabled the detection and investigation of this small, nationally dispersed cluster, which would have gone undetected prior to the introduction of WGS due to the commonly reported PT (PT21/28), comprising approximately a third of EHEC O157 cases in England."

PHE has published guidance to help reduce the risk of infection from handling raw pet foods, which can be found at https://www.gov.uk/guidance/raw-pet-foods-handling-and-preventing-infection.

[While cattle remain the primary source for EHEC, usually by contaminated ground beef, by soiling of irrigation water or direct exposure to the animal or its environment, this proposed vehicle for transmission is unusual. However, it shouldn't be unexpected since "green" tripe is raw, unwashed, unbleached, unscalded stomach tissue which can contain both the muscular and mucosal layers (the latter of which is often stained green and/or brown from vegetation eaten by the cows, hence the name). As such "green" tripe may be the source of virtually any bovine gastrointestinal pathogen and an excellent means with which to infect other susceptible species.

Green tripe differs from traditional beef tripe for human consumption (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tripe) which is made from only the muscle wall (the interior mucosal lining is removed) of only the first 3 chambers of a cow's stomach: the rumen (blanket/flat/smooth tripe), the reticulum (honeycomb and pocket tripe), and the omasum (book/bible/leaf tripe). Abomasum (reed) tripe is seen less frequently, owing to its glandular tissue content. Tripe typically refers to cow (beef) stomach but includes stomach of any ruminant, including cattle, sheep, deer, antelope, giraffes, and their relatives. Tripas, the related Spanish word, also refers to culinary dishes produced from any animal with a stomach. In some cases, other names have been applied to the "tripe" of other animals. For example, tripe from pigs may be referred to as paunch, or hog maw. Tripe is eaten in many parts of the world. Tripe soup is made in many varieties in the Eastern European cuisine. Tripe dishes eaten by humans include andouille (French poached, boiled and smoked cold tripe sausage) and breakfast sausages (most commercially produced sausages in the US contain pork and beef tripe as filler). While tripe can be made safe to eat via washing, bleaching, scalding, removing the mucosal layer, etc. it is clearly not without risk especially when the aforementioned steps are skipped and/or cross-contamination occurs during the cleaning/disinfection of the muscular portion of the stomachs.

It is not stated in the post if the affected individuals received antimicrobials early in their illnesses, which can increase the risk of HUS. Fatalities from EHEC infection generally occur when central nervous symptoms occur during HUS. - Mods.LL/JH
