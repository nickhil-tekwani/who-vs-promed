Outbreak alert
------------
An outbreak of measles could easily happen in South West Wales because of the number of children not being vaccinated with the MMR jab, a health chief has warned. Public Health Wales is currently investigating an outbreak of the disease at a North Wales school. Now director of public health at Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board, Dr Sara Hayes, has warned a similar outbreak could be seen in the area due to a shortfall in the number of children being vaccinated. Ms Hayes said: "All children need to receive two doses of the MMR vaccination, which protects against mumps and rubella as well as measles. "Until 95 per cent of children have received two doses of the vaccine, there is still a risk that measles outbreaks will happen.

"In the counties of Swansea, Bridgend and Neath Port Talbot (the areas covered by the health board), latest figures show that 14.6 per cent of 5-year-old children have had no doses of MMR or only one. "This means that more than 800 children in the area are not fullyvaccinated, and this is not enough to prevent outbreaks. "Although children should receive their first dose of MMR at 12 months of age and the second at 3 years and 4 months, it is never too late to catch up on missed doses. "To avoid an outbreak in the Abertawe Bro Morgannwg area, I am urging parents whose children are not fully vaccinated to speak to their GP as soon as possible." More than 40 cases of measles are currently being investigated after the outbreak at Ysgol Eifionydd, in Porthmadog. [North Wales]. Dr Richard Roberts, head of the vaccine preventable disease programme of public health Wales, added: "Measles is highly contagious, spreads very easily and can be extremely serious. "The outbreak in North Wales continues to make children very ill. "If this kind of outbreak can happen there, it can happen in any school in Wales.

"Although the uptake of MMR in Wales has improved greatly over the past 10 years, it is still the case that thousands of Welsh children enter school each year not fully vaccinated and at risk of catching measles, mumps or rubella. "Thousands will leave school in the same vulnerable condition. "MMR is a safe and effective vaccine, and is available free from your local surgery," he added.

Confirmed measles cases in England and Wales and across Euriope: update to end of March 2012
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The provisional total of laboratory-confirmed cases of measles this year in England and Wales with onset dates to the end of March 2012 has reached 253, compared to 200 in the same period in 2011. The majority of cases with onset in February and March were diagnosed in the North West region where there is an on-going outbreak [data tabulated in the original text, accessible via the source URL]. More than 60% (86/136) of the cases in the North West are in unvaccinated children under 10 years, of which 26 are infants less than a year of age, and the [virus] genotype is B3. In comparison, an outbreak in North Wales which began in February has primarily been linked with one secondary school with spread to younger unvaccinated children within families in the locality. The [virus] genotype associated with this outbreak is D8. Letters were sent to local schools and general practitioners to remind them of the need to ensure children have received two doses of MMR vaccine. Immunisation sessions were organised in schools in the affected area [2, 3]. The South East and London regions have consistently reported cases throughout this period and the predominate [virus] genotype is D4.

The latest UK MMR vaccine coverage data published last month for children reaching their second or fifth birthday in October to December 2011 quarter shows 91.9% of 2 years olds have received their first dose and 86.7% of five years olds completed the two dose course [4]. These are the highest levels recorded since combined UK data were first produced in 1995.

Across Europe, 2012 data from the 29 EU and EEA countries is only available to the end of January; nearly 600 measles cases were reported for this month of which 63% were identified in Romania. In addition, a large measles outbreak, nearly 4500 cases between 1st January and 3rd March, is ongoing in the west of Ukraine which borders Hungary, Poland and Slovakia . There have been vaccine shortages in the Ukraine since 2010 and without effective control measures the epidemic is expected to accelerate and spread geographically during the measles peak transmission season from February to June. The European Football Championship will be jointly hosted by Ukraine and Poland in June 2012 and visitors to the event are encouraged to ensure they are fully vaccinated.

[A significant feature of the current outbreaks of measles virus infection in England and Wales is that they are independent events driven by locally inadequate levels of immunisation. The extensive outbreak of measles encompassing the North-West of England, around and beyond Merseyside, is caused by measles virus genotype B3, whereas the outbreak in geographically adjacent North Wales is associated with measles virus genotype D8. In contrast measles virus genotype D4 has been responsible for measles cases occurring in London and the South-East of England.

The HPA figures for confirmed cases of measles in England and Wale for the first quarter of 2012 are the following: London 29, East England 3, North West 136, South East 44, South West 4, West Midlands 3, Wales 33, Yorks & Humber one. - Mod.CP]

Potential Measles Case at Kinnikinnick School District
---------------------------------------------
ROSCOE: Students and parents are on alert over a potential case of measles at Ledgewood School in the Kinnikinnick School District.

The Health Department cautions this is only a suspected case. But, since measles is so contagious, they had to notify families. Some symptoms include fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes, and rashes. School administrators won't give any details about the case, but expect test results within the next few days. Until then, kids who haven't received measles vaccine are asked to stay home for the next three weeks
