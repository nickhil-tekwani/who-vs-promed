After affecting 32 residents from Kampung Baru Sungkap Para, the
chikungunya outbreak has spread to another village. In Kampung Batu
Lima, Jalan Jeniang, Gurun, near here, 2 villagers were admitted to
Yan Hospital, in Yan, after they developed symptoms of chikungunya.

State Health deputy director Dr Shahidan Hashim said the 2 victims
were warded on Monday [15 Dec 2008] after they were found suffering
from fever, joint pains and rashes on their bodies. This brings the
number of victims of the chikungunya outbreak in the state to 34.

"We have despatched medical officers to the newly affected village to
check on other residents," added Dr Shahidan. He said 29 of the 32
villagers from Kampung Baru Sungkap Para were still undergoing
treatment at Sultan Abdul Halim Hospital.

The chikungunya outbreak appears to be spreading in this area. No
mention is made in this article about actions to control the _Aedes_
mosquito that is the vector of chikungunya virus. ProMeD would
appreciate receiving more information about this outbreak and vector
control measures being taken.
