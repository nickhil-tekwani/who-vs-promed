China's 3 biggest hepatitis B vaccine manufacturers have suspended production, the food and drug administration announced late on Thursday [2 Jan 2014]. BioKangtai, Tiantan Biological Products and Dalian Hissen Bio-Pharm failed to meet the 2010 good manufacturing practice (GMP) code for all pharmaceutical manufacturers by the deadline at the end of 2013. Those who did not reach the new standards must suspend production in 2014. Over the 1st 11 months last year [2013], hepatitis B vaccines produced by the 3 suppliers accounted for about 80 percent of total output.

Hepatitis B vaccines sold in China are produced by 7 companies, including British pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline. Only 2 have passed the new GMP certification, responsible for no more than 10 percent of sales. The statement by the China Food and Drug Administration (CDFA) says that companies may resume production after certification. Li Guoqing, a senior CFDA official, said vaccine supplies are sufficient to meet market demand.

The authority has clarified that vaccines produced before the deadline can still be sold. The 5 suspended manufacturers have inventories of qualified vaccines for about 25 inoculations, Li said. The authority will organize increased production if necessary, the official said.

China's vaccines are produced and regulated in accordance with international standards, and the hepatitis B vaccination program is vital in safeguarding children against the illness, according to the World Health Organization. Bernhard Schwartlander, China representative for the international health body, made these points during an interview with China Daily on Thursday [26 Dec 2013].

"Given that the hepatitis B virus is still around, it's important for babies to get vaccinated," he said. The WHO Beijing office met with the National Health and Family Planning Commission on Thursday [26 Dec 2013] to discuss the latest developments surrounding incidents in which 11 newborns have died after being inoculated against hepatitis B. According to Schwartlander, it's difficult to establish a causal link between the vaccines and the babies' deaths, since nearly all infants in China receive the vaccine as part of a very successful vaccination program.

Statistics from the commission showed that more than 16 million babies were born in China last year [2012], and 90 percent of them were covered by the program that offers hepatitis B vaccinations free of charge. "Without the immunization coverage, there might be a rapid increase of the disease," Schwartlander warned.

China initiated the hepatitis B vaccinations in 2002 under a nationwide immunization program that began in 1978 and aims to protect children from preventable diseases. The vaccines, which guard against more than 10 diseases, are all manufactured domestically, said Zhao Kai, a vaccine expert and academician with the Chinese Academy of Engineering. Schwartlander called the program "very successful," saying that hepatitis B prevalence among Chinese children under the age of 5 is now below 1 percent. But he conceded that some risks from the vaccination cannot be avoided.

According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, hepatitis B is a very safe vaccine, and most recipients have no problems with it. Severe problems are extremely rare. Dangerous allergic reactions are believed to occur about once in 1.1 million doses. "Medical education is important for the public to fully understand the benefit and risk of the vaccine, thus enabling them to make the right choice," Schwartlander said. It's important for governments to keep alert to problem vaccines and take preemptive measures, such as suspending the products during investigations, he said. But "vaccines produced by other registered manufacturers should be trusted," he added.

Health authorities in Gansu [province] said on Friday [27 Dec 2013] they are investigating a new hepatitis B vaccine-related death, the 11th such infant death since November [2013]. In the latest case, a baby in Lanzhou died after receiving the vaccination manufactured by the Dalian Hissen Bio-Pharm Inc. Earlier, in Loudi, Hunan province, a 2-month-old boy died on Wednesday [25 Dec 2013] after receiving a hepatitis B shot produced in Beijing. Most of the other deaths occurred after vaccinations from products made in Shenzhen [Guangdong province] by the BioKangtai biotech firm. The use of all BioKangtai hepatitis B vaccines has been suspended nationwide.

[The hepatitis B vaccines are perhaps the most secure of all virus vaccines. Hepatitis B vaccine is prepared from yeast cells using recombinant DNA technology. Hepatitis B-containing vaccines are inactivated, do not contain live organisms and cannot cause the diseases against which they protect. There are vaccines that are effective in preventing infection in individuals who produce specific antibodies to HBsAg (the surface antigen of the hepatitis B virus).

Around 10 to 15 percent of adults fail to respond to 3 doses of vaccine or respond poorly. Poor responses are mostly associated with age over 40 years and obesity.

The conditions for production of hepatitis B vaccine, however, are critical, and it is not surprising that there may be differences between different commercial products. It will be important to resolve this situation as soon as possible. - Mod.CP
