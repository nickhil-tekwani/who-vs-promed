A mother has warned of the dangers of wild swimming after her daughter ended up in hospital with a rare infection. The Bristol schoolgirl, aged 11, contracted life-threatening leptospirosis after swimming in the River Frome at Snuff Mills. Also known as Weil's disease, the bacterial infection is usually carried by rats and cattle and left her with grey lips, sickness, shaking, a fever, and aches.

The picturesque park in Stapleton is popular for a dip on a sunny day, with many families enjoying a swim in the River Frome. [The patient] had been swimming in the water on Tuesday [28 Jul 2020]and Wednesday [29 Jul 2020]. It was not until the Saturday [1 Aug 2020] that her symptoms started to develop, beginning with backache and then fatigue and fever.

[Her mother] said: "Her eyes went really red and her lips turned greyish." She rang 111 and was advised to take Taysha to A&E, where she was checked over thoroughly and doctors were happy for her to go home. Her symptoms persisted, however, and [her mother] said her daughter could "barely walk" after developing pains in her legs. She then started being sick and her temperature rose from 40 deg C [104 deg F] to 42.5 deg C [108.5] within the space of 20 minutes, after which [her mother] rang an ambulance. [The patient] was taken to Bristol Royal Hospital for Children and had a series of tests.

Doctors initially suspected she had a syndrome linked to coronavirus called PIMS (paediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome). [Her mother] said she tested negative for COVID-19, however, adding: "They said it was a bit of a mystery. "The infections and disease team were looking into all the bloods and monitoring her constantly, they were so good." [The patient] was in hospital for 3 days until doctors were confident enough to discharge her, but it was not until this week that her test results came back.

Doctors think the bacteria likely entered her body through an insect bite on her leg, although [her mother] said the bite was healing and it was not an open wound. [The girl] is better now and her mum says she has "got her smile back", but [she] is reluctant to risk wild swimming again. She stressed that [her daughter's] friends who were in the water were all fine and healthy afterwards and that she does not wish to panic anyone who has been swimming there.

[The woman] said she has been swimming at Snuff Mills since she was little and so has [her daughter], and they have never been ill before. However, she wants to raise awareness so that people can make informed choices about whether or not to go wild swimming. She said: "At the moment, my mind set is that she's not going into any lakes or rivers again. They [doctors] did say she wouldn't get it again and it's so rare but I don't want to take the risk. "I don't want to scare people and it's people's choice if they want to go in, but a lot of children will have a little scratch [where bacteria could enter] and I just don't want them to get poorly. "I think people should just be mindful -- it's not something that was ever at the top of my mind, I'd never heard of it."

[The Frome is a 20 mile (32 km)-long river that rises in South Gloucestershire, UK, and flows southwest through the city of Bristol (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Frome,_Bristol). Snuff Mills is a park in the Stapleton area of north Bristol on the banks of the River Frome, where it is also home to river otters (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snuff_Mills). A map showing the location of Snuff Mills can be found at https://goo.gl/maps/rxEGmfNtPfk5WFzSA.

Leptospirosis is a zoonotic spirochetal infection that is distributed widely throughout the world. Although leptospirosis is more common in tropical areas, it is also found in temperate areas. It is transmitted to humans by direct contact of abraded skin or mucous membranes with the urine of infected animals or by contact with wet soil, vegetation, or fresh (not salty) water that has been contaminated with infected animal urine. These animals are mostly asymptomatic but chronically infected with one of the several hundred serovars of the spirochete _Leptospira interrogans_.

Many species of wild and domestic animals (including rodents, dogs, cattle, swine, and perhaps river otters) are susceptible to chronic urinary infection with _Leptospira_. In carrier animals with chronic renal infections, leptospiruria persists for long periods or for life, and _Leptospira_ bacteria shed in urine may survive in fresh water or moist soil for weeks to months.

Leptospirosis is an occupational hazard for people who work outdoors or with animals; for example, workers in wet agricultural settings (such as rice field workers), ranchers, slaughterhouse workers, trappers, loggers, sewer workers, veterinarians, fishery workers, dairy farmers, or military personnel. Leptospirosis is also a risk from household exposure to infected pet animals or rodents.

Leptospirosis is a risk during recreational activities such as camping, fresh water swimming, canoeing, kayaking, rafting, golfing, and trail biking that involve exposure to water in lakes, rivers, or ponds contaminated by urine from _Leptospira_-infected animals.

Outbreaks frequently follow heavy rainfalls, flooding with fresh water, and increasing rodent numbers. - Mod.ML
