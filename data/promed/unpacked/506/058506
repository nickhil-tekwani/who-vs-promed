_Salmonella enterica_ serotype Stanley in peanuts
-------------------------------------------------
The Victorian Department of Human Services and Microbiological Diagnostic
Unit has identified _Salmonella enterica_ serotype Stanley in an unopened
180-gram packet of "Farmer Brand Shandong Peanuts."
These peanuts, originally from China, are distributed by Mei Heong Yuen
Food industries Pty Ltd (Singapore), and are manufactured by Heshan Mei
Heong Yuen Food Pty Ltd (China). The peanuts have a use by date of
28/8/2002. The Australian importer has initiated a voluntary recall of the
product, and informed the international distributor (Singapore).
On behalf of the Communicable Diseases Network of Australia, OzFoodNet is
collecting data on human cases of _Salmonella_ serotype Stanley throughout
Australia. At this stage, there are more than 50 human cases of _S._
Stanley so far this year, with the majority occurring in New South Wales.
States report that at least 30 percent of these cases have probably
acquired their infections overseas, which is often indicated by isolates
that are multiply resistant to antibiotics. OzFoodNet is asking State and
Territory investigators to determine if cases have consumed these
"Shandong" peanuts prior to illness.
International investigators may want to follow up human infections with
_Salmonella_ serotype Stanley. This product may have been distributed to
countries other than Australia.

contamination have involved alfalfa sprouts. The organism has been
described as a rare serotype more commonly associated with reptiles, but as
an emerging pathogen of humans. - Mod.ES
