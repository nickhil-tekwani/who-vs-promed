South Korea has reported new daily records for coronavirus cases and deaths as the omicron variant continues to spread rapidly across the country. The Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA) reported a staggering 621 328 new COVID-19 infections on Thursday [17 Mar 2022], including 62 among arrivals from overseas, according to the Yonhap news agency. Deaths also reached a record for a single day with 429 people confirmed to have lost their lives, bringing the overall toll since the start of the pandemic to 11 481.

The surging caseload comes as South Korea eases curbs designed to contain the spread of the virus, amid pressure from small businesses and others hit hard by the pandemic. The government is due to announce on Friday [18 Mar 2022] whether it will further relax restrictions, which currently include a late-night business curfew and a ban on private gatherings of more than 6 people.

Yonhap noted that the number of critically ill patients, which is being used to guide the official pandemic response, had dropped to 1159 from 1244 on Wednesday [16 Mar 2022].

The country has scaled back the test, track, tracing, and quarantine strategy that helped keep earlier waves in check and despite Thursday's [17 Mar 2022] record deaths, the country's fatality rate of 0.14% remains low relative to other countries. Health authorities also believe the omicron wave could be close to its peak, although the number of daily cases is far in excess of earlier predictions.

About 87% of South Korea's 52 million people have been fully vaccinated with 63% having received a booster shot, according to the KDCA. A government analysis of some 141 000 omicron cases reported in the country over the past year showed that there were no deaths among people under 60 who had received a booster shot, Son Young-rae, a health ministry official, said on Wednesday [16 Mar 2022], adding that the disease could be treated like the seasonal flu. "We see this could be the last major crisis in our COVID responses, and if we overcome this crisis, it would bring us nearer to normal lives," Son told a briefing.

A survey released earlier this week by Seoul National University's graduate school of public health, showed the number of South Koreans who worry about a serious health impact from COVID-19 had dropped to about 48%, the lowest since the surveys began in January 2020.

At the same time, those who think they are likely to contract the virus was at its highest. "People's awareness about the virus' danger has clearly changed," said professor Yoo Myung-soon who led the study. "Despite the omicron variant's much higher infectivity than delta, its relatively low fatality appears to have alleviated people's concerns."

[2] Vaccines
[A] Johnson & Johnson
Date: Thu 17 Mar 2022
Source: Med Page Today [edited]
https://www.medpagetoday.com/infectiousdisease/covid19vaccine/97722


Vaccine effectiveness with one dose of the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine remained remarkably stable for preventing symptomatic disease and hospitalizations, even during times when the delta variant was predominant in the United States, researchers found.

Vaccine effectiveness was 74% (95% CI 71-77) against symptomatic disease and 81% (95% CI 75-86) against hospitalization in states with high incidence of the delta variant in June to August 2021, reported Sebastian Schneeweiss, MD, ScD, of Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, and colleagues. In addition, effectiveness was stable over 180 days following vaccination, the authors wrote in JAMA Network Open (https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2790204).

The single-shot Johnson & Johnson vaccine has been the red-headed stepchild of the COVID vaccine family. Its use was paused in April 2021 due to cases of thrombosis and thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS), a rare, but fatal adverse event associated with the vaccine. The pause was lifted 10 days later, and the vaccine was recommended again. In November 2021, a 2nd dose of Johnson & Johnson vaccine was recommended at 2 months following the 1st dose.

But in December 2021, the CDC had seen enough. With 54 cases of TTS and 9 deaths and no clear pattern as to which patients were affected, the agency preferentially recommended Pfizer and Moderna's mRNA vaccines over Johnson & Johnson's vaccine. They stopped short of recommending against the vaccine, due to some populations who might opt for a one-dose vaccine despite the risks.

Amidst all the concern over waning immunity of the mRNA vaccines, the Johnson & Johnson vaccine had been largely overlooked. Slowly, data have begun to trickle in showing that while initial effectiveness was lower, the Johnson & Johnson vaccine may actually be more durable. However, these studies were smaller and were conducted prior to the delta variant, Schneeweiss' group said.

The researchers examined US health insurance claims data from March 2020 through August 2021. Adults ages 18 and older who received a single dose of Johnson & Johnson vaccine from 1 Mar 2020 to 17 Aug 2021 were matched by location, age within 4 years, sex, and comorbidity score with up to 10 unvaccinated controls. Data from a year prior were used to assess clinical utilization.

All participants were followed starting at 14 days after entry into the cohort until the occurrence of an outcome, receipt of any COVID vaccine, death, or the end of the study period.

Overall, 422 034 vaccinated individuals were matched with 1 645 397 unvaccinated controls. Mean age of both groups was about 55, with 56% women. Only 17% of unvaccinated controls were vaccinated by the end of the study period.

Throughout the study, vaccine effectiveness against recorded COVID symptomatic disease was 76% (95% CI 75-77) and 81% (95% CI 78-82) against COVID-related hospitalization. Not surprisingly, effectiveness was higher among adults younger than 65 vs those 65 and up (78% vs 72%, respectively), and among non-immunocompromised individuals vs those who were immunocompromised (77% vs 64%).

Notably, Schneeweiss' team observed "sustained and stable vaccine effectiveness...to a maximum of 183 days after vaccination" in both the national cohort and in states with a high incidence of delta. "An analysis by calendar months from March through August 2021 showed no meaningful variation in vaccine effectiveness over calendar time before and during the delta variant surge," they wrote.

Limitations to the data include potential under-recording of baseline factors or events due to the data source used, under-recording of COVID vaccine administration in insurance claim data, and lack of documentation for asymptomatic infections.

"These results suggest that the vaccine effectiveness observed in the [phase III clinical] trial translate into clinical practice, last for at least 6 months after vaccination, and remain effective amid high delta variant incidence," the authors concluded.

[B] Moderna

https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/17/us/second-booster-covid-moderna.html


Moderna said late Thursday [17 Mar 2022] that it has asked the Food and Drug Administration for emergency authorization of a 2nd booster of its coronavirus vaccine for all adults, a significantly broader request than Pfizer and BioNTech filed for their shot this week.

The request is likely to intensify the latest round of an ongoing scientific debate over how long protection from the 2 most-used vaccines in the United States lasts in the face of new variants.

On Tuesday [15 Mar 2022], Pfizer and its German partner, BioNTech, asked for emergency authorization for a 2nd booster for those 65 and older. The firm's request was based heavily on data from Israel, where such shots are authorized for a somewhat broader group.

Federal health officials have said they are concerned about waning potency of the booster shot that was authorized for both Moderna and Pfizer in the fall [2021]. But although there are indications that regulators could move swiftly on Pfizer's request, it is unclear how favorably they will view Moderna's more sweeping application.

Moderna said its request covered all adults so the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and health care providers could determine the appropriate use of a 2nd booster, including for those at higher risk of COVID-19 disease because of age or underlying medical conditions. About 48% of eligible American adults, or 93 million people, have gotten booster shots, according to the C.D.C. More than two-thirds of those 65 or older who are eligible have gotten them.

Moderna said its request was partly based on recent data on how well its vaccine protected against the omicron variant in the United States and Israel.

Outside scientists are sharply divided over whether another dose is necessary now, and if so, for whom. In an interview on Friday [11 Mar 2022], Dr. Peter J. Hotez, a vaccine expert at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, said, "I'm a strong proponent of giving a second booster now."

He said the 1st booster shot had "made a huge difference" in bolstering protection against hospitalization and even infection from the omicron variant.

"It's also clear that protection is waning now pretty quickly a few months after your 3rd dose," he said. "So it's short-lived. The hope is that a 2nd booster would restore it."

But Dr. Jesse L. Goodman, a former chief scientist for the F.D.A., said: "While protection is waning against mild infections, without more information we do not yet know to what extent, if any, protection is waning against severe disease." Nor it is clear, he said, "to what degree and for how long another booster might help."

Among the data the companies cited was a study released last month [February 2022] by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that found the effectiveness of Pfizer's and Moderna's vaccines against hospitalization dropped from 91% 2 months after a booster shot to 78% after 4 months. The study presented a broad snapshot; it did not break down hospitalizations by age, presence of underlying conditions or other factors.

China's At-Risk Elderly; Hong Kong Hits 1 Million: Virus Update
---------------------------------------------------------------
Chinese President Xi Jinping has pledged to reduce the economic impact of his COVID fight, a shift in the policy that weighed heavily on the world's 2nd-largest economy. Only half of the country's oldest residents are fully vaccinated.

More than one million people have contracted the virus in Hong Kong since the start of the year [2022], and 5000 died, after the city entered its most brutal outbreak since the pandemic began. More than 40% of the elderly and disabled in its care homes have been infected.

China's technology hub of Shenzhen will allow factories and public transport in 5 districts to resume operations, while the rest of the city remains in lockdown. Shanghai is expanding its mass testing to regions with lower risk.

Elsewhere, Singapore's omicron wave is subsiding. Moderna Inc. filed for U.S. regulatory clearance of a 2nd booster shot for all adults, covering more people than Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE's emergency authorization request for those over 65.

Singapore's Wave Subsides (6:08 p.m. HK)
----------------------------------------
Singapore's omicron wave "has clearly peaked, is subsiding, and picking up pace" based on daily case counts, health minister Ong Ye Kung said in a Facebook post. The number of people hospitalized is falling more gradually, with a lag compared to the drop in daily cases.

China's Vulnerable Elderly (5:24 p.m. HK)
-----------------------------------------
Only half of Chinese aged 80 and older are fully vaccinated, highlighting a key vulnerability as the country grapples with its worst outbreak since Wuhan and the prospect of reopening to the world.

About 51% of over 80-year-olds have received 2 shots and some 20% have gotten boosters, health officials told reporters at a briefing in Beijing Friday [18 Mar 2022]. While 87.9% of China's 1.4 billion people have been vaccinated with 2 shots -- a high percentage globally -- the numbers decline with age.

The numbers also show why China is reluctant to ease its strict COVID Zero strategy just yet. The country is at risk of a situation like Hong Kong's, where an even larger proportion of elderly people is unvaccinated -- some 63% of those over 80.

China to Stick to Dynamic COVID Zero (3:35 p.m. HK)
---------------------------------------------------
China will stick to the dynamic COVID Zero policy, which has worked well and is scientific, Wang Hesheng, vice head of the National Health Commission, said.

The strategy has had some short-term impacts on economies in some regions, but not all economic effects can be blamed on the policy.

A revised treatment protocol isn't a relaxation of the existing COVID control policy, Jiao Yahui, an official at the commission, said.

H.K. Says Report Self-Tests, Or Else (1:47 p.m. HK)
---------------------------------------------------
Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam called on residents to promptly report positive results of home COVID tests or face legal consequences, amid reports that the city's sweeping outbreak is being under-counted. ...

[4] Vaccine boosters

https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2022/03/studies-show-vaccines-protect-against-serious-omicron-illness


Studies show vaccines protect against serious omicron illness
-------------------------------------------------------------
A pair of new studies that sized up how COVID-19 vaccines affected hospitalizations, including during the omicron variant surge, found that mRNA vaccines were highly effective against severe illness and that unvaccinated people were 12 times more likely to be hospitalized compared with those who had received a booster, with the risk especially high in Black patients.

In other COVID-19 developments, Moderna yesterday [17 Mar 2022] filed for approval for emergency use for 4th doses of its mRNA vaccine as surges in Asian hot spots continued at very high levels.

Vaccines, boosters crucial tool
-------------------------------
The authors of both studies assessed how well vaccination protected against hospitalization during the worst of the omicron surge and compared it with how well the vaccines held up during the delta surge. Both studies were published today [18 Mar 2022] in Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR).

The 1st study examined how mRNA vaccines protected against the most severe outcomes, defined as ventilator treatment or death. The authors looked for any differences between patients who had gotten their primary series and those who had also received a 3rd dose. [Tenforde MW, Self WH, Gaglani M, et al. Effectiveness of mRNA vaccination in preventing COVID-19-associated invasive mechanical ventilation and death -- United States, March 2021-January 2022. MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. ePub: 18 March 2022. DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm7112e1]

The case-control study is based on data from a multistate hospital network and included adults ages 18 and older who were hospitalized with COVID-19 symptoms from 11 Mar 2021 through 23 Jan 2022. Of 7544 patients, 1440 had lab-confirmed COVID and 6104 controls tested negative.

Patients who received 2 or 3 doses had a 90% reduced risk for ventilator treatment or death from COVID-19. During the omicron surge, those who had received a booster dose had a 94% reduced risk of the 2 severe outcomes.

The authors said that most vaccinated people who were on a ventilator who died were older and had complex underlying symptoms, especially suppressed immune systems.

"These findings reinforce the highly protective effects of up-to-date COVID-19 vaccination against severe illness and death among adults, including against current SARS-CoV-2 variants," the group wrote.

In the 2nd study, another group examined weekly hospitalization rates during delta and omicron circulation, hoping to tease out any differences based on vaccination status or racial group. Their data were from the COVID-Net surveillance system, which includes 99 counties in 14 states. [Taylor CA, Whitaker M, Anglin O, et al. COVID-19-asssociated hospitalizations among adults during SARS-CoV-2 delta and omicron variant predominance, by race/ethnicity and vaccination status -- COVID-NET, 14 States, July 2021-January 2022. MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. ePub: 18 March 2022. DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm7112e2]

The investigators found that people who weren't vaccinated were 12 times more likely to be hospitalized than were vaccinated people who were boosted, and those who had only received their primary series were 3 times more likely to be hospitalized.

During omicron, hospitalization rates for Black patients increased compared to other racial or ethic groups. More specifically, hospitalization rates for Blacks were 4 times higher than for non-Hispanic whites, rising to the highest level for any group during the pandemic.

The researchers said implementing strategies to boost vaccine acceptance by removing barriers for vaccination in Black adults is an urgent public health priority.

Moderna files for 4th-dose emergency use
----------------------------------------
In other US developments, Moderna yesterday [17 Mar 2022] said it submitted an application to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for emergency use authorization (EUA) for 4th doses of its mRNA vaccine. The move came 2 days after Pfizer-BioNTech filed an EUA application for 4th doses.

Moderna's request applies to any adult who has received an initial booster of any authorized or approved COVID-19 vaccine, which it says gives health officials and health providers more flexibility to targeting 4th doses, especially for those at higher risk. For comparison, Pfizer's request for 4th dose authorization applies to those ages 65 and older.

The activity surrounding 4th doses comes as the nation braces for a possible spike in COVID-19 activity, based on the experience of some European countries.

Anthony Fauci, MD, White House chief medical advisor, told ABC News that the United States can expect to see increased cases from the more transmissible BA.2 omicron subvariant in the weeks ahead, but it might not produce huge spikes in hospitalizations and deaths.

China, Hong Kong cases climb
----------------------------
In global COVID news, China today [18 Mar 2022] reported 4130 new cases, 1742 listed as asymptomatic, with the more transmissible omicron variant pushing cases to 2-year highs. More than half of today's [18 Mar 2022] new cases were from Jilin province, one of the handful of locations that are under lockdown.

At a briefing today [18 Mar 2022], Chinese officials emphasized that the country must learn from Hong Kong's painful lesson about deaths in vulnerable people by ensuring that older people are vaccinated, according to Reuters. Currently, only 19.7% of Chinese seniors have been boosted, and only 50.7% are fully vaccinated. [https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/covid-vaccination-rate-people-aged-over-80-china-relatively-low-official-2022-03-18/]

Meanwhile, Hong Kong today [18 Mar 2022] reported 20 082 new cases, along with 206 more deaths. Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam today [18 Mar 2022] acknowledged that tough COVID-19 measures are causing a strain on people and the financial sector and signaled that authorities will revisit the issue next week rather than in the middle of April [2022] when the rules are set to expire.

In other global developments:
• Samoa is on lockdown after identifying its 1st local COVID-19 case.
• In the United Kingdom, COVID-19 cases continue to rise in all age-groups, with hospitalizations also increasing, according to the BBC, which cited a weekly report from the Office of National Statistics. [https://www.bbc.com/news/health-60792087]
• The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control today [18 Mar 2022] released guidance on COVID-19 testing, vaccination, and protective measures in Ukrainian refugee settings.

[Re Ukrainian refugees: "...many of the people fleeing Ukraine are expected to not be fully vaccinated against COVID-19.

"In the absence of documented evidence of prior vaccination, eligible children and adults from Ukraine should be offered a primary vaccination course against COVID-19 as well as a booster dose, but elderly, pregnant women, the immunocompromised and individuals with underlying conditions at higher risk of severe disease should be prioritised. A physical or digital record of vaccination should be provided, for future reference, including for people in transit to another country.

"If not already vaccinated, frontline workers (healthcare workers, volunteers, etc.) in reception centres should also receive a complete primary course of COVID-19 vaccination and a booster dose according to national guidelines.

"To reduce the risk of introduction of COVID-19 cases in reception centres, testing of all displaced persons on arrival at centres should be considered. If no testing capability exists, those exhibiting COVID-19 compatible symptoms should be triaged and managed as possible cases, with appropriate supportive care.

"Additionally, other measures that can be considered include ensuring accessibility and use of clean water, soap, sanitiser and implementation of proper hand hygiene; promotion of respiratory etiquette; use of face mask, when proper physical distancing cannot be maintained; ensuring proper ventilation of reception centres; ensuring proper cleaning and disinfection of the reception centres.

"To improve understanding and compliance with infection prevention and control measures, multilingual signage (information/infographics with pictograms) could be made available in reception centres.

"Communicating the risks and prevention of COVID-19 with the displaced population requires community engagement and health communication strategies that are adapted to meet their language, cultural and health literacy needs. ..." (ECDC) - Mod.LK]

- The Americas region reported 8.3% of cases and 33.2% of deaths during the past 24 hours, having reported more than 149.43 million cases, second to the European region as the most severely affected region. Brazil reported 45 882 cases followed by the USA and Chile. An additional 7 countries reported more than 1000 cases (Argentina, Mexico, Canada, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Martinique, and Uruguay) in the past 24 hours. Additionally, Peru, Colombia, and Cuba reported more than 500 but fewer than 1000 cases.

- The European region reported 51.8% of cases and 34.5% of deaths over the last 24 hours, as the most affected region, with cumulative cases exceeding 191.84 million. Some countries reporting few or no cases in the last 24 hours or longer include Belgium (21 cases), Portugal, and Tajikistan, among others. A total of 30 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours, with 2 countries reporting more than 100 000 cases, 9 reporting more than 10 000, 19 reporting over 1000 cases, and 1 country reported more than 500 but fewer than 1000 cases.

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 0.29% of daily case numbers and 0.21% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 21.47 million cases. Iran (2580) reported the highest number of cases over the last 24 hours. Iraq and Pakistan reported more than 500 but fewer than 1000 cases over the last 24 hours. Jordan, Morrocco, Lebanon, Tunisia, Egypt, and Somalia, among others, did not report any cases over the last 24 hours.

- The African region reported 0.16% of daily cases and 0.14% of total deaths during the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 8.51 million cases. South Africa (1681), reported the highest number of cases over the last 24 hours followed by Zimbabwe and Zambia. Most of the remaining countries reported below 100 or 50 cases. A total of 20 countries did not report any cases over the last 24 hours. The low reported numbers may not be a true reflection of the prevalent COVID-19 situation in the region as vaccine coverage remains low.

- The Western Pacific region reported 59.3% of daily case numbers and 21.7% of deaths in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 36.86 million cases. South Korea (407 017), reported the highest number of cases over the last 24 hours followed by Vietnam, Japan, Australia, Malaysia, New Zealand, China, Singapore, and Brunei.

- The South East Asia region reported 2.4% of the daily newly reported cases and 8.3% of reported deaths in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 56.62 million cases.
