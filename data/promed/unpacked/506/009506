A new breed of tick has been found in Surry County and could be to blame for the deaths of 5 cows this year [2019].

The North Carolina Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services [NCDA&CS] issued a press release late Monday [8 Jul 2019] warning of the dangers of a relatively new species of the parasites: the Asian longhorned tick.

"State veterinarian Doug Meckes is reminding livestock and pet owners to be vigilant in their tick preventative measures during warm weather," stated a news release from Andrea Ashby, director of the department's public affairs division.

"Recently, the deaths of 5 cows in Surry County were linked to acute anemia caused by tick infestations. Samples were sent for identification to the N.C. Division of Public Health, Communicable Disease Branch, which confirmed Asian longhorned ticks."

"This is the 4th confirmed case in North Carolina since 2018, and the 1st case reported this year [2019]. Previous cases were found in Polk, Rutherford, and Davidson counties," Meckes said. "The deceased young bull brought to our Northwestern Animal Disease Diagnostic Lab had more than 1000 ticks on it, and the owner had lost 4 other cattle under the same circumstances."

The 1st case of the East Asia species identified in the U.S. was in West Virginia from a specimen taken from a white-tail deer in August 2010. Since then, 67 counties in the U.S. have confirmed local Asian longhorned tick populations. Virginia has the most counties, with 24 confirmed.

"It is a serious pest of livestock in its native regions," said the news release. "It is an aggressive biter and frequently builds intense infestations on animals, causing great stress, reduced growth and production, and blood loss. The tick can reproduce parthenogenetically (without a male), and a single fed female tick can create a localized population."

The Department of Agriculture made sure to point out that the tick has not been linked to any infections in humans in the U.S. at this point.

"The N.C. Division of Public Health, Communicable Disease Branch, is working with NCDA&CS to understand its distribution and monitor for diseases it may carry. The finding of this tick in the state corresponds with a continued effort by the N.C. Department of Health and Human Services to identify ticks in all 100 counties of the state. Veterinarians are encouraged to submit ticks they find on clinical patients to help track and identify tick populations in North Carolina."

Practicing vets interested in participating in this study are encouraged to email Dr. Alexis M. Barbarin at <NCTickID@dhhs.nc.gov>.

Ticks attack people, domestic animals, and wildlife. The state agency says that prevention remains the best method to deter tick-borne illnesses.

"Protect yourself while outdoors by wearing long clothing, wearing permethrin-treated clothing, and using DEET, picaridin, and other EPA-approved repellents. It is also good practice to shower immediately once you return home. Checking for ticks can help deter tick attachment or allow for early removal. For domestic animals, talk to your veterinarian about effective options to treat your pets and livestock for ticks."

If you believe you have located an Asian longhorned tick, the CDC encourages you to carefully remove the tick from the person or animal as quickly as possible. After placing the ticks in rubbing alcohol in a jar or a zipper-locked plastic bag, the CDC says to take the following steps:

- Contact your health department about steps you can take to prevent tick bites and tickborne diseases.
- Contact a veterinarian for information about how to protect pets from ticks and tick bites.
- Contact your state agriculture department or local agricultural extension office about ticks on livestock or for tick identification."

Regarding the impact of these ticks on humans, the CDC said, "In other countries, bites from these ticks can make people and animals seriously ill. As of 24 Jun 2019, no harmful germs that can infect people have been found in the ticks collected in the United States. Research is ongoing."

The most common symptoms of tick-related illnesses, according to the CDC, are:

- Fever/chills: With all tickborne diseases, patients can experience fever at varying degrees and time of onset.
- Aches and pains: Tickborne disease symptoms include headache, fatigue, and muscle aches. With Lyme disease you may also experience joint pain. The severity and time of onset of these symptoms can depend on the disease and the patient's personal tolerance level.
- Rash: Lyme disease, southern tick-associated rash illness (STARI), Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF), ehrlichiosis, and tularemia can result in distinctive rashes.

[The Asian longhorn tick, _Haemaphysalis longicornis_, is now well established in the eastern USA including North Carolina. As the report above indicates, this tick can reproduce asexually, producing hundreds to thousands of offspring in a relatively short period of time. This explains why cattle in North Carolina experienced extreme infestations, which are suspected of causing cattle deaths. Detection of this tick in 2010 and again in 2013 provides evidence that it had been in the USA for several years before it was identified in New Jersey in 2017. By whatever means -- birds or livestock movement or both -- the tick has been spread around and as of 2018 has been found in 9 states. It doubtless is now established in the eastern USA to stay. As noted earlier, either the tick is spreading rapidly, or surveillance has been intensified, or both.

As the report above indicates, this tick is a vector of important pathogens that infect people and domestic animals. Fortunately, so far, there is no evidence for this tick transmitting the tickborne pathogens that already occur in the eastern USA, such as Powassan virus and Lyme borreliosis. All tests for the presence of these pathogens in the ticks have been negative so far. One hopes that there will be intensified surveillance in broad areas in the eastern USA to find out whether there are additional longhorned ticks in new areas. Ticks can be extremely difficult to control once established in an area.
