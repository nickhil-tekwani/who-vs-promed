TULAREMIA - USA (NEW YORK CITY): REQUEST FOR INFORMATION
********************************************************
A ProMED-mail post
<http://www.healthnet.org/programs/promed.html>
Date: Thu, 23 Jul 1998 21:01:27 EDT
From: Larry Lutwick MD <DrLa516@aol.com>

I have had presented to me a recent fatal case of pulmonary tularemia (+
blood cultures) which occurred in an adult Afro-African man in Brooklyn,
New York that was proposed to have been tick-borne. It was stated by the
presenter that there have been cases of animal tularemia in the city in the
past. I have found two citations re: tularemia in NYC in NY State J Med
(1978 & 1983). Does anyone have any more recent information about human or
animal cases in NYC?
