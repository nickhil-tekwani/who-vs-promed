Polio cases spread in Indonesia
-------------------------------
4 young children in Indonesia are now confirmed to have polio, in the
country's 1st outbreak in a decade. Officials said other suspected
cases, all of which have been recorded in the same area of West Java
province, were still being investigated.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has called on Indonesia -- which
has generally good vaccination coverage -- to step up its campaign.
Officials have said they were confident they could prevent a major
outbreak.
The WHO said on Thursday [5 May 2005] that 2 more infants were
confirmed to have contracted the disease, after Indonesian
authorities announced earlier this week that 2 other children were
infected.
Polio is a waterborne disease which usually infects young children by
attacking the nervous system. It causes paralysis and muscular
atrophy, and there is no cure.
Polio vaccination rates across Indonesia as a whole stand at about 90
percent, but in western Java the rate has been around 55 percent.
Authorities have now launched a drive to immunise 5 million children
in the area.
Nigerian origins
----------------
DNA tests done on a viral sample from one of the infected children
has determined that the polio arrived in Indonesia from Nigeria, via
Saudi Arabia. Experts suspect the strain could have been carried by
migrant workers or pilgrims visiting Muslim holy sites in Saudi
Arabia.
The disease has all but disappeared in the developed world, but it is
still endemic in Nigeria, a problem that was made worse in 2003 when
Muslim clerics there spread rumours that the polio vaccine had been
contaminated to make Muslims infertile.
Until the middle of the 20th century, when a vaccine was discovered,
polio was endemic across the globe, and the international campaign
for universal vaccination has been one of the great successes in the
fight against disease of recent years.

Outbreak of polio in Indonesia
Updated 4 May 2005
------------------
A 2nd polio case was reported on 4 May 2005 by government sources.
The child is 20 months old and lives in the same village as the 1st
case, which was confirmed on 2 May. Genetic analysis has not yet
been carried out on the 2nd case, but it is extremely likely that the
2 are related viruses.
On 2 May 2005, the global reference laboratory in Mumbai, India,
confirmed a wild poliovirus type 1 isolate, from an acute flaccid
paralysis (AFP) case identified by the national surveillance system
in Giri Jaya village, Sukabumi District, West Java, Indonesia. The
case, an 18-month-old child who was previously unimmunized, had onset
of paralysis on 13 Mar 2005. 7 additional AFP cases in the village
of the index case have been detected, and are currently under
investigation. [The ages are reversed in comparison with the report above. -

The findings of the the investigation suggests recent introduction of
wild poliovirus; genetic analysis of the virus demonstrates that its
origin is in west Africa, similar to the viruses which caused the
2003/04 outbreak. Further analysis suggests the virus traveled to
Indonesia through Sudan, and is similar to recently isolated viruses
in Saudi Arabia and Yemen.
Indonesia has not had a wild poliovirus case since 1995.
Background
----------
21 Apr [2005]: the National Polio Laboratory in Bandung reported a
wild poliovirus isolate from an AFP case identified by the national
surveillance system in Giri Jaya village, Sukabumi District, West
Java.
23 Apr [2005]: a team comprising staff from the Ministry of Health,
West Java provincial health authority, Sukabumi district health
authority and WHO was in the infected area to conduct an immediate
investigation and response. On 26 and 27 Apr [2005], additional WHO
staff from the Regional Office, New Delhi, and from WHO Geneva joined
this team to support and guide the investigation and response.
The Ministry of Health, Indonesia, supported by WHO, immediately
intensified AFP surveillance in the infected district and surrounding
areas and conducted an outbreak response immunization (ORI) in 4
villages in the immediate area of the case, reaching 4000 children
aged less than 5 years. The intensified AFP surveillance has
detected 7 additional AFP cases in the village of the index case --
these are now under investigation. The findings of the investigation
demonstrate recent introduction of wild poliovirus.
26 Apr [2005]: the Ministry of Health, in collaboration with WHO,
sent the poliovirus isolate from this case to WHO's global reference
laboratory in Mumbai, India, for genetic sequencing.
Next steps
----------
The Ministry of Health Indonesia is planning a wide-scale
immunization response. Following a meeting on 29 Apr [2005] with the
Minister of Health and senior members of her team, the following next
steps have been agreed with partner agencies, including WHO and
UNICEF:
- An active house-to-house search for paralysed children will
continue in communities in the area of the confirmed case.
- Ministry of Health will issue a notification of the outbreak to
all provinces and to all surveillance units nationally to ensure that
no new paralysis cases anywhere in the country are missed.
- Ministry of Health continues to inform the press.
- 2 rounds of mopping-up immunization for all children aged less
than 5 years in West Java, Banten and Jakarta Provinces will be
conducted, to ensure that any transmission of wild poliovirus is
rapidly interrupted, and to rapidly improve population immunity over
a wide area of Java. The rounds should be conducted end-May and
end-June, targeting approximately 5.2 million children. Extension of
this activity to cover other areas (and possibly nationwide), will
depend on the results of intensified active surveillance in the other
provinces, and determination of wider spread.
Risks:
-----
The outbreak may continue to spread in the immediate area of the case
and outside. Circulation of wild poliovirus could be occurring in
other provinces in Indonesia; however this is unknown at the moment.
The costs of the mopping-up campaign are as follows: vaccine costs
USD 1.17 million and operations costs UDS 1.2 million.
Experience in polio eradication demonstrates that outbreaks can be
quickly contained with high-quality immunization campaigns which
reach every child under 5 years of age. Global eradication efforts
have reduced the number of polio cases from 350 000 annually in 1988,
to 1267 cases in 2004. 6 countries remain polio-endemic, with a
further 6 where polio transmission is re-established.
Polio status in Indonesia:
-------------------------
Indonesia has not had a wild poliovirus case since 1995.
The Ministry of Health conducted national immunization campaigns each
year from 1995 to 1997, followed by sub-national immunization
campaigns in 1999, 2000 and 2001. A further national campaign was
implemented in 2002 to maintain high levels of immunity in children.
Routine polio immunization coverage of infants has been consistently
above 90 percent nationally, although this average masks pockets
where coverage is [considerably] lower.
Indonesia's surveillance system for paralysis in children is meeting
globally recognized minimum standards, and a review by a team of
international experts in June 2003 found that surveillance was
adequate to detect wild poliovirus transmission.

2nd polio case in Indonesia
---------------------------
Indonesian authorities have confirmed a 2nd case of polio, a day
after announcing they had discovered the 1st case for almost 10
years. Officials said they were confident they could prevent a major
outbreak.
Indonesia has begun a programme of vaccinating millions of children in the
West Java region, where the disease was first found in an infant girl. The
2nd case, in the same area, was found in an 18-month-old boy. The virus is
thought to have come from Africa.
Polio is a waterborne disease which usually infects young children by
attacking the nervous system. It causes paralysis and muscular
atrophy, and there is no cure.
Dr Umar Achmadi, head of communicable disease control for the
Indonesian health ministry, said officials had investigated the
region for further infection in the wake of the first case.
Nigerian origins
----------------
The infection of a 20-month-old girl, which Indonesia announced on
Tuesday [3 May 2005], was the country's 1st recorded case of polio in
almost a decade.
DNA tests done on a viral sample from the infant girl have determined
the polio arrived in Indonesia from Nigeria, via Saudi Arabia.
Experts suspect the strain could have been carried by migrant workers
or pilgrims visiting Muslim holy sites in Saudi Arabia.
Dr Achmadi said he was "99 percent sure" the same viral strain had
affected the baby boy.

[The laboratory confirmation of other AFP cases residing in the same
area as the earlier case of poliomyelitis is unfortunate but not
surprising, as the presence of a case in an area with sub-optimal
vaccination coverages is highly likely to result in continued spread
of the poliovirus with resultant additional cases. It remains to be
seen if there are additional cases in other areas of Indonesia. -
