Taiwan: B Virus-Carrier Rock-monkeys in Wildlife Shelter Euthanized
--------------------------------------------------
4 Formosan rock monkeys in a wildlife shelter in Nantou County were put
down after they were diagnosed as carriers of monkey B virus. The Animal
Health Research Institute detected the virus in the monkeys and notified
the Council of Agriculture. [This virus is responsible for B virus disease
of macaques. It is now known as _Cercopithecine herpesvirus 1_, and is a
species of the genus _Simplexvirus_, subfamily _Alphaherpesvirinae_, to
which _Human herpesvirus 1_ also belongs. Its natural history in macaques
is similar to that of human herpesvirus 1 in humans. - Mod.CP]
In consideration for the safety of the staff at the shelter, the council
ordered the monkeys to be put to sleep. The council pointed out that the
virus spreads naturally among apes without causing any severe health
threats to them. However, when humans are bitten or scratched by monkeys
that carry the virus, the death rate can be as high as 70 percent.
The Nantou County government pointed out that, after 8 years of use, the
metal cages originally used to house 27 rock monkeys had begun to break and
rust. After receiving sufficient budgeting, the county relocated the
monkeys to the Animal Health Research Health Institute in order to commence
replacements and repairs. Out of the 27, 4 monkeys were diagnosed with the
virus. After receiving the news, the county government immediately sent
people to the institute to handle the situation. Environmentalists
expressed concern that, in order to take in wild animals, proper disease
diagnosis must be completed. They have already suggested that the council
should construct a larger shelter, but has yet received a response. They
also stated that, although there have never been any cases of human deaths
from bites and scratches by monkeys that carry the virus [in Taiwan?],
people should be wary and decrease contact with the monkeys. If bitten or
scratched, people should thoroughly cleanse!
their wounds with water and receive an [immunoglobulin] shot from the
council.
Hsinchu City Government yesterday notified owners of the monkeys and vets
to exercise extreme caution. The city zoo also invited vets to learn about
emergency procedures when dealing with virus-carrying monkeys. The zoo will
also perform diagnosis on all the monkeys currently in the facility.

[Cercopithecine herpesvirus 1 (monkey B-virus), when reactivated, can be
transmitted to humans usually via bites and scratches and more rarely by
other routes such as the eye. B virus infection of humans is mainly
restricted to animal handlers and pet owners, but there is a low risk in
any contact with macaques. The incubation period in humans can be as short
as 2 days, but several weeks is more common. Minor symptoms are followed
quickly by ascending paralysis, encephalitis, and death. The death rate can
be as high as 79 percent, and recovered patients may have neurologic
impairment. However, the use of the antivirals acyclovir or gancyclovir can
halt disease progression and assist recovery. Rapid diagnosis is essential.
There is evidence of distinct genotypes of cercopithecine herpesvirus 1,
and that isolates from different species of macaques vary in their
pathogenicity for humans. - Mod.CP]
