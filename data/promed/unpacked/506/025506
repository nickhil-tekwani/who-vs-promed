Detection of _Fusarium oxysporum_ f. sp. _melonis_ Race 1 in Soil in Colima
State, Mexico.

San Urbano s/n. 04120 Almeria, Spain; and F. J. Estrada and S. Montoya,

Mexico. Plant Dis. 88:1383, 2004; published on-line as D-2004-0922-02N,

During the winters of 2002 and 2003, a wilt occurred in melons cultivated
on 1500 ha in Colima State, Mexico. Yield losses reached 25 percent of
final production, despite soil disinfestation with 60 percent methyl
bromide and 40 percent chloropicrin. On the basis of the observation of
plants with necrotic xylem, yellowing, and wilting of leaves, this disease
was identified provisionally as Fusarium wilt.
During February 2003, 4 soil samples from affected fields were plated onto
a Fusarium-selective medium (1), which resulted in the detection of 2260 �
357, 179 � 76, 668 � 357, and 1391 � 256 CFU/g of _F. oxysporum_ (3). 31
randomly chosen isolates were used to inoculate differential cultivars of
melon as described by Risser et al. (4). The cultivars were Amarillo
Canario (susceptible to all races), Diana (resistant to races 0 and 2),
Tango (resistant to races 0 and 1), and Vulcano (resistant to races 0, 1,
and 2) (2).
10 plants of each cultivar, grown on sterilized vermiculite, were
inoculated at the 1st true-leaf stage by drenching with 200 ml of a
conidial suspension (100 000 CFU/ml) of each isolate. Noninoculated plants
of each cultivar served as controls. Plants were maintained in a growth
chamber with a 16-h photoperiod (18 �1000 lux) and temperatures at 23 to
25 deg C.
Yellowing, wilt, and vascular discoloration symptoms developed on cvs.
Amarillo Canario and Diana following inoculation with each of the 31
isolates, while noninoculated plants remained symptomless. _F. oxysporum_
was consistently reisolated on potato dextrose agar from the affected
plants. On the basis of the combination of affected cultivars, all isolates
were identified as _F. oxysporum_ f. sp. _melonis_ race 1.
To our knowledge, this is the 1st report of _F. oxysporum_ f. sp. _melonis_
race 1 in Colima State, Mexico.

[_F. oxysporum_ f. sp. _melonis_ (Fom) causes a severe disease of melon
(muskmelon and canteloupe) in many parts of the world. There are 4 races,
0, 1, 2 and 1,2. Disease management is predicated on the use of resistant
cultivars, which in turn depends on fungal populations in the soil and the
races present. Movement of farm equipment from Fom-infested fields to clean
fields is to be avoided because chlamydospores remain viable for years. In
addition Fom can be spread on tools, feet and in surface water contaminated
with infested soil. Deposition of compost on clean fields is to be avoided
since it contains Fom. Crop rotation can be helpful in lowering the amount
of Fusarium in the soil, as part of an integrated management program using
resistant varieties. It is important to rotate to unsusceptible plant
species, such as grasses or cereals.
I am puzzled by the emphasis on race 1. What is the effect of this race on
melon compared to races 0, 2 and 1,2? Perhaps our readers can enlighten me
on this point.
