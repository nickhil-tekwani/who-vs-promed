Police in Zimbabwe have arrested 3 elephant poachers and recovered 6 kg [approx 13.3 Lb] of cyanide concentrate that the suspects intended to use to poison waterholes in the Chishakwe Conservancy, Hwange and Mana Pools National Parks.

Suspected poacher I.N. was apprehended by villagers in the Gwayi area near Hwange National Park, leading to the recovery of 4 kg [approx 8.8 Lb] of raw ivory and 3 kg [approx 6.6 Lb] of cyanide concentrate in powder form.

Parks and Wildlife Management Authority spokesperson Caroline-Washaya Moyo said I.N., who appeared in court in Hwange on [Mon 19 Dec 2016], was sentenced to 9 years in jail for the illegal possession of elephant tusks. Police are still looking for his accomplice who escaped arrest.

Washaya Moyo said a joint anti-poaching unit comprising police and game rangers apprehended M.C. in Masvingo and recovered 2 kg [approx. 4.4 Lb] of cyanide concentrate. M.C. was arrested while allegedly on a poaching mission in the Chishakwe Conservancy in the same province.

In Guruve, P.K. was sentenced to 12 months in prison after pleading guilty to the illegal possession of 500 g [approx 1 Lb] of cyanide concentrate. The convict was apprehended by a patrol team in Mana Pools.

In 2013, more than 300 elephants were killed by poachers using cyanide poisoning in Hwange National Park. Since then, the use of cyanide poison to lace waterholes to kill elephants has spread across the country with devastating consequences in Gonarezhou, Chizarira, Matusadona, Zambezi and Matetsi National Parks. Cyanide poisoning, now the preferred method of elephant poaching because of its "silent killing" capabilities, has also spread to areas outside designated national parks.

Apart from elephants, the indiscriminate use of the cyanide poison has also killed a variety of other animals including vultures, lions and jackals.

[The use of cyanide to kill elephants, rhinos, lions, vultures, jackals and other animals is a dreadful crime deserving of punishment. Cyanide in water poisons other animals in addition to ivory producing animals (elephants and rhinos). These people are poachers who use lethal means to rob the animals' horn or tusks and take their life. In doing so, they also rob the ecosystem and tourists of many species of magnificent animals.

Cyanide can come either as a gas, as in hydrogen cyanide, or as a solid; in the form of potassium cyanide and/or sodium cyanide. As a solid crystalline form, it can be put out as some kind of bait for the elephants. Once cyanide is in the system, the cells are unable to use oxygen, because cellular respiration is blocked through the inhibition of the cytochrome oxidase system and its' enzyme.

If cyanide was put out as crystalline bait, then the perpetrators might have expected crystalline cyanide salts to work faster because of the acid in the stomach. These animals would likely have had difficulty breathing, perhaps causing panic, and then cardiac arrest. This would have been a painful death for these elephants.

Elephants are exceptionally intelligent, family oriented animals. They are very human-like in their emotions and thinking processes. The poachers are likely to have been shrewd observers of animal behavior. And, this is truly a heinous crime.

Elephants need a relatively large amount of sodium in their diet. The Journal of Mammalogy indicates that they tend to be somewhat deficient in sodium. As a consequence, they tend to seek out salty soil and consume it. Many elephant and mammal salt licks are areas within the ground that are high in sodium. An early salt lick may be seen at http://www.lastrefuge.co.uk/php/show-images-all-big.php?id=AW03538. However, these salt licks do not remain flat. After a time, they resemble a hole which can hold water, as seen at http://origin-ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0169555X1100314X-gr2.jpg.

According to Holdo RM, Dudley JP, and McDowell LR (Geophagy in the African elephant in relation to availability of dietary sodium. Journal of Mammalogy 2002; 83(3): 652-64, http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.1644/1545-1542(2002)083%3C0652%3AGITAEI%3E2.0.CO%3B2):

"We studied the use of mineral licks by African elephants (_Loxodonta africana_) during the dry season in a Kalahari-sand habitat in Hwange National Park, Zimbabwe, to investigate the role of geophagy as a mechanism for supplementing low Na+ [sodium] levels in browse and natural water supplies. Plant, water, and soil macrominerals were measured to evaluate mineral availability for elephants during the dry season. Elephant behavior was monitored at licks to investigate the intensity of geophagy (measured by number of mouthfuls of soil consumed) in relation to fecal-[sodium] loss. Female elephants, which probably had greater requirements than did males because of pregnancy and lactation, consumed more mouthfuls of soil and spent a greater part of their activity budget feeding on soil than did males, suggesting that geophagy may be driven by a nutritional requirement. We found the following consistent with the [sodium]-supplementation hypothesis: 1) unlike other minerals, [sodium] in woody plants and natural water supplies may be inadequate to meet the minimum requirements of elephants during the dry season; 2) soils consumed by elephants differed from other soils primarily in their high [sodium] content; 3) intensity of geophagy was negatively correlated with fecal [sodium]; and 4) elephants in non-Kalahari-sand habitats do not appear to create or use licks, probably because they are able to meet their [sodium] requirements from ubiquitous [sodium]-rich water supplies, which do not occur naturally in Kalahari-sand habitats."

But according to Young CA and Jordan TS (Cyanide remediation: current and past technologies. Proc. 10th Annual Conf. on Hazardous Waste Research, Kansas State University 1995, http://www.dtsc.ca.gov/HazardousWaste/Cyanide/upload/CN_remediation_young.pdf, page 109):

"Soils, wastes and ores containing minerals such as ilmenite (FeTiO3), hematite (Fe2O3), bauxite [AlO.OH/Al(OH)3], and pyrite (FeS2), as well as mineral-groups such as feldspars, zeolites, and clays have been shown to effectively adsorb free and metal-complexed cyanides. Depending on the mineral, cyanide adsorption is usually a combination of 2 mechanisms: ion exchange, precipitation or coulomb interaction. Cyanide attenuation by such mineral commodities purifies ground and surface waters but increases cyanide consumption in leaching operations."

"With bowl-like areas holding water, a number of things may be in play to neutralize the stable sodium cyanide or even potassium cyanide. It is possible that the cyanide salt may be bound or neutralized by the calcrete clays that are the dominant constituent of the soil matrix around these natural salt licks in Hwange's Kalahari Sands habitats. However, if that were the case, we should be seeing fewer deaths than have occurred. The rainy season should be upon these areas soon and may help dilute the water holes where these very stable cyanide salts are.

"While some substances may bind the cyanide salts, they could be detoxified by acidifying the soil or the water. However, this is a very dangerous situation, as when the acid is applied to the cyanide salts, they release the cyanide as gas, and such gas escaping in a cloud from one of these salt holes or licks may be enough to kill the person unless they have protective gear such as respirators and suits. This would also be a labor intensive and expensive method, but it could be done."

Additional information is available from Young and Jordan's document.

Perhaps if lucky, at least some of the cyanide in the salt licks will be found and neutralized by the calcrete clays, which are the dominant constituent of the soil matrix of the natural salt licks in Hwange's Kalahari Sands habitats. - Mod.TG
