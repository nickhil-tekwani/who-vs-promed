STAR FISH, DIE OFF? - USA (ATLANTIC COAST): REQUEST FOR INFO

I was curious as to whether anyone is aware of an epidemic/die-off among
various species of _Echinaster_ (star fishes) off the Florida Gulf and
Atlantic coasts and possibly all the way up the eastern seaboard?
Friends have been asking me about this as I do a lot of diving in the
summer, usually offshore (and have noticed nothing unusual). Most of the
sick and dying star fish are being found in shallow water near shore. They
are frequently covered with pustules, tips of their legs rotting away and
tend to die quickly after the pustules have covered the entire body. Those
who asked me about this problem say that they have noticed this problem for
several years. Additionally, I heard third hand that some species of
_Vibrio_ was being discussed as a possible culprit among marine biology
circles.
