Strangles scare hits carnival
-----------------------------
The scratching of 2 horses at Saturday's [19 Sep 2009] Hawke's Bay
Spring Carnival race meeting in Hastings sent up an "absolute red
flag" that the highly infectious equine respiratory disease
strangles, is here. That's the word from Hawke's Bay Racing CEO Jason
Fleming, who said: "The measures taken and applied are to give enough
comfort to everyone concerned that horses will not be carriers of the
disease."

Molly O'Reilly and Our Dan were withdrawn from the [NZD] 220 000
[approx. USD 160 000] Windsor Park Plate, much to the ire of [a
Hawke's Bay Racing committee member who part-owns and trains both
horses, and] had been operating under close observation after a
neighboring property owner discovered a horse with strangles 3 weeks
ago.

At the weekend [the trainer] said New Zealand Thoroughbred Racing
(NZTR) officials had assured him he would be free to operate provided
he met the necessary guidelines. But NZTR veterinary adviser Andrew
Grierson yesterday [21 Sep 2009] said: "There was no way it could
have been risked.

"[The trainer's] quote in a Sunday [20 Sep 2009] newspaper that his
horses were fine because they hadn't shown an elevated temperature
and that horses are only infectious when they had a fever is,
essentially, not correct. In fact, it's never been conclusively
proved when horses are contagious with strangles." Mr Grierson said
several irate trainers had expressed nervousness on Saturday morning
[19 Sep 2009] before the scratchings.

The disease affects a horse's lymph nodes, leading to high body
temperatures and mucus discharge from the nose. The disease spreads
when horses and jockeys come into contact with the discharge. If
Molly O'Reilly and Our Dan had raced and later tested positive for
strangles, Australian racing and border control authorities would
prevent any of the horses that raced in Hastings from entering
Australia for the Melbourne spring carnival.

Mr Fleming said the issues surrounding the disease were subjective
with differing opinions over how it spread. Suspected horses had been
isolated at the Cottle property. "It's not an issue that's new to
racing ... With the right application we can contain it." Mr Fleming
said it was vital some horses be barred from competing in the [NZD]
1.2 million [approx. USD 870 000] Kelt Capital Stakes in Hastings on
3 Oct 2009, to ensure the best horses continued to enter the region's
elite meetings. "The stipendiary stewards have taken a step further
because it's not a notifiable disease," Mr Fleming said. "We're doing
what's best for the safety of the horses."

[Strangles is an infectious, contagious disease of Equidae
characterized by abscesses in the lymphoid tissue of the upper
respiratory tract. The causative organism, _Streptococcus equi equi_,
is highly host-adapted and produces clinical disease only in horses,
donkeys, and mules. It is a gram-positive, capsulated-hemolytic
Lancefield group C coccus, which is an obligate parasite and a
primary pathogen.

_S. equi equi_ is highly contagious, and produces high morbidity and
low mortality in susceptible populations. Transmission occurs via
fomites and direct contact with infectious exudates. Carrier animals
are important for maintenance of the bacteria between epizootics and
initiation of outbreaks on premises previously free of disease.
Survival of the organism in the environment is dependent on
temperature and humidity; it is susceptible to desiccation, extreme
heat, and exposure to sunlight, and must be protected within mucoid
secretions to survive. Under ideal environmental circumstances, the
organism can survive 7-9 weeks outside the host. Paddocks and barn
facilities used by infected horses should be regarded as contaminated
for about 2 months after resolution of an outbreak.

The incubation period of strangles is 3-14 days and the 1st sign of
infection is fever (103-106 deg F [39.4-41.1 deg C]). Within 24-48
hours of the initial fever spike, the horse will exhibit signs
typical of strangles, including mucoid to mucopurulent nasal
discharge, depression, and submandibular lymphadenopathy. Horses with
retropharyngeal lymph node involvement will have difficulty
swallowing, inspiratory respiratory noise (compression of the dorsal
pharyngeal wall), and extended head and neck. Older animals with
residual immunity may develop an atypical or catarrhal form of the
disease with mucoid nasal discharge, cough, and mild fever.
Metastatic strangles ("bastard strangles") is characterized by
abscesses in other lymph nodes of the body, particularly in the
abdomen and, less frequently, the thorax.

The environment for clinically ill horses should be warm, dry, and
dust-free. Warm compresses are applied to sites of lymphadenopathy to
facilitate maturation of abscesses. Facilitated drainage of mature
abscesses will speed recovery. Ruptured abscesses should be flushed
with dilute (3-5 percent) povidone-iodine solution for several days
until discharge ceases. NSAID [non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs]
can be administered judiciously to reduce pain and fever and improve
appetite in horses with fulminant clinical disease.

Antimicrobial therapy is controversial. Most authors agree that
initiation of antibiotic therapy after abscess formation may provide
temporary clinical improvement in fever and depression, but
ultimately prolongs the course of disease by delaying maturation of
abscesses. Antibiotic therapy is indicated in cases with dyspnea,
dysphagia, prolonged high fever, and severe lethargy/anorexia [loss
of appetite]. Administration of penicillin during the early stage of
infection (up to 24 hr after onset of fever) will usually abort
abscess formation. The disadvantage of early antimicrobial treatment
is failure to mount a protective immune response, rendering horses
highly susceptible to infection after cessation of therapy. If
antimicrobial therapy is indicated, procaine penicillin (22 000
IU/kg, intramuscular injection, twice a day) is the antibiotic of
choice.

The affected horses are quite uncomfortable. Sharing of halters and
brushes that may contact the fluid from draining abscesses can spread
the disease to other horses.
