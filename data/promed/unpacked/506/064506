More bird flu outbreaks in Viet Nam
----------------------------------
Bird flu is suspected of spreading to an 8th province in Viet Nam, but
officials have insisted fresh outbreaks of the disease were under control.
Veterinary officials in the southern coastal province of Ba Ria-Vung Tau
said hundreds of chickens and ducks had died since 6 Jul 2004, particularly
in and around the town of Vung Tau.
Blood samples from the dead poultry were sent last week [1st week July
2004] to the southern regional veterinary department in Ho Chi Minh City to
test for the presence of the lethal H5N1 strain of bird flu. The results
are yet to be released.
If presence of the virus is confirmed, Ba Ria-Vung Tau would be the 8th
province to be affected by bird flu after the government's highly
criticized 30 Mar 2004 declaration that the country was free of the disease.
The announcement, which came just 15 days after the disease claimed its
16th fatality, prompted charges from international disease control experts
that Hanoi was acting prematurely and recklessly.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that it could take years to
eliminate the virus from the environment.
New outbreaks have also been reported in the southern Mekong Delta province
of Tra Vinh, one of the 7 provinces confirmed by the government to be
facing a recurrence of the disease. Local veterinary officials said
thousands of quail had died since the end of June 2004, with the Cang Long
district among the worst affected.
3 districts in Can Tho province, also in the Delta region, are also
tackling fresh outbreaks.
Provincial authorities have ordered the setting up of isolation zones
around the areas of infection, the state-run Quan Doi Nhan Dan newspaper
reported.
According to the latest report from the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural
Development, more than 35 000 chickens and ducks, and 13 000 quail, have
been infected, culled, or have died as a result of the virus since April
2004. However, ministry spokesman Bui Quang Anh insisted the situation was
under control. "Viet Nam is able to control the return of the bird flu
epidemic," he told the Tuoi Tre newspaper.
Besides Viet Nam, Thailand and China have also reported fresh outbreaks in
recent weeks.

[2] H5N1, Thailand

Health authorities said Thursday that avian flu had been detected in
chickens and ducks in Thailand's capital, bringing the number of provinces
affected to 10 -- out of 76 -- and raising fears of a new human epidemic
like the one that killed 24 people earlier this year.
Outbreaks also have been reported in China and Vietnam. 2 scientific papers
published in the last week hinted that the virus was more easily infecting
mammals, presumably including humans, and authorities fear that another
mutation or two will allow it to spread readily from human to human.
More than 40 000 chickens have been killed in Thailand to halt the spread
of the disease. Deputy Prime Minister Chaturon Chaisang said chickens and
ducks on farms throughout the country would be randomly tested for the
virus [prior to?]
31 Jul 2004.
Authorities have already ordered immediate culling on any farm where more
than 10 percent of the chickens have died of unidentified causes.
Farmers this week have called for the use of a vaccine that offers chickens
some protection against the virus, but Chaturon said the government would
not permit its use until more was known about its safety and effectiveness.
Some scientists fear that the vaccine, which does not completely block
infection, could lead to mutations that would increase the risk to humans.
Chinese authorities have been monitoring 37 people for avian flu symptoms
after finding the disease on a poultry farm this week, according to a
report in the state-run China Youth Daily. So far there have been no
reports of human infection in Thailand amid the current outbreak.
Thailand has historically been one of the largest exporters of chicken in
Southeast Asia. About 100 million chickens and ducks were culled in the flu
outbreak earlier this year, devastating the poultry industry. 8 people died
in Thailand and 16 in Vietnam in the outbreak.
Farmers and government officials eradicated the outbreak in commercial
flocks but have been unable to halt its spread in wild fowl, which are
thought to be the major reservoir of infection.
Microbiologist Yi Guan of the University of Hong Kong and his colleagues
reported last week in the online version of the journal Nature that the
virus responsible for the current outbreak developed in domestic ducks in
the southern provinces of China and spread throughout the region via wild
ducks and other fowl.
Over the course of 5 years, they concluded, the virus has evolved so that
it thrives much better in domestic fowl.
Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra this week blamed wild open-billed
storks for the current outbreak. Chaturon, however, said the storks would
not be indiscriminately killed.
"Random checks found the virus in some storks, but we will not seek to kill
them en masse," he said. "We will only cull the ones that are found with
the virus and dispose of the dead birds properly." [Are the storks to
be randomly tested without being killed?! - Mod. AS].
Robert G. Webster of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis,
Tenn., has studied samples of the virus collected each year since 1998 and
reported last week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences
that the viruses collected most recently could infect mice more easily and
were deadlier than those collected earlier. That suggests that the virus is
accumulating mutations that will allow it to infect humans more readily, he
said.
Currently, the virus appears to be a threat only to people who come in
direct contact with infected birds or their feces. The virus has not been
shown to be transmitted from person to person.

Surge in bird-flu outbreaks
---------------------
Thailand today revealed a sharp increase in outbreaks of a lethal strain of
bird flu and confirmed it had reached the capital Bangkok.
Agriculture officials revealed that 6 more provinces had been affected,
taking the total to 15, amid fears of a resurgence of the crisis that left
24 people dead across Asia earlier this year.
Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra sought to play down the crisis,
saying outbreaks were appearing only sporadically across the country's 76
provinces.
He said the Government ordered prompt culls when suspected cases were
identified, but ruled out any vaccination program because of fears the
virus could mutate.
Updated figures from the Livestock Development Department showed that
confirmed cases had been reported in 77 districts within 15 provinces.
Most of the new confirmed cases were in central and northern areas of the
country.
Meanwhile, the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) urged countries in
Asia not to cull wild animals since they were not a major factor in the
resurgence of the disease.
Mr Thaksin last week ordered the killing of all storks that he believed
were behind the latest bird flu outbreaks.
"Killing wild birds will not help to prevent avian influenza outbreaks. To
date, there is no scientific evidence that wildlife is the major factor in
resurgence of the disease in the region," Juan Lubroth, of the FAO Animal
Health Service, said.

[4] Indonesia: mass vaccination proposed

IPB, Japan to produce bird flu super vaccine
--------------------------------------------
The Veterinary School of the Bogor Institute of Agriculture (IPB), and the
institute's firm, PT Bogor Life Science and Technology, have cooperated
with Japan's Shigeta Animal Pharmaceuticals Inc. to develop a new vaccine
to prevent the deadly bird flu.
Shigeta director Yoshiyuki Nishio, and PT Bogor Life director Thamrin
Poeloengan, signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) on Wed 14 Jul 2004.
The team will work on an avian flu recombinant vaccine, which is claimed to
be a modification of the existing vaccines currently used widely to deal
with outbreaks of the H5N1 bird flu virus that ravaged Asian flocks since
early 2004.
Many experts said the existing vaccines could not prevent humans from being
infected by the virus.
PT Bogor Life operational director Kamaluddin Zarkasie said that, to work
effectively, the new vaccine was the molecular modification of an organism
that has high endurance. "Moreover, the vaccine is made from an inactive
virus, so that it will be much safer than the existing one, which uses live
viruses," he said, after the signing at the Veterinary School Hall. [Though
this might be interpreted as a live-attenuated vaccine, Zarkasie probably
refers here to the use of a live virus during the 1st stages of the
production of existing inactivated vaccines. ProMED-mail has, in the past,
mentioned rumors of the use of live AI vaccines in East Asia, but, no
confirmation could be obtained. - Mod.AS]. "We need the vaccine, because
Indonesia has many poultry farms, with about 1 billion fowl," he added.
Although no cases in humans have been found in Indonesia, 7.4 million
chickens, ducks, geese, pigeons, and other birds were estimated to have
died from the disease, and thousands of others culled to prevent the virus
from spreading.
Ironically, as the central government, and the United Nations Food and
Agriculture Organization (FAO) have revealed, bird flu could have been
brought into the country via illegal vaccines, possibly from China, Mexico
or Italy. Human error is presumed to have resulted in the presence of whole
live viruses in the illegal [allegedly inactivated] vaccines.
FAO also suspected the virus was brought in through illegally imported
livestock, and livestock products, which are widespread in Indonesia.
According to Kamaluddin, the team will produce 300 million dosages of the
vaccine. "The 1st round of production will be carried out by Shigeta, which
has the infrastructure. We shall produce it ourselves after we have all the
facilities, maybe next year," he explained. In the future, he added, PT
Bogor Life would have the right to sell the vaccine to other neighboring
countries vulnerable to the disease, including Malaysia, Myanmar, Thailand,
the Philippines, and Viet Nam.

[The information supplied by Shigeta, and PT Bogor Life, on other vaccines,
allegedly in use, deserve attention. They say that the FAO has revealed
that bird flu could have been brought into Indonesia via illegal (killed)
vaccines, which might have included whole live viruses. If true, and
provided a classical stamping-out policy is not applicable under
the prevailing Indonesian conditions, then "Targeted and strictly
monitored vaccination, using a quality-assured, vaccine remains a
complementary option" (as indicated by the FAO; see 20040715.1917).
However, general, mass vaccination of the national poultry population is
another story. It will be interesting to note the opinion on such a
strategy by the advisory expert panels of the relevant international
organizations. It will also be of importance to note whether the
vaccination plan, presented by the 2 institutions above, is acceptable, or,
has been endorsed by the Indonesian authorities.
The pros and cons of various vaccination policies have been discussed in a
paper by Capua and Marangon (see ref 20040325.0829).
In a recent paper -- by Lee et al, Effect of Vaccine Use in the Evolution
of Mexican-Lineage H5N2 Avian Influenza Virus (to be published in the
Journal of Virology on 1 Aug 2004) -- experience and observations gathered
during 8 years have been discussed. Examination of the commercial vaccine
and viruses isolated from Mexico over the past 8 years showed the same
types of changes that were observed in humans. It has been demonstrated
that veterinary influenza vaccines, like human vaccines, should
be reconsidered yearly for updates to achieve optimal protection, since
antigenic drift may take place. - Mod.AS].
