"Swine flu in the world, ticks in Turkey," read the headline of the daily's
top story yesterday [26 May 2009], reporting that while New York was shaken
by its 2nd death caused by swine flu, Turkey lost 5 people to Crimean-Congo
hemorrhagic fever (CCHF), caused by a virus transmitted by ticks, over the
past 4 days.

With the warming temperatures, CCHF cases have returned to Turkey. Two
people died from CCHF on Monday [25 May 2009], bringing the number of CCHF
victims in the past 4 days to 5. About 70 people lost their lives to CCHF
in Turkey last summer [2008]. The number of people who have died as a
result of swine flu around the world this year [2009] has increased to 91.
The 2nd death caused by swine flu in New York has led authorities to close
schools and caused cancellations of hotel reservations, the daily reported.

[This brief report indicates that there have been 5 deaths in Turkey within
the past 4 days as a result of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus
infection. These deaths are presumed to be additional to the 4 deaths
reported previously in Today's Zaman newspaper (see the preceding
ProMED-mail post), but this is not certain, as the provinces where the
deaths occurred are not identified. Undoubtedly, the number of cases will
increase as the tick vector becomes more abundant as the temperature rises.
