Local tests have confirmed that an Indonesian child from the city of
Bandung died of avian influenza, a senior health ministry official said on
Thu 25 May 2006. Local results on bird flu cases are not considered
definitive and need confirmation from the World Health Organisation.
I Nyoman Kandun, Director-general of Communicable Disease Control, told
Reuters that local tests have found one of 2 siblings admitted to hospital
earlier this week in the West Java capital of Bandung was a positive H5N1
case. "The younger one is positive. We are looking into the other one," he
said. The younger sibling, a 10-year-old girl, died on Tue 23 May 2006.
World attention is now focused on another Indonesian family after the WHO
confirmed 7 members from Kubu Simbelang village in North Sumatra province
were infected with the H5N1 avian influenza virus. It is the largest known
bird flu cluster since the disease re-appeared in Asia in 2003 and the WHO
says limited human-to-human contact between family members might have occurred.
International and local health officials say there is no evidence the virus
had mutated in the Kubu Simbelang cluster case. But the case has baffled
experts because no definitive source of infection has been found. H5N1
remains difficult for humans to catch, but experts fear it could evolve
into a form passes easily from human to human, causing a pandemic that
could kill millions.

For the first time, evidence suggests that the H5N1 avian influenza virus
may have passed from one person to another and on to a 3rd, according to a
World Health Organization (WHO) official. Referring to the extended-family
case cluster in Indonesia, the WHO's Maria Cheng told the Canadian Press
(CP) yesterday, "This is the first time we have seen cases that have gone
beyond one generation of human-to-human spread."
The WHO said in an online statement yesterday that analysis of viruses from
patients in the cluster had shown no evidence of changes that could lead to
efficient human-to-human transmission. But another WHO official expressed
serious concern about the cluster. Peter Cordingley, spokesman for the
WHO's Western Pacific region, quoted in a Reuters report today, said, "This
is the most significant development so far in terms of public health. We
have never had a cluster as large as this. We have not had in the past what
we have here, which is no explanation as to how these people became
infected [in the first place]. We can't find sick animals in this
community, and that worries us."
In a news briefing this afternoon [24 May 2006], the Director of the US
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) generally echoed the WHO's
message of yesterday that the cluster appears to involve person-to-person
transmission but that there is no sign of transmission beyond the cluster
and no evidence of changes in the virus. "There's a lot more science to be
done, but the early indication is we're not seeing anything that would be
sending up an alarm," Dr. Julie Gerberding said from Geneva, where she is
attending the WHO's annual meeting. She added, "We understand we can't be
complacent about this."
The cluster includes 7 confirmed cases in an extended family, 6 of which
were fatal. All of these followed a similar illness in a 37-year-old woman
who died and was buried without being tested for avian flu. The WHO regards
her illness as the index case. Although other officials have said
investigators have not been able to find a possible animal source for the
index patient's infection, Gerberding said today, "Clearly the source of
infection likely was an infected poultry exposure." Concurring with the
view that at least two generations of transmission occurred, she added,
"The person who initially got the infection from poultry may have been the
source of transmission to other family members, and there may have been
subsequent transmission to other family members." She said the family
members had close contact with one another, and there have been no
infections in healthcare workers or others outside the family.
Gerberding said that a 2-generation, or "person-to-person-to-person,"
transmission chain is significant in that it raises the "worrisome
possibility" of a change in the virus, but added that investigators have
not found evidence of a change.
She also said the cluster is not the first example of probable
person-to-person transmission of the virus. "This probably the 3rd example
where we've seen pretty good evidence of human-to-human transmission," she
told reporters. Gerberding described the people in the cluster as "all
related by blood," implying the possibility of genetic susceptibility to
the virus. She said it is possible there are some people "who are more
susceptible to transmission because of the unique makeup of their
respiratory tract. . . . We have no evidence of this, but we have to
examine that hypothesis."
The CDC head said the genetic sequencing of viruses from the cluster so far
has yielded 4 main findings: (1) The isolates are all virtually identical,
implying a single source; (2) they are susceptible to the antiviral drug
Tamiflu (oseltamivir); (3) there is no evidence of motif changes in the
particular areas of the genes that are responsible for how the virus binds
to the respiratory tract of people; and (4) the isolates are very similar
to viruses previously collected from poultry in the region.
Gerberding said the cluster occurred in "a Christian community in a pretty
remote area on an outlying island." Both traditional and western medical
techniques are used in the village. Contrary to some recent reports, she
said the local residents have shown "enormous cooperation" with the WHO
investigators, at least in the past few days.
The Indonesian cluster has triggered talk about the possibility of the
WHO's changing its pandemic alert status from phase 3 to phase 4 on its
6-phase scale, with phase 6 being a full-blown pandemic. A WHO task force
would have to meet and make this decision. "Right now," said the WHO's
Cheng in a Reuters story today, "it does not look like the task force will
need to meet immediately, but this is subject to change, depending on what
comes out of Indonesia." But the WHO's pandemic alert system lacks specific
criteria for elevating the alert level, according to Michael Osterholm,
PhD, MPH, Director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy
(CIDRAP) at the University of Minnesota, which publishes the CIDRAP Web
site. "I'm personally confused about the difference in what a phase 3 and
phase 4 alert level is," he said today. "The WHO has not clearly described
the difference. "That's important. I'm personally aware of a number of
companies that have pegged certain levels of their pandemic flu plan based
on a change from phase 3 to phase 4. And I'm not sure a change in the alert
level would warrant a change in pandemic planning."
The WHO Global Influenza Preparedness Plan (see WHO Global Influenza
Preparedness Plan defines phase 3 as "human infection(s) with a new
subtype, but no human-to-human spread, or at most rare instances of spread
to a close contact." Phase 4 is characterized by "small cluster(s) with
limited human-to-human transmission, but spread is highly localized,
suggesting that the virus is not well adapted to humans." The WHO plan
further states, "The distinction between phase 3, phase 4, and phase 5 is
based on an assessment of the risk of a pandemic. Factors may include rate
of transmission, geographical location and spread, severity of illness,
presence of genes from human strains (if derived from an animal strain),
and/or other scientific parameters."

The first person infected in a cluster of bird flu cases in a family in
Indonesia may have come into contact with sick or dead chickens before
possibly passing the virus on to relatives, a World Health Organization
official said Thu [25 May 2006]. At least 6 people have died and one other
was sickened in the largest of 4 such clusters to date in which the virus
has infected multiple members of the same family. "We believe she may have
had some contact either with dead or dying chickens in her household or
through her activities as a vegetable grower and a seller in a market,"
said Steven Bjorge, a WHO epidemiologist in Jakarta.
The WHO has said it is possible the disease may have spread through limited
human-to-human transmission in the latest cluster of cases, but it doesn't
appear to have spread outside the family. Earlier, health officials said
they had no evidence anyone in the cluster had contact with poultry
infected with the H5N1 bird flu virus. Tests on birds in the village of
Kubu Sembelang, where the family lives, all came back negative.
Global and U.S. health officials say samples taken from family members do
not indicate the virus has mutated. Experts are closely monitoring the H5N1
virus because they fear a genetic change could enable it to spread easily
from person to person, possibly sparking a pandemic. So far, most human
cases have been traced to direct contact with infected birds. Bjorge said
the family members were in close physical proximity while they were sick,
including sleeping near one another. He said there is no reason for alarm
because rare cases of human-to-human transmission have been observed
previously. "Even though so many people were tragically affected in this
case, it hasn't really changed the picture of avian influenza in Indonesia
at this time," he said.
Bjorge said a team of international health experts and local villagers
themselves are closely monitoring the area in northern Sumatra to ensure no
one else experiences flu-like symptoms. "We want to find out if there is
any possibility of even one person having mild symptoms that might have
been overlooked," Bjorge said. "We are very concerned about this large
outbreak and we've taken it very seriously as has the government." Local
authorities have resisted working with outside health experts and many
villagers blame black magic, not avian influenza, for the deaths of the
family members.
Although other cases of limited human-to-human transmission have been
documented -- including a mother and child in Thailand -- this may be the
first time bird flu has been passed among multiple individuals, Dr. Julie
Gerberding, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, said Wednesday.
Bird flu has killed 124 people worldwide, more than a quarter of them in
Indonesia. It remains unclear exactly how the virus spreads among family
members -- whether it is through respiration, food, contact with infected
surfaces or a combination of these vectors, said WHO spokesman Gregory
Hartl in Geneva. Other experts have suggested certain family members could
have a genetic weakness to the disease. In all, 4 family clusters have been
recorded so far, and only direct blood relatives -- not spouses -- have
contracted the disease.
The WHO said it will leave its pandemic alert level unchanged at 3, where
it has been for months, meaning there is "no or very limited human-to-human
transmission." In the latest family cluster, the first woman to die was
buried before samples could be collected, but she was considered to be
among those infected with bird flu.

A man died of bird flu this week in the arms of his wife in the back of a
jeep as he was taken to the hospital. For 3 days he had evaded doctors
seeking to test him for the virus that killed him and at least 6 of his
Indonesian relatives, including his son.
The movements of the now-deceased man, a thin, boyish-looking 32-year-old
who grew limes, chilies and tomatoes in a northern mountain village of the
Indonesian island of Sumatra, are part of a health probe that's attracting
international attention. He and his relatives -- a brother, 2 sisters, 2
nephews, a niece and his son -- represent the largest reported instance in
which avian flu may have been spread among people, investigators say.
The World Health Organization says the Sumatran incident may mean the H5N1
avian influenza strain is becoming more adept at infecting humans, not just
birds. Scientists are monitoring outbreaks like the one in Sumatra for
signs the virus is evolving into a form capable of killing millions.
"It's a good example of what the beginning of a pandemic outbreak might
look like," said Ira Longini, a biostatistician at the University of
Washington in Seattle. "You would expect familial or hospital-based
outbreaks and clusters." The WHO's disease-trackers are especially
interested in the whereabouts of the man described above before he died to
determine whom he risked infecting. He may have caught the virus from his
son, who probably was infected by an aunt. This would be the first evidence
of a 3-person chain of infection, said WHO spokeswoman Maria Cheng in a
telephone interview.
Cheng said investigators have yet to identify an infected animal as a
source of the outbreak. While that's not uncommon, direct contact with sick
or dead birds is the principal cause of the human H5N1 infections confirmed
by the WHO since late 2003.
To date, the virus has sickened 218 people in 10 countries, killing 124 of
them, the WHO said on May 23. Only a few cases may have been caused by
exposure to other infected individuals. Health officials' difficulty
tracking down the ill man for the 3 days leading to his death suggests that
Indonesia may have trouble containing a human outbreak that might jump from
affected villages to the rest of Southeast Asia.
A pandemic starts when a novel influenza A-type virus, to which almost no
one has natural immunity, emerges and begins spreading across the world.
Experts believe that the 1918 pandemic, which killed 50 million people,
began when a lethal avian flu virus jumped directly to people from birds. A
similar outbreak may take more than 142 million lives and cause the world's
economy to shrink by an 8th, a February report by the Lowy Institute and
Australian National University found.
The chances of one emerging in Indonesia are higher because the Southeast
Asian nation of about 240 million people has 30 million villages with more
than 200 million chickens in backyards, according to the UN's Food and
Agriculture Organization. "Indonesia is a very challenging situation," said
William Hueston, Director of the Center for Animal Health and Food Safety
at the University of Minnesota in St. Paul. It's a "huge country with a lot
of different geographical units, and many working independently as I
understand it."
The Sumatra cases are being traced back to the man's 37-year- old sister,
who worked selling limes at the Tiga Panah market about 5 kilometers (3
miles) from her home in Kubu Sembelang. She developed symptoms on 27 Apr
and died of respiratory disease on 4 May 2006, according to the WHO. No
specimens were obtained before her burial, and the cause of her death can't
be confirmed, the agency said in a 18 May statement. It's possible the
woman became infected from an animal source, said WHO's Cheng in a May 24
phone interview. The investigators comprise local health officials
supported by 5 international experts, led by Tom Grein, a senior WHO
epidemiologist based in Geneva.
A preliminary investigation indicates that 3 of the infected family members
-- the 37-year-old woman's 2 sons and another brother -- spent the night of
29 Apr in a small room when the woman was coughing frequently, the WHO said
in a 23 May statement. Other infected family members lived in adjacent
homes. All the confirmed cases can be directly linked to close and
prolonged exposure to a patient during a phase of severe illness, the WHO
said in its statement. It's less clear how the son of the man described
above was infected, Dick Thompson, leader of the WHO's pandemic and
outbreak communications team, said by phone yesterday from the Indonesian
capital, Jakarta. Based on neighbors' accounts, it's possible the boy
entered his aunt's house during her illness, he said.
The man helped care for his 10-year-old son at the Adam Malik Hospital in
Medan up until the boy's death on 13 May, the WHO said. After returning to
his home in Kubu Sembelang 2 days later, the man began coughing. He was
examined 3 days later by local health-care workers, who observed avian
flu-like symptoms. The WHO's Grein recommended on 18 May that he be
isolated and treated in the hospital with the Roche Holding AG antiviral
drug, Tamiflu. Instead the man fled local health authorities and sought
care from a witch doctor, as I Nyoman Kandun, Director general of disease
control with the Indonesian Health Ministry, told reporters in Jakarta on
22 May. Disease trackers located the sick man late on 21 May in a nearby
village. Blood samples and swabs of his nose and throat for viral particles
were taken that day and flown to a laboratory in Jakarta. He died the
following day after tests confirmed he had H5N1, the WHO said on 23 May.
The sick man's actions and the local reaction to the deaths have health
officials worried about how to contain outbreaks should the virus become
contagious among people. Some residents of Kubu Sembelang said they
resented the rapid assessment by some government officials that there was
avian flu in the village. "The Minister of Health said that when the family
got into the hospital they must be infected with bird flu," Veronita, a
food vendor said in an interview on May 17. "The results of the tests
hadn't even been reported. Later the Minister of health changed her words
and said they `probably' have bird flu."
To help instill confidence in the community, "The district leader himself
cut off the head of a chicken and had it cooked to prove that the poultry
here are safe to eat," Veronita said. Dozens of poultry farmers and sellers
from the deceased man's district slaughtered chickens and drank the blood
in Medan on 22 May in a demonstration of their frustration at being branded
by authorities as having been infected with avian flu. Footage of the
protests was broadcast on Trans TV television.
The Sumatra experience shows the government and international health
authorities need to do a better job educating communities and garnering
their trust, said Cheng. The deceased man's wife highlighted the family's
suspicion and lack of understanding when she said in a 17 May interview
that she believed Tamiflu poisoned her son.
The WHO said this month that Tamiflu should be the first choice for doctors
treating people with avian flu. Investigators also are following 33 people
known to have been in contact with infected family members, Cheng said.
Some of the people are taking Tamiflu to prevent the disease, she said. No
other suspected cases had been reported, she said.
