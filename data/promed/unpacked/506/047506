A total of 3 goslings in the Detroit area have tested positive for bird flu and are the 1st confirmed cases of H5N2 avian influenza in the state.

The free-ranging Canada geese goslings were collected last week [week of 1 Jun 2015] in Macomb County's Sterling Heights.

Avian influenza also can infect other free-ranging and domestic poultry such as chickens, turkeys, and quail. Infected birds may show difficulty walking, lack of appetite, and a drop in egg production.

The virus has been found in 20 other states. The US Department of Agriculture says Midwest chicken and turkey producers have lost nearly 47 million birds on over 200 farms since the region's 1st case of H5N2 avian influenza was confirmed on a Minnesota turkey farm in early March [2015].

The risk to people is considered low.

The United States is currently battling what is being described as the worst outbreak of bird flu in the country.

According to Reuters, Michigan yesterday [Mon 8 Jun 2015] reported that Canada geese in the state tested positive for a lethal strain of bird flu, bringing the worst outbreak of the disease in US history to a 21st state. Director of the Michigan Department of Natural Resources, Keith Creagh said the state is now focusing on preventing the spread of the disease to poultry.

Over 46 million chickens and turkeys have been killed across the US by the disease, or culled to prevent spread of the disease.

Michigan is now the 21st state to confirm a case of bird flu since late 2014 and the 6th to detect it only in wild or free-ranging bids. The director of the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, Jamie Clover Adams, said it wasn't unexpected that the disease had been found in the state "given avian influenza has been found in a number of our neighboring states and Ontario."

Iowa agriculture officials are reporting an additional farm infected with bird flu in Sioux County. It's the 18th case in the county and was found in a flock of 3800 birds of various species. An Iowa Department of Agriculture spokesman says he can't be more specific about what type of farm is infected or what species of birds are involved.

It is the 73rd case of bird flu in Iowa. The outbreak has cost the state more than 29 million birds including 24 million egg-laying chickens and 3.8 million pullets, young chickens raised to be egg layers. The state also has lost 1.2 million turkeys.

State officials say all infected turkeys have been removed from barns and 26 million chickens have been humanely euthanized

The cleanup of 46 million birds is mind numbing. It surely takes an emotional as well as a physical toll on the workers tasked with this responsibility. Sadly this "devastation" will be felt at the grocery store for the consumer. After all, if you eat, you are involved in agriculture. Remember even pastries often contain eggs.

Yes, this sad occurrence for some, has proven a boon to those not affected, but ultimately the entire nation suffers from this.

While this virus has not shown any cross-over activity to humans, it is important to remain vigilant. - Mod.TG]
