Sufficient preventive measures had been put in place at a school where
74 students were struck down by a second outbreak of Norwalk virus
within a month, a top health official said yesterday.
Director of Health Dr Margaret Chan Fung Fu-chun said her department
would work with the Education Department to produce a teaching kit for
schools on the effective handling of such infections.
"The virus is by nature very infectious. A single bout of vomiting could
make it spread quickly," she said after accompanying Chief Secretary
Anson Chan Fang On-sang on a visit to Lam Tin Polyclinic.
Between Monday and Wednesday, 74 primary students at the school fell
sick, complaining of vomiting, diarrhoea, stomach pain and fever. Three
were admitted to hospital but later discharged. No new cases were
reported yesterday.
Initial checks confirmed the students had been infected with the Norwalk
virus, Dr Chan said. Norwalk, which struck 28 students at the school
early last month, is common in winter. Children and the elderly are most
vulnerable.
It could be passed easily from one child to another, no matter how quickly
a school reacted, Dr Chan said. "Pupils have close contact with each other.
This will increase the chance of infection, especially during the winter
season," she said. The school has sterilised classrooms and other
facilities.
Dr Chan called for calm over the virus, which lasts for only one to two days
with minor symptoms. As the infections mounted, the school instructed
students feeling sick not to attend.
A total of 104 pupils were absent on Wednesday, although not all of them
because of the illness. The number rose to 149 yesterday, almost one-third
of the total pupils, said school council chairman, the Reverend Michael
Simpson.
He said the school had cleaned up the campus, but might be forced to close
for a few days if a complete clean-up were needed. "The Department of
Health said our action was adequate. We will closely monitor the situation.
"We have to balance the effect - closing the school may panic parents."
