The Texas Department of Health is investigating recent cases of yersiniosis
in 11 babies. They range in age from one to 18 months; eight are less than
seven months old. _Yersinia enterocolitica_ was cultured from the stools of
six babies, three from the Panhandle [northern Texas, where it abuts Oklahoma
and New Mexico -- Mod CHC] and three from the eastern part of the state.
