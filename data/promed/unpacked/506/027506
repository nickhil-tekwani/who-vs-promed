Saskatchewan: First Death Attributable to West Nile Virus Infection
-------------------------------------------------------------------
REGINA: The death of a Saskatchewan man in his 80s has been attributed to
West Nile virus infection, making him the province's first casualty of the
infection and bringing the death toll on the Prairies to 2 [the other
occurred in Manitoba]. The man, who died on Tue 9 Sep 2003 had West Nile
neurologic syndrome, Dr. Brenda Cholin, medical health officer for the
Heartland region, confirmed on Fri 12 Sep 2003. He was one of 6 people with
the condition, said Cholin. The other five were in hospital but all are now
home, she said.
The Heartland region is located in Rosetown, about 100 kilometres southwest
of Saskatoon. On Thu 11 Sep 2003, a 68-year-old diabetic man from Portage
la Prairie, Man., died from West Nile virus infection. Officials said
chronic medical conditions are consistent with other cases of more serious
illness and death associated with West Nile virus.
So far this year, there have been four West Nile virus-related deaths in
Canada. A 92-year-old Ottawa man died last week from pneumonia that was a
complication of his battle with West Nile virus infection. A similar case
occurred in Windsor, Ontario, when a 79-year-old man with symptoms
consistent with West Nile virus infection died in hospital.
Saskatchewan has been hit hardest by West Nile virus infection this year
with 219 confirmed or probable human cases. That's up from 193 on Thu 11
Sep 2003. Five new probable cases of West Nile virus in Toronto were also
reported. By Fri 12 Sep 2003 Toronto now has 13 probable and 2 confirmed
cases of West Nile virus infection this year. Manitoba health officials
also confirmed 7 new probable human West Nile cases in the province on Thu
11 Sep 2003, which brings its total number of probable and confirmed cases
to 18. Conditions that make a person more vulnerable include cancer,
diabetes, heart disease and respiratory problems. Last year, Canada
recorded more than 400 cases of West Nile virus infection, mostly in
southern Ontario. 21 deaths were attributed to the virus, 19 in Ontario
and 2 in Quebec.
