Occurrence of cherry virus A in the UK
--------------------------------------
MJ Kirby, MJ Kirby, AN Adams (<tony.adams@hri.ac.uk>), Horticulture
Research International [HRI], East Malling, Kent, ME19 6BJ. Accepted for
publication 04/06/2001.
Cherry virus A (CVA), a recently described member of the genus
Capillovirus, was first reported in _Prunus cerasus_ [sour cherry]
(Jelkmann, 1995). It is widespread in both Germany and Canada (James and
Jelkmann, 1998; Eastwell and Bernardy, 1998).
In the autumn, leaf and bark material were collected from 16 cherry trees
of different UK origin growing at HRI-East Malling. RNA was extracted from
these samples using a modified protocol based upon the Qiagen RNeasy kit
(MacKenzie et al, 1997). Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction
[RT-PCR] detection of CVA was carried out according to [methods described
by] James and Jelkmann (1998), except that the addition of Extender T PCR
additive (Stratagene) was not necessary for successful amplification using
primer CVA1 (James and Jelkmann, 1998) in combination with a newly designed
primer CVA3.
CVA was found in leaf and bark material taken from 15 of the 16 sweet
cherry trees. This is the first record of (i) the presence of CVA in the UK
and (ii) the ability to detect CVA in dormant material. No data are
available on the impact of CVA on fruit yield from sweet cherry orchards,
yet it appears to be ubiquitous in the UK. CVA is graft transmissible and
the only tree that tested negative for CVA was one grown from seed. CVA may
not cause disease in these trees, but it is possibly deleterious as a
synergist necessary for disease development.
This work provides a starting point for research on the occurrence of the
virus in UK planting material and its possible involvement in the aetiology
of cherry diseases.

[Although first reported in sour cherry (_Prunus cerasus_) CVA was
subsequently found in sweet cherry (_P. avium_). It is transmitted by
grafting and is spreading in the Eurasian region. Other viruses in the
genus _Capillovirus_ are apple stem grooving virus and lilac chlorotic
leafspot virus. In a survey using RT-PCR of samples from cherry trees in
British Columbia, 40% contained CVA and the virus was also detected in
apricot and peach. Although CVA is widespread in Canada (British Columbia)
and Germany, it is not closely related to any of the currently described
diseases in cherry. The sequences of the RNA replicase of British Columbian
isolates are very similar to the German isolate.
