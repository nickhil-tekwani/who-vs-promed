Two cases of endemic typhus (wild animal to human transmission via fleas)
have been confirmed this year in Los Angeles county, California. The cases
came from the same locality, Echo Park. One was a 9-yr-old girl, the other
a 34-yr-old man.
Medical symptoms are fever, headache, muscle ache and rash. Antibiotic
treatment is usually effective. Residents who find rodent infestations have
been asked to call the Vector Management Office (213 881-4046). And all are
advised to keep domestic animals free of fleas.
