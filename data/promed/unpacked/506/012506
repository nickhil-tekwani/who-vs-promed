Treatment of Cape Town CCHF Patient: Request for Information
------------------------------------------------------------
I wonder if the Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) patient in the
Groote Schuur Hospital was treated with ribavirin, and if his clinical
laboratory parameters met the criteria predicting a fatal case based on
Swanepoel's retrospective paper a few years ago?

Failure of Initial RT-PCR Test: Request for Information
-------------------------------------------------------
Is there any explanation why the initial RT-PCR was negative? In those
cases in which I was involved in the United Arab Emirates and Oman, RT-PCR
was a very reliable tool for confirming Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever
(CCHF) virus infection. It is somehow disturbing considering the "alarm
plans" in many countries to hear that RT-PCR failed, since that test is
considered the method of choice for confirmation of a suspected case of
CCHF virus.
