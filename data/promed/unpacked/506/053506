The epidemic of cholera in greater Caracas continues with the confirmation by
health authorities Wednesday of four cases in Catia La Mar on the seacoast
north of Caracas. The Ministry of Health and Social Assistance in Vargas was
aware of three cases in the district of El Piache, and at mid-week, they
confirmed another two cases--one in the prison of La Planta, and another in
the seaside region. Although these cases were thought to have been due to
eating seafood from the beaches of Catia La Mar, Jose Leon Uzcategui
director general of health of the Federal District reported that
epidemiological teams found that the origin of bacteria causing the new
cases of cholera was in oysters acquired in the Coche market in Caracas.
Uzcategui indicated that the current outbreak of cholera that began 6 June
has reached 148 cases with 3 deaths in the metropolitan area. "This figure
includes 60 cases of diarrhea that were found in the prison of La Planta.
Although only 3 cases were confirmed in the laboratory, we have included the
rest in these statistics." The primary focus for health authorities includes
in addition to Coche, Catia La Mar, and the La Planta prison, the area of
Nueva Tacagua. Dr. Uzcategui added that they [the health department] have
pleaded with the management of the principal market of the capital to
undertake health control measures such that food handlers are free of the
vibrio bacteria that can be passed on in food. "If they do not apply
corrective measures, we will be obligated to impose sanctions, that in the
last case could include a complete shutdown of the market."
