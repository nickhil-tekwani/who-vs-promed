One person has succumbed to the dreaded swine flu [influenza pandemic
(H1N1) virus infection], and another is battling for life at the
Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) here.

GMCH Dean S D Dalvi told UNI that a 40-year-old resident of Gangapur
who had tested positive for swine flu died yesterday [23 Jul 2010],
while a 50-year-old hailing from Sillod was in critical condition.
Both tested positive for swine flu by the National Institute of
Virology.

The district was under grip of [influenza pandemic (H1N1) virus
infection] in July and August last year [2009], with more than 100
people losing their lives. However, the intensity of the disease
dimished after February this year [2010], Dr Dalvi said.

Meanwhile, the state health department provided anti-swine flu
vaccines to GMCH and other primary health centers in the entire
district. The vaccines were provided to the doctors treating the swine
flu patients, he added.

As many as 6 players of the Sikkim football team, including East
Bengal midfielder Sanju Pradhan, who happens to be the captain of the
team as well, have been reported to have fallen ill after reaching
Kolkata [Calcutta].

When medical check-ups were conducted, it was confirmed that 3 players
from the squad tested positive for swine flu [influenza pandemic
(H1N1) virus infection].

As swine flu is a contagious disease, the organizers, Indian Football
Association (WB), are scheduled to hold a meeting on Sunday [25 Jul
2010]. It has also been heard that the tournament committee might be
forced to ask Sikkim FA to withdraw their team from the tournament due
to these medical conditions.

Skipper Sanju Pradhan, though not testing positive for swine flu,
remains to be hospitalized. In this situation, the Sikkim team is left
with only 13 fit players to continue in the tournament.

[According to the WHO influenza pandemic (H1N1) update 110 (18 Jul
2010), significant transmission of pandemic H1N1 influenza virus is
occurring in the Southern states of Kerala and Karnataka and the
Western state of Maharashtra due in part to the onset of the monsoon
season. The preceding report adds the Northern state of Sikkim to the
list.

Sikkim is a landlocked Indian state nestled in the Himalayas. It is
the least populous state in India and the 2nd smallest state after
Goa. The map of the Indian states at
