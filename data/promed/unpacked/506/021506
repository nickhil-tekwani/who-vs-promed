Department of Agriculture, Washington, DC:
Spring viremia of carp (SVC) was identified in a hatchery in Kernersville,
North Carolina. The case was diagnosed on 24 April 2002 and confirmed on 5
July 2002.
As a result of this detection, 135,000 koi were destroyed at the hatchery.
Despite the investigations, the source of the introduction of the virus
