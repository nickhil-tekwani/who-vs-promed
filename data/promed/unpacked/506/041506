UNDIAGNOSED MORTALITY IN DAIRY BUFFALOES: CORRECTION

From: D Stevenson <ds@holyrood.ed.ac.uk>

"The loss incurred...is estimated to run into at least Rs 4 crores
[Rs 400,000]."
If I am remembering correctly:
One Lakh = 100,000 (written in places using this system as 1,00,000)
One Crore = 100 Lakhs = 10,000,000 (written locally as 1,00,00,000)
Great confusion can be caused by mixing the two systems. In view of the
numbers of deaths I suspect that the loss is in Crores (tens of
millions) rather than in Lakhs (hundreds of thousands) of Rupees.
Four Crores would be 40 million.
