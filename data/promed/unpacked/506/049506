Citation: Systemic infection of SARS-CoV-2 in free ranging Leopard (_Panthera pardus fusca_) in India
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
We report the pathomorphological and virological characterization of SARS-CoV-2 in naturally infected, free-ranging Indian leopard (_Panthera pardus fusca_). Whole-genome sequence analysis confirmed infection of delta variant of SARS-CoV-2, possibly spillover from humans, but the case was detected when infection level had dropped significantly in the human population. This report underlines the need for intensive screening of wild animals for keeping track of the virus evolution and development of carrier status of SARS-CoV-2 among wildlife species.

[Carnivores (Order Carnivora) are susceptible to infection by SARS-CoV-2. The pandemic virus has been confirmed so far in carnivores of 6 families, canids (dogs and raccoon dogs), felids (cats, tigers, lions, puma/cougar, and snow leopard), mustelids (ferrets and minks), viverrids (binturongs), procyonids (coatimundis), and hyenids (hyenas). In most cases, infections are subclinical or mild, but there are some reports of deaths attributable to COVID-19.

So far, all wild carnivores that were diagnosed with COVID-19 were held captive at zoos, except for a free-ranging mink in Utah. The leopard of this report represents the 2nd wild carnivore found to be naturally infected by SARS-CoV-2. It was a cub of approximately 1 year of age, found dead in an agricultural field of Uttar Pradesh. Post mortem examination revealed piercing wounds in the head and neck, consolidation of both lungs, and congestion and hemorrhages in other organs. Brain, spleen, lymph node, and lung specimens were found positive for SARS-CoV-2. Although the proximal cause of death was probably the traumatic injuries inflicted by another carnivore, the findings strongly suggest the infected leopard was going through a moderate to severe disease due to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

This finding has 2 important implications. One is that it alerts about the possibility that the virus finds in these carnivores a niche where it can be maintained and evolve, circulating endemically as immunity in people builds up globally due to natural infection and vaccination. This is being observed in white-tailed deer, with findings of high rates of infection in many populations from the USA and Canada. Another major implication is that COVID-19 might add to the list of threats faced by many big cats, which already struggle to thrive in the midst of habitat fragmentation and degradation, climate change, poaching, and many other diseases. - Mod.PMB
