An extremely virulent form of bird flu has spread to a second B.C. hatchery
where 36 000 chickens must now be slaughtered, prompting officials to step
up inspections in their fight to keep the outbreak from getting out of
control and crippling the industry.
The farm, just 2 kilometres away from the property where disease first
struck [during February 2004], has been infected with the same strain of
avian flu, said Dr. Cornelius Kiley, a veterinarian with the Canadian Food
Inspection Agency.
"Over the weekend we will be euthanizing and disposing of 36 000 birds on
the farm, which are in a complex of 7 barns," said Kiley.
The strain confirmed Friday kills nearly 100 percent of birds it infects
but poses a low level of risk to humans.
The move comes just weeks after the gassing of 18 000 birds at the Loewen
Acres breeding operation in Abbotsford. Both farms are under quarantine
and government has cracked down further, declaring a huge control zone
restricting the movement of any bird in captivity, including pets, day-old
chicks, and hatching eggs. Farmers must now apply for a permit to move the
birds and any bird product including eggs out of the area that stretches to
the North Shore mountains, west to the ocean, south to the U.S. border, and
east to the town of Hope.
"The Trans-Canada Highway runs across the eastern corner where there are
weigh scales and we can monitor the trucking of products through there,"
Kiley said. The ocean and the mountains are natural barriers, and the U.S.
has banned B.C. poultry, turning around any cargo at the border. He said
the order is consistent with international standards for dealing with the
H7N3 strain of bird flu.
H7N3 commonly manifests as pink eye in people, but there is worry that it
could mutate and become more deadly in people who are already suffering
from the flu. A different strain -- H5 -- caused a number of fatalities in
Asia this winter.
4 people associated with the second farm were being monitored Friday but
were not showing any concerning symptoms, said a spokesman for the Fraser
Health Authority.
The CFIA has widened the area where it is conducting intense surveillance
to a 10-kilometre radius around the infected farms. Kiley said they have
every reason to believe the system is working. "It is because of our
active surveillance that we identified the virus on the second farm, where
only a very small number of birds had died. There is no indication there
is a problem anywhere else, but we can only take things one step at a time,
one day at a time," he said.
Kiley said the agency has to seriously investigate the source of the virus
because it seems it is managing to spread, despite containment
efforts. "We know the 2 farms are approximately 2 kilometres apart. The
virus typed out to be the same on both properties, which does suggest there
could be a link. It could be vehicular traffic, a common water source,
wild birds. We may never know."
Virology experts say the industry has been too lax in checking for bird
flu. If they had bothered to check, they would have found it smouldering in
the rural hatcheries a year before chickens began dying, said Earl Brown, a
virology professor at the University of Ottawa. Not stamping the disease
out earlier allowed it to mutate, become more deadly, and spread, he said.
The strict measures in place now are designed to ease concerns of Canada's
trading partners and show them that the outbreak is being aggressively battled.
The European Union banned all imports of poultry products and pet birds
from Canada on Thursday. 14 countries placed full or partial bans on
Canadian poultry after the first outbreak was confirmed. With news of
testing at a second property, Japan and the United States moved Wednesday
to keep the products out.
The value of all exports involving B.C. poultry, eggs and egg products is
about $22.5 million [almost USD 16.9 million], with over half the product
shipped to the United States.
Canadian poultry exports are worth $125 million [USD 93.7 million], and the
Chicken Farmers of Canada say they expect producers will suffer a serious
hit -- one that gets worse every day the bans continue.
