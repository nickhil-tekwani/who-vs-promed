Re: Ebola virus disease - West Africa (153): hospital ships
-------------------------------------
Some of the issues in this post are discussed in today's Foreign Policy [6 Sep 2014]: http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2014/09/05/we_could_have_stopped_this_ebola_virus_world_health_organization.

As you know, the AU [African Union] is sending in military personnel, though numbers and skills are unknown. The Canadian military has declined. DoD [US Dept. of Defense] is still mulling its role. There are many reasons for hesitation on the US's part, some of which I alluded to in the above cited piece.

[Excerpts: "Nearly all commercial airlines and air delivery companies have stopped flights to and from the 3 Ebola-stricken nations, and many have halted services across all of West Africa. As a result, personnel and supplies cannot get into the area, and exhausted health volunteers desperate for a break cannot get out. ... Happily, the government of Ghana has agreed to make Kotoka International Airport in Accra an air bridge for Ebola responses, allowing large aircraft from all over the world to land at Kotoka and smaller planes to shuttle personnel and supplies in and out of areas of need in the region. The WHO will assure that screening is in place at all of the region's airports to ensure that no ailing individuals fly to Ghana."

"While this is a long-overdue beginning, the air bridge -- if it is to come close to meeting the needs in the Ebola-stricken areas -- will require military-scale logistics and support. Having landing rights is only step one: Knowing where to warehouse goods, tracking their fate, loading secondary aircraft with proper destinations, and ensuring absence of theft are massively complex activities; just ask FedEx. Given the positive relations between Washington and Accra, it seems logical that the U.S. Air Force should supply transport flights and personnel, as well as warehousing and logistics support at Kotoka. ..."

"It seems unlikely that hundreds of commercial pilots, cargo handlers, and flight crew will volunteer to fly in and out of Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea, and even, if conditions worsen, Nigeria. Military pilots and crew, in contrast, often volunteer for dangerous missions. Supplies of everything from basic food for the people of Monrovia's slums to advanced medical equipment are desperately needed, and demand for everything will grow in tandem with the size of the epidemic. The U.S. military has the most sophisticated mobile response capacity and experience in the world. ... MSF can see the benefits of putting those medical boots on the ground. Washington officials say off the record that options for U.S. military assistance are under consideration and may be announced in a few days."

"But beyond bringing in military personnel to handle the logistics and air bridge support, the presence of uniformed foreign military personnel risks feeding conspiracy theories that already surround this epidemic. The classic canard of every modern epidemic -- that the germ was made or distributed by the CIA -- is already circulating in these countries. The existing "uniform" of hoods, gloves, goggles, and protection suits has already sparked anger and suspicion. A visible foreign military presence could not only fuel further suspicion but fan Islamist claims in Nigeria that infidels are contaminating vaccines."

"Any non-indigenous military use must be carefully considered, weighing the tremendous professional skills and experience combat medics could bring to the epidemic fight against potential blowback from conspiracy-mongers and Islamists."

The whole article is well worth reading. Garrett makes a strong case for military intervention by the USA with transport and logistics, while mentioning some of the potential problems with it. There are also formidable political constraints. - Mod.JW]

[2] Hospital ships

Re: Ebola virus disease - West Africa (153): hospital ships
---------------------------------------
Dr Boecken makes a good point about the MSF request for military medical support along with an "air bridge" for logistics and triage. As a former officer in the US Navy, here are a few points for practical consideration:

1st for hospital ships, only 2 nations have ocean-going and operational hospital ships: the USA (USNS Mercy and USNS Comfort) and China (PLAN Daishandao). Mercy and Comfort have 1000-1200 beds each; Daishandao has about 300-400 beds.

The next consideration is security and permission from the host countries. The military forces of Europe and North America are capable of medical support but do not deploy unless there is a request from the host nation desiring the aid and will not deploy without a significant security force. There are similar requirements for the military medical forces of Russia, China, Australia and Japan. To the best of my knowledge, such a request has not been sent by any nation affected by the outbreak.

A final consideration is which nations can conduct a sustained "air bridge" for logistics and medical triage. At this juncture, there is only a single nation with sufficient resources and "lift capacity" to conduct such a sustained mission, and again, this would require a considerable security force to be on the ground in the nations affected by this tragedy.

[USNS Mercy arrived in San Diego, California, USA from Hawaii on 9 Aug 2014: http://www.marinetraffic.com/pt/ais/details/ships/7390454/vessel:USNS_MERCY. Perhaps Dr Peruski could tell us where its next port of call will be, and the date, and if rescheduled, how many weeks it would take to reach Monrovia or Liberia?

What has been mentioned already in the media, but not yet as the deal-breaker, is that the key to controlling Ebola is changing human behaviors. As Garrett writes in [1] above: "There are 2 factors contributing to the rate of spread: the genetic capacities of the virus itself and the behaviors of human beings that put them in contact with one another, thereby passing the virus."

These include the attitude towards disease (witchcraft, denial), trust in herbal and other useless remedies, distrust of government and foreign aid workers (blamed for introducing the disease in the 1st place), ritual burial practices, attitude towards quarantine of apparently healthy contacts, and culpable irresponsibility of people who know they are infected but go around contaminating others (even doctors).

These can't be changed overnight. And before blaming uneducated Africans living in interior forest areas for those attitudes, many of the same attitudes are shown by westerners; for example: failure by householders of dengue-infected countries to clean up mosquito breeding sites on their property (Cuba eradicated dengue -- twice -- by enforcing that measure), refusal of childhood vaccination, trust in herbal medicines, and unproven "cancer cures."

But what is needed right now are measures to change the game overnight.

When the 1st few cases slip past quarantine into communities in the USA or Europe, the outpouring of huge amounts of money to take care of the situation, if spent earlier on more beds and health workers (and paying their salaries to avoid the current strikes) in West Africa, might have turned the situation there around (my personal view, not necessarily that of all the ProMED team). - Mod.JW
