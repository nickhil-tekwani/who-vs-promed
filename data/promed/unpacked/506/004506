Egypt's Foot-and-Mouth Disease Outbreak has Already Killed 10 000 Animals
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Despite government assurances that they were in control of Egypt's FMD, an outbreak has swept through the country, killing more than 10 000 animals to date. The UN Food and Agriculture Association (FAO) warns that 6.3 million buffalo and cattle and 7.5 million sheep and goats are at risk of contamination, and the General Authority for Veterinary Services claims that more than 60 000 animals have already contracted a new strain of the virus (SAT2) against which local livestock have no immunity.

Although human beings aren't typically at risk of contracting FMD, the outbreak has devastated the country's livestock population and sent prices soaring.

Many local Egyptians unable to trust government have turned to other sources of protein and businesses meat are suffering serious losses.

Overwhelmed, Egypt appealed to the FAO to help stay the outbreak.

"We are working closely to support the government to bring the outbreak under control," said Juan Lubroth, FAO's Chief Veterinary Officer adding that "The area around the Lower Nile Delta appears to be severely affected, while other areas in Upper Egypt and the west appear less so."

Egypt's small stock of vaccines aren't effective against the new strain, so Egypt needs regional help to import more vaccines.

"Even if they become available quickly, vaccines sometimes take up to 2 weeks to confer immunity," according to a recent FAO press release. "FAO is urging coordination at all levels of government to implement biosecurity measures to limit the spread of the disease."

In the meantime, livestock owners are urged to take the following measures to limit the spread.

- Limit animal movement and contact with animals from other farms
- Avoid purchasing new animals in the short term
- Properly dispose of infected carcasses by incineration or burying.

Hayani Saad, chairman of a meat producers association, told Egypt Independent that he expects vaccines and warmer temperatures to deter the disease by early April [2012].

Foot-and-mouth disease traps camels at Sudanese border
-----------------------------------------------------
A decision issued by Egypt's Agriculture Ministry preventing the transfer of animals across governorates borders to halt the spread of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) prevented the transfer of over 10 000 camels across the Egyptian-Sudanese border on Tuesday [27 Mar 2012].

An additional 6000 camels are currently stuck in a Suez quarry and on a commercial ship anchored in the Red Sea Port. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Agriculture is considering exempting camels from the decision.

The Association of Camel Importers threatened to protest against the ministry's decision to ban the transfer of animals that are not susceptible to FMD.

They threatened to surround the Ministry of Agriculture and cabinet building with thousands of camels and to cut off the roads connecting the border crossings with Delta governorates through which some 250,000 camels are transferred annually and which provide 40 percent of meat in the domestic market.

[According to chapter 2.1.5 of OIE's Manual of Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines for Terrestrial Animals 2011, amongst the camelidae, only Bactrian (bi-humped) camels and new world camelids have been shown to be susceptible to FMD. The camels in Sudan (and the Near East) are dromedaries (single humped). - Mod. AS].

4. LIVESTOCK MOVEMENT PATTERNS IN THE REGION AND IMPLICATIONS FOR FURTHER SPREAD
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Animal movement through formal trade is very intensive between countries in Sub-Saharan countries (Ethiopia, Sudan, and Djibouti) and Northern Africa (Egypt and Libya). Most countries in the MENA region are livestock importers, with live animal imports via the Mediterranean from Europe or the Americas or other parts of the Middle East, or across the Arabian Sea and Gulf from eastern Africa and Asia/Australasia. Intra-regional trade in large and small ruminants is limited except for exports in the past from Syria towards Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states.

For 6 countries including Algeria, Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Morocco, FAOSTAT data show in 2009, 175 034 heads of live animals (including cattle, small ruminants and buffaloes) valued at USD 167 191 000 were imported. The estimated exports for the same year for countries in the region was 1 536 899 heads with a value of USD 254 854 000. Control of animal importation across the borders of Libya and Egypt appears to have dramatically changed since the civil unrest of 2011, but this flow is likely to be inward; commercial livestock flows across the Egypt-Libya borders in 2011 and 2012 are unclear. The risk of eastward spread will depend not only on ontrol at land borders with Israel but also on the risk of "jumps across the sea" of infection through various routes including movements of people, fomites or returning ships that carried livestock to ports from infected countries.

According to official reports, most of the current FMD SAT2 outbreaks reported in Egypt are concentrated in the Nile Delta, an area where most intensive livestock farms are located. Animal movements within the country are generally from a south to north direction, with animals coming from Sudan and Ethiopia mainly during the months of March and April. There is also movement of animals from the quarantine station in Ain Sokhna in Suez Governorate to other areas of the country. These include animals imported from countries in the Horn of Africa and quarantined in Suez. In Egypt, during the epidemic of type A which occurred between January and March 2006, index cases occurred close to quarantine stations where animals from Ethiopia were held.

In addition to animal movements through quarantine stations, animals are also moved within the country in association with the nomadic Bedouins, mostly within one governorate. There is limited or no animal movement from Egypt to other countries in the region.

The role of Gazelle spp in transboundary movement of FMD is probably unlikely as only limited populations exist in the western desert and borders with the neighbouring countries to the east. Gazelle spp in the Middle East are known to be sensitive to FMD and mortalities have been recorded in Israel and Oman with type O. Infection in wildlife is probably self-limiting and close contact with nomadic pastoralists' animals is likely to be a source for these species.

Egypt and Libya have had several introductions of FMD virus types over the past 10 years. In Libya, these occurred in 2003 (SAT2), in 2009 (type A Iran 05 BAR-08) and 2010 (serotype O ANT-10), with the latter 2 following the regional pandemics in West Eurasia of the same lineages. In Egypt, in 2012 (SAT2),[preceded by] the 2006 incursion of an African serotype A from north-east Africa (FMD Virus Pool 4) with continued circulation, and the introductions of A Iran 05 BAR-08 and serotype O ANT-10, which are likely to have entered at the time of the regional epidemics but which were not detected until 2012. The 2006 incursion was devastating, and following the initial epidemic, this strain continued to circulate even after local vaccines were used, at least until 2011.

The emergence and rapid spread of FMD virus in West Eurasia (Virus Pool 3) has been well documented by the FAO/EuFMD and is one of the rationales behind the West Eurasia Regional Roadmap for FMD control involving 14 countries, from Pakistan through Turkey, thereby decreasing the risk to Europe, the Middle East and North Africa. The finding that West Eurasian epidemics may extend as far as Libya (on at least 2 recent occasions) indicates that east to west epidemics are a high risk although often mitigated by partial immunity through vaccination against A and O.

In the case of a current Asia-1 epidemic in West Eurasia that has reached western Turkey, and of SAT1 and SAT2 or exotic African type A viruses, existing control programmes do not cover the risks and more severe epidemics can be expected in the near future. For this reason, FAO/EuFMD, working with the FAO-WRL in Pirbright, places a high emphasis on improving early detection of new threats through support to FMD epidemiological surveillance networks in West Eurasia, Eastern Africa and West/Central Africa but faces the onsiderable hurdles of rapid disease spread in these regions coupled with limited sampling and local capacity to detect and characterise FMD virus samples, or respond quickly to changing events by providing vaccines that provide adequate immunity to new strains of FMD circulating. Building national capacity is central to establishing long-term Regional Roadmaps for FMD control in these endemic regions, such as the Roadmap for West Eurasia and for Eastern Africa which was drafted at an international meeting of FAO, OIE and AU-IBAR in Nairobi in March 2012.

Factors which influence animal movements in the MENA region include differentials on price of animals, their products, and the movement of people as they flee political or civil unrest, and religious celebrations such as Eid-al-Fitr, amongst others. In 2012, the Eid will be celebrated at the end of August, which implies an increased risk of virus dispersal across the region via increased movements of animals, particularly lambs, during the months of May through July, unless concerted prevention and control actions are implemented.

According to WRLFMD Dec 2011 recommendations, the SAT2 strain which is recommended to be included in FMD antigen banks (=strains to be included in vaccines when necessary) with "high priority" is SAT2 Saudi Arabia (or equivalent; eg Eritrea. Both are topotype VII). Though the genotyping results of the Libyan and Egyptian SAT2 2012 strains are not yet publicly available on the web-site of the WRLFMD, it may be deduced from fig 1 that the (commercially available) Eritrea vaccine strain (topotype VII) may be considered as a valid vaccine candidate. Early publication of the sequencing results of the Egyptian and Libyan SAT2 strains will be helpful. - Mod AS.]
