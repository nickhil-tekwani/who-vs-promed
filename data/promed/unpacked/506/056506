First Report of Zucchini yellow mosaic virus in Cucumber in Poland.
H. Pospieszny and M. Cajza, Institute of Plant Protection, Department
of Virology and Bacteriology, Miczurina 20, 60-318 Poznan, Poland;
and R. Plewa, Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznan, Department of
Experimental Biology, Animal Physiology, Fredry 10, 61-701 Poznan,
Poland. Plant Dis. 87:1399, 2003; published on-line as
D-2003-0912-01N, 2003. Accepted for publication 27 Aug 2003.
In June 2002, mosaic and interveinal chlorosis were observed on 2
cucumber plants (_Cucumis sativus_) grown in one commercial
greenhouse in the western region of Poland. Electron microscopic
examination of leaf-dip preparations from infected plants showed
flexuous filamentous virus particles typical of potyviruses (720 to
750 nm long).
_Chenopodium amaranticolor_, _Chenopodium quinoa_, _Citrullus
lanatus_, _C. melo_, _C. sativus_, _Cucurbita maxima_, _Cucurbita
pepo_, _Cucurbita pepo_ cv. Giromontiina, _Cucurbita pepo_ cv.
Patissoniana, _Nicotiana benthamiana_, and _N. tabacum_ were
mechanically inoculated with sap from symptomatic cucumber leaves.
The virus caused local chlorotic lesions on _Chenopodium
amaranticolor_ and _Chenopodium quinoa_ and systemic infection in all
tested cucurbits, but it did not infect tobacco plants.
Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)
amplification of the 3' end of the genomic RNA was done by using
P9502 as a downstream primer and degenerate CPUP as an upstream
primer to amplify a highly conserved region of the potyviral coat
protein (1).
The PCR products were directly sequenced with the CEQ DTCS dye
terminator cycle sequencing kit (Beckman Coulter, Inc., Fullerton,
CA), and the analysis of dideoxy terminated fragments was conducted
by capillary electrophoresis using a CEQ 2000 DNA Analysis System
(Beckman Coulter, Inc.).
The obtained 684 nt sequence (GenBank Accession No. AY347476) was
almost identical with sequences of Zucchini yellow mosaic virus
(ZYMV) isolates from Austria (GenBank Accession Nos.
AJ420012-AJ420019 and AJ420027) and Hungary (GenBank Accession Nos.
AJ459954 and AJ459955). The above suggested that the Polish isolate
of ZYMV belonged to the Central European branch of the phylogenetic
tree (2).
To our knowledge, this is the first report of ZYMV in Poland.

[ZYMV, a potyvirus, first observed in 1981 in France and Italy, has
since spread worldwide, affecting crops in at least 22 countries,
especially in Mediterranean countries, Central Europe and USA.
_Cucurbita pepo_ (pumpkin), _Cucumis melo_ (melon) and _Citrullus
lanatus_ (watermelon) are the predominant susceptible hosts. ZYMV is
often associated with papaya ringspot virus (PRSV-watermelon) or with
Watermelon mosaic virus (WMV) in tropical countries. The virus is
transmitted by several aphids including (_Aphis citricola_, _A.
gossypii_, and _Myzus persicae_). Evidence of seed transmission is
equivocal. Disease management utilizes reflective mulches, judicious
application of insecticides, and resistant cultivars. Some wild
cucurbits are sources of ZYMV resistance genes, which may have
application for developing resistant cultivars.
