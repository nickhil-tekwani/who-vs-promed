Bat-rabies virus (EBLV) has been confirmed in a Serotine bat, found in the municipality Freiburg "on the Elbe", in the district of Stade [not to be confused with the city of Freiburg in SW Germany].

The veterinary authorities are warning the public not to handle bats and to have all cats and dogs with outside access vaccinated against rabies by a veterinarian.

People are advised to stay away from bats and in case they are bitten or scratched by a potentially rabid bat should seek medical attention immediately.

Rabies in humans and animals is almost always deadly and any suspicion has to be reported to the veterinary authorities.

[The Stade district is situated in Northern Germany; see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_(district).

In Germany, rabies in bats is a notifiable zoonotic disease. The 1st rabies-infected insectivorous bat in Europe was recorded in Hamburg, Germany in 1954. Prior to the death of a bat worker in Finland in 1985, very few bat rabies cases were reported.

The following information is based upon a 2014 paper (referenced below).

In Europe, bat rabies is caused by several lyssavirus species. Between 1977 and 2012, a total of 1039 bat rabies cases were reported from European countries (http://www.who-rabies-bulletin.org). The majority was characterized as European bat lyssavirus type 1 (EBLV-1) isolated from Eptesicus bat species (_E. serotinus_, _E. isabellinus_). Genetically, EBLV-1 can be divided in 2 subtypes, EBLV-1a and 1b. While the EBLV-1a subtype is predominantly found in Central and Eastern Europe (France, The Netherlands, Denmark, Germany and Poland), EBLV-1b has been reported from Spain, France, Southern Germany, and central Poland.

European bat lyssavirus type 2 (EBLV-2) has been isolated from Daubenton's bats in the UK, Switzerland, Finland and Germany, and from Pond bats (_Myotis dasycneme_) in The Netherlands. As of today, 3 Natterer's bats (_Myotis nattereri_) infected with the novel Bokeloh bat lyssavirus (BBLV) have been found in Germany and France. A single detection of the West Caucasian bat virus (WCBV) in a Schreiber's bent-winged bat (_Miniopterus schreibersii_) has been reported from Western Caucasus Mountains.

The public health relevance of bat rabies in general is highlighted by the fact that most of the bat-associated lyssaviruses have caused human rabies. In Europe, both EBLV-1 and EBLV-2 were responsible for 4 confirmed human casualties. Also, sporadic spill-over infections of EBLV-1 to terrestrial mammals have been reported, i.e., in sheep in Denmark, 2 cats in France and a stone marten (_Martes foina_) in Germany.

According to FLI data, since the start of 2015, 13 positive bats have been recorded in Germany. Their typing results will be welcomed.
