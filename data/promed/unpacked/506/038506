The Plant Protection and Quarantine services [PPQS] has discovered a new fungus called _Goplana dioscoreae_ affecting yams in Dominica. It produces yellow to light-orange pustules on the leaf, which are more obvious on the upper surface and sometimes present on the leaf stalks and stems. The disease could cause reduction in tuberization and yield.

PPQS's Nelson Laville said [it] was identified in white [_Dioscorea alata_ or _rotundata_] and ladies yams [_D. cayenensis_] through laboratory diagnosis. A survey identified the fungus in the central, northeast, and east agricultural regions. [He] said advice will be given to famers and exporters on how to manage this disease to avoid spread.

Laville also encouraged farmers to refrain from moving planting material from farms. Although in some areas, the presence of the fungus is very low, it has the potential of spreading. [PPQS] has instructed famers to ensure that fields are clean, to remove and burn debris and fallen infected leaves, to use clean planting material, and to treat the plants with fungicides.

[Yams (_Dioscorea_ spp.) are important tuber crops in parts of Asia, Africa, and the Americas. Several rust diseases have been reported on yams in different regions. The fungus referred to above is winged yam (_D. alata_) rust, _Goplana dioscoreae-alatae_ (Gda; previously _G. dioscoreae_). Gda, as well as the related _G. australis_ (Ga), are known to occur in Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is not clear whether the term "new fungus" used in the story above actually means a 1st report from Dominica or the Caribbean region, or just a new outbreak in the country.

Symptoms of Gda and Ga include orange or yellow pustules, scattered or in small groups, on both leaf surfaces as well as petioles; pustules are initially covered by dark-coloured host tissue. A severe outbreak of yam rust in Micronesia in the early 2000s showed enhanced pustules on stems, with symptoms reported to resemble anthracnose (_Colletotrichum_ spp.). It was thought that a new, more virulent strain of Gda may have emerged in that region (see PestNet link below).

Rust spores are spread by wind, rain, and mechanical means, as well as with contaminated plant or other materials. Disease management relies mainly on fungicides, phytosanitation (as suggested above) or resistant crop cultivars, if available. Fungal spores that are wind borne or can easily be carried on travellers' clothes pose a very high biosecurity risk.
