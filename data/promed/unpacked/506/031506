A delayed emergency and challenges for reform: 5 key findings from AP story on WHO and Ebola
----------------------------------------------------------------------
In the aftermath of the world's biggest outbreak of Ebola, the World Health Organization acknowledged it was too slow to act, blaming factors including a lack of real-time information and the unprecedented nature of the epidemic.

But an investigation by The Associated Press has revealed the UN health agency knew from the start how unusual the outbreak was. Here are 5 key findings about WHO's response to Ebola in West Africa:

1. WHO officials privately floated the idea of declaring an international health emergency in early June [2014], more than a month before the agency maintains it got its 1st sign the outbreak merited one -- in late July [2014] -- and 2 months before the declaration was finally made on 8 Aug 2014.

2. WHO blamed its slow response partly on a lack of real-time information and the surprising characteristics of the epidemic. In fact it had accurate field reports -- including scientists asking for backup -- and it identified the unprecedented features of the outbreak. The agency was also hobbled by a shortage of funds and a lack of clear leadership over its country and regional offices.

3. Politics appear to have clouded WHO's willingness to declare an international emergency. Internal emails and documents suggest the UN health agency was afraid of provoking conflict with the Ebola-stricken countries and wary that a declaration could interfere with the economy and the Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca.

4. An Ebola-infected WHO consultant in Sierra Leone violated WHO health protocols, creating a rift with Doctors Without Borders [MSF] that was only resolved when WHO was thrown out of a shared hotel.

5. Despite WHO's pledges to reform, many of the proposed changes are recycled suggestions from previous outbreaks that have never taken hold. Any meaningful reform to the organization would likely require countries to rewrite the constitution, a prospect many find unpalatable.

[2] Guinea: 95 new cases
Date: Thu 19 Mar 2015
Source: Pulse.ng [edited]
http://pulse.ng/health/in-guinea-95-new-ebola-cases-confirmed-id3582236.html


The New York Times reports 95 new cases of Ebola have been confirmed in Guinea in the week that ended [Sun 15 Mar 2015]. This is the highest weekly total for the country so far this year.

Meanwhile Sierra Leone and Liberia continued to show improvements for the week; Sierra Leone reported 55 confirmed new cases which was the country's lowest weekly total since last June [2014].

Liberia on the hand continues its countdown to being an Ebola-free country as the country recorded no new confirmed cases for the 3rd consecutive week. 42 days, after the last negative test is done, must elapse before transmission of the highly contagious Ebola virus is considered to have ended in Liberia. [But note below, sadly a case of Ebola was confirmed in Liberia 20 Mar 2015. - Mod.LK]

A total of 10 154 people have died from the Ebola epidemic so far, with the most mortalities recorded in Liberia, Guinea, and Sierra Leone.

[3] WHO: reporting problems Guinea
Date: Fri 20 Mar 2015

Guinea only reported confirmed Ebola cases and deaths
-----------------------------------------------------
As the Ebola epidemic spread, WHO struggled with competing crises. In some ways the World Health Organization is small -- its roughly 7000 employees make it less than half the size of the US Centers for Disease Prevention and Control -- but its responsibilities are wide-ranging. Among other things, it monitors some 800 outbreaks every year. Most don't make international headlines. By mid-2014, several had.

The 1st was polio, which came back from the brink of extinction to claw its way into conflict zones such as Syria. Its rise was labeled an international health emergency in May [2014]. The 2nd was the baffling Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome, or MERS, which had sickened nearly 700 people and killed 204, mostly in the Arabian peninsula, by early June [2014].

It was around that time that West Africa's Ebola epidemic surpassed the previous largest outbreak, in Uganda, where it infected 425 people in 2000 and killed about half.

The triple threat came at a time of steeply reduced budgets for WHO following the 2008 financial crisis. Cuts have continued since; its outbreak department shrank by about 20 percent in 2013. At a 2 Jun 2014 meeting in Geneva, scientist Stephane Hugonnet warned that the agency was "overwhelmed with outbreaks."

In Africa, the true reach of Ebola was being obscured by Guinea's Ministry of Health, which only shared information on confirmed cases and deaths, according to WHO documents. That was a problem because refusing to report suspect and probable cases meant the world wasn't getting an accurate picture of the epidemic.

One alleged motivation was mining. Guinea has the world's largest reserves of bauxite, for example, and the mineral is its main source of foreign currency. Guinean officials' insistence on only reporting confirmed cases was intended to "minimize artificially the magnitude of the Ebola outbreak to reassure expatriates working in the mining industry," Pierre Formenty, the WHO Ebola expert, wrote in another trip report.

Another issue was the hajj [pilgrimage] in October 2014. If Saudi Arabia further restricted travel in the wake of the outbreak, that could become a political liability for Guinea, an overwhelmingly Muslim country.

WHO struggled to get the Guineans to open up, and at one point in June [2014] dispatched Dr Sylvie Briand, head of the pandemic and epidemic diseases department at WHO, to convince them to be more transparent. Briand said the dispute spilled out publicly when the Guinean government criticized WHO for publishing conflicting figures. "They were not happy," she said. In a memo sent to Margaret Chan days later, WHO officials noted the Guinean authorities interpreted the discrepancy between WHO and Guinean figures "as a threat to their credibility."

Meanwhile, WHO employees wondered whether headquarters should be doing more. On 4 Jun 2014, scientist Lucien Manga wrote to Briand to tell her senior staff in Africa had proposed declaring the Ebola outbreak a global emergency.

"What do you think and what is your advice?" Manga asked in an email. In a response tapped out over her iPhone the following day, Briand argued against the idea, saying it wouldn't help control the epidemic and might harm the countries involved. "It may be more effective to use other diplomatic means for now."

On 10 Jun 2014, Briand, her boss Dr Keiji Fukuda and others sent a memo to WHO chief Chan, noting that cases might soon pop up in Mali, Ivory Coast, and Guinea Bissau. But it went on to say that declaring an international emergency or even convening an emergency committee to discuss the issue "could be seen as a hostile act."

[4] Suiting up
Date: Fri 20 Mar 2015

A sweaty trip inside Bill Gates's mock Ebola ward
--------------------------------------------------
I was visiting the "Suiting Up for Ebola" room at a conference on Ebola, in an exhibit intended to give attendees a dose of health worker reality. It wasn't completely realistic; I was in a climate-controlled room, and while the Ebola personal protective equipment (PPE) is heavy, the experience was not exactly like being in a sweltering Ebola ward in Sierra Leone or Liberia. Nonetheless, health workers who had been out treating Ebola patients in the field led the simulation, and the experience was startling.

The suiting-up experience alone was intense. First, I put on a pair of stiff rubber boots, followed by surgical gloves and a large yellow suit, zipped up in the front. Next came the thick surgical mask over my face. That was right around the time when beads of sweat started forming on my forehead and my breathing became a little labored. I then put on a plastic apron, a protective mask to go over my head, a pair of plastic goggles, and a 2nd pair of gloves. I was nearly good to go, but had to remove my glasses since they didn't fit under the goggles. I was about three quarters blind. "It's more realistic that way," explained one of the doctors. Sweat and goggle fog often make it difficult for health workers to see.

As one health worker explained, sweat can be dangerous. Once a person's face mask becomes sopping wet, they need to get out of their suit immediately. They are essentially being water boarded by the mask. Even when that doesn't happen, workers often don't stay in the ward for more than 2 hours, lest they get lightheaded and start to lose their full cognitive abilities. The next step: Someone wrote my name in a Sharpie on my protective mask, since I was completely unidentifiable. Then it was time to go into the ward.

Along with a few other people suited up in gear, I went through a series of challenges that would normally be simple if not for my poor vision and the PPE. First, I held a saline IV drip above my head for 2 minutes, squeezing it hard the whole time. In real Ebola wards, health workers actually have to do this for 20 minutes or longer. They can't just hang the IV and leave it be, because patients might wake up in a panic, rip it out, and splatter bodily fluids all over the place. After going through a few more exercises -- sorting "pills" from a jar into a small cup, writing a math equation on a small whiteboard -- it was time to move onto the doffing station to get out of our suits. By this point, I was full-on sweating. Getting out of the suit was the hardest part. It went something like this. Get sprayed down with chlorine, pretend to wash my hands. Take off the apron, wash my hands again. Take off the gloves, wash my hands. You get the idea. Throughout the process, there were about a thousand moments when a single wrong move could have led to contamination.

There was one key decision that made my Ebola ward experience especially difficult: I declined to wear a cooling vest. These vests weren't available to the health workers in the mock ward when they were out in the field, but they are being deployed now. The vests came about when [Bill] Gates asked a group of experts who research technologies to keep vaccines cool if they could shift their attention to a human cooling apparatus -- a solution to overheating in the PPE. Designed by Intellectual Ventures' Global Good fund, the vest couldn't be more simple: It's just a vest with pockets for ice packs. 4 weeks after beginning the search for a solution, the vest was being shipped out to West Africa.

Not everyone opts to wear the vest, since it is yet another layer to take on and off. It also doesn't necessarily allow workers to stay out in the field longer, says Morgan Fowler, one of the vest's inventors. But it does help them stay more cognitively alert while they're working, since it slows the rise of core body temperature (and thus slows the process that makes people delirious). Even in the comfortable climate of the mock Ebola ward, I was wishing for a cooling vest by the end. It is such a small thing, a vest, but one that make the lives of tireless health workers just a little bit better -- and after dragging my wimpy self through the Ebola simulation, I can safely say that these people deserve all of the help they can get.
