The number of dengue deaths has risen to 165 while over 14 000 cases
have been reported in Sri Lanka so far from hospitals countrywide,
officials from the Department of Government Information said on Monday
[6 Jul 2009]. This represents a sharp increase as [only] 4156 dengue
cases and 85 deaths were reported for the whole year of 2008.

In a bid to control the rapidly spreading dengue epidemic, the health
authorities have decided to import Cuban bacteria to tame the virus.
The rapid rise in the level of the epidemic has forced the health
authorities to carry out an extensive public awareness campaign to
eradicate the mosquito based epidemic.

Households have been warned to keep the environment free of
mosquitoes. Those who allow the mosquitoes to breed by allowing
stagnating water face prosecution. A special hotline is available for
public information.

[The "Cuban bacteria" mentioned above are probably _Bacillus
thuringiensis serovar. israelensis_, an organism which produces toxins
that are insecticidal and widely used as a mosquito larvacide. Neither
the organism nor its toxins have any effect at all on dengue viruses
themselves.

The state medical directorate today rushed a team to Moreh in Chandel
district following reports of an outbreak of fever with dengue-like
symptoms. The border town of Manipur has a record of outbreak of
dengue. The outbreak was confirmed by Imphal's Regional Institute of
Medical Sciences (RIMS) in November 2007 after blood samples collected
from an 8-year-old girl, [who] tested positive for dengue at the
Mumbai-based SRL Ranbaxy Lab. The state health department announced
total control of dengue outbreak in Moreh within 8 days of
confirmation of the outbreak.

The medical team headed by Th. Bhubanchandra, additional director
(public health), left Imphal for Moreh this morning [8 Jul 2009] to
investigate a possible outbreak of dengue.

Medical personnel posted at the border town reported that by 19 June
[2009] a large number of people with fever and nearly 200 patients
with dengue-like symptoms, were admitted to the government hospital in
the town. "We could not say whether dengue has returned in Moreh. We
will carry out investigations and confirm only after testing blood
samples," Bhubanchandra said before leaving for Moreh.

The medical team, which will stay in Moreh for a few days, will
collect blood samples of patients and try to conduct tests to find out
if any of the mosquito species carrying dengue virus are present in
the town. After the team collects the samples, the state health
department will send them to the Vector Control Research Centre,
Pondicherry, for confirmation of dengue and other diseases. An expert
team on malaria is already carrying out investigations in Moreh.
Reports said some patients have tested positive.

Moreh, the border town between India and Myanmar, has a large number
of floating population, mostly on business trips. Health experts
suspect that the source of dengue that broke out in 2007 was the South
Asian countries.

Even before it has got its act together to combat malaria, Kolkata
Municipal Corporation (KMC) now faces the challenge to curb dengue in
the city.

The state health department has already recorded 73 dengue cases this
year [2009]. KMC health department officials conceded that the
situation was quite serious in parts of north Kolkata like
Kankurgachi, Ultadanga and Manicktala that together account for 45
cases. Other affected areas are Camac Street, Bhowanipore, Dhakuria,
Jodhpur Park and Lake Gardens. The health department has asked KMC to
take immediate preventive measures to stop the disease from spreading.

KMC's member, mayor-in-council (health), Subodh De, conceded that the
situation called for immediate civic intervention. "I have heard that
the situation is alarming at some places and have asked KMC health
officials to keep a close tab on the malaria- and dengue-prone areas,"
he said.

Dr Le Bich Lien, head of the Ho Chi Minh (HCM) City Paediatrics
Hospital No 1's Dengue Fever Ward, said the hospital had admitted
20-30 dengue fever cases a day since the end of June [2009]. "Most
patients live in HCM City and several have symptoms of a serious
illness when being admitted to the hospital," Lien said.

The hospital's dengue fever ward has only 80 beds, but last week it
provided treatment for more than 100 patients.

HCM City had more than 4000 dengue fever cases in the 1st half of the
year [2009], an increase of 50 percent against the same period last
year [2008], according to the Ministry of Health's Department of
Preventive Medicine and Environment.

Tran Van Ngoc, head of the HCM City Tropical Diseases Hospital's
Paediatrics Ward A, said the number of children with dengue fever had
increased rapidly in the past few weeks. The HCM City Tropical
Diseases Hospital on Monday had 50 dengue fever child patients, and
admitted 30 dengue fever adult patients last week.

Rainy days over the last few weeks have created ideal conditions for
the development of larvae and mosquitoes which carry and transmit the
dengue fever virus, in the city's districts, especially in outlying
districts. Phan Van Nghiem, head of the HCM City Health Department's
Medical Professional Office, said unclean residential areas
contributed to the problem. Nghiem told the public to keep the
surroundings of their houses clean and regularly clean tools [sic:
presumably a typo for "pools" - Mod.JW] and containers of water.

The city leads the country's 15 cities and provinces hardest hit by
dengue fever this year. The Department of Preventive Medicine and
Environment has set up 4 teams to monitor the task of combating dengue
fever in those localities since early this month. The inspection will
last until Friday [10 Jul 2009].

Rainy season could trigger dengue outbreak: ministry
----------------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health has warned that the coming rains could bring
about a resurgence in dengue fever as 26 people have already been
killed by the mosquito-borne illness so far this year [2009].

Nguyen Huy Nga, head of the ministry's Bureau for Preventive Health
and Environment, said many southern provinces had seen dramatic rises
in infection rates recently. He warned the rainy season could bring
more deaths. Some 25 700 people have contracted dengue fever in Viet
Nam so far this year [2009], 25 percent more than the same period last
year [2008], according to the ministry.

Nga said the fact that Mekong Delta residents often stored their water
in large open containers had contributed to the increase in mosquito
populations that transmit the dengue virus. The health ministry warns
about this problem every year. Nga also said that all 4 known strains
of the virus had been detected in Viet Nam and that a patient could
contract more than one type, making the sickness more difficult to
diagnose.

The Bureau for Preventive Health and Environment is inspecting
anti-dengue measures in 15 cities and provinces with high infection
rates. The inspectors are expected to submit detailed reports on the
causes of the outbreaks complete with instructions on how to boost
preventive measures.

Fever in the southland
----------------------
The HCMC [Ho Chi Minh City] Pasteur Institute has reported 20 967
cases of dengue fever in 20 central and southern cities and provinces
from Da Nang to Ca Mau as of [21 Jun 2009], 23 percent higher than the
same period last year [2008], Lao Dong (Labor) newspaper reported. Of
the cases, 23 had died, 7 in Ho Chi Minh City and the rest in the
Mekong Delta. Some provinces had infection rates that tripled last
year's [2008] figures.

Health authorities in Tien Giang Province have reported an abnormal
increase in dengue infections with one dead and more than 900 patients
hospitalized so far this year [2009]. Soc Trang Province in the delta
has also reported an increase of dengue patients, with around 150 new
cases hospitalized every week recently. In the 1st 6 months, Soc Trang
admitted 2380 dengue patients to hospitals. The disease killed 5
children in the province so far this year [2009] while only 2 dengue
patients died in Soc Trang in the whole of 2008.

Meanwhile, there have been 4649 dengue cases recorded in HCMC over the
1st 6 months this year [2009], Saigon Tiep Thi newspaper reported. The
paper said there had been more recorded cases of hemoconcentration, a
loss of fluidity in the blood, and bleeding due to the disease.

HCMC-based Children's Hospital No. 1 said it had admitted more than
100 patients on Wednesday [1 Jul 2009], including 23 cases in critical
condition. Children's Hospital No. 2 in the city said it had admitted
an average of 90 cases a day this week, doubling figures from last
week. The city's Department of Health said many patients were from
districts 8, Binh Thanh and Thu Duc.

Doctor Le Bich Lien, head of the dengue fever ward at Children's
Hospital No. 1, said 90 percent of all patients were under 15 years
old. Around 85 percent of the children's conditions would worsen, she
said. She also advised parents to take their children to the hospital
if they had high temperatures, adding that dengue fever could easily
be mistaken for common viral fever.

The disease often gets much worse after the symptoms show, which often
takes several days after infection, and patients could suffer internal
bleeding, muscle contractions and breathing difficulties. After 2-3
days of infection, a dengue patient may regain a normal temperature
but the illness then becomes worse with a rash and signs of fatigue,
cold limbs, clammy skin, bleeding of the nose, gums and even bloody
vomit or feces. After about a week, the worst cases enter Dengue Shock
Syndrome, Lien said which could damage internal organs or become fatal
if the patient is not treated properly.

Dengue fever may become [epidemic] in southern Viet Nam
-------------------------------------------------------
The Health Ministry on [2 Jul 2009] said more than 25 000 dengue fever
cases were recorded in the 1st half of 2009, including 26 deaths,
mainly children, up by 25 percent year on year.

The disease mainly developed in southern and central provinces, namely
Phu Yen, Binh Dinh, Quang Ngai, Ninh Thuan, Ba Ria, Vung Tau, Can Tho,
Hau Giang, Kien Giang and HCM City. In HCM City, some hospitals
recorded an increase of 50-70 percent of dengue fever patients since
mid June [2009].

The Preventive Health and Environment Agency's chief Dr. Nguyen Huy
Nga said that dengue fever rose because of many reasons, including
climate change. From 2000 to 2007, the number of patients increased by
4-fold compared to 1980-1989. The habit of Vietnamese people of
storing water in open tanks is also a major factor in the development
of mosquitoes and thus the spread of dengue fever [epidemics] in the
above provinces and cities.

The Health Ministry is worried that dengue fever may become [epidemic]
in the southern region in late 2009. The ministry has asked local
administrations to take measures to prevent the disease.

[At present, 25 700 cases and 26 deaths of dengue infection have been
detected in Viet Nam during 2009 with most of the cases reported from
southern provinces. There are 4649 cases and 7 deaths reported in Ho
Chi Minh City, more than 900 cases and one death in Tien Giang
province, and more than 2380 cases and 5 deaths in Soc Trang province
in 2009.

At the beginning of July 2008, 28 provinces and cities in Viet Nam had
reported more than 20 000 cases and 20 deaths which included more than
4000 cases and 3 deaths in Ca Mau province, more than 1400 cases and
one death in Tien Giang province, and more than 1900 cases in Soc
Trang province (see prior PRO/MBDS posting Dengue - Viet Nam (07)
20080708.2075).

Of note is that double infection with heteroserotypes of dengue
viruses might exist in Viet Nam, as all 4 serotypes of dengue viruses
had been detected previously.

In the state [Rio de Janeiro, the number of dengue cases] decreased
from 246 087 cases in 2008 to 10 424 this year. People have created
resistance [develped immunity?] to the disease [infection], but
fighting it continues. According to the Ministry of Health, Rio de
Janeiro was the state with the greatest reduction in numbers of dengue
cases in Brazil.

The state Secretariat of Health reported that January to June this
year [2009], 10 424 people had the disease, versus 246 087 registered
cases during the same period of last year [2008]. The fall in [numbers
of] cases of the disease is 95 percent. According experts, the types
of [dengue] virus circulating in Rio, are the same [as those in the]
epidemic of 2008. Therefore, most of people may have created
resistance [developed immunity] to the disease. Moreover, the effort
to combat the mosquito population also contributed much to the fall in
the number of cases.

Every day [vector control] officials are going out into the streets to
inspect the houses. Each region of the city has permanent officials;
for example, some neighborhoods pay attention to them such as Cachabi
and Todos os Santos. But the officials do not always have an easy job.
Many people do not allow the professionals into their homes. "Many
people still do not allow our entry, which has made the job difficult
because we cannot go in to do the survey [of _Aedes aegypti_
infestation]," said another official.

[Sometimes I wonder if these statements by the Ministry of Health are
the result of ignorance or a tentative, bumbling effort to deceive the
people. Dengue is a disease of fluctuating incidence, with epidemics
in some years and few cases in others. The fact we did not have an
epidemic in Rio de Janeiro in 2009 could not, necessarily, be due to
the control measures, but most likely is a result of normal
fluctuation. Within 2 or 3 years there is a considerable likelihood
that we will have another epidemic. This is the case in Brazil and in
almost all countries where dengue is endemic and epidemic. The public
deserves more accurate and honest information. - Mod.LJS]

[Without quantification of dengue virus vector mosquito presence in
houses and buildings over time, it is difficult to know how effective
the mosquito control program has been. Similarly, no data are
presented that indicate the antibody prevalence rates, and hence "herd
immunity" of the population, to the dengue virus serotypes that are
circulating currently.

[Numbers of] dengue cases are beginning to decline in Bahia. The
epidemiological bulletin published by the State Department of Health
shows that the number of notifications of cases of dengue in Bahia
continues to fall. The progressive decrease in the number of patients
began in early April [2009].

In the last week of June [2009], 320 new [dengue] cases were recorded
throughout the state. Up to the beginning of April more than 1000
cases per week were reported, which contributed to the state reaching
a record [number] of dengue cases, 93 191, this year [2009]. This
represents an increase of nearly 190 percent in comparison with the
same period of 2008. This year [2009], 391 municipalities have
reported cases of dengue.

Itabuna, Ilheus, Jequie, Porto Seguro, Salvador and Feira Santana
account for 42 percent of reported dengue cases. These cities also
have the greatest number of cases of DHF.

The good news is that the index of _Aedes aegypti_ larvae is falling
steadily. In some districts of Itabuna, Ilheus & Jequie the number of
breeding sites of mosquito vectors of the [virus] fell by 50 percent.
The disease killed 56 people this year.

Tonala is facing a dengue outbreak. It is not known if the virus that
is circulating in the municipality is dengue virus type 1 or 3. The
Tonala municipality has recorded 17 cases of classical dengue [virus
infection], and the other probable cases are under study, which turns
this into the 1st municipality in the Guadalajara Metropolitan Zone
with a dengue outbreak so far this year [2009]. All the cases have
been recorded since the 2nd week of June, in neighboring areas of
Altamira, in Tonala, but it is not known if the virus that is
circulating is type 1 or 3, recently found in the state [Jalisco],
stated the Chief of Epidemiology of the Jalisco Secretariat of Health,
Lucía Salazar Montes.

She indicated that epidemiological surveillance was being done, but it
is of vital importance that patients seek [medical] attention in case
they present with [dengue] symptoms, even more so if they currently
are from the affected neighborhoods.

Salazar Montes reported that in epidemiological [week] 25, which
covers 21 - 27 June [2009], 28 new [dengue] cases were recorded in the
state, only one of which was DHF. During this same week, health region
11 [personnel] identified 4 probable [dengue] cases in the Tonala
neighborhood, which initiated the deliberate search where the rest of
the cases were found.

Up to the present time, the unit has recorded 157 classical dengue
cases and 15 of DHF, for a total of 172 people infected so far this
year [2009].

[The concern is that the greater Guadalajara area, which includes
Mexico's 2nd largest city and satelite cities around it, has a
population of approximately 4 million people, an ample number of hosts
to sustain a significant dengue outbreak if the _Aedes aegypti_
mosquito population is adequate to maintain transmission of the virus.
