Crows dropping dead in cities and towns across Jharkhand [eastern
India] have sparked panic among the people of the state after health
officials pointed a finger at avian virus.

The Jharkhand animal husbandry department (AHD) has sounded an alert
and asked people not to touch the dead crows. It has issued
advertisements in local dailies asking people to keep away from the
dead birds and inform the administration when they spot dead crows.

Health department officials suspect the crows are infected with H5 or
H1 avian [influenza] virus. "Human beings should stay away from the
crows. If the virus enters the human body, it could [cause] an
epidemic," a health department official told IANS.

"An advisory has been issued considering the deaths of crows in many
districts. Expert teams are trying to ascertain the reason behind the
deaths of the crows," animal husbandry department director AG
Bandhopadhya told reporters.

Dead crows have been found in large numbers in Ranchi, Jamshedpur,
Bokaro, Khunti, Sahebganj and other districts of the state. A team of
experts of the Indian Veterinary Research Institute of Bhopal is in
Jharkhand to ascertain the reasons behind these deaths.

Jharkhand has been keeping different institutes of the country and the
Central government posted about the latest developments.

Two months ago [September 2011], West Bengal and Assam saw a spurt in
bird flu cases, triggering culling of poultry and eggs (see refs.
below). This prompted other states including Tripura to impose a ban
on import of poultry products from these 2 states.

The 1st reports of bird flu in India came from Nawapur in Nandurbar
district of Maharashtra in 2006. Within 5 days of confirmation about
the outbreak, over 2.5 lakh [250 000] chicken and lakhs [lakh=100 000]
of eggs were destroyed. Villagers exhibiting flu-like symptoms were
quarantined and kept under observation. Movement of people into the
area was strictly regulated and passenger trains were instructed not
to halt at Nawapur.

[Avian influenza outbreaks in poultry caused by highly pathogenic
avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus were confirmed in West Bengal, India
in August/September 2011 (see ProMED-mail archives 20110909.2747 and 20110923.2882). West Bengal is a state immediately east of Jharkhand.
A recent news post on this crow die-off episode,
(http://crofsblogs.typepad.com/h5n1/2011/11/india-bird-flu-like-virus-killing-jharkhand-crows.html),
claims that a flu-like virus was found in the brain of the dead crows,
although not in the feces or in oral swabs, suggesting that these
birds are acting as dead-end hosts. Apparently, the clinical signs
shown by the infected crows include quivering, high body temperatures,
and convulsions. It would be important to have information on the
associated pathological findings. HPAI H5N1 virus is not transmitted
from human to human, so an outbreak in people would depend on the
exposure to sick reservoir hosts. More information on the results of
tests being carried out is requested. - Mod.PMB]

[Suspected malaria cases were occurring in Jharkhand last month
(November)
http://infochangeindia.org/health/news/malaria-spreads-in-jharkhand.html
so it is likely that mosquitoes were active, and therefore the
possibility of West Nile virus killing these crows should be excluded
by lab tests. - Mod.JW]
