Letter sent to Senate majority leader tested positive for anthrax
------------------------------------------------------------------------
A letter opened Monday in the office of Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle
tested positive for anthrax, prompting a criminal investigation into a
bioterrorism scare that has now spread to Capitol Hill. The letter, which
contained a powdery substance, was
dispatched to an Army medical research facility at Fort Detrick, Md., for
further examination after a pair of preliminary tests in Daschle's office
came back positive, Capitol Police Lt. Dan Nichols said. The Fort Detrick
findings wouldn't be available until Tuesday, officials said. The
preliminary test, which looks for genetic markers, has a high rate of false
positives. One federal official cautioned that further testing is needed to
confirm the letter included anthrax.
Daschle was in the Capitol and was not exposed to the letter, which was
opened in his other office a block away in the Hart Senate Office Building.
Aides who may have been exposed to the letter were tested and being treated
with the antibiotic Cipro as a precaution, said Dr. John Eisold, attending
physician in the Capitol.
Daschle said about 40 people were in his office when the letter was opened.
It was initially unclear how many may have been exposed and were being
treated. The senator said his office was being quarantined while officials
awaited test results, and it would be closed for several days while it is
cleaned.
In Trenton, N.J., Postal Inspector Tony Esposito and FBI officials said the
letter to Daschle was postmarked in Trenton on 18 Sep 2001, the same date and
postmark on a letter that infected an NBC employee in New York last week.
Officials also were testing a female mail carrier and male maintenance
worker in Trenton who reported possible symptoms of anthrax, Esposito said.
Elsewhere Monday:
Postal inspectors said some anthrax spores were found in the Boca Raton,
Fla., post office that handled mail for American Media Inc., the tabloid
publisher that lost a photo editor to anthrax.

A letter containing a white powdery substance that tested positive for the
potentially deadly bacteria anthrax was sent to Senate Majority Leader Tom
Daschle. The letter was received at Daschle's personal office in the Hart
building at approximately 10:30 a.m. today and was opened and handled by
one of the South Dakota Democrat's interns and a
member of his staff. Two preliminary field tests performed by Capitol
Police indicated the presence of anthrax spores.
President Bush disclosed the incident this afternoon after speaking on the
phone with the Senate leader. "His office received a letter, and it had
anthrax in it," the president told reporters during a photo op with Italian
Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi in the White House Rose Garden. "He said it
was a letter that had been wrapped a lot and that the powder was within the
confines of . the envelope." Sources said the letter was wrapped in tape and
contained a note that read: "This is anthrax."
Daschle's office has been quarantined and between 40 and 50 people -
including members of his staff and other personnel who may have come in
contact with the letter - are being tested and treated with antibiotics for
possible anthrax exposure.
All mail deliveries to Capitol Hill have been suspended and unopened letters
and packages received by House and Senate offices were being collected as
officials put new screening procedures in place. Tours of the Capitol
building have also been canceled indefinitely.
. Probe Focuses on Trenton, N.J.
Officials said the letter delivered to Daschle's office was postmarked on
Sept. 18 in Trenton, N.J. - the same date and place as on the postmark of an
envelope holding a brown granular substance containing anthrax spores that
was mailed to NBC News anchor Tom Brokaw in New York. The Trenton facility
processes mail from 46 other area post offices, making it difficult for
federal investigators to pinpoint the precise location from which each
letter was mailed. Postal Inspector Tony Esposito said two employees at the
facility were being treated with antibiotics as a precaution. "Some symptoms
that they were having that could be loosely construed as being anthrax
symptoms," he said. "They could also be symptoms from common cold and
flu-like symptoms."
. Tracing the Strains
Federal authorities, meanwhile, expect to know soon whether the anthrax
spores that infected a woman in New York are from the same strain that
killed a Florida man. The Centers for Disease Control were nearing
completion an analysis of anthrax spores discovered at American Media Inc.
in Boca Raton, Fla., and those found in the letter sent to NBC.
A senior federal health official told ABCNEWS the strain on anthrax found in
Florida is the so-called Ames strain - one that was originally cultivated in
Iowa, but used in research laboratories around the world.

More anthrax spores found in Florida
------------------------------------
A small number of anthrax spores were discovered in a Boca Raton,
Florida, U.S. Postal Service mail-sorting facility that handled mail for the
tabloid publishing company where the first anthrax exposures were
discovered, Florida health officials said Monday. The bacteria were found in
a remote section of the building, which remained open Monday even after the
discovery was announced. The facility is not open to the public. All
employees are undergoing prophylactic treatment with antibiotics and are
undergoing testing to determine whether they have been exposed to the
bacteria, a spokesman for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
told CNN.
The building was one of 3 tested after it was confirmed that a photo editor
at the tabloid The Sun had contracted the inhaled form of the bacteria. He
later died, the first such death in the United States since 1976.

Second Florida tabloid worker diagnosed with inhaled anthrax, health
officials say
---------------------
Florida health officials said Monday that a 73-year-old mailroom employee
at a supermarket tabloid in the state has been diagnosed with the inhaled
form of anthrax. [The man "is improving and the public health officials
are encouraged by his
progress," the officials said in a statement. [He has been receiving
treatment for anthrax since he was hospitalized earlier this month for what
was then believed to be pneumonia.
More than 300 AMI employees are expected to undergo a second round of blood
tests to detect the presence of anthrax antibodies. Palm Beach County health
officials said the tests could begin as early as Wednesday. The first round
of blood tests taken last Wednesday on some 400 employees and visitors to
AMI were complete but not yet available.
Earlier, health and postal officials said a small amount of anthrax spores
was found in a Postal Service mail sorting facility in Boca Raton. The
building handles mail for American Media. Nasal swabs of 30 workers at the
facility came back negative for anthrax, Postal Inspector Manny Gonzalez
said.

Child of ABC Employee Gets Anthrax
----------------------------------
A child of an ABC News employee has been tested positive for anthrax, a
government official said Monday. The official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the child is being treated with antibiotics and is expected
to recover. The anthrax diagnosed in the child is the type that is absorbed
through cuts or scratches in the skin, not the more dangerous inhaled
variety, the source said.
The child had visited the ABC newsroom in New York in the last week,
probably 8 Oct 2001, the source said. [During a CNN interview this evening,
NYC Mayor Giuliani said that the child had visited the newsroom on 28 Sep
2001. - Mod.ES
[If this child was infected with cutaneous anthrax at ABC, this is a new
target site -- though not unexpected. The visiting date is of concern. -

[There have been some comments for a number of days about the severity of
the second Florida patient's condition being downplayed by the Florida
authorities. The above would confirm such concerns. The franking date on
Senator Daschle's letter, 18 Sep 2001 -- the same date and post office as
the letter to NBC, New York, would indicate that this latest revelation is
not of a third posting but of a second letter in an apparent second patch
of letters mailed. If there are other contaminated letters, presumably they
will be revealed in due course. Some miscellaneous news culled from earlier
reports: The Nevada people tested negative, 4/6 on confirmation, 2/6 on
preliminary only. The 5 seropositive people in Florida had "slightly
elevated" titres. - Mod.MHJ
