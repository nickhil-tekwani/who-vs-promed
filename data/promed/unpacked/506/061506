A recent study from Kansas State University found that soybean seed samples collected across Kansas contained fungi capable of producing diseases. Chris Little, who oversaw the research, [said], "We've found that some isolates of the _Fusarium_ species commonly found in soybean seeds are resistant to commonly used fungicides." [This] raises concerns about the role that widespread fungicide seed treatments may play in the development of fungicide resistance.

[In] more than 400 samples from 11 locations, _Fusarium_ species were present in the internal seed tissues of 100 per cent, and some of those strains were capable of causing soybean diseases. Little said, "It is possible that these fungi, which are present in soil and crop debris, are introduced into the flower and pod during development."

At least some of the _Fusarium_ species in the seeds proved resistant to common fungicides. Fungicide use has risen dramatically in the past decade, both in foliar applications and seed treatments, which are applied to the majority of all corn and soybean seed planted in the U.S. The fact that fungal pathogens might be present before a treated seed even hits the ground raises the specter of large-scale selection for fungicide resistance.

[Extensive use of fungicides is generally considered necessary to maintain current conventional high production systems and consequently fungicide resistance has become one of the most important issues in modern agriculture. Different groups of fungicides exist, with each group targeting different sites in the pathogen metabolism. Resistance to one member of a group will usually also confer resistance to other chemicals of the same group.

Emergence of resistant strains is encouraged by incorrect applications of the chemicals and use of single compounds. Both facilitate the establishment of pathogen strains with mutations leading to resistance to a respective fungicide, which may occur during the continuous process of pathogen evolution. The report above adds an important consideration to this issue by showing that new resistant strains may not only emerge in the field, but also from seed treatments.

To decrease the likelihood of development of fungicide resistant pathogen strains, it is important to apply mixtures of multiple fungicides from different classes. Pathogen strains resistant to such mixtures would require multiple simultaneous mutations conferring separate resistances to the different groups. The likelihood of appropriate mutations occurring simultaneously in a single organism, and thus the emergence of pathogen strains with simultaneous resistance to more than one fungicide class, is considerably smaller than for a single suitable mutation to occur.

Another option is the use of crop varieties resistant to a particular pathogen, since resistant varieties do not need to be protected by fungicides. However, to stay ahead of pathogen evolution and be prepared for the emergence of host resistance breaking pathogen strains, ongoing resistance breeding programmes are needed.
