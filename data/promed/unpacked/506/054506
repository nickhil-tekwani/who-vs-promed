According to the most recent data published by the Laurentian Public Health Department, since the beginning of 2018, 3 cases of Lyme disease infection have been reported in the region. On average since 2013, there are about 10 cases per year.

"The number of cases is increasing," says Julie Lemieux-Côté, CISSS Laurentides [Centre Intégré de Santé et de Services Sociaux (CISSS) des Laurentides or Integrated Health and Social Services Center of the Laurentians]. On the other hand, she says, the prevalence rate -- the number of cases per 100 000 population --, remains lower in the Laurentians than in Quebec for the 2013-2017 period.

"Lyme disease is growing steadily in southern Quebec," says Lemieux-Côté. According to him, the increase in the number of cases can be explained by several factors. First, she says, "the presence of ticks in Laurentian territory seems to be increasing over the years." Birds that carry more and more ticks from endemic areas that are expanding would be the main culprits.

The fact that the general population and clinicians are more aware of this emerging disease also leads to more medical consultations and more prescriptions for diagnostic tests for the disease. "The diagnostic criteria and the case definitions are becoming more precise, which makes it possible to obtain confirmed cases for our region," added Ms. Lemieux-Côté.

[Quebec is a province in eastern Canada. Laurentides, with a population of 555 614 residents in 2011, is one of 17 administrative regions in Quebec. A map of Quebec regions can be found at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_regions_of_Quebec. Laurentides includes part of the Laurentian Mountain Range, which is a popular summer and winter tourist destination, with lake cottages culture in the summer, and skiing in the winter (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurentides). The Laurentian Range extends across the U.S. border to the south, to the Adirondack Mountains in New York State, where Lyme disease is endemic.

Factors that could account for an increase in Lyme disease incidence in Laurentides include climate change, growth of suburban neighborhoods into surrounding wooded areas, and enlarging populations of deer, white-footed mice and other small rodents, and _Borrelia burgdorferi_-infected nymphal _Ixodes scapularis_. Nymphal _I. scapularis_ are the primary tick vector for Lyme disease in northeastern US and southeastern Canada. Deer, although not susceptible to Lyme disease, supply the adult tick with a required blood meal; white-footed mice and other small rodents are the primary reservoirs for Lyme disease.
