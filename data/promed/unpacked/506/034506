Ipanema (Minas Gerais) adopts measures against leishmaniasis
-----------------------------------------
The number of cases of visceral leishmaniasis in humans confirmed in
Ipanema [Minas Gerais] from September to January 2010 has now increased to 6.

There were 3 cases in Pedreira, 2 immediately in the neighborhood,
and one case in Vila Vicentina. Proportionately, compared to the
number of the population, the rate is considered high, and this is an
exotic disease in the region. The reality of the disease in Ipanema
is considered an outbreak. The fact is not alarming, but requires
more care, especially from the population, to prevent the disease
from spreading.

The nurse and coordinator of the Epidemiological Surveillance of
Ipanema, Rodrigo Soares de Oliveira Fialho, explains that a number of
measures to combat the disease are being affected by the City through
the Department of Health. Health officials are spraying all the
houses. "Another measure was the training of doctors here to take the
cases of the disease." Only when the situation is serious are
patients referred for treatment in Belo Horizonte.

Another action that has been done is the canine survey. Health
workers go from house to house collecting blood from the tip of the
ears of dogs, as these animals can be carriers of leishmaniasis. Then
the tests are sent to the Ezequiel Dias Foundation (Funed), in Belo
Horizonte. When the results arrive and there is confirmation of the
disease, the animal must be sacrificed.

For the canine survey to date, 450 samples were sent on average. Of
this total, there are 304 results, with 27 confirmed cases in the
animals and one indeterminate. The goal of the survey is around 2000
animals, based on the number of anti-rabies vaccinations.

Rodrigo emphasized that in cases of diseases such as this,
responsibility also falls on the state government, which pledged to
provide funds for the construction of a kennel and for the purchase
of a van to transport the animals collected.

However, the delay by the state to build the kennel makes the
gathering and sacrifice of these animals [difficult]. Thus, "[a
kennel] was improvised for animals with confirmed leishmaniasis,
where cases are brought and killed," explained veterinarians Marcelus
Jannuzzo and Oliveira. As for stray dogs, a state law ensures that
these animals are collected and sent to be sacrificed.

Meanwhile, the municipal government and people must act together. "It
is very important that residents do their part, maintaining and
cleaning chicken yards, because feces and dried leaves are natural
shelter for the mosquito that transmits the disease," emphasizes the
coordinator of the Center for Epidemiology.

The transmission of leishmaniasis occurs through small mosquitoes
that feed on blood. They are most commonly found in humid, dark areas
with many plants. Poultry houses, locations close to the forest, and
dogs can also be havens for the parasite.

Symptoms of visceral leishmaniasis are irregular fever, anemia,
malaise, pallor of skin and mucous membranes, weight loss, and
abdominal swelling due to enlarged liver and spleen.
