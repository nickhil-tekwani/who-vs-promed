5 more cases of _E. coli_ linked to dairy's raw milk
-----------------------------------------------
Interviews with consumers of raw milk from Dee Creek Farm have turned up 5
more people sickened with _E. coli_ (O157), public health officials said
Sat 17 Dec 2005.
The new cases bring the total sickened to 17 people, including 2 children
still in critical condition. None of the cases -- announced Sat 17 Dec 2005
and discovered in 3 children and 2 adults -- required hospitalization,
officials said.
A Cowlitz County judge had ordered farmers Anita and Michael Puckett to
turn over the names of 45 families who obtained raw, or unpasteurized, milk
from the Woodland farm.
State laboratory results showed a bacterial DNA match between the 1st
confirmed case of _E. coli_ and 3 other cases, said Marni Storey, Clark
County's public health manager. That match proves the cases are linked and
also points to Dee Creek Farm as the source of the outbreak, Storey said.
"100 percent of the people with _E. coli_ reported consuming unpasteurized
milk from Dee Creek dairy," Storey said. "There's a very strong association
between the milk and these illnesses."
Summer Steenbarger, the Pucketts' daughter, said Thu 15 Dec 2005 that 3
farm workers sought medical attention for diarrhea at the time the _E.
coli_ cases began to surface but said their symptoms were not severe enough
to warrant testing. In August 2005, the Washington Department of
Agriculture ordered Dee Creek Farm to stop selling raw milk because it did
not have a license, but the Pucketts denied selling raw milk. They were,
however, continuing to distribute raw milk through a system of shared
ownership in cows housed at the farm.
Cow-sharing arrangements are not illegal, state agricultural officials have
said, but they cannot be used as a loophole to laws that ban distribution
of raw milk without a license. Steenbarger, who has said the farm now plans
to seek a license, said Dee Creek's milk has tested clean 3 times in recent
weeks. She suggested that consumers of the milk were somehow responsible
for their condition and that the cases occurred coincidentally.
On Sat 17 Dec 2005, Storey did not assert an absolute link between the milk
and the _E. coli_ cases based on the DNA tests. She said further lab
results are expected next week. Of the 2 children still in critical
condition, Storey said one was still on life support and the other's health
was improving slightly. She declined to reveal where the children are
hospitalized, citing privacy concerns.

21 possible cases of _E.coli_ reported
-------------------------------------------
The number of suspected or confirmed _E. coli_ (O157) cases now stands at
21, after health officials gained access Fri 16 Dec 2005 to the Dee Creek
Farm's customer list. The farm owners, Anita and Michael Puckett of
Woodland, turned the list over at 10:29 p.m. on Thursday [15 Dec 2005].
Cowlitz County obtained a court order Thursday afternoon giving the family
24 hours to release the names of the people who drank the unpasteurized, or
raw, milk the farm produces.
45 families -- including the Pucketts -- were on the list. The families,
called co-owners by the Pucketts, live in Cowlitz and Clark counties in
Washington and Clatsop, Multnomah and Wasco counties in Oregon. Local
health officials spent the day contacting the families in their counties,
and 7 new suspected cases were discovered, 4 in Cowlitz County and 3 in
Clark County. Suspected cases mean a person drank the suspect milk and has
symptoms but has not yet been tested.
Also Fri 16 Dec 2005, a new confirmed case was announced in Clark County,
bringing the number of confirmed or suspected cases in that county to 11.
Cowlitz County has 7 suspected or confirmed cases, and 3 people in Clatsop
County are being tested.
Of the 5 Clark County children hospitalized with _E. coli_, 2 remain in the
hospital. One of those was said to be improving, according to Clark County.
Both were still listed as being in critical condition, and Clark County
Health Department officials said they did not know whether the children
were still on life support.
Health officials will continue contacting any families they couldn't reach
on Fri 16 Dec 2005 during the weekend.

FDA warns consumers to avoid drinking raw milk
-----------------------------------------------
Following an outbreak in the state of Washington, the FDA is warning the
public against drinking raw milk, because it may contain harmful bacteria
that can cause life-threatening illnesses. Raw milk is not treated or
pasteurized to destroy disease-causing bacteria.
The risk of drinking raw milk was most recently demonstrated in Washington
State by an outbreak associated with raw milk containing the bacteria
called _Escherichia coli_ O157:H7 (_E. coli_). To date, 8 illness have been
reported in Washington State, several of which were in children. 2 of the
children remain hospitalized. Health authorities have identified locally
sold raw milk as a source of the outbreak and have ordered the unlicensed
dairy to shut down.
According to the CDC, more than 300 people in the USA became ill by
drinking raw milk or eating cheese made from raw milk in 2001, and nearly
200 became ill from these products in 2002.
Symptoms of _E. coli_ O157:H7 illness include stomach cramps and diarrhea,
including bloody diarrhea. _E. coli_ O157:H7 disease sometimes leads to a
serious complication called hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), which can
cause kidney failure. People typically become ill 2 to 5 days after eating
contaminated food. People who have developed those symptoms after consuming
unpasteurized milk should seek immediate medical attention.
Pasteurization is the only effective method for eliminating the bacteria in
raw milk and milk products. Pasteurization uses heat applied for a length
of time sufficient to destroy harmful bacteria, such as _E. coli_ O157:H7,
without significantly changing milk's nutritional value. There is no
meaningful difference in the nutritional value of pasteurized and
unpasteurized milk. Pasteurization can also prevent such contagious
diseases as tuberculosis, diphtheria, polio, Q fever, salmonellosis, strep
throat, scarlet fever, and typhoid fever that can be spread by bacteria in
milk. All milk shipped between states is required, by law, to be pasteurized.

[Analysis of all the isolated strains can confirm a common source. It would
be preferred that an isolate showing the same identity be found at the
dairy, but the epidemiology revealing that all primary cases had ingested
the unpasteurized milk certainly is convincing evidence. - Mod.LL]
