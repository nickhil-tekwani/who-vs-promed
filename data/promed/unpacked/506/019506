On Fri 9 Jan 2015, the community said the victims included 5 children, 3 men, and 5 women. Saturday Independent gathered that the epidemic occurred between the Christmas Eve [24 Dec 2014] and 2 Jan 2015. It was said to have caused panic among the people of Igbomotoru and neighboring communities.

Investigations showed that communities in the area do not have any functional health facility and potable water. The people of the area travel an average of one and half hours to seek medical attention in Yenagoa, the state capital. The Bayelsa State government confirmed the incident through the Ministry of Health. An official of the ministry, who did not want to be named, said government had dispatched a medical team to Igbomotoru II to intervene.
