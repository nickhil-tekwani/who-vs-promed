--------------------------------------------------------------
This is in response to the posting above with news of an HPAI outbreak
among wild birds in Arkhangai aimag in Mongolia.

The Moderator's comment states that no species identification was available
on the outbreak among wild migratory birds in Qinghai that was reported to
OIE on 17 May 2009. I am forwarding a report that was posted through the
MOA news agency, reporting on the identity of the species involved [The
Chinese Ministry of Agriculture's (MOA) report, kindly forwarded by Dr
Gilbert, includes the following information: "As of 16 May 2009, a total
number of 121 wild birds have died, including 107 great crested grebe, 3
bar-headed geese, and 11 brown-headed gulls". - Mod.AS]

Also, my understanding is that as yet there has been no confirmation that
the Arkhangai mortality is definitively related to HPAI H5N1. Samples have
been collected from birds affected and at least one has tested positive for
H5. Samples have been forwarded to Hokkaido University for further
sub-typing [see comment below].

One other addition to the moderator's comments: it is worth noting that (if
confirmed) this would actually be the 3rd time that Mongolian wild bird
outbreaks of HPAI have followed outbreaks in Qinghai, since this occurred
in 2006 as well.

Links to the 2006 reports through OIE are given below
1. <http://www.oie.int/eng/info/hebdo/AIS_16.HTM#Sec8> [Immediate
notification report, received 30 May 2006, pertaining to HPAI H5N1 positive
laboratory test results of a whooper swan found in a lake, detected as part
of the active surveillance in wild birds. The laboratory confirmation was
obtained on 4 May 2006. The following comment was included: "Active
surveillance has been implemented in the western and central parts of
Mongolia following the main flyways of migratory birds. A total of 182
samples have been collected from birds belonging to 27 different wild
species. Surveillance in the eastern part of the country is in progress."]
2. <http://www.oie.int/eng/info/hebdo/AIS_07.HTM#Sec9> [Follow-up report
no. 1, received 28 July 2006, on 12 migratory birds (gull, swan, goose).]

[The Chinese reports on the 2006 cases (3 clusters) in wild birds,
including a map, are available at

[We are grateful to Dr Gilbert for the valuable complementary information
above.

His information on the diagnosis of the current event, stating that the
dead bird(s) have tested positive for H5 (while H5N1 confirmation is
pending), is correct. According to information received by the OIE on 28
May 2009 from Mr Doloojin Orgil, director, Ministry of Food and
Agriculture, Department of Veterinary Services, Ulan Bator, Mongolia, 9
migratory swans were found dead and one destroyed in Arkhangai (Doitiin
tsagaan Lake, Ugii-nuur soum). The Central Veterinary Laboratory (national
laboratory) confirmed H5. See, with map, at
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=8141>.

A final diagnosis of these birds is anticipated. In case H5N1 positive, it
would be interesting to compare the Qinghai (Chinese) and Mongolian
genotypes. - Mod.AS]
