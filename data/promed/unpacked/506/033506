One person has been confirmed dead and 5 others are lying critically ill in 2 hospitals following the outbreak of Lassa fever in Plateau State.

Confirming the outbreak and the death of one victim, the deputy director of epidemiology in the State Ministry of Health, Dr Raymond Juryit, said there are cases of suspected Lassa fever in the state and 4 of the infected people are being treated at the Bingham University Teaching Hospital (BUTH), Jos, while one other is hospitalised at a hospital in Jingri, Bassa local government area of the state. He also confirmed that one person died of the fever at BUTH.

Juryit also said that the state government was taking necessary measures to prevent a spread of the outbreak and had already taken specimens for confirmation.

[Lassa fever virus is endemic in Nigeria and there were cases of the disease in Plateau state in January 2013 (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20130131.1524034). As Mod.CP pointed out in his comment in that archived report, "In the countries of Africa, such as Nigeria, where Lassa fever is endemic, the disease is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. While Lassa fever infection is normally mild or has no observable symptoms in about 80 per cent of people infected with the virus, the remaining 20 per cent have a severe multi-system disease. Exceptionally, Lassa fever is associated with epidemics, during which the case-fatality rate can reach 50 per cent. There is no preventative vaccine and treatment. The antiviral drug ribavirin has been used with success in Lassa fever patients."

The virus is a member of the family _Arenaviridae_ and causes acute hemorrhagic fever. It is transmitted to humans from contacts with food or household items contaminated with excreta of multimammate rats (_Mastomys_ spp). Virus transmission can occur in houses or in hospital environments or laboratories in the absence of adequate infection control measures.
