Yesterday I was able to speak with Dr. Thurmond Reitz, Assistant State
Veterinarian, Albuquerque, who had visited the affected ranch at Wagon
Mounds and spoken with the owners.
It seems that the owners, two brothers, had brought up some unvaccinated
cattle from a second ranch. These had only been on the ranch, where there
is very extensive grazing, for some ten days when two were noticed to be
ill. Certainly one died and was confirmed to have had anthrax. It/they
was/were buried on the ranch.
It was immediately arranged to have all the newly introduced animals
vaccinated as well as all the stock on the other ranch. They have been
strongly advised to continue the vaccination for at least five years, which
means, with luck, they will do it for three, which is what we recommend.
The ranches are under quarantine until the initial vaccination has been
completed.
Thurmond had only just arrived in Albuquerque having been transferred from
West Texas where he has had plenty of experience with this disease. He was
unable to get any clear answers to his questions as to whether there had
been any bull dozing or other earth moving activities, or other normally
related incidents. The brothers were paying more attention to running the
cattle through the shoot and vaccinating them. A second visit is planned.
The weather has been relatively mild though with nights around freezing.
The puzzle is that before the outbreak this summer, the last reported
anthrax case on the farm had been in 1952.
This ranch is very large. For these animals to come down within ten days
means that they found something attractive and contaminated within a day or
two of arriving and somewhere where they didn't really have to search for
it. At the previous outbreak the final (index) case was landfilled; the
previous five dead cattle were left on the farm somewhere and maybe it was
the remains of one of them or the contaminated soil at the death site that
caused the trouble this time. Only getting advice after five animals had
died suggests that sporadic deaths went routinely uninvestigated.
