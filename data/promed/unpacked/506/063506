[This report summarizes 6 outbreaks in both commercial and backyard
poultry. Unfortunately, they are spread out across different parts of
the country. These outbreaks are due to a highly pathogenic Avian
Influenza H5N1 virus and this is the 3rd Update Report in 2011. Given
that the outbreak started in 2007, it appears as if it will be some
time before it is cleaned up completely, so we should all not forget
that H5N1 is still circulating in Southeast Asia and Egypt.

The location of these outbreaks can be seen appended to the OIE WAHID
report referenced above or at the HealthMap site
<http://healthmap.org/r/00t_>.
A summary and very crowded map can also seen at the OIE website at
