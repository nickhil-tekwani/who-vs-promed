The Perak Japanese Encephalitis [should now be called Nipah Virus
Encephalitis - Mod. CYC] operations room has been placed on standby for the
possibility of a fresh outbreak of the disease following the latest case of
Nipah virus infection in a pig farm outside the high-risk area recently.
State Agriculture Committee chairman Datuk Ramly Zahari said today the task
force on the pig cull had been dispatched to help the farms with pigs that
had been tested positive for the virus.
"According to the original schedule, we should have closed the operations
room because all the pigs to be culled have been put down. However, the
emergence of new cases in several areas outside the high-risk areas makes
it necessary for us to be always prepared, including to destroy pigs turned
over by panicky farmers," he said.
Yesterday, [some] of the 3,000 pigs in two farms in Chemor, near [Ipoh],
and a farm in Ayer Kuning, Batang Padang, were confirmed to be infected
with the Nipah virus [i.e., shown to have on the premises pigs with
antibody to Nipah virus - Mod.CC].
