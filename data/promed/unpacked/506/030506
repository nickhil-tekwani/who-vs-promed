Wildlife managers have documented chronic wasting disease (CWD) in a new swath of the Green River basin.

The Wyoming Game and Fish Department sent out a news release Wednesday [20 Jan 2021] announcing a positive hit for the prion disease in a mule deer buck found dead in deer hunt area 138. That 1628-square-mile zone stretches from the headwaters of Boulder Creek at the Continental Divide, down to the sagebrush-steppe landscape that terminates at Fontenelle Reservoir.

The arrival of the incurable, lethal disease to the southwest slope of the Wind River Range is not a surprise. CWD was confirmed in deer hunt area 139, just to the north, in 2017, when the neurological disorder was discovered in a dead mule deer doe found at a property near the Pinedale Airport. Over the crest of the Winds, it has also been documented in adjoining deer hunt area 171 since 2015.

Chronic wasting disease first showed up in deer on the far west side of the state, but recently it is also being detected in elk in the region. In December [2020], a hunter-killed cow elk shot north of Dubois tested positive in elk unit 67, a zone overlaying deer hunt area 128, where CWD was detected 5 years ago.

A hunter also killed a CWD-positive cow elk in Grand Teton National Park, unit 75, this past fall [2020], an indication the disease is likely now present in the herd gathered on the National Elk Refuge.

In mule deer, CWD has also been found in units 142, 145 and 152, areas encompassing parts of the southern Gros Ventre Range, the northern Salt River and Wyoming ranges, and the west side of the Green River Basin.

CWD is a variant of mad cow disease, which has crossed over from domestic cattle to humans, causing Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Public health experts advise hunters to not eat meat from infected animals.

Free testing is available through the Wyoming Game and Fish Department. In 2020, the state agency processed 6300 samples to screen for CWD.

[An interactive map of the various zones of deer hunting, elk hunting, etc. and positive zones may be found at https://wgfd.wyo.gov/Hunting/Hunt-Planner/Elk-Hunting/Elk-Map. This is an interactive map allowing you to layer different zones of elk or deer or both where CWD has been found.

Another helpful website is https://www.gaiagps.com/hunting/wyoming/, which shows public vs private land for hunting and where the zones are. This site may also have an app associated with it for downloading.

Chronic wasting disease seems to be spreading in Wyoming. The winter-feeding grounds are a concern. Biologist, hunters, regulatory individuals and the general public are all concerned about the feeding grounds and impact on the animals, as well as on tourists who come to the area to see these magnificent creatures.
