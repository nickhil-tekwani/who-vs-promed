An Amador County man died this week after contracting rabies from a bat.
The victim became ill 15 Sep 2000 and was admitted to Sutter Amador
Hospital the next day. A doctor there suspected the victim had contracted
rabies and isolated him before he was transferred to a hospital in
Sacramento the following day.
The California Department of Health Services on Tuesday confirmed the
rabies diagnosis, and the victim died Wednesday afternoon. He was the
state's first rabies fatality since 1995.
Dr. Robert Hartmann, Amador County's public-health officer, said the
victim's strain of rabies originated in a Mexican freetail bat, the most
commonly found bat in California.
The circumstances surrounding the victim's bite remain unknown, Hartmann
said. The county's Environmental Health and Animal Control departments are
investigating his workplace and home. Ken August, a state Health Services
Department spokesman, said it's
likely the victim was bitten by a bat, but just because the strain of
rabies originated in a bat doesn't make that a certainty. "It could be that
another animal, such as a cat, had been infected by a bat and the cat could
have bitten him," August said.
This victim's death was the first attributed to rabies in California
since 1995, when 2 people died after contracting the disease. Only about
1 to 3 rabies cases each year are reported in the United States.
Rabies is transmitted by a virus in wild and domestic animals, the most
common of which are bats and skunks. Once a person exhibits rabies
symptoms -- headache, difficulty swallowing, an aversion to water
[because they cannot swallow], anxiety, agitation and confusion and
convulsions are among them -- the disease is always fatal. However, a
specific treatment regimen including a series of shots can prevent
problems if a person exposed has yet to exhibit symptoms.
Casual contact with an infected person will not spread the disease,
Hartmann said. There never has been a documented case of human-to-human
transmission of rabies, except during corneal transplants.
The risk to family members, hospital employees, doctors and co-workers
who had contact with the deceased is quite low, Hartmann said. However,
since the rabies virus is present in some human tissues and fluids, the
risk is considered theoretically possible. Those who could have been
exposed to the virus are undergoing assessments and counseling to
determine their risk and if they should undergo post-exposure treatments,
Hartmann said.
