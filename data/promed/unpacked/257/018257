Secretary Francisco Esparza Parada reported that cases of seasonal influenza in Aguascalientes increased by 565 per cent during 2016, when so far, 306 cases have been registered compared with 46 in the same period last year [2015].

The secretary also reported that 404 411 cases of acute respiratory infections have been registered, compared with 358 241 cases reported during the same period of [2015], that is, nearly 13 per cent higher."

On the increase in cases, the state official said that "the cause could be early onset of temperature changes; we are already in the 3rd cold front." He recommended, "care for children younger than 5, keep them warm, drink enough liquids, hot liquids and include fruits and vegetables in the diet." He also said it is important "not to visit places where there are large gatherings if you already have symptoms and seek prompt medical attention," and further stated that "so far there have been no deaths."

With regard to vaccination against influenza, the secretary said that vaccination will begin on 30 Oct 2016 not on 15 Oct 2016, due to a delay in delivery of the vaccine.

It is worth mentioning that about 340 000 doses of vaccines will arrive in the next days, which is expected to cover the high risk groups, that is, "children under 5 years of age, pregnant women, health care personnel in contact with patients, elderly people, and people who have illnesses that cause immune suppression."

Finally he noted that this condition causes "malaise, fever, cough, bronchial congestion" and urged that "in case of illness, instead of self-medication, people should report to health facilities."

[The surge in Influenza cases seems to be coinciding with cooler temperature changes in the country. Also the delay in availability of seasonal vaccine may compound the situation further. That being stated, awareness of an early surge in influenza activity can be used to provide public awareness messages for preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, cough etiquette, and reporting to physicians in time if the symptoms develop. - Mod.UBA
