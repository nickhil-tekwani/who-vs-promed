Ukraine Region Declared Disaster
---------------------------------
KIEV, Ukraine (AP) -- President Leonid Kuchma on Thursday declared 4
southern Ukrainian villages an ecological disaster zone, following an
outbreak of a mysterious illness some have blamed on leaks of Soviet-era
rocket fuel.
About 400 residents of the villages near Mykolaiv, 320 miles south of the
capital Kiev, have been reported sick since 4 Jul 2000, but only a few new
cases were registered this week, Health Minister Vitaliy Moskalenko said.
Health officials were checking nearly 6 000 residents of nearby villages
for signs of the illness, a chemical poisoning [it is not established on
the basis of this and the next report that the illness is due to chemical
exposure -Man. Ed. DS] that causes skin rashes and affects the liver and
pancreas, he told a state investigative commission.
High concentrations of nitrates have been found in 57 percent of drinking
water supplied through a pipe system, 98 percent of water from wells and
every tenth food product checked, Moskalenko said in comments cited by the
Interfax news agency.
Officials said Ukraine would appeal to the World Health Organization and
foreign governments to help it deal with the emergency. The government,
meanwhile, appeared split on what caused the illness, with some officials
blaming rocket fuel and others denying the possibility. In the region is a
base holding solid-fuel SS-24 nuclear missiles, which are to be dismantled
in 2001. It once housed other Soviet missiles powered by liquid fuel.
Health experts have said the area's soil and water contained substances
that are usually produced by decomposing rocket fuel, but Kuchma's
spokesman Oleksandr Martynenko insisted on Wednesday that rocket fuel could
not be blamed. Instead, he suggested that the illness could have resulted
from high amounts of nitrates in the soil. But the head of the government
commission, deputy premier Mykola Zhulynskyi, said missile silos in the
area had remained open after liquid-fuel rockets were dismantled there in
the late 1970s. Fuel spills could have occurred during the missiles'
dismantling, he said. Ukraine inherited 46 SS-24 and 130 SS-19 nuclear
missiles following the 1991 Soviet collapse. Kiev has since surrendered all
its nuclear warheads to Russia and eliminated the last SS-19 missile in
1999. Most of the SS-24s along with missile silos remain to be destroyed
under a disarmament plan running through 2001.

Causes of epidemic in Ukraine need investigation
---------------------------------------------------
KIEV, August 31 (Itar-Tass) - Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma asked
Russian President Vladimir Putin's assistance in investigating the causes
of the incidence of toxicodermatitis in 4 villages of Ukraine's Nikolayev
region. In the letter to the Russian president, Kuchma asked him to call
appropriate Russian structures for information about the burial in 1991 in
Ukraine of military equipment and radioactive and chemical waste. Kuchma
also sees the need for consultations of experts of the 2 countries on these
matters, the Ukrainian president's press service reported to Tass on Thursday.
A special governmental commission to investigate the causes of the epidemic
has been working in the territory of the Nikolayev region for several days.
As many as 410 people, 240 of them children, have been hospitalized because
of the disease.
In the letter to Putin, Kuchma deplores the fact that Ukraine lacks
information about such dumps, specifically about the burials of radioactive
and chemical waste that pose ecological hazard.
