Third Human Case of West Nile Virus Infection Confirmed in Massachusetts
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Massachusetts Department of Public Health announced today the third
confirmed case of West Nile virus (WNV) human infection in Massachusetts. A
72-year-old man from Dartmouth was confirmed to have encephalitis caused by
a West Nile virus infection. He is recovering in a Southeastern
Massachusetts hospital following admission on Thu 8 Nov 2001 with symptoms
of fever, muscle weakness and encephalitis. His illness began on Mon 5 Nov
2001, which would indicate infection occurring on or about 22 Oct 2001.

The previously announced cases were a 70-year-old male from Woburn who
developed symptoms of encephalitis in late September and died in October.
The other case was an 89 year-old man from Acushnet, who had an onset of
illness in mid October and remains hospitalized in stable condition.

The case in Massachusetts reported today brings the total reported human
cases of WNV disease this year in the United States to 47. In addition to
the 3 cases reported in Massachusetts, the number of West Nile encephalitis
cases reported by state has been Connecticut, 6; New York, 12; New Jersey,
6; Pennsylvania, 3; Maryland, 6; Georgia, 1 and Florida, 10. Three of the
reported West Nile encephalitis cases were fatal [see comment below.

The State Laboratory identified 37 WNV positive horse cases, with onsets
between 28 Aug and 16 Oct 2001. The laboratory also detected WNV in 1102
dead birds and in 25 pools of mosquitoes. Information about WNV and
cumulative reports of virus activity in mosquitoes, birds, and horses during
2001 can be found on the MDPH WNV website at .

[These figures differ from those reported in the most recent MMWR update
(see: West Nile virus surveillance 2001 - USA (34) 20011130.2914). The MMWR
update states that as of 20 Nov 2201, a total of 48 human cases of WNV
encephalitis or meningitis have been reported in New York (12), Florida
(10), New Jersey (7), Connecticut (6), Maryland (6), Pennsylvania (3),
Massachusetts (2), Georgia (1), and Louisiana (1). Among these 48 cases, 27
(56 per cent) were males (median age 70 years; range: 36 to 90); dates of
illness onset ranged from 13 Jul to 15 Oct 2001; and 5 patients (10 per
cent) died. The third case of WNV infection in Massachusetts reported above
brings the total number of human cases to at least 49. - Mod.CP
