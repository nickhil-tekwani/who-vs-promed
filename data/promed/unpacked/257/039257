The final sentence in the commentary to the above posting included errors. The correct text should read as follows:

According to the website of the FMD World Reference Laboratory at Pirbright, Pakistan submitted in December 2015 (35) samples to the World Reference Laboratory (batch no. WRLFMD/2015/00037; Date received: 17 Dec 2015; see at http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/asia/pak.htm). The results of their serotyping and genotyping are anticipated with interest. In case the recent Pakistani samples do not include 1 or both of the said strains, the route(s) of their spread westwards remain to be unraveled.
