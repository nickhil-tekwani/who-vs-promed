Malaria returns to Kerala
-------------------------
Malaria, which made a comeback in Kerala after it was officially
eradicated several years ago, has been causing deep concern for the
people and health authorities in Thrissur district.

In the district, so far 82 cases of malaria have been reported this
year [2010]. Last year [2009], 154 instances of malaria attack were reported.

Of the 82 cases this year [2010], 77 cases were due to _Plasmodium
vivax_ infection; one due to _P. falciparum_, and 4 due to mixed
infections. 7 of last year's [2009] 154 cases were caused by _P.
falciparum_. While _P. vivax_ is less dangerous than _P. falciparum_
infection can be fatal.

Thrissur district in the past had a decent health record, but the
situation has changed drastically now in spite of the fact that
healthcare facilities have improved remarkably. The outbreak of
infections and emergence of eradicated diseases such as malaria are
particularly worrying.

District medical officer [DMO] AS Surendran told The Hindu that most
of the malaria cases identified in the district were among migrant
labourers, mainly from north Indian States of Orissa, Bihar, and West
Bengal. Some persons who had been working outside the State also come
for treatment after they were infected by the disease, he added.

"No indigenous spreading has been reported so far in the district
this year [2010]," he said. He does not rule out chances for it,
though. Resurgence of malaria in the State, which claims high health
standards, poses a real challenge for the Health Department.

"The Health Department conducts screening test for malaria among the
migrant labourers as soon as they arrive at their work sites," Dr
Surendran said. Block health inspectors have been asked to monitor
construction sites and building contractors were asked to report to
the health centres as soon as new workers arrived, the DMO said.

"Regular health camps have been conducted at the places where there
is sizeable number of migrant labourers. Blood smears have been
collected and drugs administered as soon as symptoms are found."

As most of the construction workers stay in the makeshift sheds near
the worksites, they are more susceptible to attack of mosquitoes,
which are the disease carrying vectors. Malaria is a parasitic
disease that involves high fevers, shaking chills, flu-like symptoms,
and anaemia.

Viral fever cases
-----------------
The district also reported a spurt in the number of viral fever
cases, which were common during the monsoon season. Recently, about
850 trainees at the Kerala Police Academy were administered drugs for
swine flu [A (H1N1)], as many of them started showing flu-like symptoms.

Among the random samples collected from 16 trainees, 8 were reported
positive for A (H1N1) influenza. So far 133 swine flu cases were
confirmed in the district.

Healthcare professionals say stern steps are necessary to revive
Thrissur's past healthy profile. For this, they said, the cooperation
of the public was necessary.

[82 cases of malaria have been reported over the 1st 6 months of 2010
compared to 154 for the entire 2009. This is not a major difference,
and the situation looks more like a stable, low level transmission.
This is underlined by only one _P. falciparum_ case detected in 2010
compared to 7 for the whole of 2009, which is a decline. The number
of malaria cases is still very limited out of a population of 31
million (<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerala>).

Transmission of H1N1 is expected and there is no indication whether
it is increasing based on just a few confirmed cases. - Mod.EP]
