Outbreak brief 12: Sudan virus disease in Uganda
------------------------------------------------
Outbreak update: Since the last brief (7 Dec 2022), no new confirmed cases and deaths of Sudan virus disease (SVD) were reported from Uganda. The last confirmed case was reported on 27 Nov 2022; this makes 16 days since the last reported confirmed case.

Cumulatively, 142 confirmed cases and 55 confirmed deaths (CFR: 39%) were reported from 9 health districts: Bunyangabu (1 cases; 0 deaths), Jinja (1; 1), Kagadi (1; 1), Kampala (18; 2), Kassanda (49; 21), Kyegegwa (4; 1), Masaka (1; 1), Mubende (64; 281), and Wakiso (3; 0) (see table 1 [at the source URL above]). No new recoveries were reported since the last brief. Cumulatively, 871 recoveries have been registered. Healthcare workers account for 13% (19) of the cases and 13% (7) of all deaths (CFR: 37%).

Note: A total of 22 probable deaths were reported and are not included in the total count. These include 21 probable deaths that occurred in Mubende (19) and Kassanda (2) districts prior to the declaration of the outbreak. An additional probable death was identified from Kassanda district on 8 Oct 2022 and is also not included in the total case/death count.

[2] Lockdown lifted

Uganda on [Sat 17 Dec 2022] lifted a 2-month lockdown on 2 districts at the epicenter of the country's Ebola epidemic, amid cautious hope that the outbreak could end soon.

Since authorities declared an Ebola outbreak 20 Sep 2022, the East African nation has registered 142 confirmed cases and 56 deaths, with the disease spreading to the capital, Kampala.

The 2 central districts at the heart of the outbreak, Mubende and Kassanda, were placed under lockdown by President Yoweri Museveni on 15 Oct 2022.

But on Saturday [17 Dec 2022], Vice President Jessica Alupo announced that the government was "lifting all movement restrictions and curfew in Mubende and Kassanda districts with immediate effect."

The 2 hotspots were under a dusk-to-dawn curfew, with markets, bars, and churches closed as well as personal travel banned.

"The lifting of the restrictions is based on the fact that currently there is currently no transmission, no contact under follow-up, no patients in the isolation facilities, and we are progressing well," Alupo said in a televised address delivered on behalf of Museveni.

Ugandan authorities said last month that new cases were falling, and the last confirmed patient with the disease was discharged from hospital 30 Nov 2022.

Alupa warned however that the government remained on "high alert" for any resurgence in cases.

The announcement came after local leaders in the 2 districts appealed last month [November 2022] for the lockdown to be lifted and implored the central government to provide aid to citizens hit hard by the curbs on business.

The outbreak has been caused by the Sudan strain of the virus, for which there is currently no vaccine.

Uganda earlier this month [December 2022] received its 1st shipment of trial vaccines against the Sudan strain, with more doses expected in the coming weeks.

They will be used in a so-called ring vaccination trial, where all contacts of confirmed Ebola patients, and contacts of contacts, are jabbed along with frontline and health workers.

However, the absence of active Ebola cases in recent days has held up the vaccine trials, according to international health experts working in Uganda.

According to the World Health Organization, an outbreak of the disease ends when there are no new cases for 42 consecutive days -- twice the incubation period of Ebola.

Ebola spreads through bodily fluids. Common symptoms are fever, vomiting, bleeding, and diarrhea. Outbreaks are difficult to contain, especially in urban environments.

All Ebola-related travel restrictions were also relaxed on Sat 17 Dec 2022 by President Yoweri Museveni. "Museveni lifted restrictions on the disease's epicentres in Mubende, which had 66 cases and 29 deaths, and Kassanda, which had 49 cases and 21 deaths."
(https://www.eastcoastdaily.in/2022/12/18/ugandas-president-lifts-every-ebola-related-travel-restrictions.html)

The spread of the virus has slowed dramatically, if not stopped altogether, but the Ebola spillover risk is still high.

"Several years ago, a team of scientists at Lehigh University in the US developed a predictive model to accurately forecast Ebola outbreaks based on climate-driven bat migration.

"Ebola is a serious and sometimes deadly infectious disease that is zoonotic or enters a human population via interaction with animals.

"Now, members of the team have examined how social and economic factors, such as level of education and general knowledge of Ebola, might contribute to "high-risk behaviours" that may bring individuals into contact with potentially infected animals.

"A focus on geographical locations with high concentrations of individuals at high-risk could help public health officials better target prevention and education resources.

"We created a survey that combined the collection of social, demographic, and economic data with questions related to general knowledge of Ebola transmission and potentially high-risk behaviors," says Paolo Bocchini, professor of civil and environmental engineering at Lehigh and one of the study's leaders.

"The results are detailed in a paper which will soon be published in PLOS ONE. Young adults (ages between 18-34) and adults (ages between 34-50) were most at risk in the population they studied.

"We confirmed a relationship between social, economic, and demographic factors and the propensity for individuals to engage in behaviours that expose them to Ebola spillover," says Bocchini. "We also calibrated a preliminary model that quantifies this relationship."

The authors say these results point to the need for a holistic approach for any model seeking to accurately predict disease outbreaks.

Their findings may also be useful for population health officials, who may be able to use such models to better focus scarce resources." (https://www.socialnews.xyz/2022/12/17/sudden-ebola-outbreak-on-the-wane-but-spillover-is-still-a-high-risk/)

[3] New bivalent vaccine
Date: Sat 17 Dec 2022
Source: Digital Journal [edited]
https://www.digitaljournal.com/tech-science/rapid-deployment-of-new-bivalent-ebola-vaccine-to-uganda/article


More than 40 000 doses of Oxford University's Ebola vaccine (from the Oxford Vaccine Group) have been manufactured by the SII (Serum Institute of India) in just 60 days and the doses have been shipped to Uganda. The bivalent vaccine, named ChAdOx1 biEBOV, is designed to target both major strains of Ebolavirus.

Ebola virus disease (formerly known as Ebola haemorrhagic fever) is a rare but severe, often fatal, often fatal illness, with a death rate of up to 90 percent in humans caused by the Ebola virus, a member of the filovirus family. A bivalent vaccine is one that works by stimulating an immune response against 2 different antigens, such as 2 different viruses or other microorganisms.

The Ugandan outbreak began in early September [2022] in Mubende, about 80 kilometers [about 50 miles] from the capital Kampala and this region remains at the epicentre.

The rapid response has been a part of international plans to develop globally accessible vaccines against new threats in just 100 days and is delivered in partnership with the World Health Organisation (WHO).

Since the outbreak declaration on 20 Sep 2022, to 5 Dec 2022, a total of 142 confirmed cases have been reported by the Uganda Ministry of Health. The origin of the virus is a strain prevalent in Sudan.

The shipment to Uganda comes just 80 days after WHO declared a Sudan ebolavirus outbreak. Following a presentation of key data to the WHO, the new vaccine was recommended for inclusion in a WHO-run ring vaccination trial to combat a Sudan ebolavirus outbreak in Uganda.

The Oxford research team has been working on the vaccine for some time, including ongoing clinical trials in Oxford and Tanzania.

Teresa Lambe OBE, Professor of Vaccinology and Immunology at the Oxford Vaccine Group, states: "This is a phenomenal feat by all involved, especially our partners Serum Institute. This exceptional partnership has demonstrated yet again the importance of academics working with large scale manufacturers to rapidly pivot and respond to outbreaks, and the importance of working with and having the full support of WHO."

Going forward, and based on the fast deployment of the vaccine, a number of organisations, including government bodies, have embarked upon an ambitious plan to reduce the future risk of pandemics and epidemics.

Part of the strategy is to compress the time taken to develop safe, effective, globally accessible vaccines against new threats to just 100 days.

Achieving this '100 Days Mission' would give a community or country a fighting chance of containing a future outbreak before it spreads to become a global pandemic.
