[It is definitely looking as though transmission is on the road to being interrupted in South Korea as this is the 2nd day in a row when there were no new cases reported. Before one can conclusively state that transmission has been interrupted there must be 2 incubation periods (28 days) with no newly confirmed cases identified.

[With the addition of this newly confirmed case from Riyadh, the total number of cases of MERS-CoV infection reported by Saudi Arabia since June 2012 is 1040, including 470 deaths. This is the 2nd case of MERS-CoV infection reported by Saudi Arabia in the past 8 days.
