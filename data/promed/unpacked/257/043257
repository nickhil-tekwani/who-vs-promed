A 2 year old boy died after being attacked by a fox and contracting human rabies. He lived in the village of Santa Rita, municipality of Chapadinha, in Maranhão. He was hospitalized at the University Hospital of the Federal University of Maranhão (UFMA), in São Luís, for about a month.

[On admission] into the public health unit on [23 Sep 2021], the boy already showed signs of the disease. He had irritation, a high degree of aggression and reactions as if he was going to bite. He struggled with the disease but didn't resist.

This case is the first confirmed occurrence of rabies in Maranhão in the last 8 years. The last 2 cases were registered in 2013, in the municipalities of Humberto de Campos and São José de Ribamar.

In October [2021], the health secretary of Chapadinha, Richard Wilker, commented on the official Instagram of the Municipality of Chapadinha about the boy's situation. He explained that at first, it was suspected that the child had been scratched by a cat and contracted rabies. After extensive investigation, it was concluded that he had been attacked by a fox.

[We extend our sympathy to the child's family.

There is no indication in this article regarding the expanse of time between the fox attack and the time the child was admitted to the hospital. If the child were showing the signs described above, then likely his admission was not immediately following the alleged bite. This article does not describe any bite marks, only scratches. While rabies virus can be transmitted via scratches, it is usually by a cat, because of the way cats groom compared with the grooming habits of a dog, in this case, a possible fox. I would wonder if perhaps a bat were involved and the bite went unnoticed, but the scratch of a nearby cat or dog was noticed. - Mod.TG]

[2] USA (Randolph County, Alabama): dog, human exposure
Date: Wed 10 Nov 2021

The Alabama Department of Public Health (ADPH) is urging everyone to have their pets vaccinated against rabies after an east Alabama family was exposed to a rabid dog last week. According to ADPH officials, the exposure happened in the town of Wadley [Randolf county], after the family took in a stray dog. Officials said the dog had no history of rabies vaccinations.

According to officials, not only is vaccination for rabies required for cats and dogs in the state of Alabama, it is also considered to be the best protection against the virus for both pets and their owners. Currently, ADPH is investigating other potential exposures of people to the animal, so those exposed can seek proper treatment.

Dr Dee W Jones, state public health veterinarian, said rabies is still a concern in Alabama. He wants to warn the public about the dangers of virus. "The nature of the risks of human exposure to rabies has dramatically declined over the last 60 years or so, but since the virus is still seen frequently in raccoons, the risk is still relevant." Jones said it is likely the dog was infected with rabies by a raccoon. According to Jones, raccoons are the reservoir for rabies in Alabama. [Raccoon rabies strain is prevalent in this particular area. - Mod.TG] Alabama is 1 of 17 states in the southeast that uses an oral rabies vaccine to reduce rabies in the raccoon population.

Pet owners are advised to take the following precautions to avoid possible exposure to rabies:
· Do not allow pets to run loose; confine them within a fenced-in area or with a leash.
· Do not leave uneaten pet food or scraps near your residence.
· Do not illegally feed or keep wildlife as pets.
· Do not go near wildlife or domestic animals that are acting in a strange or unusual manner.
· Caution children not to go near any stray or wild animal, regardless of its behavior.
· Advise children to tell an adult if they are bitten or scratched by any animal.

A person who is bitten or scratched by an animal should wash wounds immediately with mild soap and water, apply first aid, and seek medical attention or contact the county health department immediately.

For more information about rabies and prevention, please contact ADPH or visit https://www.alabamapublichealth.gov/infectiousdiseases/rabies.html.

[3] USA (New Castle County, Delaware): raccoon, human exposure
Date: Fri 12 Nov 2021

https://news.delaware.gov/2021/11/12/raccoon-in-bear-tests-positive-for-rabies-after-biting-and-scratching-individual-in-new-castle-county/


The Delaware Division of Public Health (DPH) is advising residents who live or frequent the vicinity of Frazer and Denny Roads in Bear [a town in Delaware] of a positive case of rabies in a raccoon having bitten and scratched a human on [7 Nov 2021]. The raccoon was tested for rabies and the results were positive. The victim who was bitten and scratched has begun exposure prophylaxis.

Anyone who thinks they may have been bitten, scratched, or come in contact with a raccoon in this area should immediately contact their health care provider or call the DPH Rabies Program. An epidemiologist is available 24/7. Anyone in the area who thinks a raccoon might have bitten their pet should call their private veterinarian for examination, treatment, and to report the exposure to Delaware Department of Agriculture.

Since [1 Jan 2021], DPH has performed rabies tests on 176 animals, 18 of which were confirmed to be rabid, including 1 dog, 1 deer, 1 fox, 1 cow, 2 skunks, 3 cats, 6 bats and 3 raccoons, including this most recent positive case. DPH only announces those rabies cases for which it is possible the animal had unknown contacts with additional humans or pets.

In 2020, DPH performed rabies tests on 121 animals, 4 of which were confirmed to be rabid along with 2 positive specimens tested out of state, including 1 raccoon, 1 bat and 4 cats.

Rabies is an infectious disease affecting the nervous system of humans and other mammals. Infection can occur through the bite or scratch of an infected animal or if saliva from such an animal getting into the eyes, nose, mouth, or an opening in the skin. Rabies in humans and animals cannot be cured once signs or symptoms appear. Therefore, if a human has been exposed, and the animal is unavailable to be quarantined or tested, DPH recommends people receive post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) treatment, a series of 4 vaccinations, as a precautionary measure.

If you encounter a wild animal (other than a feral cat or dog) behaving aggressively, it is recommended you contact the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control's (DNREC) Wildlife Section. Staff will determine whether it is more appropriate to refer callers to a private nuisance wildlife control operator. A listing of nuisance wildlife control operators can be found at https://wildlifehelp.org/. Calls after hours and on weekends can be made to the 24-hour dispatch number.

Do not throw items at the animal or make loud banging noises, which may startle the animal and cause it to attack. Instead, your initial response -- if the animal is behaving in an aggressive manner or appears to be foaming at the mouth -- should be to raise your hands above your head to make yourself appear larger to the animal while slowly backing away from it. If the animal starts coming toward you, raise your voice and yell sternly at it, "Get away!" If all of this fails, use any means to protect yourself including throwing an object at the animal or trying to keep it away by using a long stick, shovel, or fishing pole.

If you encounter a stray or feral domestic animal, such as a cat or dog, behaving aggressively, contact the Office of Animal Welfare.

To report a sick or hurt wild animal, Delaware residents are asked to contact the DNREC's Wildlife Section. Staff will determine whether it is more appropriate to refer callers to a permitted volunteer wildlife rehabilitator.

If you encounter a sick stray domestic animal, such as a cat or dog, contact the Office of Animal Welfare.

[4] USA (Dorchester County, South Carolina): kitten, human exposure
Date: Tue 23 Nov 2021
Source: WACH.com [edited]
https://wach.com/news/local/4-people-possibly-exposed-to-rabid-kitten-in-summerville


Four people were potentially exposed to a rabid kitten in Summerville. The stray animal was found near West 6th North Street and North Cedar Street. A colony of feral cats was seen in the area and may have also been exposed. All those potentially exposed were referred to healthcare providers.

The kitten was confirmed on [22 Nov 2021] to have rabies, the Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC) said on Tuesday [23 Nov 2021]. This is the first animal in Dorchester County to test positive for the disease this year [2021].

"To reduce the risk of getting rabies, always give wild and stray animals their space. Stray and feral cats serve as a significant source for rabies exposure," said Terri McCollister, Rabies Program Team Leader. "If you see an animal in need, avoid touching it and contact someone trained in handling animals."

South Carolina sees an average of 148 rabies cases a year. So far, 90 animals have tested positive for rabies in 2021. DHEC is reminding all pet owners to keep their animals up-to-date on vaccinations. "This is one of the easiest and most effective ways to protect against the disease," a press release said. The public should report any animal bites, scratches or potential rabies exposures to DHEC.

[5] Canada (Ontario) - horse, human exposure, not rabies

[This case was originally posted in: ProMED. Rabies (39): Americas (USA, Canada) animal, human 20211106.8699482, and this piece is an interesting follow up. - Mod.TG]

A horse in Perth South, Ontario, Canada, has been reclassified as being negative for rabies. After further testing on a sample from the animal in Blanshard Ward that tested positive for the disease earlier this month [November 2021], Canadian Food Inspection Agency officials say the positive result has been reclassified as negative.

CFIA and Ministry of Health officials say the initial test strongly suggested a low-level positive result and because rabies is fatal and people were exposed to the animal, the positive result was issued. Further testing to determine the type of rabies in a sample found the virus wasn't detected and the first result has now been ruled a false positive.

Officials say the test used has been in place for over 40 years and this is only the second sample out of about 32 000 in the past 10 years to be reported as a false positive.

[Please vaccinate your pets: cats, dogs, horses, cattle, goats, sheep. Vaccination helps to build a barrier between you and the virus. Vaccination of animals you are in contact with is one of those building blocks of the protective fence. Be careful of stray animals. While they may need a home, please get them health checked by your veterinarian and vaccinated.

Check with your county regarding rabies requirements. Some counties with high rabies burdens require an annual vaccination in cats and dogs. Some counties recognize the 3-year vaccine.

Remember bats can bite, transfer the virus, and you may not know you have been bitten, especially if you are bitten when you are sleeping. Make sure attic vents and screens are intact as are window screens to prevent bats from entering the sleeping quarters. Bats can get through tiny holes in screens, so please check the integrity of the window/door screens. - Mod.TG
