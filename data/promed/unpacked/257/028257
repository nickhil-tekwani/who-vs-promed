INFECTION CONTROL - MISSOURI, USA
=================================
Date: Wed, 05 Jun 1996 09:04:57 -0500
From: Marge Borst <BorstM@Mail.Health.State.MO.US>
I am the Nurse Epidemiologist for the Bureau of Communicable Disease
Control, Missouri Dept. of Health, Jefferson City, MO.
Current drug-resistent organisms of concern are: MRSA and VRE.
We recently agreed to participate in CDC's study on drug resistance
among _Salmonella typhi_ isolates.
Infection control professionals have also been alerted to watch for VRSA
[vancomycin resistant _Staph. aureus_]
sending any suspect isolates to our State Lab.
