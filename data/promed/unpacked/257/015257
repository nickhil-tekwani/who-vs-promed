EBLV-2 Seroprevalence Study in Bats in the United Kingdom
---------------------------------------------------------
Preliminary results of a study to assess the presence of European Bat
Lyssavirus type 2 (EBLV-2) in populations of Daubenton's bats (_Myotis
daubentonii_) in the United Kingdom have been published (1). The prevalence
of EBLV-2 antibodies in the sampled bats was approximately 2 percent.
Bats were trapped at several discrete sites in Scotland and northern and
southern England. Blood and saliva samples were taken from these bats,
before they were tagged and released. Bat blood serum was tested for EBLV-2
antibodies using modified fluorescent antibody virus neutralisation. At 2
sites, there was an a priori reason to believe that positive bats would be
found. Data from the bats from these sites produced a prevalence estimate
of 8 percent (95 percent CI: 3-16).
Data from the other sites produced an estimate of approximately 2 percent
(95 percent CI: 1-5). Small numbers of 4 other species of bats were
sampled, including the serotine bat. None of these were seropositive for
EBLV-2, although numbers were too small to estimate prevalence.
Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was done on 58
oral saliva swabs, with results from a further 183 currently expected. All
58 tested so far have been negative, giving rise to the possibility that
bats could be seropositive without excreting virus in saliva. Improved
sampling methods will be employed in future to determine whether bats are
clinically silent carriers of virus with only intermittent secretion of
virus in saliva or whether they recover completely from a self-limiting
infection.
In Europe, more than 700 cases of EBLV have been reported in bats between
1977-2003, mainly in Denmark, Germany, Poland, France and Spain (2, 3, 4).
The majority (>95 percent) of viral isolates diagnosed have been confirmed
as EBLV type 1, and have occurred mostly in the serotine bats, whereas
EBLV-2 has been associated with the _Myotis_ species, and Daubenton's bat.
Since 1977, only 4 confirmed human deaths from EBLV (2 from EBLV-1, and 2
from EBLV-2) have been reported in Europe (4), and therefore the risk to
public health remains low.

[The relatively high incidence of EBLV-2 seropositive bats in some regions
of the UK revealed by this survey contrasts with the failure to detect
infectious virus in blood and saliva samples from bats. The death of the
bat handler in Scotland in 2003 confirmed unequivocally the presence of the
virus in UK bats. This circumstance -- together with the occurrence of
apparently virus-free (seropositive) bats -- has led the authors to suggest
that some bats may survive infection and excrete virus intermittently, an
interesting proposition in relation to the supposed rabies-free status of
the UK. (It is not clear from this report, however, whether all or any of
the bats from which saliva samples were taken were found to be
seropositive). - Mod.CP]
