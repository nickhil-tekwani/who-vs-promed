African swine fever outbreak in Torzhok
---------------------------------------
Pigs were found dead in a pig farm situated in the territory of one
of the penal colonies in Torzhok, the Tver Oblast. In the course of
testing of pathological material taken from dead or emergency
slaughtered pigs the specialists of the All-Russia Research Institute
of Veterinary Virology and Microbiology (VNIIVViM) of the
Rosselkhozacademy detected genetic material of African swine fever
[ASF] virus.

[The current] swine population of the farm is 80 pigs; 53 pigs were
dead and destroyed, and 120 pigs were emergency slaughtered. At the
moment, all the necessary measures are taken in full at the site of
the outbreak; the official investigation aimed at detection of
infection routes is being carried out.
