Virus closes animal exhibit
---------------------------
The Minnesota Zoo's popular goat and sheep barn could be closed for 2
months as the animals recover from a contagious virus infection -- known by
several names, including orf, sore mouth and contagious pustular
dermatitis. The virus causes pimples, blisters and scabs around an animal's
orifices and hooves, but infection is usually not fatal unless the
illness prevents the animal from eating. The zoo's musk oxen developed
symptoms last month and the sheep last week, but goats have not been affected.
Humans can develop lesions on their hands after direct contact with
infected animals, but zoo veterinarian Jim Rasmussen doesn't think the
public was exposed. No zookeepers have had symptoms. Unlike other zoo
exhibits, children are allowed to climb in the goat pens and play, pet and
feed the docile animals. None of those goats have exhibited symptoms of
infection, but they will be quarantined until their barn mates recover,
because the virus is contagious.
Most of the animals have already returned from quarantine because they have
little contact with visitors. Although the animals are housed several
hundred yards apart, the virus may have spread between the animals -- which
are related -- via insects or birds.
The oxen suffered a similar virus about 18 years ago. Some of the virus
could have survived from that infection and, complicated by the wet spring
and hot summer, may have triggered a new one, Rasmussen said. Since [no
specific treatment is available the zoo will let the virus run its course,
which is usually about 3 weeks. The sheep and goat barn will remain closed
longer to make sure the exhibit is safe for visitors, said Jim Streater,
vice president of the zoo's biological programs. The rest of the zoo
remains open to the public.

[Contagious ecthyma (orf) is an infectious dermatitis of sheep and goats,
affecting primarily the lips of young animals. It is more severe in goats
than sheep. Humans can be affected and the disease has been reported in
dogs that have eaten infected carcasses. The causal poxvirus is related to
those of pseudocowpox and bovine papular stomatitis. Infection occurs by
contact. The lesions, although characteristic, must be differentiated from
ulcerative dermatosis, which produces tissue destruction and crateriform
ulcers. Ecthyma usually affects younger animals than does ulcerative
dermatosis, although this is not always the case. The virus is highly
resistant to desiccation, having been recovered from dried crusts after 12
years. - Mod.TG
