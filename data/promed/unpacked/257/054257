The State Health Department has identified 4 areas in Penang as hotspots
for _Aedes_ mosquito breeding. State deputy director of health Dr Yasmin
Sulaiman said the Kampung Melayu flats in Air Itam, Taman Seri Sari in
Relau, and Villa Sri Kenanga as well as the Desa Riang flats in Batu Uban
were hotspots which had recorded at least 2 cases of dengue fever.

"The purpose of disclosing this information is to alert the public,
especially residents in the affected areas to be more sensitive to the
current situation as well as the role that the local residents could play,"
she said in a statement, [in Penang] Wednesday [17 Feb 2010]. She said
members of the public needed only to spend 10 minutes each week to ensure
that there were no _Aedes_ mosquito breeding grounds at home.

"If there are family members who have fever, get immediate treatment at the
nearest clinics or hospitals as it is feared that they may have contacted
dengue fever," she said.

Dengue fever has killed 2 residents of the East Java town of Kediri.
Director of Gambiran Public Hospital, Sentot Imam Suprapto, said here on
Thursday [18 Feb 2010] that the 4 year old had been in a bad condition when
he was admitted to the hospital. "We have done our best to save him," he
said. The other, a university student, was admitted to Dr Soetomo public
hospital in East Java capital of Surabaya but the doctors failed to save
him. He died on Thursday morning [18 Feb 2010].

Over the past 2 months, 103 Kediri residents had suffered from the fever,
usually transmitted by the _Aedes aegypti_ and _Aedes albopictus_
mosquitoes. The number of dengue fever patients being treated at Gambiran
public hospital tended to increase. "If in January, there are 39 patients,
the number increases to 59 in mid February [2010]," Suprapto said. The
hospital on average received 10 patients every day. Due to over capacity,
some patients were cared [for] at the hospital's corridors. "We have so far
cared [for] 25 patients in the children rooms while the rooms are ideally
just for 19 children," he said.

In halting the spread of dengue fever during the rainy season, the Kediri
government spokesman, Nur Mukhyar, called on his people to keep their
neighborhoods clean. He said the people need to get rid of stagnant water
within their houses because it could be used as the _Aedes_ mosquitoes'
breeding site.

Heavy rains and floods have caused a spike of dengue fever cases in Bekasi,
West Java, with around 90 patients admitted with the virus [infection]
during the first 2 weeks this month [Feb 2010].

Bekasi health agency head Retni Yonti said that a patient had died after
suffering a combination of dengue fever and another unidentified illness.
Some 170 dengue fever cases were reported in January [2010], a significant
increase compared to the 30-cases-per-month through the Jun-Dec period at
the end of last year [2009], she added.

All community health centers in Bekasi have been supplied with medicine to
counter the mosquito-transmitted illness [virus], said Retni as quoted by
Antara news agency. "Each health center has a laboratory facility to help
the medical officers identify the fever and determine suitable treatment,"
she added.

[The] dengue fever outbreak is expected to reach its peak this month
[February 2010] as the number of patients soars. Data at the Sanglah
Central Hospital, the island's largest medical facility, show that the
daily average number of dengue fever patients has reached 60 per cent [I
think this may mean that dengue cases account for 60 per cent of new
admissions. - Mod.SH], a 50 per cent increase from January [2010].

Nowadays, dengue fever patients occupy 15 per cent of the hospital's beds
total of 750. "We have to install 24 additional beds to cope with this
situation," said the hospital's director of medical service, I Gusti Lanang
Suartana.

have been detected in Jaffna district while 814 cases had been reported in
the month of January [2010]. This shows an increase by about 50 per cent,
according to Health Ministry official in Colombo, [where] 733 dengue cases
have been reported and 833 from Gampaha from 1 Jan-17 Feb [2010]. Health
authorities said the 2 districts had had high number of cases last year
[2009] as well.

The total number of dengue cases reported [nationally] was 6638 while the
number of dengue deaths was 42 since January [2010], ministry official said

A case of dengue type 3 virus infection imported from Africa to Italy,
October 2009
----------------------------------------------------------------------
[authors: Nisii C, Carletti F, Castilletti C, Bordi L, et al]

In October 2009, a traveller returning from Africa to Italy was
hospitalised with symptoms suggestive of a haemorrhagic fever of unknown
origin. The patient was immediately placed in a special biocontainment unit
until laboratory investigations confirmed the infection to be caused by a
dengue serotype 3 virus. This case reasserts the importance of returning
travellers as sentinels of unknown outbreaks occurring in other countries,
and highlights how the initial symptoms of dengue fever resemble those of
other haemorrhagic fevers, hence the importance of prompt isolation of
patients until a final diagnosis is reached.

We have described a case of dengue virus infection imported into Italy from
Africa, which to date has been a rare occurrence as most cases seen in
European travel clinics have been imported either from Asia or the
Americas. Dengue virus has been known to circulate in parts of Africa for
decades, and Senegal in particular has experienced several outbreaks,
mainly of dengue serotype 2 virus. Following our report, which was the
first for a dengue serotype 3 virus in Senegal, the country's health
authorities were alerted to a possible epidemic and since then, over 50
cases have been registered in the country, confirming the importance of
returning travellers as sentinels of as yet unreported outbreaks occurring
abroad.

[An interesting additional retrospective report of dengue in West Africa by
L Franco and colleagues in this same issue of Eurosurveillance
(<http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=19490>; summ.,
edited) stated that, "The burden of dengue virus infection in Africa has
not been estimated yet. Outbreaks of dengue fever and dengue haemorrhagic
fever are poorly documented, however, we cannot conclude that mild and
severe dengue infection is infrequent in African countries. The circulation
of different dengue virus serotypes is also poorly documented. Nevertheless
some information is provided in publications on outbreaks and serosurvey
studies in Africa and reports involving dengue virus infection in travelers.

"The 1st dengue virus (DENV) isolate was DENV-1, detected in Nigeria in
1964. Since then DENV-1, 2 and 4 have been circulating in West Africa
although the main serotype reported has been DENV-2. Viral isolates have
been predominantly detected in wild-caught mosquitoes (_Aedes
luteocephalus_, _Ae. taylori_ and/or _Ae. furcifer_) involved in sylvatic
transmission cycles in Senegal and Nigeria, and from a few cases in humans
who were in contact with forest cycles. DENV-2 from sylvatic cycles has
also been isolated in Cote d'Ivoire, Burkina Faso, and Guinea. More
recently in 2005, DENV-2 was identified in a traveller returning from
Ghana. The last detection of DENV-4 in West Africa was in the 1980s in 2
inhabitants of Dakar, Senegal.

"The 1st description of DENV-3 activity in Africa was related to outbreaks
detected during 1984 and 1985 in Pemba, Mozambique, with 2 deaths due to
dengue haemorrhagic fever. DENV-3 was then detected in 1993 in Somalia and
areas around the Persian Gulf. Phylogenetic studies suggested that these
outbreaks were caused by a virus imported from the Indian subcontinent.
DENV-3 circulation in West Africa was first identified in a traveller
returning to Spain from Cameroon in 2006 and subsequently in a traveller
returning to Spain from Senegal in 2007 (C Domingo et al, unpublished
results). However the 1st article on DENV-3 in West Africa was published in
2008, when DENV-3 was detected co-circulating with yellow fever in Cote
d'Ivoire."

Both Eurosurveillance reports are fully documented.

These reports make one question the contention that dengue and DHF are not
serious problems in Africa, leading to speculation that genetic differences
in the African population are sparing of serious disease. It would appear
that difference in incidence may be an artifact of inadequate surveillance
and reporting.

There has been a resurgence of dengue fever in American Samoa with 42
positive cases last month [January 2010]. This is up on December [2009]
when just 17 of those tested had the mosquitoborne disease [virus].

The LBJ hospital's chief medical officer, Taulapapa Dr Aloiamoa Anesi, says
the territory is still having a lot of rain and the risk of infection
remains. He says mosquito eradication through clearing potential breeding
grounds is still very important, along with wearing proper clothing and
using DEET-containing mosquito repellents.

The Ministry of Health confirmed that there is a dengue epidemic in the
municipalities of 5 states in the country -- Mato Grosso, Mato Grosso do
Sul, Acre, Roraima, and Goias. Also, according to the agency, with the
largest movement of people in the Carnival [season, 6-15 Feb 2010], there
is greater risk of the disease -- until now concentrated in areas of lowest
population density -- from spreading. "There is always the risk of the
carnival changing the behavior of the epidemic," said the coordinator of
the National Dengue Control of the Ministry of Health, Giovanini Evelim
Coelho. Health authorities consider that there is epidemic when the disease
incidence reaches 300 cases per 100 000 inhabitants.

At the beginning of this month [February 2010], the federal government had
already warned about the risk of epidemic because of the return of dengue
virus type 1, which had not been circulating for 10 years. The absence of
infections by [that] serotype causes many people, especially children, to
not be immune against it yet, which facilitates the increase of cases.
According to the agency, Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Espirito Santo, Goias,
Mato Grosso do Sul, Roraima, Tocantins and Piaui are the places most at
risk because they have a predominance of the "new" virus [serotype].
According to Coelho, a reassuring fact is that there have been no recorded
significant increases in disease in Sao Paulo, Rio, Salvador, Fortaleza,
and Belo Horizonte.

Last month [January 2010] Campo Grande registered 7229 suspected dengue
cases, or which 826 were confirmed. In Mato Grosso the recorded [dengue]
cases had a increase of 804 percent compared to 2009. Since January [2010]
there were 12 666 cases and 5 deaths confirmed for the disease. The
information is from the Journal of the State of Sao Paulo [Jornal O Estado
de S Paulo].

suggested that the dengue situation in Brazil could become worse in 2010
because of the prevalence of dengue virus-1, which, after being the least
frequent serotype, is capable of causing epidemics in cities where the
population was practically immune from previous exposure to other dengue
virus serotypes. In Sao Paulo state, the number of suspected dengue cases
increased by 89 percent compared to the 1st 3 weeks of 2009, when dengue
virus-2 was the predominant serotype. In Minas Gerais in 2009, of the 233

type 2 and 114 type 3.

Since the beginning of the year [2010] up to now, 2787 people have been
infected [with dengue]. In just one day, Rio Preto confirmed another 441
dengue cases. Now, there are 2787 people who are infected in the 1st 44
days of the year. From January [2010] up to now, 2 people have died from
the disease.

The [Rio Preto] municipality leads in the ranking of cities with the
greatest number of dengue cases in the state of Sao Paulo. The city has a
daily average of 66 dengue cases. Up to Friday [19 Feb 2010], 36 people
with dengue had been admitted to hospitals. According to Luciano Garcia
Lourencao, coordinator of epidemiological surveillance, the numbers
announced this Friday [19 Feb 2010] are the result of tests done during the
week. He said the situation must become even worse after Carnival. "The
UBSs (Basic Health Units) are full. The flow of suspected cases should

In Misiones province, in one week the number of ill people [from dengue]
doubled and now total 424 positive cases detected so far this summer
[2009-10]. Chaco, the most affected province during the [dengue] epidemic
last year [2009] recently registered 23 confirmed [dengue] cases and virus
circulation is going on. Also, there are confirmed cases in Corrientes,
Santa Fe, and Buenos Aires provinces.

In just one week, dengue illnesses in the northern part of Misiones
province increased from 247 to 424, of which 70 are going through the
illness [currently], while the rest were discharged, announced the Ministry
of Public Health of the province. According to the provincial subsecretary
of public health, Oscar Herreran Ahuad, cases began to be registered on 14
Dec 2009, and to date, most have been detected in the northern zone of
Misiones, especially in Puerto Iguazu, on the border with Paraguay and Brazil.

Meanwhile, in Chaco, the province most affected by the invasion of the
mosquito _Aedes aegypti_ during last summer [2008-09], the minister of
public health, Francisco Bloquero, yesterday [18 Feb 2010] confirmed that
there already are 23 positive dengue cases in the province, a situation
which obligated the intensification of the tasks of fumigation in
localities of risk where, he warned, there is now [dengue] virus
circulation. According to the newspaper La Nacion, health authorities
stated that [dengue] cases are being registered in Corzuela, a locale very
close to Charata, the city most affected by the disease in 2009.

Corrientes also suffers the arrival of the dengue mosquito vector. The
Ministry of Public Health confirmed yesterday [18 Feb 2010] the 1st locally
acquired case in the province, while 4 other patients were infected outside
the [provincial] territory. With the emergence of this case, health
authorities arranged vector blocking tasks in the area of San Martin in the
capital of Corrientes, where the 1st 3 infected individuals were
registered, all members of a family that had travelled to Misiones during
the 1st week of January [2010].

Also, 4 [dengue] cases were registered in Santa Fe [province], one of which
was locally acquired, another which is under investigation in the Maiztegui
Institute, and the rest were imported from Colombia and Brazil. The areas
where the infected individuals reside are Santo Tome, Rosario, the Perez
neighborhood adjoining that city, and in Bombal, 100 km [62 mi] to the south.

In the city of Buenos Aires, according to the explanation of the Minister
of Health of the city, Jorge Lemus, this summer [2009-10] "there have been
5 imported dengue cases and 3 locally acquired, less than half of those of
last year [2008-09]." The 1st case of dengue "imported" into Buenos Aires
province was announced after a 47 year old woman contracted the disease in
Puerto Iguazu. Health authorities clarified that this is the 1st case
detected in the province so far this year [2010] and that it came a month
later than the 1st, which occurred in that territory in 2009. Also under
study are 23 febrile cases that could be infected with this disease [virus].

On Wednesday [17 Feb 2010] the 1st case of imported dengue was reported in
La Plata; in addition, 23 febrile cases are under study that could be new
dengue virus infections.

Dengue in Latin America leaves 37 dead and almost 2 million affected
individuals
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Latin American governments prepare to face the advance of dengue in the
region, which according to the latest official reports leaves almost 2
million confirmed cases and 37 fatal victims so far this year [2010].

Colombia heads the list of deaths with 18 fatalities, according to the
Ministry of Social Protection [which includes health. - Mod.TY], which
reported 14 801 illnesses, the motive for the "green hospital alert" decree
that guarantees timely provision of health services in private and public
hospitals of the country.

Despite the fact that for the Brazilian Ministry of Health, [dengue] still
does not warrant epidemic consideration, an alert was issued for the
presence of [dengue virus] serotype 1, which has not been the predominant
[dengue virus serotype] over the past 10 years. There [in Brazil] the worst
total is for Goiania, with more than 25 000 individuals infected and 5
deaths, followed by Mato Grosso (15 300 ill people and a presumed 8 fatal
victims), Mato Grosso do Sul (15 000 patients and 2 deaths under
investigation), and the Federal District [Brasilia] (more than 1400 ill
individuals and 2 deaths).

Alarms have been sounded as well in Paraguay with 477 infected individuals,
1653 symptomatic patients, and a possible presence of serotypes DEN-1,
DEN-2, and DEN-3.

In Argentina, the 465 confirmed (serotype not specified) cases indicate
that the epidemic is strengthening is the south of the continent, with
Misiones province on the border with Brazil and Paraguay being the most
affected province with 428 cases since mid December [2009] when a "yellow
alert" was decreed. Prevention measures are being implemented to avoid last
year's [2009] tragedy when 50 000 people were affected and an additional 10
died.

The same situation occurs in Bolivia where 2 weeks ago the death of a 2
year old girl was confirmed in San Matias (border with Brazil). Health
authorities have reported 57 cases of classical dengue fever and are
awaiting results of 800 suspected cases in 6 of the 9 departments.

In Ecuador subsecretary for health, Marcelo Aguilar, reported 1800 cases of
people who were bitten by the _Ae. aegypti_ mosquito that transmits dengue,
of which some 45 have the hemorrhagic variant of the disease.

Although no official data are available, new cases are being reported in
the north of Peru, in particular the regions of Piura and La Libertad.
Pedro Dias, head of epidemiology of the Belen hospital in Trujillo,
reported 19 confirmed cases of classical dengue fever and 32 probable cases.

In Central America, according to a spokesperson from the Health
Secretariat, a 26 year old man is the 1st fatal case of dengue in 2010 in
Honduras, where 87 cases have been confirmed.

Costa Rica with 426 patients and Nicaragua with 180 confirmed cases of
classical dengue fever are conducting frequent fumigation, clean up of
breeding sites and educational campaigns.

In Salvador there are 1294 cases of classical dengue fever and 28 of DHF,
and increase of 918 per cent compared with the same period last year
[2009], when there were 126 cases of dengue and 4 of DHF.

Mexico reports a decrease of 26 per cent in the number of patients (691)
during the 1st 3 weeks of 2010 as compared to the same period in 2009. The
government, which carried out fumigation campaigns during the rainy season
is now conducting them throughout the year, resulting in a 20-30 per cent
increase in public spending for fighting the disease.

Despite the situation in neighboring countries, Paraguay has reported no
cases and in Chile --declared free of the vector since 1961 by PAHO--
isolated cases have been detected, which authorities have designated as
"imported."

In Cuba, according to president Raul Castro, last year [2009] the
government reported 53 outbreaks of classical dengue -- of which 43 were
imported -- which were eradicated.

According to PAHO, until epidemiological week 45 of 2009 [8-14 Nov 2009]
853 468 cases of dengue were reported from America, including 20 832 cases
of DHF and complicated variants of the disease and 326 deaths with a
regional case fatality rate of 1.56 per cent.
