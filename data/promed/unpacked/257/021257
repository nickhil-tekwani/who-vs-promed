An alarming number of new leprosy cases has become a cause of concern to officials.

The centre had set a target for eradication by 2018. A total of 719 cases were detected in 5 districts across the state [Andhra Pradesh], where they conducted a Leprosy Case Detection Campaign (LCDC) in November [2017].

In fact, the state had earlier ended the leprosy campaign by 2005 as cases had reached a nominal of one per 10 000 cases. [WHO has defined the elimination of leprosy as a public health problem as a prevalence rate of less than one case per 10 000 inhabitants.]

But, state officials conducted a survey in Vizianagaram last year [2016] on a pilot basis in which 163 cases were detected, which made the Medical and Health department continue the survey. As part of the exercise, officials released Rs. 3.37 crore [1 crore Rupees equals 10 million Rupees, and at an exchange rate of 60 Rupees to 1 USD, 160 000 USD] to Nellore, Anantapur, Kurnool, Srikakulam and Vizianagaram districts for conducting the survey by ASHA volunteers and others engaged on a temporary basis for the work [ASHA, or Accredited Social Health Activists, are literate women between 25 and 45 years of age selected from the village itself and accountable to it, who are trained to work as an interface between the community and the public health system (http://nhm.gov.in/communitisation/asha/about-asha.html)]. In Nellore, the survey was taken up from 13-26 Nov [2017].

The survey was conducted in 5 districts and confirmed leprosy cases were detected by the officials. In Nellore, consultant from NLEP [India's National Leprosy Elimination Programme] Dr A Paramananda Prasad Babu had started the process of checking on how the ASHA and other volunteers collected data and followed the survey guidelines, keeping in view possible errors.

As per the survey findings, 80 cases in Anantapur, 124 cases in Srikakulam, 118 in Nellore and Vizianagaram, and the highest 208 in Kurnool district were found. With this, the government of India started a campaign to make the state leprosy free, and consequent efforts continue with further phases conducting the survey in other 8 districts in the state.

It was also decided to take up survey even for 6 months if necessary for identifying fresh cases and for taking up follow up action. In fact, experts in the field say there will be more hidden cases as the survey was taken up by only ASHA volunteers and the medical officers of the concerned areas supervised it.

Additional DM&HO [District Medical and Health Officer?] Dr CV Ramadevi said that they had conducted a survey in the district from 13 to 26 Nov [2017], and now the consultant is verifying the process on the special survey that was conducted for 14 days.

[The above news report confirms the old adage "seek and you shall find."

Although India achieved nationally what WHO refers to as "the elimination of leprosy as a public health problem" (that is, a prevalence of less than one case per 10 000 population) in December 2005, leprosy has not been eradicated in India. In fact, in 2016, India contributed 63% of new cases of leprosy reported worldwide (http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/249601/1/WER9135.pdf).

In 2016, 49.6 per cent of new cases in India had multibacillary [infectious] leprosy, which is an indication of the proportion of new cases with contagious disease in the community; 8.7 per cent of new cases occurred in children, which is an indication of ongoing disease transmission; and 3.9% of new cases of leprosy had chronic deformities and disability, which reflects problems in case finding (http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/258842/1/WER9235-501-519.pdf).

The prevalence rate of leprosy is calculated as the number of patients receiving multidrug therapy per 10 000 population at a particular point in time. The prevalence rate of leprosy for India as a whole, with a total of 88 166 cases on record as of the end of 2016 or end of the 1st quarter of 2017, is 0.66 per 10 000 population, which is less than the WHO benchmark of one case per 10 000 population for the elimination of leprosy as a public health problem; but how many cases are still being missed? - Mod.ML
