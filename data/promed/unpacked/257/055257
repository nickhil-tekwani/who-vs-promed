["Infection with Brucella in sheep and goats (excluding _B. ovis_ infection) is primarily caused by one of the 3 biovars of _B. melitensis_. Sporadic infections caused by _B. abortus_ or _B. suis_ have been observed in sheep and goats, but such cases are extremely rare. Infection with Brucella in sheep and goats is endemic in the Mediterranean region, but infection is widespread worldwide. North America (except Mexico) is believed to be free from the agent, as are northern and central Europe, southeast Asia, Australia and New Zealand.

Pathologically and epidemiologically, _B. melitensis_ infection in sheep and goats is very similar to _B. abortus_ infection in cattle. In most circumstances, the primary routes of transmission of Brucella are the placenta, fetal fluids and vaginal discharges expelled by infected ewes and goats when they abort or have full-term parturition. Shedding of Brucella is also common in udder secretions and semen, and Brucella may be isolated from various tissues, such as lymph nodes from the head, spleen and organs associated with reproduction (uterus, epididymides and testes), and from arthritic lesions" http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.01.04_BRUCELLOSIS.pdf.

"_B. melitensis_ is highly pathogenic for humans; this organism is considered to be the most severe human pathogen in the genus. Occupational exposure is seen in laboratory workers, farmers, veterinarians and others who contact infected animals or tissues. Brucellosis is one of the most easily acquired laboratory infections. People who do not work with animals or tissues usually become infected by ingesting unpasteurized dairy products. The Rev-1 B. melitensis vaccine is also pathogenic for humans and must be handled with caution to avoid accidental injection or contamination of mucous membranes or abraded skin" http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/brucellosis_melitensis.pdf. - Mod.CRD
