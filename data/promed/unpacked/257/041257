Abstract
--------
_Mycobacterium bovis_ can cause tuberculosis (TB) in social mammals including lions, cattle, and man, but canine infections are considered rare. In 2016/17 we investigated a _M. bovis_ TB outbreak in a pack of approximately 180 Foxhounds within the bovine TB Edge Area of England. We employed a combination of immunological tests including an interferon gamma release assay (IGRA) and a serological assay (DPP VetTB, Chembio). Test‐positive hounds were euthanased and subjected to post-mortem examination (PME). Overall, 164 hounds were tested; 97 (59 percent) responded positively to at least one test. 85 (52 percent) of the dogs responded to _M. bovis_ antigens by IGRA, while only 21 (12.9 percent) had detectable serological responses. At PME, 3 hounds (3.1 percent) had visible lesions (VL) due to _M. bovis_ infection, later confirmed by culture. Samples from 24 non‐VL hounds were cultured, and _M. bovis_ infection was confirmed in a further 3 hounds (11 percent). This study is the 1st investigation and report of an outbreak of _M. bovis_ TB in a canine species. We establish that, in principle, diagnostic tests used for identifying infected individuals of other species can effectively be used in the dog. Further work is urgently needed to establish the sensitivity and specificity of the testing approach used in this study for future clinical application.

[On 28 Feb 2017, MFHA (the "Masters of Foxhounds Association," the governing body of foxhunting, representing 176 packs of foxhounds that hunt in England and Wales and a further 10 in Scotland) informed the public about the exceptional bTB event in the Kimblewick Hunt. It was disclosed that "The Kimblewick and Hunting Office are working closely with officials from DEFRA, Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA), Public Health England, the Royal Dick Veterinary School (Edinburgh), and other vets with specialist expertise in bTB in order to determine the exact position and the best way forward." (See 20170308.4886254 and https://www.horseandhound.co.uk/news/bovine-tb-confirmed-kimblewick-hounds-614291).

The current paper is the outcome of the mentioned collaborative effort by the named parties.

From the discussion chapter, the following is copied for subscribers' convenience:

"Whilst uncertainty exists with regards to the source of infection, it seems likely that contaminated fallen stock carcasses were involved. All cultured positive animals had the same genotype isolated, which has not been frequently detected in the area local to the kennels. This suggests a single introduction with a large dose of infectious material was likely, and that infection then spread between cohabiting hounds. One kennel worker was also diagnosed with latent TB, potentially due to exposure to infected hounds and/or their contaminated feed, though this remains unproven. Though the risk posed by _M. bovis_ infected hounds to other hounds, cattle herds, local wildlife, their environment, and their human keepers is low, this outbreak demonstrates that the risk is plausible and real. Resultantly, to try to prevent such an outbreak from occurring again, the conditions for the collection and use of animal by‐products for feeding to dogs in recognized kennels or packs of hounds have now been amended to ban the feeding of offal from fallen stock. Similarly, health surveillance requirements for hounds have been increased by the MFHA. To be successful, these policy changes will need to be aided, however, by the future evaluation of diagnostic test accuracy and test development for canine TB."
