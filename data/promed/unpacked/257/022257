An unknown disease has killed 4 people in East Pokot-Tiaty sub-county in February [2014], a report has said. A baseline report submitted to the media by Baringo county doctors yesterday [9 Mar 2014] indicates that a pupil at Plesian Primary School died while on a tour to Nakuru on [8 Feb 2014] while 2 women aged 49 and 55 died on [11 and 17 Feb 2014] in Nasur and Todo villages.

The doctors say several other patients still posses the symptoms of the disease. Baringo Chief Officer for Health Gideon Toromo said 31 blood specimens collected from women, men, and children from various villages and dispensaries in the area and taken to Kemri [Kenya Medical Research Institute] laboratory in Kisumu tested negative of malaria. The report says there is no relief food supply to the area to warrant suspicion of food poisoning (aflatoxins), no history of travel amongst the sick and Amaya and Plesian dispensaries have enough drugs.

Dr Toromo said the deceased complained bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and headache. He said the pastoral residents in the area are saying most of their animals are sick.

The water sources have dried up hence most people and animals get drinking water from shallow sand dug wells.

Toromo said the groundwork research was carried out by Micah N Cherop (county disease surveillance coordinator), Haron Bowen (county medical laboratory technologist), Duke Omariba (Kemri water reed project manager), and Winnie Korir (Kemri research nurse).

He said it is still too early to speculate on the cause of the disease. "We suspect it could be one of those zoonotic viral infections such as Q-fever, which is caused by _Coxiella burnetii_," Toromo said.

[The lack of potable water may well be the problem here causing a contaminated waterborne outbreak that affects humans and animals and causes bloody diarrhea and abdominal pain and headache in humans. The symptom complex in the animals is not stated. Bloody diarrhea strongly suggests dysentery such as caused by shigellosis or amoebiasis although other intestinal bacillary illnesses such as salmonellosis and campylobacteriosis can cause bloody diarrhea and enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ (EHEC) classically does. Q fever is not generally waterborne illness and is not caused by a virus as stated but a rickettsial bacterium.

Of this list, there is not a good fit since the zoonotic organisms such as EHEC, salmonellosis, and campylobacteriosis generally do not cause disease in livestock, if indeed the animals mentioned are livestock and _Shigella_ and _Entamoeba_ are not zoonoses.

It is also possible that the illnesses in the people and the animals are of different etiology. - Mod.LL]

[Some of the symptoms mentioned are compatible with Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus infections in the human cases and could account for livestock illnesses, although no symptoms or species involved are mentioned. Other common RFV symptoms such as encephalitis and ocular disease are not mentioned (see the CDC fact sheets at ). However, KEMRI health professionals are very familiar with RVF which has caused major outbreaks in Kenya, yet RVF virus is not mentioned as a possible cause of these cases, casting doubt on RVF virus as the etiological agent involved in these cases. RVF outbreaks have been associated with wet conditions, not drought. Mod. TY]
