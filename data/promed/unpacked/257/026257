By 2016, an episode of anthrax had affected the Moselle during the summer. Up to 8 outbreaks were detected and 32 cattle died of the bacteria .

A vaccination campaign was undertaken during the summer in 15 communes to encourage breeders to protect animals grazing on the area as well as those fed with hay, wrapped silage, or any other type of silage in the area at risk.

Following the refusal of the farmer , the animal which had just been infected had not been vaccinated while it was grazing in an at risk zone .

Animal husbandry was observed while awaiting compulsory vaccination of animals.

This episode recalls the need for pastoralists in areas historically affected by cases of anthrax, to vaccinate animals before putting them out to pasture and for those animals which will eat fodder,[silage, hay] harvested from fields with a history of anthrax.

The vaccine can be obtained from veterinary surgeries for about 80 euros per 25 doses. Breeders can carry out preventive vaccinations themselves, as long as the livestock is not affected by the disease.

[France is in that difficult stage of truly sporadic anthrax and of persuading livestock owners to vaccinate their stock in areas perceived to be at risk. And it is the procrastinators that allow the disease to persist as their stock succumbs to infection. It takes much hard work by the regional veterinary staff to get the active attention and participation by their livestock owners. The spores are not immortal so the trick is to not replace the dying spores with fresh live ones from yet another outbreak. A total of 5 years without outbreaks is a good indicator that eradication is coming. Our thanks to Susan for the translation. - Mod.MHJ]
