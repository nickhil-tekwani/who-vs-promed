The Daily Observer was informed late Sunday [30 Mar 2014] night by Health and Social Welfare Minister Dr. (MD) Walter Traub Gwenigale that of the 5 blood samples sent to Lyons, France for testing, 2 tested positive for an Ebolavirus, which has a "case fatality rate of 90 percent," according to the World Health Organization (WHO) [for the type Zaire strain (EBOV; previously ZEBOV) - Mod.JW].

"Now, of the 2 patients, one has already died in Foya, Lofa County, and the other person was the sister of the dead person. This sister was the one looking after [the deceased] when she fell sick. Blood from her, too, tested positive," Dr. Gwenigale told the Observer.

According to him, his worries are now centered on the surviving sister of the deceased (both of their names remain unknown), as she reportedly travelled [all the way from the extreme north to the south of Liberia] from Lofa to Firestone [near Harbel] in Margibi County [not far from the capital, Monrovia] and likely interacted with several persons along the way. This opens a possibility that some of the people she interacted with on her way and since her arrival in Firestone have also become infected. "We have informed Dr. Mabande, who is the medical director there, and they are trying to quarantine her," Dr. Gwenigale said.

The Health and Social Welfare Minister disclosed that authorities at the US Government's Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in Atlanta, GA had also called him concerning the news from France, and said they (authorities at CDC) had already been briefed.

Even though the GOL [Government of Liberia] had stated categorically that the Ebolavirus was not anywhere in Liberia, the Health Ministry, in its Fri 28 Mar 2014 update, said they and their partners have stepped up efforts and strategies to "prevent the spread of the Ebolavirus from neighboring Guinea into Liberia. The public information campaign has been intensified and hotlines established for the public to call and get basic information about the disease. The hotline numbers are 0770198517, 0777549805, 0886530260, 0886549805."

Other ongoing efforts, according to the MOH, include the coordination of the planning and response efforts at both national and county levels, distribution of personal protective equipment sets to hospitals in Montserrado, deployment of 2 teams to Nimba and Bong counties to support the County Health Teams, training of clinicians to create more awareness, resource mobilization, distribution of supplies to improve hygiene, water and sanitation in counties bordering Guinea, active and passive surveillance and case management in affected areas.

It also stated that its task force has printed awareness messages in various dialects and information fliers on Ebola have been produced and disseminated to the various counties as part of efforts to prevent the spread of the disease to Liberia.

The Health Ministry again reiterated its safety tips to the public: "Do not eat animals that are found dead in the bush, and avoid contacts with fruit bats, monkeys, chimpanzees, antelopes and porcupines. Limit as much as possible direct contact with body fluids of infected persons or dead persons. Wash your hands with soap and water as frequently as possible. Treat your water with chlorine before drinking."

Ebola Outbreak Timeline:
-----------------------------------------------
Mon 24 Mar 2014
The Daily Observer broke the news that Liberia was threatened with a possible outbreak of Ebola within its border after Guinea had lost at least 59 of its citizens to the deadly disease, which has been wreaking havoc since 7 Feb 2014. The GOL [Government of Liberia], including the Ministries of Information, Culture and Tourism and Health and Social Welfare, along with the World Health Organization (WHO) Office in Liberia, had a major press conference in which they told the nation that Ebola has crossed over into Liberia. They further stated that as of 24 Mar 2014, 6 persons had been affected and that it had claimed at least 5 lives: 3 of which died on Liberian soil and 2 which returned to Guinea and expired there. They said that the last of the 6, a female child, was undergoing treatment at a medical facility in Zorzor, Lofa County.

Wed 26 Mar 2014
The Daily Observer Nimba County Correspondent, Ishmael Menkor, was told by Dr. Claude Monga, Acting Chief Medical Officer of Ganta Hospital, that the hospital on Monday [24 Mar 2014] transferred 2 patients suspected of contacting the Ebolavirus to the JFK Medical Hospital in Monrovia. And on the evening of same day, the Daily Observer was reliably hinted to by a credible source at the JFK that one person had been quarantined within its (JFK) facility. That person, according to our source, had shown symptoms of the Ebolavirus. The GOL, having told the nation on Monday, 24 Mar 2014, that Ebola had crossed over into Liberia, sumersaulted on Wed 26 Mar 2014 and said that Ebola was not in Liberia. They dropped the number of fatalities to 4; however, they maintained the 6 cases. Health and Social Welfare Minister Gwenigale also told the Observer that the report of one patient being quarantined at JFK was not true. JFK Hospital also issued a release denying reports that Ganta Hospital had transferred suspected Ebola patients to it.

Fri 28 Mar 2014
The Senate Chairman on Gender, Health, Social Welfare, Women and Children Affairs, Senator, Dr. (MD) Peter S. Coleman, briefed the Senate Plenary. He told his colleagues that a budget to the tune of USD 1.2 million had been drawn up to help contain apparent discovery of Ebolavirus within the MRU [Mano River Union] sub-region. The ECOWAS [Economic Community of West African States] also described the news of the Ebolavirus outbreak in Guinea and its spread as a "threat to regional security."

Mon 31 Mar 2014
The Health and Social Welfare Minister disclosed that beginning today [31 Mar 2014], the task force would dispatch reinforcement teams to Lofa, Bong and Nimba Counties, and a team would also go to Grand Cape Mount County. Though Grand Cape Mount County does not share a border with Guinea, it borders Sierra Leone; which also shares borders with Guinea and has reported suspected cases of the Ebolavirus.

Meanwhile, Reuters news agency reports that Senegal has closed its southern border with Guinea to prevent the spread of the disease.

["This opens a possibility that some of the people she interacted with on her way and since her arrival in Firestone have also become infected." This would only be the case if she was ill and bleeding or incontinent on the bus journey, or in the household in Firestone. But this case demonstrates that people incubating EBOV can travel from the infected northern border area to the region of the capital, Monrovia.

"Senegal has closed its southern border with Guinea." Anyone who has lived in Africa knows this is impossible. Extended families live on both sides of the frontiers and people travel across unhindered on local footpaths. But all possible actions to stop the spread are commendable. - Mod.JW
