Citrus producers in 5 Martinique municipalities are facing up to the threat of the citrus canker after the disease was detected in the communes of Saint Pierre, Morne-Rouge, Ajoupa-Bouillon, Basse-Pointe and Lorrain.

As a result, the prefecture of Martinique launched an alert. The bacterium, for which there is currently no cure, was 1st detected in the country in 2014, with Martinique the only country in the Caribbean where citrus canker develops.

[Citrus canker (CC) is caused by the bacteria _Xanthomonas axonopodis_ pathovar _citri_ (Xac; synonyms _X. campestris_ pv. _citri_, _X. citri_) or _X. a._ pv. _aurantifolii_ (Xaa), depending on the region. The disease is now present in most citrus growing areas worldwide.

CC affects most commercial citrus varieties as well as other members of the family _Rutaceae_. Different Xac strains can vary in host specificity, for example lime-specific strains which do not affect orange or grapefruit (ProMED-mail post 20170920.5330396). CC can destroy an entire crop and poses a serious economic threat to citrus industries. Symptoms may include blister-like formations (cankers) on fruit, leaves and branches leading to defoliation and premature fruit drop, as well as twig dieback and general tree decline. Although the taste of the fruit is not affected, it cannot be sold or processed.

The bacteria can be transmitted by mechanical means, water or insects within groves, while long-distance spread occurs mostly by infected plant material. Disease management relies mainly on phytosanitation and use of clean planting and grafting material but may also include bacteriocidal sprays and use of less susceptible crop varieties. Planting of windbreaks to reduce the number of insects present in groves that can cause wounds on leaf surfaces serving as ports of pathogen entry may also be used to reduce CC incidence.

Other species in the genus cause important diseases in a range of crops, for example banana xanthomonas wilt (see previous ProMED-mail posts in the archives). Genome sequencing of species and pathovars of _Xanthomonas_ is providing information on mechanisms of bacterial virulence.
