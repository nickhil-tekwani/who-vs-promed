A few more pieces to the puzzle with the permission of our affected
individual.
He lives in NJ and works in NYC (that's enough to make anyone ill IMO).
He has not been tested for histoplasmosis or cryptococcosis. The bats were
getting in through a very small hole that he believes would have precluded
pigeons.
Due to a transfusion in 1980 he is tested every few years for HIV, etc.- so
far all HIV and HEP A,B and C tests where negative as of two weeks ago.
His doctor thinks he may have some type of parasite, due to the high white
cell count and his current symptoms.
He exhibited a fever for several days the first week of April 1998. Here is
his description of the event: "It was the sickest I've ever been in my
life. I could barely get out of bed for the first three days and wound up
with acute sinus, ear and throat infections which lasted another week. The
facial tremors have been more acute over the last three months and the
seizures have been occurring about once a month over the last six months.
For the first six months I would get white flashes when I closed my eyes
for any extended amount of time, especially at bedtime, not so noticeable
now, however, muscle spasms and chest pain has been getting worse."
A new bit of info that probably is important: He spends a lot of time
outdoors, specifically mountain biking, and encounters stagnant water and
swamps. In fact, a few weeks prior to his symptoms, he was biking in a very
damp, swampy area of New York state for a few days and drinking well water
from a campground. His doctor has the travel history for the last two years
as well as his medical records for the last ten years.
The neurologist's report and gave him a clean bill of health based on a
standard neurological physical and basic blood work, except for the
twitching and spasms (The patient can't recall the designation the
neurologist gave to the symptoms).
Another blood test (the physician is doing a series) is scheduled for
August 3rd to check the white cell count and differential again.
I have asked for his out of country travel history, his dietary habits
(raw, undersooked, rare meats or fish), and recollection of tick bites.
(His reply follows:)
Sure, you have my permission to post whatever information you think is
appropriate on the internet. Unfortunately, I tried to contact my doctor
and he is out for the rest of today. I left a message for him to call me
if he calls in. I will try him again Thursday morning when he returns to
the office. Of the diseases I know tested negative:
HIV (several times over the last 15 years, including last week)
Lyme (several times over the last 3 years, including last week)
Hepatitis A, B and C (last week only)
Here are the answers to your last set of questions:
Dietary habits prior to the September 1997 symptoms included sushi (once or
twice per month) and medium/rare meat (once or twice per week). Since the
onset of symptoms in September 1997 I've had a natural urge NOT to indulge
in raw fish or under cooked meat. I generally eat a lot of pasta, salads
and sandwiches for lunch and dinner and plain/plain bagels for breakfast.
Beverages generally consist of V8, OJ, gatorade, milk, non-caffeinated soda
and several beers/glasses of wine every other weekend. No coffee or tea in
the last 10 years. Currently a Non-smoker, smoked cigarettes from the age
of 16 to 25 moderately.
I had to travel to Venezuela and Columbia for business in April of 1998 for
several days but steered clear of tap water for the five days. This trip
occurred after the onset of symptoms. Prior to that I was in Cozumel,
Mexico in 1995 for a week.
I get bitten and cut so often when I mountain bike that I haven't paid
attention to the scars. I've never noticed the infamous 'ring' of a tick
bite associated with Lyme, however, I have pulled about 3 ticks off my body
over the last 10 years. I have not found any ticks on me in the last two
years. I spend an average of 10 hours per week in wooded areas within
northern New Jersey and southern New York State.

This is reminiscent of chronic lead (? other toxin, metal) poisoning - what
was involved in 'renovating' (as in painting/paint-stripping)? What was
stored in the 'attic'?
Suggest consultation with a toxicologist.
