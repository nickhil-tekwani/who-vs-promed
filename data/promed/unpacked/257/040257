Three snow leopards at the Lincoln, Nebraska, Children's Zoo have died from complications due to COVID-19 after multiple animals were infected, the zoo said Friday [12 Nov 2021].

"This loss is truly heartbreaking, and we are all grieving together," the zoo said in a statement on Facebook.

Snow leopards Ranney, Everest, and Makalu tested positive after some exhibited symptoms, the zoo had announced last month [Oct 2021]. The zoo's Sumatran tigers also showed symptoms and tested positive. They appear to have fully recovered.

The animals were treated with steroids and antibiotics, according to the zoo.

"The Zoo has conducted a thorough investigation of all staff that were in close proximity to the felids. There is no evidence to pinpoint the source of the infection," the zoo said last month after the infections were detected.

[Infection by SARS-CoV-2 had been confirmed so far in carnivores of 6 families, canids (dogs and raccoon dogs), felids (cats, tigers, lions, puma/cougars, and snow leopards), mustelids (ferrets and minks), viverrids (binturongs), procyonids (coatimundis), and hyenids (hyenas). All wild carnivores that were diagnosed with COVID-19 were held captive at zoos, except for a free-ranging mink in Utah.

Snow leopards (_Panthera uncia_) have been previously diagnosed with COVID-19 at zoos in San Diego (California), Louisville (Kentucky), and Great Plains (South Dakota) in the USA. One of those cases was fatal, although SARS-CoV-2 could not be confirmed to be the cause of death. In addition to the so far 4 snow leopard deaths suspected to be caused by COVID-19, there were previously 2 tiger cubs and a lioness that presumably died due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. - Mod.PMB
