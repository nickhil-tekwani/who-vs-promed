Bleeding calf syndrome
----------------------
Overview
--------
A bleeding calf syndrome of unknown cause, resulting in high case
fatality rates, has been detected in several European countries. The
syndrome, first detected in Germany in 2007, affects calves from 2 to
4 weeks of age and has been reported in Belgium, England, France,
Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Scotland, and Wales (ProMED
20091006.3465). The syndrome affects beef and dairy calves of various
breeds and crosses.

As of March 2009, more than 100 cases had been reported in Germany
(ProMED-mail 20090329.1214). Scotland has reported 40 cases from 20
farms, mostly in beef herds. 37 cases from 31 farms have been
identified in England and Wales, almost exclusively in dairy herds
(SAC [Scottish Agricultural College] and Surman). Because blood count
changes were detected in asymptomatic calves at affected German
farms, researchers concluded in an October 2009 report that the
undiagnosed problem may be wider spread than originally thought
(Friedrich et al.). Of the asymptomatic calves with blood count
changes, some proceeded to develop clinical signs of the bleeding
calf syndrome, but others remained clinically asymptomatic.

Syndrome details
----------------
Two published case studies indicate that mortality ranges from 3 to 5
percent of calves born on an affected farm (SAC and Penny). The case
fatality rate is reported as approximately 95 percent (Surman).
Antimicrobials, clotting agents, and supportive treatment have been
relatively unsuccessful. In one case report, 2 of 3 calves that
received transfusions died in spite of supportive therapy (SAC). In a
media report, a farmer indicated that vitamins and blood-clotting
agents were not effective (ProMED 20090329.1214). Clinical signs have
been relatively consistent across countries detecting the syndrome:
- persistent pyrexia, fever reaching 41 deg C [105.8 deg F];
- spontaneous hemorrhage from the nares, mouth, rectum, injection, or
tagging sites;
- internal hemorrhage and subcutaneous hematoma formation;
- petechial hemorrhages often present on gums, conjunctiva, and pinnae;
- intestinal bleeding, blood shed with feces;
- severe secondary infections like diarrhea or pneumonia;
- death within a few hours to days after 1st signs observed.

Laboratory findings included:
- variable severity anemia;
- severe thrombocytopenia;
- leucopenia; lymphocytes present, but few, if any, granulocytes;
- clotting times for prothrombin (PT) and activated partial
thromboplastin (APTT) were within normal limits;
- no evidence of bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV); calves
serological positive only if dam vaccinated;

Histopathology results included:
- severe bone marrow hypoplasia;
- severe depletion of hematopoietic precursor cells (consistent with
antemortem pancytopenia);
- widespread hemorrhage;
- lymphoid depletion;
- zero or only a few megakaryocytes;

Necropsy findings included:
- widespread petechial and ecchymotic hemorrhages;
- intestinal intraluminal hemorrhage. Intestinal bleeding commonly in
the form of a cast, suggesting that there was still ability of the
blood to clot;
- massive bleeding of subcutaneous tissue, body cavities, intestines
and other organs;
- bone marrow of jelly-like consistency.

Potential causes
----------------
Bone marrow aplasia, a consistent finding in the bleeding calf
syndrome, can be caused by infectious, toxic, genetic, physical, or
idiopathic factors. Thus, several potential causes of the bleeding
calf syndrome have been proposed in the categories of toxic,
immunologic, and genetic; bacterial infections were ruled out.

Potential toxic causes of the bleeding calf syndrome include plant
toxins, drug toxins, and feed contaminants. Friedrich et al. found no
evidence from affected farms or calves of the following toxic causes
of blood disorders: furazolidone, chloramphenicol, NSAIDs,
sulfonamides, bracken fern, macrocyclic trichothecenes (a class of
mycotoxins), or DCVC (S-[1,2-dichlorovinyl]-L-cysteine), extracted
with trichloroethylene, appearing in soybean meal.

Another potential cause of the bleeding calf syndrome is an
immunologic reaction. Clinical signs observed with the bleeding calf
syndrome are compatible with signs of BVD and bluetongue infection.
Antibodies developed from BVD vaccine and bluetongue vaccine or from
natural exposure could have provoked an autoimmune response. No
evidence of live BVDV or bluetongue virus has been detected in
affected calves. Autoimmune thrombocytopenia due to colostral
antibodies may be unlikely because some calves have been symptomatic
prior to consuming colostrum. A circovirus similar to porcine
circovirus type 2b (PCV2b) was detected in samples of several of the
affected calves in Germany (Kappe et al.).

In Germany, the virologic tests for BVDV and bluetongue have been
negative for affected calves; serology for BVDV and bluetongue was
positive only when the dam had been vaccinated. No evidence of
concurrent BVDV infection was detected in Scottish calves with the
bleeding syndrome. Another reason why BVD is unlikely to be the cause
of the bleeding calf syndrome is that BVD virus-induced hemorrhagic
syndrome is known to be related to the peripheral destruction of
thrombocytes, whereas damage of progenitor cells in bone marrow has
been observed in the bleeding calf syndrome cases.

Although most reports suggest that the bleeding calf syndrome affects
only a few calves on each farm, Wolfgang Klee of the University of
Munich indicated that some clusters of approximately 40 affected
calves have been detected on individual farms (ProMED 20090329.1214).
If an infectious agent is associated with the syndrome, the agent
does not appear to be highly contagious, although calves could be
infected but remain asymptomatic. Media reports have not indicated if
case samples have been tested for viral agents other than BVD and
bluetongue. A French veterinarian recently hypothesized that a
circovirus, such as chicken anemia virus or porcine circovirus, might
have a role in the syndrome (ProMED 20091006.3465). Chicken anemia
virus and porcine circovirus are immunosuppressive viruses that cause
medullar aplasia and hemorrhagic syndrome in chickens and pigs, respectively.

Although a genetic abnormality has been considered as a cause of the
bleeding calf syndrome, it is less likely than an infectious or toxic
cause because beef and dairy cattle of various breeds have been
affected. Idiopathic abnormalities have been identified as previous
causes of bone marrow aplasia in cattle. A report of a Holstein calf
in Japan in 2006 with pancytopenia and a bleeding tendency associated
with bone marrow aplasia was attributed to a congenital disorder or a
drug-induced toxicity (Shimada). A similar case was reported in a
Holstein heifer from Canada in 1996 (Ammann). Although the Canadian
heifer was diagnosed with bone marrow aplasia, a cause was not
determined. Clinical presentation and lab findings of the 2 Holstein
case reports were similar to those for calves observed recently in
Europe with the bleeding syndrome.

The lack of a case definition for the syndrome impedes progress in
determining the cause of the syndrome. The pathogenesis appears to be
complex with multi-factorial components potentially including
infection, genetics, and immune-mediated bone marrow destruction.

Risk to the US cattle industry
------------------------------
Bleeding calf syndrome does not pose a risk to the US cattle industry
through European imports because the United States does not import
cattle from the European Union. Bleeding calf syndrome has been
recognized only since 2007, and the cause has yet to be identified;
therefore, it is difficult to determine if cases may appear beyond Europe.

If the cause of the bleeding calf syndrome is a feed contaminant, it
is possible that the contaminant is widely distributed. The example
of melamine from China, found in multiple brands of pet food and in
baby formula, demonstrates the potential for widespread impact if the
cause is identified as a toxin in feed.

Another possible cause that could have widespread impact is a genetic
abnormality. If a genetic cause is identified, it is possible that
cattle outside of Europe would also experience the syndrome because
cattle semen is shipped throughout the world.

Research in progress
--------------------
Efforts to determine the cause of the bleeding calf syndrome are
continuing throughout Europe. The Scottish Agricultural College (SAC)
and the Veterinary Laboratories Agency (VLA) are offering free
post-mortems for suspected cases. Since April 2009, the Bavarian
State Office of Health and Food Safety has systematically tested milk
and blood (the report did not specify for which agent(s) the tests
are targeted). Research also is continuing at multiple German institutions.

A satellite symposium on the bleeding calf syndrome was planned for 2
Dec 2009 within the framework of the 1st European Buiatrics Forum,
scheduled for 1-3 Dec 2009 in Marseille, France, to consider what is
known about the condition and to identify the best way forward in
collaborative investigation. Available new data presented and outcome
of discussions will be welcomed. - Mod.AS]
