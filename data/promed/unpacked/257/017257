Excerpted from FSNET (D. Powell, Univ. Guelph):
RABBIT NUMBERS IN AUSTRALIA DOWN 65 PER CENT
July 8, 1997
Ontario Farmer
Primary Industries Minister John Anderson said that rabbit numbers have
dropped by more than 65 per cent in dry areas of Australia after the
release of the rabbit calicivirus disease, but results from wetter regions
were more variable. The results were from the first eight months of data
collected as part of the two-year national monitoring and surveillance
program at ten intensive sites across Australia.
