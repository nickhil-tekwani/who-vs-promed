Avian influenza situation in Egypt - update 44
----------------------------------------------
As of Mon 28 Feb 2011, the Ministry of Health of Egypt has announced
3 new confirmed cases of human infection with avian influenza A (H5N1)
virus.

The 1st case is a 26 year-old female from Dakahlia Governorate. She
developed symptoms on 18 Jan 2011 and was hospitalized on 23 Jan 2011.
She has recovered and was discharged on 7 Feb 2011.

The 2nd case is a 45 year-old male from Menofia Governorate. He
developed symptoms on 20 Jan 2011 and was hospitalized on 26 Jan 2011.
He died on 5 Feb 2011.

The 3rd case is a 4 year-old male from Damiata Governorate. He
developed symptoms on 14 Feb 2011 and was hospitalized on 16 Feb 2011.
He is in a stable condition.

Investigations into the source of infection indicate that the 3 cases
had exposure to poultry suspected to have avian influenza. The cases
were confirmed by the Egyptian Central Public Health Laboratories, a
National Influenza Center of the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance
Network.

Of the 125 cases confirmed to date in Egypt, 41 have been fatal.

[The fatal case in Menofia Governorate was reported previously in
ProMED-mail post 'Avian influenza, human (11): Egypt, fatal
20110210.0462.' The cases in Dakahlia and Damiata governorates are new
cases bringing the overall total of cases in Egypt to 125 (with 41
fatalities). 6 of these cases (and one fatality) have occurred during
the 1st 2 months of 2011. None of these cases are known to be
connected and the pattern remains the same -- infection resulting from
direct exposure to diseased poultry.

The WHO Table of the Cumulative Number of Confirmed Human Cases of
Avian Influenza A/(H5N1) has been updated to 28 Feb 2011
(<http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/country/cases_table_2011_02_28/en/index.html>).
The global total now becomes 525 with 310 fatalities. Only Cambodia (3
cases) and Egypt (6 cases) have reported human cases of avian A/(H5N1)
virus infection so far during 2011.
