On Sunday [30 Sep 2007], health authorities said 39 dengue fever
cases have been confirmed in Putian City of east China's Fujian
Province. Thus far, 26 of the 39 patients in Hanjiang District of
Putian City have been cured and the others are in stable condition,
said the provincial health department.
The city has adopted "comprehensive prevention and control measures"
to curb the spread of the disease, said the department. All medical
and health institutions in the province have also strengthened
monitoring on the disease, it added.
The department reminded citizens of household sanitation and the
prevention of proliferation of mosquitoes, which transmit the disease [virus].

The incidence of dengue fever in Viet Nam has risen by almost 50
percent this year [2007] against last year [2006], reports the Health Ministry.
A medical worker instructs Dao ethnic minorities in the northern
mountainous province of Yen Bai's Quang Minh Commune to dip mosquito
nets in chemicals to prevent dengue fever.
About 68 000 people had been stricken with the mosquito-borne
disease, Preventative Health Department director Nguyen Huy Nga said
on Monday [24 Sep 2007]; 60 had died.
Most infections had occurred in southern Dong Thap, An Giang, Tien
Giang, and Ben Tre provinces and the total increase was about 48
percent, he said.
Ho Chi Minh [HCM] City-based Pasteur Institute National Dengue Fever
Programme representative Luong Chan Quang said more than 58 000
people had been infected in the Cuu Long (Mekong) Delta provinces by
the end of August [2007]. Deaths were put at 54-40 percent more than
last year [2006].
Infections in Tien Giang Province totalled 9800 with 9 deaths, Dong
Thap 8700 with 9 deaths, and An Giang 6000 with 6 deaths.
In HCM City, almost 5400 people had been stricken with dengue fever
-- 40 percent more than last year [2006 -- and 6 had died.
Quang warned that another serious outbreak was likely in the southern
delta before the end of the year [2007] if effective preventive
measures were not taken because people regularly stored water to
prepare for the dry season.
The _Aedes_ mosquito, which carries dengue fever, breeds in still or
stagnant water.
HCM City Preventive Health Department deputy director Nguyen Dac Tho
said about 350 people were being admitted to hospital each week with
dengue fever -- 50 more than last year [2006].
Inner city districts 8, 10, 11, Binh Thanh, and Binh Tan were the
worst affected. People in densely populated precincts stored more
water for their own use than others as did construction projects, said Dr Tho.
Dengue fever is most common among children under 10 but the number of
afflicted adults has increased this year [2007].
HCM City Tropical Diseases Hospital figures show that of about 150
people admitted to the hospital with dengue fever each week, more
than 100 were adults.
There are 4 types of the dengue fever virus that often result in
similar symptoms. This year [2007], the transmitted virus was usually
type 1 or type 2.
Haemorrhagic fever is a severe, often fatal, complication of dengue fever.
The HCM City People's Committee has mobilised measures to prevent
dengue fever across the city. Citizens are encouraged to clean around
their residences every Sunday and spray mosquito killer [insecticides].

The Sindh Health Department's Dengue Fever Surveillance Cell reported
22 fresh cases of the disease in select hospitals across Karachi on
Wednesday [26 Sep 2007].
Additional health secretary and in-charge of the surveillance cell,
Dr Shakil Malik, giving details of these cases, told APP [Associated
Press of Pakistan] that 20 of the patients are positive and they are
waiting for the report on the other 2.
The hospitals that dispatched reports include Liaquat National
Hospital, Ziauddin Hospital, Bismillah Taqee Hospital, and Zainab
Panjwani Hospital. "Since we just reactivated the cell on Tuesday [25
Sep 2007], it will take time before we make contact with all the
hospitals scattered across the city," he said. To a question, he said
that around 170 suspected cases of dengue fever have been reported
from across the city this year -- from January [2007] to date. He
also referred to the report the provincial health department received
from a local laboratory (Mid Citi Lab) that tested 24 OPD [out
patient department] patients between August [2007] and now. Of these
individuals, 12 came out positive.

Dengue fever is spreading across Latin America and the Caribbean in
one of the worst outbreaks in decades, causing agonizing joint pain
for hundreds of thousands of people and killing nearly 200 so far
this year [2007].
The mosquitoes that carry dengue are thriving in expanded urban slums
scattered with water-collecting trash and old tires. Experts say
dengue is approaching record levels this year [2007] as many
countries enter their wettest months.
"If we do not slow it down, it will intensify and take a greater
social and economic toll on these countries," said Dr. Jose Luis San
Martin, head of anti-dengue efforts for the Pan American Health
Organization (PAHO), a regional public health agency.
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta
has posted advisories this year [2007] for people visiting Latin
American and Caribbean destinations to use mosquito repellant and
stay inside screened areas whenever possible.
"The danger is that the doctors at home don't recognize the dengue,"
said Dr. Wellington Sun, the chief of the CDC's dengue branch in San
Juan, [Puerto Rico] "The doctors need to raise their level of
suspicion for any traveler who returns with a fever."
Dengue has already damaged the economies of countries across the
region by driving away tourists, according to a document prepared for
a PAHO conference beginning Monday [1 Oct 2007] in Washington.
Some countries have focused mosquito eradication efforts on areas
popular with tourists. Mexico sent hundreds of workers to the resorts
of Puerto Vallarta, Cancun, and Acapulco this year [2007] to try to
avert outbreaks.
Health ministers from across the region meet at the PAHO conference
and San Martin said he will urge them to devote more resources to dengue fever.
The tropical virus was once thought to have been nearly eliminated
from Latin America, but it has steadily gained strength since the
early 1980s. Now, officials fear it could emerge as a pandemic
similar to one that became a leading killer of children in Southeast
Asia following World War II.
Officials say the virus is likely to grow deadlier in part because
tourism and migration are circulating 4 different strains across the
region. A person exposed to one strain may develop immunity to that
strain -- but subsequent exposure to another strain makes it more
likely the person will develop the hemorrhagic form.
"The main concern is what's happening in the Americas will
recapitulate what has happened in Southeast Asia, and we will start
seeing more and more severe types of cases of dengue as time
progresses," Sun said.
So far this year [2007], 630 356 dengue cases have been reported in
the Americas -- most in Brazil, Venezuela, or Colombia -- with 12 147
cases of hemorrhagic fever and 183 deaths, according to the Pan
American Health Organization. With the spread expected to accelerate
during the upcoming rainy season in many countries, cases this year
[2007] could exceed the 1 015 000 reported in 2002, according to San Martin.
In Puerto Rico, where 5592 suspected cases and 3 deaths have been
reported, some lawmakers called this week for the health secretary to resign.
In the Dominican Republic, which has reported 25 deaths this year
[2007], the health department announced Thursday [27 Sep 2007] that
it would train 2.5 million public school students to encourage
parents and neighbors to eliminate standing water.
Researchers have not yet developed a vaccine against dengue and Sun
said that for now, the only way to stop the virus is to contain the
mosquito population -- a task that relies of countless, relentless
individual efforts including installing screen doors and making sure
mosquitoes are not breeding in garbage.
"It's like telling people to stop smoking," he said. "They may do it
for a while, but they don't do it on a consistent basis and without
doing that, it's not effective."
While dengue is increasing around the developing world, the problem
is most dramatic in the Americas, according to the CDC.
Health officials believe the resurgence of the malaria-like illness
is due partly to a premature easing of eradication programs in the 1970s.
Migration and tourism also have carried new strains of the virus
across national borders, even into the United States, which had
largely wiped out the disease after a 1922 outbreak that infected a
half-million people.
Mexico has been struggling with an alarming increase in the deadly
hemorrhagic form of dengue, which now accounts for roughly one in 4
cases. The government has confirmed 3249 cases of hemorrhagic dengue
for the year through 15 Sep [2007], up from 1924 last year [2006].
The CDC says there is no drug to treat hemorrhagic dengue, but proper
treatment, including rest, fluids, and pain relief, can reduce death
rates to about one percent.
San Martin said he use the meetings starting Monday [1 Oct 2007] to
urge enforcement of trash disposal regulations, more investment in
mosquito control and new incentives for communities to participate.
"It is a battle of every government, every community and every
individual," he said.
