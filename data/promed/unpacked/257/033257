Queensland's latest salmonellosis outbreak has caused officials to warn backyard chicken owners to practice biosecurity steps to ensure everyone's safety in handling the animals. Since 26 Jun 2020, 17 cases of _Salmonella enterica_ serotype Typhimurium have been documented. According to ABC News, 13 of the cases were aged 11 or younger. Additionally, 5 out of the 17 cases were admitted to the hospital. The recent outbreak has been associated with chicks from an unnamed supplier.

Queensland Health reported that 8 of the cases were located in South-East Queensland, 6 in Central Queensland, and 3 in the north of the state. The chicks were purchased from a range of pet and produce stores across Queensland 2 weeks before the start of the outbreak. Officials believe that the patients may have likely gotten the infection from handling the chicks. Queensland Health said that an investigation into the supplier of the chicks to the stores is underway.

According to the World Small Animal Veterinary Association, keepers of backyard chickens and other poultry should be made knowledgeable of the risks the animals pose to humans. Furthermore, they should take necessary biosecurity steps to protect against zoonotic disease transmission. Backyard poultry can appear harmless, healthy, and clean but can carry _Salmonella_ spp or _Campylobacter_ spp. Moreover, chicken coops, habitats, and eggs could also become contaminated.

Zoonotic diseases that backyard poultry may transmit to humans include salmonellosis, campylobacteriosis, and avian influenza viruses. Since the 1990s, epidemics of human _Salmonella_ spp infections connected to contact with backyard chickens have been recorded in the USA.

People of all ages -- including children younger than 5 years -- who have weakened immune systems, older adults, and pregnant women are at higher risk of severe illness from zoonotic diseases originating from poultry.

Many locals in Queensland have chickens in their suburban backyards, most probably due to an abundance in space. Queensland Health has warned backyard poultry owners to wash their hands before and after handling the animals, their eggs, and habitats. Moreover, the authority also cautioned owners to keep a close eye on children who might come in contact with the animals and make sure that they practice biosecurity measures. It is also advised to refrain from snuggling or kissing the birds, touching their beaks, or eating and drinking near the animals.

Officials also warn against letting poultry inside the house. Symptoms of salmonella to watch out for include fever, stomach cramps, and diarrhea. According to the CDC, symptoms usually become apparent 6 hours to 6 days after infection.

Furthermore, symptoms may last 4-7 days. However, people develop symptoms at different rates, and some might not experience symptoms for several weeks. _Salmonella_ strains can sometimes cause infection in the urine, blood, joints, bones, or the nervous system. They have the potential to cause severe disease in some cases.
