Bird flu outbreak kills 28 000 chickens in Kyoto
------------------------------------------------
About 28 000 chickens have died in the past week at a chicken farm in the
town of Tamba, Kyoto Prefecture, and preliminary tests have found birds
positive for avian influenza, the prefectural government said Friday.
The Asada Nosan Funai Nojo farm, which raises more than 200 000 chickens
for eggs, said the number of dead chickens totaled 28 000 by Friday. The
farm, however, failed to report to the authorities and had already shipped
about 15 000 live chickens to a meat packing firm in the town of Yachiyo in
the same prefecture on Wednesday and Thursday and about 160 000 eggs per day.
The H5N1 strain of avian flu virus was detected in January 2004 in chickens
at a poultry farm in Yamaguchi Prefecture, in the first bird flu outbreak
in Japan since 1925. In Oita Prefecture, the H5N1 strain of the virus has
been detected among pet bantams.

South Korea Confirms Bird Flu Strain 'Non Lethal'
---------------------------------------------
The strain of bird flu virus that has ravaged South Korea's poultry flocks
is genetically different from that which has killed 22 people and millions
of chickens in Asia, South Korea said yesterday, citing tests by a U.S.
disease control agency.
The tests, conducted by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC), showed the bird flu virus in South Korea was not the same variant of
the H5N1 avian influenza that also killed 6 people in Hong Kong in 1997 and
1998.
"The U.S. CDC's test results showed that South Korea's bird flu virus is a
purely avian influenza virus with no history of affecting humans," a
statement from the state-run Korea Center for Disease Control & Prevention
said.
"The gene test showed that South Korea's bird flu virus differs from that
found in Thailand, Vietnam, and Laos." [From this item it is not clear
whether the S. Korean H5N1 strain has been found "non-lethal" to avians
(thus an LPAI strain) or genetically different from the strains involved in
human cases elsewhere while still being lethal to avians, namely an HPAI
strain. - Mod.AS]
The virulent H5N1 avian influenza virus has hit 8 Asian countries and
killed 15 people from Viet Nam and 7 from Thailand since December 2003. It
has also crossed the species barrier to domestic animals such as house cats
and killed a rare clouded leopard in Thailand.
South Korea first reported an outbreak of the disease among chickens and
ducks on 10 Dec 2003, and a week later the authorities asked the United
States for help to determine the genetic makeup of the virus.
Almost 2000 people living in areas near the 19 poultry farms with reported
outbreaks of the virus were given blood tests as a precaution but none have
shown symptoms of the disease.
The outbreak prompted consumers to shy away from poultry, and exports of
chickens and chicken meat to Japan, Hong Kong, and China were halted.
Prices of chicken meat fell by as much as 40 percent to 611 won (USD 0.522)
per kg after the outbreak was reported, but have jumped to 1.669 won (USD
1.426) per kg due to tight supplies, triggered by a mass poultry slaughter
and import bans, an agriculture ministry official said.
South Korea has slaughtered almost 4.5 million chickens and ducks from its
entire poultry stocks of almost 108 million birds in an effort to contain
the disease, the agriculture ministry said.
The government has halted imports of poultry from 12 countries, including
Taiwan, Japan, Viet Nam, Thailand, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Pakistan,
China, Canada, Hong Kong, and the United States because of bird flu outbreaks.

Vice-Premier reports on bird flu prevention, treatment
---------------------------------------------------
Despite the fact that no new bird flu cases were reported in China in the
past days, Vice-Premier Hui Liangyu said Thursday there is still a chance
of new cases or even human transmission.
That's due to the outbreaks in surrounding countries and the large number
of wild birds migrating and carrying the virus north with them.
In addition, 60 percent of China's 13.2 billion chickens are raised in
small farms, where it is not uncommon for them to live in close quarters
with domestic animals and people. In addition, quarantine conditions in
many places are not as strict as they should be.
Hui spoke about the country's bird flu situation during Thursday's 7th
session of the Standing Committee of the 10th National People's Congress.
The Chinese Government, he said, has approved a veterinarian bureau and a
chief veterinarian system to be set up by the Ministry of Agriculture.
At the same time, the country will give support to large-scale poultry
farms and encourage the adoption of modern methods in raising poultry, Hui
said.
Also Thursday, isolation of 6 bird flu epidemic areas were ended, according
to the Ministry of Agriculture.
The areas include the Chenggong County of Kunming, capital of Southwest
China's Yunnan Province, Ezhou and Wuxue in Central China's Hubei Province,
the Guangde County, Jieshou and Yingzhou District in Huyang in East China's
Anhui Province.
In another development, inspection and quarantine departments in China were
called upon to thoroughly check export-oriented avian meat manufacturers
and poultry farms to ensure that exported avian products are safe, China
Central Television (CCTV) reported.
Avian meat companies will be checked to see whether the bird flu virus can
be found within a 50-kilometre radius and whether they have established
effective quarantine systems.
The farms were also required to prevent birds and rats from coming into
contact with the chickens.
The Certification and Accreditation Administration will force companies
that do not meet standards to catch up quickly, reported CCTV. The
administration will suspend export certificates for companies that fail to
improve their conditions.
By Wednesday, 16 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities had
reported 52 bird flu cases, of which 49 have been confirmed. A total of 143
000 chickens have caught the virus and 128 000 of them have died.
To prevent bird flu from spreading, more than 8.5 million poultry had been
slaughtered by Wednesday and more than 12 million were quarantined.
The central government has attached great importance to the control of bird
flu, the report said. Efforts include the allocation of 100 million yuan
(USD 12 million) for research on prevention and control.
According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Organization of Food and
Agriculture (FAO) has approved an urgent technical co-operative project to
help China conduct interchanges between experts on bird flu.
With the FAO and the World Health Organization, China's Ministry of
Agriculture has established a system for distributing information on the
epidemic situation.
China has provided countries like Viet Nam and Thailand with USD 450 000
for emergency aid, and the Ministry of Agriculture has recently offered
Viet Nam aid materials worth 200 000 yuan (USD 4000), including exposure
suits and gloves, according to the ministry.

Malaysians are eating more chicken as bird flu fears ease
---------------------------------------------------------
Malaysians are eating more chicken, as fears subside that bird flu is going
to break out in the country, giving relief to local producers who watched
prices slump in recent weeks.
Kamarudin Mohamad Isa, the head of Malaysia's Disease Control and
Veterinary Biologics Unit, said the price of chicken in Malaysia was
recovering since plummeting in recent weeks because of disease fears.
Prices were also rising because breeders reduced their supply of chicken
products into the market during the scare, creating a shortage, Kamarudin said.
"There may be a slight contribution from that to the price increase, but
it's up because demand is improving, indicating that consumer confidence is
back," Kamarudin told The Associated Press.
The government says Malaysia remains free of the avian influenza that has
swept through at least 10 Asian countries in recent months, killing 22
people and causing the slaughter of millions of fowl.
Chicken is a staple in many Asian countries, but consumption plummeted in
recent months because of disease fears. Malaysia's Deputy Prime Minister
Najib Razak and other leaders in the region have publicly eaten a variety
of chicken dishes in an effort to allay public concerns.

Health experts gather in Bangkok to tackle bird flu
---------------------------------------------------
About 140 officials and international experts from 23 Asia-Pacific
countries began a 3-day emergency meeting in Bangkok on Thursday to
determine measures to contain the avian influenza outbreak that has spread
through much of the world and killed 22 people in Asia.
The meeting is jointly organized by Thailand's Ministry of Agriculture and
Cooperatives, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the World
Organization for Animal Health (OIE), and the World Health Organization.

[Hopefully, the current timely meeting will be successful in achieving
improved and efficient arrangements in all countries involved, to enhance
better understanding of the epidemiology behind the HPAI epizootic in
Eastern Asia. It is essential that virus isolates from all geographic areas
and from all species involved -- man, unfortunately, included -- be
forwarded to the relevant internationally recognised reference
laboratories, and be serologically and genetically studied/compared.
Since vaccination seems to be inevitable in controlling the disease in some
of the affected countries, internationally coordinated selection of the
vaccine strains used and strict control of the production procedures of the
vaccines to safeguard their safety and efficacy, are vital. OIE's Manual of
Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines for Terrestrial Animals (Chapter 2.1.14.
could be consulted. (<http://oie.int/eng/normes/mmanual/A_00035.htm>)
