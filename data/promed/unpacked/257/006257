A Virginia Department of Health spokesman says 2 recent rabies in the
Roanoke area don't appear to be related. Robert Parker says the cases
indicate the disease's presence in the area.

The health department confirmed that a red fox in Roanoke and a
raccoon in the 3000 block of Cawtawba Valley Drive in Roanoke County
had rabies. Both animals were found last week [week of 3 may 2010].

[The article does not tell us much, except a fox and a raccoon were
found with rabies. It would be very helpful if we knew the strain of
rabies in each. It may even tell us if these cases were related any
way. Regardless, vaccination for all pets should be emphasized by the
local health departments and the local veterinarians. - Mod.TG]
