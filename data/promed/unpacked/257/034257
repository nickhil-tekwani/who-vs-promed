Preparing ground beef for safe consumption
------------------------------------------
Although these products are not available at retail establishments,
consumers preparing ground beef products should heed the following advice.
- Wash hands with warm, soapy water for at least 20 seconds before
and after handling raw meat and poultry. Wash cutting boards, dishes,
and utensils with hot, soapy water. Immediately clean spills.
- Keep raw meat, fish, and poultry away from other food that will not
be cooked.
- Use separate cutting boards for raw meat, poultry, and egg products
and cooked foods.
- Consumers should only eat ground beef or ground beef patties that
have been cooked to a safe internal temperature of 160 deg F (71 deg C).
- Color is NOT a reliable indicator that ground beef or ground beef
patties have been cooked to a temperature high enough to kill harmful
bacteria such as _E. coli_ O157:H7.
- The only way to be sure ground beef is cooked to a high enough
temperature to kill harmful bacteria is to use a thermometer to
measure the internal temperature.
- Refrigerate raw meat and poultry within 2 hours after purchase or
one hour if temperatures exceed 90 deg F (32 deg C). Refrigerate
cooked meat and poultry within 2 hours after cooking.
