More people are reporting illnesses related to a salmonella outbreak
connected to the Taste of Chicago [festival]. As of noon Tue 17 Jul
2007, a total of 636 people reported they became sick after they ate
food purchased from the Pars Cove Persian Cuisine booth, according to
the Chicago Department of Public Health. That's up from the 529
reported cases on the day before [16 Jul 2007]. Of the 636, 66 are
laboratory-confirmed cases of salmonellosis, with more results
pending, up from the 50 reported the day before.
Commissioner Terry Mason, MD said the increase in reported cases is a
result of the city's outreach efforts. "We take foodborne illness
very seriously, and we have moved swiftly to alert people to the
dangers of salmonella infection, so that they may protect themselves
and take measures to prevent secondary spread of their illness,"
Mason said.
The only dish linked so far to the outbreak is an herb, tomato, and
cucumber salad that was served on hummus, according to health
officials. As a precaution, Pars Cove has been asked to stop serving
hummus.

[It is still likely that the number of cases has continued to grow
from more recognition, probably not more transmission. The festival
has been over for more than a week, ending on 8 Jul 2007. - Mod.LL]
