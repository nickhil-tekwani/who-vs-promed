The moderator's instructive comment about methanol is correct but
neglects 2 points commonly taught in this toxic topic.
Better than ethanol, Fomepizole (4-methylpyrazole, Antizol) inhibits
alcohol dehydrogenase and does not trigger delirium, fetal risks,
liver injury, gastropathy, or frequent vomiting.

Also, Folinic acid (leucovorin) is recommended for restoration of
1-carbon metabolism, especially for methanol exposure.

[Gary is correct in stating that 4-methylpyrazole will inhibit
alcohol dehydrogenase without the noted side effects. I appreciate
the reminder, as it was an oversight not to include it. - Mod.TG]
