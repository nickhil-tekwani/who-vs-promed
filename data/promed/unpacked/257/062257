Measles is currently affecting several French regions and the rapid increase in the number of cases since the beginning of the year [2018] may give rise to fears of another major epidemic throughout the country, French health officials report this [week of Sun 18 Mar 2018].

Since our last report one week ago, the number of measles cases in France has increased by more than 150 cases, bringing the total since early November 2017 to 1077 cases.

This situation is the consequence of inadequate vaccination coverage for infants (79 percent with 2 doses of vaccine instead of the 95 percent needed), children and young adults. Up to 87 percent of measles cases occurred in unimmunized or poorly vaccinated patients.

Up to 64 departments are affected by measles with 47 percent of cases are reported in the Nouvelle-Aquitaine region.

Public Health France reminds the public of the need for a very high vaccination coverage in the population (at least 95 percent with 2 doses of vaccine in children and young adults). Such collective protection would eliminate the disease and its complications and thus also protect the most fragile people who cannot be vaccinated themselves (infants under one year of age, pregnant women, immunocompromised people). It is therefore imperative that all persons born after 1980 have received 2 doses of vaccine.

As from [Mon 1 Jan 2018], vaccination against measles is mandatory for infants, who should receive a dose of the combined measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) at 12 months of age and a 2nd dose between 16 and 18 months.

A total of 712 people have fallen ill with measles in Ukraine over the past week [week of Sun 18 Mar 2018], the Health Ministry's press service reports.

"According to the data provided by the Public Health Center of the Health Ministry of Ukraine, 712 people fell ill over the 12th week of 2018: 283 adults and 429 children. Some 8434 people fell ill with measles over 1st 12 weeks of 2018: 2956 adults and 5478 children," reads the report.

In addition, 7 people have died of complications from measles: 5 children and 2 adults.

The largest number of cases of measles was recorded in Ivano-Frankivsk (1760), Zakarpattia (1513), Odesa (1139), Chernivtsi (800), and Lviv (756) regions. The smallest number of number of cases of measles was recorded in Luhansk (4), Sumy (5), Kharkiv (11), and Kherson (13) regions.

Public Health England (PHE) is urging people in Surrey and Sussex to check they are up-to-date with 2 doses of MMR [measles, mumps, rubella] vaccine.

The call comes following 34 cases of measles in the region since late January [2018]. A further 23 individuals are being investigated as possible measles cases.

PHE is working closely with NHS [National Health Service] and local authority partners to raise awareness of how the public can play their part in protecting themselves and their families, and prevent further cases.

For more information about measles, which can be very unpleasant and lead to serious complications particularly for pregnant women and children, see the website http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/measles.

A total of 6 new cases of measles are being linked to a passenger on an AirAsia flight D7214 from Kuala Lumpur to Melbourne on [Wed 7 Mar 2018].

The new cases include a baby who was too young to be immunised and 5 adults ranging in age from 20--60.

All of them were in the international baggage area of Melbourne Airport when the flight arrived about 9:30am.

The initial case of measles was tracked to an Australian man in his 40s who became unwell on the flight and went straight to hospital where he was diagnosed.

Measles is a highly infectious viral disease which can cause serious illness, including pneumonia and other complications in the very young and very old.

The symptoms are similar to the common cold followed by fever and rash, which can begin 3--7 days after the 1st symptoms show.

Measles is relatively uncommon because of the widespread use of the vaccine, but can be brought into Australia from overseas travellers.

This case is one of several measles outbreaks in Victoria this year [2018], including one linked to a British backpacker and another a flight between Denpasar, Sydney and Melbourne.

A Brisbane man has been diagnosed with the highly infectious measles virus in the 4th case recorded in Queensland this year [2018].

The Metro North Public Health Unit said the man had travelled on public transport on 19 and 20 Mar [2018] while he unknowingly had the virus.

Public health physician James Smith [listed the locations where people should be alert for measles symptoms. - see URL above]

Measles complications can include pneumonia and encephalitis, inflammation of the brain, which can be life threatening.

Dr Smith said measles was one of the most infectious of all communicable diseases and was spread by tiny droplets generated by coughing and sneezing.

After being the 1st continent in the world declared free of measles in 2016, 9 countries in the region have registered cases last year [2017]. With almost 900 cases, Venezuela was the most affected. The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) warns that the countries of the region should intensify their efforts to immunize the population and stop the spread of the disease.

The region had finally been declared free of the disease by an International Committee of Experts in 2016 after 22 years of mass vaccination. However, the virus was still active around the planet and the risk of the appearance of new outbreaks in the region was feared.

Thus, in 2017, 4 countries in the region already reported cases of measles: Argentina, Canada, the United States and Venezuela. And so far this year [2018], 9 countries have registered: Antigua and Barbuda, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, the United States, Guatemala, Mexico, Peru and Venezuela.

With a serious shortage of medicines and an unprecedented humanitarian crisis, Venezuela is the most affected country with 886 cases between last year [2017] and this one [2018], followed by Brazil with 14 and the United States with 13.

In Brazil and Colombia, the origin of all of their cases comes from unvaccinated Venezuelan citizens.

There is also concern about cases in Europe when the disease quadruples between 2016 and 2017, a situation that increases the risk of importing cases in the Americas, reports PAHO.

The action plan adopted in 2017 to maintain the elimination of measles indicates that the population's immunization levels should be 95 percent or higher. Regional coverage of the 1st dose of measles, rubella, and mumps vaccine [MMR] has been between 92 percent and 94 percent over the past 5 years.

PAHO disseminated a series of recommendations:

- Vaccinate to maintain equal coverage of 95percent with the 1st and 2nd doses of the measles, rubella and mumps vaccine.

- Strengthen epidemiological surveillance to detect suspicious cases in public and private health services.

- Offer a rapid response when detecting imported cases of measles to avoid the reestablishment of the endemic transmission of the virus, including the activation of teams that follow up cases and their contacts.

- Conserve reserves of measles-rubella (SR) vaccine for control actions of imported cases in each country of the region.

[7] Argentina (Buenos Aires)

The Ministry of Health of Buenos Aires confirmed that an 8-month-old baby contracted measles, which is the 1st case of the virus in Argentina in nearly 2 decades.

The baby does not have references or travel and was not previously vaccinated because she was not 12-months old yet, so it is the 1st indigenous case of this disease, and warnings about its spread worry the government of the capital.

It was not until last [Sun 18 Mar 2018] when the girl began presenting eruptions, reddish skin, and was not hospitalized until [Mon 19 Mar 2018]. She previously only had minor symptoms such as cough and fever, which did not worry her parents.

In Argentina, an indigenous case of measles has not been diagnosed since 2000, so this episode is a warning for the entire health system.

Doctors warned that we must be alert to symptoms - fever, cough, skin blemishes, rashes and conjunctivitis - manifested 2 days after contracting the virus.

Only this case is known and work is being done "to identify the source of the contagion "and to check that there are no more diagnosed cases.

The measles outbreak in eastern Kansas is continuing to be investigated. Since [Thu 8 Mar 2018], 13 cases have been identified - 11 Johnson County residents, one Linn County resident and one Miami County resident.

Please be aware that if a person has visited one or more of the locations [listed in the URL above], on the dates and times listed, they may have been exposed to measles.

Locations where individuals may have been exposed to measles, and can be identified, are not listed. Those individuals have been notified separately.

Also, listed [at the URL above] are dates after which persons exposed at a specific location would be outside the timeframe to develop symptoms of measles.

To date, KDHE [Kansas Department of Health and Environment] along with the Johnson County Department of Health and Environment, Linn County Department of Health, and the Miami County Department of Health have been able to identify where and when each case became infected. KDHE urges people who are ill or exhibiting measles-like symptoms to stay at home unless they are seeking medical care. Before visiting a healthcare provider, call ahead and let the provider know of the measles exposure so that the measures can be taken to protect other patients and staff.

This outbreak continues to be investigated and KDHE and county health departments are working to identify contacts. The average number of days between when a person is exposed to measles, and when they 1st start showing symptoms is approximately 10 -- 14 days (range of 7 -- 21 days). Secondary cases are now appearing outside of the daycare. There is concern that some individuals in the general population may have potentially been exposed to persons with measles while they were infectious.

Measles is a respiratory disease caused by a virus. Measles is spread through the air by breathing, coughing or sneezing. Measles can be spread to others from 4 days before to 4 days after the rash appears. Measles cannot be spread to others by people who do not have the disease.

The best way to prevent measles is to get the MMR vaccine. Currently, KDHE is not recommending any changes to the routine vaccination schedule. If you have had measles or have been vaccinated, your risk of contracting the disease is extremely low.

Because measles is a highly infectious disease, it is very important, if a person has been exposed and is starting to experience symptoms, that they stay home except to see a healthcare provider and limit their contact with people.

For questions call the Johnson County Department of Health and Environment or the KDHE Epidemiology hotline.
