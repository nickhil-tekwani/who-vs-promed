When a man had a little money saved, over 10 years ago, he installed a handpump outside his small house in Badhariya village. The 1st he heard of the handpump being too shallow was when his 9-year-old daughter died of encephalitis this year [2012] and the grieving father was told it was because of the water she had drunk from the handpump.

With water-borne acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) now making up close to 95 per cent of the encephalitis cases across eastern Uttar Pradesh, there is a renewed focus on the water the area's children are drinking. "The big problem in this area is that since it is low-lying and surrounded by rivers, the water table is very high, which makes contamination easier," says Gorakhpur's district magistrate Ravi Kumar NG.

Milind Gore, who heads the National Institute of Virology's Gorakhpur research unit, says water samples taken by them near handpumps in affected areas have shown the presence of enteroviruses, which can cause AES.

An important part of the administration's work to prevent encephalitis is discouraging people from using these handpumps and installing India Mark II pumps. "We have been sanctioned Rs 160 crore [USD 34 309 018] for improving drinking water, through which 4600 handpumps are being installed in Gorakhpur district alone," says Kumar.

But while the shallow handpump is now accepted as the villain in the piece, residents say they had to take no permissions while installing handpumps, many of them up to 25 years ago. "We got the contractor to put in a handpump, and when he hit water, he stopped. How would village people know how deep to put it in?" says a man, whose brother lost his infant daughter to AES 12 days ago.

"No one has ever told us there is any problem with our handpump," says a woman of Bargadahi village in Gorakhpur. Her 6-year-old daughter was hospitalized with AES a month ago but has largely recovered. The entire family still drinks water from the same handpump outside their house.

In other villages, some of the deeper handpumps installed by the government are located inside the compounds of the better off, often upper caste, residents of the village, a problem the district administration too acknowledges. Against this backdrop, the Centre's continued insistence on improved handpumps in an area in which groundwater poses problems seems fraught with danger.

[Conflicting reports of the etiology of these acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) cases continue. The above report, and several previous ones of AES, have associated the disease with contaminated water, implying enterovirus etiology. The above report, for the 1st time, explicitly states that enteroviruses are responsible, with improved pumps being offered as the preventive approach.

However, the 16 Oct 2012 report stated, "The doctors said that viral encephalitis is caused by insect or mosquito bites [that transmit a virus]. Now, the medical, health and family welfare department has stepped up anti-mosquito activities in the area. Medical department sources said that directions have been issued to medical officials in Alwar to carry out fogging and other anti-larvae activities and other measures to kill mosquitoes and insects," to prevent transmission of Japanese encephalitis virus (See ProMED-mail archive no .20121016.1347211). Previous reports also indicated that JEV was responsible for a significant proportion of the AES cases treated.

At least 390 people, mostly children, were reported in an outbreak of viral encephalitis in UP this year as of 4 Oct 2012, according to health authorities. At that time, more than 2500 patients were admitted to government hospitals in Gorakhpur city (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20121005.1325059). Fatalities at that time increased to 433.
