Parasite Infects Yukon River King Salmon
----------------------------------------
A parasite that is infecting Yukon River king salmon is on the increase,
leaving the fish virtually inedible with a fruity odor and ruined meat.

The illness, caused by a common microorganism that targets ocean fish, was
detected in about 35 percent of king salmon sampled in 2002 and 2003, said
Richard Kocan, a fish pathologist overseeing a study for the federal Office
of Subsistence Management. He said that's a significant increase over the
number of infected fish found in 1999, 2000, and 2001.

"This is a statistical red flag that something is going on," Kocan told the
Federal Subsistence Board on Tuesday. "If this persists, you may be looking
at evidence that the infection is spreading."

Global warming may play a role too, possibly explaining why the outbreak
occurred in the first place, Kocan said. Some Yukon king salmon now spend
June and July migrating upstream through water warmed to 59 degrees or
higher, temperatures that allow the parasite to spread faster and kill its
hosts more quickly. "Some of these fish are swimming within a few degrees of
lethal temperatures for healthy salmon, and we know many of them are
infected," he said.

The disease was first noticed in a few stray king salmon in the mid-1980s,
but grew much worse in the late 1990s. The culprit turned out to be a common
protozoan called ichthyophonus.

"Many fish were unsuitable for human consumption," Kocan said, "because
they smelled bad, they didn't dry right, and their taste was off."

The pathogen has recently been detected in salmon in the Kuskokwim and Taku
rivers, but it is not clear that it is precisely the same species found in
the Yukon chinook, according to Kocan's report.

The overall impact of the infection on the health of Interior Alaska's most
famous fish run remains unclear. In 2003, an estimated 254 000 kings swam
into the river past a sonar counter in Pilot Station, the highest number in
years. After several years of poor or declining harvests, subsistence
fishermen in villages along 1000 river miles took home more than 50 000
king salmon, while a commercial fishery caught 41 000, said state management
biologist Tracy Lingnau. So many fish were caught it may have been a record
year.

Scientists need to find out as much as possible about the disease and
whether catches must be reduced to make sure enough fish reach spawning
grounds, said Russ Holder, with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. "We
need to be proactive about this," he said. "We don't want (people to
perceive) Yukon fish are sick."

Kocan said infected fish could be safely eaten. "They taste bad, they
smell bad, and they look bad, but if you're starving, go ahead and eat
them," he said.

[_Ichthyophonus hoferi_ is a parasite that infects most organs and tissues
of many marine fish. The disease caused is of economic significance,
because epizootics have resulted in mass mortality of commercial fish
species such as Atlantic herring (_Clupea harengus_ L.). Although systemic
infections are lethal, variations in pathogenic effects -- including
myositis, or muscle inflammation -- have been observed, depending upon the
particular isolate of _I. hoferi_ and the host species involved. - Mod.TG]
