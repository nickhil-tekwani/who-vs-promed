The North Dakota Department of Health (NDDoH) is reporting a case of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) in an individual in eastern North Dakota. Testing performed at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirmed the individual was infected with [a] hantavirus. The individual was hospitalized but has since recovered.

"People are most often exposed to hantavirus when they inhale dust while cleaning or occupying previously vacant cabins, sheds, or other dwellings and outbuildings that contain rodents, rodent droppings, and rodent nests," said Levi Schlosser, epidemiologist with the NDDoH Division of Epidemiology and Infectious Diseases. "Currently, only supportive treatment exists for hantavirus disease, so it is important to be wary of rodent infestations to properly prevent infection."

HPS is a viral infection that can cause severe lung disease, including pneumonia. Typically, infected rodents spread the virus in their urine, droppings, and saliva. The virus is transmitted when someone breathes in air contaminated by the virus, and on rare occasions, it can be transmitted by the bite of an infected rodent, such as the deer mouse.

As the weather begins to change, people may be cleaning cabins, sheds, and other outdoor buildings that could be infested with rodents. Cabins, sheds, and other outdoor buildings that could be harboring rodents are places where exposure to hantavirus is more likely to occur. NDDoH offers the following tips to avoid hantavirus infection when cleaning a building with signs of rodent infestation:
- Ventilate the space by opening the doors and windows for 30 minutes before you start cleaning.
- Wear gloves and use disinfectant when cleaning up dead rodents or their urine, droppings, and nests.
- Saturate the material with disinfectant for at least 5 minutes before removal.
- Mop floors and clean countertops, cabinets, and drawers with disinfectant.
- Use a commercial disinfectant registered with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and follow the label instructions or use a bleach solution made with one part bleach and 9 parts water.
- Do not stir up dust by sweeping or vacuuming up droppings, urine, or nesting materials.
- Do not let children play in crawl spaces or vacant buildings where rodents may be present.

Symptoms of HPS usually begin 2-3 weeks after infection. Early symptoms commonly include fever, muscle and body aches, fatigue, headache, dizziness, chills, nausea, and vomiting. Within a short period of time, symptoms will worsen to include coughing and shortness of breath as lungs fill with fluid. People with HPS are typically hospitalized.

The virus was first recognized in the United States in 1993. Since that time, there have been 19 cases of HPS reported to the NDDoH, including this current case. Of these, 3 cases were in children and 8 of the 19 reported cases were fatal. Nationally, 833 cases have been reported, with 35% resulting in death, through December 2020.

[Although this is the 1st case of a hantavirus infection in North Dakota this year (2022), previous cases of hantavirus infections were posted on ProMED in 2018 and 2016. The report above does not indicate the circumstances under which the patient was exposed and infected.

The hantavirus involved in this, and other cases in the western USA, is Sin Nombre virus. Fatalities are due to hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HPS). HPS can be very serious, and patients developing the symptoms should seek medical attention at the earliest possible time.

Infected rodents shed the virus in feces, urine, and saliva. Individuals opening up cabins or storage areas that have been closed over winter or cleaning areas with signs of rodent presence should heed the precautions that the CDC recommends in order to avoid exposure to the virus (https://www.cdc.gov/rodents/cleaning/index.html).

Deer mice, _Peromyscus maniculatus_, are the reservoir hosts of the virus. An image of the deer mouse, _P. maniculatus_, can be seen at http://www.nsf.gov/news/mmg/media/images/mouse_f.jpg. - Mod.TY
