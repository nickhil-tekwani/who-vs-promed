A village in Thuraiyur block [Tiruchirappalli district, Tamil Nadu], where some people were suspected to have contracted chikungunya, is completely under the control of medical teams. Health officials said after 7 men developed high temperature with unbearable joint pain, they collected blood samples. They later ascertained it to be chikungunya.

The people of Maaradi village were infected with fever on [12 Sep 2014], following which medical teams rushed to the spot and conducted camps in which around 31 people were diagnosed with viral fever. They were placed under observation in the Uppliyapuram PHC. "We discharged 25 people following treatment, after which they did not show any symptoms of fever. However, 7 people developed high fever with joint pain, in an indication of chikungunya," said Dr Raveendran, deputy director of health services.

They have taken samples from the 7 persons and sent it for lab tests. They were later discharged. The officials attributed the fever to unhygienic conditions and health staff have been deployed to ensure source reduction in all households. "When we visited the houses, we found the conditions to be squalid, after which our staff began the source reduction process," Raveendran said, adding that they would conduct medical camps in the village until fears over the mysterious fever were put to rest.

Meanwhile, ahead of the upcoming monsoons, medical experts warned the public to keep their surroundings clean. "2 months ago, a group of villagers in Manapparai taluk [Tiruchirappalli district, Tamil Nadu] were affected by chikungunya and we found the reason to be unclean surroundings. In the village of Thuraiyur taluk also it was the same problem," said Raveendran. The City Health Officer said authorities were taking necessary steps, to contain chikungunya and dengue fever.

[Chikungunya virus is endemic in India. There were scattered outbreaks of chikungunya virus infections in several localities around India last year (2013). A report last year was the 1st one of an outbreak in Tamil Nadu state that has come to ProMED's attention. Now, we have the 2nd outbreak report there. It is not clear whether the diagnoses of chikungunya virus infection is based solely on clinical grounds or whether some or all cases are laboratory diagnosed as well. Cleaning or eliminating water containers is a prudent way to affect vector mosquito control. One hope that the intensive cleanup campaign being launched successfully reduces the numbers of vector mosquitoes and transmission rates.
