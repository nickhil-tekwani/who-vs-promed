The Para Health Department reported having reported 12 cases of human rabies in the state, including 6 deaths. So far, at least one case has been confirmed.

According to the agency, a patient died yesterday afternoon [Tue 15 May 2018] at the Hospital Regional de Breves. Four children are hospitalized at Santa Casa de Misericordia in Belem and one at the Breves Regional Hospital, which also serves an adult with suspected illness. Most patients remain in a serious condition.

By means of a note, the secretariat said that it continues the work of research and prevention of human rabies in the municipality of Melgaco, in the Marajo Archipelago. Last [Mon 14 May 2018], 1000 doses of rabies vaccine and 300 bottles of antirabies serum were sent to the region. The actions are concentrated in the locality of Rio Laguna, about 70 kilometers [43.49 mi approx.] from Melgaco, where approximately 1000 people live. So far, 500 people have been vaccinated.

Still according to the state government, serological collections were performed on all patients - including those who died - and referred to the Pasteur Institute, in Sao Paulo, a reference laboratory for the diagnosis of human rabies. Since the last day 4 teams of epidemiological surveillance and health surveillance are in place to investigate the suspicions, in partnership with the Agricultural Defense Agency of Para and the Ministry of Health.

All cases reported by the Department of Health as suspects for human rabies present a similar picture, with signs and symptoms such as fever, dyspnea, headache, abdominal pain and neurological signs such as ascending flaccid paralysis, convulsion, dysphagia (difficulty swallowing), disorientation, hydrophobia and hyperacusis (sensitivity to sounds, mainly acute).

Confirmed cases of human rabies in Para have not occurred since 2005, when 15 cases were recorded in the municipality of Augusto Correa and three in Viseu (northeastern Paraguay) - all of them transmitted by a blood-sucking bat.

In 2004, Portel (municipality of Marajo) recorded 15 cases of the disease - all also by hematophagous bats, as well as the 6 cases confirmed in Viseu in the same year.

All the confirmed cases in these 2 periods, according to the secretariat, evolved to death.

[Between 2010 and 2017 "only" 25 human cases of rabies were reported in Para. But in this 2018 report there are at least 11 suspected or confirmed cases, so this is a really relevant epidemiological event in the Brazilian scenario - a possible rabies outbreak.

Although this article does mention the events as being bat-related, there is no definitive information as to whether hematophagous species, such as vampire bats, are involved. The transmission may have a pattern regarding location, how widespread and the number of cases that could possibly link it to vampire bats. More information from appropriate sources have been sought, but as of this posting there has not yet been a reply.

Most often we associate deforestation with bats looking for a new home area and hunting grounds. Most often during deforestation we have many cattle deaths as the relocating bats stop for a meal. We have not yet had reports of rabies in cattle in this area.
