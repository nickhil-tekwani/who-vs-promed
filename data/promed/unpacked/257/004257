I have the following response to "VANCOMYCIN RESISTANT STAPHYLOCOCCUS
AUREUS - CHINA (HONG KONG) (03)" posted on Friday 5 Nov 1999
The findings of our study were published in Clin Infect Dis 1999;29:760-7.
The term VRSA used by the report refers to vancomycin-hetero-resistant _S.
aureus_. Although the South China Morning Post report has already stated
this out at the end of the report, it still confuses some of the local
clinicians who are not researching in this field.
The current terminology for staphylococci with reduced susceptibility to
glycopeptides still needs refinement, as different breakpoints are used by
different investigators. Whereas the NCCLS breakpoint for vancomycin
resistance is 32 microgram/ml, a vancomycin MIC of 8 microgram/ml was used
by Hiramatsu K et al. (Lancet 1997;350:1670-3) for both VRSA and
hetero-VRSA. To my knowledge, Guatemala at present is the only place with
high level vancomycin resistant (MIC >32 mcg/ml) _S. aureus_ (ICAAC 1999,
Abstract 2084). Strains with intermediate level resistance to vancomycin
have been reported from France, Japan and the United States. Terms like
vancomycin intermediate _S. aureus_ (VISA), glycopeptide-intermediate _S.
aureus_ (GISA) have been used to refer to the latter strains.
At present, the clinical significance of both VISA and hetero-VRSA remain
not clear. In Hong Kong, the prevalence ratios of MRSA in most hospitals
are very high (30-60%), necessitating the increasing use of vancomycin. As
such, hetero-VRSA should not be ignored as Sieradzki K et al recently
reported that VISA can emerged in vivo from hetero-VRSA (New England
Journal of Medicine 1999;340:517-523).

Reports that vancomycin resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_ (VRSA) has
emerged in Hong Kong, that it has caused the deaths of 4 persons, and that
Hong Kong is the now the fourth place that such organisms have been found,
should be interpreted with some perspective. If true, this is certainly an
alarming development. However, _Staphylococcus aureus_ that are truly
resistant to therapeutically achievable blood
levels of vancomycin have not been isolated from patients - only organisms
that exhibit intermediate (i.e. reduced) sensitivity.
Before grouping the Hong Kong outbreak with earlier outbreaks of these
organisms with intermediate sensitivity, sensitivity testing must be
performed in the same way that earlier organisms were tested, and the
characteristic morphological features should be verified.
The testing method used in the published report that was mentioned:
Bacteremia caused by staphylococci with inducible vancomycin
heteroresistance. Wong SSY, Ho PL, Woo PCY, Yuen KY. Clinical Infectious
Diseases 29:760-767, Oct 1999
was a disk-agar method - not an optimal method, and not comparable to the
method used to define the other cases. It also hasn't been made clear that
the cause of death in any of these four patients is actually the infection
and not their underlying
diseases.

FYI, for those interested, there is also an excellent discussion of the
concept of heterogeneity of resistance in Hiramatsu's 1998 review paper:
Hiramatsu, K (1998) Vancomycin resistance in Staphylococci. Drug Resistance
Updates 1:135-150.
