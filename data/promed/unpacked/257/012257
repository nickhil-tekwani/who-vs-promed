[With the continuing decline of the number of cases in the human
population of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease -- abbreviated
previously as vCJD or CJD (new var.) in ProMED-mail -- it has been
decided to broaden the scope of the occasional ProMED-mail updates to
include other prion-related diseases. In addition to vCJD, data on
other forms of CJD: sporadic, iatrogenic, familial, and GSS
(Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease) are included also since they
may have some relevance to the incidence and etiology of vCJD. -

The number of deaths due to definite or probable vCJD as of 6 Jun
2011 remains 171. A total of 4 definite/probable patients remain
alive, so the total number of definite or probable vCJD cases remains
175.

The overall picture remains consistent with the view that the vCJD
outbreak in the UK is in decline, albeit now with a pronounced tail.
The 1st cases were observed in 1995, and the peak number of deaths was
28 in the year 2000, followed by 20 in 2001, 17 in 2002, 18 in 2003, 9
in 2004, 5 in 2005, 5 in 2006, 5 in 2007, 1 in 2008, 3 in 2009, 3 in
2010, and one so far in 2011.

Totals for all types of CJD cases in the UK in the year 2011
------------------------------------------------------------
During 2011 so far [as of 6 Jun 2011], there have been 64 referrals,
26 fatal cases of sporadic CJD, one case of GSS, 3 cases of familial
CJD, one case of vCJD, and none of iatrogenic CJD.

Since records began in 1990, there have been 27 897 referrals, 1237
fatal cases of sporadic CJD, 171 cases of vCJD, 85 cases of familial
CJD, 65 cases of iatrogenic CJD, and 44 cases of GSS.

Cumulative data 1 Jan to 28 Feb 2011, the 12 months of 2010, and
overall since 1996 [unchanged since previous update]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
During the 1st 2 months of 2011, there have been 52 referrals, 28 of
whom were classified as prion disease cases, comprising 10 cases of
sporadic CJD, 3 of familial CJD, and none of iatrogenic CJD or vCJD.

During the 12 months of 2010, there were 403 referrals, of whom 251
were classified as prion disease cases, comprising 208 cases of
sporadic CJD, 40 of familial CJD, and none of iatrogenic or vCJD.

Overall, 3952 referrals have been examined since screening began in
1996 or thereabouts, with diagnoses pending in 13 cases or
inconclusive in 18 cases, a measure of the difficulty in achieving
unequivocal diagnoses.

During this 16 year period, a total of 2329 prion disease cases have
been screened, a figure which includes 18 (15 during 2010) cases with
type determination pending, but in which a diagnosis of vCJD has been
excluded. Overall, there were 1965 cases of sporadic CJD, 338 cases of
familial CJD, 5 cases of iatrogenic CJD, and 3 cases of vCJD. The 3
cases of vCJD recorded in the USA have been attributed to infection
occurring in the United Kingdom in 2 cases, and in Saudi Arabia in the
other.

opinion on any possible epidemiological or molecular association
between TSEs in animals and humans. EFSA Journal 2011; 9(1): 1945.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
The existing scientific evidence that links animal and human TSEs
[transmissible spongiform encephalopathies] is reviewed and discussed.
The challenges involved in identifying TSEs as zoonoses are described
and the example of the process that led to the establishment of a link
between bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) and variant
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) is reviewed. The strain diversity of
animal and human TSE agents and the factors influencing the capacity
of TSE agents to cross the species transmission barrier are also
discussed. The scientific opinion critically assesses the tools and
methodologies currently available to study and evaluate the possible
association of animal and human TSEs, focussing on epidemiological and
laboratory methods. The available scientific evidence on classical
BSE, typical BSE (H-type and L-type), classical scrapie, atypical
scrapie, chronic wasting disease (CWD), transmissible mink
encephalopathy (TME), and human TSEs is reviewed.

The conclusions state that, at present, the only TSE agent
demonstrated to be zoonotic is the classical BSE agent. Active
screening has allowed the identification of 3 new forms of animal TSEs
(H-type atypical BSE, L-type atypical BSE, and atypical scrapie), but
the information obtained has major limitations due to the unknown
sensitivity of the current monitoring system for these TSEs. There is
no epidemiological evidence to suggest that classical scrapie is
zoonotic. The epidemiological data are too limited to conclude whether
the atypical scrapie agent has a zoonotic potential. Transmission
experiments to human PrP transgenic mice or primates suggest that some
TSE agents other than the classical BSE agent in cattle (namely L-type
atypical BSE, classical BSE in sheep, TME, CWD agents) might have
zoonotic potential and indicate that that of the L-type atypical BSE
agent appears similar or even higher than that of the classical BSE
agent. A single study reported efficient transmission of a natural
sheep classical scrapie isolate to primates.

Commentary
----------
Following to a request from the European Commission, the Panel on
Biological Hazards (BIOHAZ) and the European Centre for Disease
Prevention and Control (ECDC) were asked to deliver a scientific
opinion on any possible epidemiological or molecular association
between transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) in animals
and humans. The opinion reviews and discusses the existing scientific
evidence that links animal and human TSEs currently known.

The opinion first considers the definition of zoonoses and the
principles for the identification of zoonotic diseases, which can be
based on evidence gathered from both epidemiological and laboratory
studies. The opinion describes the challenges involved in identifying
TSEs as zoonoses, due to the specific characteristics of TSE
infections/diseases, such as the nature of TSE agents, the occurrence
of animal and human TSEs, and the type of monitoring applied, the long
incubation period of TSEs etc. The example of the process that led to
establishing a link between bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) and
variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) is reviewed. The
epidemiological and laboratory criteria that can be used to
investigate such a link are described in detail, since those criteria
might be useful for the identification of links between other animal
and human TSEs.

The opinion discusses the strain diversity of the TSE agents
described in sheep, goats, cattle, cervids, and humans, based on the
current knowledge, which highlights that multiple TSE agents exist in
each species. The factors influencing the capacity of TSE agents to
cross the species transmission barrier are then considered in detail,
including the variability in host and donor PrP gene and protein, the
TSE strain type involved and its interaction with the host PrP, and
the route of infection.

The opinion critically assesses the tools and methodologies currently
available to study and evaluate the possible association between
animal and human TSEs. The use of epidemiology is discussed for TSEs
in both animals and humans, and the possibility to compare the 2
sources of information is presented as a possible method to study the
possible links.

Both in vivo and in vitro laboratory methods are considered and
discussed, including neuropathology, transmission experiments
involving different animal models (wild type and transgenic mice,
primates and other species), biochemical methods, cell-free conversion
assays, protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA), and cell
culture assays. Characteristics, advantages, and disadvantages of the
different methods are reviewed, including the opportunity to collate
data from different types of experiments for the study of potential
associations between animal and human TSEs.

The opinion then reviews the scientific evidence currently available
for the different animal and human TSEs, including classical BSE,
atypical BSE (H-type and L-type), classical scrapie, atypical scrapie,
chronic wasting disease (CWD), transmissible mink encephalopathy
(TME), and human TSEs. In particular, the following aspects are
systematically discussed for each TSE agent: epidemiology,
pathogenesis, and in vivo and in vitro transmission experiments.

The opinion concludes that, at present, the only TSE agent
demonstrated to be zoonotic is the classical BSE agent. With regard to
human TSEs, detected cases of sporadic CJD are randomly distributed in
time and geographical location. These observations have been
interpreted as a supportive argument that sporadic CJD is not
environmentally acquired. However, the epidemiological evidence in
relation to sporadic CJD cannot be regarded as definitive, and the
possibility that a small proportion of cases are zoonotic cannot be
excluded.

It also concludes that a series of uncertainties in relation to the
epidemiological patterns of animal and human TSEs indicate that even a
rough comparison of the present epidemiological patterns of human and
animal TSEs other than classical BSE is unlikely to be informative.
Because of these uncertainties, it is an imperative to continue to
carry out systematic surveillance of human TSE diseases, and to
continue and improve the surveillance of animal TSE diseases.

The opinion highlights that the active screening has allowed the
identification of 3 new forms of animal TSEs (L-type atypical BSE,
H-type atypical BSE, and atypical scrapie), but that the information
obtained has major limitations due to the unknown sensitivity of the
current monitoring system for these TSEs.

There is no epidemiological evidence to suggest that classical
scrapie is zoonotic. The epidemiological data are too limited to
conclude whether the atypical scrapie agent has a zoonotic potential.

Transmission experiments to human PrP transgenic mice suggest that
some TSE agents other than the classical BSE agent in cattle (namely
L-type atypical BSE and classical BSE in sheep agents) might have
zoonotic potential, whereas for other agents there is no evidence
provided of a zoonotic potential (H-type atypical BSE and CWD), or no
published studies are available (classical and atypical scrapie). In
addition, transmission experiments to primates suggest that some TSE
agents other than the classical BSE agent in cattle (namely L-type
atypical BSE, classical BSE in sheep, TME, CWD agents) might have
zoonotic potential. In particular, primates are highly permissive to
L-type atypical BSE, even by the oral route.

The opinion emphasizes that laboratory transmission experiments
indicate that the L-type atypical BSE agent has a significant zoonotic
potential, which appears similar or even higher than that of the
classical BSE agent. While transmission data for evaluating the
zoonotic potential of classical scrapie in primates and human PrP
transgenic mice are extremely limited or not yet available, a single
study reported efficient transmission of a natural sheep classical
scrapie isolate to primates.

The opinion concludes that human PrP transgenic mice and primates are
currently the most relevant models for investigating the human
transmission barrier, but the extent to which such models are
informative for measuring the zoonotic potential of an animal TSE
under field exposure conditions is unknown. It is unpredictable
whether a TSE agent will transmit to a new host, and if the
transmission principally occurs, what the transmission rate will be.

Based on the results obtained with in vitro conversion assays, the
opinion concludes that there is probably no absolute molecular barrier
to transmission of TSE agents between mammalian species. Results also
suggest that these assays may be developed as a tool for quantifying
the transmission barriers between species for different TSE agent
strains; however, there is no means at the moment to transpose in
vitro results into the likelihood of in vivo interspecies
transmission.

[ProMED-mail thanks Terry S Singeltary Sr for drawing attention to
this comprehensive document which provides a current evaluation of
experimental work designed to explore the zoonotic potential of the
various recently recognised TSEs of domestic and other animals.

It is concluded that at present the only TSE agent demonstrated to be
zoonotic is the classical BSE agent. Nor can it be entirely excluded
at the present time that a small proportion of cases of sporadic CJD
may be environmentally acquired. - Mod.CP]

A case of BSE in an old cow in the Canton of Bern
-------------------------------------------------
The animal was born in 1995 -- that is still well before the total
ban on feeding meat and bone meal to farm animals in 2001. The current
case confirms that cases of BSE in older cattle must still be expected
occasionally. There are still animals alive from the time before the
total ban on feeding meat and bone meal (MBM) which came into force in
2001. That this case emerges only weeks after another case of BSE in
the canton of St Gallen is pure coincidence. The case in St Gallen was
a so-called atypical BSE case, which can occur sporadically and
spontaneously, and most likely is not due to meat and bone meal feed.
The latest case concerns an old cow in the canton of Bern that had
been infected before the total MBM feed ban in 2001. The cases have
therefore nothing to do with each other.

The latest case shows that the monitoring function measures and the
MBM feed ban for cattle continues to be important. Meat and bone meal
from cattle must not be included in the animal food chain. For the
safety of the people, since 1990 all potentially infectious parts of
cattle, such as brains and spinal cords have been removed as SRM
[specified risk material] from the food chain. This continues to be
operational.
