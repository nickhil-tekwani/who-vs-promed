Azerbaijan: Spread of bird flu untrue
-------------------------------------------
The Minister of Agriculture of Azerbaijan, Ismat Abbasov, said
information about spread of the deadly bird flu virus across the
country is not true. Commenting on results of tests on a 14-year-old
boy from Salyan province suspected of having contracted the H5N1
virus, the Minister said they proved negative.
The boy was hospitalized after he fell sick with a high temperature,
and local doctors feared he might have contracted bird flu. But
analysis carried out by the Ministry of Agriculture's Veterinary
Service and Ministry of Health found no signs of H5N1.
