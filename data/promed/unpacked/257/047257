Unusual Increase in the Number of Persons Infected with Hantavirus in the
Department of Boquerón, Paraguayan Chaco Region
--------------------------------------------------
From 1995 to March 2004, a total of 206 patients in Paraguay were
identified as being infected with hantavirus (with an IgG and IgM positive
serology), of which 93 developed hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) and
113, mild to moderate respiratory symptoms. The general case-fatality rate
for HPS is 20 percent (19/93), one of the lowest in the region. To date, 4
outbreaks have been detected: the first, in 1995 (with 15 cases of HPS);
the second, in 2000 (with 15 HPS cases); the third, in 2001 (with 27 HPS
cases); and the current one. The remaining 34 cases of HPS were isolated
cases occurring during periods between epidemics.
Current Situation
-----------------
From January to 5 May 2004, a total of 11 suspected cases were reported,
of which 5 have been serologically confirmed (IgM, IgG), with one suspected
case pending confirmation. Of the 5 confirmed cases, 2 presented HPS; one,
mild respiratory symptoms with renal syndrome; and the other 2, mild or
moderate respiratory symptoms. All have recovered and have been discharged
from the hospital. The patients' age ranged from 20 to 49 years. A total of
13 contacts have been investigated in the affected areas, of which 5 (38.4
percent) turned out to be positive. All the patients with a confirmed
serological diagnosis live and work in an endemic area (the Central Chaco)
and are engaged in activities entailing risk: agriculture, livestock
production and other tasks related to working in the countryside. Four
patients have indicated the presence of rodents in their home or workplace.
Although the cases have recorded in an endemic area, the recent outbreak
has appeared earlier than usual.
National authorities continue with local surveillance activities in the
area and are intensifying preventive activities through local mass-media
information campaigns. (Reported by the PAHO Communicable Disease Unit from
the PAHO Country Office in Asunción, Paraguay.)

[It would be of interest to know the precise identity of the hantavirus (or
hantaviruses) responsible for these cases in the recent and current
outbreaks of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) in Paraguay. In a paper
published in 1997 (Laguna Negra virus associated with HPS in western
Paraguay and Bolivia. Johnson AM, et al. Virology 1997; 238(1): 115-27)
genetic analysis revealed that a novel hantavirus, designated Laguna Negra
(LN) virus, was associated with a large outbreak of HPS in Paraguay. A
direct genetic link between the virus detected in the HPS cases and in
_Calomys laucha_ rodents, implicated the latter as the primary rodent
reservoir for LN virus in Paraguay. Indeed the virus isolates obtained
from two of these rodents were the first successful isolations of a
pathogenic South American hantavirus. Analysis of the prototype LN virus
entire S and M and partial L segment nucleotide and deduced amino acid
sequences showed that this virus is unique member of the
Sigmodontinae-borne clade of hantaviruses. - Mod.CP]
