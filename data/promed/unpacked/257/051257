At least 10 children who received a Chinese vaccine for the deadly
Japanese encephalitis have died in Uttar Pradesh. Another 102 were
brought in unconscious with high fever and respiratory problems.
A staggering 800 children died [in 2005] because of the deadly
encephalitis, which struck largely in Uttar Pradesh.
Stung by criticism that it had done nothing to prevent the epidemic,
the government this year had imported 135 000 doses of a Chinese
vaccine, over half of which was given to UP alone. However, the
government did not carry out any clinical trials or local studies to
establish how safe the vaccine is. This is a clear breach of its own rules.
"We saw a lot of adverse reactions. Adverse reactions are known but
no deaths were reported. I don't know why so many deaths have
happened. To my mind, it doesn't [seem] to be a safe vaccine," said
Dr A K Rathi, HoD, Medical College, Gorakhpur.
Doctors who treated children with vaccine-related complications a
week after they were immunized in mid-May 2006 say it is far from safe.
"I am not happy the way the vaccination was done. We don't know the
immunity level that was there. After 2005's epidemic, we should have
tested that, otherwise how will we know how effective the vaccine
is?" added Dr Rathi.
Besides UP, 11 deaths were reported in 4 other states where the
vaccine was used.
The centre says the decision to import the Chinese vaccine was taken
only after international authorities led by the World Health
Organization cleared it. But the WHO letter only said the vaccine is
a good one and it does not use the vaccine in its own immunisation
programmes. The health ministry insists the vaccine can't be termed unsafe.
"One death is confirmed. But the others could be coincidental. I'm
not expanding the programme," said P K Hota, Union Health Secretary.
The government didn't want to be caught on the wrong foot and moved
fast to launch the JE campaign. Their intentions may have been right
but the shortcuts have cast a long shadow on the programme.

In 2005, dying children stood outside hospitals in northern India
waiting for an empty bed during one of the worst encephalitis
outbreaks in recent memory. Now, they're lining up again for hours in
the blazing heat to receive a shot that could save their lives.
Since May 2005, nearly 11 million children aged 1 to 15 years have
been vaccinated against the mosquito-borne Japanese encephalitis in
high-risk areas of 4 northern states, US-based nonprofit group Path
said on Tuesday [25 Jul 2006].
It was the first-ever mass immunisation campaign to fight the
brain-damaging virus, and many skeptics doubted it would ever happen
this fast. But the 2005 outbreak, which killed about 1800 children
and left many survivors permanently disabled with physical and
neurological damage, sparked a wave of quick action rarely seen
within India's bureaucracy-clogged government.
Critical news reports and images of unconscious children lying 2 to a
bed led to a public outcry, and India's top health officials promised
to take action before the next rainy season, said Dr Julie Jacobson,
director of Path's Japanese Encephalitis Project.
"They latched onto the idea of vaccine being the answer," said
Jacobson, who pushed for 6 years for the vaccination campaign. "All
the rest of the stuff doesn't work. They've been (having outbreaks)
for 30 years, and it keeps happening."
Most victims live in the poorest corners of India, typically
surrounded by rice paddies in farming villages. The mosquitoes
transmit the virus from pigs and birds to humans. Since most infected
people never develop symptoms, many adults are immune from earlier
exposure, leaving young children most vulnerable.
Japanese encephalitis is closely related to West Nile virus, but
found only in Asia. It attacks the central nervous system, damaging
the brain and spinal cord. High fevers are often followed by seizures
and comas, and many children need ventilators to breathe.
An estimated 50 000 cases -- more than 10 000 of [which are] fatal --
occur annually, the World Health Organisation says. Up to 1/3 of
survivors suffer problems ranging from paralysis to mental disabilities.
India's vaccination campaign was based on a partnership with China.
The Chinese have virtually wiped out the disease after making their
own vaccine and distributing it widely since 1988. It is made from a
weakened form of the virus and given in one shot that protects for a lifetime.
India produces limited amounts of another vaccine, used widely in
Western countries. It is more expensive, harder to manufacture and
requires multiple injections. Even at full capacity, the sole Indian
manufacturer could only reach a fraction of children in need.
China agreed to make some 13 million doses for India at a discounted
price -- about 180 million rupees (USD 3.8 million), said Dr S.
Sarkar, an adviser on immunisation for WHO and the Indian government.
That's about 13.80 rupees (29 cents) per child.
Sarkar ran the country's immunisation program for 18 years and saw
the virus return each year after the monsoon rains left ideal
breeding grounds for mosquitoes. He was amazed by the huge crowds of
children that showed up for the free shots, which will later be given
to other affected areas and eventually added into routine vaccinations.
"Without any fear in their eyes, they were coming out of the centres
laughing. They didn't cry when they were standing and getting their
shots," Sarkar said. "I think we have achieved something."
But some doctors fear the campaign, covering 11 districts in the
states of Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Assam and Karnataka, will not
be enough to prevent a high death toll among children in 2006.
Health officials in Assam last week reported 25 Japanese encephalitis
deaths and dozens of other suspected cases. In Uttar Pradesh state, 4
children have already tested positive for the virus and another 48
have been hospitalised with symptoms, said Dr A.K. Rathi, pediatrics
chief at BRD Medical College hospital in Gorakhpur, where the bulk of
2005's cases died.
About 200 000 unprotected children remain scattered across hundreds
of villages, said Dr K.P. Kushwaha, a senior paediatrician at the hospital.
"The JE patients have started trickling in," he said. "It is a matter
of time when they will start pouring."

[As can be seen by a review of prior ProMED-mail postings (see
below), India has had annual problems with Japanese encephalitis (JE)
outbreaks. The above newswires present complementary information on
the 1st mass JE vaccination campaign being held in India. In the 1st
report there is a discussion on possible serious reactions following
receipt of the vaccine being used in the campaign, mentioning at
least one death and close to 200 addition serious neurologic
reactions. In the 2nd report, there is mention that more than 11
million children have been vaccinated with the JE vaccine since May
(approximately 2.5 months), with mention that JE activity has begun
in the endemic regions. One can't help but wonder if the alleged
vaccine reactions - cited in part [1] - may in fact have been
children already infected with the JE virus and were vaccinated
during the incubation period.
From the WHO's website:
"Current JE vaccines licensed for use include an inactivated mouse
brain-derived vaccine, a vero cell-derived inactivated vaccine, and a
live attenuated SA14-14-2 vaccine produced in primary hamster kidney
cells. Currently, there is no JE vaccine which is WHO-prequalified.
Only the Nakayama strain inactivated mouse brain-derived vaccine is
internationally registered, while there are several vaccines produced
in a number of countries and used locally."
<http://www.who.int/vaccine_safety/topics/japanese_encephalitis/en/>
According to the PATH (Program for Applied Technology in Health)
website, the vaccine being used is the live attenuated SA 14-14-2
vaccine produced in China. "More than 200 million doses have been
given without any recorded severe side effects."
<http://www.path.org/vaccineresources/japanese_encephalitis-vaccine.php>.
Data were presented at the US National Instituties of Health --
Safety And Efficacy Of Live Attenuated Japanese Encephalitis Vaccine
SA14-14-2 In Human Vaccination by Yu Yongxin
(<http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/news/events/meetings/Viral+Infections/Yongxin.pdf>)
"Human clinical trials carried out in China, Korea and Nepal have
demonstrated 85-100 percent seroconversion rates in JE non-immune
subjects and 96-99 percent protective efficacy in JE-endemic areas
after one single vaccination. Persistence of neutralizing antibody
has shown to be 88.8 percent in vaccinated subjects after 6 years in
a JE non-endemic area after 2 doses of vaccination. The duration of
protective efficacy has been demonstrated at least 12 years in one
area and 5 years in another area following an immunization schedule
of one primary dose at one age and one booster dose at 2 ages. Data
collected from several provinces have shown evident decline of JE
morbidity in regions where vaccination campaigns with SA14-14-2 live
vaccine had been carried out compared with the local historical data
and with neighboring counties where no vaccination was conducted
during the same periods."
In a June 2005, the WHO Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety
(GACVS) reviewed the safety issues related to the JE SA 14-14-2
vaccine:
(<http://www.who.int/vaccine_safety/topics/japanese_encephalitis/live_attenuated/June_2005/en/index.html>,
"Of 522 vaccinated children actively monitored for adverse events for
4 weeks after vaccination, approximately 10 percent developed fever
higher than 38 C and a cough. Redness and swelling at the site of
injection were observed in less than 1 percent. These findings are
consistent with those reported from China." and concluded: "GACVS
acknowledged the excellent safety and efficacy profile of the SA
14-14-2 vaccine but nonetheless recommended more detailed study of
the following: the safety profile in special risk groups including
immunocompromised people and pregnant women; whether viral shedding
occurs in vaccinees and the potential implications of such shedding;
further analysis of sequential or co-administration of JE and measles
vaccines; the interchangeability of inactivated and live JE vaccines;
the safety of vaccine administration to infants aged under 1 year;
and the implications for the efficacy and safety of the vaccine in
infants with maternal antibodies against JE virus." Thus, this
review suggested there were still significant vaccine safety issues
to be studied.
ProMED-mail would appreciate receiving more information from
knowledgeable sources in India on the JE vaccination campaign and
possible serious side effects associated with the use of this
vaccine. More information on studies performed on the alleged serious
side effects related to the vaccine (such as laboratory testing for
evidence of JE infection) would also be appreciated. - Mod.MPP]
