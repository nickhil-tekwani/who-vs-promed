Seven people have died of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF), known as Congo fever, in a village in central Mali, the communications officer for the governorate of Mopti announced on Wednesday [5 Feb 2020].

The viral disease is spread by infected ticks. The disease was "detected at the end of January [2020] in a shepherd in the village of Samoa", in the Kera health district, he added. The man, infected through contact with an ox, "was treated" on the spot. But on 1 Feb 2020, "there were 14 cases detected and 5 people died" in the same village, said the spokesman.

Two other residents of the same village died after being transported to health centers in Sevare (center), according to the same source. "It is different from the coronavirus," said the spokesman.

Transmission to humans of CCHF occurs "either through tick bites or through contact with the blood or tissue of infected animals, during or immediately after slaughter", according to the World Health Organization (WHO).

Human-to-human transmission of the disease "may occur as a result of direct contact with blood, secretions, organs or body fluids of infected people," the organization said. The hemorrhagic fever virus causes death in 10% to 40% of cases. The disease is present in Africa, Asia, the Middle East and Eastern Europe.

News is emerging that a viral infection that was last seen about 10 years ago has now emerged in the country of Mali as of 1 Feb 2020. So far, 7 people have been confirmed dead and about 20 confirmed infected, with many more suspected of being infected as a result of the virus outbreak.

CCHF or Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever is a viral disease. Symptoms of CCHF may include fever, muscle pains, headache, vomiting, diarrhea, and bleeding into the skin. Onset of symptoms is less than 2 weeks following exposure. The virus can also spread between people via body fluids.

The CCHF virus, unlike the coronavirus, is typically spread by tick bites or contact with livestock carrying the disease. Those affected are often farmers or working slaughterhouses. The virus can also spread between people via body fluids. Diagnosis is by detecting antibodies, the virus's RNA, or the virus itself. It is a type of viral hemorrhagic fever.

To date, a vaccine is not commercially available. Treatment is typically with supportive care. The medication ribavirin may also help.

A spokesperson for the regional government of the central Mopti region in Mali, Mr. Yacouba Maiga, said, "Seven people have died in an outbreak of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, also known as Congo fever, in a village in central Mali. A shepherd "contracted the illness from an ox" in the village of Samoa in late January [2020]. He was treated, but the disease surfaced again on 1 Feb 2020 infecting 20 people and killing 5."

Two other patients died while being transported to the town of Sevare, in central Mali, for treatment, while many more had come into contact with those infected.

Health minister Michel Sidibe told Thailand Medical News via a telephone interview, "It's a rare occurrence in Mali. There have been cases around 10 years ago. Health officials were preparing for an investigative mission in the area with the support of security forces. We are concerned that the infection can spread, as there are no medical and health services in that area."

An official in Mopti said on Thursday [6 Feb 2020] to date no one has come to the region yet to help or assess the situation. The Mopti region in Mali is hit by regular jihadist attacks, as a conflict between the militant and government and foreign forces is raging in the area.

As a result of the violence there, there is no medical or health facilities, plus it is difficult for the villagers to get access to outside help. An official from Mopti said that the lack of access to medical or health facilities or even difficult access by state officials will act as a catalyst for the virus to spread and end up becoming another epidemic.

[Numerous viral hemorrhagic fevers are endemic to countries in Africa. Despite the underlying pathogens originating from diverse virus families, clinical features of hemorrhagic fevers are similar, including fever, malaise, abdominal pain, vomiting, headache, and myalgia (https://www.who.int/topics/haemorrhagic_fevers_viral/en/). These nonspecific symptoms and their similarity to other infectious diseases common in West Africa, such as malaria, complicate the differential diagnosis.

In regions where surveillance data are limited and healthcare workers are less aware of viral hemorrhagic diseases, the possibility for misdiagnosis is high.

The CCHF virus (CCHFV) was first reported in ticks in Mali in 2014 by Zivcec et al. (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/20/5/13-1641_article) and later by other groups as well (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28719259).

CCHFV was not previously known to circulate in the human population of Mali until Baumann and colleagues reported detection of acute CCHFV infection in 2 young patients hospitalized at Hospital Gabriel Toure in April 2017 using reverse-transcription quantitative PCR. Sequence data from the viral S segment and phylogenetic analysis showed one of the 2 viruses to be related to CCHFV strain ArD39554 from Mauritania and CCHFV sequence (GenBank accession no. KF793333) recently detected in ticks collected only 25 km (15.5 mi) away from Bamako region (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/25/5/18-1047_article#r1).

The above report underlines the need for CCHFV and other hemorrhagic fever surveillance programs in sub-Saharan regions of Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger, which have similar ecology. - Mod.UBA
