Two Indonesians have died of bird flu, apparently after contact with
sick chickens, raising the country's death toll to 115, the Health
Ministry said Wednesday [21 Jan 2009].

A Ministry statement said a 6-year-old girl in Bekasi, West Java died
on 2 Jan 2009. She got sick after buying a chicken with her parents
at a market and was hospitalized for a week. A 29-year-old woman died
on 16 Dec 2008 in Tangerang just outside the capital, Jakarta. She
developed flu-like symptoms after visiting a market and died in a
hospital 5 days later. Double laboratory testing confirmed they had
the H5N1 strain of avian influenza, the statement said.

Indonesia has regularly recorded human deaths from bird flu since the
virus began ravaging poultry stocks across Asia in 2003. It 1st
reported deaths from the disease in 2005. The World Health
Organization (WHO), which bases its tally on national figures, put
Indonesia's death toll from the virus at 113 out of 249 recorded
fatalities worldwide, including 3 Chinese victims this year [2009;
see ProMED-mail report "Avian influenza, human (12): China (GZ)," (to
be archived)].

In Beijing, the Health Ministry said Wednesday [21 Jan 2009] that a
large scale outbreak of bird flu was unlikely in China even though
the country has reported 4 cases this month [January 2009]. The
deaths were scattered across different provinces, were isolated,
unrelated, and did not show significant mutations of the H5N1 virus,
the ministry said. "There's no evidence of a possibility of a large
scale outbreak," the ministry said in a faxed statement to the
Associated Press.

Bird flu remains hard for people to catch, but health experts worry
it could mutate into a form that passes easily between humans,
possibly triggering a pandemic that could kill millions worldwide.
Indonesia is considered a potential hotspot for such a mutation; the
country's health minister has refused to share virus samples with the
WHO for more than 2 years. She argues that pharmaceutical companies
will use the samples to make vaccines that are ultimately
unaffordable to her own people. Critics say Indonesia's policy is
making it harder to see whether the virus is morphing into a more
dangerous form.

[These 2 deaths bring Indonesia's avian influenza death toll to 115.
In addition, a 43-year-old woman who died in hospital in Tangerang on
17 Jan 2009 was considered to be a suspected case of avian influenza
(see ProMED-mail reference below), but this has not been confirmed so
far. (It is possible, however, that there has been confusion over
identity, and the 2 patients in hospital in Tangerang may be one and
the same person).

Jakarta, the Indonesian capital, can be found by accessing the
