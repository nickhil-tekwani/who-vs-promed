Britain Probes Cluster of "Mad Cow" Cases
--------------------------------------------
LONDON (Reuters) : Britain said on Friday it had launched an urgent inquiry
into why a handful of people linked to one small village had all died from
"Mad Cow" disease, calling the outbreak more than a statistical blip. It
began the investigation last month after learning that four deaths from new
variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD), the human form of the [bovine
brain-wasting disease, and one other probable case were all connected to
the same village in a rural part of Leicestershire in the Midlands of
England. Three of the victims died within weeks of each other; all lived
within a close radius. "It's unlikely that this is a coincidence. But
clusters are notoriously difficult to identify and substantiate, which is
why we're having the investigation", said Health Department spokeswoman
Alison Langley.
Langley said the investigation would probably take months to conduct but it
could add a vital new piece to the Mad Cow disease/new variant CJD jigsaw.
The ministry said there was no cause for alarm. The victims would have been
exposed to the infective agent "many years ago". Most victims were believed
to have contracted the fatal disease in the late 1980s through eating
infected meat. Mad Cow is a fatal brain-wasting disease which scientists
believe spreads to people via infected beef. Symptoms include blurred
vision, slurred speech and a loss of limb control. There is no known cure,
with most victims dying in a period of months. Although the cluster around
the village of Queniborough seems small, Britain has logged 75 new variant
CJD deaths nationwide since the beginning of the epidemic. One victim,
24-year-old woman, died in 1998 two years after the first symptoms
appeared. She had been a frequent visitor to the village, where her
grandmother lived.
"Occasionally we did used to buy meat from the village", said her mother
who was born in Queniborough. "You could buy half of an animal, a cow or a
sheep or whatever, and that's what we used to do on occasion. It's always
in my mind whether anyone else might get it in your family", she told BBC
radio.
Although politicians say the problem is largely under control now that
tougher agricultural controls are in place, scientists say the final
epidemic could eventually affect hundreds or hundreds of thousands of
people. "We don't know what tragedies there might be in the pipeline. I
accept that the prospects of an outbreak, on the scale that some feared,
seem to be receding but nevertheless we've got to learn lessons from this",
said local member of parliament David Taylor.
France and Ireland have also reported deaths from Mad Cow disease. Britain
is so far the European country worst hit by a problem that started after
farmers began feeding processed offal to their herds. Portugal too has
reported a possible death, while Denmark, which prides itself on high farm
standards, identified an infected milk cow earlier this year.

[The eventual magnitude of the epidemic of new variant CJD in the United
Kingdom is still indeterminate, with current estimates ranging from
hundreds to hundreds of thousands The long incubation of prion-related
diseases requires a cautious approach to forecasting. This cluster of cases
in Leicestershire appears to be more significant than a previously
investigated "cluster" that did not withstand close scrutiny. Intensive
study of the Queniborough cluster may provide clues to the relative
importance of genetic background, environment and nutritional factors in
susceptibility to new variant CJD. Recently, methods have developed that
can detect the BSE prion in tonsil tissue. A large scale retrospective
screening of stored tonsil tissue failed to find evidence of the BSE agent.
Although a negative result, it encouraged hopes that the incidence of BSE
in the population might not be high. The detection of this cluster of
cases, though small and as yet circumstantial, has dispelled to some extent
this optimism. - Mod. CP
