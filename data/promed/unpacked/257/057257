[All 8 follow-up reports of this continuing event, which started 5 Sep 2018, commendably include an epidemiological comment with information on the causative agent's profile, found to be foot and mouth disease (FMD) serotype O, topotype ME-SA, lineage Panasia-2. Its summary, as of 13 Feb 2019, is the following:

Total outbreaks: 21 (submitted)
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Cattle / 3060 / 507 / 0 / 0 / 0
Mountain gazelle / Not available / 2 / 2 / 0 / 0
Wild boar / Not available / 2 / 2 / 0 / 0

The affected animals were free-range and fattening beef cattle, as well as wild gazelles and wild boar. No dairy cattle were affected. The identified virus lineage was found to be slightly different from the sub-strain behind the earlier April to July 2018 event. It is assumed that the origin of the 1st event was in Jordan, whereas the 2nd event originated, most probably, from Lebanon or Syria.

Several of the recorded cases, including the current one in Yonatan (Golan) and the previous one in Gonen (adjacent Upper Galilee; follow-up report 7), involved vaccinated animals, leading to a concern that the vaccine applied in the annual vaccinations and revaccinations did not confer full protection, particularly in young animals.

Following recent analyses, the Israeli veterinary services (VSAH) contemplate the use, in the near future, of vaccine strain "O Turkey 5/09," which seems closer to the current field strains than the ones included in the 2018 vaccine (see commentary in 20181229.6227576). The composition of the multivalent vaccine and the vaccination policy are about to be reviewed, taking into consideration the accumulated experience, the regional FMD situation, and the high susceptibility of the national dairy herd signified by extremely high milk records. - Mod.AS
