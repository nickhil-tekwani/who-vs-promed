I am replying to your posting on pertussis in Russia. I worked in 11
countries of the former Soviet Union, including Russia, starting from 1992
until 1999 to provide technical support for vaccination programs. This
work was funded by USAID and carried out by the REACH and BASICS projects.

It will come as a surprise to most of your readers that most of the
countries of the former Soviet Union do not collect data on coverage with
"DPT". It is true that when reporting to international agencies, they
report their coverage invariably as DPT. However, these countries
internally reported, and most still report, coverage separately by each
specific antigen: that is, coverage with D, P, and T.

In the case of Russia, the difference between reported coverage with D and
coverage with P was significant, as much as 15 absolute percentage points
in the late 1980s and early 1990s. This disparity reflected the concerns
typically heard from pediatricians that the DPT vaccine was "too strong"
and the children had become "too weak" to be able to tolerate the pertussis
component of DPT. Consequently, many providers opted to use DT (and even Td
!!) for pediatric immunization. Practitioners in the USA need to make
careful evaluation of adopted children's vaccination records to determine
whether or not they indeed received the pertussis component.

The countries of the former Soviet Union also never reported coverage on
children under 12 months of age, which is the international standard. While
the countries of the former Soviet Union had an excellent system of
tracking individual children in need of vaccination by pediatric catchment
areas, they did not adopt this global standard of monitoring and reporting
vaccination coverage by 12 months of age. Instead the numerator to
calculate coverage typically included children irrespective of age of
vaccination and the denominator excluded the sizeable number of children
with permanent or temporary contraindications to vaccination. Consequently,
timely vaccination coverage was (and is) considerably less well reported in
many of these countries. In fact, as part of their applications for funding
from GAVI (the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization), several of
the former Soviet countries conducted population-based 30-cluster
vaccination coverage surveys. These surveys have all shown coverage by 12
months of age to be about 20 percent (or more in some cases) lower than the
reported figures.

Each of these surveys also shows that the mean age of DPT vaccination is
quite delayed, most likely due to the frequency of temporary contraindications.

Much of our work in collaboration with WHO was devoted to exposing these
new countries to recent developments in western science to guide policy
reformulation, to encourage them to streamline their immunization
schedules, to reduce their excessive lists of contraindications, and to
establish active monitoring systems (in Kyrgyzstan and Ukraine) so that
health workers at all levels could indeed start to track their cumulative
monthly DPT coverage in infants. In most of the other countries of the
former Soviet Union, coverage is still monitored in the former Soviet
fashion as described above.

[Thank you very much for this clarification Robert. As someone who had
worked fairly extensively in vaccination program activities internationally
(but never in the Russian Federation), I still was unaware that the
pertussis component had been optionally removed as part of routine
vaccination activities in that region. Hence, it is possible that many of
the children coming from the Russian Federation are behind in the pertussis
vaccine component and that a careful review of the vaccination histories
might identify this. The additional information that many children's
vaccinations are delayed for "temporary reasons" may also explain the lower
coverages. Adjusting the reported coverage of 97 percent for the
information from the coverage surveys would have the DPT coverages by age
12 months to be approximately 77 percent overall, and indicative of the
need to improve vaccination activities, as well as highlighting the need to
carefully screen vaccination histories of children coming from the Russian
Federation. - Mod.MPP]

Although the immunization records of internationally adopted children are
carefully reviewed by the US Embassy and INS officials, the children are
often routinely completely re-vaccinated when they visit their primary care
physician in the US. The same goes for pre-adoption screening for HIV,
Hepatitis B, and TB. CF: Aronson, Jane, "Medical Evaluation and
Infectious Considerations on Arrival" in "Medical Issues in International
Adoptions," Pediatric Annals 29:4/April 2000

Apparently, the prevailing belief is that the records may be inaccurate and
the original records cannot be read by officials in US public schools (and
copies may not be considered official). It is simpler and safer to
revaccinate, even though it is rather traumatic for the already
culture-shocked little new arrivals.

[Taking into consideration the information given by Robert Steinglass
above, it does not appear to be unwise to consider revaccination as
mentioned here. - Mod.MPP]

I write regarding the vaccination of adoptive children and the review of
immunization records prior to traveling to the adopted (or to be adopted)
child's country of origin. While every attempt is made to understand the
adoptive child's health and needs before traveling, certain cultural
differences, as well as governmental procedures, preclude obtaining all
information one would like to have. The INS does require adoptive parents
to obtain all immunizations, or start obtaining them, within the first 30
days after returning to the United States.

The American Medical Association also recommends that, in most cases, all
internationally adopted children repeat their immunization series once in
the US. (This was recently reported in the MMWR)

The moderator posed the question about "whether vaccination histories
of adoptive children should be reviewed prior to travel to their adoptive
country."

They are! As a US parent of a child adopted from a Russian orphanage, I
can attest to the mountains of paperwork required and reviewed. The
immunization history is reviewed by a physician during the medical exam
required to obtain a visa. Additionally, in order to obtain a visa, parents
of young children must sign an affidavit that they will update and complete
vaccinations upon return to the US. No measure will be 100 percent
effective, but the mechanism for review of vaccine history is in place.

[Clearly there are regulations in place that would ensure that adopted
children are appropriately vaccinated for age prior to obtaining a visa for
entry to the USA. But, as pointed out, no measure is 100 percent. The
reference kindly provided by Dr. Sharon Ludwick demonstrates that the
pediatric community has recognized the special circumstances related to
international adoptions. Having gotten the predicted barrage of emails in
response to my comments, I think it's now time to cut this thread. - Mod.MPP]
