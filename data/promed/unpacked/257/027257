The number of infections caused by highly antibiotic-resistant extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing _Escherichia coli_ (_E. coli_) bacteria is increasing in community hospitals, a setting in which most Americans receive care, according to a new study published online Tuesday [13 Oct 2015] in Infection Control & Hospital Epidemiology, the journal of the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America [SHEA] [1].

"The lack of active screening for ESBL-producing bacteria in the majority of American hospitals means that infection prevention measures, such as contact isolation and patient cohorting, are not applied to patients who do not have symptoms, but who may be colonized with the bacteria," said Joshua Thaden, MD, PhD, a lead author of the study and fellow in the division of Infectious Diseases at Duke University Medical Center. "These 'silently' colonized patients increase the risk of transmission to vulnerable patients via healthcare workers or environmental contamination, compromising safety and quality of care."

Examining health records at 26 community hospitals in the southeastern U.S. between 2009 and 2014, researchers found that the incidence of ESBL-[producing] _E. coli_ increased from 5.28 to 10.5 infections per 100 000 patients during that period. The number of hospitals reporting these infections also increased from 17 to 20.

"The fact that most healthcare-associated bacterial transmission events go unnoticed also means that the actual rate of bacterial acquisition may be much higher than our data suggest," said Thaden.

Researchers found that the incidence of these particular infection strains continues to grow and surpass the presence of other bacteria, such as ESBL-producing _Klebsiella pneumoniae_. While the infection rate of ESBL-[producing] _E. coli_ increased at community hospitals and health care facilities, the rate of hospital-onset infections has remained virtually unchanged.

Overall, the majority of infections caused by ESBL-[producing] _E. coli_ occurred after exposure to the healthcare system, with nearly 3/4ths of the infections either hospital-onset or healthcare-associated, making these settings focal points of transmissions. However, the study also shows a concerning rise in community-associated infections in individuals with less exposure to the healthcare system.

The retrospective study used surveillance data from the Duke Infection Control Outreach Network (DICON) and followed an earlier study of 16 hospitals that had demonstrated the emergence and rise of ESBL-[producing] _E. coli_ infections.

[The results of this study are consistent with those of other studies that show an increasing incidence of community-acquired infection due to extended-spectrum beta-lactamase [ESBL]-producing _Escherichia coli_ in multiple countries in the past decade. Urinary tract infection (UTI) is the most common infection caused by ESBL-producing _E. coli_, but these organisms are also seen in other types of infections, such as intra-abdominal infections (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2897323/).

There are multiple types of ESBLs, such as TEM, SHV, CTX-M, and OXA, each with multiple subtypes (http://cmr.asm.org/content/18/4/657.full). Community-acquired ESBL-producing _E. coli_ have frequently been CTX-M-type ESBLs (http://www.jwatch.org/id201303130000003/2013/03/13/community-acquisition-esbl-producing-e-coli, http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/13/7/07-0094_article). ESBL-producing _E. coli_ are resistant to most beta-lactam antibiotics except carbapenems. The genes encoding ESBLs are located mainly on transferable plasmids -- often in association with other antibiotic-resistance genes, including genes that encode resistance to fluoroquinolones (e.g., ciprofloxacin), aminoglycosides (e.g., gentamicin), and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. ESBL-producing _E. coli_ that cause urinary tract infection have usually remained susceptible to nitrofurantoin and fosfomycin (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21706226).

Because of increasing antibiotic resistance rates of _E. coli_ to current standard empiric antibiotic regimens, guidelines for the management of community-acquired infections will require revisions. For example, fosfomycin or nitrofurantoin are now recommended for the 1st-line empirical oral treatment of community-acquired uncomplicated UTIs (http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/52/5/e103.full). Selecting an appropriate antibiotic regimen to prevent or empirically treat infections after transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy has also become problematic because of the high prevalence of rectal carriage of antibiotic-resistant strains of _E. coli_ (http://jcm.asm.org/content/50/12/4157.full). - Mod.ML]
