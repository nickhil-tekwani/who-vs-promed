A 2nd case of measles has been confirmed in Michigan for 2018, and if you traveled lately, you may have been exposed.

The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) said this case is unrelated to Michigan's 1st, which occurred in March 2018. Both are the result of exposure outside of the country and may have exposed other travelers.

The ill individual arrived on 12 Jun 2018 at around 3:45 p.m. at Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport (DTW) at the international arrivals area of the McNamara Terminal. That person was considered contagious at the time, and health officials are working to contact potentially exposed passengers from the flight.

In addition to the possibility of exposing people at the airport, the ill individual was also at locations listed in the URL above.

This year [2018], several countries in Europe are reporting significant measles outbreaks, including France, Italy, Germany, England, Romania, and Ukraine, among others. Recent outbreaks have also been reported in Venezuela, Colombia, and Brazil.

Measles is being reported in the Dr. Elías Toro Hospital in Caracas. Since the recurrence of the disease in 2017 until mid-June of this year [2018], pediatric center specialists have confirmed 465 cases in total.

The records were released by the infectious disease specialist Dr. Francisco Valery in the framework of the XIII Congress of Infectology, celebrated this Wed 20 Jun 2018. The specialist pointed out that the death of a child was recorded by the viral infection, and that of the total confirmed cases, 37% had to be hospitalized in the Elías Toro [hospital] after presenting respiratory complications.

Of 465 cases, 170 were hospitalized, and 295 were treated on an outpatient basis," The Galen explained. 144 patients in the hospitalized group had pneumonia, the most common complication of measles in children and the leading cause of death.

Valery added that cases of 9 adolescents with measles were also recorded.

"When vaccination coverage drops, cases of such diseases begin to appear," Valery explained.

Measles, a vaccine-preventable disease, reappeared in Venezuela 15 years after its eradication. In mid-September 2017, the Venezuelan Alliance for Health issued an alert after the confirmation of 8 cases of viral infection in Bolivar state between 22 Aug and 11 Sep 2017.

Since then, measles has expanded to various states in the country. According to the latest epidemiological bulletin published by the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) dated 8 Jun 2018, Venezuela confirmed 1427 cases of viral disease, a figure with which it duplicates the number of cases reported throughout the year 2017, with 727 records.

The regional agency also revealed that 35 measles deaths were recorded at the national level, 33 of them in the Delta Amacuro state, where there is low vaccination coverage.

"The outbreak continues with active transmission in 17 states, and the Capital district reported confirmed cases. Since the confirmation of the 1st case of measles in SE 26 of 2017 and until SE 19 of 2018, 2154 cases of measles were confirmed," the alert indicates.

The bulletin indicates that the largest number of suspected cases of measles were reported in Bolivar state, followed by the capital district.

From the original source of infection, the village of Drahnov, the infected, who violated quarantine rules, have spread measles to other places. Six cases also involve medical staffers.

The number of patients sick with measles is still growing in the eastern Slovak area of lower Zemplin. By 14 Jun 2018, there were 38 cases of measles registered in the Michalovce and Sobrance districts, of which 17 are confirmed by laboratories, spokesperson of the Slovak Public Healthcare Office (ÚVZ) Dasa Rackova told the TASR newswire.

In Drahnov, there are 29 incidences, while in the villages of Falkusovce, Maovske Vojkovce, Trhoviste, Vysoka nad Uhom, Lozin and in the towns of Strazske and Michalovce, there is one case each, as well in the villages of Baskovce in the Sobrance District, and in the city of Kosice.

"A total of 33 patients were hospitalised, all with clinical symptoms but without serious complications," Rackova said, as quoted by TASR.

Of all the cases, 3 are imported, and 6 involve the medical staff of the Michalovce hospital. "All incidences have an epidemiological connection," Rackova added.

Most cases are registered with people aged 15-19 (13 cases), and the same number of patients are between 20 and 54 years of age. Twelve children between one and 14 years of age have been recorded as sick with the disease.

"The increase in measles' cases in eastern Slovakia, despite the ordered anti-epidemic measures, can be ascribed also to those sick coming from poor hygienic living conditions in the Michalovce District," Rackova explained, adding that patients from this community are not responsible enough to continue anti-epidemic measures. She also mentioned previous epidemics earlier recorded in these population groups in eastern Slovakia, the Sme daily wrote.

By the morning of 19 Jun 2018, 6 patients were hospitalised in the infectious diseases' ward of Michalovce hospital under suspicion of measles.

"So far, no serious complication in the course of the sickness has been recorded in patients," Jana Fedakova, of the Svet Zdravia company that operates the hospital, told Sme. She added that since the beginning of June 2018, 3 cases of measles have been confirmed in nurses working in the infectious diseases' ward. "All of them have recuperated from the sickness and returned to work," she mentioned, as cited by the daily. Two other nurses (one from radiology and the other from the paediatric ward) and a doctor of the infectious diseases' ward are awaiting the results of laboratory tests.

Fedakova pointed out that in the Michalovce hospital, strict measures are in effect to protect patients, as well as employees. So far, more than 600 medical staffers of the hospital have been vaccinated against measles, she told Sme.

They must receive mandatory vaccination, the Pravda daily wrote, or else take compulsory days off.

------------------------------------------------
[Study] Conclusion: we estimated a persistent high resurgence risk for mumps and measles and a relatively lower risk for rubella. This risk varies by department and sex. In addition to young infants, primarily teenagers and young adults would be affected by these outbreaks. As part of the efforts to improve vaccination coverage, the public perception of measles, mumps and rubella as generally harmless diseases should be addressed to prevent future outbreaks of these vaccine-preventable diseases.

There have been more than 20 cases of measles reported in Croydon since the start of the year [2018], a huge increase compared to last year.

Young people heading off on holiday to Europe, where there are large outbreaks of measles, are being encouraged to check whether they have had both MMR doses, as many missed out when vaccination rates dropped in the early 2000s due to unfounded fears over the vaccine.

From the start of the year 2018 up to 17 Jun 2018, 23 suspected cases of measles were reported to Public Health England (PHE) in Croydon. Cases across England and Wales have now exceeded 1500 in 2018.

The number of reports is 23 times higher than the one case reported in the same 24 weeks in 2017.

[7] England warning

Health officials in England continue to report additional measles cases in the country this year [2018]. Between 1 Jan 2018 and 18 Jun 2018, there have been 643 laboratory confirmed measles cases in England.

Cases were reported in most areas, with London (225), the South-East (137), West Midlands (82), South-West (79), and Yorkshire and Humberside (74) reporting the most cases.

Cases of measles also continue to rise across England in unvaccinated young adults.

This and the measles outbreak in Europe has prompted them to encourage young adults to make sure they have had both doses of the MMR vaccine before going on holiday to Europe, where there are large outbreaks of measles.

While vaccine uptake levels in the UK in young children are currently very high, coverage levels dipped to a low of 80% in 2003. This means that there are significant numbers of unprotected teenagers and young adults who could catch measles both in Europe and in England, particularly in environments of close mixing such as summer festivals and when they travel abroad for the summer holidays.

The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that to prevent outbreaks of disease, 95% of people need to have received the MMR vaccine.

The vaccine is available free to anyone who has not received both doses as a child. It protects against measles, mumps and rubella, all of which can be very serious diseases and are highly infectious.

Health authorities are urging anyone with measles symptoms to phone but not visit their family doctor. That comes as authorities warn that the latest measles outbreak now affects the entire South Island.

Two adults and a 13-month-old baby who were at Queenstown Airport on 22 Mar 2018 were [infected].

Canterbury Medical Officer of Health Ramon Pink said they were recovering well, but 2 new cases had now also been confirmed among men in their late 30s or early 40s in Nelson and Christchurch.

He said those people flew on flights around the South Island.

It's not known who the source was, but Dr Pink said they had identified the strain involved.

"What we do know is that Queenstown is an international airport, and we know that the strain of this particular measles virus has been also identified circulating in Australia. And so it's highly possible that someone who was unaware that they were infectious travelled to New Zealand, and because it is highly infectious, they could have infected people even just walking through and gathering for a period of time in an airport."

None of the 1st 3 was immunised with the MMR [measles, mumps and rubella] vaccine. Of the 2 latest cases, the one in Christchurch believed he was immunised but was unsure, and the Nelson man was partially immunised, with just one of the required 2 jabs. ...

Dr Pink said technology now enabled the strain of the measles to be identified relatively quickly.

Public health authorities were aware, therefore, that the strain involved in the 1st 3 confirmed cases was also identified in late March-early April 2018 in Australia.

"I understand this particular strain may have been introduced into Australia by a traveller from southeast Asia. It's not a new strain; it's a strain that we have seen before, but we certainly haven't seen it for some time." ...

There were more than 21 000 cases of measles in Europe last year [2017], including 35 deaths, according to information published by the World Health Organization.

Good health services in New Zealand limited the spread of such communicable diseases, which made it easy for people to become complacent about the potential impacts, he said.

"It can impact on our health services, and, therefore, it's a cost to everyone, physically, financially and socially."

The Health Department will carry out supplementary immunisation activity (SIA) in Bintulu starting on 2 Jul 2018, following a spike in measles cases there.

In a statement yesterday [22 Jun 2018], director Dr Jamilah Hashim said 84 cases tested positive for measles in Bintulu from January 2018 until 16 Jun 2018. In the same period last year [2017], no measles case was recorded.

"There are 11 areas identified as outbreak areas for measles in Bintulu Division, including housing estates, workers' settlements, and kindergartens. Because of this, the Sarawak State Health Department will implement the supplementary immunisation activity (SIA) to prevent occurrences of more measles cases. It will be conducted door to door from 8 am to 10 pm from Mondays to Sundays, including public holidays. The SIA is a preventive measure, which develops herd immunity against the spread of this disease. Children aged 6 months-15 years old in Bintulu will be screened. Parents are advised to give their fullest cooperation by preparing identity documents and health records of their children, including record of immunisation," she said.
