Scab outbreak in South Kashmir
------------------------------
Expressing serious concern over the outbreak of scab disease in apple orchards in South Kashmir and sub-standard pesticides sold in market, the [politician] Ghulam Nabi Malik has invited the attention of the state government to address the problem faced by the farmers and orchardists without any delay by ordering a general survey of the horticulture sector in valley.

He said that the Sher-e-Kashmir University of Agriculture Science and Technology (SKUAST) had prescribed various fungicides but unfortunately these are not available to farmers in the market. "This has created serious problems for the farmers and orchardists particularly in South Kashmir," he said.

Malik asserted that horticulture is the backbone of rural economy in J&K and more so in Kashmir valley. "[The recommended fungicides are] urgently required, as the new fruit season has already begun," he said.

[Apple scab (also called black spot) is caused by the fungus _Venturia inaequalis_ and is considered the most economically important disease of apples worldwide. Infected fruit is often unmarketable and losses can be more than 70 percent. The pathogen infects only species of _Malus_, while other fungi in the same genus are known to cause scab diseases on different fruit crops. Symptoms may include dark leaf spots, premature leaf fall, and fruit lesions. Early infections often result in severely cracked and malformed fruit and are most damaging since fruit becomes more resistant as it matures.

The fungus overwinters in infected leaves on the ground. Spores are spread with infected plant material, by mechanical means, splashing rain, and carried long distances in air currents. Disease management is expensive requiring up to 12 fungicide sprays a year in areas where scab has become established. Apple cultivars vary in their susceptibility to scab. Resistant varieties are available, but few of them are currently suitable for commercial production.
