Almost 200 persons with hepatitis A were treated in January 2009 in
the Latvian Centre for Infectious Diseases, Bajba Rosentale, the
Director of the Centre, stated. [Note that between 24 Sep 2008 & 2 Oct
2008 the number of confirmed cases of hepatitis A increased by 257,
reaching a total of 1016 confirmed cases, with a further 265 suspected
cases then under investigation -- see ProMED ref. Latvia below. -

During the past 24 hours [29-30 Jan 2009], 14 people have been
admitted to the centre on suspicion of having contracted hepatitis A
virus infection. The director acknowledged that such a high rate of
admissions indicated that there will be no immediate decrease in the
incidence of hepatitis A in the community. The prognosis is that a new
outbreak [upsurge?] will occur at the end of August 2009.

[Previously (see ProMED-mail archive ref. below), it was suggested
that a possible cause of the ongoing community-wide outbreak of
hepatitis A in Latvia in 2008 was a consequence of an accumulation of
susceptibles as a result of decreasing exposure to the virus.
Subsequently, increasing virus circulation in subgroups of the
population (such as drug users and migrants) was resulting in
increased transmission of infection to the wider population.
(Hepatitis A is transmitted by the fecal-oral route, but injecting
drug users can become infected by using contaminated equipment).

The epidemiology of the hepatitis A outbreak in Latvia has many
features in common with a contemporaneous outbreak in the Czech
Republic (see ProMED refs. below), although there has been no
established linkage. As of September 2008, 8 cases of hepatitis A
linked to Latvia had been registered in other European countries.
There exists a risk for international spread, especially among
travelers with risk behavior.

A reassessment of the epidemiological situation would be welcomed.
