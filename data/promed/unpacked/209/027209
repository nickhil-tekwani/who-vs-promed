The inhabitants of Sabana de Uchire say that the last large outbreak of leishmaniasis occurred in the year 89. They denounce that the lack of fumigation is one of the causes. Among those infected are children and older adults.

The World Health Organization (WHO) identifies cutaneous leishmaniasis as one of 3 forms of infection. On the skin, it looks like a welt that takes time to heal. With it, 66 people are infected in Sabana de Uchire, Bruzual municipality of Anzoátegui. Eliseo Uriepero is a resident of that parish and confirms it.

U is the father of an infected 5-year-old boy. By telephone, he informed El Pitazo on [3 May 2022] that there may be more patients for 3 reasons: mosquitoes abound in the area, people have not been able to go to the doctor and they have not fumigated for 20 years.

[It is most certainly correct that lack of vector control (fumigation) is a risk factor for the increase in case numbers. Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) in Venezuela is mainly an occupational disease, affecting, among others, farmers, hunters, and military personnel. It occurs throughout the Venezuelan territory, in 22 municipalities, and it can be considered both a rural and urban disease; 27 212 600 people are considered to be at risk for CL, while 21 397 700 are at risk for mucocutaneous leishmaniasis (MCL), in 14 municipalities.

The incidence is estimated at 9.9 per 100 000 inhabitants. As many as 80% of CL cases are caused by _L.braziliensis_, although other species have been demonstrated, including _L.infantum_. _L.braziliensis_ was found at a significant rate in dogs (up to 20%), but also in donkeys (up to 30%). During the period from 1988 to 2007, 47 762 cases of CL were reported, with an annual average of 2388 cases. Of this total, 98.5% are localized CL, 0.84% MCL, 0.5% intermediate CL and 0.16% DCL (Alvar J et al. and the Leishmaniasis Control Team. Leishmaniasis worldwide and global estimates of its incidence.
