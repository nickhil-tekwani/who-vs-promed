INFLUENZA PANDEMIC (H1N1) 2009 (05): VACCINE

[In the ProMED-mail post entitled: Influenza pandemic (H1N1) 2009
(03): vaccine, archive number 20090713.2505, it was stated that:

"As vaccines available initially will not be sufficient, a step-wise
approach to vaccinate particular groups may be considered."

Noel Miranda commented subsequently that:
"If we are concerned about shortage of supply of pandemic H1N1 2009
vaccines, it would be good to read about WHO recommending the use of
the proven and safe intradermal (ID) route of administration using
1/5th, or even 1/10th of the full intramuscular dose (or 0.1 ml per ID
dose). In this crisis, economy is very important. As the use of
adjuvants is under question because of safety issues, then using
non-adjuvanted pandemic flu vaccines intradermally should be discussed
and considered seriously, and WHO should take that lead soon.

"The following is one good study in support of the intradermal
administration of flu vaccines: "Dose sparing with intradermal
injection of influenza vacc!

Noel Miranda has sent the following additional comment in support of
this approach - Mod.CP]

I wish to inform you of my personal experience of pioneering ID
[intradermal] administration of rabies vaccines since the early 90s, a
method that has been well established as the routine regimen in
Thailand and in the Philippines since 1984 and 1993, respectively,
offering now perhaps millions of patients significant amounts of
savings of up to 60-80 percent compared with the application of the
standard full-course regimen. With savings there is also the benefit
of accessibility to a greater number. The WHO Expert Committee on
rabies has recommended the use of the ID regimen for rabies
post-exposure prophylaxis since 1991.

After this experience with rabies, other vaccines (including
influenza) have been tested along the same rationale (see the
references below). The immunological principles/bases are the same
regardless of the immunogen.
