https://www.gov.za/speeches/cabinet-approves-several-changes-adjusted-alert-level-1-covid-19-regulations-30-dec-2021


A special Cabinet meeting held earlier today, 30 Dec 2021, has approved several changes to the Adjusted Alert Level 1 COVID-19 regulations. This follows meetings of the National Coronavirus Command Council (NCCC) and the President's Coordinating Council (PCC), which received updates on the management of the current 4th wave of COVID-19 in South Africa, which is mainly driven by the omicron variant.

The information gathered through the system used by the Department of Health has reported a 29.7% decrease in the number of new cases detected in the week ending 25 Dec 2021 (89 781), compared to the number of new cases detected in the previous week (127 753). All indicators suggest the country may have passed the peak of the 4th wave at a national level.

Cases declined in all provinces except the Western Cape and Eastern Cape, which recorded increases of 14% and 18%, respectively. There has been a decline in hospital admissions in all provinces but the Western Cape.

While the omicron variant is highly transmissible, there have been lower rates of hospitalisation than in previous waves. This means that the country has a spare capacity for admission of patients even for routine health services. There is a marginal increase in the number of deaths in all the provinces.

Based on the trajectory of the pandemic, the levels of vaccination in the country and the available capacity within the health sector, Cabinet has decided to make the following changes to Adjusted Alert Level 1 with immediate effect:

- The curfew will be lifted. There will therefore be no restrictions on the hours of movement of people.
- Gatherings are restricted to no more than 1000 people indoors and no more than 2000 people outdoors. Where the venue is too small to accommodate these numbers with appropriate social distancing, then no more than 50% of the capacity of the venue may be used. All other restrictions remain in place.

The risk of increase in infections is still high given the high transmissibility of the omicron variant. Government therefore calls on all organisers of these gatherings to ensure that all health protocols are observed at all times and that all attendees are encouraged to be vaccinated.

- Alcohol establishments that have licences to operate beyond 23h00 will revert back to full licence conditions.

The NCCC will continue to closely monitor the situation and will make further adjustments as necessary, particularly if pressure on health facilities increases. The wearing of masks in public places is still mandatory, and failure to wear a mask when required remains a criminal offence. South Africans are urged to continue observing basic health protocols to prevent the transmission of the virus.

Vaccination remains the best defence against severe illness, hospitalisation and death from COVID-19. All people in South Africa who have not yet done so are encouraged to be vaccinated as soon as possible. This includes people who are eligible for booster shots.

Parents are reminded to support their children aged 12 years and older to use this opportunity to vaccinate before schools open. This will avoid learners losing school time as a result of testing positive or as a result of contact with people infected with COVID-19.

Government wishes to commend all South Africans who have observed the health regulations and protocols over the festive season. Government urges everyone to continue to act cautiously and responsibly over the new year and for the remainder of the holiday season.

[2] France: omicron cases
Date: Fri 31 Dec 2021 9:29 AM CET
Source: France 24 [edited]
https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20211231-covid-19-omicron-is-now-dominant-variant-in-france


Omicron has become the main coronavirus strain in France, where the number of new infections has topped 200 000 for 2 days in a row. The public health agency said in its latest weekly survey published on Thursday [30 Dec 2021] that "62.4% of tests showed a profile compatible with the omicron variant" at the start of the week compared with 15% the previous week.

The omicron variant's advance was expected because it is highly contagious and has become dominant in other European countries, including Britain and Portugal. The strain has contributed to the current flare-up in cases, which surpassed 200 000 in the 24-hour period from Thursday-Friday [30-31 Dec 2021] for the 3rd day in a row, with 232 200 new cases reported.

At the beginning of December [2021], there were fewer than 50 000 daily cases. In early November [2021], the daily total broke the 10 000 threshold for the first time since mid-September [2021]. French hospitals are now caring for 18 000 COVID-19 patients, including 1922 new admissions between Wednesday [29 Dec 2021] and Thursday [30 Dec 2021], with more than 3500 people in intensive care.

Faced with the wave of infections, the government announced Monday [26 Dec 2021] new curbs to make people work from home and imposed limits on the numbers attending public events. Schools are nevertheless set to reopen on schedule on Monday [3 Jan 2022] after the holiday break. Wearing face masks outdoors is again compulsory in Paris for everyone over the age of 11 starting on Friday [31 Dec 2021].

The virus has claimed 123 741 lives in France since it was detected in China in late 2019.

[3] UK: update
Date: Fri 31 Dec 2021 (update; original was published 1 Oct 2021)

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/covid-19-variants-identified-in-the-uk


The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has published a new variant technical briefing containing updated analysis on omicron hospitalisation risk and vaccine efficacy against symptomatic disease and hospitalisation.

Protection against hospitalisation from vaccines is good against the omicron variant. One dose of any vaccine was associated with a 35% reduced risk of hospitalisation among symptomatic cases with the omicron variant, 2 doses with a 67% reduction up to 24 weeks after the 2nd dose and a 51% reduced risk 25 or more weeks after the 2nd dose. A 3rd dose was associated with a 68% (95% confidence interval 52 to 82%) reduced risk of hospitalisation when compared to similar unvaccinated individuals. When the reduced risk of hospitalisation was combined with vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic disease, the vaccine effectiveness against hospitalisation was estimated as 52% after one dose, 72% 2-24 weeks after dose 2, 52% 25+ weeks after dose 2 and 88% 2 weeks after a booster dose.

As set out last week, the effectiveness of all vaccines against symptomatic infection continues to be lower in all periods against omicron compared to delta. The latest data confirmed that among those who had received 2 doses of AstraZeneca, there was no effect against omicron from 20 weeks after the 2nd dose. Among those who had received 2 doses of Pfizer or Moderna, effectiveness dropped from around 65-70% down to around 10% by 20 weeks after the 2nd dose. Two to 4 weeks after a booster dose, vaccine effectiveness ranged from around 65-75%, dropping to 55-70% at 5-9 weeks and 40-50% from 10+ weeks after the booster.

Working alongside Cambridge University MRC Biostatistics unit, UKHSA analysed 528 176 omicron cases and 573 012 delta cases between 22 Nov and 26 Dec 2021 to assess the risk of hospitalisation in England after testing positive for omicron. This analysis found that the risk of presentation to emergency care or hospital admission with omicron (testing for symptomatic or asymptomatic infection) was approximately half of that for delta, while the risk of hospital admission alone with omicron was approximately one-third of that for delta. In this analysis, the risk of hospitalisation is lower for omicron cases with symptomatic or asymptomatic infection after 2 and 3 doses of vaccine, with an 81% (95% confidence interval 77-85%) reduction in the risk of hospitalisation after 3 doses compared to unvaccinated omicron cases.

This analysis is not an assessment of hospital severity, which will take further time to assess.

Health and social care secretary Sajid Javid said: "This is more promising data which reinforces just how important vaccines are. They save lives and prevent serious illness. This analysis shows you are up to 8 times more likely to end up in hospital as a result of COVID-19 if you are unvaccinated. It is never too late to come forward for your 1st dose and it's vital that everyone comes forward to get boosted now as we head into the new year."

Susan Hopkins, chief medical adviser at UKHSA, said: "The latest set of analysis is in keeping with the encouraging signs we have already seen. However, it remains too early to draw any definitive conclusions on hospital severity, and the increased transmissibility of omicron and the rising cases in the over 60s population in England means it remains highly likely that there will be significant pressure on the NHS in coming weeks. The data once again show that coming forward for your jab, particularly your 3rd dose, is the best way of protecting yourself and others against infection and severe disease."

South African study suggests nasal swabs aren't the best way to test for omicron
--------------------------------------------------------------------
If confirmed in follow-up research and if the diagnostics industry can pivot quickly enough, findings from a South African study could make COVID-19 testing a lot easier for patients and healthcare workers, as the SARS-CoV-2 omicron variant becomes the dominant source of infection. In a manuscript posted to the medRxiv preprint server on Friday [24 Dec 2021], researchers from the University of Cape Town reported that saliva samples yielded more accurate results in PCR analyses when omicron was involved than those collected via nasal swabs.

When patients carried the delta variant, on the other hand, nasal swabs were more accurate, according to the group, led by Diana Hardie, who also heads the diagnostic virology laboratory at Groote Schuur Hospital. The findings came from an analysis of 382 patients tested at Groote Schuur from August [2021] through [December 2021], with viral whole-genome sequencing performed on isolates from those with positive results. Just over 300 were tested before omicron's emergence, with 31 testing positive for the delta variant. Another 74 arrived at the hospital after omicron became common, of whom 36 were positive for that variant.

All patients had both saliva and mid-turbinate nasal samples taken for RT-PCR analysis. The "gold standard" for positivity in the study was detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA with either [sic. I think they mean "both", as the authors refer to their gold standard as a "composite standard" https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2021/12/24/2021.12.22.21268246.full.pdf. - Mod.SH] swab. For the delta variant, the positive percent agreement for each sampling method, in comparison with this "gold standard," was 71% for saliva and 100% for the nasal swabs. But this was reversed for omicron, with 100% agreement between saliva samples and the gold standard, but only 86% for nasal swabs.

Nasal swabs have been the standard for COVID-19 screening and diagnosis ever since the virus was discovered, but that may no longer be appropriate in an omicron-dominated pandemic landscape, the authors concluded. "These findings suggest that the pattern of viral shedding during the course of infection is altered for omicron with higher viral shedding in saliva relative to nasal samples resulting in improved diagnostic performance of saliva swabs," Hardie and colleagues wrote.

They noted, as have others, that omicron is distinguished by "more than 50 distinct mutations". These seem to have resulted in increased infectivity, but they could also affect other aspects of the virus's behavior, including the tissues it may prefer to infect.

With that in mind, Hardie's group pointed to a recent lab study from Hong Kong (as yet unpublished but highlighted in a press release) indicating that omicron is less likely to lodge in the lung compared with earlier variants. This not only suggests that omicron is less lethal, but also that the many mutations confer "altered tissue tropism." [https://www.med.hku.hk/en/news/press/20211215-omicron-sars-cov-2-infection]

However, while saliva sampling may be easier to perform than nasal swabbing, the researchers noted that it's not as simple as spitting in a cup. At Groote Schuur, patients were instructed to swab the inside of the mouth -- both cheeks, above and below the tongue, the gums, and hard palate -- for a total of at least 30 seconds. They were also told not to eat, drink, smoke, or chew anything for at least 30 minutes beforehand.

Another point to consider is that, in the United States and most other countries, testing has been predicated primarily on nasal swabs. Although some saliva-based tests have been authorized and are commercially available, the vast majority of currently accessible kits for healthcare use and for at-home self-testing rely on nasal swabs. It would likely take months to retool the supply chain to prioritize saliva sampling -- by which time omicron may have been supplanted by another variant with its own unique characteristics.

[Marais G, Hsiao N-Y, Iranzadeh A, et al. Saliva swabs are the preferred sample for omicron detection. MedRxiv preprint. DOI: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.12.22.21268246; this version posted 24 Dec 2021.

Abstract
"The omicron variant is characterised by more than 50 distinct mutations, the majority of which are located in the spike protein. The implications of these mutations for disease transmission, tissue tropism and diagnostic testing are still to be determined. We evaluated the relative performance of saliva and mid-turbinate swabs as RT PCR samples for the delta and omicron variants. The positive percent agreement (PPA) of saliva swabs and mid-turbinate swabs to a composite standard was 71% (95% CI: 53-84%) and 100% (95% CI: 89-100%), respectively, for the delta variant. However, for the omicron variant saliva and mid-turbinate swabs had a 100% (95% CI: 90-100%) and 86% (95% CI: 71-94%) PPA, respectively. This finding supports ex-vivo data of altered tissue tropism from other labs for the omicron variant. Reassessment of the diagnostic testing standard-of-care may be required as the omicron variant become the dominant variant worldwide."

Conclusion
"These findings suggest that the pattern of viral shedding during the course of infection is altered for omicron with higher viral shedding in saliva relative to nasal samples resulting in improved diagnostic performance of saliva swabs. This supports the ex-vivo finding of improved viral replication in upper respiratory tract tissue and possibly altered tissue tropism. This is an important finding as the current standard of care for diagnosis using swabs of the nasal or nasopharyngeal mucosa may be suboptimal for the omicron variant."

This is an important finding since all the current rapid tests are based on nasal swabs. Since experimental results with delta were different from those with omicron, while both strains are circulating the best protocol would be combined saliva and nasal swab samples. But that would take a redesign of the diagnostic assay. - Mod.LK]

[In the past 24 hours, 22 countries -- the USA (443 677), France (232 200), the UK (189 836), Italy (144 255), Argentina (47 663), Turkey (40 786), Canada (41 217), Greece (40 560), Germany (33 466), Australia (33 081), Portugal (30 829), India (21 981), Russia (20 638), Ireland (20 110), Vietnam (16 515), The Netherlands (16 706), Poland (13 607), South Africa (11 754), Finland (11 334), Colombia (10 401), Brazil (10 282), and Mexico (10 037) -- all reported over 10 000 newly confirmed cases. A global total of 6622 deaths were reported in the 24 hours from late 29 Dec 2021 to late 30 Dec 2021. The exponential rise in cases over the last couple of weeks can be attributed to the rapid increase in the omicron variant cases in over 90 countries.

Studies suggest that the omicron variant causes milder disease than the previously dominant delta variant, but the large numbers of cases caused by this highly infectious/transmissible variant could rapidly overwhelm hospitals and health systems. However, the major differences resulting from testing delays over the holiday period will likely continue over the coming weekend. The rolling 7-day averages provide a more precise indicator to follow the trends of the pandemic, which suggest an increasing global trend of cases with some reduction in deaths.

A total of 70 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 41 of the 70 countries are from the European region, 9 are from the Americas region, 5 are from the Western Pacific region, 2 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 3 from the South East Asia region, and 10 are from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have increased by 71.5%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 7.4%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 96.9 % increase in daily reported cases and a 15.6% decrease in reported deaths.

Impression: Globally more than 1.6 million newly confirmed infections were reported in the past 24 hours, with over 288.51 million cumulative reported cases and over 5.45 million reported deaths. - Mod.UBA]
