AQIS confirms Sharka disease
----------------------------
Officials of the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service at Sydney's
Mascot Airport have seized plant material infected by the highly virulent
[plum pox potyvirus which causes Sharka disease. Australia is currently
free of [the disease, which could put at risk apricots, plums, peaches,
nectarines and cherries, industries which contribute to a [annual farm gate
value of 200 million dollars.
Quarantine Awareness Officer Angela Sharpe [said a passenger from Europe
was found with 5 kilograms of illegal material, including infected plums
and budwood. She said that the disease [renders the fruit unsightly and
inedible. [Premature fruit drop combined with the unsightly symptoms
devastates stonefruit production, [resulting in heavy economic losses.

[This is a classical example of trying to smuggle plant material into a
country. The illegal shipment was actually detected by a sniffer dog at the
airport. Confirmation of the disease followed laboratory tests at the AQIS
facility in Sydney. Kudos to AQIS personnel who foiled the attempt.
Smuggling of infected plant material into another country bypasses the
normal testing of imported material under quarantine, thus leading to
propagation and distribution of infected planting material. A copy of the
press release (19 Sep 2000) can be obtained at the following website:
