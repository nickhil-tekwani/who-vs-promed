OIE-WAHIS: A new era for animal health data
----------------------------------------------
"At a time when the world is facing an unprecedented pandemic, the importance of animal disease surveillance has become evident. To support countries maintaining global transparency and reporting matters of animal and public health, the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) launches the leading most technologically advanced reference platform for animal disease and veterinary capacities reporting - the World Animal Health Information System (OIE-WAHIS)".

Paris, [18 Mar 2021] "Since its creation in 1924, the OIE is the mandated international organization collecting data on, observing and analyzing animal diseases throughout the world. Through its current World Animal Health Information System (WAHIS), the Organization ensures the prompt dissemination of information on potentially devastating outbreaks and facilitates decision making in terms of international trade of animals and animal products by collecting, verifying and publishing official animal health information, following a standardized process, thus providing high quality, reliable data.

"Today more than ever, the international community recognizes the importance of maintaining a global perspective and foresight on animal health and its inextricable connection with public health. Animal disease surveillance allows early detection of potentially impactful animal and human health threats and thus, the prompt implementation of appropriate control measures by the competent national authorities. This can only be achieved by enabling timely access to reliable information about the global state of animal diseases. With official information provided by OIE Members, OIE-WAHIS becomes a key component of the global fight against animal and human diseases.

"The sustained spread of COVID-19, as well as current animal epidemics like African swine fever or Avian influenza remind us the value of timely disease notification and information sharing. OIE-WAHIS will enable easier reporting and open-access to data," said Dr. Monique Eloit, OIE Director General.

"OIE-WAHIS will make information about animal health more easily available and usable to everyone who needs it - government agencies, trade partners, international organizations, industry, researchers, academics, journalists and society in general - free of charge, becoming the reference platform. The new platform will make it easy for countries to collect and report information - and upload data from their own databases. Its user-friendly interface will also allow for data to be viewed, analyzed and extracted in different formats. OIE-WAHIS is a 1st cornerstone in the digital transformation of the OIE. It enables an easy and standardized way to connect with other information systems around the world, making data analysis even more powerful.

"On a global scale, the spread of animal diseases poses a threat to public health, food security, economic and rural development. By enabling better understanding on animal disease trends, OIE-WAHIS will provide the opportunity to implement timely measures to curb the spread of diseases, as well as their devastating consequences".

The development of the new OIE-WAHIS system was made possible thanks to the financial support: Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, European Union, Maris Llorens Foundation, Canada, People's Republic of China, France, Germany, Japan, Mexico, Russian Federation, Switzerland, United Kingdom and the United States of America.

[The OIE is congratulated for launching the new animal health database - the OIE-WAHIS System.

"OIE-WAHIS (OIE World Animal Health Information System) is a unique comprehensive database through which information on the animal health situation worldwide is reported and disseminated throughout the world. OIE-WAHIS data reflects the information gathered by the Veterinary Services from OIE Members and non-Members Countries and Territories on OIE-listed diseases in domestic animals and wildlife, as well as on emerging diseases and zoonoses.

"All this information can be publicly accessed and visualized on this interface. OIE-WAHIS replaces and significantly extends the former web interface named WAHIS providing access to all reported data since 2005. This new public interface includes data extraction tools, interactive mapping tools, and dashboards to support data consultation, visualization, and extraction of officially validated animal health data."

For ProMED, the OIE-WAHIS database, as well as the thousands of postings linked to country-specific immediate notifications, follow-up reports, maps, etc. is an important source of country official information. The previous system, known simply as WAHIS (World Animal Health Information System), ceased to exist for all users on 19 Feb 2021. Unfortunately, all of the links within archived ProMED postings to the previous WAHIS platform are no longer available. ProMED users can search for the relevant historic event in the new platform, OIE-WAHIS in the link indicated below.
