[1] Sierra Leone
Date: 23 Aug 2014 [received 24 Aug 2014]

EVD outbreak update: As of today [23 Aug 2014] we have a total of 236 patients who have survived Ebola virus disease and subsequently been discharged. The total number of new confirmed cases for today is 56: Kailahun 6, Kenema 13; Bombali 6; Tonkolili 2; Port Loko 14; Pujehun 1; Bo 6; Moyamba 1 and Western Area [Freetown] 10.

The total number of cumulative confirmed deaths is 333 and cumulative number of confirmed cases is 881 with: Kailahun 417, Kenema 303; Kono 1; Kambia 1; Bombali 17; Tonkolili 10; Port Loko 47; Pujehun 5; Bo 33; Moyamba 9; Bonthe 1; Western Area Urban 26; Western Area Rural 11. Koinadugu district still remains the only district that has not registered confirmed cases of EVD in Sierra Leone.

The cumulative number of probable cases is 36 and probable deaths 34, while the total cumulative number of suspected cases is 49 and suspected deaths is 8.

The United Nations high level delegation headed by the Special Representative of the UN Secretary General for Food and Nutrition, David Nabarro, is currently in Freetown to assess the current EVD response in the country. The team visited the Emergency Operations Center (EOC) where they met with the Minister of Health and Sanitation and a cross-section of members of the EOC to discuss the progress the country has made so far in the fight against the Ebola virus disease (EVD) and the challenges.

The Minister of Health and Sanitation, Miatta Kargbo, in her welcome address informed the delegation that though the country still faces challenges, much progress has been made, especially in the epicenter districts of Kenema and Kailahun, with the measures government has put in place, such as declaring the state of emergency and isolating those 2 epicenter districts and the quarantining of homes with confirmed cases across the country. She highlighted the shortage of clinical expertise and logistics, ranging from transportation to protective gear and food supplies for quarantined homes and epicenter districts, as the major challenges facing the fight against the EVD outbreak in Sierra Leone.

The delegation discussed several issues such as health worker incentives and donor support to Sierra Leone. The head of the delegation, David Nabarro, while addressing the meeting, said that the Secretary General is concerned about the growing frustration from Sierra Leone with the slow financial support coming from the donors to support the fight against the outbreak and went further that they have been sent by the UN Secretary General to find out why donors have been slow to release funds that they have committed to the countries affected. He further disclosed that the World Bank has committed USD 6 million to Sierra Leone that could be used to support contact tracing activities and health worker incentives and suggested some innovative ways these incentives could be paid to the health workers, such as using the telephone banking system or mobile phone system available in the country. The Minister of Health and Sanitation was, however, quick to inform the delegation that the country has yet to receive the USD 6 million committed by the World Bank.

The delegation is scheduled to meet with the donor community and the Non- Governmental Organizations operating in Sierra Leone later tonight [23 Aug 2014] and with His Excellency the President Dr. Ernest Bai Koroma tomorrow to discuss the EVD response in Sierra Leone. Other members of the delegation include the Regional Director for the World Food Programme, the Regional Director of the Office of Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA); the Deputy Regional Director for UNICEF and the WHO Assistant Director General for Health Safety.

[2] Sierra Leone, other news

23 Aug 2014: The UK government has confirmed that a British national who is living in Sierra Leone has EVD, making this the 1st British person to be infected in this outbreak. Media reports say the patient is a man who was volunteering as a nurse and caring for EVD patients... Officials are assessing the situation to ensure the person is cared for and are providing consular assistance. This case does not change the EVD risk in the UK, which remains low.
https://www.internationalsos.com/ebola/index.cfm?content_id=407&language_id=ENG

[24 Aug 2014: He was evacuated to the UK on a Royal Air Force jet, Sierra Leone's health ministry has said. He will be taken to the Royal Free Hospital in London, which has been specially prepared to keep EVD cases in isolation and treat them (see photo in link) http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/aug/24/briton-with-ebola-flown-home-sierra-leone. - Mod.JW]

--
23 Aug 2014: Sierra Leone: Media reports indicate that it is now a crime to harbor EVD victims, which can be punished with 2 years of jail time. Parliament approved a regulation that involves "summary trial" for anyone believed to be breaking this law.

24 Aug 2014: WHO medic tests EVD positive as Briton evacuated. A Senegalese epidemiologist has become the 1st World Health Organization worker to test positive for the deadly Ebola virus disease wreaking havoc in West Africa. The unnamed official was based in Kailahun district [Sierra Leone] tracing EVD cases. A statement from the WHO says the organisation will ensure he receives "the best care possible including the option of medical evacuation to another care facility if necessary." He is one of over 400 people the agency and its Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) partners have deployed in the region in response to the outbreak, since it [was recognized] in March [2014]. Since the current outbreak, more than 225 health workers have fallen ill, and nearly 130 have died of the disease. WHO says international health workers are an important part of the EVD response because it comes after years of [armed] conflict in which "the area of West Africa most affected by this disease suffered from a weakened and fragile health system with a shortage of health workers."

[Epidemiologists typically visit households to interview people for details of how a disease spreads and do not wear the full protective gear used by hospital personnel. To be infected, he must have had contact either with a symptomatic case or with something contaminated by a case. - Mod.JW]

[3] Decontamination
Date: 24 Aug 2014
From: Brian Petuch Text <2672783711@vtext.com> [edited]


[ProMED commented that perhaps ethylene oxide (ETO) could be used to decontaminate the clothing and small personal effects left behind in Liberia by Dr Brantly and his family instead of destroying them; see: Ebola virus disease - West Africa (136): Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Liberia, more ProMED Archive No. 20140823.2717179. - Mod.JW].

The current standard for whole room and small item decontamination is vaporized hydrogen peroxide or chlorine dioxide. It is now a staple for laboratory and equipment decontamination as well as for production areas. Perhaps the US CDC or other organizations supporting West African clinical laboratories could provide a link to a supplier. This is the same technology used to decontaminate US post offices during the anthrax incidents. It is very portable and much safer to use.

ETO is far too dangerous to ship and set up, as well as requiring extensive aeration to remove ETO residues, which are considered probably carcinogenic.

This is my professional opinion as a biosafety professional, not that of my employer.

China
-----
23 Aug 2014: China's health authorities have stepped up control measures against EVD in the past week in the wake of the continuing epidemic in West Africa. The National Health and Family Planning Commission distributed a protocol for diagnosis, treatment, and fast response to EVD cases to 31 provincial health departments on Thu [21 Aug 2014]...

Cote d'Ivoire
------
Meanwhile, Ivory Coast announced on Sat [23 Aug 2014] that it is closing its borders in response to the EVD outbreak in West Africa. Prime Minister Daniel Duncan signed the order that closes the land borders that Ivory Coast shares with Guinea and Liberia. The borders will remain closed until further notice in an effort to prevent ebolavirus from spreading into its territory, according to the government statement.

India
-----
24 Aug 2014: Mumbai: A 32-year-old man suspected to have contracted the deadly ebolavirus was quarantined on his return from Nigeria on Sunday evening [24 Aug 2014]. The passenger was directly taken to the designated Bal Thackeray Trauma Care Centre in Jogeshwari, where he has been quarantined. Airport officials said that he had "bloodshot eyes, a running nose and fever" and was, therefore, sent to the civic-run hospital. The Emirates passenger, who flew in via Dubai, came from Nigeria...

Liberia
-------
23 Aug 2014: The World Health Organization (WHO) will strengthen the fight against Ebola virus disease with the provision of 500 additional beds in Monrovia, the capital of Liberia, the African country most affected by the epidemic. WHO stressed, however, that the number of beds "is insufficient" given the increasing number of patients, because the epidemic has destabilized the health system and created tensions within society...

[6] How you can help

[If you cannot volunteer to join one of the groups with boots on the ground in West Africa -- see MSF call for assistance with EVD crisis, ProMED Archive No.: 20140822.2714638 -- there is a good review of organizations receiving donations for the fight against EVD at: http://abcnewsradioonline.com/health-news/why-theres-no-viral-fundraiser-to-help-fight-ebola.html. - Mod.JW]

[The infection of 2 more international health workers is a serious blow (because it will make people think twice about volunteering) to recruiting more overseas staff, who are desperately needed to complement national staff in isolation hospitals that are rapidly being filled faster than they can be built. The count is inescapable: For every 100 new beds provided, they are filled daily with new cases, so even if 50 patients die and another 50 are discharged every day, there is still a shortage of beds for the patients who must remain under observation for the full 21 days post treatment. - Mod.JW
