The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health is
investigating a case of influenza A (H9N2) infection -- a mild form
of avian influenza -- involving a 35-month-old girl.

A spokesman for CHP said today [23 Dec 2009] that the girl, living in
Sha Tin, developed symptoms of cough, fever, and runny nose in late
November 2009. She was admitted to the Prince of Wales Hospital and
was discharged on 11 Dec 2009. She has now recovered.

Influenza A (H9N2) was detected in the patient's respiratory
specimen. Investigation is ongoing, and the department will inform
the World Health Organization.

Influenza A (H9) is an avian influenza virus which has been isolated
from ducks and chickens for many years. Infection in humans is rare
and appears to present as a mild disease.

This is the 7th time that H9 viruses were found in humans in Hong
Kong. Five females and a male were confirmed to have suffered from H9
infection in 1999, 2003, 2007, 2008 and 2009.

"Hong Kong has a comprehensive avian influenza surveillance programme
to detect the presence of any avian influenza in our environment, and
the possible reassortment of the viruses, so that prompt responsive
measures can be taken," the spokesman said.

As a precautionary measure, people are reminded to avoid contact with
live poultry to minimise the chance of being infected with avian
influenza. "Hands should be washed thoroughly with soap and water
after handling live poultry. To build up good body resistance against
influenza, the public are encouraged to maintain a balanced diet, do
regular exercise, and have adequate rest. They should not smoke." he said.

[In 1999, an influenza A (H9N2) virus was isolated from 2 patients
(aged one and 4 years old) by the Virus Unit of the Hong Kong
Department of Health. Both girls recovered fully. This was the 1st
occasion that an H9N2 virus had been isolated from humans in Hong
Kong, although influenza A (H9N2) viruses had been isolated from
ducks and chickens for several years previously. Another human case
occurred in March 2007, again a mildly ill child. In each instance,
there was no further spread of infection. In 2007 a child became ill
in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen and was hospitalised in Hong
kong, and in 2008 a 2-month-old Hong Kong-born infant living in China
was H9N2-positive. In none of these cases was there evidence of
human-to-human transmission of H9N2 virus infection.

There is no indication that the current case is any more severe than
the preceding cases. The circumstances relating to the transmission
of H9N2 avian influenza virus to humans remain to be defined. - Mod.CP]
