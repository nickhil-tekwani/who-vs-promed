(Date of last previously reported outbreak: November 1997).
Extract from the monthly report of the People's Republic of China for July
1998, received on 25 September 1998 from the Director of the Department of
Animal Husbandry and Health, Ministry of Agriculture, Beijing:
Outbreaks of foot and mouth disease in July 1998: two (2) districts infected
in Yunnan province (in the south of the country).
--
[It was believed that last year's Taiwan FMD outbreak followed upon the
smuggling of infected pigs from southern China - Mod.MHJ
[Note: we checked, and the original OIE report does NOT specify what
type of livestock is involved. Note also that the outbreak occurred
last July, but was reported by China only in September - Mod.JW
