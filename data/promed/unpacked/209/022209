Pink Eye Spreading Quickly Among School Children
------------------------------------------------
Public health authorities have issued a warning against epidemic
keratoconjunctivitis ("pink eye") and acute hemorrhagic
conjunctivitis (called "Apollo eye disease" in Korea) as the summer
vacation ends and the new semester begins.
The Korea Center for Disease Control and Prevention said Thursday [23
Aug 2007] that pink eye has affected a growing number of people in
South Jeolla, Gangwon and North Gyeongsang areas this month [August 2007].
The number of patients suffering from Apollo eye has been rising
sharply in Ulsan, Gyeongsang and Seoul since last week [13-17 Aug
2007]. KCDCP official Park Ok said that eye diseases rear up every
August when school resumes after the summer break.
Young people aged 10 to 19 account for 30 percent of all patients.
The illnesses are particularly rampant in Ulsan and South Gyeongsang Province.

[Epidemics of keratoconjunctivitis ("pink eye") and acute hemorrhagic
conjunctivitis (called "Apollo eye" disease) occur frequently
throughout the world during the autumn, caused by a variety of
viruses. Information on the identity of the viruses responsible for
the current outbreaks in Korea would be appreciated. - Mod.CP]
