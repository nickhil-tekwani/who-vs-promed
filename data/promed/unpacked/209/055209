Whirling Disease Parasite Found on Wind River Indian Reservation
-------------------------------------------------------
RIVERTON, Wyo. (AP) - The parasite that causes whirling disease in trout
has been found in the North Fork of the Popo Agie River. The discovery is a
first for the Wind River Indian Reservation. The parasite has been
discovered elsewhere in Wyoming.
Nearly 60 percent of brown trout tested at a fishing spot at the Second
Street Bridge just outside of Lander had the parasite, said Dave Skates,
project leader for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Officials plan to
look at other waters on the reservation to see how widespread the disease
is, he said.
Whirling disease can kill young trout, especially rainbow trout. The
disease attacks cartilage in the head and spine, sometimes causing fish to
develop whirling behavior. The North Fork of the Popo Agie River is one of
the most productive trout streams in the Wind River Basin. It borders the
reservation to the south and is managed by state and federal wildlife
agencies. It is too early to tell whether rainbow trout numbers are
dwindling, but very few rainbow trout were found at the fishing spot near
the bridge during the testing in Oct 1999, Skates said. The lack of rainbow
trout could be a result of brown trout moving into the territory to spawn
and displacing the rainbow trout, he said.
Last summer, the whirling disease parasite was found in the Jakey's Fork of
the Wind River and at a state fish hatchery in Dubois. "We haven't really
rigorously sampled for fish health diseases a lot in the past," Skates
said. "With whirling disease, we felt we were in pretty good shape." "The
only thing we can really do is monitor the situation and see where it
goes," said Dave Dufek, fisheries supervisor for the Wyoming Game and Fish
Department in Lander.
