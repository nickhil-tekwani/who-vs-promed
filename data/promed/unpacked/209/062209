[For the above and additional background information, including diagnostic methods, please refer to the OIE Terrestrial Manual 2016, Chapter 2.3.2 "Avian infectious bronchitis" at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.03.02_AIB.pdf, from which the following commentary is quoted:

"Avian infectious bronchitis (IB) is caused by the gammacoronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). The virus causes infections mainly in chickens and is a significant pathogen of commercial meat and egg type birds. IB is an acute, contagious disease characterised primarily by respiratory signs in growing chickens. In hens, decreased egg production and quality are often observed. Some strains of the virus are nephropathogenic and produce interstitial nephritis and mortality. The severity of IBV-induced respiratory disease is enhanced by the presence of other pathogens, including bacteria, leading to chronic complicated airsacculitis. Diagnosis of IB requires virus isolation or demonstration of viral nucleic acid from diseased flocks. Demonstration of a rising serum antibody response may also be useful. The widespread use of live and inactivated vaccines may complicate both the interpretation of virus isolation and serology findings. The occurrence of antigenic variant strains may overcome immunity induced by vaccination.

"Diagnosis requires laboratory testing. Virus detection and identification is preferred. Reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) techniques are commonly used to identify the IBV genotype. Haemagglutination inhibition (HI) tests to determine serotype (appropriate in young birds) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) are often used for sero-diagnosis and/or monitoring. Supplementary tests include electron microscopy, the use of monoclonal antibodies, virus neutralisation (VN), immunohistochemical or immunofluorescence tests, and immunization challenge trials in chickens."

There have been no reports of human infection with IBV. - Mod.CRD
