_Acinetobacter baumannii_ infections among patients at military medical
facilities treating injured USA service members, 2002-2004
----------------------------------------------------
_Acinetobacter baumannii_ is a well known but relatively uncommon cause of
health care associated infections. Because the organism has developed
substantial antimicrobial resistance, treatment of infections attributed to
_A. baumannii_ has become increasingly difficult (1). This report describes
an increasing number of _A. baumannii_ bloodstream infections in patients
at military medical facilities in which service members injured in the
Iraq/Kuwait region during Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and in Afghanistan
during Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) were treated.
The number of these infections and their resistance to multiple
antimicrobial agents underscore 1) the importance of infection control
during treatment in combat and health care settings and 2) the need to
develop new antimicrobial drugs to treat these infections.
From 1 Jan 2002 to 31 Aug 2004, military health officials identified 102
patients with blood cultures that grew _A. baumannii_ at military medical
facilities treating service members injured in Afghanistan and the
Iraq/Kuwait region. All of these cases met the criteria for _A. baumannii_
bloodstream infection on the basis of criteria established by the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention's National Nosocomial Infection
Surveillance (NNIS) system (2). Of these 102 cases, 85 (83 per cent) were
associated with activities during OIF and OEF. Most of the infections were
reported from Landstuhl Regional Medical Center (LRMC), Germany (33
patients: 32 OIF/OEF casualties, 1 non-OIF/OEF), and Walter Reed Army
Medical Center (WRAMC), District of Columbia (45 patients: 29 OIF/OEF
casualties, 16 non-OIF/OEF). In both facilities, the number of patients
with _A. baumannii_ bloodstream infections in 2003 and 2004 exceeded those
reported in previous years (1 case during 2000--2002 at LRMC; 2 cases
during 2001--2002 at WRAMC).
Of the 33 patients with _A. baumannii_ bloodstream infections at LRMC, 32
(97 per cent) were men; the median age was 30 years (range: 19-72). 30 (91
per cent) patients sustained traumatic injuries in either the Iraq/Kuwait
region (25) or in Afghanistan (5). Most (67 per cent) were active-duty
members of the USA Armed Forces. 32 (97 per cent) were transferred directly
to the LRMC intensive care unit (ICU) from a combat theater military
medical facility. In 22 (67 per cent) of these patients, bloodstream
infections were detected from blood cultures obtained within 48 hours of
ICU admission.
Of the 45 patients with _A. baumannii_ bloodstream infections at WRAMC, 39
(87 per cent) were males; the median age was 39 years (range: 6-86). 29 (64
per cent) patients sustained traumatic injuries in the Iraq/Kuwait region.
Of these, 18 (62 per cent) had bloodstream infections detected from blood
cultures obtained within 48 hours of hospital admission after transfer from
a combat theater medical or other military medical facility.
Antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) was performed by using
microdilution. Results of 33 _A. baumannii_ isolates from LRMC and 45
isolates from WRAMC indicated widespread resistance to antimicrobial agents
commonly used to treat infections with this organism. AST results,
expressed as a percentage of susceptible isolates, were as follows:
imipenem (LRMC: 87 per cent; WRAMC: 82 per cent), amikacin (LRMC: 80 per
cent; WRAMC: 48 per cent), ampicillin/sulbactam (LRMC: 8 per cent; WRAMC:
35 per cent), piperacillin/tazobactam (LRMC: 0 per cent; WRAMC: 27 per
cent), cefepime (LRMC: 0 per cent; WRAMC: 22 per cent), and ciprofloxacin
(LRMC: 3 per cent; WRAMC: 20 per cent).
Among the WRAMC isolates, 13 (35 per cent) were susceptible to imipenem
only, and 2 (4 per cent) were resistant to all drugs tested. One
antimicrobial agent, colistin (polymyxin E), has been used to treat
infections with multidrug resistant _A. baumannii_; however, AST for
colistin was not performed on isolates described in this report.
In addition to LRMC and WRAMC, 3 other military treatment facilities have
identified _A. baumannii_ bloodstream infections in service members injured
in Iraq, Kuwait, and Afghanistan: USA Navy hospital ship (USNS) Comfort (11
patients), National Naval Medical Center (NNMC), Bethesda, Maryland (8),
and Brooke Army Medical Center (BAMC), San Antonio, Texas (5).

Editorial note:
_A. baumannii_ is a species of Gram negative bacteria commonly found in
water and soil. During 1963-2003, _A. baumannii_ became an increasingly
important cause of nosocomial infections, particularly in ICUs (3).
Treatment of infections attributed to _A. baumannii_ can be difficult
because the organism has intrinsic resistance to certain antimicrobial
agents and has acquired resistance to many others (3). In health care
settings, colonized and infected patients are often the sources of _A.
baumannii_ infections; however, the ability of the organism to survive for
prolonged periods on environmental surfaces also has contributed to
protracted outbreaks in these settings (1).
In a recent national survey of hospital laboratories, _A. baumannii_
infections accounted for only 1.3 per cent of health-care-associated
bloodstream infections (4). However, the findings in this report indicate
an increase in the number of reported _A. baumannii_ bloodstream infections
in patients at military medical facilities in which service members injured
in Iraq, Kuwait, and Afghanistan are treated.
The sources of the _A. baumannii_ that led to the infections described in
this report are under investigation. During the Vietnam War, _A. baumannii_
was reported to be the most common Gram negative bacillus recovered from
traumatic injuries to extremities, and more recent reports have identified
_A. baumannii_ infections in patients who suffered traumatic injuries,
suggesting environmental contamination of wounds as a potential source
(5-8). Although some of the patients identified in this report had evidence
of bloodstream infections at the time of admission to military medical
facilities, whether the infections were acquired from environmental sources
in the field or during treatment at (or evacuation from) other military
medical facilities (such as field hospitals) is unknown.
Information on patients described in this report is being reviewed to
examine potential risk factors for _A. baumannii_ bloodstream infection. In
addition to exploring traditionally reported risk factors such as
antimicrobial exposure, ICU admission, vascular access, and mechanical
ventilation, this investigation will involve detailed reviews of geographic
locations where injuries occurred and reviews of the movement of injured
patients through treatment facilities. An environmental microbiology survey
of both indigenous soil samples and treatment facilities is also under way
to explore the potential contribution of environmental contamination to
this outbreak. Molecular analysis with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of
patient and environmental isolates will be performed to further
characterize the potential contribution of environmental contamination.
The bacterial isolates described in this report demonstrated
antimicrobial-resistance patterns similar to multidrug-resistant _A.
baumannii_ from ICUs in the United States and Europe (3,4). Data from the
NNIS system also indicate that resistance among Acinetobacter isolates is
increasing (CDC, unpublished data, 2004). The high level of antimicrobial
resistance is a challenge to clinicians treating _A. baumannii_ infections.
In some cases, the only effective antimicrobial agent is colistin
(polymyxin E); however, this agent is seldom used because of its high
toxicity (9). Use of colistin, possibly in combination with other agents,
might be effective; however, new agents active against multidrug-resistant
_A. baumannii_ are needed. Treatment of patients infected with _A.
baumannii_ is being monitored to determine factors predictive of success
and failure, to better understand the impact of antimicrobial resistance on
therapy, and to monitor the potential toxicities of treatment regimens that
include colistin.
Identification of colonized and infected patients, combined with
implementation of infection-control measures such as hand-hygiene and
contact-isolation precautions, might help prevent transmission of this
organism within medical facilities (1). Interventions recommended by
military medical officials have included 1) institution of active
surveillance of groin, axillary, and/or wound cultures for _A. baumannii_
for all patients; 2) use of contact precautions for colonized or infected
patients; and 3) increased availability and use of alcohol-based hand rubs.
Laboratory surveillance for _A. baumannii_ has been initiated at LRMC,
NNMC, WRAMC, and BAMC, and, as much as possible, at each forward-deployed
combat support hospital and medical treatment facility in Iraq, Kuwait, and
Afghanistan.
Clinicians who treat patients who have recently been hospitalized
(especially in ICUs) at the military hospitals described in this report
should be aware of the potential for colonization and infection with _A.
baumannii_. Additional information on _A. baumannii_ is available at
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/hip>.
Clinical management and wound-care guidelines have been developed to help
prevent and mitigate _A. baumannii_ infections in military treatment
facilities (10). Clinicians with specific questions about _A. baumannii_
among USA service members should contact the USA Army Center for Health
Promotion and Preventive Medicine, telephone 800-222-9698.
