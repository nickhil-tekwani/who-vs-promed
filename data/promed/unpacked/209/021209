Re:

tested more than 200 chipmunks and have never had a seropositive... -

Actually, during the original case control study in the Four Corners area in
1993 there were 8 Colorado chipmunks (_Tamius quadrivittatus_) and 1 Rock
squirrel (_Spermophilus variegatus_) that were found to be seropositive for
hantavirus. This of course, does not necessarily mean that they were
excreting virus, just exposed at some time in the past.

[Charlie Calisher, aka Mod.CHC, is away trapping chipmunks & other small
rodents in western Colorado for his hantavirus project this week & unable to
respond. However, his statement about no isolation of *virus* from
chipmunks still stands - Mod.JW]

A clarification might be in order here.
Although rodents do not "CARRY" the disease, they may not be asymptomatic
carriers [of the virus] as was once believed. Two recent articles make this
point:
J.Virol. 1999 V.73 pp.585-591 (SNV Pathogenesis in P.maniculatus)
Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1998 V.59 pp.58-65 (Pathogenesis of BCC in
Experimentally Infected S.hispidus)

P.S. One squirrel tested positive for antibody to Prospect Hill
[hantavirus] (though
1 in 97 animals is hardly convincing) (JID 1994 V.169 pp1271-80)
