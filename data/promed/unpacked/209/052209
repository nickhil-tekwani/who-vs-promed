Serum samples from birds and horses from 33 locations in Venezuela
were screened for immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies against [West
Nile virus (WNV)] antigen by ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay) and confirmed by plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT).
WNV was confirmed as the etiologic agent of infection in 5 adult
birds (3 _Turdus leucomelas_ [pale-breasted thrush], one _Coereba
flaveola_ [bananaquit], and one _Gallus gallus_ [domestic chicken]
with the earliest collection date in February 2006); virus
neutralization titers ranged from 80 to 320.
Antibody against flavivirus was detected by ELISA in 141 of 791
horses, and 34 (4.3 percent) were confirmed positive for WNV
infection by PRNT; viral titers >640 occurred in half of these
horses. The earliest collection date for a WNV-positive horse was
February 2004, and the most recent was May 2006. Specific
WNV-reactive equine serum samples were distributed in valley regions
(prevalence 1.3 percent), savannah grasslands (2.4 percent), the
western region of Zulia (0.4 percent) and the Central Lake Basin (0.3 percent).
Detection of WNV-infected resident birds provides strong evidence of
the establishment, rather than importation, of WNV in South America.
We hypothesize that ornithophilic mosquitoes (such as some _Culex_
spp.), which are present in the area in consistently high numbers,
acquired the virus through hematophagous feeding on recently
infected, migrating birds. Once introduced to local mosquitoes, virus
is amplified among susceptible resident birds fed upon by
ornithophilic mosquitoes. This pattern allows perpetuation and
subsequent establishment of virus in a continuous transmission cycle,
as opposed to infection of dead-end hosts, such as horses.
This is the 1st report of WNV infection in South American birds and
definitive establishment of the virus in South America.

Given the rapid spread of WNV in the USA and Canada, it is not
surprising that this virus has become established in South America as
well. It would be interesting to know if there is evidence for WNV
establishment in various ecological zones in Mexico and in Central
America, particularly those regularly visited by migrating birds from
north temperate areas. - Mod.TY]
