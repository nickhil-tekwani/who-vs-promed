The threat of an outbreak of infections due to the superbug known as KPC [_Klebsiella pneumoniae_ carbapenemase] at the Regional Hospital has put the city of Betim in the metropolitan region of Belo Horizonte [in the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais] on alert. According to the State Department of Health since the beginning of the year [2012], there have been 49 confirmed cases of KPC infection. Of these, 22 are in Betim Regional Hospital.

However, the Municipal Health Department of Betim denies the existence of an outbreak and disputes the figures released by the government. According to the Municipal Health Department, 6 patients are now hospitalized at the City Hospital with the diagnosis of KPC infection and 15 others with suspected KPC are under investigation. However, the Municipal Health Department could not say how many cases of KPC infection have been confirmed since the beginning of the year.

The State Health Department notified the Regional Hospital that it has 30 days to adopt the appropriate measures of control and prevention in the hospital environment with the goal of avoiding new KPC infections. After this period the Regional Hospital will receive a new visit to check if all control measures were adopted.

This year [2012], the number of confirmed KPC cases is almost 4 times greater than the sum of the last 2 years.

[Carbapenems are a class of beta-lactam antibiotics that includes ertapenem, doripenem, imipenem, and meropenem. Carbapenems historically have been antibiotics of last resort to treat many infections due to carbapenem-sensitive multidrug-resistant Gram negative bacilli. KPCs are a type of beta-lactamase that degrades and thereby confers resistance to carbapenem antibiotics. KPCs also hydrolyze all other beta-lactam antibiotics and consequently KPC-producing organisms are resistant to all beta-lactam antibiotics. KPC-producing organisms are also resistant to multiple other classes of antibiotics such as the aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones due to linked resistance genes.

KPCs (such as, KPC-1, -2, -3, -4, etc.) are plasmid-encoded enzymes first found in _K. pneumoniae_ isolates (hence, the name). Subsequently, KPCs have been found in other organisms, including _Escherichia coli_, _Serratia marcescens_, _Klebsiella oxytoca_, _Citrobacter freundii_, _Enterobacter_ spp., _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_, and _Salmonella enterica_. KPCs are now commonly encountered in the USA, and have also been reported worldwide in countries such as Israel, China, France, and Italy, as well as countries in Central (http://healthmap.org/news/kpc-bacteria-kills-50-panama) and South America, such as Colombia (1) and Brazil (2,3).

KPCs have been previously reported in the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais (2), as well as several other Brazilian states (2,3) (such as, Espirito Santo; Goias; Distrito Federal; Pernambuco; Rio de Janeiro; Rio Grande do Sul; and Santa Catarina).

Patients at risk of infections caused by KPC-producing microorganisms include those with prolonged hospitalization, particularly in intensive care units, those who are critically ill or immunocompromised, those exposed to invasive devices (such as ventilators or central venous catheters), and those receiving long courses of broad-spectrum antibiotics.

The US CDC has published guidelines for control of these organisms in health care facilities (Guidance for control of infections with carbapenem-resistant or carbapenemase-producing _Enterobacteriaceae_ in acute care facilities. MMWR 2009; 58(10): 256-60; available at http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5810a4.htm).
