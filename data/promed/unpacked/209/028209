Chicken burritos latest product added to meat recall
Thousands of chicken burritos made by a division of food conglomerate Tyson Foods Inc. have been
recalled, the latest instance of contamination by the deadly bacteria listeria.
The recall affects some 78 000 burritos supplied to American Airlines at the end of last year [1988,
according to a report in the Detroit Free Press. Chicago-based Culinary Foods Inc., a unit of Tyson
Foods, is a supplier to airlines and also makes foods for restaurants, totaling about 50 million meals per
year, the paper reported. Listeria bacteria was found in burritos sampled in Detroit, the paper said.
When ingested, the bacteria cause a disease called listeriosis that starts out resembling intestinal flu but
can lead to death. Listeriosis primarily affects unborn children, the very young, the elderly and people
with weakened immune systems. Healthy people are not normally sickened by it.
Officials from Culinary Foods and Arizona-based Tyson could not be reached for comment. According
to the Detroit paper, Culinary Foods is a major supplier to the airline industry, with its foods showing
up on almost all major carriers and foreign airlines as well. Dallas-based American Airlines stopped
serving all food from Culinary Foods about a month ago after concerns arose, the paper reported.
