Over 140 sheep died in the Macedonian village of Sopot [Kumanovo district?], reported the electronic edition of Faktor. The edition further pointed it was still unclear whether the reason has been a mysterious disease or something else.

According to the sheep's owner, the number of dead animals is 400. He said that the disease had infected the goats as well. [The sheep's owner] made an appeal to competent authorities to make an analysis to clarify what killed the animals.

[Confirmation of the mass mortality by official authorities is required and requested. In addition, further basic details on the event are in need, such as the flock's denominator figure, its age distribution (in the flock and among the dead), management system, breed, housing, vaccination history, etc. Have veterinarians been called upon/involved? If affirmative, their clinical, pathological, and epidemiological findings will be appreciated. - Mod.AS
