Kenya - Officials Battle Cholera Resistance to Drugs
The Kenyan ministry of health, currently battling the spread of cholera in
the Lake Victoria districts of Nyanza Province, has announced the immediate
stoppage of the use of tetracycline following the disease's resistance to
the drug. The drug has now been replaced with doxychloride [presumed to be
doxycycline - Mod.ES] , a more potent antibiotic. Nyanza provincial medical
officer, Dr. Richard Muga, said the lakeside districts of Nyanza remained
the most risky areas in the outbreak which has so far claimed over 15 lives.

Africa - Mozambique
Some 990 people have died of cholera in Mozambique since an epidemic
re-emerged after a two-month lull in the Southern African state last
September, official sources announced on Tuesday. Some 20,000 cases of the
disease have been recorded over the same period. Avertino Barreto, deputy
national director of health, told journalists that the northern provinces
of Cabo Delgado and Nampula had registered the largest number of cases --
more than half the total. Over the last five days the country registered a
total of 700 cases and 13 deaths, said Barreto.
