West Nile virus surveillance in France, 2001
--------------------------------------------
After the epizootic that occurred in the south of France (Petite Camargue
area) last year (1-3), a seasonal West Nile virus (WNV) surveillance
system was set up in June 2001 to include human, equine, avian, and
mosquito subsystems. The aim is to detect WNV activity in these host and
vector populations in order to take appropriate measures in terms of vector
control, communication, or enhanced surveillance. Different responses have
been planned depending on the results from each subsystem (birds, mosquito
pools, horses, or humans).
The objective of the human surveillance is to detect severe cases of WNV
infection. A suspect case is any person admitted to hospital residing in or
having travelled to the Camargue area (Herault, Bouches du Rhône, and le
Gard districts) since May and presenting with fever and neurological
manifestations of unknown aetiology (varying from headache to aseptic
meningitis or encephalitis). Hospital services notify suspect cases to
local health authorities and send specimens (serum or cerebrospinal fluid
[CSF) to one of the two collaborating specialised laboratories in
Marseilles and Paris. A case is confirmed according to one of the following
criteria:
· isolation of WNV or detection of WNV antigen or genomic sequences in
blood or CSF;
· detection of IgM antibody to WNV in CSF by enzyme linked immunosorbent
assay (EIA);
· a greater than fourfold serial change in plaque reduction neutralising
(PRNT) antibody titer to WNV in paired serum or CSF samples; or
· detection of both WNV-specific IgM (by EIA) and IgG (screened by EIA and
confirmed by PRNT) antibody in a single serum specimen.
To date, 11 suspected human cases have been notified, but none has been
confirmed. A horse presenting with clinical symptoms in July and 192
mosquito pools have tested negative for WNV. No seroconversions have been
detected among sentinel birds (wild ducks and poultry).
Since June 2001, no WNV activity has been detected in France. The
surveillance will be continued until October 2001, with an evaluation of
the surveillance system in November and December.
