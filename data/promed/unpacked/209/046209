Signs of an outbreak of citrus canker, a plant disease that threatens
Florida's multibillion-dollar fruit industry, have reached 10 commercial
groves in Miami-Dade County.
"It might have the possibility of wiping out the whole lime industry down
here," said Alcedes Acosta, owner of Acosta Farms in the southern part of
the county. Two of his groves are affected, and the trees may have to be
bulldozed and burned.
Eating infected fruit does not make people sick, but the bacteria make
citrus unsightly and unmarketable. There is also risk that other countries
would stop importing Florida fruits for fear their crops would catch the
disease.
More than 110 Florida Department of Agriculture inspectors were sent to
examine lime trees in the area for signs of the disease.
"We're hoping we caught it early enough to get it in check," said Ken
Bailey, director of the state Citrus Canker Eradication Project. "This is
one of the most serious problems that any citrus industry can face."
The area has more than 3,000 acres of lime trees, the only citrus grown
commercially in the area.
Since there is no cure for citrus canker, the main containment method is
removal of infected trees and nearby trees, and a quarantine to limit and
control distribution of fruit from infected areas.
Land where groves have been removed must lie bare for a minimum of two
years. Once groves are replanted, it takes at least four years before new
trees will produce fruit.
Last February, the bacteria was reported about 50 miles from the nearest
commercial grove. Authorities said then the highly contagious bacteria was
detected in the Miami area in 1995.

[Citrus canker can be eradicated, but it is a slow and methodical process.
About 500 square miles in Florida have been placed under strict quarantine.
Whereas all citrus trees within 50 feet of an infected tree were removed in
the eradication program, the spacing has now been increased to 125 feet,
and hopefully this will result in decreased spread and a better chance of
containing the disease. - Mod.DH
