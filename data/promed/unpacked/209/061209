The Epidemiology Directorate of La Pampa issued a health alert due to 3 cases of suspected psittacosis in General Pico, a town located 135 km [approx. 84mi] north of Santa Rosa. The individuals were hospitalized. Psittacosis, also known as parrot fever, is a disease caused by a bacterium called _Chlamydophila psittaci_. It is usually transmitted by inhaling the agent from dried droppings or secretions of infected birds.

Patients with psittacosis usually present fever, headache, rash, muscle pain, chills, and dry cough. Pneumonia may sometimes occur, and occasional complications include encephalitis, myocarditis, and thrombophlebitis. The disease can be treated effectively with antimicrobials. The disease is not normally transmitted from person to person.

Officials recommend that people who have been in contact with birds and show symptoms consult the nearest Health Center. In addition, buy birds in authorized premises, as long as they are allowed species and with veterinary advice. Lastly, they advised, "not to buy birds on the street from street vendors or through social networks, not to capture wild birds and avoid lifting birds from the ground that cannot fly and keep the cages clean, sanitize daily with 10% bleach and in well-ventilated places ".

[No information is given above regarding the epidemiology, the specific birds implicated as birds other than parrots can be involved, or the range of symptoms in those people affected.

Psittacosis, also known as ornithosis or parrot fever, is a human disease caused by the bacterium _Chlamydophila psittaci_. Classically associated with psittacine birds such as parakeets, parrots, and cockatiels, it may affect other avian species such as turkeys, ducks, pigeons, and pheasants. Human infection, in general, is caused by the inhalation of dust containing the bacterium, which is shed in large amounts in the feces and secretions of the infected birds. Illegally imported decorative birds that have not been screened and/or treated, can be a significant source of the pathogen.

The respiratory infection, usually diagnosed serologically, can be fatal if untreated. Although most diagnosed cases have direct exposure to birds, the infection may be acquired indirectly through the aerosolization of infective material in the grass or ground such as when mowing a lawn. Because of such outbreaks, protective equipment may be recommended for individuals in areas frequented by free-ranging birds if contact with birds and their droppings is likely when performing outdoor activities such as lawn mowing. People who are occupationally exposed to psittacosis include pet store workers, poultry farmers, poultry processing workers, and veterinarians. - Mod.LL
