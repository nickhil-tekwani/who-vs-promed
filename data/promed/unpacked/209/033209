A fire in a COVID-19 hospital ward in western India killed 18 patients as the country, grappling with the world's worst outbreak, stepped up a vaccination drive for all adults even though some states say they do not have enough jabs.

[The fire broke out in a COVID-19 ward on the ground floor and was extinguished within an hour, police said. The cause was being investigated.

It started around midnight in the intensive care ward of the Patel Welfare Hospital, a designated COVID-19 facility, in Bharuch city, 185 km (115 miles) north of the state's main commercial city, Ahmedabad.

"16 patients and 2 staff members have died in the fire. 12 of them died due to fire and smoke," said RV Chudasama, a superintendent of police in Bharuch. "Preliminary investigation shows the fire was caused because of a short circuit."

31 other patients at the Welfare Hospital were rescued by hospital workers and firefighters, and their condition was stable, said police officer BM Parmar. But Dushyant Patel, a state government official, said leakage from an oxygen cylinder in the intensive care unit started the blaze.

On 23 Apr 2021, a fire in an intensive care unit killed 13 COVID-19 patients in the Virar area on the outskirts of Mumbai.

India on Sat 1 May 2021 set yet another daily global record with 401 993 new coronavirus cases, taking its tally to more than 19.1 million. Another 3523 people died in the past 24 hours, raising the overall deaths to 211 853, according to the health ministry. Experts believe both figures are an undercount.

Modi held a cabinet meeting on Fri 30 Apr 2021 that discussed steps to save the country's crumbling health system by adding hospital beds, resolving issues in vaccine production, storage and transport of oxygen, and tackling the shortage of essential medicines.

Indian capital New Delhi will stay in lockdown for another week because of the surge in COVID cases, the city's chief minister said on Sat 1 May 2021.

"Lockdown in Delhi is being extended by one week," Arvind Kejriwal said on Twitter.

The current shutdown had been due to expire on Mon [3 May 2021], but the number of cases is still rising fast in the city of 20 million people.

Desperate COVID patients, meanwhile, continued to arrive at hospitals on Sat 1 May 2021 despite a shortage of beds.

The government on Sat 1 May 2021 shifted its faltering vaccination campaign into high gear by saying all adults -- people aged 18 and above -- were getting their shots.

Since January 2021, nearly 10 percent of Indians have received 1 dose, but only 1.5 percent have received both, even though India is one of the world's biggest producers of vaccines.

Some states have said they do not have enough doses for everyone. Even the continuing efforts to inoculate people above 45 is stuttering.

The state of Maharashtra said it will not be able to start the inoculation of younger people on Sat 1 May 2021. Satyender Jain, the health minister of Delhi state, said earlier this week the capital territory does not have enough doses to vaccinate people aged between 18 and 44.

Australian residents and citizens who have been in India will be banned from entering Australia as of Mon 3 May 2021, and those who disobey will face fines and jail, government officials said. The temporary emergency determination, issued late on Fri 30 Apr 2021, is the 1st time Australia has made it a criminal offence for its citizens to return home.

The United States, meanwhile, joined the growing list of countries restricting travel from India, the White House said, citing a devastating rise in COVID-19 cases and the emergence of potentially dangerous variants of the coronavirus.

US President Joe Biden spoke on Mon [26 Apr 2021] with Modi about the growing health crisis and pledged to immediately send assistance. This week, the US began delivering therapeutics, rapid virus tests, and oxygen to India, along with some materials needed for India to boost its domestic production of COVID-19 vaccines.

Additionally, a team of public health experts was expected to be on the ground soon to help Indian health officials move to slow the spread of the virus.

Other nations have also sent assistance, and the Indian air force airlifted oxygen containers from Singapore, Dubai, and Thailand.

[The travel restrictions are unfortunate, as they add to the hardship for some families, but with 400 000 cases a day and showing little sign of abating, the virus is very difficult to contain, and isolating the entire country is one approach. - Mod.LK]

Ref. Mwananyanda L, Gill C J, MacLeod W, et al. Covid-19 deaths in Africa: prospective systematic postmortem surveillance study BMJ 2021; 372 :n334 doi:10.1136/bmj.n334

Abstract
Objective. To directly measure the fatal impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) in an urban African population.

Design. Prospective systematic postmortem surveillance study.

Setting. Zambia's largest tertiary care referral hospital.

Participants. Deceased people of all ages at the University Teaching Hospital morgue in Lusaka, Zambia, enrolled within 48 hours of death.

Main outcome measure. Postmortem nasopharyngeal swabs were tested via reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Deaths were stratified by Covid-19 status, location, age, sex, and underlying risk factors.

Results. 372 participants were enrolled between June and September 2020; PCR results were available for 364 (97.8%). SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 58/364 (15.9%) according to the recommended cycle threshold value of less than 40 and in 70/364 (19.2%) when expanded to any level of PCR detection. The median age at death among people with a positive test for SARS-CoV-2 was 48 (interquartile range 36-72) years, and 69% (n=48) were male. Most deaths in people with Covid-19 (51/70; 73%) occurred in the community; none had been tested for SARS-CoV-2 before death. Among the 19/70 people who died in hospital, 6 were tested before death. Among the 52/70 people with data on symptoms, 44/52 had typical symptoms of Covid-19 (cough, fever, shortness of breath), of whom only 5 were tested before death. Covid-19 was identified in 7 children, only one of whom had been tested before death. The proportion of deaths with Covid-19 increased with age, but 76% (n=53) of people who died were aged under 60 years. The 5 most common comorbidities among people who died with Covid-19 were tuberculosis (22; 31%), hypertension (19; 27%), HIV/AIDS (16; 23%), alcohol misuse (12; 17%), and diabetes (9; 13%).

Conclusions. Contrary to expectations, deaths with Covid-19 were common in Lusaka. Most occurred in the community, where testing capacity is lacking. However, few people who died at facilities were tested, despite presenting with typical symptoms of Covid-19. Therefore, cases of Covid-19 were under-reported because testing was rarely done, not because Covid-19 was rare. If these data are generalizable, the impact of Covid-19 in Africa has been vastly underestimated.

Discussion
In this systematic surveillance study in Lusaka, Zambia, we observed a surprisingly high prevalence of mortality related to Covid-19. Conservatively, 15% of all participants who died between June and September 2020 had Covid-19 during this period. If we assume that lower intensity PCR results (that is, cycle threshold 40-45) reflect waning viral loads and are not false positives, then the prevalence of Covid-19 approached 20% of all deaths. Only a minority of the deceased had been tested for SARS-CoV-2 before death.

Several points merit further discussion:

1st, most deaths occurred in the community and outside of medical care. Among the majority of people who died in the community, none had been tested for Covid-19 before death.

2nd, testing was rarely conducted among the minority of deaths that occurred in a facility.

3rd, deaths with Covid-19 occurred quite evenly across the age spectrum, not just among older people. Most deaths were in people aged 20-59 years. This pattern is distinct from that described in the US, the EU, and China; it is more typical of the death by age distributions and population age structures common in African countries.

4th, 10% (7/70) of the deaths with Covid-19 were in children, including 3 infants. Among the younger children, gastrointestinal rather than respiratory complaints predominated, which may be a factor explaining why only one had been tested for Covid-19 before death.

5th, we identified a high frequency of novel potential underlying risk factors that may be more specific to Africa. Notably, tuberculosis, malnutrition, and HIV/AIDS were very common in this setting but are comparatively uncommon in the US or Europe.

Policy implications.
Across the continent, as of 30 Oct 2020, the Africa Centers for Disease Control reported a cumulative total of 21 million tests for SARS-CoV-2, of which around 60% came from only 5 of Africa's 54 countries: South Africa, Morocco, Egypt, Kenya, and Ethiopia. By contrast, the US, a country with less than 1/3rd the population of Africa, has conducted more than 192 million tests, for a per capita rate nearly 30 times higher. Given these realities, an "absence of evidence" documenting the impact of Covid-19 in Africa could easily be misconstrued as "evidence of absence."

[There have been comparatively few large postmortem COVID series published, especially from low income and lower-middle income countries in Africa and Asia. The above study not only helps fill this gap, but also helps answer a question that has been posed by the popular writer Siddhartha Mukherjee (Ref.1) and others; namely, why are reported death rates from COVID in many poorer countries lower than those from richer nations? This Zambia study provides a stark answer: most COVID deaths, in Lusaka at least, occurred in the community and outside of medical care, and very few of them were tested for COVID pre-mortem.

[3] Spike protein
Date: Fri 30 Apr 2021
Source: Salk News [abridged, edited]

Scientists have known for a while that SARS-CoV-2's distinctive "spike" proteins help the virus infect its host by latching onto healthy cells. Now, a major new study shows that they also play a key role in the disease itself.

The paper, published on 30 Apr 2021, in Circulation Research, also shows conclusively that COVID-19 is a vascular disease, demonstrating exactly how the SARS-CoV-2 virus damages and attacks the vascular system on a cellular level. The findings help explain COVID-19's wide variety of seemingly unconnected complications and could open the door for new research into more effective therapies.

Spike protein causes increased mitochondrial fragmentation in vascular cells. "A lot of people think of it as a respiratory disease, but it's really a vascular disease," says Assistant Research Professor Uri Manor, who is co-senior author of the study. "That could explain why some people have strokes, and why some people have issues in other parts of the body. The commonality between them is that they all have vascular underpinnings."

Salk researchers collaborated with scientists at the University of California San Diego on the paper, including co-1st author Jiao Zhang and co-senior author John Shyy, among others.

While the findings themselves aren't entirely a surprise, the paper provides clear confirmation and a detailed explanation of the mechanism through which the protein damages vascular cells for the 1st time. There's been a growing consensus that SARS-CoV-2 affects the vascular system, but exactly how it did so was not understood. Similarly, scientists studying other coronaviruses have long suspected that the spike protein contributed to damaging vascular endothelial cells, but this is the 1st time the process has been documented.

In the new study, the researchers created a "pseudovirus" that was surrounded by the SARS-CoV-2 classic crown of spike proteins but did not contain any actual virus. Exposure to this pseudovirus resulted in damage to the lungs and arteries of an animal model, proving that the spike protein alone was enough to cause disease. Tissue samples showed inflammation in endothelial cells lining the pulmonary artery walls.

The team then replicated this process in the lab, exposing healthy endothelial cells (which line arteries) to the spike protein. They showed that the spike protein damaged the cells by binding ACE2. This binding disrupted ACE2's molecular signaling to mitochondria (organelles that generate energy for cells), causing the mitochondria to become damaged and fragmented.

Previous studies have shown a similar effect when cells were exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, but this is the 1st study to show that the damage occurs when cells are exposed to the spike protein on its own.

"If you remove the replicating capabilities of the virus, it still has a major damaging effect on the vascular cells, simply by virtue of its ability to bind to this ACE2 receptor, the S protein receptor, now famous thanks to COVID," Manor explains. "Further studies with mutant spike proteins will also provide new insight towards the infectivity and severity of mutant SARS CoV-2 viruses."

The researchers next hope to take a closer look at the mechanism by which the disrupted ACE2 protein damages mitochondria and causes them to change shape.

There are numerous publications that address the role of vascular injury and pathology associated with COVID-19 infection, but this report is the 1st to demonstrate that damage occurs when cells are exposed only to the spike protein, through binding to the ACE-2 receptor. - Mod.LK]

[Although the above study shows that the spike protein alone causes endothelial cell damage in vitro, it seems difficult to extrapolate that spike protein fragments alone, in the absence of circulating intact SARS-CoV-2 virions, are clinically significant. Clinical studies of COVID patients indicate that major thrombotic events (pulmonary, coronary, cerebral) occur mainly during the viremic phase, when there is intact virus. Unlike the viral RNA, the viral proteins (including the spike protein) are comparatively rapidly degraded and cleared (by proteasomes and other mechanisms). This helps explain why SARS-CoV-2 rapid antigen tests (including those based on the spike protein, not just the nucleocapsid protein) turn negative far sooner in the course of the disease than do SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests. -Mod.LXL]
