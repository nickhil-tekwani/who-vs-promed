The fight against anthrax, brucellosis and foot and mouth disease should be carried out using modern standards and products. Then the effect will be higher. At the moment, we need special vehicles, equipped with a GPS-navigator for the transport and storage of drugs, as well as refrigeration equipment with temperature indicator and an audible signal to alert about irregularities in the drugs storage conditions - said Askar Zhakupbaev, the head of the regional veterinary management. The discussion took place at a special meeting held yesterday [Wed 25 Jan 2017] in Ust-Kamenogorsk under the chairmanship of deputy akim Duysengazy Mussina.

He also said that such vehicles are to be in service with local veterinarians during this year [2017]. The Head veterinarian noted that the total number of outbreaks of highly dangerous animal diseases decreased by 36 in 2016. While in 2015 there were 55 outbreaks, their number dropped to 19 during the last year [2016]. However, an outbreak of anthrax occurred in Zharma area. The incidence of human brucellosis decreased by 9 cases compared to 2015. This is facilitated by, in his words, a permanent prevention and explanatory work with the population.

"We believe that on the whole, the epizootic situation in the region is stable. However, efforts should be continued... There is need to attract young professionals to the villages, providing them with housing and other necessities to solve the problem of shortage of qualified personnel in rural counties - summed [deputy akim] Duysengazy Musin.

[According to Kazakhstan's reporting to the OIE, the last FMD event there took place in June 2013 (East Kazakhstan, FMDV serotype A).
In view of the above media item, which addresses "fighting against FMD" (and the endemic diseases anthrax and brucellosis), the FMD situation in East Kazakhstan deserves to be reconfirmed. FMD is known to be circulating in Kazakhstan's neighbors on the east/south east, China and (east, though at some distance; see map) Mongolia. The virus was suspected to be circulating in at least one of its southern neighbours (Kyrghizstan; last officially reported in 2014).

Ust-Kamenogorsk (also known as Oskemen) is a city of East Kazakhstan oblast (region) of Kazakhstan. See map at http://tinyurl.com/jqmk95z. - Mod.AS
