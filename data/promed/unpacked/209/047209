Rats and tungro virus have affected 405 hectares [1000 acres] of rice
land in the province of Aklan. The agriculture department and the
town officials have already put in place measures to contain the pest
infestation and crop disease. The report on Aklan's pest infestation
and crop disease was furnished by Department of Agriculture's [DA]
Larry Nacionales to DA secretary Arthur Yap. However, the press
report provided to TNT did not identify the affected rice growing
municipalities in the province.

The DA will provide training to help the farmers adopt better pest
management practices which are deemed effective against the spread of
pests and crop diseases. The farmers are urged to seek the help of
municipal agriculture officers. Yap believes the massive information
campaign, farmers' field schools, and palay [unmilled rice] check
program could effectively minimize the effects of the infestation.
The DA will [also] train the farmers on how to program their planting
and harvest schedule. Better seed varieties will be distributed in
the next planting season to control the infestation.

[Tungro is one of the most damaging rice diseases in South East Asia.
Yield losses of up to 100 percent have been reported, and the disease
is spreading in the region. It is a co-infection involving _Rice
tungro bacilliform virus_ (RTBV; genus _Tungrovirus_, family
_Caulimoviridae_) and _Rice tungro spherical virus_ (RTSV; genus
_Waikavirus_, family _Sequiviridae_). More than one genotype of each
virus may exist in the same plant.

Symptoms include leaf discolouration, stunting, reduced tillering,
and reduced grain production. All growth stages of rice are
susceptible. Tungro is transmitted by leafhoppers, the most efficient
vector being the green leafhopper _Nephotettix virescens_. RTBV
cannot be transmitted unless RTSV is present. Infectious vector
insects can spread the viruses over long distances. The disease is
not seed transmitted.

Disease management includes vector control, crop rotation and other
cultural practices, as well as the use of rice varieties resistant to
the vectors, the viruses, or both. Vector adaptation on leafhopper
resistant varieties has been a problem, and virus resistant varieties
are at present considered the most economical way of tungro control.
However, the presence of multiple viral genotypes in a single
location suggests an unstable virus population which poses a
challenge to achieving durable crop resistance.
