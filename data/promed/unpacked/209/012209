Your posting Salmonellosis, serotype Typhimurium U292 - Denmark: pork
(archive no. 20090306.0935) contains inaccurate information in the
title. The 2 salmonellosis outbreaks described were not caused by
_Salmonella enterica_ serotype Typhimurium U292 but 2 other phage
types: U288 and U312. The outbreaks are mentioned in the Danish
weekly epidemiological bulletin from Statens Serum Institut EPI-NYT
(<http://www.ssi.dk/sw63917.asp> for the Danish version; an English
translation EPI-NEWS will be posted later this week). It is from our
report in EPI-NYT that the press picked it up.

The translation (in draft) that will be posted in EPI-NEWS follows:

"Two _Salmonella_ outbreaks
---------------------------
Denmark has recently seen 2 separate, but comparable salmonella outbreaks.

_Salmonella_ Typhimurium U288
-----------------------------
In October-November 2008, 37 cases of _S._ Typhimurium phage type
U288 with the same DNA profile were detected using the MLVA [MLVA
(Multiple Loci VNTR (variable number of tandem repeats) Analysis]
typing method. The majority of the cases lived in Zealand. The
outbreak strain was found in a swine farm and in pork and a range of
pork products (including raw pork sausage) from several companies,
which all formed part of the same chain of delivery. 4 patients died.
It is uncertain to which extent the _Salmonella_ infections caused
these deaths as the deceased were all above the age of 75 years and
had underlying diseases. Part of the contaminated pork had been
exported to Sweden and sold in shops situated near the Norwegian
border. 10 cases were verified in Norway and 2 in Sweden.

_Salmonella_ Typhimurium U312
-----------------------------
Since December 2008, a total of 42 cases of _S._ Typhimurium phage
type U312 have so far been registered. This outbreak will probably be
traced back to a single slaughterhouse in Jutland and to the swine
farms supplying it. The source of the outbreak may be fresh pork as
well as processed pork products. This hypothesis is supported by
interviews with the affected patients. The slaughterhouse is being
monitored by the Danish Food Authorities and the outbreak is now receding.

Commentary
----------
The 2 _S._ Typhimurium outbreaks are similar in that they were both
caused by Danish pork. In both outbreaks, pork products were traced
back to specific swine farms and slaughterhouses, processing, or
refinement plants. The findings were supported by typing results. The
_S._ Typhimurium U288 outbreak was extraordinary as it spread to
other Scandinavian countries. This stresses the importance of Nordic
cooperation.

It is estimated that no direct link exists between the 2 outbreaks
described above and the major outbreak of _S._ Typhimurium U292,
described in EPI-NEWS 49/08, which now counts more than 1280 cases.
The number of new weekly cases in this outbreak has dropped
considerably in comparison with the weekly counts during the summer
and autumn of 2008.

[Department of Epidemiology on behalf of the Joint Outbreak Group]"

As seen in this text, the outbreaks are distinct from the huge
outbreak of _Salmonella_ Typhimurium U292. Nonetheless, taken
together, there is cause for concern, since the lead hypothesis as
regards the source of the U292 outbreak is that the culprit is pork
or products made from pork. In total, the number of verified
_Salmonella_ Typhimurium cases rose from 352 cases in 2007 to a
record of 2002 in 2008; this was primarily due to the U292 outbreak,
but a number of other outbreaks (including the 2 mentioned above)
contributed as well. All in all, Danish salmonella cases increased
from 1659 in 2007 to 3655 in 2008.

[The error regarding the specific _S._ Typhimurium phage type was
made by this moderator in assuming that these outbreaks were indeed
due to the same phage type. ProMED-mail thanks Dr Moelbak for the correction.
