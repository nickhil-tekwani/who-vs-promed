The 1st cases of acquired equine polyneuropathy (AEP) have been confirmed in Icelandic horses. The disease 1st appeared in Scandinavia around 25 years ago, but has only now been confirmed in Iceland. Despite extensive research, its cause is unknown.

AEP is not a contagious disease, and there is no evidence that it is hereditary, according to a press release from the Icelandic Food and Veterinary Authority (MAST). The disease is believed to be linked to hay, as the horses that have been diagnosed with the illness were all fed with the same hay from the same field. Not all horses that [ate] the hay in question got sick, however, suggesting that there are other factors involved.

Polyneuropathy is damage or disease affecting peripheral nerves in roughly the same areas on both sides of the body. The main symptoms of AEP are muscle weakness in the back of the body, causing the horses' hind legs to collapse now and then onto their pasterns. Horses with the disease exhibit full consciousness, good appetite, and mostly normal behaviour.

AEP usually arises in horses between late winter and the month of May, and very few cases are reported outside of that time period. In Norway, Sweden, and Finland, it is common for there to be many cases at each farm where the disease is found, and diagnoses are usually bound to a specific region. AEP most often arises in young horses, although not foals. The majority of horses that show symptoms of AEP are cured with rest and new feed. However, according to statistics from Norway and Sweden, up to 30% of animals who contract the disease must be put down.

The 1st confirmed cases in Iceland were diagnosed at a large horse farm in northwest Iceland. Detectable symptoms have been observed in 22 horses at the farm, all between the ages of 2 and 7 years. Of these horses, 7 have been put down and one was found dead. There are possibly more young horses on the farm with mild symptoms.

AEP has not been found on any other farms in the country, and it can be assumed that the risk of discovering more cases this year [2019] is low, as most young horses are now grazing. There is a risk, however, that the disease will arise elsewhere in the future, as the conditions that cause it have now clearly appeared in Iceland.

As the disease is new to the country, MAST requests notification of all cases where AEP is suspected or confirmed. Farmers needing further information can contact Sigriour Bjornsdottir at <sigridur.bjornsdottir@mast.is> or +354-893-0824.

[AEP is an equine disease characterised by bilateral pelvic limb knuckling, observed, before its recent discovery in Iceland, in Sweden, Norway and Finland, and sometimes referred to as Scandinavian knuckling syndrome. A detailed description from Norway and Sweden, published in 2012, is presented in Ref. 1. Its Conclusions section follows:

"Acquired equine polyneuropathy, an emerging peripheral neurological disease in horses, is characterised by pelvic limb knuckling without other signs of general disease. Signs progressed to recumbency in one-third of the cases, which led to euthanasia. Surviving horses returned to health and work after months of rest. Cases clustered in farms during winter/spring season and all cases and controls were fed wrapped forage. Horses of a younger age were more often affected than older horses, but tended to recover more rapidly. A forage-related aetiology for this disease is a possibility, but has not been proven. Other management risk factors for cases within affected stables were not identified."

A later (2017) report addressed the histopathological changes (Ref. 2). Its abstract follows:

"Acquired equine polyneuropathy (AEP), formerly also known as Scandinavian knuckling syndrome, is one of the most prevalent polyneuropathies in equids in Norway and Sweden, with more than 400 cases registered since 1st observations in 1995. Despite geographical clustering and an association to forage feeding, its aetiology remains unknown. Clinically AEP is characterized by knuckling due to dysfunction of metatarsophalangeal extensor muscles. This neuropathological study aimed to gain further insights in the pathobiology of AEP and its underlying aetiopathogenesis. We thereby confirmed that all affected horses suffered from similar large fibre neuropathy, exhibiting conspicuous Schwann cell inclusions in most samples, suggestive of a primary disruption of Schwann cell metabolism leading to inclusion body schwannopathy with secondary inflammatory changes. The degree of nerve pathology was not predictive of clinical outcome." - Mod.AS
