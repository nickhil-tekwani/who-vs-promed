Psittacosis is the clinical disease in humans caused by _Chlamydia
psittaci_.
Chlamydiosis is the clinical disease in birds caused by [an avian
strain of _Chlamydia psittaci_.
Many birds can carry _Chlamydia psittaci_ and not have the clinical
disease. In 1994, one the leading avian pathologists in the US told me
only about 15 percent or less of wild birds carried _Chlamydia
psittaci_ in the USA. [However, surveys since then have demonstrated
that most birds carry _C. psittaci_. - Mod.TG. An avian veterinarian
in Australia in 1993 told me approximately 90 percent of the wild
birds in Australia carried _Chlamydia psittaci_.

humans (psittacosis) and pet birds (avian chlamydiosis), 2000. Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention.
Psittacosis -- also known as parrot fever and ornithosis -- is spread
by a bacterial infection of birds causing severe pneumonia and other
serious health problems among humans. From 1988 through 1998, 813
cases of psittacosis (infection with _Chlamydia psittaci_) were
reported to CDC, and most resulted from exposure to infected pet
birds, usually cockatiels, parakeets, parrots, and macaws.
In birds, _C. psittaci_ infection is referred to as avian chlamydiosis
(AC). [Man is also exposed to air- or dust-borne organisms when
infected birds are processed at dressing plants or confined in
breeding aviaries, lofts, or wholesale or retail outlets. -
Mod.TG
Infected birds shed the bacteria through feces and nasal discharges,
and humans become infected from exposure to these materials. This
compendium provides information about psittacosis and AC to public
health officials, physicians, veterinarians, the pet bird industry,
and others concerned about controlling these diseases and protecting
public health. The recommendations in this compendium provide
standardized procedures for controlling AC in birds, a vital step to
protecting human health.

[Thanks to Dr. Davis for reminding us of the differences in the
terminology
of the disease between humans and avians. However, a title such as
"Psittacosis & avian chlamydiosis - USA (California) (02)" becomes
unwieldy! - Mods.TG & JW
