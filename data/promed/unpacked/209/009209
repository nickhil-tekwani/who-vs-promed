A doctor in Haiti's capital, Port-au-Prince, says she has seen cases of
suspected cholera, sparking fears that the epidemic has spread to the city.
Dr Kara Gibson of the American charity Samaritan's Purse told the BBC that
some people in the city's biggest slum have symptoms of the disease.

The country's health ministry says 501 have died from the disease so far.
But health workers say the figure could be higher as many areas have been
cut off by flooding after hurricane Tomas. More than 7000 people have been
infected across the country, according to the ministry.

Haitian officials have not confirmed the presence of cholera in the city,
but there has been concern that the disease is spreading.

The BBC's Laura Trevelyan says diarrhoea is common in the country, because
so many live in cramped and unhygienic conditions, often without toilets.
But some patients in the slum of Cite Soleil, in Port-au-Prince, have a
more severe form of watery diarrhoea -- which Dr Gibson says appears to be
cholera. She says there are concerns that the disease will now spread even
faster, despite humanitarian efforts to stem it.

"Now that it is in Cite Soleil, you can expect to see it just explode," Dr
Gibson told the BBC. "The hospital in that area is already at capacity. It
is maxed out in a manner of a day and there is just no other site," she says.

Local authorities and relief agencies have been attempting to get clean
drinking water to those areas worse affected by hurricane Tomas, which
caused flooding and left 8 people dead.

There was flooding in Leogane, Les Cayes, Jacmel, and Gonaives, while many
mountain towns have been cut off by flooded roads and landslides. Although
the hurricane passed without destroying the tented camps in and around the
capital, which house about 1.3 million survivors of January's [2010]
earthquake, there were fears over the increased risk of cholera.

Because of ongoing evidence of cholera being spread by infected people
along the coastal highway that connects the St Marc/Artibonite epicenter of
the cholera epidemic with Arcahaie, Lafito, and Cite Soleil that repeated
introduction of cholera to Cite Soleil would continue likely undetected
until a cluster of cases emerged. Today [7 Nov 2010], Samaritan's Purse
announced discovery of 47 cases with critically ill children at a clinic in
Cite Soleil. It has long been feared that transmission of cholera in Cite
Soleil, given the degree of indigenous poverty, would represent a nearly
uncontrollable situation. Needless to say, it demands the immediate
attention of public health given the implied direct threat to Port-au-Prince.

[3] Spread further north

Officials in Haiti tell ABC News that cholera is spreading to the north.
Ted Steinhauer is directing Medical Teams International's operations in
Haiti and spoke with ABC News from a hospital in the tiny town of Gros
Morne, where he said there are 600 cholera patients. He said there are
likely thousands more in the mountainous north and north west.

Steinhauer said the disease has entered the water supply. It first bloomed
last month [October 2010] in the Artibonite valley, a big rice farming
area. The rice workers carried it up to the mountains where they live.
There is little sanitation up there and no latrines, so they defecate in
creeks and streams. The flooding from hurricane Tomas just spread
everything out.

Medical teams are still assessing the situation, and the UN said it could
be 4 days before they can confirm the new outbreak. They said there is
"severe diarrhea" in several parts of the country.

[4] Baseline sanitary conditions

A colorful cholera prevention poster in Haiti has images of smiling people
getting water from a tap, a man using a sturdy latrine, and people walking
a sick boy to a health center. But these vital tools for fighting the
infectious bacterial disease are absent in most communities, such as the
village of Deslandes in the Petite Riviere d'Artibonite District.

Here, there is one well for 600 people that rarely functions, the village
has no toilets and reaching the nearest health center requires crossing a
river. Most people use the Artibonite River, thought to be the source of
the epidemic, as their primary source of drinking, bathing, and laundry water.

It has been decades since Haiti last saw cholera, but with the country's
abysmal water and sanitation conditions diarrhoeal disease is common. "The
lack of water and sanitation infrastructure in Haiti made it very difficult
to imagine we would not have a major diarrhea outbreak as a consequence of
the earthquake," said Joia Mukherjee, chief medical officer with Partners
in Health (PIH), a Boston-based NGO which has worked in Haiti for over 20
years.

Haiti is one of the few countries in the world where sanitation coverage
for urban dwellers decreased between 1990 and 2006, according to the UN
Children's Fund (UNICEF) and World Health Organization. Rural areas like
Deslandes are badly off as well. Open defecation is the rule, a practice
that is all the more dangerous when cholera is present. Less than 40 per
cent of Haitians have access to toilets, according to UNICEF-Haiti. "When
people get sick they relieve themselves in the woods like all of us, a
Deslandes resident told IRIN. [Once they are too weak] and cannot stand any
more, they stay at home and their whole body gets covered in diarrhea."

He said people scrub their homes with river water. NGOs have brought bleach
and other supplies to nearby villages but Deslandes is isolated and access
difficult, noted local pastor Solomon Tomas.

"People talk a lot about prevention," PIH's Mukherjee told IRIN. "But you
have prevention [messages] against a backdrop of extreme deprivation. It is
tough for people to avail themselves of the tools to prevent infection."

If prevention is difficult in places like Deslandes, so is treatment. While
some 80 per cent of cholera cases can be successfully treated with oral
rehydration salts, if they are not on hand one must get to a health post.
"There is a health centre in [the town of] La Chapelle but it can't deal
with the number of people who are sick," the pastor said. "It can take 2 or
3 hours to get to the hospital."

PIH and 3 other institutions in 2008 published a report about the
widespread lack of access to clean water in Haiti. This lack, the report
said, "ranks as one of Haiti's most significant obstacles when it comes to
meeting basic human rights standards. Historical legacies of inequality,
disempowered or corrupt governance, and persistent levels of extreme
poverty have all contributed to the Haitian government's systemic inability
to deliver clean water to its people."
