Between 1 Jan & 4 Aug 2006, 242 laboratory-confirmed cases [of Crimean-Congo
hemorrhagic fever (CCHF)], including 20 deaths (case-fatality rate (CFR) 8
percent), were reported by the Ministry of Health of Turkey. These figures
correspond to 92 newly reported cases & 9 deaths since the last update as of
30 Jun 2006.
One of the newly reported fatal cases was a health care worker who acquired
the infection while treating CCHF cases in Corum province.

It is hoped that the tragic death of the health care worker will
alert all those attending suspected CCHF cases to take the appropriate
measures needed to avoid exposure to infected patients.
CCHF patients present a risk of nosocomial transmission in the hospital,
particularly in the early stages of their infection when this disease is not
yet diagnosed. Suspected or diagnosed CCHF patients should be isolated and
barrier nursing practices carried out. Blood or tissue taken for diagnostic
tests should be handled with appropriate precautions. The greatest risk is
inadvertent self-inoculation through needle sticks or during surgical
procedures. Needles and other wastes should be decontaminated prior to
disposal. - Mod.TY]
