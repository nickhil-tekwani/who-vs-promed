Norwalk virus outbreak on fourth cruise ship; the P & O Oceana
--------------------------------------------------------------
More than 100 passengers aboard a luxury cruise liner sailing in the
Caribbean are battling a nasty intestinal virus, US disease investigators
reported last night, marking the fourth ship in a month to experience an
outbreak of an illness that ruins vacations and leaves stomachs churning.
Passengers on the Oceana began reporting classic symptoms of Norwalk virus
infection -- vomiting, diarrhea, and nausea -- within hours of the ship
setting sail on Friday from Port Everglades in Fort Lauderdale, according
to the chief of the vessel sanitation program at the US Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC). By last night, CDC was preparing to dispatch
a rapid response team to investigate the outbreak on the ship, which was
carrying about 2000 passengers.
Although the precise cause of the illness has not been confirmed, both CDC
investigators and executives at the company that operates the Oceana, P&O
Cruises of London, say they strongly suspect Norwalk virus, a [virus] that
has been afflicting passengers aboard cruise ships and in hospitals,
schools, and nursing homes in North America and the United Kingdom. The
virus rarely results in serious health complications, but leaves an
estimated 181 000 people a year in the United States with significant
discomfort for 2 to 3 days.
Disease specialists and ship inspectors who investigated earlier outbreaks
aboard cruise vessels found no evidence that the unusual rash of illnesses
is attributable to food or water tainted through processing or preparation.
Instead, investigators said yesterday all information points to the virus
being carried aboard the ships by passengers or crew.
Records at CDC, which conducts ship sanitation inspections, show that the
most recent review of the Oceana happened the same day the ship left on its
Caribbean voyage. It received a score of 95 out of a possible 100. While
television commercials tout cruise vessels as "fun ships", islands of
escape from the rigors of daily life, some travelers can't escape viruses
such as Norwalk virus that spread with speed and ease in close quarters.
That scenario unfolded aboard 3 other ships that sailed within the past
month from Florida ports: Carnival's Fascination, Holland America's
Amsterdam, and Disney's Magic. Including the latest outbreak aboard the
Oceana, about 1300 passengers have been stricken with symptoms believed to
be caused by Norwalk virus. Dr Megan Murray, a Harvard School of Public
Health epidemiologist, traveled last week to Fort Lauderdale to investigate
the outbreak aboard the Amsterdam at the behest of the ship's owner. In
reviewing the pattern of illness aboard the ship, Murray concluded that
person-to-person infection was to blame for the outbreak rather than a
single source of contamination.
"There's a lot of Norwalk virus this year," Murray said. "It's been
devastating Britain and Ireland -- hospital wards have closed down, for
instance." And its appearance this year aboard cruise ships in Alaska and
during the summer on Canadian rail lines in British Columbia underscores a
hazard of human mobility, Murray said. "It is a feature of how we travel
now and how society is organized," Murray said. "It's the tendency for us
to aggregate in close spaces that allows this kind of transmission to take
place."
