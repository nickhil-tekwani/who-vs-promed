The laboratory of the National Center for Tropical Diseases (CENTROP) has confirmed that a 10-year-old girl who was in the intensive care unit had [a] hantavirus [infection], according to information from the head of the San Juan de Dios Regional Hospital, Vivian Torrez.

The patient, who is from the La Cueva community, Entre Rios municipality, Torrez is the same person who was admitted and later released. "The child was in intensive therapy for several days under the care of medical and paramedical personnel who were supervising the progress of her health," she explained.

The health official recalled that the girl arrived at the hospital as a suspected hantavirus [infection case], so that samples were taken, and, later, CENTROP confirmed the [etiology] of the disease.

[The numbers of cases of hantavirus infection in Tarija department continue to increase. The previously reported 2015 cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) that occurred in Tarija department were confirmed in Oruro department, and this latest case was confirmed in CENTROP. As noted in the previous comments, earlier cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome have been reported from tropical, lowland areas of Bolivia, including 7 cases in Tarija during 2014. The specific hantaviruses involved in these or previous cases for the last 2 years (2013, 2014) in Bolivia are not given.

In the lowland Amazon Basin of Bolivia, the possible hantavirus, its rodent hosts that might be involved in these hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) cases, with their images, include:
- Laguna Negra virus (_Calomys laucha_ http://www.faunaparaguay.com/images/Calomys%20laucha%20enciso%2031aug2011.jpg and _C. callosus_ https://eee.uci.edu/clients/bjbecker/PlaguesandPeople/Calomyscallosusb.jpg);
- Bermejo (Chaco rice rat _Oligoryzomys chacoensis_ http://www.faunaparaguay.com/oligorizomyschacoensis.html);
- Oran (_O. longicaudatus_ http://calphotos.berkeley.edu/imgs/512x768/0000_0000/0711/1203.jpeg).

Since some of these cases occurred in the Bermejo municipality, perhaps Bermejo virus was responsible for at least some of these cases of HPS.
