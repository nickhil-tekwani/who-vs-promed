An outbreak of hepatitis A has affected nearly 100 children from zero to 12 years of age, in the "El Colegio" community, Tarimbaro Municipality, Michoacan, Mexico. This occurrence has generated justified anxiety in El Colegio inhabitants.

A woman who has 2 nieces with hepatitis described the current situation in the community. "Many cases have been observed; my 2 nieces acquired this disease, and they have just been sent back to school; some other cases occurred in the kindergarten; more than 20 children are affected as far as I know, and many more are being reported; even a baby was said to have acquired this disease."

Mothers are quite concerned, and they claim that some months ago, authorities from the Michoacan Secretariat of Health were informed about this situation, but no action was taken. The mother of a girl who developed hepatitis, declared that: "Too many sick children were seen in this community; nearly 100 cases have been observed; we are sort of scared, since too many children are sick, and we fear there might be fatal cases."

Cases were 1st reported last September [2011] in the local high school, and later cases were detected in the kindergarten and in the elementary school, where cases multiplied in a few weeks. Dr. Veronica Estrada-Pizarro, physician in charge of El Colegio outpatient clinic declared that: "Cases started to occur around last September [2011]; some of them were directly brought to my office. I requested laboratory tests in order to confirm the diagnosis. Some other cases were seen in Morelia Children's Hospital, and some others were brought to private physicians."

School authorities also said they reported the cases to Morelia officials 5 months ago, when the number of cases increased markedly. Manuel Ponce-Ramirez, head of the primary school in El Colegio declared that: "Cases were found in my school, and they were reported to Morelia Health center; since then, 20 more cases occurred in one month. They were also reported to the local health center and to Tarimbaro municipality representatives, who once again communicated this occurrence to Morelia authorities."

The local outpatient clinic diagnosed nearly half of all the cases, and the remaining cases were detected in Morelia Children's Hospital, but local health authorities did not develop a program for stopping the transmission (of hepatitis A), so local inhabitants took actions together with school teachers and the local outpatient clinic.

Dr. Estrada-Pizarro explained that: "Symptoms may last for 3 days. I decided to isolate the affected patients, which is part of the usual protective measures, and I also taught both patients and their relatives basic hygiene measures, emphasizing hand washing."

Since there is no institutional strategy (from health care authorities), physicians urge mothers to follow strict hygiene measures. "We request them to disinfect (with bleach) fresh fruits and vegetables; cutlery used by infected persons must be separated so it can't be shared with other children, and children should stay at home taking plenty of rest so they can recover soon and to prevent the risk of transmission," Dr. Estrada-Pizarro said.

Relatives of infected children declared that measures to be implemented in the community are quite insufficient, since there has been no intervention from central health care authorities. "We brought our children to doctors, and they just told us that the diagnosis was hepatitis, and we were told to separate cutlery and to isolate affected children so there may not be additional transmission of the disease, said the aunt of 2 children who developed hepatitis.

According to the local school authorities, the only action initiated by the Morelia Health Center was to request that infected children should not be sent to school, but no further investigation (of the outbreak) was ever carried out.

Manuel Ponce-Ramirez, head of the local primary school, said that: "The agreement with the local health center was that infected children and their siblings had to stay home for a 40-day period, which corresponds to the incubation time for hepatitis A."

El Colegio community inhabitants and school teachers requested the Health Secretariat to perform a study in order to find out the cause(s) of this outbreak and to determine whether the cause is lack of water chlorination. Mr. Ponce-Ramirez said: "We wanted their support in performing a study in order to find out the origin of this disease, to determine whether contaminated water, pollution, or the improper placement of a garbage dump is the cause (of the hepatitis outbreak)."

The massive dog population in this community, on average 3 dogs per household, cannot be ruled out as a contributing factor for this outbreak, according to Dr. Estrada-Pizarro. "This may also be a actor, especially since dogs defecate in open spaces, stools get dry, and the wind may carry contaminated particles, putting them in contact with food." El Colegio community inhabitants urgently request health authorities to visit the community to perform appropriate studies in order to determine the origin of this outbreak. Ms. Martinez said: "We and our children are at risk. My daughter goes to the kindergarten."

The mother of a girl who developed hepatitis said: "No one from the Health Authority has come here; Dr. Estrada-Pizarro requested them to come over, but they only came here once to ask questions; this is all they did, but they said they would return later in order to assess the water and households, but they have done nothing."

The grandmother of children with hepatitis also said: "They said they would come back to assess the water and some other things, but they never did so." "We want them (the health authorities) to perform appropriate studies and to keep an eye on our situation, since we do need their help, and sometimes they might think there is no real problem here. They do not take our situation seriously."

On the other hand, the Health Secretary, Dr. Guadalupe Hernandez-Alcala, said that laboratory studies (for this outbreak) have been performed, and he added that in not more than one week, a diagnosis for this outbreak will be made. He also stated that: "This is a low-risk outbreak. When we have official confirmation from the state laboratory, we will officially release the information about all these cases. Therapy is being administered for these patients, many samples have been taken for performing studies, and 37 cases have been reported to my office," he added.

[Michoacan is one of the 31 states which, with the Federal District, comprise the 32 Federal Entities of Mexico. It is divided into 113 municipalities, and its capital city is Morelia. Michoacan is located in Western Mexico. It is bordered by the states of Colima and Jalisco to the northwest, Guanajuato and Queretaro to the north, Mexico to the east, Guerrero to the southeast. To the southwest, Michoacan has a stretch of coastline on the Pacific Ocean.

Hepatitis A is a viral liver disease that can cause mild to severe illness. It is spread by faecal-oral transmission when a person ingests food or drink contaminated by an infected person's stool. The disease is closely associated with poor sanitation and a lack of personal hygiene habits, such as hand-washing. Hepatitis A virus is usually spread from person to person when an uninfected person ingests food or beverages that have been contaminated with the faeces of a person with the virus. Bloodborne transmission of hepatitis A virus occurs, but is much less common. Waterborne outbreaks, though infrequent, are usually associated with sewage-contaminated or inadequately treated water. Casual contact among people does not spread the virus. Adequate supplies of safe-drinking water and proper disposal of sewage within communities, combined with personal hygiene practices, such as regular hand-washing, reduce the spread of hepatitis A virus (for further information see: http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs328/en/index.html).

According to the CDC website, the average incubation period for hepatitis A is 28 days (range: 15-50 days), not the figure of 40 days quoted in the above report (http://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/HAV/HAVfaq.htm#general).

The current situation in Tarimbaro is a distressing example of official complacency with regard to what is now a vaccine-preventable disease. - Mod.CP]
