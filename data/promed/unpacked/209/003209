Viet Nam's Department of Animal Health reported on Tuesday [18 Sep 2007]
that blue ear disease has once again broken out among pigs in Khanh Hoa and
Ca Mau provinces. Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome [PRRS], as
the disease is medically known, has killed 91 pigs reared by 7 households
in Khanh Hoa, in the central region.
In Ca Mau in the south, it infected pigs bred by the Agricultural Seeding
Center, killing 243. [The Chinese news agency Xinhua reported on 19 Sep
2007, "the disease has hit 90 among 181 pigs raised by 7 households in Nha
Trang City in Khanh Hoa, and 243 pigs in Ca Mau, the Department of Animal
Health under the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development said, noting
that their specimens were tested positive to PRRS." See

Authorities in these provinces are scrambling to head off the disease by
vaccinating, sterilizing, and slaughtering infected animals.
Blue ear disease 1st hit the central region in June [2007] and rapidly
spread all over the country, infecting around 60 000 pigs. At the end of
August [2007] Viet Nam had declared the epidemic eradicated.

[According to the information available at OIE's WAHID (World Animal Health
Information Database) interface, the PRRS outbreak in Viet Nam is
continuing. This, in deviation with the allegedly declared eradication of
the disease, mentioned in the newswire above. The summary of the epizootic
was last updated 1 Aug 2007; it includes the data of 44 outbreaks since the
reported start of the epizootic on 12 Mar 2007, and is available at
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=5199>.
31 of the outbreaks, in 8 provinces, were described in Viet Nam's 2nd (most
recent) follow-up report to the OIE, dated 1 Aug 2007 (see ProMED-mail
20070801.2479). The provinces and the number of outbreaks in each of them,
were: Quang Ninh (1); Quang Nam (22); Quang Ngai (2); Hai Phong City (1);
Long An (1); Thua Thien-Hue (2); Vinh Phuc (1); Da Nang City (1).
The current media report adds the provinces Ca Mau (southern area) and
Khanh Hoa (centre area); numbers 17 and 31, respectively, in the map at
http://www.angelfire.com/co/hongnam/vnmap.html>.
It has been reported that, in July 2007, Viet Nam's government asked FAO
(UN Food and Agriculture Organization) for assistance after the outbreaks
increased in June and July and samples have been sent to US labs for
analysis (see ProMED-mail 20070824.2773). Any available results,
particularly pertaining to the pathogenicity of the PRRS strain and its
genotyping, would be appreciated. - Mod.AS]
