Dr. Geoffrey Gardner, a Lakeland swan expert, is facing the challenge
of a lifetime. Something is killing the seabirds and swans on Long
Boat Key, and he has to find out what it is.

"Our concern is that it may be coming from toxins in the waters,
something coming from the dispersants that might have been used for
the Gulf oil spill," Gardner told FOX 13 on Thursday [23 Sep 2010].

The birds started getting sick and dying 2 months after the spill.
Gardner is wondering if seabirds may have come in contact with a
chemical in the Gulf, then migrated here.

He has an alternative hypothesis as well, which is a bit more
ominous: could toxins from the spill be showing up in our area?

Either way, wildlife rehabbers who discovered the problem are
concerned because they have been seeing an alarming number of gulls
and terns die lately.

"When you have 65 birds die in less than 6 weeks, you have a
problem," said Lee Fox, the founder of Save our Seabirds in Sarasota.

Gardner, a world renowned expert on swans, just got 3 of the sick
birds and examined them. He sent the body of a 4th one to a lab in
Orlando for testing.

[Birds can be sensitive to things they inhale. The chemical
dispersants or a breakdown product may be a contributing factor. It
may be something completely unrelated to the Gulf oil spill and has
not yet been identified. Let us hope the animal sent to the
laboratory for testing reveals a cause which can be treated. - Mod.TG]

More information on the etiology of this die-off from knowledgeable
persons in the region would be greatly appreciated. - Mod.MPP]
