Malaria epidemic in Karachi
----------------------
Malaria is rapidly spreading in the city [Karachi] due to a surprise
increase in the population of mosquitoes, with the result that
hundreds of people, including children, have caught the disease in
the past few days. According to doctors, a large number of malaria
patients are visiting their hospitals and clinics daily and that the
number of such patients reporting to the hospitals and clinics is the
2nd highest [on record?].
The secretary-general of the Pakistan Medical Association, Dr Qaiser
Sajad, told Daily Times on Wednesday that the population of
mosquitoes had increased not only in the suburban areas of the city
but also in its central parts, and almost all localities were facing
the same problem. Citing an example, he noted that a renowned lady
doctor, Dr Sarwat Jehan, had died of malaria in 2004 in the city, and
a child might die within 24 hours without prompt and effective
treatment.
He criticised the government for not giving due importance to the
dangerous disease and said that the authorities concerned had
continuously adopted a [negligent] attitude towards it. Dr Qaiser
said that it had probably been the 1st preventive attempt made in the
tenure of Ayub Khan when sprays had been arranged across the country
to eliminate mosquitoes. He demanded that the government take steps
on a priority basis to eliminate the disease by making arrangements
for anti-mosquito sprays in the city as well as in other parts of the
province.
Dr Muhammad Bakhsh Dahani, a doctor running his clinics in a rural
area of Malir and Gulshan-e-Hadeed, confirmed that he was treating a
number of malaria patients daily and that the number of such patients
was increasing day by day. According to the doctor, the disease is
spreading rapidly, especially in the suburban areas of the city,
because of poor sanitary conditions. He said that the severity of the
situation could be gauged from the fact that chloroquine, a most
popular medicine against malaria, had become ineffective. Dr Dahani
suggested to the authorities concerned as well as to the World Health
Organization (WHO) that attention be paid to the spread of malaria in
Sindh instead of focusing on polio only, as malaria and tuberculoses
had become common diseases in the province.
He said that the health system's failure, drug resistance, population
movement, deteriorating sanitary conditions, climatic changes and
unplanned development activities were contributing to the spread of
malaria.
According to Mr Dahani, prompt and effective treatment of suspected
malaria fever cases can significantly reduce malaria deaths. The city
nazim [mayor] had recently ordered the health department to take
preventive measures in this connection, besides making immediate
arrangements for sprays, but the authorities have yet to implement
his directives.

[Both _P. vivax_ and _P. falciparum_ malaria are endemic in Pakistan
in areas below 2000 meters elevation. The risk is usually much lower
in cities, because the _Anopheles_ mosquito needs clear water for
breeding. The spokesman of the Pakistan Medical Association
attributed the outbreak to a decrease in vector control activities
and increasing construction work, creating numerous new breeding
sites. However, a WHO report on malaria in Pakistan [See ProMED
posting: Malaria - Pakistan (Sindh) (20040308.0660)] stated that
malaria risk is increasing in Pakistan, so this outbreak may not be a
single accidental outbreak but part of an overall country-wide
increase in malaria risk.
The report in the Daily Times also mentions increasing problems with
drug resistance. A recent paper (Khan MA et al. Emerging
drug-resistance and guidelines for treatment of malaria. J Coll
Physicians Surg Pak. 2004;14 (5):319-24) reviewed the drug resistance
situation in Pakistan and found that resistance of _P. falciparum_
malaria to chloroquine varied between 16 and 62 percent, and
resistance to sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine (Fansidar) varied from 4 to
25 percent between regions. Information from the authorities showing
number of cases per months or weeks over the past 6 months would be
appreciated. Travellers to Karachi and the rest of Pakistan should
take malaria chemoprophylaxis, preferably with atovaquone/proguanil
(Malarone), mefloquine (Lariam) or Doxycycline. - Mod.EP]
