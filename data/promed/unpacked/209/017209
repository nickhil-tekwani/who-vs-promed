Foot-and-mouth disease confirmed in NW China
--------------------------------------------
China's Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) said Monday [18 Mar 2013] that foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] infections were confirmed in cows in northwest China's Qinghai Province.

A cow farm in Ershilipu Township of Xining reported that 2 cows showed suspected signs of the disease on 15 Mar 2013, according to the MOA. The National FMD Reference Laboratory on Monday confirmed the case as type A FMD.

To prevent the disease from spreading, local authorities have sealed off and sterilized the infected area, where 63 cows have been culled and safely disposed of, according to the MOA.

FMD is a contagious and sometimes fatal viral disease that affects cloven-hoofed animals, including domestic and wild species within the family Bovidae.

[China's follow-up report Number 1 to the OIE, notifying the above outbreak, has been submitted on 18 Mar 2013 and is available, with an interactive map, at
http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=13147. This report was referred to in the commentary to posting 20130318.1592575. The previous FMD serotype A outbreak reported in China occurred on 18 Feb 2013 in Guangdong (posting 20130302.1567750). This may indicate a wider spread of this strain. Information on the FMD situation in areas closer to the Russian border are of particular interest.

Genotyping results of the FMDV-A strain(s) circulating in China are anticipated.
