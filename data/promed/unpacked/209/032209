Highlights

- In week 04, the number of new confirmed cases has increased from 81 cases in week 3, 2020 to 95 cases. These were reported from 19 states (Ondo, Edo, Ebonyi, Enugu, Kano, Borno, Nasarawa, Kogi, Rivers, Abia, Adamawa, Benue, Kaduna, Delta, Taraba, Plateau, Bauchi, Osun and Ogun) (Table 3).
- The number of deaths has increased. The overall case fatality rate (CFR) for 2020 is (15.9%) which is lower than the CFR for the same period in 2019 (19.7%) (Table 2).
- In total for 2020, 19 states have recorded at least one confirmed case across 60 Local Government Areas (Figure 3).
- Of all confirmed cases, 89% are from Edo (38%), Ondo (38%) and Ebonyi (11%) states.
- The predominant age-group affected is 11-40 years (Range: over one to 60 years, Median Age: 33 years). The male to female ratio for confirmed cases is 1:1 (Figure 4).
- The number of suspected cases has increased but is lower than the numbers reported in 2019.
- 5 Health Care Workers: Kano (3), Taraba (1) and Borno (1) were affected in the reporting week 04.

Response activities

- The National Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) has been activated to coordinate response activities across states. Of the states with confirmed cases, 8 of them have activated state- level EOCs.
- Rapid Response Teams have been deployed from NCDC to support response activities in 5 states.
- The 5 molecular laboratories for Lassa fever testing in the NCDC network are working at full capacity to ensure that all samples are tested and results provided within the shortest turnaround time.
- NCDC is working to support every state in Nigeria to identify one treatment centre, while supporting existing ones with care, treatment and IPC commodities.
- Risk communications and community engagement activities have been scaled up across states using television, radio, print, social media and other strategies.

Notes on this report

Data Source
Information for this disease was case based data retrieved from the National Lassa fever Technical Working Group.

Case definitions
- Suspected case: any individual presenting with one or more of the following: malaise, fever, headache, sore throat, cough, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, myalgia, chest pain, hearing loss and either a. History of contact with excreta or urine of rodents b. History of contact with a probable or confirmed Lassa fever case within a period of 21 days of onset of symptoms OR Any person with inexplicable bleeding/hemorrhagia.
- Confirmed case: any suspected case with laboratory confirmation (positive IgM antibody, PCR or virus isolation).
- Probable case: any suspected case (see definition above) who died or absconded without collection of a specimen for laboratory testing.
- Contact: Anyone who has been exposed to an infected person, or to an infected person's secretions, excretions, or tissues within 3 weeks of last contact with a confirmed or probable case of Lassa fever.
- Active State: means where there has been at least one confirmed case, and contacts within 21 days post exposure.

Calculations
- Case Fatality Rate (CFR) for this disease is reported for confirmed cases only.

[The 95 new confirmed and 318 suspected cases in week 4 of 2020 indicate that Lassa fever (LF) virus transmission is continuing to accelerate. There are now 41 deaths among confirmed cases so far this year (2020). There were 5 infected health care workers during the current week (week 4). The report above confirms that Ondo and Edo states have the majority of cases. Nigeria is now well into the period of the year when more cases usually occur, as illustrated in the graph in Figure 6 (at the source URL above). There has been a peak in case numbers between weeks 1 and 11 (January-March) over the past 3 years, and it appears that this will be the case again this year (2020).

Transmission of LF virus occurs when individuals are in contact with rodent reservoir host excreta or are within healthcare facilities. It would be interesting to know whether the prevalence of Lassa fever virus has been increasing in populations of rodent hosts in areas where human cases are occurring.

Images of the rodent reservoirs of Lassa fever virus:
_Mastomys natalensis_: https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/45326-Mastomys-natalensis
_Mastomys erythroleucus_ and _Hylomyscus pamfi_: http://punchng.com/nigerias-large-rat-population-threatens-lassa-fever-war/
The pygmy mouse (_Mus baoulei_) has recently been implicated as a reservoir species in West Africa but not in Nigeria.

There is no specific mention in the plans above of public education for avoidance of contact with these rodents and their excreta.
