Today [18 Jan 2022] Americans can order 4 free COVID-19 at-home antigen tests at COVIDtests.gov, one month after President Joe Biden said he was securing 500 million free tests for Americans. Last week, amid the growing surge in cases caused by the highly transmissible omicron variant, Biden doubled the number of tests to be made available to one billion.

The tests will be sent via the US mail and should arrive within 7 -12 days, according to the website. Over the weekend, people with private health insurance were also able to begin submitting reimbursements for up to 8 COVID-19 tests per month that are bought at pharmacies.

The efforts come as cases in many north eastern cities appear to be plateauing or decreasing after a month of record daily case counts. In the last week, new cases have dropped by 17% in New York City, 17.6% in New Jersey, 22% in Vermont, and 25% in Washington, DC, ABC News reports (https://abcnews.go.com/Health/live-updates/coronavirus/?id=82303479#82310037).

Yesterday New York state recorded 22 000 positive COVID-19 cases, which is down by about 75% from the peak of 90 000 cases less than 2 weeks ago. The state's highest case count of the pandemic was 90 132 people, on 7 Jan 2022.

The United States reported 717 814 new COVID-19 cases yesterday [17 Jan 2022] and 1122 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins COVID-19 tracker (https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/cumulative-cases). The 7-day average of new daily cases is 723 849, with 1716 daily deaths, according to the Washington Post tracker (https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/national/coronavirus-us-cases-deaths).

But across much of the country, hospitalizations are still soaring, overwhelming healthcare systems and staff. According to The New York Times, the average number of Americans hospitalized with the coronavirus is 157 000, an increase of 54% since the beginning of the year [2022], and daily deaths have risen to 1900, another 54% increase in 2 weeks.

The HHS [Health and Human Services] Protect Public Data Hub shows 154 335 inpatient beds in use for COVID-19 patients, while hospitals in Oklahoma City are overwhelmed by a surge in omicron hospitalizations, with no intensive care unit or inpatient beds available, CNN reports (https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/omicron-variant-coronavirus-news-01-18-22/h_7c785e39fb003ca4357547366f00d703).

In an open letter from 4 major healthcare systems in Oklahoma, executives write, "Soon, you or a loved one may need us for life-saving care, whether for a stroke, emergency appendectomy, or trauma from a car accident, and we might not be able to help. This pandemic isn't just impacting care for COVID patients."

And nursing homes in Louisiana reported nearly 1000 new COVID-19 cases among residents in the past 2 weeks and more than 2700 new staff cases, according to the New Orleans Times-Picayune/Advocate (https://www.nola.com/news/coronavirus/article_f2236044-74b0-11ec-811a-ef08700993ea.html).

Late last week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) updated guidelines that rank the different levels of protection offered by various types of face coverings. CDC said well-fitted N95 and KN95 respirators provide the highest levels of protection against the coronavirus and removed concerns related to supply shortages for N95s. The agency said ensuring a proper mask fit, with no major gaps around the mouth or nose, was most important for protection.

[2] Europe and Asia: tightening COVID measures
Date: Tue 18 Jan 2022

https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2022/01/asia-parts-europe-tighten-covid-19-measures-due-omicron


Though early-hit countries are on the downslope of their omicron variant surges, others are battling rising cases, with some tightening their measures and others -- such as China and Hong Kong -- taking stronger steps as they try to head off steep rises.

Health officials in Europe have noted that omicron seems to be spreading from the western part of the continent to the east, though some western countries are still reporting very high levels. France today [18 Jan 2022] reported a new daily record high of 464 769 new cases, and health officials yesterday reported the highest hospitalization level since before COVID-19 vaccination began. The Pasteur Institute yesterday projected that omicron activity will probably peak in the middle of January [2022], with hospitalizations expected to peak later in the month.

Meanwhile, Bulgaria today [18 Jan 2022] also reported record daily cases, with nearly 10 000, according to Reuters. The country has the European Union's lowest vaccination rate, and officials recently changed its trigger for COVID-19 measures, basing it on intensive care unit (ICU) occupancy rather than number of cases (https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-bulgaria/bulgaria-reports-new-peak-for-daily-coronavirus-cases-idUSKBN2JS0FF).

In Russia, city officials in Moscow extended work-from-home rules and guidance, imposed at the end of October [2021], until 1 Apr 2022 as it braces for an omicron surge. Russia battled a 4th COVID-19 wave in the fall, and the omicron variant has been slower to gain traction, compared with other parts of the continent (https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/moscow-mayor-extends-curbs-says-tough-weeks-ahead-with-omicron-2022-01-18/).

Japan's COVID-19 cases have risen sharply since the first of the year [2022], and Prime Minister Fumio Kishida today [18 Jan 2022] signaled that he will tighten measures on dining and gatherings starting on 21 Jan 2022, according to Reuters. The rules will affect 13 regions, including Tokyo, and will last through 13 Feb 2022 (https://www.reuters.com/article/us-coronavirus-japan-kishida/japan-pm-plans-stronger-covid-curbs-for-tokyo-12-other-regions-idUSKBN2JS0S0). The country is also speeding up its booster vaccination drive by 2 months amid the dramatic spike in omicron infections.

China has reported more omicron variant detections, following the 1st confirmed cases in Tianjin last week. Beijing, where the Winter Olympics are slated to begin next month [February 2022], reported its 1st case 2 days ago, triggering mass testing and contact tracing, according to the Washington Post. Also, the city of Shenzhen reported its 1st case (https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/01/16/china-winter-olympics-omicron-beijing/).

More global headlines
---------------------
- A preprint study from Israeli researchers suggests that receiving at least 2 doses of vaccine may have a protective effect against long COVID. They compared symptom questionnaire answers of 951 people infected with COVID-19 with 2437 uninfected people. Those who received 2 doses were no more likely to report long-COVID symptoms than those who weren't infected (https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.01.05.22268800v2).

- The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness and Innovations (CEPI) today [18 Jan 2022] announced that it and the Pasteur Institute in Senegal have signed an agreement to form a regional manufacturing hub for vaccines against COVID-19 and other diseases. Vaccine production is expected to start in the 3rd quarter of 2022, with an initial goal of making 300 million doses. The partnership features a new fill-and-finish system using plastic pouches that can hold 200 doses, designed to ease cold-chain and transport challenges (https://cepi.net/news_cepi/cepi-and-institut-pasteur-de-dakar-partner-to-advance-covid-19-vaccine-manufacturing-in-africa/).

- The World Health Organization (WHO) announced on 16 Jan 2022 that the COVAX program recently delivered its billionth COVID-19 vaccine dose, the largest vaccine procurement and distribution in its history, which has reached 144 countries (https://www.who.int/news/item/16-01-2022-covax-delivers-its-1-billionth-covid-19-vaccine-dose).

[3] Omicron: will the variant end the pandemic
Date: Tue 18 Jan 2022 05:03 PST
Source: The New York Times via Seattle Times [edited]
https://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/will-omicron-end-the-pandemic-it-depends-on-new-variants-fauci-explains/


Even if enough people build natural immunity to COVID-19 by catching the highly contagious omicron variant, Dr Anthony Fauci said it is too soon to say if this will spell an end to the pandemic. On Monday [17 Jan 2022], Fauci, President Joe Biden's top medical adviser for COVID, was asked at the online World Economic Forum if this may be the year that the virus becomes endemic, meaning it is still circulating but does not disrupt society.

While omicron seems to cause less severe disease than other variants, Fauci said the sheer volume of cases could have a meaningful effect on collective immunity, but added, "it is an open question as to whether or not omicron is going to be the live virus vaccination that everyone is hoping for, because you have such a great deal of variability with new variants emerging. I would hope that that's the case," he said, "but that would only be the case if we don't get another variant that eludes the immune response." Fauci said the evolution of the pandemic is still an open question. "The answer is: We do not know," he said.

While cases seem to be leveling off in New York and other parts of the north east, they remain extremely high across the United States, averaging nearly 802 000 per day, an increase of 98% over the past 2 weeks. An average of nearly 156 000 people with the virus are hospitalized nationwide, a record. Deaths now exceed 1900 per day, up 57% over 2 weeks.

Fauci also said that the world is still in the 1st of what he considered to be the 5 phases of the pandemic. The 1st is the "truly pandemic" phase "where the whole world is really very negatively impacted", followed by deceleration, control, elimination and eradication. He said that only one infectious human disease has ever been eradicated: smallpox. "That's not going to happen with this virus," he said. However, once countries reach the "control" phase, when the virus becomes a "non-disruptive presence," then the virus will be considered endemic, he said. The rhinovirus and some upper respiratory infections are examples of endemic diseases.

As omicron continues to spread at a breakneck speed, some governments seem resigned to the idea that COVID is already a fixture of daily life. In some European countries, authorities are pushing a "learn to live with it" approach that includes shorter isolation periods and the elimination of pre-departure tests for travel.

[In the past 24 hours, 42 countries -- the USA (1 135 056), France (464 769), India (293 179), Italy (228 123), Brazil (132 254), Argentina (120 982), Sweden (97 248), Germany (95 098), Spain (94 472), the UK (93 890), Australia (80 464), Belgium (73 296), Turkey (69 658), Peru (62 098), Japan (53 213), Mexico (49 343), Portugal (43 729), Viet Nam (35 582), Denmark (31 491), Réunion (31 401), Netherlands (31 345), Russia (31 252), Switzerland (28 949), Colombia (28 849), Philippines (28 384), Japan (26 881), Greece (23 691), Hungary (21 219), Czech Republic (20 355), Poland (19 648), Canada (18 952), Serbia (18 006), Panama (16 987), Romania (16 760), Austria (16 685), Costa Rica (16 070), Norway (15 367), Martinique (11 610), Ecuador (11 027), Ireland (10 653), Uruguay (10 630), and Pakistan (10 506) -- all reported over 10 000 newly confirmed cases. A global total of 9964 deaths were reported in the preceding 24 hours (late 16 Jan 2022 to late 17 Jan 2022). The exponential rise in cases over the last few weeks can be attributed to the rapid spread of the omicron variant globally. The 7-day averages show an increasing global trend for cases and deaths.

A total of 77 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 43 of the 77 countries are from the European region, 9 are from the Americas region, 6 are from the Western Pacific region, 5 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 4 from the South East Asia region, and 10 are from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have increased by 13.4%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 8.2%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 0.48% increase in daily reported cases and a 7.1% increase in reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily report counted over 3.92 million newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours with over 335.29 million cumulative reported cases and over 5.57 million reported deaths. - Mod.UBA]
