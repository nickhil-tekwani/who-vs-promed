In fall 2019, a client called into Four Star Veterinary Service clinic in Mexico, Indiana, and reported the loss of a lot of sows. Daniel Gascho, DVM, knew the client and headed out to the business site, which was a buying station.

On the way there, Gascho said he had several ideas of what could cause the sow mortalities before arriving. But once he was on site, he knew he was wrong.

"It's really a good reminder no matter how many times you think you know all the diseases...Then you get there, and it wakes you up and reminds you, 'Oh, there's stuff out there you've never seen before,'" Gascho said in Pig Health Today.

Heavy death loss
----------------
The 1st clue of an unusual situation was the high number of mortalities. Gascho estimated a capacity of about 1000 hogs at the site. About 500 head died in a week.

"If so many pigs are dying so fast, I initially wasn't thinking a pathogen...because in this country we don't have many diseases killing pigs so fast, and so many," Gascho explained.

Then he explored the possibility of other "one-off stuff mentioned in vet school which you almost never actually see." One was a lightning strike, but it didn't make sense. The other was a toxin in the water or feed. "But the odd thing was, at the same buying station were multiple species. They were not affected. If it was something in the water, it's pig specific."

Next, he checked out the feed for the possibility of botulism, excess ionophores or anything else. But he learned the company bringing in the feed takes the exact same diet to other finishers in the area, and no other site was affected. He also looked at other environmental issues like stray voltage, ventilation failure or pit gases. These were dead ends too.

Forensic investigation
----------------------
"I felt like a forensic investigator," Gascho said. "I'm taking feed samples and water samples, checking other species, checking the environment and just really scratching my brain."

During the 1st visit to the site, Gascho did report the situation to the authorities in case it turned out to be a foreign animal disease. He also took a full set of samples for testing at Iowa State University's (ISU) diagnostic lab. "Of course, they tested for everything under the sun," he said. "Negative, negative, negative."

Smoking gun
-----------
Gascho was called out to the buying station again. This time, the client had brought in 500 to 600 feeder pigs for a roaster market. The pigs were in perfect health, but half of the pigs died within 48 hours of arrival. "It was still a disaster at this point," he said. "I'm standing in a pen...and pigs were literally dying in front of me."

Gascho again collected sets of tissues from multiple pigs as well as samples of feed, water, etc. He sent everything off to the ISU lab for more testing.

Eventually, the lab noticed an unusual pattern with a pathogen normally causing disease in horses and not swine. But in every sample cultured from the sick pigs, the same pathogen showed up.

_S. zooepidemicus_
------------------
The mystery was soon solved. Repeated lab tests showed the pigs were dying from _Streptococcus equi_ ssp. _zooepidemicus_. It was the 1st diagnosis of the disease in swine in the U.S. "It's just an extremely acute, full-bodied systemic bacterial sepsis, raging inflammation of every organ, organ failure and death," Gascho explained.

There was a silver lining to the diagnosis. "It was susceptible to about every readily available product we have," he added. And the pathogen also did not appear to aerosolize.

Gascho and the client were able to depopulate pens, clean and disinfect them, and successfully move new pigs in without any further problems.

Mystery solved.

[_Streptococcus zooepidemicus_ [a subspecies of _Streptococcus equi_] is a mucosal commensal and opportunistic pathogen infecting several animals and humans. Therefore it is a zoonotic disease. We seem to be seeing more issues with _Strep. zooepidemicus_. We have seen it affect dogs, horses, pigs, rabbits, and humans. Furthermore, it seems like we are seeing it on a boarder scale. The question becomes, are we getting better at recognizing this disease, or is the disease changing or spreading to affect more species?

_Strep. zooepidemicus_ can cause sepsis, mastitis, fever, inflammation of thorax, lymph nodes, or abdomen, and bronchopneumonia, and more, depending on the organism it infects. Currently there are recognized 7 different strains of this bacterium.

As we face a new decade, this may be one we will be seeing more.

The following has been extracted from https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4285269/:
"_Streptococcus equi_ subsp. _zooepidemicus_ is a facultative pathogen affecting animals and humans. Infections have occurred in horses, pigs, ruminants, guinea pigs, monkeys, cats, and dogs (1,2). Zoonotic transmission of _S. zooepidemicus_ is rare and is usually associated with drinking unpasteurized milk or through contact with horses by persons who usually have underlying health conditions (1-3). Few if any human case-patients with _S. zooepidemicus_ infection have documented guinea pig exposure even though _S. zooepidemicus_ infections have been described in guinea pigs since 1907 (4)."

From: https://microbewiki.kenyon.edu/index.php/Streptococcus_zooepidemicus:
"_Streptococcus zooepidemicus_ is a pathogen of animals primarily affecting horses, in whom it can cause diseases in the upper respiratory tract, uterus, umbilicus, and wounds (5). In cows, _S. zooepidemicus_ can cause mastitis (3), an inflammation in mammalian breast. As for other animals such as rabbits and swine, it can cause septicemia (3), which is a systematic inflammatory response to infections. This microorganism has also caused fibrinous pericarditis, fibrinous pleuritis, and pneumonia in sheeps. The overall symptoms of infections caused by _S. zooepidemicus_ include lesions, pyrexia (fever), serous to mucopurulent nasal discharge, dyspnea (short of breath) (23)."
