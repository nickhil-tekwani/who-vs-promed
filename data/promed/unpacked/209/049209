There are 11 cases of hantavirus [infection] so far in 2018, the statistics of the Departmental Health Services (SEDES) of Tarija show. Four municipalities are affected by this disease.

Of the total cases of [a] hantavirus infection, 3 died due to the disease; thus, epidemiologists speak of an elevated case fatality rate. The municipalities where these types of cases occur are: Carapari, Yacuiba, Padcaya, and Bermejo. The situation is most critical in the last municipalities mentioned.

The person responsible for SEDES Epidemiology, Claudia Montenegro, explained that the last case that occurred was in the Playa Ancha community in Padcaya. Because the disease was detected on time, it was possible to save the lives of these people. The [health] agency proceeded to block the disease; the municipality and Bermejo took action together to avoid more victims of the disease.

"Personnel of the health centers are capable of timely detection, and we know that there is a national alert, since Tarija has endemic municipalities and is working to prevent [hantavirus infections]," the official commented. Montenegro explained that the rains generated abundant food for the rodents, which increases their populations. This implies that this season has more risk of contracting hantavirus infections.

Since there is abundant wild-rodent presence, the management of rodent control is complicated: putting poison out would cause the death of other species inhabiting the wooded areas. This is why the recommendation for prevention includes placing metal on doors and windows and covering food and trash containers. It is also important to eliminate weeds around the house in order to reduce the possibility of contact with [rodents] that transmit the disease [virus].

The 1st symptoms of hantavirus [infection] consist of fatigue, fever, chills, and muscle pain. Some 50 percent of patients can suffer headache, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and abdominal pain. They may also show coughing and intense dyspnea. The disease progresses rapidly 4-10 days after the initial symptoms appear.

[Tarija department is endemic for hantaviruses, and cases occur there sporadically. So far this year (2018), there are 11 cases, and the numbers of cases of hantavirus infection in Tarija department continue to increase this year. The previously reported 2015 cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) that occurred in Tarija department were confirmed. As noted in the previous comments, earlier cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome have been reported from tropical, lowland areas of Bolivia, including 7 cases in Tarija during 2014. The specific hantaviruses involved in these or previous cases for the last 2 years (2013, 2014) in Bolivia were not given.

In the lowland Amazon Basin of Bolivia, the rodent hosts of the hantavirus that might be involved in these hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) cases, with their images, include the following:
- Laguna Negra virus (_Calomys laucha_ http://www.faunaparaguay.com/images/Calomys%20laucha%20enciso%2031aug2011.jpg and _C. callosus_ https://eee.uci.edu/clients/bjbecker/PlaguesandPeople/Calomyscallosusb.jpg);
- Bermejo (Chaco rice rat _Oligoryzomys chacoensis_ http://www.faunaparaguay.com/oligorizomyschacoensis.html); and
- Oran (_O. longicaudatus_ http://calphotos.berkeley.edu/imgs/512x768/0000_0000/0711/1203.jpeg).

Since some of these cases occurred in the Bermejo municipality, perhaps Bermejo virus was responsible for at least some of these HPS cases.

Dr. Jan Clement earlier pointed out the need to be able to differentiate Seoul hantavirus, with its wide distribution around the world, from hantaviruses found in the Americas. - Mod.TY

Health authorities in Herrera province this Friday 26 Oct [2018] confirmed the 1st locally acquired case of hantavirus [infection] diagnosed in this province so far in 2018.

The regional chief of the Herrera Public Health Department, Stayci Osorio, indicated that the patient is a 49-year-old male, resident of the Monagrillo locality. The patient currently is hospitalized in the Gustavo Nelson Collado Hospital, and his condition is stable, she said.

Osorio stated that the investigation of the case was complete, and health personnel checked his residence, work area, and all the areas where the patient said he had visited during the most recent 2 weeks, with the aim of mitigating risk of transmission.

She added that previously there also was a case, but it was imported. Osorio issued this statement on Friday [26 Oct 2018] during the celebration entitled "all against _Aedes_" that was carried out in the San Juan Bautista and Llano Bonito zones in the Chitre district.

An interdisciplinary public-health and vector-control team of the Environmental Sanitation [unit] carried out a house-to-house inspection and gave its recommendations to the general population.

[Although this is the 1st locally acquired case of a hantavirus infection in Herrera province this year (2018), there have been cases there in previous years. Hantavirus infections occur in neighboring Los Santos province more frequently. The specific situations in which these patients acquired the infection are not mentioned.

There is no indication of which hantavirus is involved in this or in previous cases in Panama. However, as noted in comments in previous posts, Los Santos and adjoining provinces are endemic for Choclo hantavirus. Although no data on this or the previous cases in earlier years include an indication of which hantavirus is responsible, Choclo is the only one of the 3 hantaviruses known to be endemic in Panama that causes HPS (hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome) or hantavirus fever. However, Dr. Jan Clement recently commented that Seoul hantavirus could also be present in Panama, causing human infections. Appropriate laboratory tests would be required to differentiate Choclo and Seoul viruses. No vaccine is available for the Choclo virus.

The rodent host of Choclo virus is the pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys fulvescens_), a photograph of which can be accessed at http://www.medwave.cl/medios/perspectivas/Hantavirus/Actualiz/Fig2.jpg. These rodents live in and around agricultural areas and adjacent houses and buildings. They can be persistently infected with the virus and shed it in urine, feces, and saliva, the source of human infections. - Mod.TY
