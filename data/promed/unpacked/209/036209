Bird flu found in 4th German state, near Poland
-----------------------------------------------
A wild duck and a swan [species?!] found dead near the Polish border have
tested positive for bird flu, marking the apparent spread of the H5N1 virus
into a 4th state in Europe's biggest economy, officials said on Saturday
[25 Feb 2006]. The dead birds were found on the edge of Schwedt, a city
near the border of Poland, a spokesman for the agriculture ministry in the
eastern state Brandenburg said.
He said the ministry did not have confirmation yet that the birds had the
deadliest Asian strain of the H5N1 flu virus. "The probability that it is,
however, is high," the spokesman said. On Friday [24 Feb 2006], 2 dead
ducks were found to carry the dangerous strain of avian flu in the north
western state of Schleswig-Holstein, while another one tested positive in
the south western state of Baden-Wurttemberg.
Most of the birds killed by the virus, 114 altogether, were in the Baltic
coast state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the majority on an island called Ruegen.
The bird flu found in all 3 states has been the deadly Asia form of the
virus, local and federal officials have said.

Romania detects new suspected bird flu case in fowl
---------------------------------------------------
Romania detected new suspected cases of bird flu in domestic fowl in a
village in the south east, but more tests were needed to see whether it was
the deadly H5N1 strain, authorities said on Sunday [26 Feb 2006].
Avian flu has been detected in 34 villages across the country and in a
small Black Sea resort since the virus was 1st found in the Danube Delta in
October 2005. Romania has not reported any cases in humans. "Veterinarians
detected suspected bird flu in the Topalu village in Constanta county," the
agriculture ministry said in a statement. Topalu is around 60 km (40 miles)
north east of the small Black Sea resort of Navodari, where bird flu was
confirmed last Sunday [19 Feb 2006]. It said all birds in the yard involved
had been culled, and samples were sent to a laboratory in Bucharest to
determine which strain it was. The ministry said there were 600 households
in Topalu, which have around 15 000 domestic birds.
The World Health Organization and local experts warned earlier this month
[February 2006] that Romania could see human cases of bird flu, because its
rural areas, where around 45 per cent of the 22 million population live,
lack proper water and sewerage systems.
The H5N1 virus remains difficult for humans to catch but has killed more
than 90 people worldwide, and experts fear it can mutate into a form that
spreads easily among people.

H5N1 strain of bird flu confirmed at Gujarat poultry farm
---------------------------------------------------------
At least 2 chickens found dead at a poultry farm in India's western Gujarat
state were infected with the deadly H5N1 strain of bird flu, government
officials said on Saturday [25 Feb 2006]. The birds were discovered at the
National Poultry Farm in the Utchal area of Gujarat, the region's
administrator, Vatsala Vasudev, told the Associated Press. She said
officials were meeting to discuss the next steps, including the possibility
of culling all birds at the farm and sealing off the area.
The head of Gujarat's Department of Animal Husbandry, DK Rao, separately
said the bird flu infections had been confirmed by tests in a federal
laboratory. Rao is on the state government's 4-member panel formed to
prevent bird flu cases in Gujarat.
Gujarat is located next to [north west of] Maharashtra, where an outbreak
of bird flu last week prompted the culling of hundreds of thousands of
birds. [map: <http://sunsite.tus.ac.jp/asia/india/maps/indiamap.gif>].
No human cases of H5N1 have been reported in either state.
On Friday [24 Feb 2006], the Health Ministry said tests on 9 people
suspected of having bird flu in Maharashtra's Navapur region showed no
signs of the deadly disease. "No human being has been infected in India,
but we are careful and will take all precautions," PK Hota, federal health
secretary, said.
The H5N1 strain of bird flu virus has devastated poultry stocks and killed
at least 92 people, mostly in Asia, since 2003, according to WHO. Most
human cases of the disease have been linked to contact with infected birds.
But scientists fear the virus could mutate into a form that is easily
transmitted between humans, possibly sparking a pandemic.
Some 200 000 chickens and domestic birds have been culled in India since 19
Feb 2006.

China: H5N1 found in dead chickens in Anhui
-------------------------------------------
On 22 Feb 2006, an expert team from MOA together with the Anhui Vet
department found that 13 chickens had died in Yinshang County of Fuyang
City, Anhui Province. [map: <http://www.world-gazetteer.com/maps/m_54.png>].
The National Reference Lab has confirmed the positive isolation of H5N1
HPAIV from samples from 4 of the dead chickens.

[The VLA avian influenza reference laboratory at Weybridge confirmed, on 25
Feb 2006, the HPAI H5N1 subtype in swans from Bosnia-Herzegovina and from
Slovakia, received on 22 and 23 Feb 2006, respectively. The swans' species
was not specified.
Croatia said on Sat 25 Feb 2006 that it had found its 2nd case this week of
avian flu in swans. The H5 virus was isolated from a swan found dead near
the coastal town of Trogir in the southern Adriatic (43.53 N, 16.25 E,
within Split-Dalmacija; map at
<http://www.world-gazetteer.com/wg.php?x=1140952310&men=gmap&lng=en&dat=32&geo=-98&srt=npan&col=aohdq>)
near the sparsely populated island of Ciovo, where the lethal H5N1 strain
of the virus was reported in a dead swan earlier the same week. Final
typing is anticipated. Croatia reported its 1st bird flu case in October
2005, when H5N1 was found in 6 wild swans on a fish pond in eastern
Croatia. - Mod.AS]
