NOROVIRUS OUTBREAK, STUDENTS - USA (DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA) (02)

[With regard to the ProMED-mail post entitled "Norovirus outbreak, students
- USA (DC) 20061217.3544"] I am doubtful that returning students will
spread norovirus to their communities. Endemic, sporadic norovirus is
likely already present in those communities. Our experience with annual
norovirus outbreaks in various institutions is that norovirus has already
been circulating widely in the community. Norovirus seems to be as common
as sporadic infections in the community -- pretty much the gastrointestinal
equivalent of the common cold -- and frequently these sporadic infections
get into institutions and flare up into clusters of infections.

[Dr Gould's comment is certainly relevant. The Health Advisory issued by
the Catholic University of America (CUA) may have very little impact on the
general gastrointestinal disease situation in the home states of the CUA
students. Surveillance data being accumulated in Europe, however, reveals
limited genetic heterogeneity among noroviruses circulating in different
countries at the present time. If such genetic heterogeneity extends to
embrace the antigenic properties of noroviruses, it is possible that
viruses transmitted by students or others dispersing on vacation might
cause disease outbreaks in other geographic areas (or even cruise ships!).
