At least 5 people died of cholera, out of the 29 cases recorded in Virei
District, south western Namibe Province, since 9 Feb 2008, ANGOP has
learned. The provincial director of health, Pedro Viyayauka, said other 45
cases were recorded in Namibe District in the same month, totalling 74 in
the whole province.

There is medicine and medical assistance, he said, adding that people are
advised to follow the preventive measures.

[2] Cholera - Namibia (Ohangwena)
Date: Fri 14 March 2008

Nine more suspected cholera cases have been reported in the north, bringing
to 137 the number of infected people in a week. Under-secretary in the
Ministry of Health and Social Services, Dr Norbert Foster, yesterday
afternoon [13 Mar 2008] told New Era that the number of suspected cholera
cases increased from 128 on Wednesday [12 Mar 2008) to 137 in one day.

Since the disease broke out last Saturday [8 Mar 2008], 2 deaths have been
recorded. Of the reported cases, 8 have been confirmed as cholera and 14
patients are admitted at Engela State Hospital. Foster says the rise in the
number of suspected cholera cases is expected given the water situation in
the North. The ministry together with stakeholders is, however, trying to
bring the situation under control by intensifying community awareness on
cholera. Water purification sachets have been distributed to communities
but according to Forster, not every community might have been reached yet.
While water purification remains key to preventing the spread of the
disease, Foster says boiling water might not be easy especially among
communities in villages that heavily depend on firewood for energy.

Following an outbreak of diarrhea 9 children have been reported dead in
Aguata local government area. Acting chairman of the council, Mr Richard
Obi who spoke to newsmen on the outbreak of the endemic disease said the
affected children were between the ages of one and 3 years. 4 of the
children died at a private hospital in Nkpologwu while 5 children died at a
private hospital in Ekwulobia.

Obi said the local government had to quickly rush to the aid of the
hospitals to save further deaths by distributing 50 cartons of ORT [oral
rehydration therapy] to all the health centers in the council area.

Apart from the area of health, Obi said the council had paid its own
counterpart fund of N19, under the EU project for the provision of
boreholes in the local government area, adding that presently, 15 boreholes
were being drilled in 10 selected communities in Aguata.

[4] Cholera - Zimbabwe (Mashonaland West)

A cholera outbreak suspected to be affecting mostly fishmongers along the
Zambezi River and Kariba has hit parts of the Sanyati Gorge and Hurungwe in
Mashonaland West Province.

However, health officials said intervention and assessment of the full
extent of the outbreak was being hampered by the areas' inaccessibility
because of the bad state of the roads. The affected areas include Mudzimu,
Mafanzou, Mutambirwa, and the Gache Gache area.

Mashonaland West provincial medical director Dr Wenceslaus Nyamayaro
confirmed the outbreak adding that efforts were underway to get to the
affected areas and render assistance. "There is an outbreak but current
efforts to get to the affected areas are being hampered by the terrain in
the area because our personnel have to go down the gorge to get to the
affected people especially in the Sanyati Gorge," he said. Dr Nyamayaro
urged people travelling to affected areas to practise hygiene and to ensure
they consumed heated food and drank boiled water.

[5] Cholera - Uganda (Arua)

So far, 6 people have died of cholera in Arua district. According to the
district director for health services, Dr Patrick Anguzu, 280 cases had
been recorded between 1 Jan 2008 and 9 Mar 2008. On Saturday and Sunday
[8-9 Mar 2008] alone, over 30 patients were admitted at Oli, the main
treatment center. Anguzu said the majority of the patients were from Oli,
Tanganyika, Adalafu, and Kenya wards. The crowded slums lack water and
sanitation facilities, he added.

The disease, which was reported in January 2008, Anguzu added, had been
also reported in Offaka, Okollo, Ajia, and Pajulu sub-counties. Anguzu
commended the Medecins Sans Frontieres for providing tents to create more
room at the isolation ward and the United Nations Children's fund [UNICEF]
and the health ministry for availing the drugs.

Anguzu added that although the cholera outbreak could be blamed on poor
sanitation, it was also exacerbated by the inconsistent water supply by the
National Water and Sewerage Corporation (NWSC). A water shortage hit Arua
town in January 2008 when supply was cut off due to mechanical and power
problems. Officials at NWSC blamed the power shortage on the West Nile
Rural Electrification Company, which reduced supply from 18 hours to only 5
a day. David Ocema, the NWSC plant overseer, said there was insufficient
electricity to run the purifying plant.

According to local newspaper Youth on Friday [14 Mar 2008], 7 people from
Viet Nam's capital city Hanoi have been hospitalized over the past 3 days,
after showing acute diarrhea symptoms.

All the suspected cases of acute diarrhea ate dishes either made from raw
materials or sold at small street-side shops before developing the
symptoms. Their specimens are being tested by the country's National
Hygiene and Epidemiology.

Between October-December 2007, acute diarrhea was reported in 13 provinces
and cities in Viet Nam. Hanoi suffered the most with a majority of cases,
some of which were positive to cholera.
