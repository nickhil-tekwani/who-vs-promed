Two people in New Mexico have tested positive for HIV after getting vampire facials on 2 May 2019.

As per the news report, the VIP Spa in old town Albuquerque (the largest city in New Mexico) shut down last year [2018] after reports of an unidentified infection being imparted to the visitors. Now, it has been made public that 2 visitors had contracted HIV after obtaining a vampire facial.

A vampire facial is a common phrase for platelet-rich plasma therapy treatments. These treatments typically include blood from a consumer's arm being removed for the platelet-rich plasma through a centrifuge (a piece of equipment) and then reuse to the patient's face. While doing this could leave the patient with a more youthful appearance, if not done properly then he/she subjected to blood-borne infections.

After conducting an investigation, the New Mexico Department of Health stated that unsafe storage and handling of needles caused the donor to contract HIV. The New Mexico Department of Health has since disclosed a statement urging consumers who have [been] getting vampire facials from the VIP Spa in May or June of 2018 to test for HIV and hepatitis A and B [? Hepatitis viruses A, as well as hepatitis E, are spread by fecal contamination and are rarely considered blood borne pathogens. The other hepatitis B and C viruses are blood borne. - Mod.ML]. These tests may be directed for free.

While over 100 VIP Spa clients have already been tested, the New Mexico Department of Health is reaching out to ensure that testing and counseling services are available for each individual receiving injection-related services at the VIP Spa, Secretary of Health Kathy Kunkel stated. Testing is important for everybody, as there are effective treatments for HIV and many hepatitis infections.

[Platelets contain many bioactive proteins that are thought to be active in tissue healing (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4338460/). Platelet rich plasma (PRP) is a biological product in which the plasma fraction of autologous blood has a platelet concentration above the baseline. Its use in tissue regeneration, wound healing, scar revision, and skin rejuvenation has become increasingly popular (https://www.karger.com/Article/Pdf/477353). However, the effectiveness of PRP remains controversial (https://www.healio.com/orthopedics/sports-medicine/news/print/orthopedics-today/%7Bbac6fbfd-a204-479f-ae5f-ca3a4f3081d1%7D/platelet-rich-plasma-promises-pain-relief-and-healing-but-remains-controversial).

Platelet rich plasma (PRP) is obtained from a sample of patients' blood drawn at the time of treatment, and, after the addition of an anticoagulant, processed immediately by differential centrifugation into autologous concentrated PRP via commercially available PRP kits (https://www.harvesttech.com/clinician/clinician-home/harvest-platelet-concentrate-system and https://drprpusa.com/product/prp-kit-sample-with-accessories/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI_4770_uU4gIVDV8NCh0pdA5rEAMYASAAEgLJU_D_BwE) or in-house schemes (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4338460/).

The news report above says the New Mexico Department of Health found that the cause for the donors to contract HIV was "unsafe storage and handling of needles," and others who got "vampire facials" from the VIP Spa in May or June of 2018 may have been similarly exposed to HIV and hepatitis B. However, the exact mechanism for contamination of the needles was not disclosed. More information on this outbreak would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.ML
