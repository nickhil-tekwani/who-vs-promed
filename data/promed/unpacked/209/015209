Doctors are scrambling to find hundreds of Queenslanders who may have unknowingly contracted a highly infectious strain of potentially lethal tuberculosis {TB}.

A homeless Aboriginal man -- recently diagnosed at Mossman, north of Cairns, after travelling around the state -- has been identified as the source of the outbreak. TB experts have sought to contact all GPs [general practitioners] in far north Queensland, warning the case could develop into an epidemic of "potentially catastrophic consequences" if not contained early.

However, Queensland's Chief Health Officer, Jeannette Young, yesterday [19 Oct 2012] said there was little risk to the general public, and only people who had come into close, sustained contact with the man were in danger of contracting the disease. "The biggest problem with him is we can't find the contacts (people he could have infected) without going through this process (of contacting doctors)," Dr Young said.

A total of 5 people are known to have caught tuberculosis -- which is spread through the air by coughing and sneezing -- from the man. The Weekend Australian has obtained a letter sent by Stephen Vincent, director of thoracic medicine in the Cairns and Hinterland Hospital and Health Service, to general practitioners in far north Queensland last month [September 2012], warning doctors of the "highly infectious case."

"This particular patient has travelled far and wide across the state and so far has infected a number of people including individuals in the Cairns district," Dr Vincent wrote. He advises doctors to pay special attention to high-risk patients -- those who are alcohol-dependent, homeless or indigenous -- and who are exhibiting symptoms such as unexplained weight loss, increasing night sweats and a worsening cough.

Usually, once someone is diagnosed with tuberculosis, doctors can visit their home and workplace to screen relatives and colleagues. Once identified, drug sensitive TB can be treated simply and effectively with antibiotics. However, in this case, the man had travelled widely and come in contact with dozens of people.

Dr Vincent, a TB expert speaking in his capacity as a private physician, said more than 200 people in the state could have been infected by the one man. "I would call it an epidemic of potentially catastrophic consequences if not contained early," he said.

"This is why we need to keep the QTBCC (Queensland Tuberculosis Control Centre) running." Dr Young said the Queensland government had "reassessed" its decision to disband the central Brisbane-based service and hand responsibility to the state's 17 new local health and hospital boards. She said while the centre would lose some administration staff and senior management, most of its clinical team would be embedded in Brisbane's Princess Alexandria Hospital.

"The idea was that all the (local) facilities would run their own TB service; now the decision has been made to keep a central unit at the PA that would provide the services for multiple (districts)," Dr Young said. "It's a reassessment that some facilities don't feel confident (to manage TB on their own)."

A [20-year-old] young woman from Papua New Guinea [PNG's Daru Island] has contracted a deadly variant of tuberculosis and is quarantined in Cairns Base Hospital for probably the next two years. [She] is one of 6 confirmed cases and the 1st in a potential wave of medical refugees fleeing an outbreak of the incurable form of the illness, known as XDR-TB (Extensively Drug Resistant TB).

Australian and Papua New Guinean authorities are trying to contain XDR-TB to the shantytowns of Daru Island, near the mouth of the Fly River, off the tip of Cape York. But TB medical experts warn the fresh outbreak of a highly contagious mutated form of TB is a "public health disaster" likely to spread into the Australian population within 5 years.

"It is an airborne disease," said the patient, speaking to The Courier-Mail from her hospital bed in an isolation ward at Cairns Base Hospital. "You feel sick, dizzy, tired, short of breath, full of coughing." She used to work at a food store in Daru before a friend in Australia sponsored her tourist visa and airfares to make the 1300 km cross-border mercy dash from Daru to Cairns via Port Moresby. She has been in isolation in hospital for 5 months, undergoing radical treatment since 24 May 2012, and is likely to stay in Australia in medical care for the next 2 years. XDR-TB is estimated to cost between AUD 500 000 [USD 516 625] and AUD 1 million [USD 1 033 250] a patient, with a low cure rate and a very high death rate.

"Before she died, my schoolfriend passed it to me," said the patient, whose weight fell below 40 kg. "She was coughing. It spreads through the air." If the patient was to return home she would be dead within a month, her doctors say. One person dies every 2 hours of TB in PNG. Patients with other illnesses such as HIV/AIDS, cholera or malaria are most at risk.

Respiratory specialist and TB expert Dr Steve Vincent said the latest outbreak of the mutated XDR-TB was a public health disaster, likely to cost billions. "It is inevitable it will spread into the Australian population," Dr Vincent said. "Patients get profound weight loss, night sweats, coughing, then they fade out and die." Dr Graham Simpson, another TB specialist, said: "Anything we do is too little, too late. This outbreak is what we have been worried about for years."

Health experts are divided over the handling of the cross-border crisis by the Federal Government, AusAid, and the AusAid-funded World Vision who head the $2.9 million, 3-year "Stop TB in Western Province" program. The Queensland Government shut down health clinics at nearby Boigu and Saibai islands in June [2012] and sent home 92 PNG patients. Official figures show 268 new cases of TB in Western Province between February and September before the newly confirmed outbreak of mutated XDR-TB.

World Vision PNG director Dr Curt von Boguslawski said he believed containment was best. "It can be very contagious, if you are sitting on a plane, and someone has got drug-resistant TB behind you, and they cough at you, you can get it immediately," he said. "I'd be lying if I said I was happy with any health facilities in PNG. But TB is a killer, and TB treatment in PNG is free. It is best we treat them here in the villages."

Federal MP Warren Entsch has been a vocal critic of the AusAid response to deliver an interim isolation ward, X-ray unit and a custom-built sea ambulance to support Daru's decrepit hospital. The Coalition chief whip said it was "corrupt at worst and completely inadequate at best." The World Health Organisation will conduct an independent assessment of the TB program in Western Province in November [2012].

Health officials have been accused of not doing enough to prevent an outbreak of a mutant strain of the killer lung disease tuberculosis spreading into north Queensland. But health authorities claim there is little to worry about.

The Courier-Mail yesterday [19 Oct 2012] revealed one of Australia's 1st cases of mutated XDR-TB (Extensively Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis) in a Papua New Guinean woman aged 20 years being treated in isolation at Cairns Base Hospital. Experts warn she is the 1st in a wave before the highly contagious, incurable, untreatable form of TB spreads. But Queensland's chief health officer Dr Jeannette Young yesterday played down the immediate threat. "Queensland is not at risk but certainly PNG [Papua New Guinea] is at risk, if we don't assist them as much as possible," she said.

Queensland taxpayers footed a AUD 32 million [USD 33 064 000] bill for the treatment for tuberculosis of about 100 Papua New Guineans over the past 2 years, with 92 patients handed back by Queensland Health in June -- 65 of them fully treated.

Health Minister Lawrence Springborg's office said that despite being an international matter, the Commonwealth did not fully fund health services to PNG nationals. The disagreement means Queensland must accept a Project Agreement by June or risk losing AUD 8.1 million [USD 8 369 325] in Commonwealth funding. Senate Estimates heard on Thursday that of AusAID's AUD 104 million [USD 107 458 000] allocation to the PNG health sector, only AUD 5.8 million [USD 5 992 850] was for programs relating to tuberculosis, of which PNG has the world's highest infection rate. Opposition Parliamentary Secretary Teresa Gambaro said: "PNG is our nearest neighbour we need to be doing more."

[The 1st news report apparently concerns difficulty in finding the possibly many close contacts to determine if tuberculosis was transmitted to them from a homeless Aboriginal man with contagious tuberculosis, who is know to have infected 5 people. The article does not mention if these infections are due to _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ that is susceptible to anti-tuberculosis antimicrobial drugs or is a multidrug-resistant (MDR) strain. The article does mention problems that Queensland is having funding the management of tuberculosis in the province. The other 2 news reports concern importation of MDR-TB from Papua New Guinea (PNG), the local spread of imported MDR-TB in Queensland and how best to manage this problem.

The following has been extracted from moderator ML's comments in a prior ProMED-mail post Tuberculosis, MDR - Papua New Guinea 20080206.0478:

Papua New Guinea (PNG), which gained its independence from Australia in 1975, is called officially the Independent State of PNG. It occupies the eastern half of the island of New Guinea and numerous offshore islands (the western portion of the island is occupied by the Indonesian provinces of Papua and West Papua). The majority of its population of almost 6 million lives in traditional societies and practices subsistence-based agriculture (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papua_New_Guinea).

The Torres Strait Islands, which Australia officially annexed in 1879, are situated in the Torres Strait between mainland Australia (Queensland) and PNG
(http://www.abc.net.au/ra/pacific/places/country/torres_strait_islands.htm).

The Torres Strait Islands Treaty signed by Australia and PNG allows for free movement of people (without passports or visas) between the Torres Strait Islands and PNG for traditional activities. The Torres Strait Islanders, who are culturally akin to the coastal peoples of PNG, became citizens of Queensland, Australia, in 1967 with full access to health and social services and freedom to travel and work in Australia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait_Islanders). Many thousands of Torres Strait Islanders are said to live in Queensland today.

An article in the Medical Journal of Australia (MJA)
(http://www.mja.com.au/public/issues/188_03_040208/gil10334_fm.html) that reviewed the molecular epidemiology of MDR-TB strains isolated from patients living in the Western Province of PNG, who sought treatment between 2000-and 2006 in the Torres Strait Islands because of limited access to health care in the Western Province of PNG. Of the 60 TB isolates, 15 (25 percent) were MDR. Because travel from PNG to the Torres Strait Islands is difficult and costly, only the more affluent and in better clinical condition likely made the trip. Nevertheless, of the 15 patients with MDR-TB, 6 were known to have died and 2 were presumed to have died. The MJA article states that none were XDR-TB. Genotyping identified in 14 of the 15 isolates a single type ("Beijing-family"), said to be the most prevalent type in Southeast Asia. The frequency of MDR-TB in PNG is unknown; however, the authors say that in the past 2 years 30 MDR-TB strains have been identified in Australia, with one 3rd originating from the Western province of PNG.

An accompanying editorial in the MJA [Bastian I, Krause VL. Tuberculosis: the disease that didn't disappear Med J Aust 2008; 188 (3): 131-132] noted that about 85 percent of TB cases in Australia in 2006 occurred among foreign-born persons, who originate mostly from Africa, the Indian subcontinent, China, and Southeast Asia. Although noting that transmission from the immigrant communities to the general population of Australia has been negligible, this editorial reports a recent increase of TB among health care workers, who have been mainly recruited from high-incidence tuberculosis countries. To reduce TB among immigrants from neighboring high-incidence countries, this editorial suggests that Australia should fund expansion of clinical and laboratory TB control into these neighboring countries (see also for an article relevant to the U.S., Schwartzman K, Oxlade O, Barr RG et al. Domestic returns from investment in the control of tuberculosis in other countries. N Engl J Med 2005; 353:1008-20).

A separate study published in the same edition of MJA
(http://www.mja.com.au/public/issues/188_03_040208/gra10272_fm.html) found among 1147 illegal alien fishermen (over 90 percent from Indonesia), who were detained in Australia, 8 smear-positive (contagious) cases of tuberculosis, one MDR-TB case, and a very high prevalence of culture-positive TB (1020 per 100 000 people).

The annual incidence of TB in PNG is estimated to be 233 per 100 000 population and TB is one of its 3 leading causes of death
(http://www.mja.com.au/public/issues/188_03_040208/gil10334_fm.html). (As a point of reference, according to the U.S. CDC, the annual incidence of TB in the U.S. in 2006 was 4.6 per 100 000 population http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/reprint/297/16/1765.pdf). TB is a major problem for people whose immune system is disabled by HIV/AIDS. Although HIV/TB co-infection has not been considered a problem in Australia, PNG has the highest incidence of HIV infection in the Pacific region; it is estimated that 2 percent of the adult population of PNG, approximately 64 000 people, are HIV-positive [http://www.adra.org/site/News2?page=NewsArticle&id=9863]. The HIV infection status was not given for the 15 PNG patients with MDR-TB reported from Australia's Torres Strait Island region (http://www.mja.com.au/public/issues/188_03_040208/gil10334_fm.html).
