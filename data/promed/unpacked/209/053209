Insects and diseases continue to threaten pepper
------------------------------------------------
Nearly 1000 hectares [2500 acres] of pepper plants in Dong Nai
province have been damaged so far this year [2011] by insects and
diseases, according to the Provincial Plant Protection Department.
High moisture content from heavy rains in April and May has created
conditions conducive to disease and insect outbreaks on pepper plants.
The 3 districts of Cam My, Xuan Loc, and Trang Bom and Long Khanh town
were the hardest hit.

The Provincial Plant Protection Department has urged local farmers to
clean up their pepper gardens and dig trenches for a drainage system
in the rainy season to prevent the establishment of diseases and
minimize the development and spread of insects and diseases.

[Black pepper (_Piper nigrum_) is known to be affected by several
fungal, nematode, phytoplasma, and viral diseases. Quick wilt (also
called foot rot) caused by the fungus _Phytophthora capsici_ has been
reported from pepper crops in Viet Nam before, but it is not certain
that this is the disease described above. A reliable diagnosis of the
pathogen(s) involved is needed for successful management of the
problem.
