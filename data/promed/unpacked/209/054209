A North Platte, Nebraska girl is recovering after contracting tularemia. Dr Tom Safranek, Nebraska's state epidemiologist, said 6 cases of the disease have been confirmed in the state this year [2013]. A 4 year old in North Platte is one of them.

The girl spent Memorial Day weekend [25-27 May 2013] swimming in Birdwood Creek and the Interstate lakes near Hershey. Afterward, her mother noticed a tick on the left side of her daughter's neck. She pulled the bug off and forgot about it. Soon after, the young girl developed a rash and fever and complained of neck pain. The lymph nodes behind her ear and by her clavicle swelled.

The mother, a registered nurse, became concerned that her daughter might have meningitis. She took her to Great Plains Pediatrics in North Platte, where another tick was found in the girl's hairline near her left ear. "The tick wasn't imbedded completely, but it was evident it had been there for a while," the mother said. "The site was infected. There was a red, swollen area about 3 inches [7.5 cm] wide that was hot to the touch." Cultures were done, and the girl was put on an antibiotic and sent home. When she started complaining about a sore throat a few days later, her mother took her back to the pediatrician's office.

"By then, she had pustules on the roof of her mouth and her throat was swollen," the mother said. "The areas where both ticks had bitten her were even more inflamed, and the skin around them was peeling." More cultures were performed and the girl was put on another antibiotic, which caused an allergic reaction. Ultimately, the girl was taken to the Children's Hospital and Medical Center in Omaha.

On 6 Jun 2013, the girl was diagnosed with tularemia, also known as rabbit fever or deer fly fever. Because of the mother's nursing background, officials at the children's hospital agreed to let her treat her daughter at home with IV Gentamicin 3 times a day for 9 days, with resolution occurring.

According to Safranek, tularemia can be life threatening. Caused by bacteria, it can attack the skin, eyes, lymph nodes, lungs, and other internal organs. Safranek said the disease is most common in mammals, especially rodents and rabbits.

Safranek said that the biggest problem with both tularemia and Rocky Mountain spotted fever, another tickborne disease, is that they are so uncommon they are often overlooked. "Doctors often misdiagnose them and prescribe the wrong antibiotics to treat them," Safranek said. "The good news is they are preventable." He said people should use care when handling dead animals, wear insect repellent and do frequent tick checks because the transmission rate is low if ticks are removed quickly.

[Although not apparently related to bioterrorism in this case, tularemia is a category A bioterrorism agent and the pneumonic form is likely to be the one associated with intentional spread.

Tularemia is caused by _Francisella tularensis_, a small, non-motile, Gram negative intracellular coccobacillus. It can be found in a variety of animal hosts, notably lagomorphs (rabbits and hares), aquatic rodents (muskrats, beavers, and water voles), other rodents (water and wood rats and mice), squirrels, and cats. In the United States an outbreak involving commercially distributed prairie dogs occurred in 2002.

_F. tularensis_ can be recovered from contaminated water, soil, and vegetation as it can persist for weeks under ideal environmental conditions. _F. tularensis_ also can be found in amoebas (such as, _Acanthamoeba_), which can become airborne in some settings, and may represent a significant environmental reservoir for this bacterium.

Humans can become incidentally infected through diverse environmental exposures: bites by infected ticks and deerflies; contact with infectious animal tissues or fluids; direct contact with or ingestion of contaminated food, water, or soil; and inhalation of infective aerosols. In one case, bacteria were aerosolized from the fur of a dog as it shook itself off after entering a home. Finally, there are several reports of tularemia in humans following bites from infected domestic cats. It is highly infectious, with as few as 10 organisms needed to cause disease. Humans can develop severe and sometimes fatal illness, but do not transmit the disease to others. The typical incubation period is 3 to 5 days, with a range of one to 14 days.

The clinical presentation of tularemia depends on the route of exposure. Airborne _F. tularensis_ would mainly cause pleuropneumonitis. Exposures that penetrate broken skin result in ulceroglandular or glandular disease. The onset of tularemia is usually abrupt, with fever, headache, chills and rigors, generalized body aches (often prominent in the low back), coryza, and sore throat. Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea may occur. Sweats, fever, chills, progressive weakness, malaise, anorexia, and weight loss characterize the continuing illness.

In this case, it was not stated what body fluids were culture positive for the organism but oropharyngeal involvement seemed prominent. - Mod.LL
