The Main Department of the State Production and Consumer Service in Lviv region reported that 3 cases of leptospirosis were registered in the region. The patients are in serious condition in the hospital.

One patient in a state of moderate severity with complaints of general weakness, elevated body temperature, lethargy, and muscle pain was hospitalized in the intensive care unit of the Lviv Regional Infectious Diseases Clinical Hospital. He had bathed in a local pond the day before. The other 2 patients did not immediately seek medical help after the appearance of alarming symptoms but were treated on their own for more than a week.

One of them had a drop in blood pressure, almost no urination, high fever, muscle pain, and intoxication. In serious condition, the patients were hospitalized in the intensive care unit of the Lviv Regional Infectious Disease Clinical Hospital.

In total, 7 cases of leptospirosis have been registered in the region this year [2022], 3 of them among residents of Lviv.

Doctors note that elimination of rats has not been carried out in Lviv region recently. Consequently, the number of rats is increasing.

Last year [2021], 11 cases of leptospirosis were recorded in the region, one of which was fatal. The cause of the patient's death was late seeking medical help (on the 12th day from the onset of the disease).

The main route of infection is contact: household -- 6 (54.5%); water (swimming, fishing) -- 4 (36.4%); food (eating food contaminated with rodent feces) -- 1 (9.1%). The likely source of infection in all cases was murine rodents and rats. All cases of the disease were confirmed by laboratory. Diseases from domestic farm animals were not registered.
