There is a health concern after a new disease has been spreading in Hyderabad [Telangana]. For the past few days, 15 people have contracted scrub typhus disease. They are currently being treated at the Gandhi Hospital in the city [Hyderabad]. Doctors say most of the victims are children. Recently, 4 children were admitted to Gandhi Hospital.

However, the number of scrub typhus cases has recently increased in many parts. In the Uttar Pradesh state, many children were infected with the disease between August-September months. There were also reports of several deaths.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), scrub typhus is caused by a bacteria called _Orientia tsutsugamushi_. It is also known as bush typhus. Scrub typhus is spread to people through bites of infected chiggers (larval mites).

Scrub typhus worms are usually found in beds, yard plants, moist areas [incorrect, see moderator comments below]. Medical experts say that these worms are similar in size to bedbugs in appearance [see moderator comment below]. It was also revealed that these worms are mostly found at night [see moderator comment below].

Symptoms of scrub typhus usually begin within 10 days of being bitten. Signs and symptoms may include fever and chills, headache, muscle aches, body aches and rashes.

Experts advise consulting a doctor immediately if these symptoms appear. According to CDC, a vaccine is not available to prevent this disease. It is essential to maintain good hygiene to keep the insects at bay. Avoid areas with lots of vegetation and brush where chiggers may be found when travelling to areas where scrub typhus is common.

[The vectors for scrub typhus are chiggers, the larval stage of trombiculid mites, which are not worms. Red-colored chiggers are so tiny that they can barely be seen with the naked eye. Chiggers have 6 legs, unlike the adult mite that has 8. Chiggers live on low vegetation at the junction of forest and grass. Chiggers pierce the skin of animals, including humans and rodents, and release saliva that dissolves the skin cells, on which they feed. Their bite causes intense itching, but they don't suck our blood like mosquitos or bed bugs (https://www.medicinenet.com/chiggers_bites/article.htm). A picture of a chigger can be found at https://www.rd.com/article/how-to-get-rid-of-chiggers/. After feeding on their hosts, chiggers drop to the ground and become nymphs, which then mature into adults that feed only on plant materials.

Mites serve as both the vector and reservoir for _Orientia tsutsugamushi_, the rickettsia-like organism that causes scrub typhus. Larvae can also acquire _O. tsutsugamushi_ from infected rodents and while co-feeding with infected larvae on uninfected rodents (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6136631/). Humans become infected when they accidentally encroach in an area where the infected chigger-rodent cycle is occurring, most often areas of low-lying scrub brush or transitional vegetation. The area endemic for scrub typhus extends from Pakistan in the west to far eastern Russia in the east to northern Australia in the south, although it has been described in locations outside this region (see ProMED post Scrub typhus - Chile: (Chiloe Island) western hemisphere 20160910.4478291).

We are not told in the news report above how the diagnosis of scrub typhus was made. The Weil-Felix test is commonly used to make the diagnosis of rickettsial infections, including scrub typhus, in resource-limited areas where more current diagnostic methods are not available (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK559225/). The Weil-Felix test is an agglutination reaction based on the fact that certain serotypes of _Proteus_ bacteria display antigenic cross-reactivity with _Rickettsia_ species, including _O. tsutsugamushi_. This test has largely been replaced due to its low sensitivity and specificity with new serological techniques. For example, false-positive results have been seen in 54% of healthy volunteers and 62% of non-rickettsial fever patients with the Weil-Felix test (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/23763648_Validity_of_the_Weil-Felix_test_in_the_diagnosis_of_acute_rickettsial_infections_in_Sri_Lanka).

The gold standard for diagnosis of rickettsial infections is indirect immunofluorescent IgG antibody assays of paired serum samples (one taken during the acute phase of the disease, and one taken 2-4 weeks later in the convalescent phase) (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK559225/). Results from a single acute serum sample are unreliable, as it takes 7-10 days for IgG antibody to be detectable, and antibody will be present in a high percentage of healthy people in an endemic region like India.

Hyderabad (population 6.8 million residents) is the capital and largest city of the Indian state of Telangana (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad). Telangana is a state in India on the high Deccan Plateau; in 2014, it was separated from the northwestern part of Andhra Pradesh as a newly formed state with Hyderabad as its capital (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telangana).
