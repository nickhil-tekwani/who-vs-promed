Due to a recent anthrax scare, the Regional Health Directorate in
Piura issued an epidemic alert Wednesday [16 Jan 2008] morning. This
alert came after the Regional Council of Lambayeque unanimously
approved to declare the region in a state of sanitary emergency
Tuesday morning. Regional Councilor Julio Paz said it was necessary
to declare the region in a state of sanitary emergency to begin
taking preventative measures and stop the spreading of the anthrax disease.

The 1st case of anthrax was reported on Monday [14 Jan 2008], when it
was discovered that a farmer had been killed after having been
exposed to the disease by handling an infected goat. After the
farmer's death, at least 7 other cases of people having contracted
anthrax have been reported.

Teams of specialists from Peru's Health Ministry and the National
Agrarian Health Service (SENASA) have been working in the affected
areas to find more people that may have been exposed to the disease
and to vaccinate cattle.

Walter Vegas Olaya, the head of Piura's Regional Health Directorate,
explained that the epidemic alert had been issued so that authorities
would be immediately notified of potential anthrax cases. He also
stated that teams had been deployed to seek anyone who may have been
infected. The epidemic alert includes the establishment of programs
that will inform farmers and the population in general of the
symptoms, risks and precautions that need to be taken when dealing
with anthrax.

[The most efficient way of controlling anthrax is to get ahead of it
and not react retrospectively. Secondly, humans cases are an
incidental aspect of this disease and involve but a fraction of the
livestock deaths. So concentrating on human cases misses the target.
The 2 most important actions are to have a surveillance system in
place so that livestock owners are encouraged (with carrots and
sticks) to promptly report unexpected deaths so that they can be
investigated and dealt with and to have targeted annual vaccination
programmes in areas at high risk. The latter cost effectively
prevents cases from occurring and the former means that when they
occur, they are properly dealt with and deficiencies in the control
programme are noted and corrected.

The problem of anthrax in coastal Peru is long standing and overdue
to be fixed. One of the attractions of proper and effective anthrax
control in livestock is that it results in the disease being
eradicated at no extra cost. - Mod.MHJ]
