Villagers' Fury At Anthrax Clean-Up; US firm set to decontaminate hall
-----------------------------------------------
A specialist firm moved in to clean up following an anthrax scare.
Health officials closed their community centre last November 2006
following the death of a man from anthrax. NHS Borders hired New York
specialists Sabre to investigate, and the firm found traces of
anthrax at the hall, where Christopher, of Hawick, Roxburghshire,
held drumming classes. Artist Christopher Norris, 50, is thought to
have been infected by contaminated hides he used to make drums. The
firm sealed the centre with a tarpaulin "membrane" and are set to
begin pumping chlorine dioxide gas into the building tomorrow [8 Mar
2007] to decontaminate the premises. But the handling of the case has
angered some residents in tiny in Smailholm, near Kelso.
Retired civil servant Chris Burns, 72, who lives next to the hall,
said: "Welcome to Stalag Smailholm," in a reference to the ring of
steel fences erected around the centre. He added: "It's a load of
nonsense; the hall's been used I don't know how many times between
when Christopher died in July and they closed it in November, and
nobody has had even a sniffle. They've spent hundreds of thousands of
pounds bringing this American company over twice, so that's a lot of
taxpayers' money. It's microscopic amounts of anthrax we're talking
about, and we held 2 ceilidhs [traditional social dances] in that
hall, a number of gatherings and even a meeting to discuss the
anthrax scare, and no one has been ill."
Another resident, who did not want to be named, added: "It's
outrageous. There's more poison in the pesticides I bring home in my
weekly groceries than there is in that hall. As far as I understand
it, there's no established anthrax link with the death of this man
last year [2006]. Now we've got lots of fat little men in dark
glasses who have descended upon this village, strutting about like
they're the Mafia. NHS Borders get a life."

[The villagers have a point. If no student drummers were affected or
attendees at the hall in subsequent months, empirically the risk must
be small or even trivial even if a few spores were there. Back on 17
Nov 2006, a spokesman for NHS Borders said: "As part of the ongoing
investigation, samples were taken from a number of properties in the
Borders. From the testing of these samples, minute traces of anthrax
spores have been detected in Smailholm village hall. As a
precautionary measure, the hall will be closed to further use pending
a decision on the appropriate decontamination strategy for the
property." Bureaucratic decisions in Scotland are no swifter than
anywhere else. Prompt action in November 2006 would have been
welcomed and also made the village hall available for Christmas & New
Year's celebrations and events. They were denied their traditional
New Year's celebration involving haggis, whiskey, invocations of
Robbie Burns, bagpipes and dancing. Instead, in Lent, they got Sabre
(the US company responsible for the disinfection). - Mod MHJ]
