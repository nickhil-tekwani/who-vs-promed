The Simcoe Muskoka District Health Unit (SMDHU) has declared an outbreak of Legionnaires' disease in Orillia over. "We are confident that with the testing, monitoring and completion of any required cleaning and disinfection of the cooling towers that continue to operate in Orillia at this time, there is no further risk of transmission associated with this outbreak. As such, the health unit is declaring the conclusion of this outbreak," said Dr. Charles Gardner, SMDHU medical officer of health, in a press release.

The outbreak has been traced back to the Orillia Rotary Place cooling tower, where the health unit says a strain of _Legionella_ was a genetic match with one of the 35 cases. Of the 35 infected individuals, one person has died.

The city says testing for the bacteria has been done every few days since the cooling tower resumed operations following the repair of the heat exchanger at the end of October [2022]. While tests done on 1 and 4 Nov 2022 showed no detection of _Legionella_ bacteria, testing on 7 Nov 2022 showed low bacteria levels within the cooling tower. Although the city says the levels are not high enough to be an active risk to the community, it's decided to shut down the cooling tower until a root cause can be determined.

This means the 2 ice surfaces at the West Orillia Sports Complex are also now closed. "The health and safety of our community are absolutely paramount. The most recent testing identified low levels of _Legionella_, and keeping the cooling tower at Rotary Place operational is not a risk that we are willing to take," said Mayor Steve Clarke. "We need to get to the root of what is causing this, and the facts are we don't know."

"The City has done everything we can operationally at this time. There are no legislated standards regarding the operation of cooling towers. The city will continue to rely on the advice and recommendations of industry experts, including a specialized engineering firm, to analyze the system for a plan of action moving forward."

As part of its investigation, 10 cooling towers were tested at 17 sites in Orillia, with the other 7 shut down for the season before testing could be complete.

_Legionella_ bacteria are commonly found in natural freshwater environments but can become a health concern in water systems such as cooling towers, according to the SMDHU. It adds that people can contract the disease when they inhale aerosolized water droplets containing the bacteria.

[ProMED thanks Dr. Colin Lee for informing us of the results of the Legionnaires' disease outbreak investigation in Orillia, Ontario.

The news report above says that there were a total of 35 cases of Legionnaires' disease in Orillia, Ontario; one of the 35 patients died. This cluster of cases with Legionnaires' disease was first reported in early October 2022 (ProMED post Legionellosis - Canada (02): (ON) RFI 20221008.8706034).

We are told in the news report above that genotyping of a clinical isolate of _Legionella_ from one patient matched the genotype of an isolate of _Legionella_ from one of the 10 cooling towers operating at the time of testing, confirming the source for that patient. But we are not told why there was no genotyping available from the other 34 patients. One explanation would be the diagnosis of Legionnaires' disease in the other 34 cases was based on positive urinary antigen testing, which is the most commonly used diagnostic test for Legionnaires' disease. The urinary antigen test detects only_L. pneumophila_ serogroup 1; this serogroup accounts for 80%-90% ofâ€¯cases in the United States. If urinary antigen test was done to establish the diagnosis, there would be no _Legionella_ available for genotyping.

We are also not told the results of _Legionella_ testing in the 9 other cooling towers. We were previously told that the city's cooling towers operating at the time of testing were either shut down or remediated in mid-October 2022. Since that date, there have been no additional cases, implying that the source has been eliminated.

Orillia (pop., 33 411 residents in 2021) is a city in Simcoe County, in a densely populated and industrialized region of Ontario, Canada (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simcoe_County), between Lake Couchiching and Lake Simcoe, about 87 miles (140 km) north of Toronto.
