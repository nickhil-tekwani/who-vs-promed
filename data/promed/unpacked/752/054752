A joint investigation between the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA)
and the USA Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service
(FSIS) has identified a likely source of the multistate outbreak of
_Escherichia coli_ O157:H7 infections linked to the Topps Meat Company.

On 25 Oct 2007, the CFIA provided FSIS with PFGE patterns, or DNA
fingerprints, from tests of beef trim from a Canadian firm, Ranchers Beef,
Ltd, Canadian establishment number 630. This firm provided trim to the
Topps Meat Company. While the firm, which had been located in Balzac,
Alberta, ceased operations on 15 Aug 2007, some product remained in storage
and was collected and tested by CFIA as part of the joint investigation of
the Topps recall and as part of CFIA's own investigation into 45 illnesses
in Canada from _E. coli_ O157:H7.

"We appreciate the assistance from our food safety partners in Canada. This
piece of information helped us to determine a likely source of contaminated
product which led to the 29 Sep 2007 Topps Meat Company expanded recall,"
stated undersecretary for food safety Dr. Richard Raymond. "We have a long
history of cooperation and collaboration with CFIA."

Today, 26 Oct 2007, PulseNet provided verification to FSIS that this PFGE
[pulse field gel electrophoresis] pattern matched those from patients who
were ill and from positive tests conducted by the New York Department of
Health on product (both intact packages and open packages from patients'
homes) that was later recalled by the Topps Meat Company on 29 Sep 2007.
PulseNet is the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC)
searchable database of all PFGE patterns from patients and food products in
the USA.

As of 26 Oct 2007, CDC reported 40 illnesses under investigation in 8
states, with 21 known hospital admissions. The latest onset of illness is
24 Sep 2007. This summer [2007] was the 1st time this rare PFGE pattern had
been seen in North America.

As the result of the Topps Meat Company recall investigation, FSIS had
delisted Ranchers Beef, Ltd., Canadian establishment number 630, on 20 Oct
2007. No product from that firm has been eligible to come into the USA
since that date.

Today, 26 Oct 2007, FSIS notified industry to hold all boneless beef
manufacturing trim from Ranchers Beef, Ltd, Canadian establishment number
630, or raw products produced in whole or in part from these products until
the joint investigation is completed. The Agency has also today issued a
Notice (PDF Only) to inspection program personnel in the field to retain
these products. Although products subject to recall should be returned to
the point of purchase, consumers preparing other ground beef products
should always follow the 4 Be Food Safe steps of Clean, Separate, Cook and
Chill. Consumers should only eat ground beef patties that have been cooked
to a safe temperature of 160 F. The only way to be sure a ground beef patty
is cooked to a high enough temperature to kill harmful bacteria is to use
an accurate food thermometer.

A defunct Canadian meatpacker is "a likely source" of beef that caused an
outbreak of foodborne illnesses in the USA and Canada, the USA meat safety
agency said on Fri 26 Oct 2007.

Nearly 100 illnesses have been reported due to the _E. coli_ O157:H7 strain
in the 2 nations. The USA Food Safety and Inspection Service said a
comparison of DNA fingerprints of beef samples pointed to Ranchers Beef
Ltd, of Balzac, Alberta.

Some 45 cases of illness caused by the strain were reported in 5 Canadian
provinces from July to September 2007, including a death, said the CFIA in
a statement. It said genetic testing found "the same unique _E. coli_
pattern" in beef from an unnamed meat facility in Alberta that is
"currently not operating." "All remaining product is under detention," said
the CFIA.

[It is not stated how much of the 21.7 million pounds of ground beef
recalled by Topps was obtained as either beef trim or ground beef from the
Canadian firm. As of CDC's latest report from 26 Oct 2007
(<http://www.cdc.gov/ecoli/2007/october/100207.html>), there were no newly
linked cases over the 40 cases in 8 states already reported. - Mod.LL]
