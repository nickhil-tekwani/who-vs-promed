[This outbreak seems to be restricted to a small backyard mixed-
type flock. This makes 2 similar Newcastle reports in as many
days from the region, although the outbreaks are not close
geographically. The Buskerud department is approximately 150 km
northwest of Oslo, in the south-central part of Norway. - Mod.PC]
[The report didn't say whether the pigeons were racing pigeons,
which could have been transported over long distances before
being released to return home. But I suppose they would not have
lingered long enough at the release point to become infected there.
Do we have any racing pigeon fanciers on the list who might be
able to enlighten us? - Mod.JW]
