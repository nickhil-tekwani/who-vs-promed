At least 2 persons were last week [week of 12 Oct 2020] admitted with anthrax related symptoms in Chipinge [Manicaland Province], prompting officials to dispatch a rapid response team to vaccinate local livestock. According to sources, the outbreak is now reportedly posing a threat to human life as there are suspicions that local butcheries are also stocking the infected beef for resale. Hunger stricken locals have also been consuming beef from ailing cattle, while others are finishing off the beasts and feasting on them.

Provincial Development Coordinator Edgars Seenza, who heads the provincial CPU [Civil Protection Unit] confirmed the outbreak as well hospitalization of the duo, who were exposed to infected beef. "We have received those reports from our local structures and we have since responded as the Civil Protection Unit and dispatched a team which is now on the ground.

"The suspicions were raised from 2 patients who got sick and were admitted at St Peters Hospital with anthrax-like symptoms, but these were treated and discharged," said Seenza. "The situation is now under control, we responded quickly to educate our people, and vaccinate because that area is already under constant surveillance," he added Seenza said the situation was now under control as the CPU is working closely with local structures and the veterinary department to identify hotspots.

The Division of Veterinary Services in the Ministry of Agriculture has since dispatched a rapid response team to deal with the outbreak which has reportedly claimed dozens of cattle herd in Chipinge rural. The outbreak is in Chibuwe, Dakate, Zamuchiya, and Chisumbanje where at least 15 cattle have perished according to the Manicaland Civil Protection Unit, in areas close to wildlife conservancies.

Councillor Charles Mugidho (Ward 20) initially raised alarm through a distress call that villagers were consuming anthrax infected beef urging authorities to intervene urgently to a serious health risk posed to oblivious villagers.

Acting Director Division of Veterinary Services, Dr Felistas Ndhlovu as said infected animals die within a few days, while for humans it can also be fatal but if diagnosed in time it can be treated. Dr Ndhlovu said Chipinge district is a designated anthrax zone where the movement of cattle is prohibited and receives annual vaccination for livestock to curb the spread of diseases.

She said the current vaccination exercise, which was now due, is targeting 87 000 herds of cattle up from 14 000 vaccinated last year in October [2019] to curb the spread of anthrax to outlying areas. "We are vaccinating against the disease in these areas, which is a gazetted anthrax zone and there is an annual vaccination plan, which was due as the last was in October last year. "Our challenge is that people fail to bring their cattle for one reason or the other, these difficulties in failing to round up all local cattle means that there are gaps in our annual vaccinations. We usually make retrospective responses after persons who consume meat from the dead cattle develop symptoms of anthrax. Late reporting is our key problem," she said.

Anthrax is a highly infectious and fatal disease to mammals which can be passed on to humans, and the Division of Veterinary Services categorizes it together with rabies, as diseases of public health importance.

[Our veterinary colleagues have this outbreak under control. Reading between the lines it would seem that they are enjoying what we have seen over the years in the US Dakotas and Argentina when ranchers fail to vaccinate their stock despite standing regulations. The good news is that these procrastinators make a public example and their fellow ranchers can take note. We wish Dr Felistas Ndhlovu and her colleagues success in their programme.
