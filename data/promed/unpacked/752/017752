From 5 Mar 2005 - 28 Mar 2006 [the latter is an obviously mistaken date],
3115 cases of chikungunya (CHIK) have been notified by 31 physicians from a
sentinel network on La Reunion, including 196 cases reported during the
week 27 Feb - 5 Mar 2006. Estimations from a mathematical model evaluate
that 204 000 people may have been infected by chikungunya virus since March
2005 on La Reunion, including 13 000 persons during the week 27 Feb - 5 Mar
2006. Between 1 Jan 2006 - 5 Mar 2006, 25 patients with clinical symptoms
consistent with dengue fever were laboratory confirmed. 5 were isolated
cases and 20 were suspected cases of co-infection chikungunya-dengue.
Since the beginning of January 2006, other countries in the south west
Indian Ocean have reported chikungunya cases: Mayotte (9 Jan - 10 Mar, 2833
suspected cases), Mauritius (1 Jan - 5 Mar, c. 6000 suspected cases
including 1200 confirmed cases), and the Seychelles (1 Jan - 26 Feb, 8818
suspected cases).
Several European countries have reported imported cases in people returning
from these islands: France (160 imported cases), Germany, Italy, Norway and
Switzerland.
A mixed outbreak of chikungunya, with sporadic cases of dengue has been
reported in Andhra Pradesh state, India. Between 1 Dec 2005 - 17 Feb 2006,
5671 cases of fever with arthralgia were reported. A high density of _Aedes
aegypti_ was observed in the area. From 1-15 Mar 2006, over 2000 cases of
chikungunya have been reported from Malegaon town in Nasik district,
Maharashtra state, India. In Orissa state, India, 4904 cases of fever
associated with myalgia and headache have been reported between 27 Feb - 5
Mar 2006. These signs are consistent with an arbovirus outbreak. Results of
a biological investigation are awaited.
Control measures:
A WHO team from the Regional Office for Africa and from headquarters was
deployed to the south west Indian Ocean in February-March 2006 to assess
the control measures underway in the islands and to discuss a sub-regional
coordinated strategy for surveillance and control of arboviruses in the
area with national authorities (see previous report). Additional expertise
in the COMBI approach has been sent to Madagascar and Mauritius for
follow-up. Similarly, Maldives has received support for their social
mobilization activities on dengue vector control.
In India, a multidisciplinary national team was deployed from 13-17 Feb
2006 to assist local health authorities in improving public health
measures, including strengthening of arbovirus surveillance, clinical
management of cases, vector control and social mobilization.
Although transmission of chikungunya and dengue is continuing in the
affected areas, WHO recommends no special restrictions on travel or trade
to or from these areas. However, it is recommended that individuals take
precautions to protect themselves from mosquito bites, e.g., by wearing
clothes that minimize skin exposure and applying insect repellents to
exposed skin or clothing in accordance with label instructions.

With the seemingly uncontrollable widespread epidemic of chikungunya from
the south western and western to the northern regions of the Indian Ocean,
ProMED-mail would appreciate greatly further information from knowledgeable
sources. - Mod.RY]
