More dead seals found along south-west coast of Sweden
-----------------------------------------------------
A team from the Swedish Museum of Natural History continued Tuesday
[10 Jul 2007] to investigate dead seals found along Sweden's
south-west coast for signs of a deadly virus that hits the mammals.
Marine biologist Kristin Johansson Monday conducted the 1st
investigation and took samples of what was reportedly the 1st find of
a seal believed to have fallen victim to the same viral strain of
distemper that had earlier decimated seal populations in the North
and Baltic Seas.
Johansson on Tuesday [10 Jul 2007] took samples from 2 more dead
seals, and said they had "typical symptoms" of the virus while 2
other bodies were too decomposed to take samples from them.
"The virus causes pneumonia and the animals cough a lot, air is
pressed out of the lungs into surrounding tissue and the heart sack,"
she said. When the dead body is opened, "the air bubbles pop," she
said during a telephone call as she headed to a new location.
Johansson gained first-hand experience of identifying signs of the
virus during the last outbreak in 2002. Confirmation of the virus
strain was pending tests to be conducted at a laboratory in England,
but her observations were indicative of the virus, she said.
The 3 dead seals Johansson investigated were between 97 and 103
centimetres [38.2 and 40.5 inches] in length, suggesting they were at
most one-year old and had no immunity from the 2002 outbreak.
The overall monitoring programme was handled by Tero Harkonen,
associate professor at the Swedish Museum of Natural History who was
in charge of a coastal section further north. The virus impacts
common seals but could be hosted by grey seals, Harkonen said Monday
[9 Jul 2007], noting that seals of both species move between Denmark,
Sweden and Norway.
Around half of the region's common seal population was killed by a
previous outbreak in 1998, while in 2002 some 60 percent fell victim to it.

[It may be assumed that the population at risk is the age group 6
months to 4-5 years, namely seals born after the 2002 epizootic which
have lost their maternal immunity.
Female common seals have a life span of 30-35 years while male
lifespans are usually 20-25.
Laboratory results of the recent suspected Danish cases
(see 20070624.2043) and of the current Swedish ones are anticipated.
