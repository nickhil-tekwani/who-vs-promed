A virus spread by voles has killed 20 people in the Russian region of
Bashkiria and a further 18 are critically ill in hospital, Itar-Tass
reported on Saturday. It said the virus caused haemorrhagic fever, an
illness the agency described as the "scourge of Bashkiria." Regional
officials had set up an emergency centre to combat the virus. "Orders to
start extensive anti-rodent measures have been circulated," Tass reported
from Ufa, capital of the autonomous republic of Bashkiria on the edge of
the Urals in central Russia.
[Although the etiologic agent is not mentioned, this likely is a report
of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome, the etiologic agent of which
are hantaviruses. Tula virus is known to be transmitted between
Microtus arvalis throughout Europe to the Black Sea and
northeast to the Kirov Region of Russia. Further details, from
knowledgeable people involved in studies of this outbreak, would be
appreciated. With the onset of colder weather rodents, as do the rest of
us, have a tendency to move indoors. Whether this has anything to do
with what appears to be an increased number of cases remains to be
determined.
If anyone has data (attack rates, crude case rates, case:fatality rates,
etc.) regarding this outbreak, please send them to ProMED-mail. Also, we
are interested in knowing the etiologic agent (i.e., Puumala, Tula,
other?). Thanks. -Mod. CHC
