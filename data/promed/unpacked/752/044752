[The European Commission for the Control of Foot-and-Mouth disease (FMD) monthly report "Global Foot-and-Mouth Disease Situation," January 2019, notes that:

"Five FMD outbreaks due to serotype SAT 2 were reported between September 2018 and January 2019 in cattle of Cabane, Makhado and Greater Giyani, Limpopo. These events caused the suspension of the country's FMD Free Zone. ARC-Onderstepoort Veterinary Institute carried out diagnosis. The source of the outbreaks was attributed to contact with wild species. Control measures are put into place, but not vaccination which at present is prohibited.

"Interpretation: This report is consistent with previous reports. The causative serotype is believed to circulate endemically in the country within wildlife in the Kruger National park. The affected areas surround the park and therefore the event is not unexpected given the country's policy of non-vaccination even in the high-risk areas. Infection is likely a spillover from wildlife in the Kruger national Park. Affected area is their surveillance zone outside the clean zone". Source: https://tinyurl.com/y3ebeeh8
