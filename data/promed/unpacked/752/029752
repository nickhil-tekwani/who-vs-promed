Of the more than 20 inmates in the public jail of the city of Bani [Peravia province] affected by outbreaks of diarrhea and vomiting that began about 15 days ago, 3 were found positive for the cholera virus, according to lab results released yesterday afternoon [26 Feb 2016] in Bani.

The reports of the National Institute of Forensic Sciences (Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Forenses -- INACIF) indicate that 3 of the cases analyzed by the scientific entity tested positive for the cholera virus, which has forced the health authorities of this town to intensify control measures since they were implemented last weekend [20-21 Feb 2016].

The data were certified by the department of epidemiology of the Provincial Directorate of Public Health [in Bani], through one of the technicians of that unit as well as by Dr Walter Lopez, medical director of Primary Care Unit (UNAP) of the jail.

However, Dr Lopez told Listin Diario that the outbreak has been controlled effectively, and for the past 8 days there have been no new cases among inmates at Bani prison for men.

It should be recalled that 2 weeks ago, this diarrhea and vomiting outbreak caused the deaths of 2 inmates, part of a group of 16 inmates severely affected by [the disease], of whom 12 were admitted to Our Lady of Regla Hospital, according to its director, Dr Olmedo Rodriguez.

Among the measures taken to prevent new cases of infection in this prison, as directed by experts from the Provincial Directorate of Public Health, Dr Olmedo Rodriguez, and Dr Lopez, the prison doctor, during the past week chemoprophylaxis has been given, antiseptic soap distributed, carpets with chlorine installed, and the food (juice and vegetables) provided to inmates is being controlled.

In addition, they worked with local government authorities to install a water tank for supplying safe drinking water, as well as a toilet so that fecal matter of the inmates goes directly to the health department of the jail.
