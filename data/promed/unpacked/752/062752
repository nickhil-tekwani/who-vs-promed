Tomatoes under attack by virus
------------------------
CHESAPEAKE -- [Tomato fields and home] gardens throughout eastern Virginia
[are being infected by a virus ... and it could mean that juicy, red
home-grown varieties will be scarce [this season].
The [causal virus is] Tomato spotted wilt [tospo]virus [TSWV] ... which is
spread by [thrips], ... [insects] that look like bright-orange, miniature
house fl[ies]. There's no hope for [recovery of] plants affected by the virus.
``It's unbelievably bad this year,'' said Clifton Slade, commercial
vegetable specialist at the Tidewater Agricultural Research and Extension
Center in Suffolk. ``We've had several dozen samples in the last couple of
weeks, and 90 to 95 percent show wilt virus.''
The [disease] is rampant, Slade said, from Richmond to Suffolk.
[At] this time of year, [the thrips cannot be seen because they] ... [have]
done their damage and moved on.
Clarke ... believes the problem is caused by an unusually warm winter which
allowed the insects to [overwinter. Another possibility is that planted
acreages of cotton and peanut were much lower than usual because of
farmers' questions about the new Farm Bill, and the thrips sought
alternative crops such as tomato].
... Farmers [use] expensive chemicals to help combat thrip[s]-related
problems but [they are not always effective].
Home gardeners, however, can replant with a virus-resistant [cultivar] and
still have ripe tomatoes by Labor Day.

monitored by ProMED-Plant in 2002. TSWV can cause severe crop losses on
many food crops. Are other areas in North America and elsewhere affected by
TSWV outbreaks? If any of our readers are aware of other TSWV outbreaks, or
