Bluetongue in north west Europe -- new developments, 9 Oct 2006
---------------------------------------------------------------
(Note: Defra's International Animal Health Division (IAHD) monitors
outbreaks of high impact diseases around the world. Bluetongue (BT) is
among those diseases of major concern)
1. Disease Report
This update builds up on our previous preliminary assessment
(<http://www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/diseases/monitoring/pdf/bt-nweu070906.pdf>).
The outbreaks of bluetongue in the Netherlands, Belgium, France and Germany
continue to spread, mainly within the previously affected areas but also
include some new adjacent areas (For daily updates, please refer to the
following Defra website --
<http://www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/diseases/notifiable/pdf/bt-europemap.pdf>).
[The current map covers the period 17 Aug-11 Oct 2006. - Mod.AS]
2. Situation assessment and commentary
2.1 Intra-Community trade
The affected member states have implemented EU rules for disease control.
These measures are designed to mitigate the risk of the disease spreading
by legal trade in live susceptible animals and their products.
Recent detections indicate that the disease has spread mainly eastwards
from the initially affected areas. However, some westward and, to a very
limited extent, southwards spread has also been noted.
Tests carried out on cattle and sheep imported from the affected EU Member
States to the UK since 1 Jul 2006 have given negative results. Therefore,
there is a low likelihood that the disease may have been introduced by
movement of domestic cattle or sheep prior to the detection of this
outbreak by any consignments from areas now under restriction. However, our
understanding of the epidemiology of the disease on the continent continues
to develop as new information comes forward. The need for further tracings
of imported susceptible animals is therefore continuing, subject to review.
2.2 Climatic conditions
One of possible ways that may contribute to the spread of the disease is by
insect vectors. Therefore, this assessment considers whether the
possibility of the chance windborne movement of the vector insects to the
UK over relatively long distances has been increased as a result of these
developments. Our previous assessment suggested that the likelihood of the
disease being introduced into the UK by infected windborne midges would
depend on weather conditions in the affected area adjacent to the UK.
When considering a possibility of the BTV being introduced to the UK by
competent vectors, 2 things should be taken into account. Firstly, whether
any midges are infected with the virus and the level of infection in the
midge population, and secondly, whether any infected midges could be
transported by wind to the UK.
To assess the possibility of whether insect vectors (regardless of whether
infected or not) might reach the UK, the meteorological conditions (wind
speed and direction) over the infected areas are being monitored by the Met
Office, UK, and the Institute for Animal Health, Pirbright, UK. The
possibility of local area spread in the currently affected member states
appears to be likely, although detailed modelling is required to confirm this.
With regard to assessing the risk of vector insects arriving from the
currently affected areas to the UK, a worst-case scenario scheme was
designed and used for the period 1 Jul 2006 to date (Gloster J. - personal
communication by email, September 2006). As the number of infected midges
is unknown a standard release of model particles has been assumed and as
such the modelling results must be treated with caution. A worst-case
scenario based on midges becoming airborne at Oostende on the Belgium coast
where no outbreaks have so far been recorded suggests that the overall risk
to the UK remained very low during September. Nevertheless, this again
highlights importance of maintaining high vigilance in the areas of the UK
considered to be at risk.
Nevertheless, the meteorological conditions are being assessed on a daily
basis and the output is being forwarded to Defra on a regular basis for the
ongoing assessment of the risk.
3. Conclusions
The outbreaks of BTV-8 in the affected areas of the Netherlands, Belgium,
Germany and France are a significant development in the epidemiology of the
disease in the EU. This type of the BT virus has never been recorded before
in Europe. Further developments are likely to continue and new cases may be
reported in the currently affected areas.
It is unlikely that infected competent adult vectors will survive the
winter. However, should the BT virus manage to survive either in a vector
or a susceptible host over the winter period, then fresh outbreaks may be
expected next year when the population of adult vectors begin to rise.
Although recent developments suggest an incremental increase of the risk of
BT introduction to the UK, the overall risk is currently considered to be
low. A low possibility of the introduction of the virus by infected midges
being blown to the UK still exists, however, this is expected to decline
further as temperatures and vector populations decline with the start of
the autumn/winter period.
IAHD continues to monitor developments and re-assess the situation.

[The infected continental territories closest to the UK are situated in
Belgium. As apparent from the Belgian statistics, the disease is still
spreading there and seems not to have peaked yet; see graph at
