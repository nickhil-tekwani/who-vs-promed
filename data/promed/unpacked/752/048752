A 10-year study conducted by the University of Wyoming and the Wyoming Game and Fish Department suggests that the effects of chronic wasting disease (CWD) on elk populations may not be as devastating as once believed.

Research has shown that genes play a role in elk susceptibility to CWD. Some elk have genes that prolong the time between exposure to the CWD prion, the infectious agent of CWD, and the onset of the disease. These genes become dominant over many decades, greatly reducing the impact of CWD on the population. Elk with these genes live longer even when heavily exposed to CWD and therefore have more opportunity to reproduce than elk with other genes.

Some people have feared that winter feedgrounds for elk would concentrate the disease resulting in much higher incidence of CWD.

"This study model essentially represents the worst-case scenario that would face feedground elk," said Dr Terry Kreeger, retired state wildlife veterinarian for the Wyoming Game and Fish Department. "We predict a genetic shift over several decades favoring genes that prolong the incubation time of CWD resulting in elk populations that are able to persist in the face of the disease."

Scott Edberg, deputy chief of the Wyoming Game and Fish Wildlife Division states: "It helps to know that based on this research, if CWD should become established on feedgrounds, we won't see a devastating effect on populations as many have feared. This research also looked at how hunting would affect populations, and it appears, Game and Fish would still need to have hunting seasons to manage elk populations even if faced with CWD on feedgrounds."

Abstract
--------
As the area where chronic wasting disease (CWD) has been found continues to expand, there is concern over the impact it may have on elk (_Cervus elaphus_) populations that congregate on winter feedgrounds in Wyoming. A stochastic simulation model was created to determine the effect that genotype-specific CWD mortality rates had on a hypothetical free-ranging elk population. Life table data gathered from captive elk held in a CWD-contaminated facility was used to parameterize the model. Modeling the free-ranging elk herd without hunting or differences in survival by genotype resulted in a near extinction decrease in elk numbers over a 100 year period. However, incorporating differences in CWD-mortality by genotype into the model allowed the population to stabilize if hunting was modified to harvest only antlered elk. Our results indicate that, with flexible hunting management, elk populations could adapt to CWD through changes in the frequency of genotypes associated with the incubation time for CWD.

[There is a discussion of this paper in the Jackson Hole News & Guide at http://www.jhnewsandguide.com/news/environmental/cwd-won-t-wipe-out-elk-herds-study-says/article_f9a57921-a86a-5e3e-890f-a4f129f60f40.html

Time will tell how this observation will impact control. With a longer incubation period it means that, on the useful side, some incubating elk will be shot before developing the disease, thereby removing them from the infected pool. On the other hand, it means that surveillance has to be significantly lengthened in order to hope to catch the late presenters. - Mod.MHJ
