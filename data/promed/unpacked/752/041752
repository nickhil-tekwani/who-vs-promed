The government of Daegu City says a case of avian influenza (AI) detected [Wed 21 Jun 2017] has been confirmed as a highly pathogenic strain.

The infected chicken was being kept in a makeshift pen in Dong District before being tested by the Animal and Plant Quarantine Agency.

Daegu says it is strengthening quarantine measures to prevent the spread of bird flu, including a transport ban on poultry, more checkpoints, and strengthened disinfection services.

The city has culled 725 birds bred in 7 farms within the 3-kilometer radius from where the infected chicken was found.
