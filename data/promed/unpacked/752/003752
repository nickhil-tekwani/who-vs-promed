An infectious hazard of playing soldiers: outbreak of _Salmonella java_
infection associated with a paintball event
----------------------------------------------------------
All ten cases of _Salmonella java_ phage type (PT) 1 variant 3 identified
in England and Wales since the end of April 1998 attended an outdoor
pursuit centre in southern England between 19 April and 17 May. Eight took
part in a 'paintball event' on 17 May. In a paintball event, two teams
dress in combat gear and run through woodland shooting 'paint' capsules at
each other. The winning team is the one hit with the fewest paint marks.
Preliminary interviews suggest over 40 of the 207 people who attended
subsequently became unwell. Three potential risk factors - eating spit
roasted pork (hog roast), drinking water (perhaps untreated), and
accidental ingestion of the paintballs themselves (made from gelatin and
animal fat and stained with food colouring) - are being investigated among
the cohort who attended on that day.
Preliminary analysis of data from a retrospective cohort study being
performed using a postal questionnaire has shown that many ate pork (hog
roast). The environmental investigation showed that the apparatus used to
roast the pork (a whole pig) might not have heated the inner parts to a
safe temperature and that the pig was stored at room temperature for up to
38 hours before being cooked.
_S. java_ PT 1 var 3 is rare in England and Wales (19 isolates in 1997).
Isolates of _S. java_ have previously been reported from reptiles and
tropical fish in England and Scotland.

[I'd say it's unlikely 40 people swallowed paintballs, unless they taste
that good. The conclusion should be not to give up paint-balling, but to
roast your whole pig properly - Mod.JW]
