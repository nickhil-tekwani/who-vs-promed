This summer, a brucellosis infection was suspected in this country, both in a domestic dog and in dogs in an isolation center. Such an infection has never been confirmed in Iceland, and therefore the matter was taken seriously by the Food Agency. Subsequently, measures were taken to prevent the spread of infection while the case was investigated. In light of the results obtained through extensive sample testing and expert advice, the agency has decided to lift the aforementioned restrictions.

Brucella infection, [caused by] _Brucella canis_, can cause inflammation of the testicles in males and miscarriage in bitches. Puppies can also be born stillborn or weak. Although rare, people can also become infected with the bacteria. The risk of infection is greatest during littering in infected bitches and physical contact with fetal membranes and dead or sick puppies.

After repeated sampling and testing, all but one of the dogs in the isolation center have been tested negative and discharged from isolation. Since the results of the examination of the previous samples were not considered reliable enough, new samples will be taken from one dog that is still in isolation.

There has been a lot of discussion in neighboring countries recently about infections caused by _B. canis_, but the number of cases seems to be increasing. Although _B. canis_ has never been confirmed in dogs in Iceland, it cannot be ruled out that it is hidden or was present at some point, because the infection is such that there are often few or no clinical symptoms. In light of this, the Food Agency is now examining the possibility of conducting a general survey of the antibody status against this bacterium in dogs in the country in the near future.

MAST encourages veterinarians and dog owners, especially breeders, to be alert for symptoms that may indicate brucellosis infection and to contact MAST if suspicions arise.

[According to the above news release by Iceland's State Food and Veterinary Authority, the potential infection in the local dog, which presumably occurred in July 2022 (ProMED post 20220728.8704734), remains to be confirmed or otherwise. Conclusive results of its retesting, possibly involving an international reference laboratory for brucellosis in animals, are awaited. In case confirmed, this will become Iceland's 1st case of _Brucella canis_, expected to be reported to WOAH as such. - Mod.AS
