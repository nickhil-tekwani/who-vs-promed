A disease which can kill large numbers of salmon and trout has been
discovered at a fish farm in Devon.

[Renibacteriosis d.t. _Renibacterium salmoninaruum_] Bacterial Kidney
Disease (BKD) was found in a trout sample during a routine monitoring visit
to the Waldon Fish Farm at Thornbury near Holsworthy. The source of the
outbreak is being investigated by government inspectors.

Defra has issued an order, under the Diseases of Fish Act 1937, prohibiting
the movement of any fish or eggs into or out of the infected area. Defra
says the disease has no implications for human health. Senior inspector Dr.
Kevin Denham said there was no risk to members of the public who may have
eaten infected fish from the farm in Devon. He told BBC News: "A management
program has been agreed which will allow fish to be moved within the
protected area and disinfection to be carried out without the need for a
mass cull." Dr. Denham said 10 cases of BKD had been detected in 260 fish
farms in England and Wales this year [2006]. He said it represented a big
increase on previous figures, but was probably explained because inspectors
were actively looking for the disease.

BKD, which is notifiable under EU law, normally occurs only sporadically in
Britain. Fish infected with the disease may display a number of symptoms,
including protruding eyes, a swollen abdomen, pale anemic gills and
hemorrhaging at the base of the gills.

Anyone suspicious of a possible outbreak of BKD is being asked to
immediately contact the Fish Health Inspectorate in Weymouth.

[_Renibacterium salmoninarum_, an intracellular pathogen with salmonid
macrophages, is the cause of bacterial kidney disease (BKD), a chronic,
debilitating disease with high mortality, which is characterized by
granulomatous lesions, primarily on the kidney and other organs. The
disease occurs worldwide in cultured and wild salmon. BKD affects the
health, fitness and survival of salmonids at all life stages during both
fresh and saltwater phases. In the Pacific Northwest Columbia River
drainage and estuary, it is a serious problem in cultured broodstocks of
endangered chinook and sockeye salmon and hatchery raised fish. Currently,
there are no vaccines available to prevent _R. salmoninarum_ infections,
and antibiotic treatment has also proven less than optimal.
