I would like to comment on the Article "Tuberculosis, MDR, Airplane
Exposure - Multicountry (03)" in ProMED Digest 373, 2007.
The comment needs some clarification: The number of air exchanges
within the aircraft is around 20 per hour (in public buildings 5 per
hour). The number of exchanges does not depend on whether flying
First, Business, or Economy Class, and the number of air exchanges
has not been reduced to save fuel. Around 50 percent of air used for
ventilation of the aircraft cabin is re-circulated. For re-circulated
air, so-called HEPA (High Efficiency Particulate Filters) are used to
achieve elimination of particles and biological agents (3).
Furthermore, the relative humidity inside the aircraft cabin is
between about 5 and 15 percent, thus reducing the infectivity of germs.
First, some words concerning general risk of infection aboard: Due to
the peculiarities of cabin pressurization and climate, the chance for
transmission of infectious agents aboard is almost nil and only
possible with direct contact and small distance to the infected
person. Nevertheless, to minimize the remaining minute risk and to
prevent harming the infected passengers, these persons are excluded
from air travel.
With regard to about 5 million passengers per day and more than 2
billion per year, the number of infections transmitted during flights
is surprisingly low (5). In a bacteriological study, no increased
concentrations of germs could be detected aboard passenger aircraft;
the concentrations were similar to those in terminals and outside.
The risk of transmission of infections was lower than with other
means of transport, e.g. traveling by bus (13). There are no data
showing that flight attendants are infected by passengers (4). The
re-circulated air does not cause an increase in upper respiratory
infections (14). The risk of infection for passengers is negligible
and is much lower than at the destinations (4).
Tuberculosis can serve as a model for droplet respiratory aerogeneous
infections aboard aircraft. Most research articles deal with it (5).
A theoretical risk of infection exists, according to WHO guidelines,
after prolonged contact with an index case with open tuberculosis in
the immediate vicinity after flights of at least 8 hours (11).
Diseases like meningococcal meningitis etc. are dealt with similarly.
Several studies show that after flights of index patients with open
tuberculosis, there were either no secondary infections (1; 7), or
secondary infections were very unlikely (1; 8; 9). The rare cases of
transmission were related to special circumstances, like prolonged,
close contact (2; 6; 12). There were no secondary infections -- as
indicated by radiological abnormalities or conversion of the skin
test -- of 48 pilots having flown with a colleague with open
tuberculosis, even though the seats are located very close together
and there was prolonged exposure. _M. tuberculosis_ is not
transmitted by the air condition on board or the re-circulated air
(6). The risk of acquiring tuberculosis aboard an aircraft equals
that in school busses, ships, bars or hospitals (10); it is relatively low (6).
In summary, the risk of infection, including that of tuberculosis,
aboard aircraft is low.

[We thank Joerg Siedenburg for his thoughtful comments. The risk of
transmission is related to the infectiousness of the person with
tuberculosis, the duration of exposure, the proximity to the source
person, and the ventilation. Indeed, of the 6 investigations reported
by the U.S. CDC
<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00036502.htm> following
exposure of others traveling on the same aircraft to persons with
infectious pulmonary TB (that is, a symptomatic patient with
acid-fast bacillus smear-positive cavitary pulmonary TB),
transmission of _M. tuberculosis_ is known to have occurred only on 2
occasions: once from a flight attendant to other flight crew, and
once from a passenger to other passengers seated in close proximity
on a flight of more than 8 hours duration. These exposures resulted,
fortunately, only in tuberculin skin test conversions, not active
tuberculosis at the time of the investigations; but because of this
disease's long latency, active tuberculosis may ultimately develop in
some of these tuberculin converters. If the exposed passengers had
the additional misfortune of being immunocompromised (for example by
HIV infection or immunosuppressive medication for auto-immune disease
or organ transplantation), the outcome could be much worse. - Mod.ML]
