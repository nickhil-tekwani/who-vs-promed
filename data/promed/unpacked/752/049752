Marine scientists have identified the herpes-type virus responsible for the
deaths of thousands of pilchards along the South Australian coast. SA
Fisheries director Gary Morgan said yesterday the discovery, which confirms
for the first time that a virus is responsible for this month's fish kill.
The virus identification was made at the Australian Animal Health
Laboratories in Geelong at the weekend. Dr Morgan said the scientists wanted
to develop a DNA probe which would enable them to check whether the virus
was dormant in healthy fish, or whether imported pilchards or ballast water
from foreign ships carried the virus.
"Everywhere else that pilchards are farmed we see these same types of mass
fatalities," Dr Morgan told AAP. "Up to now it's been almost recognised as
an act of God. But I would suggest the finger of suspicion would be pointed
very strongly at the virus now. If indeed other fish kills around the world
can now be traced back to the same type of virus or similar virus, it gives
us an explanation of why these things happen."
The virus is the same virus detected in dead pilchards at the end of the
1995 pilchard kill, when tens of thousands of tonnes of pilchards died in
waters stretching from WA along the southern and eastern coasts to New
Zealand. But Dr Morgan said the virus was found only at the end of the 1995
kill and could not be properly isolated.
The latest kill, which began about two weeks ago in the Spencer Gulf, has
spread to about 40km east of the Murray Mouth and 60km west of Ceduna on the
state's west coast. There are recent reports today of dead pilchards washed
up on the beaches around the South Australia/Western Australia border in the
first indication that the kill had spread into another state.
