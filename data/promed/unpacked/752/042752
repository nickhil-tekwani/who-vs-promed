[In a previous post: "Are we seeing the occasional case at the end of
outbreak, or does the continuing occurrence of new cases indicate a more
worrisome situation?"
A total of 500 pigs on a farm in the Catalan town of Segarra have been
killed as a precautionary measure because of possible classical swine fever
(CSF). The farm was a dangerous contact for the recent confirmed outbreak
in Penelles. If samples from the Segarra pigs are positive for CSF, there
will be further restrictions on transport of pigs.
