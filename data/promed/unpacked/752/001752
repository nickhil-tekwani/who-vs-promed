A die-off of birds killed by botulism has been reported along Lake
Michigan in Mackinac and Schoolcraft counties, and researchers are

[This is likely not the same outbreak as the ProMED-mail post
20071103.3572. The location mentioned in that particular post was
Antrim county, a 2-county separation. Mackinac County is on the upper
peninsula of Michigan, while Antrim county is in the lower portion of
the state, but certainly within the northern region.
