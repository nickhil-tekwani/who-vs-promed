[Ref: M Mnari-Hattab et al (2014): First report of severe yellowing outbreaks on tomato in Tunisia associated with _Tomato chlorosis virus_ infection. New Disease Reports 30, 3; DOI: 10.5197/j.2044-0588.2014.030.003]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
In Tunisia, tomato (_Solanum lycopersicum_) is the most widely cultivated all year-round vegetable crop. Since 2011 abnormal yellowing symptoms have been observed on field grown tomato crops in Kairouan [governorate], a major growing area in Tunisia. These symptoms were uniformly distributed within the fields. However at the end of the growing season it was difficult to distinguish between the yellowing symptoms, and the effects of senescence and other diseases. Initially the yellowing symptoms were confused with physiological and nutritional disorders as has often occurred.

Monitoring of tomato crops early in the 2014 season revealed severe yellowing on some plants randomly distributed in the field. The symptoms consisted of a uniform light green colouration of affected plants with interveinal chlorosis on individual leaves coalescing into chlorotic mottling on middle-aged leaves. Mature leaves thickened and became brittle and developed intense interveinal chlorosis with some bronzing or brown necrotic flecks by the end of the growing season. Leaves with such symptoms were often infested with whiteflies thought to be _Bemisia tabaci_. The intensity, frequency and distribution of the yellowing disorder suggested that virus infection might be responsible particularly as _Tomato yellow leaf curl virus_ (TYLCV), _Tomato yellow leaf curl Sardinia virus_ (TYLCSV) and [their] parental recombinant genus _Begomovirus_ (family _Geminiviridae_), are widespread in the same area. The symptoms were similar to those documented for _Tomato infectious chlorosis virus_ (TICV) and _Tomato chlorosis virus_ (ToCV), both of which are whitefly-transmitted and have been reported to occur in other Mediterranean countries.

Leaf samples were collected from both symptomatic and symptomless plants. [RT-PCR] analysis revealed that TICV, which has already been documented as an emerging virus in tomato and artichoke in Tunisia was present in 6/20 of symptomatic samples. However, 16/20 and 41/44 symptomatic samples collected in 2013 and 2014, respectively, generated amplicons corresponding to ToCV. No amplicons were produced with extracts from symptomless samples. Nucleotide sequences of 4 Tunisian isolates shared 99.1 to 100 percent identity and shared more than 99.5 percent identity with that of a ToCV isolate from Italy.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the 1st report of ToCV in Tunisian tomato crops, which is still considered a quarantine organism in Tunisia. Although we found the virus in a major production region of the country, its distribution is likely to be wider, since the symptoms cannot be distinguished unambiguously from those of mineral deficiency and or physiological disorders.

[_Tomato chlorosis virus_ (ToCV; genus _Crinivirus_) has been reported from Europe and a number of locations in other parts of the world. Besides tomato, it can also affect capsicum and some solanaceous weeds which may serve as pathogen reservoirs, as well as some ornamental and weed species in other families. Symptoms on tomato leaves include irregular chlorotic mottle, interveinal yellowing, necrotic flecks, and possible distortions. No obvious symptoms develop on fruit and flowers, but fruit size and numbers are reduced due to a loss of photosynthetic area. Significant yield losses occur as a result, but symptom severity varies with host cultivars. Symptoms may be confused with nutritional problems and are also similar to those of the related _Tomato infectious chlorosis virus_ (TICV) of the same genus.

ToCV is transmitted by a number of whitefly vectors, including _Bemisia tabaci_ and outbreaks are usually associated with high vector populations. Whiteflies are a serious pest in themselves and have also been reported to transmit over 100 virus species. Multiple infections with viruses sharing these vectors (as described above for coinfection of ToCV and TICV) are not unusual and may result in symbiotic enhancement of symptoms (synergism) of the co-infecting viruses.

Control of whitefly transmitted viruses is particularly difficult in open field crops due to the widespread presence and wide host range of whiteflies. Disease management of management of these viruses is difficult and includes vector control, removal of reservoirs of both virus and vectors, use of crop varieties with increased pathogen tolerance, and clean planting material.
