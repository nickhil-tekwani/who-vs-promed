[There is a correction of this report: Anthrax - China (02): (NX) livestock, human, travel alert, corr. 20180510.5790915

The article below incorrectly reports the spread of anthrax to Yinchuan city. It has been learned that the 2 victims from Sanhezhen (out of the 3 total discussed in the report below) were actually moved to the hospital in Yinchuan City for treatment, thus generating the incorrect report that anthrax had spread to another location. Our apologies for the error. - Mod.JH]

Russia recently issued a travel alert for citizens planning to visit China: there has been an outbreak of anthrax in central China. Russia's daily newspaper Kommersant reported on [2 May 2018] that the country's Consumer Protection and Public Welfare Supervision Bureau warned travelers to exercise caution if they are visiting areas of central China.

China's state-run China News Service reported on [17 Apr 2018] that 3 Chinese farmers in Haiyuan county, in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region of central China, were infected with anthrax and hospitalized between [11 and 13 Apr 2018]. One victim, from the Qiying township [Qiyingzhen], died at the hospital. The report said that the Qiying farmer was infected and sent to the hospital after killing a sick cow. The other 2 victims, farmers from Sanhez town [Sanhezhen], were infected after killing a sick goat. The farmers are suspected to have contracted anthrax from the infected animals.

Radio Free Asia reported on [17 Apr 2018] that the Chinese communist authorities announced the outbreak is now under control.

However, on [18 Apr 2018], citizens of Yinchuan City posted onto WeChat, a popular Chinese social media platform, that the anthrax outbreak had spread to their city -- the capital of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region -- about 140 miles [225 km] from Haiyuan county.

Anthrax is a life-threatening infectious disease caused by the bacterium _Bacillus anthracis_, usually transmitted from animals, especially ruminants such as cattle, goats, camels, and horses. Humans can be infected by directly or indirectly coming into contact with infected animals' skin, fur, or meat.

Symptoms begin between one day and 2 months after the infection. The infected skin will form a small blister with surrounding swelling that often turns into a painless ulcer with a black center.

[We must thank our Russian colleagues for reporting this outbreak with human cases in Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region of central China. As contaminated meat from privately butchered animals is at worst sold in a street market in the nearest next town, it is safe to assume that the human cases in the regional capital city of Yinchuan arose from another outbreak, and the awareness of the 1st encouraged reporting of the 2nd. There will now be others reported. As can be appreciated, China suffers from a universal under-reporting of this disease.
