In July 2012, the Kansas Department of Wildlife, Parks and Tourism (KDWPT) reported that 9 deer had tested positive for chronic wasting disease (CWD) during the 2011-2012 testing period. The agency now reports that the National Veterinary Services Laboratory in Ames, Iowa, after 2 different tests, did not detect CWD prions in the Sumner County deer, so initial testing in this case yielded a false-positive result. This reduces the total 2011-2012 positives to 8. Counties where CWD was detected during the 2011-2012 surveillance period include Wallace (1), Rawlins (1), Decatur (1), Norton (2), Trego (1), Ford (1), and Stafford (1).

The white-tailed deer in question was taken from Sumner County last winter [2011-2012]. This result brings the total number of confirmed CWD cases in Kansas to 48 since testing began in 1996. In total, 2446 animals were tested for CWD during the 2011-2012 surveillance period, 1 Aug 2011, through 31 Jul 2012.

Annual testing is part of an ongoing effort by KDWPT to monitor the prevalence and spread of CWD. The fatal disease was first detected in the Kansas free-ranging deer herd in 2005 in Cheyenne County.

More information on CWD can be found on KDWPT's website [http://ksoutdoors.com/news/content/download/10235/54459/file/Chronic%20Wasting%20Disease%20(CWD).pdf], or at the Chronic Wasting Disease Alliance website, http://www.cwd-info.org.

[Based upon the information here, it would appear that Sumner County did not have any deer positive for CWD. This is a small victory for the state and for the cervid producers. Hopefully, this news means there has not been a spread of CWD. CWD is disease that has no respect for county lines or the wishes of any producer or agency, but nevertheless, one less county is a small sign of hope.
