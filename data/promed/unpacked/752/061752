New Ebola outbreak declared in Democratic Republic of the Congo: Ebola DRC -- WHO outbreak response strategy
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo declared a new outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in Bikoro in Equateur province [Tue 8 May 2018; see ProMED Ebola update (02): Congo DR (ET) 20180508.5789723].

The Ministry of Health of Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) informed WHO that 2 out of 5 samples collected from 5 patients tested positive for EVD at the Institut National de Recherche Biomedicale (INRB) in Kinshasa. More specimens are being collected for testing.

WHO is working closely with the Government of the DRC to rapidly scale up its operations and mobilize health partners using the model of a successful response to a similar EVD outbreak in 2017.

"Our top priority is to get to Bikoro to work alongside the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and partners to reduce the loss of life and suffering related to this new Ebola virus disease outbreak," said Dr Peter Salama, WHO Deputy Director-General, Emergency Preparedness and Response. "Working with partners and responding early and in a coordinated way will be vital to containing this deadly disease."

The 1st multidisciplinary team comprised of experts from WHO, Medecins Sans Frontieres and Provincial Division of Health travelled today [8 May 2018] to Bikoro to strengthen coordination and investigations.

Bikoro is situated in Equateur province on the shores of Lake Tumba in the northwestern part of the country, near the Republic of the Congo. All cases were reported from ilkoko Iponge [Ikoko Impenge] health facility located about 30 kilometres [about 19 mi] from Bikoro. Health facilities in Bikoro have very limited functionality, and rely on international organizations to provide supplies that frequently stock out.

"We know that addressing this outbreak will require a comprehensive and coordinated response. WHO will work closely with health authorities and partners to support the national response. We will gather more samples, conduct contact tracing, engage the communities with messages on prevention and control, and put in place methods for improving data collection and sharing," said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, the WHO Regional Director for Africa.

This is DRC's 9th outbreak of EVD since the discovery of the virus in the country in 1976. In the past 5 weeks, there have been 21 suspected viral haemorrhagic fever in and around the ilkoko Iponge, including 17 deaths.

"WHO is closely working with other partners, including Médecins Sans Frontières, to ensure a strong, response to support the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo to prevent and control the spreading of the disease from the epicentre of ilkoko Iponge Health Zone to save lives," said Dr Allarangar Yokouide, WHO Representative in the DRC.

Upon learning about the laboratory results today [8 May 2018], WHO set up its Incident Management System to fully dedicate staff and resources across the organization to the response. WHO plans to deploy epidemiologists, logisticians, clinicians, infection prevention and control experts, risk communications experts and vaccination support teams in the coming days. WHO will also be determining supply needs and help fill gaps, such as for Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). WHO has also alerted neighbouring countries.

WHO released USD 1 million from its Contingency Fund for Emergencies to support response activities for the next 3 months with the goal of stopping the spread of Ebola to surrounding provinces and countries.

Building on the 2017 response
-----------------------------
Ebola is endemic to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The last Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo occurred in 2017 in Likati Health Zone, Bas Uele Province, in the northern part of the country and was quickly contained thanks to joint efforts by the Government of DRC, WHO and many different partners.

An effective response to the 2017 EVD outbreak was achieved through the timely alert by local authorities of suspect cases, immediate testing of blood samples due to strengthened national laboratory capacity, the early announcement of the outbreak by the government, rapid response activities by local and national health authorities with the robust support of international partners, and speedy access to flexible funding.

Coordination support on the ground by WHO was critical and an Incident Management System was set up within 24 hours of the outbreak being announced. WHO deployed more than 50 experts to work closely with government and partners.

The Ebola virus causes an acute, serious illness, which is often fatal if untreated. The average EVD case fatality rate is around 50 percent. The virus is transmitted to people from wild animals and spreads in the human population through human-to-human transmission.

At least 17 people have died in the northwest of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where health officials have confirmed an outbreak of Ebola, the health ministry has said.

It is the 9th time Ebola has been recorded in the DRC, whose eastern Ebola river gave the deadly virus its name when it was discovered there in the 1970s, and the outbreak comes less than a year after one that killed 8 people.

The health ministry said: "Our country is facing another epidemic of the Ebola virus, which constitutes an international public health emergency.

"We still dispose of the well-trained human resources that were able to rapidly control previous epidemics."

Ebola is believed to be spread over long distances by bats, which can host the virus without dying, as they infect other animals with which they share trees, such as monkeys. Ebola often spreads to humans via infected bushmeat. ...

After DRC's previous Ebola flare-up, authorities approved the use of a new experimental vaccine, but in the end did not deploy it owing to logistical challenges and the relatively minor nature of the outbreak.

Despite regular outbreaks every few years, death tolls in the DRC have been significantly lower.

[ProMED thanks rapporteur Mary Marshall <mjm2020@googlemail.com>, and Gabby Molinolo (iJET International <gabriela.molinolo@gmail.com>) for submitting reports on this latest Ebola virus outbreak.

The timely and comprehensive response by the DRC Provincial Division of Health, WHO, and MSF gives hope control of this latest outbreak will be rapidly achieved. Activating the Incident Management System and immediate release of funds from the Contingency Fund for Emergencies should facilitate an effective response.

It will be interesting to see whether the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine will be deployed in this outbreak. Development of the vaccine began in the 1990s and early 2000s. It is based on a live replicating vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), which was genetically modified to express a surface glycoprotein of _Zaire ebolavirus_ (VSV-EBOV).

A phase 3 trial in 2015 using a ring vaccination protocol in Guinea indicated that the vaccine appeared to be "highly efficacious and safe." The protocol was to vaccinate all the closest contacts of new cases of Ebola infection either immediately or after 21 days. In December 2016, the VSV-EBOV vaccine was demonstrated to be 95-100 percent effective against the Ebola virus, making it the 1st proven vaccine against the disease.
