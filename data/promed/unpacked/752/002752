[So far, these outbreaks are restricted to ferret badgers. Ferret badgers are a species of the mustelid family included in the _Melogale_ genus. The Formosan ferret badger (_Melogale moschata subaurantiaca_) is a subspecies of the Chinese ferret badger (_M. moschata_) that only occurs in Taiwan. It is reported to be an agile climber and often sleeps curled up on tree branches. Ferret badgers are omnivorous and live in burrows or crevices and are active at dusk and at night.
