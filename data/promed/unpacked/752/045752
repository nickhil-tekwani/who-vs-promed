The discovery of a rabid puppy in Toronto is the latest case of a
brain-wrecking disease that has spooked thousands of people in Ontario,
although the last death in the province was a 4 year old girl bitten by a
fox in Richmond, near Ottawa, in 1987.
In the city, bats, not dogs, have been found to be the main species
carrying rabies, which is spread by saliva.
In 2006, the latest year for which statistics are available, 1987 Ontarians
-- including 280 in Toronto -- received preventive rabies vaccination shots
after being bitten by animals they feared might have rabies. The province's
total in 2006 was a 30 per cent jump over the 1526 who got the 6-shot
treatment in 2005.
In spite of the rising numbers, the good news is that the biggest threat --
raccoon rabies -- is so far being contained far from the city. There were
82 rabid animals found in Ontario in 2006, including 42 bats, 23 skunks, 11
head of cattle and one sheep, with the domestic animals usually being
infected by a fox or bat.
Toronto Public Health in 2006 sent 87 dead animals for testing by the
Canadian Food Inspection Agency. Five of them -- all bats -- tested
rabies-positive. Many of those people getting the vaccine in Toronto,
however, were bitten by dogs and cats that were not their own pets. There
were no proven cases of dog rabies in Ontario that year, although there
were 2 cases of rabid cats.
The greater Toronto region, however, has been spared raccoon rabies, thanks
to a USD 9 million bait dropping program run by the Ontario Ministry of
Natural Resources. It was launched after the 1st rabid raccoon crossed the
international bridge from Ogdensburg, NY to the Prescott area in 1999. The
infected animals began spreading westward.
The ministry estimates there are 1.1 million raccoons in the province.
While there is no reliable estimate for the number in Toronto, the ministry
found in a survey that there is an average of 12 raccoons per square km in
the countryside, compared with 52 in ravine-laced, garbage-rich Toronto.
From 2000 to 2006, there have been 132 cases of raccoon rabies in Eastern
Ontario. Today, there are 2 front lines of the raccoon rabies war: the
Gananoque-Brockville area and the Buffalo-Niagara river divide. "Our whole
program is premised on the thesis that if the population of raccoons is
vaccinated, it cannot spread," said Dr Chris Davies, manager of the
ministry's wildlife research section.
Ontario has assembled a quick-reaction team to deal with any new outbreak.
It can blanket an area with 1000 live traps within 24 hours once a case of
raccoon rabies has been proved. All raccoons within a 5 km radius are
killed by lethal injection. Those live-trapped within a 2nd 5 km circle are
vaccinated and released. A 3rd concentric circle is baited with sachets of
marshmallow-flavored vaccine.

[This article clearly indicates that the wildlife people are taking action
to control raccoon rabies, including with oral rabies vaccine. But the
following is a telling statement: "While there is no reliable estimate for
the number in Toronto, the ministry found in a survey that there is an
average of 12 raccoons per square km in the countryside, compared with 52
in ravine-laced, garbage-rich Toronto."
These animals are moving into the city, where food is easy to find and
because they face a dwindling of their own habitat as cities and towns
grow, a phenomenon happening all over the globe. But it clearly bears out
the message that all pets need to be vaccinated against rabies. - Mod.TG]
