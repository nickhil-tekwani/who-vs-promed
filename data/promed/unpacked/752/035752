Health authorities around the world are on alert as registered cases of krokodil use rise. Krokodil is a low-cost drug whose effects are similar to those of heroin, but its use leads to a long and painful death. After the 1st cases of addiction to krokodil were detected in October 2013 in Illinois and Arizona, health authorities of the state of Sonora in Mexico have confirmed the 1st case of addiction to the "drug of the living dead" on Mexican soil.

According to information published by Proceso, the 1st officially confirmed case of krokodil use has been registered in Nogales, a city on the border with Arizona in the United States.

According to Proceso, state authorities reported that an older man showed up at a Residential Mutual Help Center. When he received medical attention, it was confirmed that he had all the symptoms associated with krokodil, one of the most lethal drugs nowadays. The injuries it generates cause the skin to die and rot.

The director of the Mental Health Service of Sonora, Leticia Amparano Gamez, told the Mexican media that the man, who is also addicted to meth, cocaine and heroin, has received medical help and is under observation: "We're treating him and working, hoping it won't branch out and more consumers show up," Gamez said, quoted by Proceso.

The new report comes days after another case of krokodil addiction was detected in a 17 year old girl from Houston, Texas. According to The Latin Times, the girl was visiting the tourist city of Puerto Vallarta in Mexico to visit her family last November [2013]. Later, the girl was interned at a hospital where she received treatment due to injuries in her genitals. The doctors treating the girl thought it was an advanced cased of an STD due to the "serious lacerations" she presented. However, shortly after, the girl admitted to injecting krokodil into her genitals.

In early 2005, the drug became popular among Russian addicts to due to its low cost and similar effects to heroin. According to Time, in 2005, Russia's drug enforcement agency sporadically reported seizing the drug; however, by 2011, Russia had seized 65 million doses, and Russia's government estimates that at least a million people are addicted to krokodil. Prolonged used of Krokodil produces necrosis wherever it is injected. The skin rots and falls off, exposing bones.

[Desomorphine is an opioid analog with a chemical structure similar to morphine. The structural differences produce a more rapid onset and shorter duration of action than morphine.

Clandestine manufacture of desomorphine involves 2 steps: the extraction of codeine from pharmaceutical products, followed by the synthesis of desomorphine from the codeine. The extraction of codeine involves mixing the codeine source (which often contains acetaminophen and other substances) with organic solvents such as gasoline, adding a strong base such as lye, and then adding an acidic solution such as hydrochloric acid to produce water soluble codeine salts that will reside in the aqueous layer. The codeine can be further extracted, but many will proceed directly with the next step. The extracted codeine is mixed with iodine, hydrochloric acid, and red phosphorus to reduce the codeine to desocodeine. Subsequently the desocodeine is demethylated into desomorphine in a one-pot synthesis that may take 45 minutes. There are some reports of attempts at neutralization at the end of the reaction using cigarette ash or sodium bicarbonate. Despite these efforts, the solution is often quite acidic with a pH less than 3 [1]. Analysis of Russian samples shows that what is purported to be desomorphine is often a sloppy mixture of 4 synthetic analogues of desomorphine, codeine, and other chemicals resulting from poor synthesis procedures. The actual desomorphine content of krokodil samples ranged from traces to 75 per cent [2].

Desomorphine has been shown to have a greater addictive potential than morphine [3]. The rapid onset of action produces an intense "rush" that is both pleasurable and drives many users to compulsively use and abuse the substance in a manner similar to heroin.

Repeated administration of any opiate can cause physical dependency, which requires increasing doses to produce the desired effect and a withdrawal syndrome if the substance is no longer taken.

Desomorphine, when produced in clandestine home labs, is notoriously impure and contaminated with toxic substances. Injection can cause immediate damage and destruction of skin, blood vessels, muscles, and bone. Iodine used in the synthesis process can cause thyroid and muscle damage. Phosphorus, also a contaminant, is known to damage cartilage.

The damaged tissue is susceptible to infection, which may lead to abscesses, inflammation, and destruction of the veins (thrombophlebitis), and death of the soft tissue. The constellation of related tissue damage has lead many media reports to refer to desomorphine as a "flesh eating" or "flesh rotting" drug [5,6]. Pure desomorphine itself is not known to cause these effects. Intravenous injection of street krokodil is also well known to cause life threatening blood stream infections, destruction of the heart valves, and death. Because desomorphine is short acting compared to morphine and heroin, the need for more frequent injection increases the risks of infection from hepatitis C virus and HIV [4].

As with most opioids, death can occur at high doses because of respiratory depression. Street desomorphine carries additional potentially fatal risks associated with injecting impure chemicals into the body.

This homemade concoction of fuel and narcotics literally eats the body from the inside out. The lesions appear to have no cure and are reported to be painful and devastating. The concoction is not pure and may not be homogenous, and in some cases those choosing to use the drug have injected straight fuel into the veins. Most people choosing to use this drug are dead inside of 2 years. The warning here is for people to know what they are doing and for parents to know about the lethal effects of this combination and to warn children, teens, and young adults.
