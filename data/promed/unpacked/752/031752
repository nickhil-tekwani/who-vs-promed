The Government of Amapa confirmed Wednesday [21 Jul 2021] one death from yellow fever in the city of Macapa. The patient was a 21-year-old man who was hospitalized at the Oswaldo Cruz State Emergency Hospital for several days.

The patient was admitted to the hospital with symptoms of abdominal pain and fever for 10 days, jaundice, and a flaccid and painful abdomen. After the suspicion of yellow fever was notified on 19 Jul [2021], the Central Laboratory of Amapa (Lacen/AP) performed RT-PCR, which confirmed the case Wednesday [21 Jul 2021].

"This case was probably acquired in a forest area in the region, as it is a disease that is closely linked to the entry of man into these environments, which is where the main vector is: the mosquito. So, probably the infection occurred in this situation," detailed Dorinaldo Malafaia, Superintendent of Health Surveillance of Amapa (SVS/AP).

Although the death occurred in Macapa, the young man was a resident of Rio Tambaqui do Vieira, in Afua ([Para state]), and worked in a sawmill, but he came to the capital of Amapa in search of medical care.

"This information has already been passed on to the municipality of Afua (PA), because this case is not local, it is imported; we must highlight this. Even though the hospitalization and death occurred in Macapa, the patient came from another municipality, so the infection was not found here. We communicated [with] the Health Surveillance of Afua, so that they can take the necessary measures and make the vaccine barrier in the region," he added.

After notification, Dorinaldo explained that the SVS seeks to know the path taken by the patient to track possible cases, even if vaccination coverage in the capital is efficient.

"We have excellent coverage. In recent years, we have been following an isolated case, last year [2020], in a mining region, but we cannot say whether it was part of Amapa or French Guiana. And now, this case imported from Afua. In the specific issue of Amapa, we have good control of the disease," concluded the superintendent.

In addition, in the municipality of Dona Emma, Santa Catarina state, 2 monkeys were found dead from yellow fever. According to the Department of Health, soon after the collection of the test and notification, the team has already carried out all the preventive work against the disease, making a vaccine blockade and an active search for the unvaccinated within a radius of 800 m [0.5 mi].

With this fact, concern grows in seeking out people who are not vaccinated, as the only form of protection against this disease is immunization, since yellow fever does not have specific treatment.

"The disappearance, death of monkeys, leaves us on alert, as they are victims like human beings, making us feel the presence of the virus close by," emphasized the technician Catia Fritz Batista Leite.

[Cases of sylvan (forest) yellow fever in humans and monkeys have been occurring in several states in Brazil this year (2021). Now Para state is added to the list with this man who apparently acquired his yellow fever virus infection in Para state but died in Amapa state in the far northeast of the country.

The above report indicates that monkeys died in Santa Catarina state in the southeast of Brazil. Yellow fever virus transmission has been active in Santa Catarina state this year (2021). Both human and monkey yellow fever cases have been occurring there. The number of human cases has increased, from 2 reported on 11 Mar 2021 (see Yellow fever - Americas (05): Brazil (SC) human, monkey 20210315.8247346) to 3, and then to 7 reported on 31 Apr 2021 (see Yellow fever - Americas (10): Brazil (SC) human 20210504.8342968). These human cases represent spillover from the sylvan (forest) transmission cycle. Fortunately, there has been no urban yellow fever transmission in Brazil since 1942. Increased surveillance is important to know where yellow fever virus transmission is taking place. People living in or visiting these localities should be vaccinated to avoid more human cases. - Mod.TY
