Equine Encephalitis in North Durham
-----------------------------------
A horse in North Durham, ON, has tested positive
for a rare West Nile-like virus which can be
contracted by humans, according to Durham Region Health Department.

The department confirmed last week [11-15 Aug
2008] that the horse had been infected with
eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) earlier this
month and died shortly afterward. The virus,
which mainly affects horses and some bird species
can be transmitted to humans via an infected
mosquito, similar to West Nile virus (WNV). The
signs of the 2 viruses are also similar, ranging
from a mild flu-like illness to coma and death.

"Although EEE is uncommon in Ontario and the risk
to humans is quite low, there have also been 2
positive tests for WNV in birds reported in
Durham Region this summer," said Dr. Monika Dutt,
Durham Region's Acting Medical Officer of Health.
"Therefore, it is important for everyone to
remember to take precautions to help reduce the
risk of being bitten by mosquitoes."

Although the mortality rate of EEE in humans is
approximately one-third according to the U.S.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),
the Ontario Ministry of Agriculture (M0H), Food
and Rural Affairs recorded only 2 cases (both in
horses) in the province in 2004. The CDC's
website also states that horses are 'dead-ends'
for the virus, meaning that transmission from
horses to humans via infected mosquitoes is
extremely rare, due to the small amount of the
virus found in equine bloodstreams.

The disease is most prevalent in swampy areas of
the continent, which provide a breeding ground
for the mosquitoes that transmit the virus.
According to Dr. Robert Kyle, Durham Region's
Medical Officer of Health, residents of North
Durham living in and around Lake Scugog are not
at increased risk level, since the mosquito which
transmits the disease from birds to humans (a
different species of mosquito carries the virus
from birds to horses) is indigenous to warmer
regions, such as the southern U.S.

A vaccine for horses is available. However,
residents are advised to take the following precautions:
 avoid areas with high mosquito populations;
 take precautions from dusk to dawn when mosquitoes are most active;
 use a mosquito repellent that contains DEET,
carefully following manufacturers' instructions;
 wear light-coloured clothing (mosquitoes are
attracted to darker colours), including long
sleeves, pants, socks and a hat to cover exposed skin;
 make sure all windows and doors in the home
have tight fitting screens and are in good condition; and
 get rid of stagnant water that remains for
more that a week around the outside of the home
to help eliminate potential breeding sites.

[The disease is seasonal, more often seen in the
southern US. The last time this disease reached
Canada was in 2003. Please see ProMED-mail post 20030826.2153 - Mod.TG]
