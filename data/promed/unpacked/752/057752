Transboundary cattle trafficking spreads disease
------------------------------------------------
About half of Southern Africa's 47 million cattle are under threat
from transboundary livestock diseases, despite improvements in
regional surveillance and management, a new study warns.
"Livestock, Food and Agricultural Statistics" was launched by the
Southern Africa Development Community (SADC) secretariat in Botswana
last month [June 2005].
The report examined regional livestock disease trends and found that
the major threats to livestock in the region were foot-and-mouth
disease (FMD) and Contagious Bovine Pleuropneumonia (CBPP); 4
countries were hit by severe flare-ups of CBPP in 2003.
Tanzania experienced 20 CBPP outbreaks, resulting in 125 cattle deaths, while
Zambia recorded 17 eruptions affecting 1165 cattle. Angola and Namibia also
suffered outbreaks of the disease in areas outside CBPP quarantine boundaries.
FMD was much more widespread in 2003/2004, reaching Tanzania, Malawi,
Mozambique, Zambia, Botswana and South Africa.
The report stressed that recurrences as well as new outbreaks of
diseases were still taking place, mainly as a result of uncontrolled
transboundary cattle [movement].
According to Parks and Wildlife disease surveillance officers in
Botswana, there was a brisk trade in live cattle, goats and donkeys
between communities living along the common border with Zimbabwe.
Illegal cross-border cattle trafficking had slowed down after
completion of an electric fence, which the authorities in Gaborone
said was aimed at reducing the entry and spread of animal diseases
from Zimbabwe's Hwange National Park.
But Zimbabwe's agriculture minister, Joseph Made, told IRIN that
although the country was experiencing serious outbreaks of FMD,
anthrax and rabies, he was not aware that it was acting as a conduit
for animal diseases to other countries. He said they were making
great efforts to contain the problem, but faced a shortage of funds
for buying the necessary vaccines.
"Zimbabwe treats only those diseases within its boundaries. I do not
know where the diseases go from here, but we are still doing all we
can to control what we have in our territory," Made noted.
However, the problem does not only lie with Zimbabwe and its
inability to contain eruptions of animal diseases.
"People from Botswana buy cheap domestic stock from Zambia and
Zimbabwe and drive them across the border without considering
quarantine boundaries. In that way CBPP, anthrax and FMD have been
brought into northern Botswana," said one surveillance officer. [see
comment].
"From Chobe National Park in Botswana it is much easier for big game
like buffalo to cross into Linyanti National Park in Northern
Namibia. A disease can be passed down from Zambia to Botswana and
Namibia via Zimbabwe -- that's how porous and vulnerable SADC
boundaries are," he commented.
Transboundary stock theft between communities in northern Zimbabwe
and their counterparts in southern Zambia also continued to fuel the
spread of animal diseases.

Trans-boundary diseases hamper livestock development
----------------------------------------------------
Trans-boundary animal diseases have marred developments in the livestock sector
in the Southern African region during 2003/2004, says a SADC annual report
released in Gaborone recently.
Contagious Bovine Pleuropneumonia
---------------------------------
According to the report, 4 countries reported Contagious Bovine Pleuropneumonia
(CBPP) cases in the region in 2003.
The worst CBPP or cattle lung disease cases were reported in Tanzania (URT)
with 20 outbreaks (314 cases and 125 deaths) and Zambia with 17 outbreaks
involving 1 165 cases and 827 deaths. The disease is also a problem in Angola
and Namibia where both morbidity and mortality was reported. The disease
threatens more than 30-50 per cent of the 47 million cattle population of SADC.
Fresh outbreaks of CBPP continued to invade new areas after periods of absence
and the reason has always been uncontrolled cattle movements. The CBPP
situation in southern Tanzania and Zambia is at very high risk level. SADC is
in the process of adopting a regional approach for surveillance and control of
CBPP.
Foot and mouth disease
----------------------
Foot and mouth disease (FMD) was reported in Botswana, Malawi, Mozambique,
South Africa, Tanzania, Zambia, and Mozambique in 2003. The number of reported
FMD foci increased from 40 foci reported in 2002 to 339 foci, an indication
that FMD surveillance system has significantly improved.
According to the 2003 livestock, food and agricultural statistics (FAOSAT), the
SADC region had 51.9 million head of cattle, 41 million sheep, 34.6 million
goats, 5.5 million pigs, 1.6 million equines and about 293 million poultry.
The report says SADC member states have significantly improved their national
animal disease surveillance systems and are using information available from
the surveillance system to define trends of animal diseases occurrence,
determinants and economic impact.
Efforts are under way to establish a regional animal health database as part of
the global livestock information management system to be established in the
course of implementing the Promotional Regional Integration (PRINT) in
Livestock project funded by the European Union (EU).
On other issues, the report states an estimated total of 8 million metric
tonnes of high value food products of animal origin, including beef, mutton,
goat meat, pork, milk, and eggs were produced in the region during the year for
human consumption. These had an estimated value of over US$8 billion on the
assumption that one metric tonne is worth on average US$1000.

[While infectious diseases such as FMD and CBPP will readily spread
via transboundary movements of livestock, this is not the case
regarding anthrax, which is related to soil contamination. - Mod.AS]
[An imported disease, like the current polio imports, refers to sporadic cases
or outbreaks in countries that do not necessarily share common borders. A
transboundary disease is one that spreads from one country to another across a
common border, such as Rinderpest and other epidemic animal diseases
(contagious bovine pleuropneumonia, FMD, contagious caprine pleuropneumonia,
peste de petit ruminants, Rift Valley fever, and lumpy skin disease). FAO has
established EMPRES, Emergency Prevention System for Transboundary Animal &
Plant Pests & Diseases, to combat those, see:
