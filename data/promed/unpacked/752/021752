A man who health officials initially thought died of influenza actually died from [a] hantavirus [infection], the Northeast Colorado Health Department determined on Friday [17 Apr 2015]. This is the 3rd case of hantavirus [pulmonary syndrome; PBS] in Colorado this year [2015], and the 1st time the disease has been identified in a north east Colorado resident. All of this year's cases have been fatal.

The Phillips County man died in January 2015. Another case was reported earlier this month [April 2015] in La Plata County [see ProMED-mail archive no. 20150413.3295294].

Hantavirus [HPS] is a respiratory disease carried by deer mice [_Peromyscus maniculatus_], which are found throughout North America. In Colorado, the virus is mainly transmitted by people breathing in air or dust contaminated with deer mouse urine and feces. It usually happens when they're cleaning out rodent-infested structures near their home.

Symptoms include fever, body aches, headache and vomiting. The illness can progress to respiratory distress within 1-5 days. There is no effective treatment for hantavirus, and health officials say prevention is key.

[Although not stated in the report above, the specific hantavirus involved in this and the previous hantavirus pulmonary syndrome cases probably is Sin Nombre virus, which is endemic in deer mice (_Peromyscus maniculatus_) in Colorado. Although cases of Sin Nombre virus infection are relatively rare, they can be very serious, as the 3 HPS deaths in Colorado this year (2015) indicate. The pubic needs to be aware of the circumstances that lead to risk of virus transmission. This is particularly important at this spring season of the year, when cabins and other outbuildings that have been closed for several months, are reopened and cleaned out, raising dust that may be contaminated with virus from deer mice hosts.
