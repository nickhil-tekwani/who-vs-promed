1 person has died and at least 50 more have fallen ill from salmonellosis which may be linked to watermelons imported from Brazil. The outbreak, which began in December 2011, is believed to involve packs of ready-to-eat sliced watermelon. Health chiefs say the public can protect themselves by washing all types of fruit and vegetables.

Source of outbreak? Watermelon samples tested positive for _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Newport. However, many are unlikely to wash packs of ready-to-eat fruit, which have become enormously popular and are often sold as a healthy lunchtime snack. 70 percent of the victims are female and include a 6-month-old baby and pensioners.

Details of the outbreak, involving the _S._ Newport form of the bug, were revealed by the Health Protection Agency, which is investigating the source alongside the Food Standards Agency.

Confirmed cases: England - 26, Wales - 3, Northern Ireland - 1, Scotland - 5, Republic of Ireland - 5, Germany – 15.

The watermelon sampled was imported from Brazil and between 10 and 15 of the victims reported eating the fruit in the 2 to 3 days before they fell ill. However, the HPA stressed it cannot be certain the victims ate watermelon from Brazil and it is too soon to identify the source.

Brazil is the largest supplier of imported watermelons sold in the UK accounting for around 12 percent of the total, which equates to around 6100 tons. Virtually all the major supermarkets import them from Brazil at this time of year.

Dr Bob Adak, head of gastrointestinal diseases at the HPA, said: "Early indications suggest that a number of people became unwell after eating watermelon. It’s important to remember the risk of becoming unwell after eating watermelon is very low. These cases only represent a very small proportion of total consumption. It is always advisable to wash fruits and vegetables – including watermelon – before consumption to reduce the risk of illness."

Dr Paul Wigley, an expert in food borne diseases based at the University of Liverpool, said: "As _Salmonella_ Newport is often associated with cattle or horses, contamination from animal manure used as fertilizer is a potential source. As this appears to be a problem in pre-sliced melon, contamination on the surface could be transferred to the flesh when cut, or contaminated water may have been used in washing the melons. Fruit and vegetables are not the main source of infection which is usually meat or unpasteurized dairy products, but they can be contaminated with salmonella in production or processing."

Alison Gleadle, director of food safety at the FSA, said: "We are working closely with the European Commission, other countries, local authorities and the food industry, to investigate further."

[This outbreak of salmonellosis, serotype Newport, has been found to have spread to other countries in Europe with what appears to be a microbiologically proven link to watermelons. It is not stated if DNA technology has been used to comfirm that the watermelon and human isolates are genetically linked. More cases are likely to be reported in more countries.- Mod. LL]
