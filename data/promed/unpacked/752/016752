[Up to 21 Jan 2022, 3 FMDV outbreaks in Tunisia (one in Ben Arous and 2 in Monastir governorate) due to the serotype O have been officially reported to the OIE. Clinical signs were observed in cattle and goats.

"The O serotype is divided into 11 topotypes: EAST AFRICA 1 to 4 (EA-1 to -4), SOUTHEAST ASIA (SEA), EUROPE-SOUTH AMERICA (EURO-SA), INDONESIA-1 and -2 (ISA-1 and -2), CATHAY, MIDDLE EAST-SOUTH ASIA (ME-SA) and WEST AFRICA (WA)."
(https://www.wrlfmd.org/fmdv-genome/fmd-prototype-strains)

The information regarding the topotype in the current event isn't available yet. Since 2013, 4 distinct FMD viral lineages have been officially recorded in Maghreb countries: O/ME-SA/Ind-2001 and SAT2/ VII between 2013 and 2015, and A/AFRICA/G-IV and O/EA-3 between 2017 and 2019.

In 2021, Libya notified the OIE of reports of 11 outbreaks of FMD in sheep and goats due to serotype A. These outbreaks occurred between February and November 2020 (https://wahis.oie.int/#/report-info?reportId=37168). Also, 3 bovine outbreaks due to serotype O (recorded in June 2021) have been notified to the OIE (https://wahis.oie.int/#/report-info?reportId=41113). Information on the 2 topotypes recorded in Libya in 2020 and 2021 is not available.
