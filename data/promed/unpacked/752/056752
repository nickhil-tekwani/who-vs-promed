Late blight: the threat to the potato continues in Algeria
----------------------------------------------------------
Fungal diseases of crop plants remain a topical issue in Algeria. Late
blight, which in 2006 destroyed 75 per cent of the harvest of table
potatoes in the provinces of Mostaganem, Chlef, and Ain Defla, continues to
be an issue, even if in the last 2 years its toll on the potatoes was lower.

The early planting of potatoes in Mostaganem is thought to have avoided
disaster. "This region has a special microclimate for the cultivation of
early potatoes," says the director of the regional station of the National
Institute of Plant Protection (INPV). The weather of recent weeks has been
conducive to the spread of the fungus. "The epidemic can spread very
quickly in the field," he says.

A threat to potato yield must be taken seriously. INPV warned farmers
against this threat while providing them with a treatment schedule and the
list of fungicides needed. So why does this disease continue to be an issue
in Algeria?

[The reason may be that] throughout the region, farmers remain skeptical.
There are few who use preventative treatments on their plots, and this
explains the prevalence of the disease. And yet, according to experts,
fungicide treatments are enough to prevent the spread of this disease. The
director of the regional INPV believes that if the advice had been strictly
followed by farmers, the disease would never have taken hold in Algeria. In
addition, the price for agricultural fungicides is being blamed which has
been increasing in recent years.

[Potato late blight (PLB) is caused by the fungus-like organism
_Phytophthora infestans_. It can cause 100 per cent crop losses in potato
and tomato, but considerable variation in aggressiveness between different
strains has been observed. The pathogen is spread by plant material, wind,
and water. Untreated potato seed tubers pose a high risk for crop
infection, and this may be a source of spread in Algeria as well. PLB
disease management generally relies on fungicide treatments of seed tubers
and crops, but new and more virulent strains are emerging frequently. For
more information on PLB see links and previous ProMED-mail posts below.
