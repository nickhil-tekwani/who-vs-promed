Russian medics who treated radiation victims after a military explosion in the Arctic had no protection, and now fear they were irradiated themselves. Two of the medics in Arkhangelsk spoke to BBC Russian about the victims' evacuation, on condition of anonymity.

A total of 5 nuclear engineers died on [8 Aug 2019] when an "isotope-fuel" engine blew up at the Nyonoksa test range, officials said. Two military personnel also died. President Vladimir Putin said the test involved a new weapon system. In addition, 6 people were injured in the accident, but officials gave few details about it.

On [14 Aug 2019], Russia's weather service Rosgidromet revealed radiation levels had spiked 16 times above normal in Severodvinsk, a city 47 km (29 mi) east of Nyonoksa. [To summarise, 13 people suffered injury or death from this explosion on 8 Aug 2019 and the radiation was 16 times above normal 6 days later. This is concerning and underscores the hospital's concern for its facilities and workers. - Mod.TG]

According to the official data, the radiation reaching Severodvinsk was not heavy enough to cause radiation sickness. [Sounds odd if it was 16 times normal levels. - Mod.TG]

Experts in Russia and the West say the test was most likely linked to the new 9M730 Burevestnik nuclear-powered cruise missile, called "Skyfall" by NATO. Last year [2018], Mr Putin said the technology would give the missile "unlimited" range.

The Arkhangelsk medics, who spoke to the BBC's Pavel Aksenov, said at least 90 people came into contact with the casualties, but the military did not warn them of any nuclear contamination risk. [It is hoped radiation decontamination was undertaken as soon as they became aware. - Mod.TG]

The medics were at the civilian Arkhangelsk regional hospital, which treated 3 of the injured, while 3 other casualties were taken to an Arkhangelsk hospital called Semashko, which is equipped for radiation emergencies. [The medics are right to be concerned. Without knowing the isotope involved, they could have been exposed, and it could represent contamination of the rooms where they or their patients were. - Mod.TG]

The medics said they were speaking out now because they feared for their own health and did not want any similar "[safety] violations" to recur. "We don't want them to bring [nuclear accident victims to] us next time, not 3, but 10 people, God forbid, and hide the information from us again," said one. The degree of secrecy surrounding the explosion has drawn comparisons with the 1986 Chernobyl disaster, when Soviet officials were slow to admit the truth.

The Arkhangelsk medics said it was clear the 3 [patients] brought to their regional hospital were very sick. Doctors examined them in the emergency room, then sent them to an operating theatre. But the emergency room continued to admit other patients for about an hour, the medics said, until the doctors realised the 3 "had received a very high radiation dose". The hospital handles pregnancy complications and other difficult medical conditions.

"The radiation picture was developing by the hour. Blood tests were being done, and every hour you could see this or that cell count was plunging. That signified a very high radiation dose," they said. [This sounds quite serious for these patients. - Mod.TG] The hospital staff kept treating the victims despite knowing about the radiation dose. The staff had to improvise some self-protection -- for example, they took face masks from the helicopter crews' emergency kit. The next day [9 Aug 2019] the 3 victims were transferred to a hospital in Moscow, which has radiation specialists. Their condition now is unknown.

A military team later carried out decontamination work in the Arkhangelsk hospital. The medics said the casualties' clothing was removed, along with stretchers and a "highly radioactive bath". [It would be useful to know when this occurred in relationship to when the patients were there, or if any of the hospital staffs' scrubs, coats or clothing were taken or if the treatment rooms were decontaminated. - Mod.TG]

"Our cleaners should have been advised; they're just simple country folk; they were just picking up sacks and bundles and carrying them out," said one. The other medic said hospital staff were now mentally stressed, knowing radiation safety information had been withheld from them during the emergency. Two weeks after the explosion the Russian health ministry said none of the medics at the Arkhangelsk hospitals had received a hazardous radiation dose. Its conclusion was based on medical examination of 91 staff.

On Monday [19 Aug 2019] an international nuclear agency reported [that] the 2 Russian radiation monitoring stations nearest to Nyonoksa had gone offline soon after the explosion. The revelation fueled suspicions [that] the radiation could have been heavier than officially reported. [If the radiation monitoring stations were offline, do we know how much radiation the patients may have received, and how much the hospital staff may have received? - Mod.TG]

The Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO) said the technical failure at those sites was then followed by a failure at 2 more. It tweeted an animation showing the potential radiation plume from the explosion. Russia said the weapons test was none of the CTBTO's business, and added handing over radiation data was voluntary. Two of the monitoring stations have since started working again.

[This is concerning for the health of the workers, and for the doctors, nurses, and all the hospital staff and the hospital facilities. We hope the workers and facilities will be properly examined and decontaminated. We also hope the victims and those treating the victims recover without lasting consequences. - Mod.TG
