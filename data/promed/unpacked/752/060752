Viet Nam: avian influenza situation - WHO update 3
--------------------------------------------------
As of 14 Jan 2005, WHO has received informal reports of 2 additional cases
of avian influenza A (H5N1) virus infection in Viet Nam. The cases are an
18 year old woman from Hau Giang Province and a 35 year old woman from Tra
Vinh Province. The 18 year old woman was admitted to hospital on 1 Jan 2005
and died on 10 Jan 2005. The 35 year old woman was admitted to hospital on
9 Jan 2005 and remains in a critical condition.
Both patients are from provinces in the southern part of the country, where
poultry outbreaks have been reported since the beginning of December
[2004]. If confirmed, these latest human cases will bring the total in Viet
Nam, since mid-December 2004, to 6. Of these, 4 have died.
[This update from WHO confirms the information posted in ProMED-mail post
archived as "Avian influenza, human - East Asia (07): Viet Nam
20050113.0118". The cumulative number of fatal cases in Viet Nam will rise
to 24 if the 35 year old woman identified above does not recover. - Mod.CP]

Viet Nam: death of 35 year old patient reported: 9 year old believed to
have contracted disease through swimming in contaminated water
-------------------------------------------------
A 35 year old woman has become Vietnam's 5th fatality in 2 weeks from the
avian influenza virus which is spreading again through the country's
poultry farms, mainly in the south. The woman, who was transferred from Tra
Vinh province and tested positive for the H5N1 [serotype] poultry virus,
died on 12 Jan 2005 in a Ho Chi Minh City hospital, the state-run Labour
newspaper stated on Fri 14 Jan 2005. She had suffered from high fever and
respiratory difficulties 2 weeks ago after eating a chicken infected in
renewed outbreaks, which struck in early Dec 2004 and [revived] fears the
virus could mutate into one which could cause a pandemic.
Vietnamese officials said they suspected another death would soon be blamed
on the virus. One of Viet Nam's laboratories designated for avian influenza
virus tests was also looking into whether bird flu was the cause of death
of another patient, who died on Thu 13 Jan 2005 in Mekong Delta province.
The World Health Organization said the H5N1 virus was "a particularly
frightening virus" as more than 70 per cent (25 people) of human cases
identified in Viet Nam had died. "If strong measures are not in place, the
influenza H5N1 epidemic can [could] spread to an unmeasurable extent," Hans
Troedsson, Vietnamese representative of the UN health agency, was quoted by
state media as saying at a health conference on Thu 13 Jan 2005. "If this
virus is [becomes] capable of jumping from human to human, the risk is that
2 to 7 million people could die," the Labour newspaper quoted him as saying.
There has been one firm case [of person-to-person transmission] in
Thailand, where 12 people have died of bird flu; experts are fairly sure
the virus was passed from person to person.
So far most avian influenza victims have eaten or lived with sick chickens.
But the Labour newspaper quoted officials as saying a 9 year old boy who
died from avian influenza on 4 Jan 2005 caught the disease by swimming in
water used for the disposal of infected poultry.
The Agriculture Ministry's animal health department said on Fri 14 Jan 2005
that the avian influenza had recurred just outside Hanoi, killing 600
chickens and ducks at 2 farms in Long Bien district on Thu 13 Jan 2005.
Health workers slaughtered the remaining 400 chickens and ducks and
disinfected the farms, it said. Hanoi, home to around 3 million people, has
now become the 2nd place in Viet Nam's north to face a recurrence of avian
influenza. The Ministry said 10 new outbreaks were detected on Thu 13 Jan
2005 in 4 Mekong Delta provinces and Hanoi, resulting in the slaughter and
death of more than 22 000 chickens, ducks and [other] birds.
The disease has devastated the poultry industry in a number of countries as
millions of birds were slaughtered to halt the virus. Malaysia, however,
has declared itself free of the disease and Thailand has had no new cases
since November 2004.
WHO said on its website that the 26 Dec 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami may have
raised the risk of an influenza pandemic, even though the giant wave did
not hit the areas where the poultry virus has been rampant. "Any activity
that spreads avian influenza increases the possibility of the emergence of
a pandemic virus," the statement said, calling for tight controls on
poultry movement into the areas hit by the tsunami and on food relief
activities. By Thu 13 Jan 2005, nearly 180 000 poultry had been slaughtered
or died from avian influenza in Viet Nam since it recurred. During 2004,
the epidemic wiped out 17 per cent of Viet Nam's poultry stock of 250
million <http://www.who.int>.
