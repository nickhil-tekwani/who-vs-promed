[2] Monitoring on farms: comment
Date: 7 Mar 2014
From: Nick Honhold <nick.honhold@gmail.com> [edited]

Re: Avian influenza (36): China, LPAI H7N9, poultry, monitoring, RFI
-----------------------------------------------------
I looked at the Veterinary Bureau report on-line using the link in the [above] Promed post. The translation [from Chinese] (by Google) shows at least the provinces sampled and also that all 64 sero-positive samples were from Hunan. The 2 virus positive samples were also from Hunan.

Of the 32 Provinces listed in the report, serum samples were tested from 9 and pathogen testing was done in 10, with 7 provinces having both types of sampling and 20 had neither.

No information on the numbers of samples from different production systems overall or by province.

[3] H7N9 Vaccine

H7N9 vaccine may hit market in May
------------------------------------
Vaccines for H7N9 bird flu could hit the market as early as May, a Chinese expert on infectious disease said Friday [7 Mar 2014]

The vaccine is currently being submitted to drug control authorities for tests, said Li Lanjuan, an academician with the Chinese Academy of Engineering.

"If everything goes smoothly, we could have the vaccine on the market within 1 to 2 months," said Li, who is also a member of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference National Committee.

According to official statistics, H7N9 has infected more than 120 people in China and killed at least 36 of them so far this year. [Figures in need of updating. According to the case tallies available at the Hong Kong CHP website, as of 6 Mar 2014 there have been a total of 375 laboratory-confirmed human infections with influenza A(H7N9) virus. For additional details and for information on the most recent human case, see 20140308.2320911. -Mod. AS].

Li said there has not been any substantial evidence for consistent human-to-human infection of H7N9, adding that poultry markets remained the primary source of infection [see comment].

Closing markets and culling poultry are still the most effective ways to contain the virus, she said.

[Since the start of the LPAI H7N9 event, reportedly in Apr 2013, 35 "outbreaks" in animals have been reported by China to the OIE; their summary, with an interactive map, is available at
http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=13225. All "outbreaks" save one were identified by testing samples collected from several poultry species in live markets. One case was reportedly farm-based: a single pigeon at a pigeon farm in Haian County of Jiangsu Province, reported by ProMED-mail in the posting 20130422.1664423 and in the commentary to posting 20130426.1674487. This case was reported by China to the OIE in follow-up report No 4, dated 22 Apr 2013, available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?reportid=13289.

In posting 20140306.2318268, we briefly cited a report by China's Ministry of Agriculture about serological findings in 39 backyard farms and 2 commercial farms; further information was requested. Some additional information, derived from the same source, is kindly provided in Dr Honhold's submission (item 2 above). Our request for clarification of this important issue is repeated.

It will be helpful to note if the developed H7N9 vaccine is a human vaccine; in case affirmed, which population segments are considered for vaccination?

According to the report in item 3, "poultry markets remained the primary source of [human] infection". To limit the circulation of the LPAI H7N9 virus, the origin of avian infection has to be identified. This will require enhanced H7N9 surveillance on poultry farms (chickens, ducks, geese, and pigeons). Such surveillance has reportedly been already required, on China's Mainland, from farms authorised to supply live poultry to the territory of Hong Kong. - Mod.AS]
