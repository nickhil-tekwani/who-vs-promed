12 dead in cholera outbreak in Al-Roseires area: doctors' union
---------------------------------------------------------------
An outbreak of cholera has killed at least 12 people in Al-Roseires area in Sudan's Blue Nile State, a senior health official said on Wednesday, 14 Sep 2016. Ahmed Al Sheikh, Sudanese doctors' union, told Radio Tamazuj that they received confirmed reports in September 2016 that about 12 people died of cholera in Al-Roseires area near the border with South Sudan and Ethiopia.

Al Sheikh called for the closure of Roseires borders with its neighboring areas so medical staff could contain the outbreak in the area. The doctors' leader urged the National Ministry of Health to declare a cholera outbreak in Al-Roseires locality and ask the World Health Organization to intervene as soon as possible.

[2] Cholera - Eritrea (Upper Gash-Barka Region)

Activists have reported a serious cholera outbreak in the Upper Gash-Barka Region of Eritrea, which is proving difficult to control. The outbreak was 1st observed at Barentu Referral Hospital 2 weeks ago when people who had travelled from the upper Gash region were reported to be suffering from an illness that was not diagnosed easily. However, as a result of the extended time taken for accurate diagnosis of cholera due to a severe shortage of expertise and infrastructure, the outbreak spread widely, affecting areas of the Gash-Barka Region.

It has now been a week since the Ministry of Health acknowledged the outbreak as being a potential national epidemic and has briefed health professionals in the region to that effect.

So far, the effort to curb the spread is proving futile, and the impact of the outbreak is being felt across the region. Markets were deserted as a result of the spread, and even cattle markets in small villages outside Barentu have been cordoned off to prevent the spread. An expert at the Ministry of Health's public health section for preventing such epidemics stated: "There is currently no national emergency response team to prevent and control such outbreaks; we are, therefore, prone to such epidemics, as it always takes time to pull such a team together to both control the outbreak and treat victims."

Already, the current epidemic is said to have spread from the Upper Gash Region to the Southern Region and particularly to the area of Mai Dima, where an epidemic control team has been dispatched.

According to health experts in the region, when such an outbreak occurs, even able-bodied adults find it impossible to cope with the acute loss of bodily fluids. Without appropriate medical assistance, it is impossible for patients to recover, and the situation is considerably worse for pregnant women and children.

Given the lack of public health awareness, Arbi Harnet calls on the people to take preventive actions by strictly adhering to personal and public hygiene practices.
