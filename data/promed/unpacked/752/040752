1st report of gray mold in tomato caused by _Botrytis cinerea_ in Baja
California, Mexico
---------------------------------
RJ Holguin-Pena, FG Arcos, Centro de Investigaciones Biologicas del
Noroeste, Mar Bermejo No. 195, Col. Playa Palo de Santa Rita. AP 128, La
Paz, BCS 23090, Mexico. Plant Dis 2005; 89: 528, published online as DOI:
10.1094/PD-89-0528B. Accepted for publication 1 Feb 2005.
San Quintin Valley, a 60 mile long coastal plain (30 deg 30 min N, 116
degW) in the Baja California Peninsula, is one of the major fresh tomato
(_Lycopersicon esculentum_ Mill.) production areas in Mexico with more than
8000 ha.
In the past 10 years, the valley's tomato production has declined because
of gray mold and stem canker diseases. Flower rot, reddish brown margins on
the leaves and stems, and fruit with a gray mold were observed on
field-grown tomato plants (Roma type cv. Tequila) in the autumn of 2003.
Severity ranging from 55 to 60 per cent was observed at harvest.
Infected tissues were sampled and disinfested by immersion in 1 per cent
NaOCl for 1 min, rinsed in sterile water, and placed on malt extract agar
at 22 deg C. Fungal conidia were then transferred to 2 per cent potato
dextrose agar (PDA). The resulting fungal colonies were definitively
identified as _Botrytis cinerea_ Pers.:Fr.
The colonies of _B. cinerea_ were first hyaline and white and became dark
gray after 96 h. Mycelia were septate with dark branched conidiophores.
Conidia were unicellular, ellipsoid, and ranged from 5 to 8 -- 8 to 14
micrometers. Profuse black sclerotia developed in 7 day old cultures.
Infection site analyses in diseased flowers at different stages during the
bloom were done with scanning electron microscopy. Fungal hyphae were
located predominantly on the receptacle areas, whereas conidia were located
in the ovaries as described previously (1).
The identity of _B. cinerea_ was confirmed by a restriction digest with
ApoI of the 413-kb polymerase chain reaction amplification product obtained
with BA2f/BA1r primers (2) and random amplified polymorphic DNA banding
patterns (3).
Pathogenicity tests were done by spray inoculation of 1 ml aqueous conidial
suspension (1 million CFU/ml) on 20 healthy plants during the blossom
stage. An equal number of plants sprayed with sterile water was used as the
control. Plants were incubated at 20 ï¿½ 2 deg C for 5 days.
The fungus was reisolated from diseased flowers and peduncles after surface
disinfestation (2.5 per cent NaOCl) and plating on PDA. No symptoms were
observed in the noninoculated controls.
To our knowledge, this is the 1st report of _B. cinerea_ causing gray mold
disease on tomato in Baja California.

[I was surprised to note that Botrytis blight or gray mold [GM] has not
been reported prior to this post, given its wide host range. GM is a fungus
disease infecting many herbaceous annual and perennial crops. GM can be
particularly damaging under continuous rainy, drizzly weather conditions
for several days. The host range of GM is extensive (asparagus, bean, beet,
crucifers, cucurbits, eggplant, grape, lettuce, onion, pepper, potato,
tomato, turnip, and others). If cool, overcast conditions predominate, the
disease progresses and a fuzzy grey mold develops. If conditions are warm
and sunny, only ghost spots remain without any further disease progression.
Cool, wet weather exacerbates disease expression. Fungicides can be used to
prevent the spread of infection.
