Park leaders announced on Monday [27 Aug 2012] that 2 more suspected cases of the [a] rare hantavirus [infection], one of them a fatality, have been found among people who visited Yosemite National Park in mid-June. All told, 4 people are now believed to have contracted the virus while staying at the park this summer; 2 died, including a 37-year-old Alameda County man. The 4 stayed in separate tent cabins in Curry Village located within 100 feet [30.5 m] of each other, park ranger Scott Gediman said Monday [27 Aug 2012].

People typically get the rare disease from exposure to the droppings, urine, or saliva of wild mice [virus infected deer mice, _Peromyscus maniculatus_].

The park concessionaire is attempting to contact visitors who stayed in a Signature Tent Cabin from mid-June [2012] through the end of August to advise them to seek immediate medical attention if they exhibit any signs of hantavirus [infection]. The disease often begins with a fever, headache, and muscle aches, but can progress rapidly to a life-threatening illness. Symptoms may develop as late as 6 weeks after exposure.

The fatality announced Monday [27 Aug 2012] involved an adult male from out of state, Gediman said. One of the 2 people recovering was an Inland Empire woman in her 40s. Gediman said he had no details about the 2nd person.

"The health of our visitors is our paramount concern, and we are making every effort to notify and inform our visitors of any potential illness," said Don Neubacher, the park superintendent, in a prepared statement.

The park district, working with the national Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is asking state and local health departments nationwide to be on the lookout for other suspected cases.

Every park visitor is now being handed information about the hantavirus and notifications are posted throughout the park, Gediman said.

For the most part, the tent cabins remain open. "We've done a thorough cleansing of them," he said. Park officials have been retrofitting the tent cabins to block areas where mice might enter, Gediman said. The park is also increasing its rodent trapping.

In previous years, 2 people became sick with [a] hantavirus after visiting Yosemite -- one in 2010 and another in 2000. They had stayed in Tuolumne Meadows, and both survived.

Since the [Sin Nombre] hantavirus was first identified in 1993, about 587 cases have been found nationally, including 60 in California. About one third of the cases are fatal.

[This report does not indicate which hantavirus is involved in these cases. The hantavirus in this report from California is doubtless Sin Nombre virus, which is endemic there and in most of the western USA and south western Canada. Its rodent host is the deer mouse, _Peromyscus maniculatus_. It is unusual to have 4 cases occur in a single, very limited focal area, Curry Village, within the space of 2 months. This suggests that the deer mouse population is abundant in Curry Village, and perhaps supporting active virus transmission and shedding there at this time.
