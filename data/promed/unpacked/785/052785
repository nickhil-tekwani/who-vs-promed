Abstract
--------
We conducted enhanced acute febrile illness surveillance in an urban slum community in Salvador, Brazil. We found that rickettsial infection accounted for 3.5% of urgent care visits for acute fever. Our results suggest that rickettsiae might be an underrecognized, treatable cause of acute febrile illness in impoverished urban populations in Brazil.

_Rickettsia_ spp are small, obligately intracellular, Gram-negative bacilli. The genus includes the spotted fever group rickettsiae (SFGR) and typhus group rickettsiae (TGR). SFGR and TGR are underrecognized causes of acute febrile illness (AFI) worldwide, particularly in the tropics, because clinical manifestations of rickettsial infections are often indistinguishable from those of other endemic infections (1). Recent studies have suggested that SFGR profiles in Brazil might be shifting toward an increasing number of cases in urban areas (2). However, knowledge of whether rickettsiae cause AFI in urban settings is limited, especially in informal settlements where social determinants and the presence of potential vectors and reservoirs might favor transmission. Rickettsiae-mediated AFI has considerable public health and therapeutic implications because prompt administration of targeted antimicrobial therapy can reduce illness and death associated with rickettsioses (3).

To evaluate whether rickettsial infections might be a potential cause of AFI in an urban slum setting, we performed enhanced surveillance from 1 Apr 2009, through 31 Oct 2012, in a public sector urgent care facility that served a community of about 55 000 inhabitants in Salvador, Brazil (4). We identified and enrolled eligible outpatients who were >5 years of age and had a measured (>37.8 deg C [100.4 deg F]) or reported fever of <21 days duration. We collected blood samples during the acute phase at the time of enrollment and during the convalescent phase >15 days later. We screened serum samples at an initial dilution of 1:64 using a rickettsial immunofluorescence assay in which the _Rickettsia rickettsii_ [the tick-borne causative agent of Rocky Mountain spotted fever] Sheila Smith strain was used to determine SFGR IgG reactivity, and _R. typhi_ [flea-borne the causative agent of murine typhus] Wilmington strain was used to determine TGR IgG reactivity. Laboratory-confirmed rickettsial infections were defined as seroconversion (negative acute-phase titer and convalescent-phase titer of >128) or a 4-fold increase in titer between acute- and convalescent-phase samples. We detected dengue viral infections using DENV reverse transcription PCR, Panbio Dengue Early ELISA (NS1 antigen-capture), and Bioline Dengue IgM-capture ELISA (Abbott Laboratories, https://www.abbott.com) (5,6) and leptospirosis using the microscopic agglutination test (7). The study was approved by the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation Committee on Ethics in Research, Brazilian National Council for Ethics in Research, and Yale University Institutional Review Board.

Among 5035 enrolled patients with AFI, 1016 (20.2%, 95% CI 19.1%-21.3%) had confirmed dengue and 137 (2.7%, 95% CI 2.3%-3.2%) had confirmed leptospirosis. Among the 3882 patients who did not have dengue or leptospirosis, 1016 (26.2%) did not fulfill criteria for an influenza-like illness (temperature >37.8°C, reported fever and cough, or sore throat for <7 days), and these patients provided acute- and convalescent-phase serum samples. We used a random number generator to select 200 patients from the 1016 participants whose samples were evaluated in the rickettsial immunofluorescence assay. Of those 200 patients, we identified 6 (3.0%, 95% CI 1.4%-6.4%) patients who had SFGR-positive serum samples and 1 (0.5%, 95% CI 0.0%-2.8%) patient who had a TGR-positive serum sample (Table).

Patients who had SFGR- and TGR-positive samples were 6-42 years of age, and 5 of the 7 patients were women. All 7 patients had measured (>37.8 deg C) or reported fever, 6 of 7 patients reported headaches, and 5 of 7 patients reported myalgia. Patients did not report a rash (Table). The 7 patients attended the urgent care facility 1-10 days after the onset of symptoms and had mild self-limiting illnesses. Those patients did not receive antimicrobial therapy or require hospitalization; symptoms resolved within 30 days of onset.

Identifying rickettsial infections among patients attending an urgent care facility in an urban center in Brazil is noteworthy because rickettsiae have not previously been described as a substantial cause of AFI in urban populations in this country. Of note, the immunofluorescence assay used is unable to differentiate among _Rickettsia_ spp. _R. rickettsii_ is a well-described cause of spotted fever in Brazil in rural settings and _R. parkeri_ is an emerging cause of infection (8-10). Antibodies that are cross-reactive with _R. rickettsii_ can be stimulated by _R. parkeri_, _R. akari_, and other SFGR. _R. typhi_ has been rarely reported as a cause of AFI in urban settings. Other rickettsial species identified in Brazil are _R. felis_, _R. rhipicephali_, _R. bellii_, _R. amblyommatis_, _R. andeanae_, and _R. monteiroi_, although their pathogenicity is unclear (10).

Although all causative rickettsial species, potential vectors, and reservoirs have yet to be identified, this study suggests that rickettsiae might be a cause of AFI in urban slum settings in Brazil. A limitation of this study is that it was performed in a single urban center; further studies will be needed to confirm the generalizability of these findings. However, these findings raise clinical awareness for rickettsiae as a potential cause of AFI in urban slum populations in the tropics and the possible need for empiric antimicrobial therapy in suspected cases, especially because diagnostic testing is often lacking in these urban environments.

[Brazilian spotted fever (BSF), which is also known in Portuguese as febre maculosa Brasileira, is caused by the same bacterium, _Rickettsia rickettsii_, that causes Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF), which BSF resembles clinically. The hard bodied tick, _Amblyomma_ spp, is the main vector for BSF and in most of the BSF-endemic areas, capybaras (_Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris_) are the principal host for _Amblyomma_ ticks. Capybaras are also efficient amplifier hosts of _R. rickettsii_ (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3892071/). Capybaras are large rodents, weighing 77-150 lbs (35-68 kg). They are native to South America and are semiaquatic, living near bodies of water, such as lakes, swamps, ponds, marshes, and along rivers in the tropical rainforest.

The initial presenting clinical picture of BSF is generally nonspecific, with fever, muscle pains, and headache. The rash begins on day 3 of illness, initially maculopapular. The characteristic red to purple spotted (petechial) rash of BSF is usually not seen until the 6th day or later after onset of symptoms. Although the incidence of BSF is low, if not treated promptly, BSF can likely be lethal, with a case-fatality ranging from 30% to over 50%. Doxycycline is used for the treatment of BSF in adults and children of all ages and is most effective if started before the 5th day of symptoms. Therefore, empiric treatment for this infection should always be started in people with compatible symptoms inhabiting or visiting endemic areas, even if there is no history of a tick bite.

BSF has usually been reported from 4 Brazilian states, located in the southeastern region of Brazil: São Paulo, Minas Gerais, Rio de Janeiro, and Espírito Santo (https://www.scielo.br/j/rsbmt/a/wxxkNCr6cvmvKhzbBvPBk7w/). However, the study above reports serologic evidence of rickettsial infection in patients with mild self-limiting illnesses attending an urgent care clinic in an urban slum in the capital city (Salvador) of the Brazilian state of Bahia. These patients did not have a rash and did not receive antimicrobial therapy or require hospitalization; nevertheless, their symptoms resolved within 30 days of onset. BSF seems an unlikely cause of the illness in these patients and the use of empiric doxycycline for patients with this type of illness would seem to be unnecessary.

Bahia is one of the 26 states of Brazil, located in the Northeast Region of the country. It is the 4th largest Brazilian state by population (after São Paulo, Minas Gerais, and Rio de Janeiro) and the 5th-largest by area. Salvador, its capital city (pop., almost 2.9 million residents in 2020), has a tropical rainforest or equatorial climate, with temperatures varying little throughout the year; About 50% of the population have African ancestry, 36.3% European, and 14.5% Native American (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador,_Bahia).
