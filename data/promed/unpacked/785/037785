First West Nile Virus-positive Dead Bird in Chatham County
----------------------------------------------------------
West Nile virus was confirmed on Wed 12 Sep 2001 in a blue jay found on
Isle of Hope. The dead bird was the first positive case of the virus in
Chatham County. But with 36 other Georgia counties reporting 162 birds, 5
horses, and one human with West Nile virus infection, Chatham's case seemed
inevitable.
Georgia's first indication of West Nile virus was an infected crow found in
Lowndes County in July. In August, a 71-year-old Atlanta woman died from
the virus. An Isle of Hope resident reported the blue jay to the Health
Department on 1 Sep 2001. Testing by the Southeastern Cooperative Wildlife
Disease Study at the University of Georgia in Athens confirmed that it was
infected with the virus.
Monitoring and testing of dead birds will continue to try to determine the
extent of the virus in Chatham."It's hard to assess the meaning of the risk
of finding one bird," said Henry Lewandowski, director of the Chatham
County Mosquito Control Commission.
Mosquito Control's aerial spraying program for mosquitoes was suspended
indefinitely after the Federal Aviation Administration grounded planes in
the wake of Tuesday's hijackings. Mosquito trucks have been spraying,
though, with concentrated efforts on the Isle of Hope and the Hutchinson
Island/River Street area, where mosquito populations have been high.
Mosquito Control will also conduct additional monitoring on Isle of Hope.
Between 3 and 6 mosquito traps baited with decaying hay will be set to
attract female mosquitoes that have already had a blood meal and are ready
to lay eggs. The females look for water rich in organic material so [that
their newly hatched filter-feeding larvae will have something to eat. The
trapped mosquitoes will be sent to Athens, [Georgia for West Nile [virus
testing.
