Wednesday, Belgium's chicken pollution scandal spread, with countries
across Europe banning the import and sale of the tainted birds, eggs and
by-products and the European Union (EU) ordering their destruction. The
scandal has forced two Belgian Cabinet ministers to resign and left the
government open to charges it waited nearly a month to tell the public the
chickens and eggs were laced with high levels of the carcinogen dioxin.
"This is completely unacceptable. We reserve the right to take the
necessary steps," EU Farm Commissioner Franz Fischler said, accusing
Belgium of previously withholding information on the dioxin.
In Belgium, two officials from a major animal feed fat producer were
arrested and accused of tampering with the fat that goes into chicken feed.
The chickens became tainted when they ate the toxic feed, according to
media reports.
The EU's executive commission on Wednesday ordered its member nations to
destroy any poultry, eggs, or by-products produced from Jan. 15 to June 1
by some 400 suspect farms.
Authorities in Greece incinerated tons of Belgian poultry and egg products
at an Athens landfill and Russian health authorities banned imports and
sales of Belgian chickens. The Netherlands, Germany and France already had
taken measures against the chickens.
The EU Commission will now investigate the issue further to see if the
dioxin contamination was accidental "or far more serious," said EU Consumer
Affairs Commissioner Emma Bonino.
"Acute (health) effects appear to be relatively unlikely," said Bonino. But
"there are possible long-term effects."
Belgium exported about $340 million in chickens and eggs last year.

Russia has banned chicken meat imports from Belgium because of their
suspected contamination with dioxin, a highly toxic agent, Russian chief
veterinary physician Vyacheslav Avilov told Itar-Tass on Wednesday.
According to Avilov, "those measures had to be taken, after cases of the
contamination of chicken meat with dioxin were registered in Belgium."
Veterinary centers in Russian regions were ordered "to arrest and
confiscate at the border check points, storage facilities, meat-packing
factories and food stores the chicken meat that came from Belgium." At the
same time, the instruction was issued to find out how much Belgian chicken
meat is kept in refrigerators, at food stores and at public catering
enterprises, in order to block its way to consumers.
Avilov said dioxin had been brought to Belgian poultry farms as part of
combined fodder, which included fat used already for frying potatoes.
Repeated use of such fat is strictly forbidden, because dioxin is formed in
it.
Dioxin is produced as well during the burning of polyethylene film,
bottles, and boxes.

On Wednesday various European governments attempted to reassure worried
consumers as it became clear Belgium's poisoned chicken and egg scandal had
spread beyond its own borders and spilled into derived products.
France began removing from shops eggs and chickens produced at French farms
thought to have used Belgian feed contaminated with the cancer-causing
chemical dioxin, after the European Union (EU) used emergency powers to
order the destruction of suspect foods across Europe.
French Agriculture Minister Jean Glavany said Europe was "facing a grave
crisis with respect to food security," while Russia threatened to extend an
existing ban on Belgian poultry meat imports to France, Germany and the
Netherlands.
Those 3 countries are believed to be most at risk from importing tainted
Belgian animal feed or products, and France has already quarantined at
least 70 poultry farms.
Earlier, the EU's top veterinary committee backed European Commission plans
to trace and destroy all egg and chicken-based foods which could be sourced
to feed contaminated with fats supplied by the Verkest firm, based near
Ghent. Two of the company's managers, Lucien Verkest and his son Jan, were
arrested and charged with fraud Wednesday.
The EU decision affects goods with an egg content over two percent -- which
includes fresh pasta, mayonnaise and cakes -- and products manufactured
between January 15 and June 1.
"The main objective is to avoid any harm to the consumer and to ensure
contaminated products are not sold or exported and don't come into
circulation in any other way," acting EU Farm Commissioner Franz Fischler
said.
Belgian chocolate makers moved swiftly to refute claims their prestigious
products could also be affected, declaring chocolate completely safe for
human consumption.
Europe's latest food scare comes as consumer confidence in meat remains
shaky following Britain's mad cow disease scandal and controversy in
Belgium over residues of tranquilizers found in pork and hormones in beef.
European Consumer Affairs Commissioner Emma Bonino said the doses of dioxin
recently found in Belgian chicken "gave rise to concern" although acute
near-term effects were unlikely.
"But there are possible long-term effects. Dioxin is a category one
carcinogen," she said. And she questioned whether this was an isolated
incident. "Are we talking about a one-off or the habitual use of a toxic
element in animal feed?"
The contaminated fats were passed onto around a dozen feed manufacturers,
including plants in the Netherlands and France. They in turn, supplied
farms in their countries as well as Germany. Some 400 farms in Belgium are
believed to be affected.
Fischler warned Belgium it could face legal action for failing to alert its
EU partners to the potential danger sooner.
He said Belgian farmers first noticed health problems with poultry in
January, but it was not until April 26 that the authorities had proof of
the presence of high dioxin levels.
France and the Netherlands were informed of the problem in early May, but
the Commission was not told until May 27.
Belgian Farm Minister Karel Pinxten and Health Minister Marcel Colla
resigned Tuesday over the scandal. A sales ban came into force in Belgium
last Friday.
Belgium's largest food retailer GB said the scare had already cost it 200
million Belgian francs ($5.14 million) and that the figure could rise
substantially following the EU's instruction to destroy all suspect food.
