Tropical mosquitoes that bite relentlessly and are capable of spreading painful diseases are now infesting more Orange County neighborhoods, and if they survive the winter, they could be here to stay.

These 2 tropical species -- known commonly as Asian tiger [_Aedes albopictus_] and yellow fever [_Aedes aegypti_] -- have been found in 9 sites over 8 communities, including 2 locations in Anaheim, among which, Katella Avenue and Haster Street, is a half-mile [1 km] from Disneyland Resort.

The Disneyland site is particularly concerning, said Orange County Vector Control spokesman Jared Dever, because these mosquitoes spread diseases after biting a person who is sick -- typically a traveler from a region where the diseases are prevalent, including Mexico and the Caribbean.

Disneyland operates its own vector control program, but a spokeswoman declined to provide specifics. "We have a very effective mosquito prevention and monitoring program in place and we work closely with Orange County Vector Control," said spokeswoman Suzi Brown.

"We don't do any work on Disneyland resort property," said Dever.

Dever said officials are finding the mosquitoes -- which can spread dengue and chikungunya viruses -- at about 40 percent of the properties they inspect. He called the county's level of infestation "disappointing."

A warm, rainy winter ushered in by El Nino could favor the tropical mosquitoes, which might not survive freezing temperatures. They won't likely be wiped out by torrents of rain, either. These species lay their eggs in containers, and the larvae dive to the bottom to avoid being flushed away.

"In the spring, the emergence of these mosquitoes will really be telling," Dever said. "You could get to that threshold of entrenchment where the eggs are too abundant for an eradication program to be successful."

The tropical mosquitoes are stealthy, aggressive and bold, usually biting legs, ankles and feet, where they cannot be heard buzzing. The insects will also bite during the daytime. These are habits different from the native mosquito, which spreads West Nile virus.

Experts are not sure why the tropical mosquitoes are coming to Orange County and California now. It doesn't appear, however, that hot weather is a factor. They are in a dozen California counties, from Alameda to San Diego.

"These mosquitoes are very difficult to control -- harder to control than (the mosquitoes that carry) West Nile virus," said Vicki Kramer, head of the California Department of Public Health's vector-borne disease division.

[This report provides a good update on the sites where these 2 species have been found very recently in Orange county, with excellent maps of those locations. Both of these _Aedes_ species continue to be found in new localities in Southern California this year (2015), and some of these California localities are places where _Ae. aegypti_ and _Ae. albopictus_ have been reported in earlier ProMED-mail posts.

Finding of potential vector mosquitoes in Anaheim, just 0.5 mi (1km) from the Disneyland Resort is of concern, since it is a major tourist destination, with individuals coming there from countries where dengue, chikungunya and Zika viruses are being transmitted currently. Although the risk of imported dengue, chikungunya or Zika viruses sparking a local outbreak is low, it is not zero. In recent years, there has been local dengue virus transmission in Florida involving _Ae. aegypti_ and in Long Island, New York, transmitted by _Ae. albopictus_. Chikungunya virus has also been transmitted locally in Florida recently. These small outbreaks have been initiated by the arrival of viremic individuals from endemic countries.

The fact that the vector mosquito populations in California are low certainly significantly reduces the risk of an outbreak with ongoing transmission being initiated there. The aggressive and well-organized surveillance and control measures being carried out in California will likely keep those vector populations at a low level.
