Emergency message: Classical swine fever in Russia
--------------------------------------------------
(Date of previous outbreak of classical swine fever in Russia reported to
the OIE: September 2003).
Information received on 27 Jan 2005 from Dr Evgueny A. Nepoklonov, Head of
the Main Veterinary Department, Ministry of Agriculture and Food, Moscow:
Report date: 27 Jan 2005.
Precise identification of agent: according to the phylogenetic analysis of
the virus involved, the isolated strain ('Bogolubovo-2005') is suspected to
belong to group 2, that has not been detected yet on the territory of the
Russian Federation. The investigations into the properties of the isolated
strain are not ended. The pathogenicity of the strain for pigs will be
investigated.
Date of first confirmation of the event: 17 Jan 2005.
Date of start of the event: 27 Dec 2004.
Nature of diagnosis: clinical, post-mortem and laboratory.
Morbidity rate: over 80 percent.
Mortality rate: over 53 percent.
Details of outbreak:
First administrative division: Vladimir region.
Lower administrative division: Suzdal district.
Type of epidemiological unit: farm.
Name of the location: Novoe Selo village.
Number of animals in the outbreak:
susceptible: 300;
deaths: 160;
destroyed: 140.
Description of affected population: herd of pigs aged between 3 and 5
months. Small farm of village type. The animals were vaccinated against
classical swine fever probably using a non-active vaccine [since only live
attenuated CSF vaccines are known to be currently in use, the report
refers, probably, to a vaccine which lost its activity/efficacy due to
deficient storage or another reason. - Mod. AS] or a wrong vaccination
protocol.
Source of outbreak: unknown or inconclusive. There are evidences that
increased mortality would be caused by wrong feeding. For this reason the
determination of the strain pathogenicity will be investigated.
Control measures undertaken:
- stamping out;
- quarantine;
- vaccination (number of vaccinated animals: 2,008 pigs);
- disinfection of infected premises.
... Further details will be published in the next issue of Weekly Disease
Information, available on line as from Friday 28 Jan 2005 afternoon
