Another child has tested positive for H5N1 avian influenza virus infection,
which has already killed 4 children in Turkey, the health ministry said on
Tuesday [17 Jan 2006]. This latest case brings the total number of
confirmed H5N1 cases among humans in Turkey to 21 over the past 2 weeks,
including the 4 deaths. The Ministry said the child had tested positive
while undergoing tests in the eastern Turkish city of Erzurum. Like the 4
people who died, the infected child comes from the town of Dogubayazit near
the Iranian border. Samples of the child's tissues have been sent to a
laboratory in London for further tests, the Ministry said.
Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan said on Tuesday that 5 patients with H5N1 had
recovered and had been discharged from hospital. Many of the remaining 12
people are reported to be stable, but doctors said on Tuesday the condition
of the 5 year old brother of a girl who died on Sunday, was serious. "He is
in intensive care and his treatment is continuing, with him attached to
respiratory equipment. I cannot say he is critical but he is serious,"
Huseyin Avni Sahin, chief doctor at Van hospital in eastern Turkey, told
Reuters.
The 4 dead Turkish children are the 1st human bird flu fatalities outside
China and South ast Asia since the virus re-emerged in late 2003.

3 people, including a child, have been urgently admitted into the Mugla
town hospital after they had been in contact with dead hens that had tested
positive for the bird flu virus, according to the online edition of Hurriyet.
These cases were registered in Mugla province in Turkey, which afterwards
began mass capturing and killing of poultry. However, veterinary teams met
strong resistance from the local people while trying to find and capture
hens, ducks and turkeys. Despite that fact, the teams managed to destroy
800 birds, and in the last 24 hours the total [cumulative] number of
poultry killed in the region is 1500.
