An 8-year-old Thai girl and a dog were confirmed to have been infected with
Asia's deadly bird flu on Sunday [3 Oct 2004], as the country battled a 2nd
major outbreak of the virus this year [2004], authorities said.
Dutch researchers reported last month [September 2004] that cats can get
the avian influenza virus, which means pets are at risk of getting and
spreading the disease.
The girl, from the northern province of Phetchabun, brings to 4 the number
of people in Thailand infected with the H5N1 virus, which has killed 20
Vietnamese and 10 Thais. "Lab tests confirmed twice she was definitely
infected by H5N1," Deputy Public Health Minister Anutin Charnvirakul said
in a statement. The girl has been in poor condition since being sent to the
hospital last Monday [27 Sep 2004], Anutin said.
Among the other cases, a 32-year-old woman is being treated in the hospital
in the northern province of Khamphaeng Phet. She is the sister of a woman
who died of bird flu last month [September 2004] and is believed to be
Thailand's 1st probable case of human transmission of the virus. Health
authorities say there is no evidence to suggest the case could set off a
human pandemic.
A man who raised fighting cocks in Prachinburi province died of bird flu in
early September [2004].
Thai authorities also confirmed on Sunday [3 Oct 2004] the country's 1st
case of bird flu in a dog. "We have found that a dog was infected by the
H5N1 virus," Health Ministry spokeswoman Nittaya Chanruangmahaphol said,
adding that the case was confirmed by laboratory tests conducted at 2 Thai
universities. She gave no further details, but Thai newspapers reported on
Sunday that the dog was still alive.
A campaign, ordered by Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra to wipe out the
virus by the end of October 2004, began last week [final week of September
2004], with hundreds of thousands of volunteers and officials from the
Health and Agriculture ministries being mobilized. So far, 92 areas in 28
provinces are under bird flu watch, of which, 50 areas were confirmed to
have been hit by the virus, Livestock Department officials say.
Tens of millions of fowl have been slaughtered in the effort to eradicate
the disease since it swept across much of Asia early this year [2004].
For a few months, it looked like it was being defeated, but it sprang up
again in Thailand and Viet Nam in July 2004.

Thailand finds bird flu in dog for the 1st time
-----------------------------------------
Asia's deadly bird flu has been found in a dog for the 1st time in
Thailand, authorities said on Sunday [3 Oct 2004].
Health Ministry spokeswoman Nittaya Chanruangmahaphol told Reuters that the
H5N1 virus was discovered in a dog in the southeastern province of
Prachinburi, where previous cases had been found in humans and poultry.
"We have found that a dog was infected by the H5N1 virus," she said, adding
that the case was confirmed by laboratory tests conducted at 2 Thai
universities. She gave no further details, but Thai newspapers reported on
Sunday [3 Oct 2004] that the dog was still alive.
Thailand reported its 1st probable case of human transmission of bird flu
last week [final week of September 2004].
A campaign, ordered by Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra to wipe out the
virus by the end of October 2004, started last week [final week of
September 2004]. So far, 92 areas in 28 provinces are under bird flu watch,
of which, 50 areas were confirmed to have been hit by the virus, Livestock

[While these articles discuss another human case and a case in a dog, the 2
cases are not related as they have occurred in different provinces -- the
dog in the south of the country, the new human case in the north of the
country. That being said, the transmission to pets will make it
potentially more difficult to eliminate the disease. - Mods.TG/MPP]
