Indonesia: Number of Human Avian Influenza Cases Rising
-------------------------------------------------------
Indonesia's human cases of avian influenza are occurring with
increasing frequency, prompting the government to step up monitoring
efforts aimed at slowing the spread of the virus among animals, the
agriculture minister said. Humans are contracting the deadly H5N1
strain of the virus at a faster pace, causing more deaths,
Agriculture Minister Anton Apriantono told reporters in Jakarta
before attending a cabinet meeting on bird flu, without elaborating.
"We will step up preventive efforts, be more proactive. We will do
checking even on areas that haven't seen any cases of dead poultry.
Information dissemination about bird flu will be stepped up."
Indonesia has the 2nd-highest number of avian influenza cases among
humans in the world. [As of 13 Feb 2006, Viet Nam has 93
laboratory-confirmed cases, with 42 deaths. - Mod.CP]. The H5N1 virus
has killed at least 18 people of the 25 people it has infected in
Indonesia. Health authorities say they are concerned the virus will
mutate into a form easily transmitted among humans, causing a deadly
global pandemic. The country's suspected 6th cluster of human
infections, involving 2 adults and their 2-year-old daughter, has
heightened concerns. "We have the highest [number of] clusters in the
world. And the higher the number of clusters, the higher possibility
of human to human (infection)," Health Minister Siti Fadilah Supari
told reporters before attending the same meeting.
The World Health Organization has said public awareness about the
dangers of handling diseased poultry needs to be increased,
particularly in urban areas where there is a greater density of both
human and fowl populations. About 30 million households in villages
live alongside more than 200 million fowl.
Indonesia aims to raise the number of designated bird flu hospitals
to 100 from 44 by the end of this year [2006] and plans to boost
stocks of the antiviral Tamiflu, Minister of People's Welfare
Aburizal Bakrie said on Tue 14 Feb 2006.

[It should not be assumed that the higher the number of apparent
clusters of human infections the greater the possibility of
human-to-human transmission of infection. The evidence so far
suggests that humans predominantly contract infection directly from
diseased poultry, and that clusters merely indicate a common source
of infection. Since virus mutations occur more or less at random, in
the absence of an external directional force, the probability of
evolution of a mutant virus transmissible among humans is related
more to the total number of replications of the viral genome (in both
fowl and/or humans) rather than the number of clusters of human
infections. The greater risk of emergence of a human pandemic virus
remains interaction between the avian H5N1 virus and a conventional
human influenza virus by recombination or reassortment of genome
sub-units. - Mod.CP].
