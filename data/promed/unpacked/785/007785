Livestock was beginning to move to British slaughterhouses today, even as
more farms were declared unsafe and 6 new cases of Foot and Mouth Disease
(FMD) were reported in England and Scotland.
The discovery of new cases by officials of the Ministry of Agriculture,
Fisheries and Food (MAFF) has brought the total number of affected farms
across the United Kingdom to 76. The most significant discoveries of the
disease were at 2 farms bordering Dartmoor national park in Devon, where 50
000 cattle graze on common land.
An outbreak was confirmed at Dunna Bridge Farm, Two Bridges and fears were
increased today with a second case confirmed at a nearby farm at Widecombe
in the Moor. The potential for the disease to have spread to the cattle
leading to an enforced mass slaughter operation was described as "nightmare
scenario" by the south west regional National Farmers' Union director,
Anthony Gibson.
While the disease continued to take hold in some areas, the government said
unaffected farms could begin to transport their animals to slaughterhouses
under close supervision and under licenses.
Farmers--whose livestock has plummeted in value over the last 11 days of
enforced immobility--have been clamoring to apply for licenses. In
Aberdeenshire alone, 71 licenses have been applied for. The British
Horseracing Board and Jockey Club today announced racing in unaffected
areas would resume tomorrow (the first time since a ban was introduced last
week).
However, music magazine NME warned some outdoor summer festivals might be
canceled due to the disease. There are hopes the crisis may soon be under
control, as all but one of the confirmed outbreaks in Britain were
conclusively linked to diseased animals elsewhere. Yesterday 5 new
cases--at farms in Bishop Auckland, County Durham; Hatherleigh, Devon;
Highampton, Devon; St Weonards, Herefordshire; and near Beattock, Dumfries
and Galloway--were also believed to be linked to previous cases.
The agriculture minister, Nick Brown, said measures were already in place
to start moving unaffected cattle, sheep and pigs to abattoirs, while
slaughtering was already underway in parts of Scotland.
Hundreds of special licences have been given to farmers in such areas, and
one supermarket promised shoppers fresh supplies of British pork as early
as today.
The chief veterinary officer, Jim Scudamore, said 14 092 animals had been
slaughtered so far, while another 60 000 would also be culled. In France,
all movement of sheep, pigs, goats, and horses has been stopped for 2
weeks, although officials at the EU maintain the crisis has not yet reached
epidemic proportions.
Meanwhile, banned spinal cord has been found at an abattoir in Blackpool in
a consignment of imported beef from Holland. Spinal cord is included in the
list of specified risk material (SRM) which is thought to be at greatest
risk of carrying BSE infectivity. Under EU rules, it must be removed when
the animal is slaughtered.
Europe's veterinary experts will today consider authorizing the use of
vaccine to counter the spread of FMD. But the policy is still seen as a
last resort, too costly, and is likely to be rejected.

As of 22:00 GMT the BBC has announced 7 new cases [of FMD for today,
bringing the overall total to 81 cases, 79 at 1200 GMT which is what the
most recent table presented by ProMED-mail reflected.

European Union veterinary experts on Tuesday ordered all livestock markets
closed for 2 weeks in the 15-nation bloc in an effort to contain Foot and
Mouth Disease (FMD). The EU panel said livestock transports would be
allowed between farms and direct to slaughterhouses, but all markets and
gathering points for cattle, pigs and sheep would be banned.
The panel also extended until 27 Mar 2001 a ban on all exports of meat,
livestock and milk products from Britain and said the tires of vehicles
arriving from Britain to other EU nations must be disinfected.
The measures are set to come into force once they are formally adopted by
the European Commission, a decision EU spokesman Gregor Kreuzhuber said
would come this week.
Although no confirmed cases have been found outside Britain, the new
restrictions reflected deep fears the livestock virus could spread through
herds in mainland Europe.
The curbs were approved despite Britain's message to the meeting that the
outbreak of FMD may be close to peaking. "The information he gave was
rather reassuring," European Commission spokesman Thorsten Muench of a
briefing by Britain's representative on the panel. "The (British)
authorities expect a peak today, tomorrow or through this week."
Several EU nations were pushing for tougher action. Italy had demanded a
complete ban on all livestock movement across borders within the EU, but
the panel of veterinary experts did not go that far.

Farmers desperate to move livestock free of the disease have been granted
special licences to take their animals to abattoirs. But the number of
qualifying farms is dwindling, as 76 cases of foot-and-mouth have been
confirmed in Britain.
Since the ban on livestock movement was imposed 11 days ago, healthy
animals have been stuck on farms losing value. Farmers have been rushing to
apply for the licences. In Aberdeenshire alone 71 licences have been
applied for. But those living within 6 miles of an affected area cannot apply.
Vets from as far away as Australia and Canada [and USA have been drafted
in to help trace thousands of animals, including 100 000 sheep. [Providing
them with much needed hands-on experience. - Mod.MHJ
In France all movement of sheep, pigs, goats, and horses has been banned
for 2 weeks.
But EU Consumer Protection Commissioner David Byrne has insisted the
current crisis was still short of epidemic proportions and has ruled out a
European-wide vaccination program to prevent the spread of the disease.
Such a program would involve vaccinating 300 million animals every 6 months
and would make it impossible to distinguish between livestock which had
been immunized and those which had contracted the disease.
Mr Byrne told BBC Radio 4's Today program: "You would then debilitate the
value of your livestock herds throughout the European Union and lose the
opportunity of trading on the world-wide market." But he did say there was
a case for using limited vaccination programs as a "fire wall" to control
outbreaks and 30 million vaccinations were available.
Checks are continuing to see if the disease has spread to free-ranging
livestock on Dartmoor after an outbreak at a local farm. Government vets
said they believe the outbreak, at the Duchy of Cornwall farm inside the
national park in Devon, is linked to previous cases. But if it is not
linked, it could mean that up to 40 000 cattle and sheep on the moor would
have to be culled. The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAFF)
said it had ruled out a cull of the Dartmoor ponies.

[Some 30 years ago L.P. Smith and I did a paper exercise on the potential
benefits of using vaccination to stop FMD using 5 outbreaks in the previous
10 years. It utilized various "fire wall" responses. In 4 of these models,
vaccination would have added significantly to the problems and expense and
made no difference to the total number of herds affected. The fifth
involved not unusual numbers, but was linear in time (if I remember
correctly, it was spread over many weeks, even months) and only then might
vaccination have significantly reduced the number of herds affected. From
what I have seen of this epidemic, a "fire wall" campaign would not have
had any benefits and would certainly have presented many long-term costs.
Seen in historical context, this epidemic has had somewhat more outbreaks
than might be expected; but considering the epidemiological pattern
utilizing markets it is modest, thanks to the outstanding efforts of the
MAFF vets and others. - Mod.MHJ
