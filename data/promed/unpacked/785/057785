China's Ministry of Health reports today that there are a total of 393
cases of rabies in September. The figure is up by 37 per cent compared with
the same period of 2005. There have been 318 human deaths.
Experts say that the current rabies epidemic in China is mainly due to an
apparent increase of people who raise dogs, a severe deficiency of
knowledge by the public about rabies, and the failure to seek treatment by
those bitten by an infected dog.
According to the report, China is one of the worst rabies-endemic countries
in the world, second only to India. Beijing alone has recorded more than 70
000 clinical cases of rabies during the first half of this year [2006].
The official statistics show from January to September 2006 a cumulative
figure of 2254 confirmed cases of rabies, up by 29.7 per cent compared with
the same period in 2005.

[2] China - rabies vaccinations in Beijing

Enjoying time at home and playing with a pet has its price -- people bitten
by dogs and needing rabies vaccines in Beijing rose sharply during the
National Day holidays. The Beijing University People's Hospital received
more than 200 people for rabies vaccinations on Wednesday and Thursday.
Queues were seen outside the vaccination room. From Sunday to Wednesday,
the China-Japan Friendship Hospital inoculated 500 people, including 100
bitten by dogs.
The daily injection rate was 20 per cent higher than normal, said a doctor
surnamed Su with the China-Japan Friendship Hospital. Most people were
adults who played with their dogs at home and some were bitten in their
sleep, according to the Beijing Morning Post.
An old woman interviewed by the paper said she was bitten during a dog
fight in a lift. Some people were bitten by unchained dogs being taken for
a walk by neighbors. In Wangjing and Tiantong residential compounds in
northern Beijing, about 30 percent of residents did not chain their dogs
outside their home.
Rabies, often spread by dog bites, attacks the nervous system and is fatal
in humans if not treated before the onset of symptoms. The virus can infect
people through bites and scratches no matter how serious the injury. People
bitten or injured must wash the wound with water containing 20 per cent
soap for 20 minutes and go to hospital immediately, said doctor Zhang
Haicheng with the People's Hospital.
Instant vaccination is needed not only for dog bites, but also for bites
from cats, bats, and other wild animals, despite previous vaccinations,
said another doctor, Wang Chuanlin. Five consecutive injections were needed
in every case, warned doctors.
China ranks second in the world after India in terms of the number of
rabies cases, according to the Ministry of Health. Every year, more than 50
000 people around the world die of the disease, with most of them in
developing countries. The incidence of rabies has been rising throughout
the country this year, official figures have shown.
The number of vaccinations in Beijing rose from 8000 in January to 15 000
in June, with a total of 69 332 in the first half year, according to the
municipal center for disease control and prevention. The health ministry
reported 1874 rabies cases, including 1735 deaths, in the country during
the first 8 months of 2006, up 29 per cent over the same period of 2005.
The ministry's website shows that 2660 people died from rabies in 2004,
while in 1996 there were only 159 reported fatalities. Rabies was the
second most common deadly infectious disease after tuberculosis in 2005,
accounting for 19 per cent of the total deaths. China has some 150 million
pet dogs, according to estimates.
Experts say pet owners who abandon their dogs are mainly responsible for
the increase in the disease as stray dogs that have not been vaccinated are
most likely to contract rabies. To curb rising rabies cases, local
governments have tried various measures. In Mouding County of south west
China's Yunnan Province, the government slaughtered 50 000 dogs after 3
deaths were reported, sparking a nationwide debate.
The Beijing municipal government requires rabies cases or suspected rabies
cases to be immediately reported to the health department. Dog owners in
Beijing will face harsh penalties in the future if they raise their pets in
violation of regulations. Their dogs may be confiscated and they may be
fined up to 5000 yuan (625 US dollars) if they keep a dog without a permit,
fail to carry out annual health checks on their pets, keep big dogs in
downtown areas, have more than one dog at one home, or take them to places
where dogs are not permitted.
The health ministry will also strengthen prevention of rabies in rural
areas, where dogs are not widely vaccinated and medical treatment for
people is inadequate, said vice health minister Jiang Zuojun.

[Public awareness campaigns against rabies seem to work somehow in China's
capital city. Compulsory vaccination and registration of pet dogs have been
the 2 most effective measures for control of rabies in endemic countries. A
