A Tulsa, Oklahoma, dentist is responsible for the nation's 1st transmission of hepatitis C between patients in a dental office. Doctor Scott Harrington's dental practice was shut down in March [2013] when it was discovered he used rusty equipment and his staff reused needles. Current and former patients were notified, and health officials recommended that they have blood tests.

More than 4000 people have been tested so far, and 89 came back positive for hepatitis C, 5 for hepatitis B, and 4 for human immunodeficiency virus infection.

[These results in themselves do not prove that the infections were received during treatment at Dr. Scott Harrington's clinic, although it seems likely. They need to be supplemented by genomic studies to identify the strains involved. In the absence of information on the frequency of infection by these pathogenic agents in the general population, it is premature to attribute blame. Further information is awaited. It would be interesting to know what form of compensation is envisaged for Dr. Scott Harrington's unfortunate patients if the link is established unequivocally.
