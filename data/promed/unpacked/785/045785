There is a disease called Alvsborg disease that has been reported in moose
and possibly other ruminants in Sweden. The gross lesions include ulcers
of the oral mucosa and GI tract. I do not recall much about the CNS
lesions or whether the clinical signs have been observed. The disease is
thought to be caused by multiple factors. Hope this is of some help.
