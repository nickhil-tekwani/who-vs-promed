Child in Penang dies of suspected hand, foot and mouth disease
--------------------------------------------
PENANG: A baby from Teluk Kumbar (Penang) died of suspected hand, foot and
mouth disease (HFMD) 2 weeks ago. Deputy state health director Dr Azmi
Shapie said [that the baby, suspected to have viral myocarditis, died at
the Penang Hospital a day after he was admitted. He said the Department was
investigating whether the baby's death was caused by a coxsackie virus or
the more severe enterovirus-71 (EV71).
Dr Shapie said yesterday [Mon 28 May, "Two other children from Teluk
Kumbar who were admitted for observation have been discharged after their
condition improved." Coxsackie virus [infection is associated with the
mild form of the disease, whereas EV71 causes viral meningitis and
encephalitis, [either of which may be fatal. HFMD is a common illness of
babies and children, which is spread through direct contact with nose and
throat discharges or stool of an infected child. Typical symptoms are
fever, sores in the mouth, and rashes with blisters on the palms of the
hands and soles of the feet.
HFMD claimed 2 lives in Johor Baru, one in Kuala Lumpur and another in
Kedah, in October 2000. Dr Azmi said [that no further HFMD cases had been
reported from Teluk Kumbar, adding that most cases in Penang were mild and
their number was relatively small compared with previous years.
