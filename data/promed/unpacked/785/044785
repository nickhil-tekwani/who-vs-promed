South Dakota is reporting an outbreak of salmonellosis associated with baby chicks. 3 cases have been reported in the southeastern part of the state and one in the southwest. One case was a child younger than 4; the others were adults.

Salmonellosis is a bacterial infection and one of the most common causes of gastroenteritis. The bacteria are widely distributed in the food chain and environment and often contaminate raw meats, eggs, unpasteurized milk, and cheese products. Poultry, swine, cattle, rodents, songbirds, and pets such as iguanas, tortoises, turtles, terrapins, chicks, dogs, and cats, as well as humans, can carry the bacteria.

Children are especially susceptible because they frequently put their fingers into their mouths and because their immune systems are still developing. Pregnant women, the elderly, people with HIV/AIDS, and other immunocompromised individuals are also at higher risk.

Symptoms may include mild or severe diarrhea, fever, and occasionally vomiting. Bloodstream infections can be quite serious, particularly in the very young or elderly.

Take the following precautions to prevent salmonella infection:
- Don't let kids under 5 handle poultry or items contaminated by poultry. Other high risk groups should also avoid handling poultry or contaminated items.
- Thoroughly wash hands after handling poultry or their droppings.
- Don't eat or drink around poultry or their living areas.
- Don't wash food or water dishes for poultry in the kitchen sink.
- Don't let poultry live inside your home.

[Small animals such as chicks, ducklings, mice, hedgehogs, and baby turtles are not uncommon vehicles for salmonellosis for 2 reasons: they are small enough to handle and they carry salmonellae. Two ways to minimize the risk: aggressive hand washing after contact and choose other pets such as dogs or cats. - Mod.LL
