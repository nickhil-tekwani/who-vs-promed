An entire shipment of Australian sheep stranded in the Pakistani port city of Karachi for several weeks has been culled by authorities. The sheep had been turned away from Bahrain after authorities said the flock of 28 600 carried disease.

When they arrived in Karachi, authorities there also claimed testing showed the sheep were contaminated and ordered the destruction of the animals. A court order halted the cull after the deaths of 7600 sheep, and an independent test carried out in Britain showed the flock to be disease-free. But Karachi authorities have rejected these tests and resumed the cull. All 21 000 sheep have now been killed. There are claims the animals had been brutally treated.

The cull was carried out in secret, and the owners of the sheep, P.K Livestock, were not allowed to be present. A spokesman said the Australian High Commission in Islamabad was shocked by the move.

The incident has renewed calls for a total end to Australia's live export trade, which is worth about USD one billion a year and employs around 10 000 people.

Australia suspended live cattle exports to Indonesia for a month last year [2011] after a Four Corners documentary revealed mistreatment inside its abattoirs, only reinstating the trade under a strict new licensing system.

After remaining a hot topic for local and Australian media, the saga of imported Australian sheep has ended after authorities concerned culled all animals here on Saturday [20 Oct 2012]. The Livestock Department of the Government of Sindh culled 11 306 infected [see comment] sheep in 2 days. The process was initiated Friday [19 Oct 2012] morning. Talking to Business Recorder, Kazi Jan Muhammad, Deputy Commissioner District Malir confirmed that all the live, imported animals were culled by 5:30 pm on Saturday.

The number of culled animals was 18 906 out of the imported over 20 400 animals, showing around 1500 missing. This was the number of sheep reported missing after reaching Karachi, while the number of missing animals could increase to over 3000 if the same was counted since the departure of the consignment carrying 22 000 sheep from Bahrain after rejection.

According to veterinary experts of the provincial government, the imported sheep carrying Orf [contagious ecthyma] needed to be disposed of, which is normal practice in the world to avoid the spread of the disease in animals. In Pakistan, Orf has not been reported in local animals before [see comment].

The Australian exporter had visited Pakistan since the issue was highlighted in local media and started a campaign through press conferences and media interactions to convince the people concerned and the authorities that these sheep were not infected or sick. However, the officials of Wellard, the foreign company, failed to do so, apparently because of multiple reasons such as rejection of the consignment earlier by the Bahrain government, the overnight approval of Pakistan for the "Supply Chain Assurance System" of Australia, serious violation of rules while importing these animals in Pakistan, reports of provincial laboratories and experts' unchanged stance, the Pakistani ambassador's letter regarding the official version of the Bahrain government over the rejection of the sheep consignment, and lastly the withdrawal of the case from court by the importer/petitioner.

The saga of the Australian sheep that were supposedly infected with a range of diseases and then were found not to be appears to be drawing to a bloody and miserable close. From beginning to end, the entire episode has been a display of never-ending incompetence by all concerned, and nobody emerges well from the tale. There are 11 000 sheep left, apparently in reasonable health, which are now being slaughtered by the Sindh Livestock Department in a manner that leaves much to be desired and appears not to comply with religious custom and practice relative to the slaughter of animals. The Australian High Commission is said to be shocked as is the importer of the animals, Tariq Mehmood Butt. As the weeks have passed since the sheep 1st arrived, having allegedly been rejected by the port authorities in Bahrain because some of them had Orf disease, the story has become ever more tangled and contradictory.

At one point, the sheep were said to have foot-and-mouth disease and even anthrax, a deadly disease that has in the past been developed for biological warfare. Agencies tasked with testing the sheep gave conflicting diagnoses. Confused and confusing statements came to the media from all sides, creating a picture of incoherence for the viewing and reading public. The Australian exporter of the sheep, Wellard Rural Exports, maintains that the sheep were disease-free when they left Australia. There is potential damage to the Australian meat-export industry because its veracity and competence regarding animal health have been called into question. There is even dispute over whether there has been an out-of-court settlement to compensate the importer, Mr Butt, who is going to be considerably out of pocket. All in all, the episode has been a disaster for all concerned, be they in Australia, Bahrain, or Pakistan. At the very least, we need to see a root-and-branch review of veterinary services in our ports, and an equally searching review of the quality of lab-testing in our various universities and provincial veterinary departments.

[The Sun 21 Oct 2012 editorial of the Pakistani daily The News (item 3 above) describes adequately the event, which has now reached its end. Lessons will have to be drawn by all.

Since trade, politics or legal issues are not included among ProMED-mail's objectives, commentary will be restricted to the veterinary/scientific aspects of the saga.

Of the disease agents/entities mentioned during the evolving event, namely Contagious ecthyma (Scabby mouth), actinomyces, salmonella, _E. coli_, anthrax and FMD (and, briefly, also PPR), only scabby mouth emerged as a factual one. This agent was the cause for Bahrain's refusal to accept the consignment, which was rerouted and eventually reached Karachi a month after leaving West Australia (Fremantle).

Contagious ecthyma (CE, also known as scabby mouth, sore mouth, contagious pustular dermatitis and orf) is a parapoxvirus infection of sheep, goats and several wild small ruminants, which may also cause skin infection in humans. CE is distributed globally wherever sheep and goats are raised. Information on its presence in a country may be found in the country's annual reports to OIE's disease information system (articles 5, 6, 7 in the annual reports deal with "non OIE-Listed diseases/infections").

Though CE is not included in OIE's list and Code, which prescribes international trade health requirements, some countries refuse entrance of animal consignments which include clinical CE cases, particularly if destined for breeding/fattening. CE was the cause for the cessation of live sheep trade from Australia to Saudi Arabia for several years; it was eventually agreed that Australian sheep bound for Saudi Arabia be vaccinated against CE and pre-loading clinical examinations attesting absence of lesions be applied. Despite such precautions, CE is still known to manifest in some sheep and goats upon arrival, due to stressful conditions.

To prevent problems at destinations, Australia signed a Memoranda of Understanding (MOU) with 10 countries in the Middle East and Africa. A key element of these MOUs is that animals be unloaded on arrival regardless of their health status. Probably, such an agreement has not been signed with Pakistan (and Bahrain?).

On 25 Sep 2012, Western Australian Farmers Federation President Dale Park advised Australian live sheep exporters that rather than violate the terms of memoranda of understanding in knocking the shipment back, they should instead focus on Middle Eastern markets which have been long-standing customers. He specified 4 markets. "We can't afford another fiasco like we've got going on in Pakistan, so the best way to avoid that is don't go back to the place that caused you trouble," AAP quoted Mr Park as saying (see at http://tinyurl.com/8ex6hdr).

Australia's Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry (DAFF) web-site includes the page "Live Animal Export Trade" at http://www.daff.gov.au/animal-plant-health/welfare/export-trade. One of the documents there is "Australian Standards for the Export of Livestock (Version 2.3) 2011 and Australian Position Statement on the Export of Livestock," available at http://www.daff.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0010/1904365/australian-standards-v2.3.pdf. Table A3.1.2 of the document titled "Sheep and goat rejection criteria" (page 67) specifies under "Head" 11 reasons for the rejection of sheep for export, including "Scabby mouth."

Both statements in Pakistan's Business Recorder (item 2) -- namely "the imported sheep carrying Orf needed to be disposed of, which is normal practice in the world to avoid the spread of the disease in animals," and "in Pakistan, Orf has not been reported in local animals before this" -- are devoid of factual basis. To the best of our knowledge, the stamping out policy undertaken in Karachi is unprecedented. As to CE in Pakistan, see ref. 1.

In Pakistan's annual report for 2011, the disease entity Contagious pustular dermatitis (CE) appears under "Unreported non OIE-Listed diseases" and not under "Non OIE-Listed diseases absent in Pakistan during the reporting period or never reported." This may be indicative of deficient surveillance.

For pictures of contagious ecthyma in animals, see http://ksvm.agri.huji.ac.il/yeruham/gallery1_3.php.

Humans are usually infected by direct contact with animal lesions, for example, children in petting zoos/parks, usually by letting infected lambs lick their fingers. It is not transmitted by consumption of meat or milk, direct contact with lesions being the common infection route. Most infections in humans are localized and heal spontaneously; however, large, poorly healing lesions can occur in people who are immunosuppressed.
