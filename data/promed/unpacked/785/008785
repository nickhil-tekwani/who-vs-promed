Maize disease wrecks fields
---------------------------
The aggressive maize lethal necrosis disease (MLND) is wiping out maize fields in Babati district [Manyara Region] and this is likely to cause an acute shortage of the country's staple food in the region. If measures are not taken to halt the spread of the disease, farmers are likely to experience low production.

It is said that more than 1760 families in Babati had no harvest last [2013] season following MLND attacks on their fields.

A farmer pointed out that extension officer's directives [on how] to control the spread of the disease haven't rendered any help to farmers because the disease has continued to worsen. MLND has caused great panic among farmers with the majority contemplating alternative crops.

District Agriculture Officer Jetrida Kyekaka said, "This is a new disease both to farmers and agriculture experts and [it] is spreading very fast. The only option to halt the disease is to come up with new maize varieties which are resistant to the MLND."

Agricultural scientists with Serian Agriculture Research Institute (SARI) said there was still no evidence whether MLND was airborne, soil borne, or seed borne, and that burning infected crops was the best way to contain the spread of the viral attack as scientists continue to find other alternatives to mitigate the crisis.

[Maize lethal necrosis (MLN) caused by co-infection of _Maize chlorotic mottle virus_ (MCMV, genus _Machlomovirus_), transmitted by chrysomelid beetle vectors, and either _Maize dwarf mosaic virus_ (MDMV, genus _Potyvirus_) or _Wheat streak mosaic virus_ (WSMV, genus _Tritimovirus_) has been reported from the Americas and some locations in Europe.

MLN as well as MCMV were reported for the 1st time in Africa from Kenya in 2012 (ProMED-mail post 20130123.1510727) and the disease is spreading in the region. WSMV has not been reported from Africa, but MDMV is known to occur in the region. MDMV is closely related to _Sugarcane mosaic virus_ (SCMV, genus _Potyvirus_), also present in the area, and both are transmitted by a number of aphid species. SCMV has been reported as the co-infecting potyvirus in Kenya, but transmission in maize seed was previously only reported for MDMV, and not SCMV. However, seed transmission of MLN in Africa is being claimed (but is yet to be proven) and would imply that at least one of its viruses is seed transmitted and that infected seedlings acquire the 2nd additional virus from infectious insect vectors present locally. Thus, the 2 viruses involved in Africa may be MCMV, which is not seed transmitted, and either seed transmitted MDMV (undifferentiated from SCMV in the diagnosis) or a new strain of SCMV that can be seed transmitted in maize. High genetic divergence of African SCMV strains has been reported (see ProMED-mail post 20140604.2518403) and may support the latter hypothesis.

Symptoms of the individual viruses are synergistically enhanced in MLN and may include leaf mottling and necrosis, distortion of ears, absence of kernels, failure to produce tassels, as well as stunting, premature aging, and death of plants. Symptoms may disappear during the growing season leaving plants with latent infections but reduced yield as virus reservoirs and making disease monitoring difficult. Infectious vector insects may be carried by wind over long distances. Disease management may include crop rotation, certified clean seeds, control of vector species and weedy reservoir hosts, and use of crop cultivars or hybrids with reduced sensitivity to the viruses. A resistance breeding programme has been set up in Kenya screening a large set of diverse pre-commercial hybrids from public and private institutions.

MLN was reported for the 1st time in Tanzania last year (2013; see ProMED-mail post 20130403.1620327).
