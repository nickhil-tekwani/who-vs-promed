[Nipah virus now occurs in four states in the country. This is the first time
the virus has been reported in an eastern state. With the addition of Johor
and now Kelantan states, it would seem that there has been widespread
movement of infected pigs in the early phase of the outbreak. - Mod. CYC
[Has anyone considered the possibility that the spread of Nipah virus will not
be contained and that it will eventually be detected outside Malaysia? - Mod
