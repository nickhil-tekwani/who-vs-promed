Canada: call for elk cull because of increasing bovine TB
---------------------------------------------------------
Bovine tuberculosis carried by wild elk is increasingly threatening
Manitoba cattle herds, causing farmers calling for a cull of the elk.

Cattle and wild elk live in contact with each other around Riding
Mountain National Park in western Manitoba. The elk graze in cattle
pastures bordering the park, sharing hay with cattle and drinking
from the same streams. Recently the number of cases of bovine
tuberculosis increased. 43 elk and 10 white-tailed deer tested
positive for the disease in the last 8 years.

Farmers say the threat is driving down the price of their exported
cattle and forcing them to do costly testing of their herds. A farmer
can lose an entire herd when a cow tests positive. There is also
concern that the disease could be passed to humans.

Farmers are calling for a cull of the elk, either by hunters or
conservation officers, and increased testing of the carcasses.

[Riding Mountain National Park in Canada has similar problems as
Yellowstone National Park in the United States.

Sharing hay can transmit bovine tuberculosis between elk, deer, and
cattle. When cattle acquire the disease it can be quite difficult for
the owner, as selling the cattle requires testing, and in some cases
the owners are required to depopulate their herds.

The problem with the culling, as this article indicates, is that
killing the elk is no guarantee to eradicate the disease as it grows
very slowly in the animals, any animal, whether it is elk or cattle.
It could even be that the elk may be killed and some cattle may be
incubating the disease.
