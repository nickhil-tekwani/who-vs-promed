HANTAVIRUSES - BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA (7)
=====================================
In response to the ongoing discussion on hantavirus caused disease in
Bosnia-Herzegovina:
We have developed recombinant protein based tests for rapid serological
diagnosis of all hantaviruses known to cause infection in humans. We
invite anyone interested to send sera to us for prompt serological
analysis/confirmation.
