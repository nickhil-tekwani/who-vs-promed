Black sea: dolphin deaths
-------------------------
Scientists are sounding the alarm: in the Black Sea, mortalities of
dolphins have been reported; 23 cases have already been recorded,
including 13 in July [2009]. Dolphins lose their orientation and
coordination, some of them ending up on dry land. Similar cases have
been recorded on Turkey's coast of the Black Sea.

Alex Birkun, chairman of the Black Sea Marine Mammal Board, told Blik,
"It seems that this is the result of morbillivirus infection. The main
manifestations of the disease are encephalitis, pneumonia, and
secondary immunodeficiency. The disease is not known to affect humans."

The 1st outbreak of the disease was registered in the Black Sea in
1994, confirmed in laboratories in Canada and Germany. "3 years ago a
wave of disease re-started in the Mediterranean Sea. It seems that now
it has reached the Black Sea," said Birkun.
