PLANT DISEASE NOTES
*******************
A ProMED-mail post
<http://www.healthnet.org/programs/promed.html>
Date: August 13, 1998
From: Pamela Anderson <p.anderson@cgnet.com>

One of the best sources for notices on new and emerging plant diseases is
the Disease Notes section in each issue of the journal _Plant Disease_,
published by the American Phytopathological Society (APS). Disease Notes
are intended to encourage early reporting of new diseases, significant
outbreaks or change in geographical location of diseases, new pathological
races or hosts, and other important observations.
The APS Publications Board and the APS Council, together with the Director
of the APS Office of Public Affairs and Education (OPAE), have given
ProMED-mail permission to post the complete text of individual Disease
Notes which report on diseases threatening food security crops in
developing-economy countries, when permission to post the Disease Note is
also given by the authors. This waiver was granted by APS in recognition
that many colleagues in developing-economy countries do not have access to
journal subscriptions or INTERNET (Disease Notes may also be found on-line
via APSnet). ProMED-mail would like to thank APS for this copyright
waiver.
Thus, if Disease Note authors would like to have their complete report
posted on ProMED-mail, please contact Pamela Anderson <p.anderson@cgnet.com>
And, if our subscribers would like to recommend other professional journals
which we should be monitoring for reports of new and emerging plant
diseases, we would appreciate your suggestions.
