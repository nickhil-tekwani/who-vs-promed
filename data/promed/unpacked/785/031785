The [influenza A (H1N1) 2009] virus was detected in 3 animals of
diverse species at the San Diego Zoo in the fall of 2009, further
broadening the virus's range of animal hosts, according to a letter
published by Emerging Infectious Diseases (EID) [available at
<http://www.cdc.gov/eid/content/17/4/747.htm>. - Mod.TG]

The virus was found in a 12-year-old American badger, a 19-year-old
Bornean binturong, and a 7-year-old black-footed ferret. The badger
and binturong got severely sick with pneumonia and had to be
euthanized, but the ferret had a mild illness and recovered with
antibiotic and fluid treatment.

The source of the infections was not determined but was probably a
human. Ferrets are known to be susceptible to influenza A viruses, but
such cases have not been previously reported in badgers or binturongs,
the report says.

Other species that have been naturally infected with flu viruses
include swine, a dog, cats, turkeys, skunks, cheetahs, and giant
anteaters, and experimental infections have been reported in mice and
cynomolgous macaques.

"The ubiquity of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 and its ability to infect a
diverse range of hosts is worrisome for the health of wildlife and for
the possibility of creating additional reservoirs that could alter the
evolution of subtype H1N1 viruses by applying varied selection
pressures and establishing new ways of generating unique reassortant
strains," the authors say.

[Indeed the number of animals this virus touched, that we are aware
of, is quite frightening in terms of viral reassortment.

But if the ferret had less trouble with this virus than some other
animals, it is perhaps an animal we should be studying to learn why,
not just realize that it is more resistant to influenza type A, but
also really learn what the mechanism is that makes it more resistant
to that type of virus.
