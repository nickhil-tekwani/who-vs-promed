Around 40 people in the [West Bengal] state were suspected to have the symptoms of brucellosis, a bacterial infection transmitted from cattle to humans. Many of them visited the School of Tropical Medicine on Friday [12 Nov 2021] with various symptoms, out of which 5 patients have been admitted to the hospital. Samples have been collected from 30 people. It was learned that those who have been infected mostly administer vaccines to the cattle and rear the animals. They have complained about fever, body ache, and headaches. Infected patients have been kept under observation at the School of Tropical Medicine.

No cattle have reportedly died so far. According to microbiologists, there is hardly any chance that bacteria will transmit from human to human.

Brucellosis is a bacterial disease caused by various _Brucella_ species, which mainly infect cattle, swine, goats, sheep, and dogs. Humans generally acquire the disease through direct contact with infected animals, by eating or drinking contaminated animal products, or by inhaling airborne bacteria.

[Brucellosis in cattle, water buffalo, and bison is caused almost exclusively by _Brucella abortus_. In some countries, the disease in cattle is caused by _B. melitensis_.

Infection spreads rapidly and causes many abortions in unvaccinated cattle. In a herd in which disease is endemic, an infected cow typically aborts only once after exposure; subsequent gestations and lactations appear normal. After exposure, cattle become bacteremic for a short period and develop agglutinins and other antibodies; some cattle resist infection, and a small percentage of infected cows spontaneously recover. A positive serum agglutination test usually precedes an abortion or a normal parturition but may be delayed in approximately 15% of cows. The incubation period may be variable and is inversely related to stage of gestation at time of exposure.

Organisms are shed in milk and uterine discharges, and the cow may become temporarily infertile. Bacteria may be found in the uterus during pregnancy, uterine involution, and, infrequently, for a prolonged time in the nongravid uterus. Shedding from the vagina largely disappears with the cessation of fluids after parturition. Some infected cows that previously aborted shed brucellae from the uterus at subsequent normal parturitions. Organisms are shed in milk for a variable length of time -- in most cattle, for life.

Natural transmission occurs by ingestion of organisms, which are present in large numbers in aborted fetuses, fetal membranes, and uterine discharges. Cattle may ingest contaminated feed and water or may lick contaminated genitals of other animals. Venereal transmission by infected bulls to susceptible cows appears to be rare. Transmission may occur by artificial insemination. Brucellae may enter the body through mucous membranes, conjunctivae, wounds, or intact skin in both people and animals.

Human brucellosis is caused by _B. abortus_, _B. melitensis_ (from sheep and goats), and _B. suis_ (from hogs). _B. canis_ (from dogs) has caused sporadic infections. Generally, _B. melitensis_ and _B. suis_ are more pathogenic than other _Brucella_ species.

Brucellosis in humans is also known as Undulant, Malta, Mediterranean, or Gibraltar Fever. The most common sources of infection are farm animals and raw dairy products. When sheep, goats, and cows are infected, their milk becomes contaminated with the bacteria. If the milk from infected animals is not pasteurized, the infection will be transmitted to people who consume the milk and/or cheese products (http://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/infectious-diseases/gram-negative-bacilli/brucellosis).

The incubation period for brucellosis varies from 5 days to several months and averages 2 wk. Onset may be sudden, with chills and fever, severe headache, joint and low back pain, malaise, and occasionally diarrhea. Or onset may be insidious, with mild prodromal malaise, muscular pain, headache, and pain in the back of the neck, followed by a rise in evening temperature. As the disease progresses, temperature increases to 40-41 deg C [approx. 104-106 deg F], then subsides gradually to normal or near normal with profuse sweating in the morning.

Typically, intermittent fever persists for 1-5 wk, followed by a 2-14-day remission when symptoms are greatly diminished or absent. In some patients, fever may be transient. In others, the febrile phase recurs once or repeatedly in waves (undulations) and remissions over months or years.

After the initial febrile phase, anorexia, weight loss, abdominal and joint pain, headache, backache, weakness, irritability, insomnia, depression, and emotional instability may occur. Constipation is usually pronounced. Splenomegaly appears, and lymph nodes may be slightly or moderately enlarged. Up to 50% of patients have hepatomegaly. - Mod.LL
