[During the past decade, there were outbreaks of H7N7 HPAIV in poultry (Netherlands, Italy, UK, and Germany), all linked to earlier LPAIV incursions in poultry farms. By the end of January 2021, an outbreak of LPAI H7N7 was detected in poultry in Italy, with LPAI viruses recently collected from wild birds in Eurasia. It is unclear where this H7N7 mutated from LPAIV to HPAIV. - Mod.PMB
