The [Qatar] Primary Health Care Corporation (PHCC) has urged all the citizens and residents who are planning to perform Hajj [annual Islamic pilgrimage to Mecca] and Umrah this year [2016] to head to primary health centres to take the necessary vaccinations aimed at the prevention of communicable diseases, including meningitis, pneumonia, and seasonal flu.

Executive Director of the Operating Department at PHCC Dr Samia al-Abdullah has said that the health centres will provide travellers with the full routine vaccinations as recommended in the national immunisation schedules, which usually include diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, polio, measles, mumps, in addition to those needed for travel, such as the meningococcal vaccination for Hajj.

The vaccination campaign comes in line with the recommendations of the Ministry of Public Health, which recommend appropriate vaccinations as the most important way of prevention of infectious diseases, and stress the need to follow the recommendations and guidelines for health and safety.

[The Umrah is a pilgrimage to Mecca, Saudi Arabia, performed by Muslims that can be undertaken at any time of the year, in contrast to the Hajj. The days of Hajj in 2016 begin on Fri 9 Sep and end on Wed 14 Sep. The Hajj is compulsory for every able-bodied Muslim who can afford it; the Umrah is not (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umrah).

Saudi Arabia issues its requirements for entry into Saudi Arabia for the Hajj, which is updated annually. This year's Hajj requirements can be found at https://www.saudiembassy.net/services/hajj_requirements.aspx.

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has also outlined its recommendations for pilgrims during the Hajj (http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2016/select-destinations/saudi-arabia-hajj-pilgrimage).
