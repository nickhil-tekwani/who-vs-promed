Australia warns of citrus disease outbreak in Papua New Guinea
--------------------------------------------------
Australian scientists have detected an outbreak of Yellow Dragon
(YD), a serious citrus disease in Papua New Guinea (PNG).
Agriculture Minister Warren Truss said scientists from the Australian
Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) found the disease near
the PNG and Indonesian border. Local officials and authorities from
the South Pacific Commission are still determining the extent of the
outbreak.
"There are no controls once infected, and there is no citrus
production on some Indonesian islands because of yellow dragon,"
Mr Truss said. "If established in Australia, YD could affect the
domestic availability of citrus, as well as threatening our citrus export
industry worth more than $188 million [Australian dollars] in 2000-
01," he said. YD, or citrus greening disease, is caused by a
bacterium that attacks the vascular tissue of citrus plants.

[YD (a.k.a. citrus greening disease and huanglongbin) causes
severe damage to citrus production areas in Southeast Asia. The
disease is caused by an unculturable Gram-negative, phloem-
limited, bacteria-like organism (BLO), 2 species of which,
provisionally named _Liberobacter asiaticum_and _L. africanum_,
cause the disease in Asia and Africa, respectively. A similar
disease, cucurbit yellow vine disease (CYVD) in canteloupe,
squash, watermelon, and pumpkin, has been recently reported in
the US.
AQIS scientists detected YD in Indonesian Papua in 1999 and in
East Timor in 2000, and it is moving toward Australia, which is free
of the disease. The pathogen is transmitted by the Asian citrus
psyllid (_Diaphorina citri_) [insect] and its range includes Pakistan
and India throughout southeast Asia to China, Indonesia, the
Philippines, and parts of the western hemisphere, including Brazil,
Florida, and Honduras. YD has not been reported on citrus outside
of Asia. A second psyllid, the African citrus psyllid (_Trioza
erytreae_) occurs in Africa and Saudi Arabia. Both psyllids,
whether containing the YD pathogen or not, cause extensive
desiccation of citrus by direct feeding on citrus plants.
Disease management may involve eradication of diseased trees,
use of antibiotics to reduce the pathogen in infected citrus, and
insecticides to reduce psyllid populations. Infected budwood can be
cured by hot moist air, hot water, or heat therapy. Host-specific
parasitoids (_Diaphorencyrtus aligarhensis_ and _Tamarixia
radiata_), which are parasitic wasps known to be associated with
_D. citri_ in the Asia Pacific region, are being assessed to
determine their efficacy in managing the disease [by killing the
psyllids]. - Mod.DH]
