Meningitis Kills 3500 in Africa
-------------------------------
A meningitis outbreak sweeping across Africa has killed at least 3500
people, the International Red Cross said Wednesday. It said 38 000 cases of
the membrane infection had been documented, but that "many more are likely
to have gone unreported," said the International Federation of Red Cross
and Red Crescent Societies. A statement said it was the worst outbreak of
the disease in the last decade and has caused a serious shortage of vaccine
worldwide. "There is definitely a crisis," said Dr. Hakan Sandbladh, the
federation's emergency health coordinator.
The federation and international health organizations are trying to provide
supplies to the most affected areas, Sandbladh said. The federation
provided a million doses of vaccine to Ethiopia last month and is sending
400 000 more to Burkina Faso, one of the centers of the outbreak in West
Africa, the statement said. Burkina Faso has reported 1525 deaths since the
beginning of the year, the statement said.
Unless vaccination is widespread, bacteria [and the disease are likely to
continue spreading until seasonal rains arrive in several months, Sandbladh
said. Meningitis, an infection of the membranes that protect the brain and
spinal cord, often surfaces in Africa during annual dry seasons.

Meningococcal disease in the African Meningitis Belt - Update 7
---------------------------------------------------------------
See previous reports: 9 Apr; 5 Apr; 27 Mar; 19 Mar; 8 Mar; 28 Feb; 20 Feb 2001.
Burkina Faso: WHO has reported a total of 10 897 cases, including 1525
deaths, between 1 Jan-15 Apr 2001. With funding from the European
Commission through its Humanitarian Aid Office (ECHO), Medecins sans
Frontieres (MSF Belgium) and Pharmaciens sans Frontieres are providing
support to the response in some districts. The ICG has released a further
900 000 doses of vaccine to WHO to continue the mass vaccination campaigns
in the most affected areas.
Benin: WHO has reported a total of 7532 and 300 deaths between 1 Jan-25 Mar
2001 in 4 departments in the country: Borgou, Atacora, Donga and Alibori.
Central African Republic: WHO has reported a total of 1816 cases, including
343 deaths, for the period 18 Feb-30 Mar 2001 for the entire country. The
worst affected prefecture is Ouham Pende, where MSF Spain is carrying out
an exploratory mission.
Chad: WHO has reported a total of 5780 cases, including 607 deaths, from 25
Dec 2000-25 Mar 2001. With funding from the European Commission through its
Humanitarian Aid Office (ECHO), MSF Belgium and Pharmaciens sans Frontieres
are providing support to the response in the prefectures of Moyen Chari,
Mayo Kebbi, Logone Occidental, and Guera.
Ethiopia: WHO has reported a total of 4138 cases, including 242 deaths, up
[as of? 31 Mar 2001 from a widespread area across almost the whole
country. In response to WHO's request to its partners in the Global
Outbreak Alert and Response Network, a senior communicable disease
epidemiologist in the International Health Unit of the Institut National de
Veille Sanitaire, Paris, France will provide continued technical support to
the international response to epidemic meningococcal disease in Ethiopia.
The expert will join the WHO team in the field, working to support the
Ethiopian Ministry of Health in its efforts to control the disease.
Niger: WHO has reported a total of 4014 cases, including 321 deaths,
between 2 Jan 2001 and 8 Apr 2001 in Gay, Boboye, and Doutchi districts in

doses of vaccine to MSF France to assist in the implementation of the
vaccination campaigns in the affected areas.

[While ProMED-mail no longer routinely covers the meningitis activity in
the meningitis belt of Africa, the reported vaccine shortage this year is
of concern, especially given the current situation with reports of 30 039
cases and 2731 deaths as of 27 Apr 2001.
There was a "late breaker" presentation at the Epidemic Intelligence
Service Conference at CDC on Fri 27 Apr 2001 that presented the meningitis
outbreak in Northern Benin. During this presentation, there was mention of
a worldwide vaccine shortage that led to delays in implementation of
vaccination activities until well after identification of the epidemic. The
actual vaccination activities were not begun until well after the epidemic
had peaked (significantly to the right of the epidemic curve, well on the
downward slope). The presentation included the following calculations:
Given 80 percent coverage with 85 percent efficacy of the vaccine, had the
vaccine been available earlier, an estimated 3660 cases could have been
prevented (44 percent of the actual reported cases).
Reasons for the worldwide shortage were not known, but a brief discussion
period revealed that the shortage had affected transmission in other
countries as well, specifically Ethiopia and Burkina Faso. If anyone has
information on the explanation of the vaccine shortage this year,
ProMED-mail would appreciate receiving this information. - Mod.MPP
[It is noteworthy that large numbers of doses of vaccine have been used in
recent years to protect communities around focal outbreaks of meningococcal
meningitis in North America. It is possible that these emergent public
health practices and recommendations are relying on the same sources of
vaccine that have traditionally supplied the needs of the sub-Saharan
meningitis belt of Africa. Perhaps we are seeing a temporary shortage based
upon unpredicted dynamics of the market. - Mod.ES
