ProMED-mail has received the following information from a reliable source:
With respect to the ongoing outbreak of mumps in Israel, there is local
concern that there has been complacency on the part of the Ministry of
Health (see prior ProMED-mail posting: Mumps - Israel (04): Yeshiva
students 20100723.2472). From personal experience, our 6 year old grandson
and his friends are ill with mumps (fortunately mild, uncomplicated cases).
They were vaccinated once, pending 2nd vaccination this coming year -- the
recommendation is for the 2nd dose to be given during the 1st year of
elementary school, using the Jeryl Lynn mumps vaccine. We have heard of
cases occurring following the booster dose, especially in schools.

As of 10 Jul 2010 (the most recent available weekly epidemiologic report),
the total number of reported confirmed cases this year [2010] is 4185
(compared with 6 confirmed cases during the same period in 2009).
Genotyping of the virus involved revealed strain G5 in Jerusalem, and later
on in Bnei-Brak a single nucleotide difference was detected. There has been
discussion that this nucleotide difference has had an impact on vaccine
efficacy in the country.

[The following information is the last paragraph in a newswire on the West
Nile virus outbreak in Israel. - Mod.MPP]
The Ministry has also noted a rise in the incidence of mumps in recent
months, with 4190 cases since the beginning of the year [January 2010]. A
ministry advisory committee has recommended a program of mumps
vaccinations, particularly in areas where the outbreaks have occurred,
notably in ultra-Orthodox communities.

[Subsequent to these reports further enquiries have elicited the following
information.
1. With respect to the ongoing outbreak of mumps in Israel, it seems that
the disease has become more widely spread, apparently affecting additional
sectors of the population [see prior ProMED-mail posting: Mumps - Israel
(04): Yeshiva students 20100723.2472]. As of 10 Jul 2010 (the most recent
available weekly epidemiologic report), the total number of reported
confirmed cases this year (2010) is 4185 (compared with 6 confirmed cases
during the same period last year - 2009). There is spread of disease in
kindergartens and elementary schools in central/coastal Israel, in addition
to Jerusalem. This includes children who have been MMR vaccinated, as well
as some of those duly boosted (with the Jeryl Lynn mumps vaccine) at the
age of 6-8. Genotyping of the prevailing G5 virus strain, reportedly
revealed a single nucleotide difference, initially in Jerusalem and later
on in Bnei-Brak. The possibility that this nucleotide difference has had
any impact on vaccine efficacy in the country has been a matter for
(inconclusive) discussion.

2. The following response to the 2 items above has been kindly received
from the Israeli Ministry of Health and is gratefully acknowledged: In
January 2010 the ministry of Health noted a rise in the incidence of mumps.
A ministry advisory committee has recommended a program of mumps
vaccinations, particularly in areas where the outbreaks have occurred,
notably in ultra-Orthodox communities. In recent months incidence has
decreased, but the outbreak is still ongoing after it peaked on April 2009,
with a total of 4190 cases since the beginning of the year. It should be
noted that the spread of the disease to the general population is limited:
case incidence is highest in the ultra orthodox community. - Mods.AS/CP
