Ten people have died out of 350 new cases of cholera in southern Zimbabwe
since the beginning of August 2002, the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) said on
Wed, 11 Sep 2002.
In the districts of Zaka and Bikita, 61 new cases of the waterborne disease
- associated with poor sanitation - have been reported since the beginning
of September. Last year, 650 cases were reported throughout the country
and 14 people died.
"The current situation is being made worse because of the drought, and in
the rural areas sanitation is very poor," UNICEF Resident Representative
Festo Kavishe said. The situation had been compounded by a protracted health
workers' strike, and an overall shortage of health personnel, Kavishe
explained.
An unexpected setback was also the initial reluctance of a religious sect
in the area to take anti-cholera medication, opting for healing
prayersinstead, he said.
To control the spread of the disease, UNICEF, the Zimbabwe Red Cross
Society, local health authorities, and even the police, have mobilised for
an education and prevention campaign.

Following a WHO mission to Malawi, the reporting of cholera cases has been

(case-fatality rate, 5.13%) were reported in the Nkhotakota area since the
beginning of the year. From 5 May to 26 Aug, 339 cases and 25
deaths (case-fatality rate, 7.37%) were reported in the same area.

As of 1 Sep 2002, WHO has received reports of 661 cases of cholera in
Montserado County. The Ministry of Health and Social Welfare met with WHO,
UNICEF, Médecins sans Frontières (MSF Belgium ) and other nongovernmental
organizations to discuss measures to contain the outbreak. As a result, a
team from the Ministry of Health and WHO assessed the epidemiological
situation in the county, including the camps for internally displaced
persons (IDPs).
The team recommended chlorinating of water in and around Monrovia as well
as in the IDP camps. Community-based health promotion activities in the
affected areas were also recommended.

As of early Sep 2002, the Ministry of Health, Democratic Republic of Congo
has reported 2 636 cases of cholera and 67 deaths (case-fatality rate,
2.5%) in Katanga province, since the outbreak began in Jul 2002. The most
affected areas in Katanga province are: Malemba Nkulu, Kabala, Butombe,
Songwe, and Twite-Mwanza.
A team from the Ministry of Health and Médecins sans Frontières (MSF) has
gone to the affected province to coordinate the response.
"We are very worried by the speed at which the epidemic is spreading, "Luc
Nicolas, a coordinator for MSF in Brussels, was quoted in the statement as
saying. "Over the past 2 weeks, the number of cases in Kinkondja has risen
from 81 to 627 and it would appear that the epidemic has not peaked yet,"
the statement warned.
Many people were dying because local care centers were poorly equipped and
unable to cope with the sudden increase in the number of victims, it said.
"In Kinkondja, out of a total of 627 patients up to now, we have counted
157 deaths," the statement said.
MSF also reported a cholera epidemic in northeastern DRC. In the area
around Lubutu, in Maniema Province, 97 cases were detected last week, 27 of
them fatal. But the true cholera infection rate in the region was believed
to be much higher, MSF said. It said the disease's epicenter in the
northeast was thought to be in Walikale, in north Kivu Province, a highly
unstable region rife with rebel activity.
