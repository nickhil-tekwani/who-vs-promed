An 18 year old horse was euthanized earlier this month [March 2022] after being diagnosed with equine herpes virus, type-1 (EHV-1). Seven days after the Friesian mare developed hind limb weakness the diagnosis was confirmed, according to the Equine Disease Communication Center (EDCC).

Highly contagious, EHV-1 most often causes mild-to-moderate respiratory illness (rhinopneumonitis), but the infection occasionally leads to the life-threatening neurologic disease equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy (EHM). The mechanisms through which EHV-1 produces neurologic disease are not yet understood.

Two other horses on the King County property subsequently developed fevers and have been tested for EHV-1. Results are still pending. Meanwhile, 25 other horses at the boarding barn are considered potentially exposed and the entire facility is under official quarantine.

Meadowbrook Stables, an established barn in Montgomery County, MD, reported that the farm has had more than 40 horses become ill with "mild to moderate" neurologic EHV-1 signs. Discovered on [9 Mar 2022], the first affected equine was a lesson pony named River which had to be euthanized on [10 Mar 2022].

The farm's owners are working closely with their veterinarian, have implemented biosecurity measures, and are quarantining and monitoring the 49 horses remaining on the farm. Three additional horses were sent to the clinic, but have since returned to the farm for treatment. The barn has been closed since [10 Mar 2022].

The Maryland Department of Agriculture (MDA) reports 7 confirmed positive cases on the farm, but notes additional cases may be confirmed. MDA policy states farms are only required to report the first EHV-1/EHM case on a property.

The state of Minnesota has confirmed a case of neurologic equine herpesvirus at a boarding facility in Olmsted County. There is an official quarantine at the facility where 25 other horses were exposed. Neurologic herpesvirus is also known as equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy (EHM).

The 20 year old warmblood mare had onset of clinical signs on [21 Mar 2022] including hind limb ataxia, flaccid tail and urinary bladder atony. She was confirmed positive for equine herpesvirus (EHV-1) on [25 Mar 2022]. The vaccinated mare was euthanized. Officials enacted a quarantine for 25 more horses potentially exposed.

On [25 Mar 2022] the Minnesota Board of Animal Health released the following notification: In accordance with the Board's Equine Herpesvirus Myeloencephalopathy (EHM) Control Plan, "Following the declaration of quarantine of an EHM positive horse, the Board shall in a timely manner post on its web site the name and location of the facility where the EHM positive horse is identified and any other locations where the EHM positive horse was kept in the 72 hours prior to the onset of neurological symptoms." [this information is posted on their website. - Mod.TG]

EHV 101
-------
According to the Minnesota Board of Animal Health, Equine herpesvirus (EHV) is a contagious virus causing 4 clinical presentations including: neurological disease, respiratory disease, neonatal death and abortion. Equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy (EHM) is the neurologic disease developing as a result of EHV infection. The virus has been associated with neurologic cases in llamas and alpacas, but has no effect on people or other types of livestock.

The virus is usually spread in nasal secretions between horses that are in close contact with each other or that share water or feed pails. The virus does not typically survive very long in the environment or on people or equipment. It is killed readily by most disinfectants, ultraviolet light and by drying. Infected horses are generally treated with supportive care. Anti-inflammatory drugs and antiviral medications are often used for those that develop the neurologic form of the disease.

EHM positive horses and EHM exposed horses must be quarantined as outlined in the Board of Animal Health EHM control plan. Board staff members will then work with herd veterinarians and horse owners to carry out the testing and observation protocols defined in the control plan before the quarantines can be released.

On [30 Mar 2022] Indiana State Board of Animal Health (BOAH) confirmed the DeKalb County horse they identified on [22 Mar 2022] as a suspected case of equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1) has tested positive for wild-type EHV-1 on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing. This information comes on the heels of a 20 year old quarter horse mare at the same facility displaying moderate neurologic signs and testing positive for EHV-1 on [21 Mar 2022].

Of the 39 exposed equids on the premises on [21 Mar 2022], 9 more have exhibited neurologic signs and are suspect cases. The facility remains under official quarantine and horses there are being monitored with twice-daily temperature checks.

On [29 Mar 2022] California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) officials confirmed a 32 year old warmblood mare in San Diego County with equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy (EHM, the neurologic form of equine herpesvirus-1, or EHV-1).

The mare began experiencing clinical signs, which included recumbency (down and unable to rise) and hind-end ataxia (incoordination), on [21 Mar 2022] and was euthanized that day due to the severity of her signs.

CDFA placed the premises, with 1 suspected positive and 102 exposed horses, under official quarantine on [30 Mar 2022] and will continue to monitor the outbreak.

EHV 101
-------
Herpesvirus is highly contagious among horses and can cause a variety of ailments in equids, including rhinopneumonitis (a respiratory disease usually found in young horses), abortion in broodmares, and equine herpes myeloencephalopathy.

In many horses, the first or only sign of EHV-1 infection is fever, which can go undetected. In addition to fever, other common signs of EHV-1 infection in young horses include cough, decreased appetite, depression, and a nasal discharge. Pregnant mares typically show no signs of infection before they abort, and abortions usually occur late in gestation (around eight months) but can be earlier. Abortions can occur anywhere from 2 weeks to several months following infection with EHV-1.

Horses with EHM usually have a fever at the onset of the disease and might show signs of a respiratory infection. A few days later, neurologic signs such as ataxia (incoordination), weakness or paralysis of the fore- and hind limbs, urine retention and dribbling, loss of tail tone, and recumbency (inability to rise) develop.

Herpesvirus is easily spread by nose-to-nose or close contact with an infectious horse; sharing contaminated equipment including bits, buckets, and towels; or clothing, hands, or equipment of people who have recently had contact with an infectious horse. Routine biosecurity measures, including hygiene and basic cleaning and disinfection practices, should be in place at all times to help prevent disease spread.

Current EHV-1 vaccines might reduce viral shedding but are not protective against the neurologic form of the disease. Implementing routine biosecurity practices is the best way to minimize viral spread, and the best method of disease control is disease prevention.

[The vaccine for EHV-1 does tend to decrease the severity of the neurological signs, but thus far there is no vaccine that prevents the neurological form of the disease.

Horse owners are encouraged to vaccinate their animals against EHV and use other core vaccines, such as those for eastern and western equine encephalitis (EEE, WEE), West Nile virus (WNV), tetanus, and rabies. Most of these are annual vaccines, except EEE, which needs revaccination approximately every 3-4 months in areas where the disease is prevalent.
