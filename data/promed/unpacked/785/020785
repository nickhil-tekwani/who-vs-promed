The head of epidemiology of the Beni departmental [state equivalent] Health Services, Wilfredo Camargo, said yesterday [26 Jun 2012] that in the 10 days when the [Bolivian] hemorrhagic fever contingency plan has been implemented, 198 _Calomys callosus_, the rodent [the large vesper mouse] that transmits Machupo virus that causes the disease, have been captured.

"We have distributed 100 people for the tasks of rodent control, trapping, capture, and elimination of rodents and their characterization in order to know which zones are most "red" [at risk of infection]," Camargo said to ABI [Bolivian Information Agency].

In the Huacaraje locality, 78 _Calomys callosus_ were captured; in Magdalena 56; in San Ramon 64. For now, there are no data for San Joaquin.

"The epidemiological situation has changed over the past 10 days. So far this year [2012], we have 12 confirmed cases, of which 7 have died. As we continue our work, we are going to see a decrease in the number of ill people," stated the head of Epidemiology of Health Services.

Camargo returned a few hours ago from the provinces of Mamore and Itenez, where personnel, supplies, and equipment had been sent to fight the rodents. He said that training for disease prevention was carried out for health personnel, school teachers, and community members in the San Ramon, San Joaquin, Magdalena, and Huacaraje municipalities.

On 7 Jun [2012], Beni [department] health authorities declared a red alert in the department due to the incidence of hemorrhagic fever. Currently, the number of suspected cases borders on 100 and the confirmed cases are 12, with 7 deaths.

[Bolivian] hemorrhagic fever, also known [locally] as tifus negro [black typhus], is present in the north of Bolivia. The disease is caused by Machupo virus that occurs in the rodent _Mastomy callosus_. The infected animals shed virus through their excretions. Symptoms of the disease are malaise, headache, fever, muscle and joint pain, as well as nose bleeds.

[On 17 Jun 2012, there were 9 confirmed cases of Bolivian hemorrhagic fever, and now, 10 days later, the report above indicates that there are 12 confirmed cases. Perhaps the 4 cases that were under investigation earlier plus another, are now confirmed. The rodent control efforts are clearly underway and one hopes that they will be successful in reducing the number of cases. It is not clear how extensive the public education efforts are, so that all citizens become aware of the measures they should take to control rodents in their own houses and buildings and to avoid exposure to Machupo virus.
