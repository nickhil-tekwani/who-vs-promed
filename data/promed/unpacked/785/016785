Since early 2008, cases of calves dying with the symptoms of
so-called "blood sweating" disease are being notified to the animal
health investigation institutes. The cause of the disease is still unclear.

The disease occurs in different regions of Germany. In Bavaria, the
Animal Health Service (TGD) has been informed of this disease in some
40 calves. The clinic for ruminants at the University of Munich also
reported such cases. Mainly calves aged 2 to 3 weeks are affected, a
report by Agrarheute.com states.

After an usually normal parturition and development during the 1st
weeks of life, sudden bleeding from different points on the body
without any apparent injuries or damage to the skin is reported by
concerned farmers. The bleeding can occur spontaneously, without
apparent skin lesions and from body orifices. In connection with
treatments such as injections or tagging (inserting ear tags),
uncontrollable bleeding from the wounds is reported. Particularly
striking is the progressive pallor of the muzzle and the mucous
membranes. Death usually occurs between a few hours to days after
observation of the 1st symptoms, according to the TGD.

The pathological anatomic examination so far revealed in all affected
calves massive bleeding of the subcutaneous tissue and the body
cavities, the intestines and other organs. In all cases, severe
damage of the bone marrow was diagnosed. Therefore, the observed
bleeding can be explained as a result of a blood clotting disorder
through the lack of replenishment of blood platelets from the damaged
bone marrow. Still unexplained are the cause or the circumstances
that led to the observed bone marrow damage.

The following key points are extracted from information available (in
German, see links below):

In all cases, clinical symptoms and results of post mortem
examination are fairly similar.

From the age of 2 weeks, otherwise healthy calves show either
spontaneous cutaneous bleeding or calves being diagnosed with common,
unrelated diseases show prolonged bleeding from the site of injection
after treatment. These calves later show cutaneous bleeding. Fresh
blood drips from intact skin, often from different parts of the body
and builds crusts on the hide. Hemorrhages of varying severity can be
detected on examination of visible mucous membranes, the muzzle or
nose. Often, the skin of the lower jaw is bloodshot. During the
"bleeding phase," blood is shed with feces to a varying degree. In
the course of disease, calves show raised body temperature and fever,
often reaching 41 C, that doesn't respond to treatment. In most
cases, severe secondary infections like diarrhea or pneumonia or
complications from infected hematoma are observed.

In all cases investigated, a massive decrease of platelets and
leucocytes is found in the early stages. Severe anemia follows during
the course of disease.

- calves of various breeds/crosses are affected
- 1st signs between 2-4 weeks of age
- different regions of Germany have experienced cases
- virology BVDV and bluetongue negative
- serology BVDV and bluetongue positive when the dam had been vaccinated
- post mortem shows bone marrow of a jelly like consistency
- no or only few megacaryocytes

The cause of the condition is still under investigation.

[The apparently significant temperature elevation in affected animals
may be indicative of an infectious agent. On the other hand, the
decreased blood clotting as described may be more related to
metabolic/nutritional problems. The hemorrhagic aspect of the
syndrome can go both directions. More information on the dimensions
of the problem is also required.

Any contributory observations addressing the described syndrome from
practitioners, veterinary researchers, nutritionists, epidemiologists
or breeders, with special reference to veterinary schools and
clinics, will be appreciated. - Mod.AS]
