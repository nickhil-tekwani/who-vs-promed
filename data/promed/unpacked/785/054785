Epidemiological comments: Highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N8 virus belonging to the 2.3.4.4 B clade has been detected in one common buzzard (_Buteo buteo_). The bird was found in Province of Lecce on 17 Nov 2020 and moved to a wildlife rescue center located in Museo Calimera (Province of Lecce), where it died. Thus, the bird carcass was submitted for necropsy examination on 8 Jan 2021 at the Regional Reference Laboratory and organs were collected for avian influenza detection (M gene), resulting positive. These samples were sent to the National Reference Laboratory for diagnostic confirmation and pathotyping on 22 Jan 2021.

Control measures
Measures applied: Movement control inside the country; screening; control of wildlife reservoirs; vaccination prohibited; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: No other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type: Experimental Zooprophylactic Institute of the Venezie - Padova (national laboratory)
Species / Test / Test date / Result
Eurasian buzzard (common buzzard) / Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) / 25 Jan 2021 / Positive

[The last outbreak assessment report no. 13 for the cases of HPAI in the UK and Europe, published on 26 Jan 2021 by DEFRA-APHA, mentions: "Looking at the overall trends in Europe, there was a small increase in the number of wild bird cases in the first 3 weeks of January [2021] following the decrease in rate of new cases in November/December [2020], although this is considerably smaller than the increase in wild bird cases report in early 2017 (so far). To 25 Jan 2021, this year there have been 93 wild bird cases of 844 in total since October [2020], of which 38 were reported to OIE on 22 Jan. At this stage in the 2016/17 epizootic, there had been 625 wild bird cases, with cases rising to over 1000 by mid-February 2017 in the 2nd peak. For poultry, overall, the number of outbreaks reported are reducing (particularly in Germany and Poland). The exception is France, which has reported a large increase in numbers as H5N8 spreads though the duck industry in the southwest. In southeast Europe, HPAI has not obviously spread, with a few wild bird cases on the Black Sea in Romania and the Czech Republic and no further reports in Hungary." The full report is available at <tinyurl.com/3hroaud4>.

The fact that HPAI subtype H5N8 and other subtypes HPAI H5N5, H5N4, N5N3 and H5N1 currently circulating in the European continent have been detected in wild birds is indicative that these viruses are being distributed wherever these wild birds migrate. Poultry producers, small and large alike, must therefore implement all the biosecurity measures necessary to protect their flocks from exposure and infection. - Mod.CRD
