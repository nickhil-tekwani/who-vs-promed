A tropical flesh-eating disease, Buruli ulcer, is spreading across
West Africa and has infected at least 40 000 people, leaving them
with bloody infected wounds and swollen skin ulcers, which at their
worst, require surgery or amputation, according to the World Health
Organization (WHO).

The disease has been reported in 30 countries around the world,
mostly in poor, rural, tropical communities that live near water. In
West Africa, according to WHO 2006 statistics, Ivory Coast has
reported 24 000 cases, Ghana reported 11 000, and Benin has 7000
confirmed cases [these are the number of cases recorded in Cote
d'Ivoire between 1978 and 2006, in Benin between 1989 and 2006 and in
Ghana since 1993, according to the WHO -- see
<http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs199/en/> and below].
Despite a 10-year global WHO-backed Buruli ulcer research initiative,
researchers still do not know how the disease is spread, and whether
water-born insects are to blame, as suggested by early research.

Even though the same bacteria family causes both Buruli ulcers and
tuberculosis, Buruli ulcer disease receives far less international
attention and remains one of the world's most overlooked diseases,
according to the WHO.

A woman, who gives her name as Agnes, says it has been 5 years since
she was diagnosed with Buruli ulcer disease. She lives in Agbanou, a
rural town 60 km [37.3 miles] from Benin's economic hub, Cotonou. She
told the IRIN before her infection, she spent most her time working
in marshlands. "At the beginning, I felt pain everywhere, and then
the skin on my feet hurt even more and started to change colours.
Then I saw open wounds. I thought it was witchcraft, which is why I
did not think to go to the hospital. Instead, I turned to a
traditional healer," said Agnes. When her condition worsened, and the
healer could not treat her deepening wounds, Agnes says she went to
the hospital where doctors told her she had Buruli ulcer disease.

Roch Christian Johnson, director of Benin's Program to Control Buruli
ulcer disease, says unreported cases in Benin outnumber reported ones
because lack of knowledge about the disease, illiteracy, poverty and
traditional healing often prevent people from going to medical
facilities. Also, the disease has few noticeable symptoms at the
beginning -- painless swelling, no fever -- according to the WHO.
Yet, without treatment, massive, bloody ulcers start tearing away the
patient's flesh.

Johnson says when it reaches this stage it can cost up to USD 2000 to
cure the disease. Depending on how bad the ulcers are, the patient
may need 8 weeks of medicine, surgery, or in a worst-case scenario,
amputation to fight the infection. Hospital stays often last longer
than 3 months; complications can lead to even costlier long-term
disability, according to the WHO.

Patient care is subsidised in part by the government and private
foundations in Benin. But nevertheless, Johnson says the cost is
still too much for many ulcer patients. The average annual salary in
Benin is USD 570, based on 2008 World Bank figures.

Faced with a rapidly spreading and largely unknown disease, and
mounting health care costs, Benin's government set up 5 testing
centres throughout the country starting in 1998 to try and catch the
disease early. On average, about 80 people seek treatment or testing
in these centres for Buruli ulcer every month, according to program
director Johnson.

From 2003 to 2006, Johnson says health officials tested and treated
3793 people. Out of the country's 12 regions, 8, including the south
with its 125 km [77.6 miles] of open coastline, have reported
infections. The arid north has been spared.

Despite the fact that little is known about how the infection is
spread, Johnson says he is still hopeful the disease can be
controlled. "The prospects are good to progressively contain this
disease in Benin. We are working with a large team of [local]
researchers to learn all we can about this disease, which means, in
the near future, the situation will improve." Johnson says even if
health officials do not know how the disease is spread, they can
encourage people to get tested at government health centres, and to
get treatment quickly to prevent the disease from consuming their
flesh -- and finances.

The WHO reports a vaccine, available in Benin, can offer some
short-term protection against _Mycobacterium ulcerans_, the bacterium
that causes the ulcers.

[Most of the following information has been extracted from
<http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs199/en/>:

Buruli ulcer is an infection caused by _Mycobacterium ulcerans_,
which leads to extensive destruction of skin and soft tissue with the
formation of large ulcers on the limbs, predominantly the legs. The
disease progresses without pain or fever. When previously neglected
lesions heal, scarring may cause restricted movement of limbs and
other permanent disabilities. Almost all patients are children under 15 years.

Although slow growing, _M. ulcerans_ can be cultured from human
lesions on media used for mycobacteria, provided the incubation
temperature is kept between 29-33 DEG C [84.2-91.4 DEG F]. _M.
ulcerans_ DNA can by amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
from swabs of ulcers or tissue biopsies with sensitivity is around 98 percent.

Buruli ulcer has been reported in more than 30 countries mainly with
tropical and subtropical climates, and is endemic in many foci in
sub-Saharan tropical Africa, as well as in south-east Asia and in
Australia, near Melbourne, where it is referred to as the Bairnsdale
ulcer. The incidence of the disease has increased markedly for
unknown reasons in the last decade in several West African countries,
notably Benin, Cote d'Ivoire, and Ghana, as the above report documents.

_M. ulcerans_ is an environmental mycobacterium and has been
recovered from water and soil in swampy areas. Cases seem to occur in
association with an aquatic environment. Near Melbourne, Australia,
an outbreak of Buruli ulcer occurred in both golfers and non-golfing
local residents and visitors in small area, in the center of which
was a golf course where sewage was treated and the effluent used to
irrigate the course (see ProMED post: Buruli ulcer - Australia 19951211.1230).

Natural reservoirs and the exact mode of transmission of _M.
ulcerans_ are still unknown, though abrasions after contact with
contaminated water, soil, or vegetation have been thought to be
likely routes of entry. Also, insects have been thought to be
possible vectors (see ProMED: Mycobacterium ulcerans - Australia
(VIC): mosquito-borne, susp 20050311.0713). There is no evidence
that the disease can be transmitted from person to person.

Current recommendations for treatment are as follows:
1. A combination of rifampin and streptomycin/amikacin for 8 weeks
as a 1st-line treatment for all forms of the active disease. Nodules
or uncomplicated cases can be treated without hospitalization.
2. Surgery to remove necrotic tissue, cover skin defects and correct
deformities.
3. Interventions to minimize or prevent disabilities.
