Pet owners are being warned of a distemper outbreak found in a number of Burnet area raccoons.

According to the Burnet Police Department, about 15 raccoons in the West Jackson and Hamilton Creek River Walk area have tested positive for the distemper virus, which affects dogs and cats but not humans.

The virus is contagious to other carnivores, and there is no treatment for it once contracted. Pets can be vaccinated against the virus, however.

Animals with distemper can be mistaken to have rabies. Signs of distemper in raccoons include those of an upper respiratory infection that becomes pneumonia. Advanced stages of distemper include neurological signs.

Officials recommend people call Burnet Animal Control at (830) 798-3971 or the Burnet Police Department at (512) 756-6404 if they notice an animal acting strangely.

[Canine distemper virus is the pathogen most frequently causing outbreaks at the carnivore wildlife-domestic interface. As distemper and rabies affect the central nervous system, they both cause behavior disorders. In raccoons, distemper usually results in neurological signs such as stumbling and lack of 'shyness', they can seem 'dumb' and/or 'friendly'. Rabid raccoons also might lose their fear to humans and other animals and they may become slower and are brought into stupor, but they present profuse salivation, indiscriminate biting, and odd vocalization. It is very important to make sure to keep the vaccination schemes of all dogs in the area up to date, including both rabies and distemper.
