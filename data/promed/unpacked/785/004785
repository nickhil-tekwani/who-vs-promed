The district veterinary officer for Kumi, Dr Michael Okwalinga, wants a thorough investigation of the vaccine supplied by government to vaccinate cattle on Tisai Island, Ongino sub-county in the district 2 months ago [April 2017].

This comes after the vaccinated animals tested positive for the deadly foot and mouth disease virus.

Dr Okwalinga said his visit to the island a week ago [week of 11-17 Jun 2017], confirmed that the vaccinated animals were the ones which had contracted the virus.

[The meaning of "tested positive" deserves clarification. Have the animals shown clinical FMD signs? What test has been applied?

Accurate information on the dates of vaccination and of the appearance of 1st signs of disease in the vaccinated animals, is essential. In case 2 months elapsed between the vaccination and the appearance of disease, it would be unlikely to attribute infection to vaccination. In case a virus has been isolated from the affected cattle, its serotype, as well as the composition of the vaccine, are also needed for the investigation wanted by the district veterinary officer.

Applying the expression "The deadly FMD virus" is somewhat far-reaching. FMD viruses may be lethal in very young animals (sheep, goats, cattle). In adults, mortality will, generally, not exceed 2-5 percent, though the virus may seriously affect the animals' production records. - Mod.AS
