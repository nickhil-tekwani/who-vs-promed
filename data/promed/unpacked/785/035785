Swine Fever Strikes Masaka
---------------------------
The Masaka district authorities have imposed a quarantine on the
movement of pigs after an outbreak of swine fever in several parts of
the district where several animals have been reported dead .
The District Veterinary Officer (DVO), Dr. Lawrence Mayega said at
least 5 sub-counties have been affected by the fever. These include
Kabonera, Kyamuliibwa, Kingo, Kisekka, and Malongo.
"As a result of the widespread swine fever, we have imposed a
quarantine on the movement of pigs all over the district as one way
of stopping further spread, because we do not have treatment," he
said.
He said swine fever has no drug treatment but farmers can stop it if
they kept their animals in one place. He said that people are free to
eat pork as long as it will not be transported from one village to
another. The quarantine became effective immediately.

[According to the OIE's data, Classical Swine Fever has not been
reported previously in Uganda. The provisions of the International
Animal Health Code require, in case of a first recording of an OIE
List A disease, an emergency reporting by the relevant country.
However, most probably the "swine fever" referred to in this posting
is African Swine fever -- which is endemic in Uganda.- Mod.AS]
