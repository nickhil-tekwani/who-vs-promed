A recent disease outbreak affecting giant barrel sponges (_Xestospongia muta_) is being documented by local scuba divers. The outbreak believed to be sponge orange band (SOB) disease has been observed within the last 2 weeks [2nd half of April 2012] on reefs ranging from Boynton Beach, 12 miles north to the Town of Palm Beach.

According to published research (http://people.uncw.edu/pawlikj/2011FEMSAngermeier.pdf), it has been difficult to pinpoint the exact causes of SOB; however, environmental stress is likely to decrease the fitness of sponges, which may, in turn, render them more susceptible to disease. As of now, the cause of SOB disease in barrel sponges remains unidentified.

Disease epidemics can cause drastic reductions of sponge populations, with negative effects on the overall reef ecology. Sponge diseases have been documented in all major ocean bodies, with the Caribbean representing a particular hot spot. They typically start with the appearance of discolored patches, followed by tissue disintegration, leaving behind the exposed skeleton. SOB disease usually results in sponge death.

Local divers are asked to email their observations, photos and locations of barrel sponge disease outbreaks to Palm Beach County Reef Rescue (http://www.reef-rescue.org).

[The etiology of SOB disease is still unknown. Attempts to gather evidence that incriminate a single microbial agent have failed. The disease is, however, strongly associated with high or low temperatures. The hypothesis that coral reef diseases are basically opportunistic infections secondary to physiological stress (e.g. increasing water temperature) appears to be the most supported one.
