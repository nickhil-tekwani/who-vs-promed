Health Officials Issue Cholera Alert, October 15, 1997,
John Mwaura, PANA Correspondent

NAIROBI, Kenya (PANA) - Medical personnel in Kenya's Nyanza Province have
received a red alert following a cholera outbreak which threatens to become
a rampaging disaster. The high alert was issued on Tuesday at the launch
of a massive campaign by the ministry of health to contain the outbreak in
all the districts in this western Kenyan province.
So far, more than 130 people have died from the contagious disease since
the current outbreak was first reported in the area three months ago. Ten
people were reported Tuesday to have died in the last three days, bringing
to 40 those reported dead from the disease in the past week alone. Dozens
more are receiving treatment in hospitals.
In the lake Victoria port town of Kisumu, the headquarters of the province,
344 km west of Nairobi, 30 food houses and two major markets were ordered
closed down by health authorities.
The Kisumu deputy public health officer, C.C. Suhudu, confirmed the closure
of the two markets, adding that the death toll in the town had risen to 16.
The provincial medical officer, Dr. Richard Muga, said 2,500 people have
been hospitalised to date, while 25,000 have been given drugs in the
province since the outbreak of the epidemic.
The director of medical services, Dr. James Mwanzia, toured the disease
stricken areas Tuesday and announced that a team from the French agency,
Medicines Sans Frontiers, would camp in the town until the situation was
brought under control. He warned that the epidemic had reached a critical
stage, and advised local communities to observe high hygenic standards.
Meanwhile, attention is being focused on neighbouring Rift Valley districts
following a suspected cholera outbreak in Molo township in Nakuru district,
187 km west of Nairobi. Medical personnel in Nairobi told PANA that the
large volume of travellers and commuters in the two provinces is a critical
factor in potential nation-wide spread of the disease. Nakuru, Molo, and
Kisumu are on the major Mombasa-Nairobi-Busia-Kampala highway.

Kenya who can give any details on the epidemic (epidemic curve, etiologic
agent, attack rates, case fatality rates, geographic distribution) and
comment about control measures. -Mod. pc
