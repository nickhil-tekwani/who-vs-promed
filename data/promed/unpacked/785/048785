Yummy Market is recalling "Yummy Market brand Smoked Lake Trout w/Pepper with Cracked Black Pepper" for possible _Clostridium botulinum_ contamination. It was sold from Yummy Market at 1390 Major Mackenize Drive West in Maple, Ontario. The recall was triggered by a consumer complaint.

There has been one illness reported that may be associated with the consumption of this product. If you purchased it, do not eat it. Throw it away in a sealed package, or take it back to the place of purchase for a refund. Wash your hands well with soap and water after handling this product. You can see a picture of the recalled product at the CFIA [Canadian Food Inspection Agency] website (https://goo.gl/viNMjZ).

Food contaminated with this toxin will not change the look, taste, smell, or texture of food. The bacterium that produces the toxin grows in anaerobic environments.

The symptoms of botulism food poisoning include facial paralysis, loss of facial expression, unreactive fixed pupils, difficulty swallowing, drooping eyelids, blurred or double vision, difficulty speaking, slurred speech, and a change in the sound of voice. The paralysis gradually descends through the body, resulting in difficulty breathing.

[Given the vehicle, botulism type E is the likely culprit here.

The following was extracted from ProMED-mail Botulism, smoked fish - Finland ex Canada 20060721.2000:

_Clostridium botulinum_ type E is naturally highly prevalent in aquatic environments and fish, leading to a high risk of contamination. The hot-smoking processes are usually too low to eliminate botulinum spores. Growth and toxin production from spores in vacuum-packed smoked fish products with anaerobic atmosphere and limited preservative factors is likely during extended storage at temperatures above 3 deg C (37.4 deg F). Therefore the most important factors controlling _C. botulinum_ growth and toxin production are efficient heat treatments, restricted shelf life, and continuous storage below 3 deg C (37.4 deg F). - Mod.LL
