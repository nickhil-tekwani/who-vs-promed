A diarrhea outbreak has hit Chinhoyi [Mashonaland West Province] with about 1000 cases recorded in the last 3 weeks, amid fears that the bug could result in fatalities.

The outbreak, which is being blamed on the rotavirus, started about 3 weeks ago. About 309 cases were recorded last week [week of 26 May 2014], with 202 of them being children under the age of 5. The seriously affected have been admitted at Chinhoyi Provincial Hospital, while others are being given oral rehydration solution.

Makonde district medical officer Dr Paradzai Mudzengerere confirmed the outbreak and said a comprehensive awareness campaign was underway. "We have seen an increase in the number of diarrheal cases in recent weeks and we attribute that to the onset of the winter season where the rotavirus is very active," he said.

Government has come up with an immunization programme to deal with the rotavirus which thrives in low temperatures. The program was carried out about 2 months ago and more than 60 percent coverage was recorded in Chinhoyi.

About a dozen of them are undergoing treatment at the Sagarmatha Zonal Hospital, while others in the village itself under the supervision of doctors, Senior Public Health Officer Bijaya Kumar Jha said.

So far, no one has died of the disease in the village. A team of doctors with necessary medicines has been providing treatment, he added.

[3] Diarrhea, displaced persons - Myanmar (Kachin State)

Refugee camps in Mantwynegyi village in Mansi Township of Kachin State are suffering from an outbreak of dysentery due to over-crowding and lack of adequate hygiene. At present, there are 5 refugee camps in Mantwynegyi village and more than 6000 refugees are sheltering there, according to Zaw Latt, in charge of KPC refugee camp.

"There are about 50 patients receiving medical treatment in our relief camp every day. Among them, most of the patients are suffering from malaria and diarrhea. I think, the number of patients may have increased in June 2014. Infectious diseases are mainly due to unhygienic food and cleanliness," said nurse Nan Yaw from KPC's refugee camp.

A new refugee camp had to be extended in Mantwynegyi village to accommodate over 2000 new arrivals due to the recent fighting between the army and Kachin insurgents in April 2014. Many of the refugees worried about the education of their school-age children, let alone hygiene, food, and basic accommodation problems that come with the arrival of the monsoons.

"There are many difficulties. We face accommodation problems due to a narrow room. There are many patients increasing in the camp," said a 50-year-old woman living in KPC refugee camp.

"We worry about the education loss of our children because they are flying to our camp due to recent clashes occurred in April [2014]. There are about 200 school-aged children here," said a resident from the refugee camp.

"Currently, we don't restrict travelling in the region. But we told to the locals who are going to farm on the mountain to be careful along the main road. Last month [May 2014], most of the fighting took place in Kyar Gaun Mountain," said Lt-Col Kyaw San Oo, Battalion Commander of Light Infantry Division 83.

[4] Diarrhea, rotavirus - Solomon Islands (national)

The Solomon Islands Ministry of Health and Medical Services has declared a nationwide diarrhea outbreak. The Ministry of Health and Medical Services (MHMS) also responded to people by saying that "hand washing saves lives". The outbreak of diarrhea has affected over 1000 people and resulted in at least 16 deaths in young children in the past 2 weeks. These outbreaks have been reported in 6 provinces, including Guadalcanal, Western Province, Choiseul, Malaita, Central, and Makira.

"Diarrhea is a leading cause of death in children under 5 years old", said Dr Chris Becha, MHMS Under Secretary, Planning and Policy. "To keep their children safe, parents need to take their child to a health clinic as soon as they show signs of diarrhea."

"Parents should request that their children be given oral rehydration salts (ORS) and zinc to reduce the duration and severity of the illness, and ensure children take these medications as instructed," said Dr Becha.

Rotavirus has been confirmed as the cause of the outbreaks in [Honiara in Guadalcanal province, and Gizo in Western Province].
