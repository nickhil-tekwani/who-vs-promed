A new case of [a] hantavirus [infection] is reported in Los Santos Province. Health authorities confirmed that a patient from Tonosi was admitted to the area hospital center without the need to move him to another [facility]. The patient is receiving treatment to stabilize his condition.

The Ministry of Health reports that to date there have been 15 cases of hantavirus [infections] in Los Santos province so far in 2015.

What is hantavirus [pulmonary syndrome]? It is an acute infectious disease transmitted by rodents to humans, caused by Hantaan virus [incorrect. Hantaan virus is found in Asia, not in the Americas. Choclo virus occurs in Panama. See further comments below. - Mod.TY]

What are the symptoms? Early symptoms are similar to influenza: fever of 38 C [100.4 F], muscle pain, chills, headache, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhea. Between 1-12 days the patient [may] present with respiratory insufficiency with arterial hypotension and cardiac failure, with risk of death if not attended to promptly.

[The hantavirus responsible for this and previous cases is not mentioned or, in the above report, misidentified as Hantaan virus. The means of acquisition of the infection is also not described above. Los Santos province is endemic for Choclo hantavirus. As noted in the comment for the previously posted Los Santos cases (ProMED-mail archive no. 20150204.3140834), Choclo virus is the only 1 of the 3 hantaviruses known to be in Panama that causes hantavirus pulmonary syndrome. There were 75 cases of presumed Choclo virus infection during 2014, and case numbers have begun to mount again this year (2015). Elimination of trash and food sources that attract and harbor the rodent reservoir, as well as careful cleanup practices to avoid production of aerosolized virus-contaminated materials, such as rodent excreta, will help to prevent exposure and infection. The rodent host of Choclo virus is the pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys fulvescens_), a photograph of which can be accessed at http://www.medwave.cl/medios/perspectivas/Hantavirus/Actualiz/Fig2.jpg. These rodents are found in and around agricultural areas and adjacent houses and buildings.

MacGowan, Andrew J. Simpson, Javeed Ahmed, Timothy J. Brooks, Roger Hewson. A non-fatal case of hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome imported into the UK (ex Panama), July 2014.

We describe a rare case of hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS) diagnosed in a United Kingdom resident who returned from Panama in July 2014; this represents only the 3rd published case of HCPS imported in Europe to date. Serological analysis identified increasing titres of hantavirus IgG antibodies over the course of illness and detection of hantavirus RNA in serum taken 7 days after onset of symptoms. Sequence analysis following a pan-hantavirus diagnostic assay confirmed the presence of Choclo hantavirus, a species of hantavirus known to circulate in Panama and suspected of causing several cases of severe human disease in the Los Santos region of Panama during 2014. A set of molecular assays was designed to characterize the S segment of the genome and to provide rapid molecular identification for future cases.

Discussion
The diagnostics used to confirm this case show the robustness of the initial molecular and serological assays to detect a rare strain of hantavirus. In addition, the specific molecular assays developed to determine the causative agent for this case report confirmed that CHOV RNA was present in the patient sera. These diagnostics represent the 1st published real-time RT-PCR and sequencing strategies for the diagnosis of this severe human pathogen and may prove useful for rapid species specific diagnostics in endemic areas and for diagnosing cases in returning travellers worldwide.

[ProMED thanks Barry Atkinson for calling this article to our attention. It is reassuring to have the virus involved in this case convincingly identified as Choclo virus. That leaves this virus as still the only 1 in Panama as the etiological agent responsible for hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in that country. Mod.TY]
