Brussels to control the foot and mouth fight
--------------------------------------------
Brussels would take charge of future foot and mouth epidemics under a new
European directive. The European Commission has concluded that no single
member state can be trusted to tackle epidemic diseases threatening the
whole union. The EC would have power to order vaccination.
Countries worried by an outbreak in another EU state could trigger
mandatory vaccination, meaning that Ireland or France could effectively
override Britain's slaughter policy. The intervention by Brussels ends the
reliance on mass slaughter that saw 6 million animals burned in Britain
last year. The cull turned much of the countryside into a no-go area, led
to a public outcry across Europe, and was denounced as "immoral" by the
Dutch farm minister.
The draft law moves the European Union towards a policy of emergency
vaccination. The commission will be able to order vaccination if infected
livestock are not culled within 24 hours and contiguous animals within 48
hours. In Britain it took as long as 7 days to carry out culls in the early
phase, before the Army was brought in.
The directive is to be published in early October 2002. The draft version
obtained by The Telegraph says: "The decision to introduce vaccination
shall be taken by the commission on request of the member states directly
affected, or on request of the member states under risk, or on the
commission's own initiative."
Brussels is to stockpile a million doses of the vaccine for immediate use
and a further 4 million to be ready within 10 days.
The commission will police member states to ensure that their contingency
plans are up to scratch. Specific requirements are set down for the number
of vets and surveillance personnel and biannual field drills along the
lines of recent exercises in Australia.
The new directive is a response to a year-long inquiry by the European
Parliament, which has highlighted major shortcomings in British policy.
The shift away from the slaughter policy has been made easier by new
international rules agreed in May, which make it less costly for countries
to resort to ring vaccination. These rules limit the loss of foot and mouth
free status from 12 to 6 months and confine the affected area to regions
rather than whole states.

[Until 1990, a policy of annual mass vaccinations in bovines, using a
trivalent FMD vaccine, was applied in several continental EU member
countries, such as the Netherlands, France, Germany, and Italy. The new
directive is a significant revision of the EU "non-vaccination" policy
applied since 1991. - Mod.AS]
