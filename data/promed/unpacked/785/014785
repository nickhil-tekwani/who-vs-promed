New castle disease outbreaks and vaccine failure: Pakistan
----------------------------------------------------------
During the last 3 to 5 months most of the poultry farmers in Pakistan and in Afghanistan saw acute outbreaks of Newcastle disease in commercial poultry and domestic birds.
The prevailing scenario indicates 2 major factors:
1. Vaccination failure due to one or another reason, or
2. Change in genetics of field viruses of Newcastle disease.

The latter one is in need of laboratory and molecular investigation but the 1st one is very clear. Currently, [9] well known companies are dealing in biologics/poultry vaccines in Pakistan, all showing very poor immunological response in the field. The 'La Sota' regular or clone strain [of all 9 foreign manufacturers] and some locally manufactured biologics are all intensively used and are of very poor performance. These vaccine brands are repeatedly administered to birds according to the recommendations of poultry veterinarians [in time of disease outbreaks] and by the farmers according to the manufacturers recommendations [without veterinarian consulted] for the preventive immunization of healthy birds.

More than 99 percent of vaccines used in Afghanistan are supplied from Pakistan. The scenario of vaccine failure is the same in both countries. The poultry industry is at risk if the virus exist in the same pathogenic form giving no response to available vaccines strains.

The most important factors for vaccine failure are related to the following:
- poor standard of vaccines supply chains by vaccine suppliers;
- non-authenticated manufacturing sources;
- incompatibility between the field virus and the viruses incorporated in the imported vaccines;
- deficient storage conditions of vaccines by the suppliers, retailers and the farmers;
- the methods of vaccine administration.

Another alarming situation is created by the use of antiviral drugs in poultry; i.e., amantadine. This antiviral drug is of very dangerous nature used by local drug manufacturers. The antiviral activity of the chemical [in humans] is known but its effectiveness in poultry is questionable because of its mode of administration and its concentration. Amantadine use in poultry may affect the virus resistance and enhance genetic drift in the virus' genetic make-up; this may create a very alarming situation for poultry producers as well as biologics manufacturers.

[Dr Khalid Khan is acknowledged for the above provided information.

Additional information, particularly from laboratory-backed sources, on the Newcastle disease situation and vaccine efficacy in Pakistan will be appreciated. Similarly, on the reported use of amantadine in poultry. To the best of our knowledge, according to international livestock regulations, the antiviral preparation amantadine is licensed only for human use; however (unauthorised) prophylactic use of amantadine in poultry production has been reported in news articles in Asia. - Mod.AS
