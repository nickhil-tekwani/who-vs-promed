NDSU's [North Dakota State University] Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory has confirmed the 1st case of anthrax in the state this year [2012]. A beef cow in Stark County was diagnosed with the disease. Livestock producers are advised to protect their animals from the disease. State Veterinarian Dr. Susan Keller says that a vaccine is available through licensed veterinarians.

"Producers should contact their veterinarians to determine when and if their animals should be vaccinated and that their boosters are up to date," she said. "They should also monitor their herds for unexpected deaths and report them to their veterinarians."

Keller said dry pastures and short grass in some parts of the state are ideal conditions for livestock to ingest anthrax spores and develop the disease.

Anthrax information is available on the North Dakota Department of Agriculture website at http://www.nd.gov/ndda/disease/anthrax.

[This is very late in the anthrax season for such a northern state to be afflicted. Charlie Stoltenow, the states' senior veterinary extension officer, runs a very active and efficient programme each year to persuade his ranchers to vaccinate their cattle; see 20120630.1186029. A constant aspect of their few outbreaks, when they do occur, is that the affected stock had not been vaccinated. Thus, these outbreaks act as a cautionary tale to others to not disregard Charlie's advice. Fortunately, it is now probably too late for any more ND outbreaks; further south in Texas, for example, we do see October cases of anthrax. - Mod.MHJ
