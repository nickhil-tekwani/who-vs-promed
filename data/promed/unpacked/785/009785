Ottawa public health officials reported on Wed 1 Sep 2004 the city's first
probable human case of West Nile virus infection. A 47-year-old man
recently tested positive for the illness and is recovering at home. The man
is believed to have been exposed to the mosquito-borne virus while
travelling outside the Ottawa area.
"Residents must remain vigilant and take personal protective measures to
reduce the risk of being bitten by mosquitoes, even with the onset of
fall," associate medical officer of health Dr. Dave Salisbury said in a
statement.
Health officials plan to install 4 traps in the neighbourhood where the man
lived. Larvicide has also been applied in roadside catch basins, as well as
in selected ditches and open bodies of water.
To date, 6 crows in Ottawa have tested positive for the West Nile virus.
Probable human cases have also been reported in Toronto and Windsor. A
woman from York Region, just north of Toronto, died on 22 Aug 2004 from
West Nile virus while vacationing in Florida.
