Indonesia: Avian influenza situation - WHO Update 3
---------------------------------------------------
As of Mon 15 Jan 2007, the Ministry of Health of Indonesia has
confirmed the death of a 22-year-old woman from Tangerang City,
Banten Province. The woman, whose infection was announced on 12 Jan
2007, died later that day.
The Ministry of Health has also confirmed 2 additional cases of human
infection of H5N1 avian influenza.
A 22-year-old woman from South Jakarta developed symptoms on 6 Jan
2007 and died on 12 Jan 2007. Investigations into the source of her
exposure found reports of bird deaths near her home in the days prior
to symptom onset.
The 18-year-old son of the 37-year-old woman from Tangerang City,
Banten Province has now also been confirmed as infected with H5N1
avian influenza. He remains in hospital in a critical condition.
Investigations into the source of his infection indicate similar
environmental exposure as his mother.
Of the 79 cases confirmed to date in Indonesia, 61 have been fatal.

One of 2 hospitals designated to treat bird flu cases in the
Indonesian capital has been overwhelmed with patients with symptoms
of the disease, a doctor said on Mon 15 Jan 2007. In response to a
new surge in cases, 2 Indonesian ministers said the government was
pressing for a ban on backyard fowl in 3 provincial areas worst hit
by the H5N1 bird flu virus.
Four Indonesians have died so far in 2007 after a 6-week lull in
cases, taking the number of human deaths from bird flu in the country
to 61, the highest of any country. Nine people with bird flu
symptoms, including a 5-year-old girl in intensive care, were being
treated at Jakarta's Persahabatan hospital and its isolation rooms
could accept no more patients, the head of the hospital's bird flu
ward said. "If we get more patients, we will send them to Sulianti
Saroso," Muchtar Ichsan told Reuters, referring the country's main
bird flu treatment centre in North Jakarta.
Seven of the patients at Persahabatan came from Bekasi, a town east
of Jakarta, said Muhammad Nadirin, a doctor at the bird flu
information centre. An 18-year-old man being treated in Persahabatan
has been confirmed to have bird flu after his mother died of the
disease on Thu 11 Jan 2007. The man's father, from Serpong in west
Java, was also being treated for similar symptoms but 2 tests found
he did not have the H5N1 virus. More tests would be conducted.
Nyoman Kandun, director-general of communicable disease control at
the health ministry, said on Saturday the positive test of the son
signalled a cluster case but there was no evidence of human-to-human
transmission of the virus so far. The largest known cluster of human
bird flu cases worldwide occurred in May 2006 in the Karo district of
North Sumatra province, where as many as 7 people in an extended
family died. The cluster triggered fears the virus had mutated into a
form that could spread easily between people.
Aburizal Bakrie, coordinating minister for welfare, said the
government had recommended provincial governments in West Java,
Banten and Jakarta ban backyard fowl in housing areas to reduce the
risk of bird flu spreading to humans. Millions of backyard chickens
live in close proximity to humans and health education campaigns have
often been patchy and rules difficult to enforce with the country's
power structure increasingly devolved to the provinces. "We are
taking the step because the current condition has reached emergency
health levels," Bakrie told a news conference, adding owners of
backyard fowl would receive compensation of 12 500 rupiah (US$1.40;
$1 = 9110 rupiah) per bird once the ban was in place.
Although Health Minister Siti Fadilah Supari said the ban would come
into force in a couple of days and be extended to 14 other high-risk
provinces, local governments have the final say and previous attempts
to prevent people from keeping fowl have met with stiff resistance.
Bird flu is endemic in around half of Indonesia's 33 provinces and
the vast, developing country has struggled to contain the disease.
Indonesian officials have, however, said they have made progress in
their efforts to fight bird flu.

In Indonesia, avian influenza virus is reported to have killed 61
people since mid 2005, including at least 3 so far in 2007. Test
results showed at least 10 patients hospitalized for suspected H5N1
were negative for the virus, said Muhammad Nadirin, an official at
the Indonesian Health Ministry's avian flu information center. The
patients were being treated in hospitals in the western part of Java
island, Lampung, North Sulawesi and South Sumatra provinces, he said
in a telephone interview today.
An 18-year-old man whose 37-year-old mother died on 11 Jan 2007 of
H5N1, remains in hospital in a critical condition, the WHO said in a
statement on its Web site yesterday [see above]. "Investigations into
the source of his infection indicate similar environmental exposure
as his mother," the United Nations health agency said. The family
members lived in Tangerang city in Banten Province. Almost all human
H5N1 cases have been linked to close contact with sick or dead birds,
such as children playing with them or adults butchering them or
plucking feathers.
There is little evidence linking human cases with contact with wild
birds, said Denis Hoffmann, a technical adviser on avian flu with the
UN's Food and Agriculture Organization in Bangkok. "With good
protection, there is not much concern about virus infection in wild
birds" spreading to humans, Hoffmann said in a telephone interview
today. "A lot more blame has been put on migrating birds, but they
are not necessary the cause" of H5N1 outbreaks in domestic fowl, he
said. "There is a lot of evidence some bird flu is spread by the
movement of poultry products and eggs."
Thailand's Agricultural Ministry yesterday said 2100 poultry were
culled to contain an outbreak in Phitsanulok province, about 377
kilometers (234 miles) north of Bangkok. Outbreaks in the Southeast
Asian nation last year killed 3 people in July and August 2006.
Infections in birds and people are increasing, particularly in Asia,
where the virus was first identified a decade ago. Viet Nam, Hong
Kong, South Korea, Japan and Nigeria reported diseased birds in the
past month, while Indonesia, China and Egypt found new human cases.
Human and poultry H5N1 infections have tended to increase during the
Northern Hemisphere winter months, WHO said yesterday.
Japan's Agriculture Minister Toshikatsu Matsuoka will visit a farm
today on the southern island of Kyushu, where 3900 chickens died of
H5N1 virus infection in the past week and more than 8000 fowl were
culled to contain the disease's spread. "So far, all parties involved
are doing their best and the issue is handled effectively," he told
reporters in Tokyo today. The ministry plans to announce today the
preliminary report of an investigation of the outbreak, which
occurred on a farm in Miyazaki prefecture. [There have been no human
