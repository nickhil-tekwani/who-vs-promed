Take-all has had a major impact on both winter wheat and barley yields in 2022 in county Cork. The dry weather in the weeks leading up to harvest served to exacerbate the problem, resulting in lower yields. The disease has impacted wheat and barley crops equally.

[Take-all of wheat and barley is caused by the fungus _Gaeumannomyces tritici_ (previously _G. graminis_ var. _tritici_). It can cause severe yield losses of up to 50% and grain quality is reduced. The pathogen was first recognised in Australia in 1852. Take-all is considered the most serious root disease of cereals worldwide but appears to be restricted to temperate areas.

Disease symptoms may include rotting of roots and lower stems; stunting of plants; whitened seed heads; shrivelled grains; reduced tillering and sterile spikes. Infection can occur throughout the crop cycle. Disease development is favoured by cool soil temperatures, alkaline or nutrient deficient soils, nitrate, as well as minimum tilling practices. Disease severity is expressed as take-all index (TAI), which is calculated as the proportion of nodal root systems with symptoms.

The pathogen is soil-borne and persists on crop debris in the soil. Volunteer cereal plants and grasses may serve as pathogen reservoirs. Disease management relies primarily on cultural practices (such as crop rotation with non-hosts, moderate planting density, control of reservoir hosts, field drainage), as well as phytosanitation to minimise carry-over of inoculum to subsequent crops. Fungicides are being used as seed treatments, but are not very effective against soil-borne fungi. No varieties of wheat or barley exist at present with specific resistance to take-all. Further research is being carried out (ProMED post 20210330.8277006 & see link below); _Triticum monococcum_, one of the ancestors of modern cultivated wheats (_T. aestivum_, _T. turgidum_) has been shown as a potential source of take-all resistance genes.

Some decline in disease severity ("take-all decline") has been reported after a few years of successive wheat or barley crops. This is thought to be due to the development of environmental microorganisms antagonistic to the fungus, but does not return yields to the level of uninfected crops.

The related _G. avenae_ affects oats; _G. maydis_ affects maize; _G. graminis_ affects rice (ProMED-mail post 20150910.3635557) and a range of grasses.
