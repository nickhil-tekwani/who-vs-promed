The 1998/2000 Outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo
---------------------------------------------------
By coincidence, we are just about to submit a manuscript detailing the
1998-2000 outbreak of Marburg hemorrhagic fever (MHF) in Durba, Democratic
Republic of the Congo (DRC). In light of the current events in Angola,
some of these data may be of interest here. A total of 154 cases were
identified, with a case fatality of 83 percent. The mean age was 28 years
(range: 7 days to 72 years). Only 12 (8 percent) of the cases were under
age 5, and the case fatality for this group was the same. Most cases were
in young males exposed in nearby gold mines. Secondary transmission in the
household appeared to be limited. There was evidence of transmission of
Marburg virus in the region prior to 1998, but that did not result in a
high prevalence of antibody in the population (1).
Although precise calculations are close to impossible, age-stratified
attack rates appear to vary significantly between filovirus outbreaks. The
relatively low incidence of pediatric cases of Ebola-Zaire during the 1995
outbreak in Kikwit, DRC, prompted theories of natural immunity in children.
These theories were scrapped after the 2000 Ebola-Sudan outbreak in Gulu,
Uganda, where fatal infection in children was common.
MHF fever is too rare to have enough data on potential links between a
particular genotype and virulence, especially any age-stratified data.
Previous infection and immunity could result in what is being seen in
Angola, and ProMED-mail has listed previous outbreaks of hemorrhagic
illness in Angola that could have been MHF. However, I have my doubts that
transmission would have been so widespread (and non-fatal) to result in
appreciable population immunity of older age groups.
I suspect that the age distribution of cases in Angola will ultimately turn
out to have more of a behavioral basis, as opposed to biological. The most
common point source when a cluster of VHF is seen is the hospital. It is
not clear from the ProMED-mail listings how many of the children might have
been seen and potentially exposed at the same health facility. An outbreak
of Lassa fever in Sierra Leone in 2004 in which pediatric cases
predominated was ultimately thought to be linked to contaminated multi-dose
vials (2). If the hospital can reasonably be excluded, less obvious sources
need to be considered. Do children enter for play or work (even very young
children often help with family chores in sub-Saharan Africa) into caves
where bats, a leading reservoir candidate, roost? Do children find and eat
fruit that could be contaminated by bat guano? Sequence data, no doubt
forthcoming, should shed light on whether this appears to more of a point
source outbreak or multiple introductions, facilitating the generation of
hypotheses to be investigated.

Angola: A Comment on Marburg Virus Transmission
-----------------------------------------------
There has been speculation about the role of bats as a possible reservoir
for Ebola and Marburg viruses (1). I understand that Marburg virus has
some phylogenetic similarity to _Paramyxoviridae_.
There was a previous ProMED-mail report about Nipah virus ( a member of
_Paramyxoviridae_) transmission to humans attributed to eating fruit
contaminated by bat excreta (2). Another such report suggested that
certain fruit drops from trees at night after being partially eaten by a
bat, and then children collect and eat the unwashed contaminated fruit.
This was suggested as an explanation for fatal cases of Nipah virus
infection in one outbreak occurring in persons not more than 15 years of age.
Since the reported cases of Marburg hemorrhagic fever in Angola are
predominantly in children, I wonder if there is a fruit that tends to be
given to local children in this age group and if this fruit is
contaminated? This age group is also more likely to place objects in the
mouth that are contaminated with excreta from peridomestic rodents. This
could provide an alternate explanation of oral ingestion of virus. Parts of
northern Angola experienced flooding this year, which might suggest a
season of heavy rains and subsequent irruptions in the bat or small mammal
population (4). I understand that at least part of Uige province in Angola
is forested.

[Professor Bausch's analysis of data from the 1998-2000 outbreak of Marburg
hemorrhagic fever in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) will provide an
interesting background for comparison with the situation in the current
outbreak in Angola, particularly with regard to the limited extent of
secondary transmission and low prevalence of specific antibody observed in
the DRC. We appreciate Dr Bausch's cooperation in making these data
available for posting on ProMED-mail.
Both Mike Thomas and Daniel Bausch have raised the question of the role of
bats as potential reservoirs and vectors of Marburg hemorrhagic fever virus
and suggest that exposure to virus-contaminated fruit might explain
the apparent greater vulnerability of young children to infection. This is
an intriguing suggestion, and it would be interesting to know the relative
abidance of frugivorous bats in the region. It is tempting to make the
comparison with transmission of Nipah virus in East Asia; however, it
should be stressed that the phylogenetic link between the _Filoviridae_ and
the _Paramyxovviridae_ is weak and does not imply any similarity in
biological properties. - Mod.CP]
