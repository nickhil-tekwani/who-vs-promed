The Fraser Valley [British Columbia] avian flu outbreak has hit its 1st non-commercial site, infecting a small 85-bird operation. The new case is a small Aldergrove coop raising ducks, chickens, geese and turkeys, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency has confirmed.

It's also the 1st infected site in Aldergrove since the virus struck 2 farms in Chilliwack and Abbotsford in early December [2014]. The virus has since spread to 12 sites, infecting nearly 250 000 birds.

Health officials say infection risk to humans is extremely low if poultry products are prepared properly.

[Although the article is short and not specific, it is very likely this is the HPAI H5N2 that has been affecting the areas of the Fraser Valley. This virus shows no mercy in the victim it claims, paying no attention to the small or the large producers.
