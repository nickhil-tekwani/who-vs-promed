[1] Massachusetts (Hampden County) infant fatality

http://commonhealth.wbur.org/2012/04/death-from-pertussis


A happy, healthy 6-week-old baby - got his 1st cold shortly after the new year. His mother had seen her share of sniffles (she has 2 older daughters, 8 and 5) and didn't think much of it. "It was just a little cough and sneeze," she said. "I wasn't too worried."

But a few days later, on 6 Jan 2012, his fever spiked to 104 degrees. So, in the middle of the night, the parents decided to take the baby to the emergency department at Baystate Children's Hospital in Springfield, Mass. near their home in Chicopee. He tested negative for flu and a common respiratory virus. By early morning, his fever was gone and the family was sent home. 3 weeks later he would be dead, a victim of pertussis, or whooping cough, a preventable but highly contagious bacterial disease that has been on the rise in recent decades.

At home, his breathing became slightly more labored; he'd been diagnosed with bronchiolitis, a swelling and buildup of mucus in the tiny air passages of the lungs, usually due to a viral infection. After another examination later in the week, a pediatrician prescribed albuterol to ease his symptoms.

On 16 Jan 2012, the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday, the infant started spitting up more and his breathing worsened. This time he was admitted to Baystate's pediatric ICU, his mother said. A medical team assessed him; and an infectious disease doctor suggested he might have pertussis, though the diagnosis remained uncertain. Indeed, the family didn't get confirmation of his pertussis until after his death, when a test for the disease came back positive. "I could have bet my whole life that it wasn't pertussis," the mother said, recalling her reaction when the illness was 1st mentioned. "He wasn't coughing like I would have imagined. And I didn't know any infant who ever had pertussis."

But pertussis, or whooping cough, or "the cough of 100 days" for its generally long duration, has been on the rise since the 1980s, according to the CDC. The disease is characterized by violent, uncontrollable coughing (including the characteristic "whoop" sound) that can make it hard to breathe. But sometimes there is no "whoop." And infants with pertussis don't always cough, but may have apnea, a long pause in their breathing. The disease is most common in young children; babies under one are particularly vulnerable and face the greatest risk of death.

In 2010, there were 27 550 reported cases of pertussis nationally, the CDC says. That year, in California, 9143 cases of pertussis, including 10 infant deaths, were reported, the greatest number of cases in 63 years, according to the CDC. Vermont had a pertussis outbreak in 2011. And on 3 Apr 2012, Washington State officials declared a pertussis "epidemic," with over 1000 cases reported.

The CDC recommends pertussis vaccines for infants, adolescents and adults (most recently, pregnant women), summarized here:

Infants and children are recommended a dose of DTaP (Diphtheria, Tetanus, and Acellular Pertussis) vaccine at 2, 4 and 6 months, 15 through 18 months, and 4 through 6 years of age. Everyone 11 years and older, including pregnant women, is recommended one dose of Tdap (combined Tetanus, Diphtheria and Acellular Pertussis) vaccine, preferably at 11-12 years of age. Pregnant women are recommended to receive a dose of Tdap vaccine, preferably during the 3rd trimester or late 2nd trimester (after 20 weeks gestation). By getting Tdap vaccine during pregnancy, maternal pertussis antibodies transfer to the newborn, likely providing protection against pertussis in early life, before the baby starts getting DTaP vaccines. Tdap will also protect the mother at time of delivery, making her less likely to transmit pertussis to her infant. A CDC spokesperson adds: "Everyone needs Tdap vaccine as an adolescent/adult even if they were fully vaccinated with DTaP or DTP vaccine as a child."

What, exactly, is driving the increase in pertussis cases isn't totally clear. Experts speak of a convergence of factors, including waning immunity after vaccination, low vaccine compliance among adults (who had coverage rates of only 8.2 percent in 2010, according to the CDC) and a general perception that whooping cough isn't a dire condition. Another factor may be that pertussis is going undiagnosed in many cases - since not everyone "whoops" - allowing for disease to spread. In addition (though the CDC disputes this) declining use of antibiotics by doctors wary of overuse and drug resistance may also be a cause. Some put the blame on parents who refuse to vaccinate their children. But officials at the CDC say it's more likely that declining protection in vaccinated people rather than vaccine refusal is contributing to the increase.

[2] Idaho (Bannock County) infant fatality
Date: Thu 3 May 2012

http://www.localnews8.com/news/31002886/detail.html


An infant from Pocatello died Thursday, from a once almost defeated disease now seeing a resurgence, pertussis. At 9 weeks old, this infant was too young to get a vaccine, but health professionals said if more people in the community made sure children got immunized, the baby likely wouldn't have caught this disease. The distinct wheezing noise a child infected with pertussis makes when gasping for breath in between fits of coughing, gave the disease its nickname, whooping cough.

"Pertussis is a very contagious disease. It's a very debilitating, life-threatening disease also for little ones who can't fight it off," Portneuf Medical Center Infection Preventionist Joyce Olson said. Olson said it is especially tragic when a child dies of a disease that has vaccines against it. "It's very sad when any child that young, or any age, dies of pertussis, because it is a preventable one. It is a very sad situation," Olson said.

Southeastern Idaho Public Health [SIPH] said if 90 percent of kids were vaccinated, the disease would be almost nonexistent. But many parents choose not to immunize their kids, some citing fears of a believed connection to autism. Those at SIPH said there's no significant danger from getting vaccinated. "Vaccines are very, very safe. They are monitored so closely for any kind of adverse reaction, and the benefits of the vaccine, far, far, far and away outweigh any minimal risks," SIPH District Director Maggie Mann said. It is a parents choice whether to immunize their kids, but those with SIPH said people should remember that one child not getting vaccinated means all children are more likely to get sick. "While this is totally their call, whether or not to have their child vaccinated, it is critically important in protecting children against a variety of really serious childhood diseases," Mann said.

According to SIPH, in local communities 72 percent of children are immunized.

In information released from Iowa Department of Public Health, as of [19 Apr 2012], 92 confirmed cases of pertussis have been reported in Iowa. This is an 83 percent increase over the 5-year average for the state. While cases are predominately occurring in eastern Iowa, scattered cases are being reported across the state. During outbreaks, local public health agencies interview cases (ensure appropriate isolation and treatment), identify those people who have been in close contact, and recommend prophylactic antibiotics to stop them from becoming ill and to stop further transmission.

Howard County Public Health would like to inform the community that pertussis (whooping cough) is in Howard County. As of 27 Apr 2012, confirmed cases of pertussis have been found in Howard County. Howard County Public Health and local healthcare providers are working with affected individuals and close contacts. Local healthcare providers are aware of the situations. Iowa Department of Public Health does not recommend an entire class is treated for pertussis and/or school be canceled.

The North Fayette School District is confirming an outbreak of whooping cough. The district reports 15 to 20 school age children have come down with the illness within the last week. The district issued a letter to parents which states it is
working closely with Palmer Community Health and the Iowa Department of Health in dealing with the disease.

Students with confirmed cases of whooping cough are being isolated from the school population, by staying home from classes. Administrators say those students are also banned from all school activities until a whooping cough test comes back negative.

Clear Creek Amana Schools are also confirming an outbreak of whooping cough, but are not stating how many students are sick.

An individual from Hauppauge High School has been diagnosed with pertussis, commonly known as whooping cough, according to a message posted on the district's website Monday, [30 Apr 2012]. A letter from Suffolk County Executive Steve Bellone and Suffolk County Department of Health Services does not identify the individual, or say if the individual was a student or faculty. Hauppauge parents were notified of the confirmed pertussis case by phone calls on Monday evening, according to district spokeswoman Trish Auerbach.

2012 year to date (YTD) confirmed and probable cases reported through [28 Apr 2012} (week 17)
----------------------------
This update summarizes reports of pertussis in persons with 2012 onsets received by local health jurisdictions (LHJs) during weeks 1-17, made visible to Washington State Department of Health (DOH) - Communicable Disease Epidemiology, and containing sufficient information for a DOH case classification to have been assigned.

There have been a total of 1132 cases reported statewide through week 17, compared to 117 reported cases in 2011 during the same time period. Dates for the 2011/2012 comparison were based on LHJ notification date. 12 counties have reported no pertussis activity in 2012.

Among the 27 counties with pertussis activity, the number of pertussis cases reported in a given county so far in 2012 ranges from 1 to 234, and the rate of disease in a given county ranges from 1.1 to 196.1 per 100 000 persons year to date (see Table 1 [for tables see original URL - Mod. LL]). The median and mean county rates in counties reporting pertussis activity are 11.7 and 23.1 per 100 000 persons year to date, respectively.

The overall incidence rate year to date is 16.8 pertussis cases per 100 000 Washington residents and the rate of disease in infants under 1 year of age, 88.1 per 100 000, remains higher than rates in all other age groups (see Table 2). This equates to an annualized overall rate of pertussis in Washington residents of 51.4 per 100 000 persons with a rate in infants of 269.5 per 100 000 should this trend continue throughout 2012. 78 infants under 1 year of age were reported as having whooping cough and 20 of them were hospitalized. Of those hospitalized, 16 (80 percent) were very young (3 months of age or younger).

Grant County Health District (GCHD) staff are investigating 2 cases of whooping cough (pertussis) in Grant County residents who spent time at the Ephrata Middle School and High School while contagious 16-27 Apr 2012. No one has been hospitalized.

In an effort to control the spread of disease, the Health Officer is recommending antibiotic treatment for all people who have come into close contact with whooping cough. GCHD recommends that all close contacts that have a cough be tested for pertussis. "This is not a pertussis outbreak. However, we are working with the Ephrata School District to quickly notify students' parents/guardians and staff of their possible exposure to control the spread of this highly contagious disease," states Shawta Sackett, Community Public Health Manager and Epidemiologist.

The Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services (DPHHS) reports that outbreaks of pertussis, also known as whooping cough, are being reported in several areas of Montana and is urging vaccines for all children and adults to help prevent the disease. Since January 2012, nearly 90 cases of pertussis have been reported statewide, compared to approximately 50 cases for the same period in 2011. Recent cases have been reported in Broadwater, Gallatin, Lewis and Clark, Ravalli, and Stillwater counties. Local and state public health officials are concerned that the number of reported cases will continue to increase unless people take action to protect themselves and others.

Washington State has reported a large increase in reported pertussis, with nearly 800 cases reported over the last 4 months. Montana health officials do not want what is occurring in Washington State to happen here.

"Most cases of pertussis are preventable," said DPHHS Director Anna Whiting Sorrell. "All parents and caregivers of children need to make sure their children are up to date on this and other vaccines. Anyone who cares for children should also be up to date on their vaccinations to prevent spreading pertussis."

Public Health Madison & Dane County said in a news release on Wednesday, 25 Apr 2012, that more than 90 cases of whooping cough have been reported since 1 Mar 2012, and more cases are expected. For 2012, more than 160 cases have been reported.

"These numbers are particularly alarming (because) they are much higher than the 2 or 3 cases per month we've seen the past several years," said Amanda Kita-Yarbro, communicable disease epidemiologist for Public Health Madison & Dane County.
Most of the cases are in school-aged children, especially in the 10 to 14 years old age group. The next hardest hit age group is among teens 15 to 19 years old, and the third hardest hit group is 5 to 9 year olds.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said pertussis is an endemic disease, meaning it's pretty common for outbreaks to occur on a regular basis at any time of the year in various parts of the country.

[10] Arizona (Maricopa County), infant fatality

http://www.azcentral.com/news/articles/2012/04/25/20120425phoenix-area-whooping-cough-death-1st-since-2009.html


A Maricopa County infant died of whooping cough in April 2012, the 1st such death since 2009, the county Department of Public Health said. The baby was too young to be immunized and likely contracted the illness from an adult, health officials said. They urged residents to get vaccinated if they are in close contact with children younger than 12 months old.

About 700 cases were reported in 2011, more than double the cases reported in 2009. Jeanene Fowler, county public-health spokeswoman, attributed the increase to more cases of whooping cough, or pertussis, and more testing being done by physicians.

[Research by both Dr Frits R Mooi from the Netherlands (Pertussis - Australia (04): newly emerging clones, discussion 20120322.1078115) and Dr Lyn Gilbert from Australia (Pertussis - Australia (03): newly emerging clones 20120321.1076103) have been previously highlighted in ProMED-mail reflecting antigenic changes in circulating clones of _Bordetella pertussis_ which may be causing the increased number of pertussis cases throughout the world. These changes may result in a need for modifications of the currently used acellular pertussis vaccines.

Current recommendations for 'cocooning' infants against pertussis include dTap vaccinations of the pregnant woman after the 1st trimester as well of the father, aunts and uncles and grandparents. Given the aforementioned concerns regarding the acellular vaccine, it would be important to know if the reservoirs of pertussis at risk to infants are essentially those immunized with the acellular products rather than the original whole cell, killed _B. pertussis_ vaccine. - Mod.LL]
