New human case of avian influenza H5N1 in Cambodia in 2013
----------------------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health (MoH) of the Kingdom of Cambodia wishes to advise members of the public that one more new human case of avian influenza has been confirmed positive for the H5N1 virus. The 6th case is a a 5 year old girl from Angk Krasang village, Prey Lvea commune, Prey Kabass district in Takeo province who was diagnosed with H5N1 influenza on 7 Feb 2013 by Institut Pasteur du Cambodge. She developed symptoms on 25 Jan 2013 with fever, cough, and vomiting. She was initially treated by local private practitioners.

Her condition worsened and she was admitted to Kantha Bopha Hospital on 31 Jan 2013. Unfortunately, despite intensive medical care, she died on Thu 7 Feb 2013. There is evidence of recent deaths among poultry in her village and the girl had a history of coming into contact with poultry prior to becoming sick. The girl is the 27th person in Cambodia to become infected with [avian influenza] H5N1 virus, and the 6th person this year [2013] and the 24th person to die from complications of the disease.

Of all the 27 cases, 18 were children under 14, and 18 of the 27 confirmed cases were females.
