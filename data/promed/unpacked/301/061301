Mystery disease killing 2 a day
-------------------------------
An average of 2 persons are dying each day from the mystery disease
that has hit the Kagua Erave district in Southern Highlands,
according to the son of a medical assistant.
[One individual interviewed], whose father works at the Usa village
aid post, said that this month [July 2004] alone, 25 people from
Apopa village had died. "It is a major epidemic," he told The
National on arrival in Lae yesterday [27 Jul 2004], and warned that
the aid post was running out of medical supplies.
Villagers from surrounding areas have also succumbed to the disease,
which is believed to be malaria. Since April 2004, the disease is
reported to have claimed more than 100 lives. A medical team has been
dispatched to the villages, but the provincial health authorities
have yet to hear from it.
[The individual interviewed] said he spent 3 weeks with his father in
Usa. He said that 2 aid posts in the Sumi and Wabi areas had been
closed due to election-related problems, and sick people had to go to
Usa for treatment. "The sick are coming from the villages of Lakira,
Kandopa, Imane, Marunda, Ralomanda, Rakere, Sugu, Rakuare, Sare in
the Usa, Wabi, and Sumi areas. They have symptoms of malaria, and the
aid post can only give them anti-malaria tablets, which does not seem
to do much good. The villagers are finding it hard to arrange proper
funerals, as the deaths are continuous, with many belonging to the
same family. This is a major disaster that has hit the entire Kagua
Erave area," he said, adding that he had witnessed some of the
deaths. [He] said his father's aid post was ill-equipped to look
after the 20 000 people in the Usa, Wabi and Sumi areas. "This is a
crisis, and I urge the medical team that is investigating the cause
of the mystery disease to quickly find out the cause," he said. He
said the problem was compounded by the fact that the people want to
move around freely.

[In the prior ProMED-mail posting (Undiagnosed deaths - Papua New
Guinea (Southern Highlands): RFI 20040721.1978), the symptom complex
of a severe, fatal illness, associated with fever, headache, nausea,
vomiting, and jaundice, was given in the news wire article. The
earlier article mentioned that, although malaria was suspected, of
the 5 individuals on whom blood testing was performed, all 5 were
negative for malaria. It appears as though the above outbreak is
still being considered as due to malaria, in which case, drug
resistance (treatment failure) would be the explanation for the high
mortality being reported (albeit a true case fatality rate is not
calculable, as the number of non-fatal cases is not given). In the
absence of more definitive information from authoritative sources,
one is hard pressed to conclude that this outbreak is due to drug
resistant malaria, or, to other possible etiologies of illness that
present with fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, and jaundice such as
the hepatitis viruses, leptospirosis, malaria, or old world
hantaviruses. Again, we are requesting more information from
knowledgeable sources. - Mod.MPP]
