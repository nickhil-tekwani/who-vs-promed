At least 3 Chagas disease cases have been reported from the southernmost municipality of Lábrea in Amazonas state, Brazil, according to a <globo.com> report

Amazonas Health Surveillance Foundation (FVS-AM) and the Municipal Secretariat of Health of Labrea (Semsa-Lábrea) are investigating the cases to determine if the disease was contracted through the consumption of contaminated acai.

According to information from Semsa-Lábrea, samples of açaí production were collected and analyzed at the Central Public Health Laboratory (Lacen-FVS) to confirm the presence of the vector in the product.

The 3 patients are all being treated for Chagas on an outpatient basis.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), Chagas disease, also known as American trypanosomiasis, is a potentially life-threatening illness caused by the protozoan parasite, _Trypanosoma cruzi_ (_T. cruzi_). It is found mainly in endemic areas of 21 Latin American countries.

About 7 million to 8 million people worldwide are estimated to be infected with the parasite.

_T. cruzi _parasites are mainly transmitted by the infected feces of blood-sucking triatomine bugs, or kissing bugs. In addition, the parasite can be transmitted via food contaminated with _T. cruzi_ through for example the contact with triatomine bug feces, blood transfusions using blood from infected donors, passage from an infected mother to her newborn during pregnancy or childbirth, organ transplants using organs from infected donors and laboratory accidents.

[The açaí palm is a species of palm tree cultivated for its fruit and hearts of palm (See Wikipedia here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A%C3%A7a%C3%AD_palm).

Oral transmission of Trypanosoma cruzi_, Chagas disease, has increasingly been reported all over endemic areas in South America since the outbreak in St. Catherina, Brazil, in 2005 (see ProMED reports below). The transmission is most probably by crushing infected triatomine bugs when fruits or sugar cane are crushed to produce juice.
