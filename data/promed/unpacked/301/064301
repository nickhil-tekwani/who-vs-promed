A total of 3 H5 HPAI positive cases were reported during September in
smallholders (<100 birds) in Dakahlia, Giza and Menoufia
Governorates.

Asia
----
Bangladesh
----------
A H5N1 HPAI outbreak was reported on a commercial chicken farm in
Manikgonj District, Dhaka Division. A total of 6 birds died and 544

India
-----
Following the discovery of an HPAI outbreak in Dhubri District, Assam
(reported to OIE on 8 Sep 2011), another outbreak occurred on 14 Sep
2011 in Nadia District, West Bengal. It has been reported that the
stamping out of all domestic poultry in an approximately 3-km-radius
zone around the outbreak has been applied with compensation. There was
a susceptible total population of 99 714 birds, of which 17 694 have
died or been destroyed.

Indonesia
---------
July 2011: The Participatory Disease Surveillance and Response (PDSR)
programme through 33 Local Disease Control Centres covers 71 976
villages in 86 percent of Indonesia's 448 districts and municipalities
in 29 of its 33 provinces. During July, PDSR conducted surveillance in
1675 villages (2.3 percent). The overall HPAI incidence was 1.6
infected villages per 1000 villages under surveillance. The highest
HPAI incidence occurred in Sulawesi Selatan Province (17.2 per 1000),
followed by Kepulauan Bangka Belitung (13.0 per 1000) and Sulawesi
Barat (10.9 per 1000). The high incidence rates reflect a major
outbreak which occurred in South Sulawesi and the high level of PDSR
activity in a group of small islands with less than 400 villages in
total, where 5 villages were infected. No village visits were
undertaken in Kalimantan Barat, Kalimantan Selatan, Sulawesi Utara,
Nusa Tenggara Barat and Nusa Tenggara Timur Provinces during this
period.

August 2011: During August, PDSR conducted surveillance in 1340
villages (1.9 percent). The overall HPAI incidence was 0.9 infected
villages per 1000 villages under surveillance. The highest HPAI
incidence occurred in Sulawesi Barat (21.7 per 1000), followed by
Sulawesi Selatan (5.3 per 1000), Kalimantan Timur (3.3 per 1000) and
Kepulauan Bangka Belitung (2.6 per 1000). No village visits were
undertaken in Kalimantan Selatan, Kalimantan Tengah, Gorontalo,
Sulawesi Tenggara, Sulawesi Utara, and Nusa Tenggara Timur Provinces
during this period.

Viet Nam
--------
During September 2011, there were no new outbreaks reported on the
government website. However, it appears that Quang Tri (North Central
Coast Region) and Quang Ngai (South Central Coast Region) [are
infected?].
