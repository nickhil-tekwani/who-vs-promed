[We normally would not provide this level of detail in our OIE reports but
this is a significant outbreak with serious animal health consequences.
Below are some details of laboratories studies and control activities from
the OIE reports and it is becoming quite clear we are dealing with FMD
virus type O in both cases. As demonstrated by the clinical history in the
South Korean outbreak, FMD cycles through a herd extremely rapidly. Under
controlled conditions at Plum Island, USDA's facility for exotic animal
diseases, I have seen FMD exposure in cattle result in vesicular lesions
within 48-72 hours. The virus has also been isolated from the throats of
humans 48 hours after exposure, not to mention spread by fomites and wind.
So there is definite potential for wide geographic distribution from the
infected herds in either Japan or South Korea. It would be very useful to
have an authoritative update on any newly infected herds in either Japan or
South Korean, if and when they occur. We hope the stamping out policy works
but will hold our collective breath. - Mod PC
Japan Outbreak:
All information in OIE report can be found in previous posting: Foot &
mouth disease suspected, cattle - Japan (02) 20000329225748.
South Korean Outbreak:
Report Date - 27 Mar 2000
Date of initial incident: 20 Mar 2000
Location: Papyung county, Paju city, Kyunggi province, about 5 km from the
Demilitarised Zone, in a basin, well isolated by a wall of mountains
Population affected: 1 dairy farm of 12 milking cows and 3 calves. All
cattle were destroyed.
Clinical signs and history: clinical signs observed were: depression,
anorexia, excessive salivation, lameness, vesicles and ulcers on feet,
mouth, tongue and teats, and a sudden drop in milk production. Disease
started with one milking cow on 20 Mar 2000, spread to 10 animals on 22 Mar
2000 and rest of herd on 24 Mar 2000. Owner notified officials on 24 March.
Diagnostic results:
- RT-PCR(1) (3D polymerase, IRES(2) and 1D common regions): positive;
- DNA sequencing (3D polymerase region): partial;
- viral antigen typing by ELISA(3): positive;
- antibody detection using liquid-phase blocking ELISA: positive;
- indirect ELISA using recombinant 3D polymerase: positive;
- transmission electron microscopy: virus particles in vesicular fluid;
- virus isolation: in progress.
Causal agent: FMD virus type O is suspected by ELISA for antibody detection
and viral antigen typing (using diagnostic reagent and kit made by
Pirbright Laboratory, United Kingdom), and by RT-PCR.
Control Measures: stamping out (26 March 2000); setting up of protection
and surveillance zones.
