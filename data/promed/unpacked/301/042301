Another case of Middle East respiratory syndrome has been confirmed in Korea, bringing the total number of cases to 5 since the 1st case was confirmed last week.

Officials say the 5th patient is a doctor who treated the 1st MERS patient last week, becoming the 1st case of medical staff infected with the virus.

The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the doctor is one of the 4 people, including a nurse who also treated the 1st MERS patient, who underwent the virus test Tuesday [26 May 2015] after they came down with fevers.

While the nurse was confirmed to be free of the virus, the other 2 test results will come out this Wednesday [27 May 2015] morning.

Currently, some 60 people are under home confinement in Korea due to the virus.

Most of them are medical staff who had treated previous MERS patients.

The MERS virus, which has a fatality rate of around 40 percent, is relatively new to humans, with only some 1100 cases reported since the 1st case was confirmed in Saudi Arabia in 2012.

There are currently no vaccines or cures available.

[It appears as though respiratory precautions may not have been implemented early enough to prevent spread to individuals near the "index" case in this apparent nosocomial outbreak in the South Korea. This is now the 5th case reported in the past week, all related to a returning businessman who spent time in the Middle East (see section [6] below for his itinerary - Bahrain, UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar all within 14 days of onset of symptoms). As cases have been recently reported from the UAE, Saudi Arabia and Qatar, and the fact that the index case was involved in the farming industry, exposures could have been with infected animals or humans with whom the index case had contact.

[2] South Korea, 4th case - media report
Date: 26 May 2015

http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20150526000914


As Seoul on Monday [25 May 2015] confirmed its 4th MERS case -- the daughter of the 3rd confirmed patient, who asked to be quarantined but was rejected by the authorities -- the Health Ministry is under fire for the poor handling of the potential patients.

Fear of the Middle East respiratory syndrome in Korea further spread on Tuesday [26 May 2015] as 2 medical staff members who had been in contact with the patients showed symptoms of fever. The 2 were transported to a hospital to test for infection, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.

The 4th confirmed patient, in her 40s, spent about 5 hours with her 76-year-old father, who was sharing the hospital room with the 1st 2 confirmed MERS patients earlier this month [May 2015].

When her father became the 3rd confirmed MERS patient on [21 May 2015], she reportedly asked the health authorities to quarantine her, as she was experiencing mild symptoms, including a fever and a headache. The woman was worried that she had MERS and wished to be isolated at a medical facility for fear of transmitting the virus to her husband and daughter.

The authorities, however, sent her home, saying her symptoms were not strong enough to be considered MERS. Yet she eventually showed a high fever 5 days after her father's diagnosis and was confirmed as the 4th MERS patient in the country.

Since her diagnosis, the Health Ministry has been criticized by the public for negligence, since despite widespread fear of the rare disease, by rejecting her initial request to be isolated, they left her husband and her daughter also at potential risk of infection.

The incubation period of MERS is 2 to 14 days, and it is believed that patients are not contagious during that period. A fever above 38 C [100 F] is considered one of the typical symptoms of MERS, along with coughing and shortness of breath.

The Health Ministry explained that the 4th patient's fever on [21 May 2015] didn't reach 38 C [100 F], and she, therefore, wasn't considered a potential MERS patient.

Dr. Kim Woo-joo, who is also the head of the Transgovernmental Enterprise for Pandemic Influenza in Korea, said the 4th patient should have been isolated in a medical facility even if her fever wasn't above 38 C [100 F].

"I think (the government) should have been more flexible with the particular case," he told The Korea Herald. "I think the ministry was focusing too much on the rules that only those whose fever is above 38 C [100 F] should be quarantined. For the 4th patient, however, they should have taken into account that she was in the same room as 3 other confirmed MERS patients and she, in fact, nursed one of them."

Asked whether the 4th patient's spouse and daughter should be isolated, Kim said the ministry should consult with the 4th patient 1st. "If she physically stayed away from her family -- at least 2 meters away at all times -- in the house, I think the chances (of infection) aren't very high," he said.

A total of 63 individuals, including health care workers and the patients' families, were being monitored for possible infection on Tuesday [26 May 2015].

MERS is known to be caused by coronaviruses, a large family of viruses that cause a range of illnesses in humans from the common cold to severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS]. There is no known cure or vaccine for MERS, which has a fatality rate of 40.7 percent.

More than 95 percent of the confirmed cases worldwide were in the Middle East, particularly Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. The 1st Korean MERS patient was diagnosed with the disease on [20 May 2015], following his trip to the Middle East from [18 Apr 2015 to 3 May 2015].

Since it was 1st identified in 2012 in Saudi Arabia, 1142 people from 23 countries have been infected by the virus. Among them, 465 died from the disease.

[This report provides details of the 4th confirmed case of MERS-CoV infection in South Korea, the daughter/caretaker of the hospital "roommate" of the index case. Exposure to the MERS-CoV could have occurred with the index case, or caring for her father, the 2nd case in this nosocomial cluster.

Given the experience globally with the SARS-CoV (severe acute respiratory syndrome) in 2003, and now with MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome), one wonders why there hasn't been an international movement among healthcare professionals for immediate respiratory precautions when treating febrile respiratory illnesses in the healthcare environment, including the use of respiratory filters as well as admitting these patients into "private" rooms where there are no roommates. - Mod.MPP]

[Since the last MERS-CoV update, there have been an additional 4 cases, 4 fatalities and one recovery reported by the Saudi MOH, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in Saudi Arabia to 1006 including 440 deaths (case fatality rate 43.7 percent). It appears as though transmission of the MERS-CoV is ongoing in Hufof (Hufoof, Hafoof), with newly confirmed cases giving a positive history of contact with known case(s) prior to the onset of their illness. In the earlier reports of cases in Hufof, there was mention that many of the cases belonged to a large extended family that shared the same household. It would be of interest to know whether these additional cases are part of the same household or whether they involve contact within the healthcare environment (see section [8] below).

Between 18 and 23 May [2015], the National IHR Focal Point for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia notified WHO of 4 additional cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection, including one death.

Details of the cases are as follows:

1- A 77-year-old female from Hafouf city developed symptoms on 17 May [2015] and was admitted to hospital on the same day. A nasopharyngeal swab tested positive for MERS-CoV on 22 May [2015]. The patient has comorbidities. She was admitted to the same hospital as a laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV case (case 2 - see below). Investigation of history of exposure to other known risk factors in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms is ongoing. Currently, the patient is in critical condition in ICU. [Reported by MOH as newly confirmed on 23 May 2015 and as a fatality on 25 May 2015 (see newly confirmed case No. 4 and fatality No.2 in section [2] above. - Mod.MPP]

2- A 48-year-old male from Hafouf city developed symptoms on 1 May [2015] and was admitted to hospital on 10 May [2015]. The patient, who has comorbidities, was initially diagnosed with a cardiovascular condition. He was transferred to a cardiac center in Hafouf city on 14 May [2015]. On 20 May [2015], a nasopharyngeal swab tested positive for MERS-CoV, which led to the patient being transferred to the MERS-CoV reference hospital in Hafouf on the same day. He was admitted to the same ward and treated by the same health workers as a laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV case that was reported in a previous DON on 24 May [2015] (case n. 12). The patient has no history of exposure to other known risk factors in the 14 days prior to onset of symptoms. Currently, he is in critical condition in ICU. [Reported as a newly confirmed case on 21 May 2015 - Mod.MPP]

3- A 73-year-old female from Aflaj City developed symptoms on 14 May [2015] while admitted to hospital since 2 May [2015] due to an unrelated medical condition. The patient had comorbidities. A nasopharyngeal swab tested positive for MERS-CoV on 17 May [2015]. Investigation of history of exposure to known risk factors in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms is ongoing. The patient passed away on 18 May [2015]. [Reported as a newly confirmed case and fatality on 18 May 2015. - Mod.MPP]

4- A 59-year-old, non-national female from Riyadh city developed symptoms on 15 May [2015] and was admitted to hospital in Riyadh on 16 May [2015]. A nasopharyngeal swab tested positive for MERS-CoV on 17 May [2015]. The patient has comorbidities. Investigation of history of exposure to known risk factors in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms is ongoing. Currently, the patient is in stable condition isolated at home. [Reported as a newly confirmed case on 18 May 2015. - Mod.MPP]

Contact tracing of household contacts and healthcare contacts is ongoing for these cases.

The National IHR Focal Point for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia also notified WHO of the death of 3 previously reported MERS-CoV cases. The cases were reported in previous DONs on 24 May [2015] (case n. 5, 9) and on 8 May [2015] (case n. 1).

Globally, WHO has been notified of 1139 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including at least 431 related deaths.

[Two of the 4 newly confirmed cases in the above WHO report had possible transmission of the MERS-CoV in the healthcare environment, as they were hospitalized for other medical reasons prior to the onset of the MERS-CoV associated illness. One of these cases (the 48-year-old male from Hafouf (Hufof, Hufoof, Hafoof)) was admitted to a healthcare facility in a town where known MERS-CoV transmission was currently ongoing. The other, the 73-year-old female from Aflaj (Al Aflaj) was admitted to a hospital in a town where MERS-CoV has not been reported within 14 days of the onset of illness in this woman. Does this represent silent transmission of the MERS-CoV? It will be interesting to learn additional information on this case, presumably from more extensive investigations.

On 18 May 2015, the IHR National Focal Point of the United Arab Emirates notified WHO of one additional case of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection.

Details of the case are as follows:

The patient is a 33-year-old, non-national male from Al Ain. He has a history of contact with MERS-CoV infected camels imported from Oman (see DON of 18 May [2015]). A sputum sample tested positive for MERS-CoV on 17 May [2015], whereupon the patient was admitted to hospital. He was asymptomatic at the time of laboratory testing. He has no comorbidities and no history of exposure to other known risk factors in the 14 days prior to detection. Currently, the case is still asymptomatic and in stable condition in a negative pressure room on a ward.

Contact tracing of household contacts and healthcare contacts is ongoing for the case. The National IHR Focal Point of the United Arab Emirates informed the National IHR Focal Point of Oman about this case. Investigation of human contacts of the MERS-CoV infected camels is ongoing in Oman.

Globally, WHO has been notified of 1135 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including at least 427 related deaths.

[This report provides details on a 2nd case of MERS-CoV infection associated with individuals transporting MERS-CoV infected camels to the UAE from Oman. Both cases thus far have been asymptomatic infections detected as follow-up to the identification of MERS-CoV infected camels in the UAE. One can't help but wonder whether these asymptomatic infections can also lead to transmission among close contacts. It will be interesting to learn the results of the contact tracing conducted on this case and of the 1st reported case.

On 20 May 2015, the National IHR Focal Point of the Republic of Korea notified WHO of the 1st laboratory confirmed case of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection. On 21 May [2015], 2 additional confirmed cases were reported.

Details of the cases are as follows:

The 1st case is a 68-year-old male with the following travel history: [18-29 Apr 2015], Bahrain; [29-30 Apr 2015], United Arab Emirates; [30 Apr 2015 to 1 May 2015], Bahrain; 1-2 May [2015], the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia; 2 May [2015], Bahrain; and 2-3 May [2015], Qatar. The patient arrived at Korea's Incheon International airport via Qatar on 4 May [2015]. He was asymptomatic on arrival. The patient developed symptoms on 11 May [2015] and sought medical care at a clinic from [12 May 2015 to 15 May 2015] on an outpatient basis. He was then admitted to hospital on 15 May [2015] and discharged on 17 May [2015]. On the evening of discharge, the patient visited the emergency department of another hospital. A sputum sample tested positive for MERS-CoV on 20 May [2015], whereupon he was transferred to the nationally designated treatment facility for isolation. The patient has no history of exposure to known risk factors in the 14 days prior to detection. Investigation of the source of infection is ongoing.

The 2 additional cases were laboratory-confirmed for MERS-CoV on 21 May [2015]. One is a household contact. The other is a patient who shared the same hospital room with the 1st case. Currently, all 3 patients are in stable condition.

Contact tracing of household contacts and healthcare contacts is ongoing for the cases.

Globally, WHO has been notified of 1134 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including at least 427 related deaths.

[From the above given itinerary of this index case in the South Korean nosocomial cluster of MERS-CoV, it seems next to impossible to pinpoint where transmission may have occurred, as Qatar, UAE, and Saudi Arabia have all reported MERS-CoV infected individuals recently. Hopefully, a more detailed investigation in each of the countries may potentially identify where transmission of the virus occurred. The above report provides information on the 1st 3 cases confirmed in South Korea, and the 2 media reports in sections [1] and [2] provide information on the 4th and 5th cases. Given the history of the patient's outpatient management initially, and inpatient management sharing a room with another patient, one would not be surprised if there were additional cases confirmed in the coming days. - Mod.MPP]
