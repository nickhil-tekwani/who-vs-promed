Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1 (NC_1): Orchies, Nord
Date of start of the outbreak: 8 Dec 2017
Outbreak status: resolved on 8 Dec 2017
Epidemiological unit: farm
Total animals affected
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Birds / 12 000 / 300 / 150 / 11 850 / 0
Affected population: In a broiler farm with pigeons, vaccinated against Newcastle disease as per corresponding rules, some pigeons presented stiff neck, lethargy, drop of water intake, egg drop and then mortality. The national reference laboratory could confirm the presence of virus APMV-1 thanks to analysis carried out in the framework of the clinical suspicion notified on [Mon 11 Dec 2017]. Animals were killed and destroyed on [Fri 22 Dec 2017].

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost
Birds / 2.50 / 1.25 / 50.00 / 100
(Lost refers to removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Contact with wild species.
Epidemiological comments: As per corresponding rules, movement restriction of animals and animal by-products and reinforced surveillance were implemented in the protection and surveillance zones (respectively within 3 km [1.86 miles approx.] and 10 km [6.21 miles approx.] radius around the outbreak).

Control measures
Measures applied: surveillance within containment and/or protection zone; traceability, official disposal of carcasses, by-products and waste, stamping-out, zoning, disinfection, vaccination permitted (if a vaccine exists), no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: No other measures

Diagnostic test results:
NSES National reference laboratory for avian influenza and Newcastle disease, Ploufragan (National laboratory)
Species / Test / Test date / Result
Birds / nucleotide sequencing / 20 Dec 2017 / Positive
Birds / real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) / 20 Dec 2017 / Positive

Future reporting

["Newcastle disease is a viral disease that can affect a wide variety of avian species, both wild birds and domestic fowl.

The disease is of great concern throughout much of the world's agricultural community because it is highly contagious and can cause severe disease in poultry.

Strains that produce mild and moderate forms of the disease are sometimes found in domestic poultry and pigeons. The most severe forms of the disease, known as velogenic Newcastle disease (VND), are caused by highly pathogenic strains of the virus. VND can cause severe mortality in chickens.

Newcastle disease in birds may affect the respiratory, nervous and gastrointestinal systems.

The clinical signs of Newcastle disease in domestic fowl may include the following: decreased egg production; depression; diarrhea; high number of sudden deaths in a flock; or respiratory distress.

Signs of the disease in wild birds occur mainly in the young and include: clenched toes; high number of sudden deaths in wild birds, particularly cormorants (wild aquatic, migratory birds); inability to walk or fly; lack of muscular coordination; muscle tremors; paralysis of one or both legs or wings; twisting of the head and neck; and walking in circles.

Newcastle disease is mainly transmitted by direct contact with diseased or carrier birds.

Infected birds may shed the virus in their feces, contaminating the environment. The virus can survive for days in litter, feed, water, soil, carcasses, eggs and feathers. The disease spreads rapidly among birds in close confinement.

The virus can also spread unintentionally through the movement of contaminated material, footwear and equipment.

In humans, the Newcastle disease virus can cause conjunctivitis (pink eye). Such cases occur occasionally in laboratory or farm workers that are not wearing protective eyewear. The risk of contracting this form of disease by the public is minimal, particularly if gloves are worn to handle sick birds. Hands should also be washed with soap and water after handling sick birds". http://www.inspection.gc.ca/animals/terrestrial-animals/diseases/reportable/nd/fact-sheet/eng/1330202454619/1330202602677
