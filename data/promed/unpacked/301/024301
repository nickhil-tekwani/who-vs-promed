[The above text was selected, translated and summarised by the
communicator (FMD News) from the website of Viet Nam's Department of
animal health (Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development),
available at <http://www.cucthuy.gov.vn/index.php>.
The website, under auspices of OIE and FAO, methodically publishes
daily bulletins on 3 animal diseases in Viet Nam: Avian influenza, FMD
and PRRS. The above information is assiduously and commendably
translated, summarised and circulated by FMD News, Davis.

The bulletin of 18 Feb 2011 includes the following additional
information. The 18 provinces found infected by FMD are: Son La, Quang
Ninh, Lang Son, Bac Kan, Cao Bang, Dien Bien, Thai Nguyen, Ha Giang,
Kon Tum, Hoa Binh, Tuyen Quang, Quang Ngai, Yen Bai, Phu Tho, Dong
Nai, Tien Giang, Long An and Lao Cai. Lao Cai has recorded the most
recent cases.

Viet Nam has been inbvolved, during recent years, in an accelerated
development of the local dairy industry. This ambitious project
involves the import of FMD-susceptible heifers for breeding from
countries which have the status of FMD-freedom without vaccination.
Their import into the local, FMD-infected environment, has put the
authorities in a precarious situation since those animals have to be
vaccinated and develop solid immunity prior to being potentially
exposed to the locally circulating virus. Since the use of the vaccine
is prohibited in the countries of origin, the vaccine should be
efficacious and deserves to be applied in secure, quarantine
conditions. It seems that this operation is being applied with
considerable success. - Mod.AS]
