The toll due to different types of encephalitis has mounted to 560 this
year [2009] in eastern Uttar Pradesh as one more child succumbed to the
brain fever, an official said today [13 Dec 2009]. Additional director
(health) LP Rawat said 5 new patients with symptoms of acute encephalitis
syndrome and Japanese encephalitis have been admitted to BRD Medical
College Hospital and government hospitals of the adjoining districts. "5
deaths have occurred during the past one week," he said, adding that a
child patient from Bihar died last night [12 Dec 2009].

He said 63 patients are undergoing treatment at BRD Medical College while 5
are being treated at other government hospitals of the region.

[The number of encephalitis cases has increased in this area by 8 since the
5 Dec 2009 report (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20091205.4153). Other than
Japanese encephalitis virus, these reports continue to provide no
information about the etiological agent (presumably a virus) responsible
for the acute encephalitis syndrome mentioned, that may be due to
enteroviruses or Nipah virus.
