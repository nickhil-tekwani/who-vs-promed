The Peruvian Health Ministry announced Thursday that over 30 children under

region of Cusco since April.
According to the ministry, more than 790 people have contracted pneumonia
and 36,200 others suffered from serious respiratory diseases in the
area.The ministry said that the temperature in Cusco, a high-altitude
mountainous region, will drop to 27 degrees Celsius below zero in the
coming days, and health authorities are taking preventive measures to keep
pneumonia from further spreading.

[According to the newswire above, this has been an unusually severe winter
in Cusco this year. This is the respiratory illness season, and this is
not the first year that there have been reports of unusually high numbers
of pneumonia and respiratory deaths from the Cuzco area. In the
Epidemiologic Bulletin for week 22 (30 May - 5 Jun 2004) there was an alert
on the increase in acute respiratory illness
<http://www.oge.sld.pe/vigilancia/boletin.htm>. According to this alert
there were 67 666 cases of acute respiratory infection, with the
Departments most affected being San Martin, Apurimac, Ayacucho, Cusco,
Huanuco and Pasco. There were 1106 cases of pneumonia reported in children
less than 5 years of age.
For those who do not know the area, the city of Cusco (where the tourists
above visited) is in the Andes Mountains at an altitude of approximately
3400 meters (11 600 feet) above sea level. Healthy tourists have been
known to have significant problems adjusting to this altitude. Many
visiting tourists have underlying illnesses that would predispose to
additional respiratory distress at this altitude, even in the absence of a
superimposed respiratory viral illness. That being said, the onset of an
acute respiratory illness can lead to significant problems in those
individuals with underlying disease. More information from knowledgeable
sources on both the situation in Cusco, as well as a more detailed
description of the outbreak among the tourists would be appreciated. - Mod.MPP]
