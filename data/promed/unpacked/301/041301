Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Vectors; Contact
with wild species
Epidemiological comments: Cases reported have all been near forested
areas with some areas also being near rivers. The Ministry of Health
conducts vector control activities in the affected areas. The
increase in mosquitoes has been reported countrywide. All samples
submitted to the Reference Laboratory have been tested for West Nile
virus with negative results.

Measures applied: Control of arthropods; Quarantine; Vaccination in
response to the outbreak (s)

Details Polyvalent inactivated vaccine

No treatment of affected animals

Measures to be applied: No other measures

Laboratory name and type: National Veterinary Services Laboratory

[The OIE report earlier on 25 Sep 2009 -- see references below -- was
an immediate notification report but did not contain the specific
detailed data on outbreak farms presented here. Additonally, one more
administrative division Orange Walk in the North and West portion of
the country is included in this report. The location of the outbreaks
can be seen on the map attached to the OIE report referenced above. - Mod.PC.

It is critical to know which VEE virus subtype is involved in these
outbreaks because the epidemiologies of epizootic equine subtypes
(IAB and C) and endemic subtypes (ID and IE) are quite different. If
it is VEE subtype IAB or C, and mosquito vectors are abundant, then
there is risk of rapid spread in the equine population with
spill-over into humans. Subtype IAB was responsible for the 1969-72
outbreak in Central America and Mexico, reaching into south Texas,
and subtype C, periodically has caused outbreaks in northern South
America. Equine animals are the key amplifying hosts. Subtype IAB has
not been confirmed since 1972 in Central America or Mexico. The
vaccine is made from the equine epizootic strain. In southern Mexico
in 1993, 1996 and probably 1999, subtype IE caused cases of equine
encephalitis but with no reported human cases. In a 2001-02 study,
this subtype was isolated from sentinel hamsters, which is endemic
there and probably in Guatemala, maintained in foci in!
volving rodents (cotton rats, rice rats) and opossums) and _Culex_
subgenus _melanoconion_ _taeniopus_ - Mod.TY.]
