Animal diseases seem to be stalking Bengal with the district
administration [in Cooch Behar, West Bengal] announcing that the
anthrax bacteria was detected in cows that died in Mathabhanga
subdivision recently.

Cooch Behar district magistrate Rajesh Kumar Sinha said today [4 Feb
2008] that a family in Bhojanerchhara village, 34 km (21 mi) from
[Cooch Behar], lost 5 cows last Friday [1 Feb 2008]. "We had
collected the samples and sent them to the animal resource
development (ARD) laboratory in Cooch Behar for tests. The result was
positive for anthrax."

Sinha said another family in the same village had lost one cow to the
disease. At Jotpatki, in Mathabhanga, 7 more cows had died on 31 Jan
and 1 Feb [2008]. Samples of these animals, too, have been sent for
tests. "Given the situation, we have decided to vaccinate cattle in
the area from tomorrow," he added.

ARD [Animal Resources Department] sources said all the dead cows were
suffering from fever and died after bleeding from the mouth, typical
symptoms of cattle infected with the anthrax bacillus.

"The dead animals have been buried more than 8 ft (2.5 m)
underground," said Tapan Roy, the deputy director of the ARD in Cooch
Behar. Cows infected with anthrax bacteria do not survive for long
and stop giving milk. "There is no cause for panic, but care should
be taken not to eat contaminated beef," an official of the department said.

In June last year [2007], 2 persons died of anthrax in Murshidabad
after being admitted to the Infectious Diseases Hospital in Calcutta.
32 others were infected.

The North Dinajpur administration has imposed Section 144 in Itahar
block as the district gears up for a mop-up operation to search for
hidden poultry. The subdivisional officer of Raiganj, Asoke Kumar
Das, said this afternoon that the order issued yesterday [3 Feb 2008]
was for 56 villages. "We apprehend that there might be an attempt to
smuggle out poultry by people travelling in groups. So the assembly
of more than 5 persons has been prohibited," said Das. He said the
order has been conveyed to local panchayats [local assemblies] and
announced over the public address system.

Vaccination drive has been started at Bhojaner-chhara village under
the Nishiganj-I gram panchayat in Mathabhanga-II block and the
adjoining areas to prevent the spread of anthrax among the cattle. A
massive awareness drive has been launched in these villages. The
villagers of the area have been asked not to consume the meat of dead
cows that have died of anthrax. They were also asked to bury dead
domestic cows. Removal of skins of the dead cows has also been discouraged.

Though a massive vaccination drive has been launched, not a single
case of anthrax infection among human beings has been reported till
now, the Cooch Behar DM, Mr Rajesh Kumar Sinha said.

The deaths of 6 cows on Friday night [1 Feb 2008] have made the
locals panicky about anthrax outbreak at Bhojaner-chhara village. On
being informed the ARD personnel had collected blood samples for
examination. As the samples tested positive for anthrax, it was
decided that cattle of the entire area would be vaccinated to stop
the disease from spreading.

The joint commissioner of the Union animal resources development
department, Dr S Negi, arrived [in Cooch Behar] this afternoon [5 Feb
2008] from New Delhi to review the situation that has arisen
following the outbreak of bird flu and anthrax. He would also
supervise the mop up drive, which is going on after the completion of
culling in the villages from where the avian flu cases have been
reported, according to the Cooch Behar ADM (D), Mr Pannalal
Mahapatra. The joint commissioner would visit all the bird flu
affected villages in Dinhata-I, Dinhata-II, and Mathabhanga-I blocks,
and also the anthrax-affected village in Mathabhanga-II block.

The quarantined members of the culling teams are becoming aggrieved.
Many of them have alleged that the administration has failed to
arrange for adequate food and other basic amenities for them. In this
cold it is hard to live somewhere else without proper blankets, they
said. When inquired about the allegation, Mr Mahapatra said that
arrangements have been made to hand over food tokens and better
bedding facilities from today [5 Feb 2008].

[Reports out of West Bengal have varied somewhat in the numbers of
cattle affected but the most consistent are those posted. In spite of
the wording it appears that to date there have been no human cases.
The West Bengal authorities need to sit down and consider planning a
statewide regular vaccination of cattle. Reactive responses are both
very expensive and of limited effectiveness. The problem has been
going on for some time in the state. It should not be difficult to
delineate those areas with regular outbreaks needing immediate
action, and to set up a proper surveillance programme statewide to
look for and rapidly report unexpected livestock deaths so that they
can be promptly investigated. Latterly, numerous reports of suspected
cases indicate not only a sensitive public concern but also
uncertainty as to what is happening. They may also indicate a wider
distribution of this disease than is presently being diagnosed.
