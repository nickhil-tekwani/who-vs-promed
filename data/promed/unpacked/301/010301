One of our larger dairy cattle farmers has reported an outbreak in dairy cattle with a high number of cases of the respiratory disease infectious bovine rhinotracheitis, caused by the bovine herpes virus 1 (BHV-1), which is extremely infectious. Another farm, 5 km [3.2 mi] away, also has cases.

The main outbreaks are in Pleine-Fougeres, situated in the departement d'Ille-et-Vilaine, region Bretagne.

The farmer is extremely concerned about his cattle and says [the disease] can cause abortions.

Is there a vaccine against this virus?

[Yes, vaccines (inactivated and attenuated live) against "infectious bovine rhinotracheitis/infectious pustular vulvovaginitis (IBR/IPV)", caused by bovine herpesvirus 1 (BoHV-1), are available. This virus is distributed worldwide. Following acute infection of the respiratory or genital tract, BoHV1 undergoes cycles of latency to reactivation in local sensory neurons, leading to shedding and transmission of the virus via the respiratory, ocular, or genital secretions as well as the semen from infected bulls. Reactivation may be triggered by stressful events (parturition, diet, dramatic weather conditions, transport, and animal mixing, etc.), immunosuppression, or treatments with corticosteroids.

The vaccines protect cattle clinically in case of infection and markedly reduce the subsequent shedding of field virus but may not prevent field virus infection of individual animals, though spreading of wild-type virus in infected herds is effectively reduced.

The economic impact of BoHV1 mainly results from restrictions in livestock trade. Indeed, IBR/IPV is OIE-listed and included in its Terrestrial Animal Health Code; it is also associated with additional guarantees at the European level. Several member states of the EU have either successfully eradicated IBR (Austria, Denmark, Germany, Finland, Sweden, Switzerland) or implemented an EU-approved compulsory program at the national or regional levels (Belgium, Czech Republic, Italy). In such countries/regions/farms, vaccination is excluded.

In France, a voluntary eradication program based on the test-and-removal strategy without vaccination started in 1996. Concomitantly, a mandatory control plan based on serological testing together with vaccination and/or removal of positive animals was implemented in 2006. A steady increasing number of certified BoHV1-free herds was observed at the national level (from 49% in 2006 to 69% in 2016), leading the French Ministry for agriculture to approve a unique compulsory program since May 2016 in order to speed up the eradication process. The surveillance of dairy cattle farms is performed by serological bulk-milk testing. Farms with positive results are then retested using blood samples from animals older than 24 months.

According to a media report dated 13 Jun 2019, IBR was apparently absent from Brittany for 40 years before resurfacing in 2018 in Ille-et-Vilaine, affecting 5 flocks. Each time, about 80% of the population of the herd had to be slaughtered. To allow the affected farmers to recover, the sanitary defense group (GDS) of Bretagne, an association that manages health issues on farms in the region, took care of the analyses and compensated the slaughter of the concerned flocks (see https://www.ouest-france.fr/bretagne/ille-et-vilaine-une-maladie-disparue-depuis-40-ans-de-retour-dans-des-elevages-bovins-6396318).

It will be interesting to note if the dairy farms addressed in Ms Baekeland's query are included in the regional or national programs.

The French IBR/IPV eradication program has been visited recently (Ref 1). Some of the above information was derived from this paper.
