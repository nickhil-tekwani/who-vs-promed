[The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/diseases/hanta/hps/index.htm> identifies
hantaviruses in the New World as follows. North America: hantaviruses in
the New World are associated with hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS).
Sigmodontine rodents carry the hantaviruses that cause HPS and are found
throughout the Americas. Sin Nombre virus, carried by _Peromyscus
maniculatus_, is the predominant cause of HPS in the United States and
Canada. Mononghela, New York, Bayou, and Black Creek Canal viruses also
cause HPS and are found in eastern Canada and the eastern and south eastern
US. In South and Central America, hantaviruses that have been identified as
causing HPS are Andes virus in Argentina and Chile; Andes-like viruses
including Oran, Lechiguanas, and Hu39694 in Argentina; Laguna Negra virus
in Bolivia and Paraguay; Bermejo virus in Argentina; Juquitiba virus in
Brazil; and Choclo virus in Panama. Numerous other hantaviruses have been
identified but have not been linked to human disease. - Mod.CP]

Colorado: Boulder County's 1st case of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome
-------------------------------------------------
Health officials warned residents to take precautions after identifying
Boulder County's 1st-ever human case of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome. A 24
year old researcher at the University of Colorado in Boulder caught the
respiratory illness, which is typically spread by exposure to rodent
droppings, while doing field work on rodents, CU spokeswoman Jeannine
Malmsbury said. "He was doing research at several different sites in the
county," Malmsbury said. She declined to identify which department he
worked in.
The man was particularly vulnerable because he had regular contact with
rodents, Boulder County Public Health epidemiologist Heath Harmon said.
Officials said they were prohibited from identifying exactly where in the
county the man lives. Investigators are working to determine where he
caught the disease, Harmon said. "It does appear the infection was acquired
here in Boulder County," he said.
The man checked into Boulder Community Hospital's emergency room on 15 Jun
2005, complaining of fever, chills and aches, according to county
spokeswoman Patricia Demchak. On Tuesday [21 Jun 2005?], doctors discharged
the man, who never developed the respiratory problems most often associated
with the illness, Harmon said.
Hantavirus is generally spread by deer mice or other rodents and is present
in their urine, droppings, and nesting material, according to the federal
Centers for Disease Control. Humans usually catch the disease from
breathing air contaminated with the virus and generally show symptoms of
the illness 1-6 weeks after exposure.
The Boulder County case marks the 8th in Colorado this year, Harmon said.
The disease is likely to spike this year because there was considerable
rainfall this spring, allowing for more vegetation and a larger rodent
population, Harmon said. "If people are seeing rodents in and around their
home, they really need to take some precautions," he said. "If you don't
have exposure to rodents, generally speaking, we're not looking at a big risk."
People who have vacation cabins in rural parts of the county should be
especially cautious of rodents that may be living in the building, Harmon
said. Officials recommend setting traps to control the rodent population
year-round. Areas infected with mouse droppings or nesting materials should
be cleaned with a mixture of bleach and water. People should avoid stirring
up dust while cleaning a rodent-infested area.
Epidemiologists first documented hantavirus in May 1993 after several
residents of the Four Corners region developed severe respiratory problems.
Since then, there have been 387 cases [396 as of 6 Jul 2005] in the United
States, 35 of which were in Colorado, according to a 3 May release by the CDC.

A 2nd University of Colorado (CU) researcher studying rodents at several
field sites in Boulder County contracted hantavirus earlier this month, on
Mon 18 Jul 2005. The 22 year old woman's illness marks the county's 2nd
recorded human case of hantavirus infection. The woman works with the 24
year old man who was hospitalized with the county's 1st hantavirus case in
June after doing field research on rodents for CU, school spokeswoman
Jeannine Malmsbury confirmed.
Rodent researchers at CU are taking extra precautions to prevent additional
infections, Malmsbury said. "They're using respiratory protection at all
times in the process," Malmsbury said. "They wear air-purifying respirators
and latex gloves."
Rodent research is being conducted at several sites in Boulder County, but
not on the CU-Boulder campus, she stressed. The 22 year old woman went to a
local hospital complaining of aches and a fever on 6 Jul 2005. She
ultimately developed hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, a potentially fatal
respiratory illness associated with the virus, Boulder County Public Health
epidemiologist Heath Harmon said. She has recovered and went home from the
hospital on 12 Jul 2005.
Investigators are optimistic that a 2nd case will increase their odds of
pinpointing the source of the outbreak, Harmon said. "Because we have 2
cases now with similar exposures by occupation, it opens up the
investigation more," Harmon said. "We have more people to talk to."
Hantavirus is generally spread by deer mice or other rodents and is present
in their urine, droppings and nesting material, according to the federal
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Humans usually catch the
disease from breathing air contaminated with the virus and generally show
symptoms of the illness 1-6 weeks after exposure. Hantavirus is likely to
spike this year because there was considerable rainfall this spring,
allowing for more vegetation and a larger rodent population, Harmon
said."We've been very fortunate up until now to avoid hantavirus
[infection]," he said.
He urged residents to take precautions and rodent-proof their homes.
Officials recommend setting traps to control the rodent population
year-round. Areas infected with mouse droppings or nesting materials should
be cleaned with a mixture of bleach and water. People should avoid stirring
up dust while cleaning a rodent-infested area.

[These are not the 1st cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome contracted in
the course of research on these viruses (see: Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome
update 2004 - the Americas (05)20041125.3154). The Morbidity and Mortality
Weekly Report for Fri 26 Nov 2004
<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5346a3.htm> reported that, in
early July 2004, a wildlife sciences graduate student, a man aged 32 years,
visited an emergency department (ED) in Blacksburg, Virginia, with
complaints of fever, cough, and sore chest since the previous evening. The
ED clinician noted possible rodent exposure in the medical history of the
patient. Examination revealed a temperature of 102.7 deg F (39.3 deg C) and
an oxygen saturation of 96 per cent (normal). A complete blood count (CBC)
revealed a left shift with no bands (granulocytes: 87 per cent) and
lymphopenia (lymphocytes: 400/mm3). Radiographic examination indicated
faint right-sided pneumonia. In the ED, the graduate student began vomiting
and was admitted for intravenous hydration and parenteral antibiotics. He
became progressively hypoxic, requiring supplemental oxygen, bilevel
positive airway pressure, and eventually intubation with mechanical
ventilation. Repeated radiographs revealed bilateral pulmonary edema.
According to interviews with his coworkers, the patient had spent the
previous month trapping small mammals for study and handling mice
(_Peromyscus_ spp.) daily. 2 students and a recent graduate who had worked
with the patient reported that none of them had consistently worn gloves
while handling rodents or washed their hands after handling rodents or
their excreta, even before eating. The students also reported frequent
rodent bites on their bare hands.
The next day, the patient was hypotensive, requiring intravenous pressor
support. He received activated protein C to prevent disseminated
intravascular coagulation (DIC). A repeat CBC revealed bands (granulocytes:
20 per cent) and a decreased platelet count (115 000/mm3); urinalysis
indicated mild hematuria and proteinuria. Despite aggressive supportive
care, the patient's status continued to deteriorate, and he died on the 3rd
day of his hospitalization. Differential diagnosis included tularemia,
pneumococcal sepsis, and HPS. Serum specimens submitted to ARUP
Laboratories (Salt Lake City, Utah) were positive for both IgG and IgM
antibodies to hantaviruses; these test results were confirmed by CDC. A
spleen biopsy was also positive by immunohistochemistry for hantavirus
antigens. A serum sample was positive for hantavirus RNA by real-time
reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Sequencing of the
amplified nucleic acid identified the virus as _Monongahela hantavirus_.
The circumstances of the exposure of the 2 research workers at the
university of Colorado remains to be explained, but they appeared to be
aware of the hazards and adequately equipped. Further information is
awaited. - Mod.CP]
