California Department of Public Health [CDPH] Director and State Health Officer Dr Karen Smith said that California has seen an increase in syphilis cases among women, pregnant women, and newborns over the past 2 years.

"The increase in congenital syphilis is particularly concerning," Dr Smith said. "Congenital syphilis occurs when syphilis is transmitted from an infected mother to her child during pregnancy. It is a needless tragedy that can be prevented with good prenatal care and timely and effective treatment."

From 2012 to 2014, the annual number of reported early syphilis cases among women more than doubled from 248 cases to 594. The annual number of reported congenital syphilis cases more than tripled during the same period, from 30 to 100.

Syphilitic stillbirths also increased, from one case in 2012 to 6 cases in 2014. The increasing trend of syphilis among women appears to continue in 2015.

Most of the congenital syphilis cases have been reported in the Central Valley and Los Angeles County.

CDPH has not identified a cause for the increase in congenital syphilis, which is often associated with poverty and lack of access to health care. Most of the women who gave birth to babies with congenital syphilis did not receive adequate or timely prenatal care.

[In contrast to the epidemiology of syphilis in many localities in the US (including the state of California) and other countries (see prior ProMED-mail posts below), where the increasing incidence of syphilis has been occurring mainly in men who have to sex with men (MSM), the news report above says the incidence of syphilis has been increasing in women, pregnant women, and newborns in California since 2012. This may be a spillover of the ongoing syphilis epidemic in MSM that could be attributable to MSM who also have unprotected sex with women.

Most of the congenital syphilis cases are said to be occurring in the Central Valley and Los Angeles County of California. The Central Valley, with a population of about 6.5 million, is a large, flat valley that dominates the geographical center of the US state of California and is known for its agriculture (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Valley_(California)). It is 40 to 60 miles (60 to 100 km) wide and approximately 450 miles (720 km) long from north to south and is separated by a mountain range from Los Angeles to the south (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehachapi_Mountains#/media/File:Wpdms_shdrlfi020l_tehachapi_mountains.jpg).

The following is extracted from the CDC STD treatment guidelines for pregnant women (http://www.cdc.gov/std/treatment/2010/specialpops.htm#a1 and http://www.cdc.gov/std/tg2015/syphilis-pregnancy.htm):

A serologic test for syphilis should be performed on all pregnant women at the 1st prenatal visit. In populations in which delivery of prenatal care is not optimal, serologic screening test for syphilis (and treatment, if that test is reactive) should be performed at the time that a pregnancy is confirmed.

Antepartum screening by nontreponemal antibody testing is typical, but treponemal antibody testing is being used in some settings. Pregnant women with reactive treponemal screening tests should have additional quantitative nontreponemal testing, because titers are essential for monitoring treatment response.

For communities and populations in which the prevalence of syphilis is high and for women at high risk for syphilis, serologic testing should also be performed twice during the third trimester: once at 28-32 weeks' gestation and again at delivery.

Some states require all women to be screened at delivery. Infants should not be discharged from the hospital unless the syphilis serologic status of the mother has been determined at least one time during pregnancy and preferably again at delivery. Any woman who delivers a stillborn infant should be tested for syphilis.

The risk for antepartum fetal infection or congenital syphilis is related to the stage of syphilis during pregnancy, with the highest risk occurring with the primary and secondary stage. Quantitative maternal nontreponemal titer, especially if >1:8, might be a marker of early infection and bacteremia. However, risk for fetal infection is still significant in pregnant women with late latent syphilis and low titers. Pregnant women with stable, serofast low antibody titers who have previously been treated for syphilis might not require additional treatment; however, rising or persistently high antibody titers might indicate reinfection or treatment failure, and treatment should be considered.

All women who have syphilis should also be offered testing for HIV infection.

Penicillin G is the only known effective antimicrobial for treating maternal infection, preventing maternal transmission of syphilis to the fetus, and treating fetal infection. Pregnant women should be treated with the penicillin regimen appropriate for their stage of infection, the regimens being the same as those for non-pregnant women. No proven alternatives to penicillin are available for treatment of syphilis during pregnancy. For women who have primary, secondary, or early latent syphilis, some recommend 2 doses of benzathine penicillin (Bicillin L-A) 2.4 million units IM administered 1 week apart. Because evidence is limited regarding the efficacy or safety of alternative antibiotics in pregnancy, women who report penicillin allergies should be evaluated and desensitized to penicillin if necessary. Data are insufficient to recommend ceftriaxone for treatment of maternal infection and prevention of congenital syphilis. - Mod.ML
