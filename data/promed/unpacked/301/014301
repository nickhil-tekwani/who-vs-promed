In Phuentsholing, some farmers are abandoning orange farming, failing
to get their return. Most of the orange orchards have now become dry
despite several efforts of the villagers to keep them alive.

A fungal disease called powdery mildew [as well as environmental
problems] are causes for the fall in orange production.

Farmers said they have raised the issue in the Goeg Yargay Tshogchung
[Block Development Committee], but nothing much has been done.

[Powdery mildew on orange and other citrus crops is caused by the
fungus _Oidium tingitaninum_. Powdery mildews are a group of fungi
which can lead to serious losses in many important crops. Other
species of _Oidium_ affect crops like mango, cashew and tomato.

The pathogens cause a white "powdery" growth on all aerial parts of
their hosts reducing photosynthetic potential and vigour of the
plant. Affected flowers and fruits drop prematurely, or fruit set may
be prevented. Spores are dispersed by wind, water, or mechanical
means. Between seasons, powdery mildew fungi survive on infected
plant parts and in debris such as fallen leaves. In citrus, disease
development is reported to be favoured by damp mornings with few
hours of sunshine. Disease management includes fungicides (for
citrus, sulphur products are used frequently) and cultural practices.

Besides powdery mildew and the environmental factors mentioned above,
orange crops in Bhutan are also seriously affected by huanglongbing
(citrus greening). For more information, see previous ProMED-mail
posts listed below.
