The report on cases of poliomyelitis, vaccine-associated paralytic
poliomyelitis (VAPP) and or acute flaccid paralysis in India cases by Steve
Berger raise questions as to the policy of relying on OPV alone in the push
to eradication.
During the 1970s, we faced polio epidemics in Gaza and the West Bank
despite good (75% ) coverage with OPV and the cases included some with 4
feedings of OPV. We succeeded in eliminating polio in these areas in the
late 1970s by a combined program of OPV and IPV, overcoming fresh
importation of the wild virus, interference with OPV by other enteroviruses
and VAPP (1-6). Only sporadic cases occurred in the early 1980s, and no
cases have been found since 1988. This was despite findings from time to
time of wild polio virus in the sewage of Gaza and other imported
diarrhoeal diseases such as a small cholera outbreak in 1994, resulting
from the return of many Palestinians to the area from all parts of the
Middle East where endemic poliovirus circulation was/is still prevalent.
The combination of OPV, either mixed or sequentially, can provide an
earlier control of the disease, because of the inherent advantages of each
vaccine. Israeli experience with IPV alone was a failure because it led to
a "'window of opportunity" for the virus among vulnerable persons over age
15 who had received OPV only in childhood, in the "Hadera outbreak" of 15
cases in 1988 (7).
The US adopted the combined/sequential approach for several years in the
late 1990s (8-10) until shifting to IPV only in 2000 (11). WHO has stuck
with OPV only, relying on National Immunization Days to make up for weak
routine coverage.This has been successful in many parts of the world (e.g.
South America).
The issue of final eradication may well necessitate a combined OPV/IPV to
eliminate VAPP as well as cases due to wild poliovirus, especially in areas
with less than ideal routine coverage with OPV, in such situations as
described in India (12).

As to the report from Stephen (Berger) I just wanted to point out (taking
into account that not all readers are "epidemiologists) that due to the
fact that most of the sick are children under 5 years old, polio must be
highly endemic [in India - many people are more aware of the plans of
eradication than of the big risk (and I must admit I realized the dramatic
situation only by reading the lines the second time) - so thanks to Stephen
- I hope all got the message!

[I cannot go on posting messages and data I do not understand. I cannot
tell from our own reports how many cases of paralytic poliomyelitis there
have been in vaccinated and in unvaccinated people in India or how many
virus isolates have been obtained from unvaccinated and vaccinated people,
or how much of the clinical paralysis observed has been due to wild-type
and vaccine virus and how much could be due to other causes, such as
Japanese encephalitis virus. VAPP, OPV, IPV -- I'm getting a headache!
Also, although it is fascinating, we do not intend to enter a discussion
regarding comparative usefulness of vaccination approaches. String cut.
Let's let W.H.O. and NGOs continue their good work on eradicating this
awful disease. - Mod.CHC
