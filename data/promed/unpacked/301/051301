In Spain, _Xanthomonas arboricola_ pv. _pruni_ (EPPO A2 List) is considered to be an emerging disease on stone fruit crops, and in particular on almond, which was previously not known to be a host plant.

The bacterium was 1st identified in 2002 in Badajoz (Extramadura) in Japanese plum (_Prunus salicina_). Since then, several outbreaks have been detected in the following regions: Andalucia (Huelva), Aragon (Huesca, Zaragoza), Baleares (Mallorca), Catalunia (Lerida, Tarragona), Comunidad Valenciana (Alicante, Valencia) and Navarra, on peach (_P. persica_), nectarine (_P. persica_ var. _nucipersica_), cherry (_P. avium_) and almond (_P. dulcis_).

In all cases, eradication measures have been applied.

[Bacterial spot caused by _Xanthomonas arboricola_ pv. _pruni_ is a serious disease of peach, nectarine, apricot, almond and plum. The pathogen was described for the 1st time on plum in the US in 1903. It was subsequently introduced into Europe where it has been included in the quarantine lists of the European Plant Protection Organisation (EPPO).

Symptoms may include dark spots or watery lesions on fruits and leaves, premature leaf drop, cankers and tip necrosis on young twigs. The disease can severely reduce tree vigour by defoliation and reduces yield and quality of harvested fruit. Infection occurs via leaf scars in autumn and bacteria start to multiply when conditions become favourable.

Bacterial exudate from cankers and lesions is spread by mechanical means (including insect activity) and water. Disease management may include agrochemicals (for example, copper or antibiotic sprays), reduction of available inoculum by orchard sanitation, and use of crop cultivars with resistance, or at least reduced susceptibility, to the disease.

A different pathovar, _Xanthomonas arboricola_ pv. _juglandis_, is considered the most serious disease of commercial walnut plantings. Other species in the genus affect a range of vegetable crops.
