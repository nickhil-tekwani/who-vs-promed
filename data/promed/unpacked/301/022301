Woman ill with dengue fever
---------------------------
The Centre for Health Protection is investigating an imported dengue fever
case involving a 27 year old North Point woman. The woman traveled to
Indonesia from November [2006] to 12 Jan 2007. She came down with fever on
13 Jan 2007 was admitted to Queen Elizabeth Hospital on 16 Jan 2007, and is
now in stable condition. Her family does not have any symptoms. This is the
2nd imported dengue fever case reported in 2007. There were 31 cases, all
imported, in 2006.

Dr Gualberto Pinanez, director general of health surveillance, a unit of
the Ministry of Health, confirmed that there were 140 cases of dengue in
the 1st 2 weeks of 2007. The official recalled that there were nearly 1800
dengue fever cases last year [2006].
He also said that the greatest risk of dengue hemorrhagic fever [DHF] is
the introduction of a [dengue virus] serotype difference from type 3, which
is currently circulating in the country. Infection with a 2nd [dengue
virus] serotype would increase the risk of DHF. The greatest risk is the
arrival of [virus] variants from Brazil, and especially from other South
American countries where other [dengue virus] serotypes are circulating.
Dr Pinanez said that "with certainty, we can say that [dengue virus]
serotype 3 is a benign strain, because we have found that 30 per cent of
the [dengue] cases are secondary [have previously been infected with
another dengue virus serotype - Mod.TY], which is when the greatest risk of
DHF happens, and in this group [of dengue cases], there have not been any
DHF cases."
In 2006, the fundamental difference was that there were no cold
temperatures, and virus circulation continued. He added, "These frequent
rains increase the number of mosquito breeding sites, so it is important
that the public eliminate all water containers that might become breeding
places."

[This report from Paraguay does not imply that dengue virus type 3 is
benign everywhere. It is producing substantial numbers of DHF cases in
Central America.

outbreak in Paraguay. A map of Paraguay can be accessed at:

460 people in Cook Islands affected by dengue fever outbreak
------------------------------------------------------------
About 460 people have so far been affected by a dengue fever outbreak in
the Cook Islands. Dengue fever is transferred by a mosquito, and cases have
been reported in Rarotonga, Arorangi and Tupapa since October 2006.
The director of clinical services, Dr Henry Tikaka, says officials have
adopted a wait and see approach. "It is a cyclical thing. About every 2
years, we have an outbreak of dengue fever, and this one is not different.
We are just going through the process of the outbreak. We actually peaked
in October [2006]; there has been a falling in the number of cases in
December [2006]. In the last couple of weeks, there [has] been an increase
in the number of cases. But we will just wait and see what is in for us in
January [2007]."
Dr Tikaka says a dengue outbreak usually lasts up to 6 months.

[A-Lan Banks is thanked for providing an identical report. A map of the
Cook Islands can be accessed at: <http://www.ck/geog.htm>. WHO describes
dengue fever as a severe, flu-like illness that affects infants, young
children, and adults but is seldom fatal. The clinical features of dengue
fever vary according to the age of the patient. Infants and young children
may have a non-specific febrile illness with rash (although some infants
and very young children may develop shock syndrome, with sudden loss of
circulating fluid volume, and die). Older children and adults may have
either a mild febrile syndrome or the classical incapacitating disease,
with abrupt onset and high fever, severe headache, pain behind the eyes,
muscle and joint pains, and rash.
Dengue hemorrhagic fever is a potentially deadly complication that is
characterized by high fever, hemorrhagic phenomena -- often with
enlargement of the liver -- and in severe cases, circulatory failure. The
illness commonly begins with a sudden rise in temperature accompanied by
facial flush and other non-specific constitutional symptoms of dengue
fever. The fever usually continues for 2 to 7 days and can be as high as
40-41 C (104-105.8 F), possibly with febrile convulsions and hemorrhagic
phenomena. In moderate DHF cases, all signs and symptoms abate after the
fever subsides. In severe cases, the patient's condition may suddenly
deteriorate after a few days of fever; the temperature drops, followed by
signs of circulatory failure, and the patient may rapidly go into a
critical state of shock and die within 12-24 hours or quickly recover
following appropriate volume replacement therapy. There is no specific
treatment for dengue fever. However, careful clinical management by
experienced physicians and nurses frequently saves the lives of DHF
patients. With appropriate intensive supportive therapy, mortality may be
reduced to less than one percent. Maintenance of the circulating fluid
volume is the central feature of DHF case management. (Abstracted from the
