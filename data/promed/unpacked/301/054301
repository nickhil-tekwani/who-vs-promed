A mystery virus that causes an encephalitis-type illness has claimed the
lives of at least five people in Western Australia, doctors say. Dr.
Miles Beaman, head of the infectious diseases department at Fremantle
Hospital, said all known causes had been ruled out in the cases, from the
Perth region.
The five deaths have been over three years but doctors have only recently
put them together and are now seeking assistance from the US Centre for
Disease Control to find a cause. "If we can have two new viruses emerge
over the last three years on the
east coast - equine morbillivirus and lyssavirus - then it's possible we
have one in Western Australia that we haven't known about," Dr Beaman told
AAP.
The patients suffered headaches, cognitive distortion and fever, then
lapsed into a coma. All died within 10 weeks of seeking medical help.
"What twigged us to a possible link was that three of the cases were all
from the south of the river, south of Perth, and as they had not left the
area, it was not something exotic," he said. "It is so far unexplained and
we have stored specimens for later analysis."
After the three cases were presented at an infectious diseases conference
in Hobart, two other doctors came forward with two new unexplained cases.
News of the mystery virus follows the first case on the Australian
mainland of Japanese encephalitis, in March.
Dr Shirley Bowen, an infectious diseases physician at Canberra Hospital
who previously worked in Fremantle, said the deaths were likely to be
caused by an arbovirus not previously known to exist in Australia. "The
illness fits most with one of the arboviral encephaltides that has been
described in South America," Dr Bowen told Australian Doctor newsmagazine.
A spokeswoman for the WA Health Department said the cases were not
considered to represent an outbreak of a new disease.
