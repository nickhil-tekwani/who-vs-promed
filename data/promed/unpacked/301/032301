Scores of dead pigs found in eastern China
-----------------------------------------------
Scores of dead pigs have been found in a river in eastern China, but
the cause of the deaths was unclear, a Hong Kong newspaper said
Tuesday [11 Apr 2006].
The carcasses were found in the neighboring provinces of Jiangsu and
Zhejiang over the last 3 [days], causing health experts to worry that
an outbreak of a disease might be killing the animals, the Apple
Daily said.
Some 161 pigs were found in 2 areas in the Fujiang river in Zhejiang,
the newspaper said. Health authorities in Hangzhou, the provincial
capital, were investigating where the pigs came from and what caused
their deaths, it said.
Officials were also worried the pigs might contaminate the river,
which is a water source for several cities, it said.
Provincial health and government officials telephoned Tuesday [11 Apr
2006] said they were "unclear" about the situation.
The report said dead pigs had been discovered in Zhenjiang, a city in
Jiangsu, since 13 Mar 2006. An agriculture and forestry bureau
official in Zhenjiang said dead swine had been found in the city but
said their carcasses "had been treated properly." He gave only his
surname, Bian, and refused to give any more details.
According to Dr. Noureddin Mona, the Beijing-based representative for
the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization, China's Agriculture
Ministry told his agency it was investigating the report but gave no
details.
A man who answered the telephone at the ministry said he could not
confirm the report and hung up.
In an unusually large and lethal outbreak, _Streptococcus suis_, a
bacteria commonly found in pigs, killed at least 38 people in the
southwestern province of Sichuan and infected more than 200. The
bacteria is usually passed on through contact with raw pork or sick
swine.
Microbiologist Samson Wong of the University of Hong Kong said
Tuesday [11 Apr 2006] both the foot-and-mouth virus and the bacteria
_Streptococcus suis_ can cause pig deaths in large numbers, but that
other diseases [as well as toxic agents. - Mod.AS] are also suspect
[or, rather, deserve to be considered].
He said water polluted with dead pigs would not pose a health risk if boiled.
