Wyoming: Dead Blue Jay Found East of Cheyenne Tests West Nile Virus-positive
------------------------------------------------
Evidence of West Nile virus appeared for the first time in Wyoming
this mosquito season in the form of a dead blue jay found east of
Cheyenne. Terry Creekmore, West Nile Virus Surveillance Coordinator
for the Wyoming Department of Health, said a Cheyenne area resident
saw a blue jay acting ill. The bird then fell dead. The dead bird was
sent to the state for testing and tested positive for the virus,
Creekmore said.
"We know that the _Culex_ mosquito overwintered from last year,"
Creekmore said. An overwintering adult mosquito is the likely source
of infection, he said, since large mosquito hatches have yet to occur
in a cool spring. Blue jays and other members of the family
_Corvidae_ , such as crows, ravens, and magpies, are particularly
vulnerable to the disease. Creekmore expects the _Culex_ mosquitos to
feed on fledgling birds in May. _Culex_ populations peak from late
August through mid-September, he said, which is when _Culex_
mosquitos will feed on large mammals, such as horses and people.
The first big hatchings of mosquitoes in Wyoming are typically
_Aedes_ species, which has not yet been proven to be a carrier of
West Nile virus, Creekmore said. Of 52 mosquito species in Wyoming,
only 4 have been found to transmit the virus, said Dr. Stan Hartman,
Laramie County deputy health officer.
According to Scott Seys, deputy state epidemiologist, public health
programs around the state were being notified that the virus is again
active in Wyoming. Creekmore said he wasn't surprised that Laramie
County was the first to detect West Nile virus this season. "The area
has lower elevation and is further south," he said -- a warmer
environment for mosquitos to either emerge from winter shelter or
hatch in standing water. In 2002, the first year for West Nile virus
in Wyoming, had a short mosquito season, Creekmore said, lasting from
August 16 to late October. This year will have a longer season, from
late May to late October, he said.
West Nile virus is historically found in portions of Africa, the
Middle East, and Central Europe. In 1999, the virus was found in New
York City and has since spread to all but 4 states in the continental
United States. Nationwide, last year 4161 people became ill and 284
people died from the infection. Fewer than 1 percent of the people
infected with the virus become seriously ill. About one third of the
people infected develop flu-like symptoms, while the majority of
people never get sick. 2 non-fatal human cases were reported in
Wyoming in 2002, but the number of human infections will likely
increase as the virus continues to expand throughout the state, said
Creekmore. Last year, the state public health lab tested 90 human
cases with 2 positives; the state veterinary lab tested 342 horses
with 96 positives and 273 birds with 20 positives.

Texas: 3 Birds and One Horse Test West Nile Virus-positive
--------------------------------------------------
Harris County, Texas (Houston area) has 3 West Nile virus-confirmed
birds. The county does its collecting and has the birds tested by Dr.
Tesch at UTMB in Galveston. The birds are: one mourning dove, one
grackle, and one bluejay.
Van Zandt County, Texas (East Texas) has one West Nile virus
confirmed horse, and another awaiting lab results.
This information was supplied by Dr. Ray Parsons, Director, Harris
County Mosquito Control District and Dr. James Wright, Texas Dept. of
Health.

Georgia: First Equine Case of West Nile Virus Infection
-------------------------------------------------------
The state's first case of West Nile virus infection in a horse this
year has been found in Tift County. But one local environmental
official said that the 3 horses found in Berrien County during the
past month with Eastern Equine Encephalitis (EEE) are even more of a
concern.
Stan Coppage, the District Environmental Health Director in Valdosta,
said EEE is much more serious since its effects on human beings are
far worse. "It causes a swelling of the brain and is a lot worse,"
Coppage said. "It's more serious, with a higher fatality rate than
West Nile virus infection. West Nile fever is a milder disease, which
is not to say it won't hurt you."
[EEE is preventable. There are vaccines available for horses. In
areas such as Florida and south Texas, owners are recommended to give
the vaccine at least every 6 months, as the titers tend to drop to
rather low levels by the end of 6 months, and mosquitoes are still
around. Likewise there are fly/mosquito repellents available for
horses. Horses and emus are sensitive indicators of this virus. Emus
may be more sensitive than horses, but as the market has dropped so
much on these birds, we don't have it reported much. However, if the
virus is there in horses, it is in birds as well. Probably the
biggest differential diagnosis based on clinical signs only is West
Nile virus - Mod.TG]

USGS Surveillance Update, as of Wed 4 Jun 2003
-----------------------------------------------
The national and state maps compiled by the USGS reflect information
for the 2003 West Nile virus reporting season that has been submitted
and verified to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
up to Wed 4 Jun 2003.
The surveillance maps posted on <http://westnilemaps.usgs.gov> are
created from data contained in CDC's ArboNET surveillance database.
The maps portray summaries of West Nile virus-positive surveillance
data reported to the CDC by cooperating health departments and
verified to ArboNET. In addition, maps for 2 surveillance categories
(avians and mosquitoes) will portray counties that have done
"testing" of samples for WNV.
Discrepancies noted between these data and data presented from other
sources reflect local variations in reporting policies and
procedures. It is not unusual for cases to be announced in other
media before being reported and verified in ArboNET.
The following information is a synopsis of the results of West Nile
virus surveillance listed according to state. The original USGS maps
further locate both positive and negative surveillance reports by
county. (The data are provisional and may be subject to revision.)
Birds
-----
17 states are conducting surveillance, with 13 states reporting
cumulative positive test results as follows: Alabama (4), Florida
(1), Georgia (9), Illinois (1), Iowa (2), Kentucky (0), Louisiana
(38), Michigan (3), Mississippi (3), New Jersey (1), New York (1),
Oregon (0), Pennsylvania (1), South Carolina (1), South Dakota (0),
Washington (0), Wyoming (1).
Mosquitoes
----------
3 states are conducting surveillance, with 2 states reporting
cumulative positive results as follows: Georgia (2), New Jersey (1),
Pennsylvania (0).
Sentinel Flocks
---------------
2 states are conducting surveillance, both reporting cumulative
positive test results as follows: Florida (34), North Carolina (1).
Veterinary
----------
6 states are conducting surveillance and all 6 are reporting
cumulative positive test results [presumed to be equines] as follows:
Alabama (1), Georgia (1), Kentucky (1), Minnesota (1), Wisconsin (1),
Wyoming (1).
Human
-----
There are no reports of surveillance activity or positive test
results from any state. [A suspected case of human infection in
Washington state (see: West Nile virus, human - USA (Washington):
suspected 20030601.1334) has not been confirmed. - Mod.CP]
