Hundreds of thousands of pigs have been culled by Nigerian farmers in response to an explosion of African swine fever (ASF). The outbreak began around Lagos and parts of neighbouring Ogun state earlier this year [2020], pig farmers say, but has now spread to many other parts of the country.

In the absence of official data [but see OIE report at 20200618.7480740], farmers who spoke to the Guardian estimated that nearly a million pigs had been put down so far. [Mrs B], a farmer at Lagos-based Oke-Aro, the largest pig co-operative in west Africa, said the co-operative alone had culled around 500 000 pigs [see comment]. So far, the virus has spread to more than a quarter of Nigeria's 36 states.

In the past decade, ASF has regularly surfaced in several parts of Africa. Between 2016 and 2019, more than 60 outbreaks were reported across the continent. But the recent wave of infections is the worst by far. "We have never experienced anything of this scale in the past. This is the worst and largest outbreak ever," says [AO], a pig farmer at Oke-Aro, who has lost more than 600 of his 800 pigs.

The farmers who spoke to the Guardian estimated that the pig industry in the country has lost up to NGN 20 billion (about USD 51.6 million), and that more than 20 000 jobs are at risk. The outbreak comes at the same time as coronavirus, which has infected 17 148 people and led to 455 deaths, according to figures released by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control. "A lot of pig farmers may not fully recover from their losses even in the next 2 years. Some farmers have left the industry already. At the moment, we have no clear picture of how the industry is going to bounce back," said [AO].

In recent years, the popularity of pig farming has grown in Nigeria. It is seen as an escape from poverty for low-income households and is also popular with the expanding middle class. By 2009, the pig population had risen from 2 million in 1984 to over 7 million, according to figures from the National Veterinary Research Institute (NVRI). Numbers have probably doubled since then.

The government has taken some action in the crisis, distributing bags of seed and fumigating infected pens. But farmers say this is rarely enough to see them through the rough road to recovery or offset their losses.

ASF is harmless to humans but in pigs and wild boar the fatality rate is nearly 100%, and there is no vaccine against it. Safety depends on controlling animal movement and ensuring hygiene in farms, slaughterhouses and abattoirs. In Nigeria, many farms are not up to the task. "I suspect the outbreak started last year [2019], but the farmers were perhaps selling the infected pigs before it was noticed. This year [2020] the disease exploded," said Dr Pam Luka, ASF researcher at the NVRI. "Activities like this only keep the virus circulating in the country in a cycle."

A further problem comes from poor record-keeping. According to Luka, local authorities rarely have any data for the outbreak. Figures kept by the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), which should be notified of ASF cases, are significantly lower than the numbers quoted by farmers. OIE told the Guardian that they had received a notification about the recent outbreak on Tuesday [16 Jun 2020].

Nigeria currently has no database for issues related to animals and disease outbreaks, says Luka; he is currently working with the government to build one. He is also working with other scientists to understand how the virus is transmitted among pig farms in Africa. But he believes that the situation will only improve when farmers are more proactive and local authorities intensify safety measures and support for the pig industry.

[The Oke-Aro farm is located at Giwa town between the Ogun and Lagos state border. The farm is a source of livelihood to about 3000 farmers. The piggery has an old and a new site. In both sites, a total of 2 million pigs are held.

Around 300 000 pigs have been culled, and nearly all pig pens on the farm have been found infected. In the absence of vaccine against this (non-zoonotic, but fatal for pigs) disease, quarantine and hygiene measures are the remaining feasible actions at hand.

According to a reliable source, the disease started at the new site of the piggery on 28 Feb 2020 and spread to the old site on 1 Mar 2020, killing more than 14 500 pigs (mortality rate of 38.4%) before control measures were applied. Mortality rates as high as 50% to 100% were observed in the affected pens, as most farmers have no pigs left in their pens and they are facing a huge loss of their investment.

The last case of ASF was reported in the same farm in 2008. ASF is considered endemic in Nigeria. In 2019, the disease was reported in the Federal Capital Territory, Kaduna and Plateau states. During the past few months of 2020 (April-June), additional ASF outbreaks also have been reported in other Western African countries, such as Senegal, Burkina Faso and Togo.

According to an epidemiological assessment, Oke-Aro, being the largest piggery in Africa, could be a source of rapid transmission of the disease to other pig farms in Lagos State and other parts of the country, as most pig farmers travel from different parts of the country to purchase pigs. Buyers mostly come from Ogun, Delta, and Abia states and the Republic of Benin.

The public health issue has to be highlighted because the Oke-Aro pig farm settlement land surface is challenged with a huge erosion and geologic uplift that has created several gorges. These gorges are being used as waste dump sites by pig farmers. The pig farmers dump heaps of pig carcasses, manure and other debris into the gorges, contaminating ground water, which is harmful to humans. The whole pig settlement is filthy with heavy air pollution; this poses a severe threat to the pig farmers and the community surrounding the estate. Finally, farmers smuggle dead carcasses for consumption purposes.

The epidemic is having devastating socioeconomic effects on farmers, too.

The Nigerian government has applied several control measures, among them:
- biosecurity measures emphasized;
- movement and purchasing of pigs banned;
- Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (FMARD), in conjunction with Lagos State Ministry of Agriculture (MOA), embarked on a weekly cleaning and decontamination exercise at both old and new site piggeries;
- farmers were requested to dig deep pits for safe disposal of dead pigs.

The state government has distributed food aid to affected farmers in the southwest region. - Mod.AS
