Influenza update number 131
---------------------------
Summary
-------
Worldwide influenza activity is generally low. Influenza activity in
the northern hemisphere temperate regions is continuing to decline or
[fall] back to baseline levels indicating the season is ending. In
countries in the tropical zone, influenza activity is low in most
areas. In southern hemisphere countries influenza activity has not yet
started. Viruses which have been characterized antigenically continue
to be largely related to the lineages found in the current trivalent
seasonal vaccine, except for a small number of influenza B viruses of
the Yamagata lineage.

Countries in the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere
----------------------------------------------------------
North America: Influenza activity continues to decrease in Canada and
the United States of America (USA). In Canada influenza activity has
declined in most of western Canada but persists in parts of Alberta,
Ontario, Quebec, and the Atlantic provinces. The national
influenza-like illness (ILI) consultation rates decreased slightly and
remained below the average rate for this time of year. The number of
influenza related outbreaks and the number of adult and pediatric
hospitalizations with laboratory-confirmed influenza decreased further
this week. While the overall percentage of samples testing positive
for influenza has again decreased from previous weeks to 11.3 percent,
influenza B is increasing proportionately since January 2010 and now
accounts for 44.4 percent of all influenza viruses detected. In the
USA, in epidemiological week 12, the proportion of outpatient
consultations for ILI dropped below the national baseline for the 1st
time since end of December, but the reported deaths due to pneumonia
and influenza from the 122 city surveillance system remained still
above the national baseline. 12 influenza-associated pediatric deaths
were reported, bringing the total for this season to 89. 33 of the 89
deaths reported were associated with influenza B viruses; 21 were
associated with influenza A(H1N1)2009 viruses; 17 deaths reported were
associated with influenza A(H3N2) viruses, and 18 were associated with
an influenza A virus for which the subtype was not determined. Overall
the proportion of samples testing positive for influenza for week 12
decreased further to 14 percent with 71 percent positive for influenza
A and 29 percent positive for influenza B. Among the 301 influenza A
viruses that were subtyped, 62 percent were influenza A(H3N2) viruses
and 38 percent were H1N1 (2009). Of characterized influenza B viruses,
94.3 percent belong to the B/ Victoria lineage, 5.7 percent to the
B/Yamagata lineage. Mexico reported an influenza A outbreak in the
state of Chihuahua, which affected primarily the cities of Juarez and
Chichuahua. Between 22 Mar and 4 Apr 2011, 142 cases of ILI and severe
acute respiratory infection were identified with 24 percent confirmed
to be due to influenza A(H1N1)2009 virus. The confirmed cases included
6 deaths in healthy adults, including one pregnant woman). Genetic
sequencing carried out by the Institute of Diagnosis and
Epidemiological Reference of Mexico on samples from 3 cases showed
that the virus is homologous to the currently circulating viruses. The
outbreak has not been associated with excessive demand on the health
care services. In the rest of Mexico, isolated influenza A(H1N1)2009
cases were reported but no other outbreaks.

Europe: Activity for all influenza indicators in Europe are declining
since the last report. 29 of the 46 reporting countries from the WHO
European Region are now below the baseline for consultation rates for
ILI or acute respiratory illness (ARI). All countries reported either
medium or low influenza activity. In week 12, the proportion of
samples testing positive for influenza among sentinel doctors was 22
percent, a decrease from 46 percent in week 10. H1N1 (2009) is co-
circulating with influenza B with proportional increase of influenza
B. From the influenza positive samples from the sentinel physicians 34
percent were influenza A and 66 percent were influenza B. Among
influenza A the majority (98 percent) were H1N1 (2009). Since week 40,
2010, and similar to North America, nearly all influenza A viruses
characterized this season in Europe have been antigenically similar to
the H1N1 and H3N2 strains included in the current trivalent seasonal
influenza vaccine. Approximately 92 percent of influenza type B
viruses characterized are also of the same lineage as those in the
current vaccine (Victoria) with the remainder being of the Yamagata
lineage.

North Africa and the Middle East: Several countries in North Africa
and Middle East are reporting declining influenza activity. Algeria is
reporting a decrease of confirmed influenza cases in comparison with
last update. Influenza A(H1N1)2009 is now predominating in comparison
with influenza B which was more prevalent in the beginning of the
influenza season. Tunisia is reporting continued but decreasing
circulation of influenza A(H1N1)2009 and influenza B. Oman is
reporting a steady decline in the proportion of outpatient visits for
ILI. In Iran the number of confirmed influenza cases dropped to levels
seen in the beginning of the season with co-circulation of influenza
A(H1N1)2009 and influenza B.

Northern Asia: ILI activity in northern hemisphere countries has been
declining. In northern China ILI activity remained low and below that
observed in the previous 3 seasons. During epidemiological week 12,
only 7 percent of samples tested positive for influenza, majority
(35/44) was influenza B. Japan also reported decreasing ILI activity
with for the last weeks predominantly influenza A(H3N2) detections,
followed by influenza B. And also in the Republic of Korea, ILI
activity remains low. In Mongolia, ILI activity has been sustained
through week 12 but majority of samples tested positive for
respiratory syncitial virus.

Countries in the tropical zone
------------------------------
Influenza activity in the tropics remains low. Most countries in the
Caribbean, Central America and the Andean region reported low
influenza activity and influenza detection rates. In Sub-Saharan
Africa, there is continuous circulation of influenza viruses. In Kenya
and Uganda influenza A(H1N1)2009 and influenza B viruses are
predominating since beginning of this year. Madagascar saw an increase
in influenza activity in the last weeks with influenza A(H3N2) and
influenza B co-circulating. In Ghana and Cameroun influenza
A(H1N1)2009 was the predominant virus detected in last weeks.
Influenza activity in tropical Asia is low and declining. In southern
China for the week 12 the percentage of visits for ILI was below that
observed for the previous 3 seasons. 14 percent of the samples tested
positive for influenza, but the relative proportion of influenza types
was similar to that of northern China with 81 percent influenza B and
19 percent influenza A. In China, Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region in week 12 reports declining ILI activity to baseline levels
and the Center for Health Protection has stated that the influenza
season is over. In Viet Nam, 29 percent of the samples tested were
positive for influenza, lower than last month's rate (38 percent). The
majority was influenza A(H1N1)2009 (88 percent). The Lao People's
Democratic Republic (PDR) and Cambodia reported both very low
activity. In Lao PDR all 21 tested samples were negative for influenza
and in Cambodia 2 of 99 tested specimens were positive for influenza
(both influenza B) Singapore, too is reporting a decline in ARI
activity, which is now below the warning level.

Countries in the temperate zone of the southern hemisphere
----------------------------------------------------------
Influenza activity remains low in most regions in the temperate zone
of the southern hemisphere. Australia continues reporting low activity
of influenza, predominantly influenza A(H3N2) in the northern tropical
areas of the country.

Virological surveillance
------------------------
During weeks 11 to 12, a number of countries reported laboratory
confirmed detections of influenza A(H1N1)2009, A(H3N2) and B viruses.
In the northern hemisphere, influenza activity due to influenza
A(H1N1)2009 and B viruses continued to decease in Asia, most parts of
Europe and the United States of America (USA). In Canada activity
declined in the west but increased influenza B activity was reported
in some eastern areas. Relatively few countries reported influenza
A(H3N2) activity. In the southern hemisphere and most tropical
regions, influenza activity remained low with A(H1N1)2009, A(H3N2) and
B viruses detected in a few countries. An increase in the number of
positive influenza A(H3N2) detections was reported in Australia. The
vast majority of characterized viruses from the 2010-2011 influenza
season remain antigenically similar to the viruses WHO recommended for
the 2010-2011 northern hemisphere influenza vaccines.

FluNet reports
--------------
During weeks 11 to 12 (13 Mar 2011 to 26 Mar 2011), National
Influenza Centres (NICs) from 76 countries, areas or territories
reported data to FluNet*. A total of 7614 specimens were reported as
positive for influenza viruses, 4824 (63.4 percent) were typed as
influenza A and 2790 (36.6 percent) as influenza B. Of the sub-typed
influenza A viruses reported, 67.6 percent were influenza A(H1N1)2009
and 32.4 percent were influenza A(H3N2).
