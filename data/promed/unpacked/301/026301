Animal epidemic spreads to Badakhshan
-------------------------------------------
Nearly 65 percent of the animal livestock in northeastern Badakshan
province have died after contracting a form of mad-cow disease from cattle
exported from Pakistan, said the head of the agriculture and livestock
department, Eng. Mohammad Hassan. The disease has affected mainly animals
in the districts of Shahr-e-Bozurg, Khiwa, Arghanshas and Wardaj.
"This disease, which was 1st discovered in Badakhshan 2 years ago, has been
transmitted from commercial animals from Pakistan and other provinces. We
have many problems with agriculture and farming, and there is only one
veterinary surgeon in Faizabad city with nobody in the districts," he said.
He warned that, if the disease was not controlled, it could spread
throughout Faizabad.
A resident of Shahr-e-Bozurg talked to Pajhwok at the agriculture
department. "I have 800 sheep, out of which, 750 are healthy so far, but 50
have died due to the epidemic," he said. He said there is no veterinary
surgeon in his region to treat the animals.

[Badakhshan province is one of the 34 provinces of Afghanistan, situated in
the northeast, bordering Pakistan on the southeast and Tajikistan on the
north and northeast.
The said newswire is rather ambiguous, describing a "form of mad-cow
disease," allegedly introduced by cattle from Pakistan 2 years ago, which
has been causing mortality of (not less than!) 65 percent in "animal
livestock" (cattle and sheep?) in 4 districts of Badakhashan. One may
assume that (one or more) disease entities, infectious or otherwise, might
prevail in the region, causing (significant?) mortality. Probably, some of
the cases are manifested by nervous symptoms.
In contrast, the reported lack of veterinary support in the area seems to
be unambiguous (room for welcome intervention of VSF (Veterinaires sans
frontiers)?!). Veterinary investigations are required, initially to rule
out highly infectious diseases (such as FMD and rinderpest) as well as
zoonoses. Their results will be appreciated. - Mod.AS]
