Laboratory results received today have confirmed Newcastle disease [NCD] on
a poultry holding in East Lothian.
The results from the Veterinary Laboratories Agency in Weybridge follow
investigation of suspect disease at the holding in Fenton Barns, Drem. [Map

<http://www.multimap.com/map//map/browse.cgi?lat=56.009&lon=-2.7855&scale=100000&icon=x>].
NCD is a disease of poultry. It is not avian influenza and has no
significant implications for public health.
In response to this confirmation the Scottish Executive, Defra and the
State Veterinary Service are undertaking thorough epidemiological
assessments to determine the source of the disease and the level of risk it
may pose to other poultry.
Restrictions have been put in place and poultry on the premises will be
culled in line with EU requirements. A 3km protection zone and a 10km
surveillance zone have been established.
Within the 3km protection zone housing of poultry is required, and
appropriate means of disinfection must be put in place at the entrances and
exits to poultry premises.
Throughout both areas the movements of poultry, captive birds, racing
pigeons and hatching eggs are restricted and may only be moved under
licence. Bird shows and other gatherings are banned. Keepers of poultry in
the areas are being contacted with information on disease and how to
maximise biosecurity protection for their flock.
Background
----------
Newcastle disease is a notifiable disease of birds and is characterised by:
- sneezing, gasping for air, nasal discharge, coughing
- depression, muscular tremors, drooping wings, twisting of head and neck,
circling, complete paralysis
- swelling of the tissues around the eyes and in the neck
- sudden death
- increased death loss in a flock
In laying birds there can be partial to complete drop in egg production;
and production of thin-shelled eggs.
Anyone suspecting disease should report this immediately to the State
Veterinary Service.
Restrictions will be in place for a minimum of 21 days in the Protection
Zone (and 30 days in the Surveillance Zone) after preliminary cleansing and
disinfection of the infected premises have been carried out.
The Scottish Executive Contingency Plan for Newcastle Disease can be found
at <http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2006/09/19105107/0.>
A legal Declaration has been made under the Diseases of Poultry (Scotland)
Order 2003. This and a map showing the areas under restrictions can be
found at:

More than 15 000 birds are to be slaughtered after confirmation of
Newcastle disease on an East Lothian farm.
A 3km protection zone and a 10km surveillance zone are in place around
Fenton Barns, Drem, to prevent the spread of the respiratory disease that
is usually fatal for birds.
The Scottish Executive yesterday emphasised that the disease did not affect
humans and had no link with bird flu. But it can spread rapidly in poultry
of all types, and all birds at Fenton Barns -- understood to include
several thousand reared game birds and a number of exotic species -- will
be culled according to European Union rules.
The last outbreak of Newcastle disease in the UK was in July 2005, when a
flock of pheasants was culled in Surrey. There were also outbreaks in 1997
and 1984.
James Withers, deputy chief executive of the National Farmers Union
Scotland, said: "Newcastle disease is, thankfully, rare in the UK but it
can have a devastating impact on individual farms. The hope is that it
follows a similar pattern to the Surrey outbreak which was contained within
one unit."

[The last outbreak of NCD in the UK was recorded in July 2005. It affected
pheasants in Surrey and was traced back to a farm in Loire Atlantique,
France, wherefrom the pheasants were imported.
It will be interesting to note the possible origin of the current outbreak,
also involving a holding of game birds. - Mod.AS]
