The Ministry of Health and Prevention (MoHaP) has announced 3 new cases of monkeypox, in line with the UAE health authorities' policy on the early detection and monitoring of the disease.

"Monkeypox is a viral disease, but usually a self-limited one, if compared to COVID-19. It's mostly transmitted to humans through close contact with an infected person or animal, including bodily fluids, and respiratory droplets, or with material contaminated with the virus. It can also be passed to the baby in the womb," the Ministry said in a statement.

MoHaP urged all community members to follow appropriate preventive measures and careful precautions while travelling and to stay safer in large crowds and avoid risky behaviours.

It also reassured all community members that the UAE health authorities are taking all necessary measures, including investigation, examination of contacts, and monitoring their health.

Moreover, the Ministry affirmed that it is cooperating with other health authorities in implementing an epidemiological surveillance system, in accordance with the highest global practices, to ensure sustainable efficiency and community protection from communicable diseases, and rapid detection, as well as work to limit the spread of all diseases and viruses, including monkeypox.

"All health authorities in the country are committed to a national unified medical guide for dealing with monkeypox-infected people and their contacts. This includes complete isolation of the infected in hospitals until they recover while quarantining their close contacts for no less than 21 days at home and monitoring their health condition while enforcing their compliance with home isolation."

The Ministry called for obtaining information from official sources in the UAE, and for refraining from spreading rumours and false information, highlighting the importance of staying updated on developments and guidelines issued by the UAE health authorities.

The MoHAP on 24 May 2022, announced the 1st case of monkeypox in the UAE, in line with the UAE health authorities' policy on the early detection and monitoring of the disease.

The ministry explained that the 1st case was detected in a 29-year-old woman who arrived from West Africa, noting that she is receiving the necessary medical care.

MoHAP reassured community members that the UAE health authorities are taking all necessary measures, including investigation, examination of contacts, and monitoring their health.

Some 26 residents of the Netherlands have now tested positive for monkeypox, said the Dutch public health institute RIVM [National Institute for Public Health and the Environment]. The announcement on Monday [30 May 2022] was more than double the total revealed in the last update 5 days earlier, when 12 people were known to be infected with the virus. The 1st case diagnosed in the Netherlands was announced on [20 May 2022].

Although anyone can catch the monkeypox virus, many of those infected in Europe are men who have sexual contact with men. Several of those who tested positive in the Netherlands visited the Darklands Festival, a leather and fetish event in Belgium. The event is inclusive for people of diverse sexualities and genders but mainly focuses on the gay male community.

It is not known how many of the Dutch infections are linked directly to that festival, or how many close contacts of attendees were later infected. The RIVM previously said that infections that occurred at Darklands might not be diagnosed until the end of May [2022], due to the incubation period of the virus.

The GGD will offer the smallpox vaccine to anyone in close contact with someone who tests positive for monkeypox. The jab was given out as part of the normal vaccination course to people born before 1974, according to ANP. It also offers protection against the monkeypox virus.

The number of monkeypox cases rose in Spain over the weekend [28-29 May 2022] by 22 cases to 120, the Spanish health ministry said on Monday [30 May 2022].

On Friday [27 May 2022], health authorities said 98 positive cases of the virus had been confirmed in Spain.

There is usually a spike in figures after the weekend as data is not released on Saturday and Sunday.

In Portugal, health authorities said the tally of cases rose by 22 since Friday [27 May 2022], to 96 on Monday [30 May 2022].

The National Ministry of Public Health reported that "the result of the PCR amplification reaction of the sample taken from the 2nd high-probability case is positive. This confirms infection with poxviruses belonging to the West-African group of the _Orthopoxvirus_ genus. This result is consistent with the observation made by negative staining by transmission electron microscopy, where viral particles of the said viral genus were detected," the Ministry of Health reported in a statement.

Thus, the 2nd case of monkeypox in the country was confirmed. The unit led by Carla Vizzotti said that "it corresponds to a resident in Spain, who is visiting the Province of Buenos Aires and who has no connection with the 1st case."

According to official information, "the person has ulcerative lesions without other associated symptoms, arrived in the country on 25 May [2022] and symptoms began yesterday, 26 May 2022."

Regarding the patient's condition, the health unit assured that "he is in good general condition, isolated, and receiving symptomatic treatment. His close contacts are under strict clinical and epidemiological follow-up, all of them being asymptomatic to date".

The samples for etiological diagnosis were analyzed at the Electron Microscopy Service of the Department of Virology, INEI-ANLIS by Dr Carlos G Malbr√°n.

The newly-discovered cases of monkeypox in the US are growing at a concerning rate and health officials might have found the 1st cases that involve person-to-person contact within our borders.

In the USA, 4 more monkeypox cases have been detected, with one in Colorado being looked at as a "close contact" of another infected person they examined the day before.

Another close contact was found in California, with someone who had been around an infected patient 3 days prior.

Infection cases have risen to 14 people across 8 states and countries around the globe have seen spikes in cases, with the World Health Organization upgrading the crisis threat level to "moderate."

[A map summarizes the timeline of these cases https://imagez.tmz.com/image/9c/4by3/2022/05/30/9ce02d3d273f4b3da4e9a9a843bc0561_md.jpg]

[A 27 May 2022 report indicated that the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment Public Health has confirmed a 2nd presumptive monkeypox case and is awaiting CDC confirmation. The 2nd case is a person who was a close contact of the person who is the 1st presumptive monkeypox case in Colorado (https://denver.cbslocal.com/2022/05/27/colorado-second-presumptive-monkeypox-case/).

Several of these cases acquired their infections while traveling internationally. Individuals who plan to travel abroad should be aware of a 27 May 2022 travel alert level 2 (Practice enhanced precautions) travel advisory issued by the USA CDC. As the COVID-19 situation around the world changes, CDC is monitoring COVID-19 risk in each country and making travel recommendations.

[8] UK: transmission control
Date: Mon 30 May 2022
Source: UK government [abridged, edited]
https://www.gov.uk/government/news/public-health-agencies-issue-monkeypox-guidance-to-control-transmission


UK's 4 public health agencies issue monkeypox guidance to control transmission in the community.

New guidance [https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/principles-for-monkeypox-control-in-the-uk-4-nations-consensus-statement] to support healthcare professionals to respond to the outbreak of monkeypox has been agreed upon by the UK's 4 public health agencies -- UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), Public Health Scotland (PHS), Public Health Wales (PHW), and Public Health Agency Northern Ireland (PHA).

The guidance sets out new measures for healthcare professionals and the public for managing the disease and preventing further transmission now that community transmission is occurring here in the UK and other countries.

People who have possible, probable, or confirmed monkeypox can now isolate at home if they remain well enough, whilst following measures advised in the new guidance to reduce further spread and while being monitored by local health protection teams.

In addition, UKHSA has purchased over 20 000 doses of a safe smallpox vaccine called Imvanex (supplied by Bavarian Nordic) and this is being offered to identified close contacts of those diagnosed with monkeypox to reduce the risk of symptomatic infection and severe illness.

The guidance published today recommends that:
People with possible, probable, or confirmed monkeypox should avoid contact with other people until their lesions have healed and the scabs have dried off. Cases can reduce the risk of transmission by following standard cleaning and disinfection methods and washing their own clothing and bed linen with standard detergents in a washing machine.

Cases should also abstain from sex while symptomatic, including the period of early symptom onset, and while lesions are present. Whilst there is currently no available evidence of monkeypox in genital excretions, as a precaution, cases are advised to use condoms for 8 weeks after infection and this guidance will be updated as evidence emerges.

If people with possible, probable, or confirmed monkeypox infection need to travel to seek healthcare, they should ensure any lesions are covered by cloth and wear a face covering and avoid public transport where possible.

Contacts of someone with monkeypox will also be risk assessed and told to isolate for 21 days if necessary.

Where possible, pregnant healthcare workers and severely immunosuppressed individuals (as outlined in the Green Book [https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/contraindications-and-special-considerations-the-green-book-chapter-6]) should not assess or clinically care for individuals with suspected or confirmed monkeypox. This guidance will be reassessed as evidence emerges.

The minimum recommended personal protective equipment (PPE) for staff working with confirmed cases includes fit tested FFP3 respirators, aprons, eye protection, and gloves. For possible or probable cases minimum recommended PPE for staff includes fluid repellent surgical facemasks (FRSM), gowns, gloves, and eye protection.

Within non-domestic residential settings (for example adult social care, prisons, homeless shelters, refuges), individuals who are clinically well should be managed in a single room with separate toilet facilities where possible. Close contacts of confirmed cases should be assessed for vaccination.

[Additional comments on these recommendations are made by:
- Dr Ruth Milton, Senior Medical Advisor and monkeypox Strategic Response Director, at UKHSA
- Dr Giri Shankar, Director of Health Protection for Public Health Wales
- Dr Nick Phin, Director of Public Health Science and Medical Director, at Public Health Scotland
- Dr Gillian Armstrong, Head of Health Protection at the Public Health
These comments can be accessed at the URL above. - Mod.TY]

The guidance principles highlight the shared scientific understanding across the 4 nations around transmission and biology of the disease - which aligns with the World Health Organisation. The highest risk of transmission is considered to be through direct contact with a confirmed case, droplets, or contaminated surfaces and objects. The highest risk period for transmission is understood to be from the onset of early symptoms until lesions have scabbed over and the scabs have fallen off. There is no current evidence that individuals are infectious before the onset of early symptoms.

UKHSA is working closely with NHS England colleagues to support resilience in the healthcare system over the coming period.

In addition, UKHSA has updated its guidance on offering the Imvanex vaccine to individuals pre and post exposure to a confirmed monkeypox case. The vaccine will be offered pre-exposure to healthcare workers due to care for a patient with confirmed monkeypox and staff working in sexual health services who have been identified as assessing suspected cases. Post exposure, the vaccine will continue to be offered to close contacts in the highest exposure categories, ideally within 4 days of exposure, but it can also be offered to high-risk close contacts, including gay and bisexual men, men who have sex with men, those with immunosuppression, young children and pregnant women, up to 14 days after exposure.

Separately a risk assessment has been carried out by the Human Animal Infections and Risk Surveillance group (HAIRS) looking at household pets. The risk of a case infecting a pet is low. As a precautionary measure, cases should try to avoid contact with their pets, their bedding and litter for 21 days, and where possible pets should be cared for by someone else in the same household. If this is not possible, then infected individuals should minimise their contact with their pet as much as possible, and practise good hygiene by washing their hands thoroughly before and after contact.

[9] Pride parades
Date: Mon 30 May 2022 4:44 PM ET

https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/3506160-pride-parades-should-go-on-despite-monkeypox-concerns-who/


A World Health Organization (WHO) adviser said on Monday [30 May 2022] that people should not change their plans to attend pride parades next month amid the increased circulation of monkeypox.

"It's important that people who want to go out and celebrate gay pride, LGBTQ+ pride, to continue to go and plan to do so," said Andy Seale, a strategies adviser in the WHO Department of Global HIV, Hepatitis and Sexually Transmitted Infections Programmes.

WHO experts have pointed to sex at 2 recent raves in Europe as the leading theory for the spread of the virus, which is endemic in areas of Africa. The agency has said several cases have been reported among men who have sex with men but cautioned it may be a reflection of "positive health seeking behavior" in that demographic, given that the cases were identified at sexual health clinics.

Seale said at Monday's [30 May 2022] public briefing that the organization has linked cases to a number of "social events" in European countries.

"There is no specific transmission route that we need to be worried about," he said. "It really is connected to the fact there have been a couple of events that have perhaps amplified the current outbreak."

WHO released public health guidance [https://www.who.int/news/item/25-05-2022-monkeypox--public-health-advice-for-gay--bisexual-and-other-men-who-have-sex-with-men] on monkeypox last week [25 May 2022] specifically for men who have sex with men. Asked about similarities between the focus on LGBT people in the recent monkeypox outbreak and the HIV epidemic, Seale said WHO has a "lot of lessons learned" from dealing with HIV messaging for years.

"Given this is not a gay disease, the transmission routes are common to everybody," Seale said. "The advice is pretty much the same for all people."

UNAIDS earlier this month [May 2022] denounced monkeypox reporting that included "homophobic and racist stereotyping."

"It's challenging to calibrate this, to balance the risk messaging and not unintentionally contributing to stigma," Seale said.

Seale said close bodily contact is the main risk factor for monkeypox, so condoms will not provide protection. Seale noted that pride parades were not a particular concern because they happen outdoors, while monkeypox has recently been linked to nightclubs and other indoor settings.

"We don't see any real reason to be concerned about enhanced likelihood of transmission in those contexts, because the parties that we've been referring to have perhaps been more in enclosed spaces," he said.

WHO has reported 257 confirmed monkeypox cases and about 120 suspected cases from 23 countries where the virus is not endemic. The international health group said it was not aware of any deaths caused by the virus' increased spread.

[A list of gay pride events scheduled internationally can be accessed at https://www.iglta.org/Events/LGBTQ-Pride-Calendar#pride-calendar. Several of these events have already occurred. Public health authorities are scrambling to raise awareness of the growing monkeypox outbreak in advance of this weekend's start of Pride Month celebrations. In doing so, they are trying to strike a delicate balance -- getting out the message that monkeypox may currently be a risk to men who have sex with men, without stigmatizing the community by linking them to a scary-sounding virus that can infect anyone in certain circumstances. (https://www.statnews.com/2022/05/27/health-officials-scramble-to-raise-monkeypox-awareness-ahead-of-pride-month/).

ref: Haider N, Guitian J, Simons D, et al. Increased outbreaks of monkeypox highlight gaps in actual disease burden in Sub-Saharan Africa and in animal reservoirs. Int J Infect Dis. 2022
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Highlights
----------
- We present explanation for the 2022 monkeypox epidemic in the Western world
- The true burden of MPX and the extent of animal reservoirs are not well known
- The increased rodent-human interaction led to increased transmission of MPXV
- The population has crossed a threshold for sustainable human-human transmission
- A new estimation of basic and effective reproduction rate (R0 and Re) is required

Abstract
--------
Perspective
We explain research gaps on monkeypox (MPX) virus epidemiology in endemic countries and present hypotheses for the recent increase of MPX cases in West Africa as a possible explanation for the current epidemic in Europe, America, and Australia. The detection of >270 MPX cases in less than a month in May 2022, across many countries, underscores the epidemic potential of MPX in humans and demonstrates several important research gaps. First, the true burden of MPX in West and Central Africa is poorly understood, although it is critical for the prevention and control of future outbreaks. 2nd, the diversity and extent of the animal reservoir remain unknown. We hypothesize that the synanthropic rodent population has increased in recent years in Africa leading to more human-rodent interactions and thus increased transmission of MPXV. We further hypothesise that nearly 45 years after the end of routine smallpox vaccination, the larger and more interconnected immune-na√Øve population has crossed a threshold resulting in more sustainable human-to-human transmission of MPXV. The current epidemic in the Western World is possibly a consequence of increased local transmission of MPXV in Africa. A new estimation of the basic and effective reproduction rate (R0 and Re) in different populations is required. National, regional, and international collaborations are needed to address research gaps related to MPX outbreaks.

[These research gaps are a basis for research in West Africa. As an alternative to rodent population increases, it is possible that the expanding human population is moving into areas where rodents are already abundant, increasing human-rodent contact. Some rodent populations may be declining. The pouched rat (_Cricetomys_ spp) a suspected host of monkeypox virus, is a popular bush meat item and 30 years ago had been hunted to extinction in parts of DR Congo. It is unknown if it has become re-established in any of those areas. - Mod.TY]
