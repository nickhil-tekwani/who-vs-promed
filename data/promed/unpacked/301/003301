Egypt mumps outbreak more than triples in one week
--------------------------------------------------
An outbreak of the viral infection, mumps, has spread through schools nationwide in Egypt, according to an Egypt Independent report on Mon 8 Oct 2012. The number of cases reported as of Monday [8 Oct 2012] is 583; this is up from 157 cases reported just one week earlier.

Despite the surge in mumps cases, a spokesman for the Education Ministry said that no schools have been closed due to the outbreak.

According to the report, Giza Governorate has so far reported the most number of cases, with 240. Minya has reported 95, Beni Suef 48, and Fayoum 38, with Cairo reporting only 12.

Last week, Health Ministry undersecretary Amr Qandil projected rising numbers of mumps cases this winter season, but assured it would not be a public health emergency.

Mumps is also an acute viral disease that is characterized by fever and swelling and tenderness in one or more of the salivary glands. Maximum infectiousness occurs between 2 days prior to onset of illness to 4 days afterwards. It is spread from person-to-person by respiratory droplets (for example, when you sneeze) or by direct contact with items that have been contaminated with infected saliva.

Complications to mumps may include: orchitis (which has been reported to be a risk factor for testicular cancer), encephalitis and spontaneous abortion. Sterility in males is a rare possible outcome.

Mumps can be prevented with vaccination. Two doses of mumps vaccine are 88 per cent (range: 66-95 per cent) effective at preventing the disease; one dose is 78 per cent (range: 49-92 per cent) effective.

[Just 7 days ago more than 100 cases of mumps were reported in Qena governorate. Now 583 cases have been reported from 5 other governorates. Giza Governorate has so far reported the most case with 240, followed by Minya with 95, Beni Suef with 48, Fayoum with 38, and Cairo with only 12.

Previously the outbreak in Qena governate was attributed to an interruption in the supply of MMR vaccine. It would seem that the vaccine shortage extends country-wide. If so, a corresponding increase in the prevalence of measles virus infection would be expected also.
