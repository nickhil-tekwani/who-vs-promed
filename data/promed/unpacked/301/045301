Health authorities at Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC) on [Tue 6 Aug 2019] said one more person had been diagnosed with the [Crimean-Congo] hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) and admitted to an isolation ward in the health facility, and advised people to take precautionary measures while interacting with cattle and sacrificial animals.

"A 29-year-old patient was brought to the JPMC Emergency Department with high-grade fever and bleeding from the gums. Doctors suspected a case of Congo fever and, after the medical tests, the patient tested positive for CCHF. He has been admitted to an isolation ward for appropriate treatment," said Dr Seemin Jamali, the executive director of the JPMC, while talking to The News.

She said it was the 9th CCHF patient to have been brought to the JPMC. Two died during treatment, one took leave against medical advice (LAMA), and 5 of the patients recovered and were discharged from the hospital.

CCHF is a lethal viral infection that is transmitted to humans from animals, especially cattle and livestock. Patients are kept in isolation wards to prevent other patients, doctors, and paramedics from contracting the viral infection.

The virus claimed the life of a 27-year-old man, who succumbed to the complications of the tick-borne viral disease at a private hospital last month [July 2019].

In view of the extensive movement of sacrificial animals in the country ahead of Eidul Azha, the National Institute of Health (NIH) has issued an advisory calling for different stakeholders, including individuals and animal healthcare authorities, to take timely steps for the prevention and control of the Congo virus during the next few months.
