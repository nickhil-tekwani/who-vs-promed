Horses at the Los Angeles Equestrian Center in Burbank were placed under quarantine after an outbreak of a deadly virus, ABC7 has learned.

The California Department of Food and Agriculture reported an outbreak of myeloencephalopathy, also known as equine herpes virus. The virus attacks a horse's nervous system and can be debilitating and even deadly.

A sick 5-year-old saddlebred displaying severe neurological symptoms was euthanized on Wednesday [2 Nov 2016], according to the CDFA.

"It was clinical with neurological signs," Dr. Katie Flynn with the California Department of Food and Agriculture explained. "That one initial horse went downhill pretty quickly and was euthanized due to the severity of the signs."

A 10-year-old saddlebred was also diagnosed, the CDFA stated.

Officials said 2 horses were at a show in Las Vegas on 27 Oct 2016 and returned to the Los Angeles Equestrian Center on Sunday [30 Oct 2016].

"Equine herpes virus is a common disease. It is a condition that in some of these horses they can go neurologic," Flynn said.

While the virus is common, equine health experts said that it was rare that horses died from myeloencephalopathy. "It's extremely rare that we lose horses from this viral infection," equine veterinarian Dave Wheat said.

The CDFA issued a quarantine for dozens of horses in hopes of containing the outbreak. The virus is not transmittable to humans, according to officials.

To help prevent the spread of myeloencephalopathy, the CDFA recommended owners to limit horse-to-horse contact, communal water troughs, and sharing horse equipment without cleaning it 1st.

[Equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy [EHM] is an infrequent but serious neurological complication of equine herpesvirus 1 (EHV-1) infection. Infection with EHV-1 is listed by the OIE. EHV-1 and EHV-4 are endemic in many domestic equine populations worldwide.

For background and detailed information on the equine infections caused by the 2 closely related herpesviruses EHV-1 and EHV-4, please go to OIE's terrestrial manual, chapter 2.5.9. at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.05.09_EQUINE_RHINO.pdf.
