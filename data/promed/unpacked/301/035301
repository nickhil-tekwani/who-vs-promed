River water is believed to be the source of the hepatitis A outbreak
that has infected 800 people in three villages in Hulu Terengganu
district [Terengganu state].

This followed cost saving measures by Kampung [village] Basung,
Kampung Pasir Dula, and Padang Setebu villagers who have been using
Sungai Kecur [stream] as their water source since 1980. They only pay
RM24 [about USD 8] annually for maintenance of drainage and the
watershed area managed by village security development committees
(JKKK) compared to RM30 [about USD 10] monthly charged by Syarikat Air
Terengganu Sdn Bhd (Satu) [city water company]. Kampung Basung JKKK
chairman Mamat Mat Amin said the initiative taken by the villagers was
to cut costs because most of them are farmers. "We have to use the
river water to reduce costs but stallholders are spared as they use
clean water supplied by Satu," he told reporters here [in Hulu
Terengganu] today [15 Nov 2011].

However, Mamat said that people in the 3 villages have never been hit
by a hepatitis A outbreak. Kampung Basung, Kampung Pasir Dula, and
Padang Setebu were declared hepatitis A infected areas after 42 people
were admitted to Hulu Terengganu Hospital. State Health, Unity and
Consumer Affairs Committee Chairman Dr A Rahman Mokhtar yesterday [14
Nov 2011] said they were not quarantined and thus accessible to
anyone.

Of the 42 people infected, 27 were from Kampung Basung, 14 from
Kampung Pasir Dula, and 1 from Kampung Padang Setebu. However, 9
people were discharged from hospital today [15 Nov 2011] while 33 were
undergoing treatment. A check by Bernama found that the state health
department has put chlorine in the water source to [destroy] the
virus.

[Hepatitis A is a viral liver disease that can cause mild to severe
illness. It is spread by faecal-oral transmission when a person
ingests food or drink contaminated by an infected person's faeces. The
disease is closely associated with poor sanitation and a lack of
personal hygiene. Blood borne transmission of hepatitis A virus
infection occurs but is much less common. Waterborne outbreaks, though
infrequent, are usually associated with sewage-contaminated or
inadequately treated water. Casual contact among people does not
spread the virus.

Cost-cutting measures in relation to the supply of clean water to
these villages in Hulu Terengganu appear to have been responsible for
this extensive outbreak of hepatitis A virus infection. No doubt the
problem will be resolved locally at an administrative level and by
provision of adequate funding. Chlorine treatment is not the final
solution.
