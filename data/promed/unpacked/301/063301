Brucellosis revealed in humans and animals in the Khachmazskiy district
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Brucellosis has been revealed in the village Niyazabad in the Khachmazskiy
district in cattle and small ruminants; 14 inhabitants of the village have
been infected.

Mugeddes Takhaev, deputy chief physician of the outpatient department in
the village of Niyazabad, has stated that the disease was first detected on
15 Mar 2008 in 4 persons. Further investigations, carried out on 8 May
2008, have led to the discovery of 10 additional patients.

The human patients have been treated. Animals had not been vaccinated, said
Takhaev [see comment].

[According to Azerbaijan's annual report to the OIE (2007), _Brucella
melitensis_ and B. abortus_ are endemic in the local animals (cattle,
sheep, and goats). The control measures include targeted surveillance and
stamping out; reportedly, no vaccinations have been applied against either
of the above agents, in the respective target animal populations. It would
be interesting to note how many animals have been found infected in the
village Niyazabad, their species, the agent identified (_B. abortus_ and/or
_B. melitensis_), and how many of the said animals have been slaughtered
according to the official stamping out policy. - Mod.AS]

Quarantine imposed in an Altai village
--------------------------------------
A total of 116 sheep and 12 goats have been identified as infected by
brucellosis in the village Kuchuk of Altai krai. The cases have been
confirmed by laboratory tests. The press service of the regional department
of the Ministry of emergency situations informed about it to the
correspondent of IA Regnum on 14 May 2008.

Currently, the sick animals are isolated. All the yards are equipped with
disinfection entry areas and the population is informed about the
restrictions due to brucellosis. It is expected that these measures would
not allow further spread of infection. Local veterinarians are working in
the village.

[It is alarming that the cases are among sheep and goats. The agent of
brucellosis among them often is _B. melitensis_, which is the most
pathogenic strain for humans, causes outbreaks, and severe forms of
disease. - Corr.BA

This is already the 2nd report about animal brucellosis in Altai krai in
the past month. It indicates that the epizootic situation is not favorable
in this region. Meanwhile, this region had 30 years of brucellosis-free
history. The reasons for the current emergency are connected with
violations of veterinary-sanitary rules -- such as, import of animals
without veterinary assessment, lack of quarantine measures for imported
animals, or limited veterinary control over the levels of vaccine coverage.
