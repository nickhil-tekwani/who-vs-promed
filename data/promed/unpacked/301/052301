Rise in human infections from _Campylobacter_ and _E. coli_, whilst _Salmonella_ cases continue to fall: EFSA and ECDC 2011 zoonoses report
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Campylobacteriosis remains the most reported zoonotic disease in humans [in Europe], with a continuous increase in reported cases over the last 5 years. The trend in reported human cases of enterohemorrhagic _Escherichia coli_ (EHEC) has also been increasing since 2008 and was further strengthened due to the outbreak in the summer of 2011. Salmonellosis cases in humans have continued to fall, marking a decrease for the 7th consecutive year. These are some of the main findings of the annual report on zoonoses and foodborne outbreaks in the European Union for 2011 produced jointly by the European Food Safety Authority and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC).

The report supports the European Commission and EU Member States in monitoring risks related to zoonotic diseases. These diseases can be transmitted directly or indirectly between animals and humans, for instance by consuming contaminated foodstuffs or through contact with infected animals.

"The good news is that the positive trend in reduction of salmonellosis in humans and poultry is continuing. However, the increase in _Campylobacter_ and EHEC cases highlights the continued need to monitor and control the presence of these bacteria in the food chain in order to reduce the risk of human exposure," said Pia Makela, Head of EFSA's Biological Monitoring Unit.

Johan Giesecke, Chief Scientist at ECDC, added: "We need to remain vigilant and continue to strengthen our collaboration with all important partners involved in the prevention and control of zoonotic diseases. Although the results of the report show a sustained decrease in salmonellosis cases in humans, _Campylobacter_, and EHEC cases are still increasing. We can't lower our guard."

In 2011, a total of 220 209 _Campylobacter_ cases were reported in humans, 2.2 percent more than in 2010. This bacterium can cause diarrhea and fever, and the most common foodstuff in which _Campylobacter_ was found was chicken meat.

EHEC bacteria accounted for 9485 human disease cases in 2011. The strong increase observed in 2011 was primarily due to the large outbreak of the rare strain O104:H4 in Germany and France associated with sprouted seeds; however, an increasing trend had already been reported in previous years. Infection with EHEC strains can lead to bloody diarrhea and haemolytic uremic syndrome, a serious complication that can be fatal. With respect to the presence of this bacterium in animals and foodstuffs, EHEC was most often reported in bovine meat products and cattle. [The chimeric O104:H4 strain is not clearly zoonotic - Mod.LL]

Although salmonellosis has declined significantly in the last years, in 2011 it was still the 2nd most frequently reported zoonotic disease in humans, accounting for 95 548 reported cases. The continued decrease in human cases reflects the results of the _Salmonella_ control programs put in place by EU Member States and the European Commission which have led to a decline in salmonellosis in poultry populations, particularly laying hens (and hence eggs) and chickens. _Salmonella_, which can cause fever, diarrhea and abdominal cramps, was most often found in fresh chicken meat, as well as minced chicken meat and chicken meat preparations.

The report also shows a total of 5648 foodborne outbreaks recorded across the EU in 2011. Foodborne outbreaks include 2 or more human cases in which the same contaminated food has been consumed. These affected 69 553 people and caused 93 deaths. _Salmonella_ continued to be the most frequently reported cause of the outbreaks with known origin (26.6 percent of all outbreaks), followed by bacterial toxins (12.9 percent), and _Campylobacter_ (10.6 percent). Even though _Campylobacter_ is the most often reported cause of zoonotic diseases overall, it is less often reported as a cause of foodborne outbreaks. The most common food sources of the outbreaks were eggs and egg products, mixed food, fish, and fish products.

The report covers 10 zoonotic diseases in total, including also listeriosis, echinococcosis, yersiniosis, brucellosis, tuberculosis due to _Mycobacterium bovis_, trichinellosis, and rabies. It supports the European Commission and EU Member States in monitoring and reducing risks related to zoonotic diseases.

The disease alveolar echinococcosis in man, which is caused by the larval form of _Echinococcus multilocularis_ parasite, has increased in humans over the last 5 years. In several central European countries, this parasite was commonly reported in foxes, which are the main source of human infection. Echinococcosis is a serious disease which develops gradually over several years and, if untreated, may be fatal.
