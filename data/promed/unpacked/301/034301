1st report of _Alternaria tenuissima_ causing leaf spot and fruit rot on
eggplant (_Solanum melongena_) in India
-------------------------------------------------------
P Raja <peraja2001@yahoo.co.in >, AV Ramana Reddy, US Allam, Department of
Plant Pathology, Agricultural College, Bapatla-522 10, Andhra Pradesh,
India. Accepted for publication 11 Oct 2005.
A leaf spot disease of eggplant (_Solanum melongena_) was observed during
1997-2000 in Guntur district Andhra Pradesh, India. The symptoms recorded
were small, circular, brown necrotic spots all over the foliage. The spots
gradually enlarged in size and later became irregular in shape or remained
circular with concentric rings or zones. In the later stage of infection,
these spots coalesced, resulting in withering, extensive drying and leaf
shedding. On fruit, the symptoms started as small concentric dark brown
sunken spots, which coalesced and covered the entire surface of the fruit.
Affected fruit rotted completely, causing severe yield losses.
The causal agent of this disease was successfully isolated on potato
dextrose agar (PDA) from diseased leaves and fruits. After 4 to 5 days of
incubation at 26 C with a 12 hour photoperiod, the fungus produced colonies
which were regular and flat, with a rough upper surface. The periphery of
the colony was olive-green, with a black center and dull white spots. The
growth of the fungus was smooth. The conidiophores were short, arising
singly, measuring 81.6 to 163.2 mm in length and were 4.08 to 8.16 mm
thick. The size of the conidia varied from 26 to 48.75 mm in length and
9.75 to 16.27 mm in width, with an average beak length of 9.58 mm.
Horizontal and vertical septations of conidia varied from 1 to 6 and 0 to
2, respectively.
On the basis of the morphological characteristics of the conidiophores and
conidia, the pathogen was identified as _Alternaria tenuissima_. The
culture was sent to the Indian type culture collection, located at the
Indian Agricultural Research Institute in New Delhi, where its identity was
confirmed.
Pathogenicity tests were conducted on 60 day old eggplants (cv. Bapatla
Local) by spraying with a spore suspension (500 000 spores per ml) using an
atomizer in the late evening. Inoculated plants were covered with a
polythene bag and incubated at 26 C with a 14 hour photoperiod. 30 days
after inoculation, the symptoms were similar to those previously observed.
The fungus was consistently re-isolated from the inoculated plants. At the
same time, control leaves, sprayed with distilled water, did not develop
any symptoms. _A. tenuissima_ is a cosmopolitan fungus already identified
in India on several hosts - for example, taro _Colocasia esculenta_, pigeon
pea _Cajanus cajan_, and _Ipomoea carnea_.
This is the 1st record of _A. tenuissima_ on eggplant in India.

[The is the 1st report of this disease in India. The interval between
completion of the work and its submission seems inordinately long, but I am
overlooking that because the piece involves a 1st report of the disease,
which is worthy of record.
