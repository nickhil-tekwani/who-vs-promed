Bird flu suspect treated in Sanglah hospital, Bali
--------------------------------------------------
A 15-year-old female resident of Pulesari Kecamatan Tembuku, Bangli,
was rushed to Sanglah hospital, on Wednesday evening [5 Aug 2009]
after several chickens belonging to her family were found suddenly to
have died. According to the information, the victim had contact with
the dead chickens when burying them. She developed fever and flu
symptoms after that. Worrying about the girl's condition, the
patient's parent took her to Sanglah hospital.

On Thu 6 Aug 2009, the Health Service and Livestock Service officers
of Bangli investigated the victim's surroundings and found positive
H5N1 in the dead chickens using a rapid test. Subsequent to this
finding, the Livestock Service culled all remaining chickens
belonging to victim's family.

[As previously indicated, according to the WHO Timeline
(<http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/Timeline090727.pdf>)
there has been no confirmed case of avian influenza (H5N1) virus
infection in Indonesia since the beginning of 2009.

There have been many tens of suspected cases reported in local
Indonesia newspapers, but so far none has been confirmed. The present
report is a translation from a local newspaper -- the Bali Post. Time
will tell whether this report is any more accurate than the others
reported in local newspapers.
