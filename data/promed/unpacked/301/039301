As many as 9 dengue cases (including one death) and 56 malaria cases were
reported in Pune district during the first 5 months of 2005.
This was disclosed by V H Mohite, assistant director, malaria and filaria
control, and S V Patil, district malaria officer, while addressing a news
conference on the occasion of anti-malaria month here on Wednesday.
Mohite stated that out of the 9 dengue cases, 4 were reported in Baramati,
3 in Pimpri Chinchwad (including one death) [the case fatality rate or CFR
is 1111 per 10 000 - Mod.RY] and one each in Purandar and Maval. He stated
that since 2001 there has been a steady decline in malaria cases in the
district, and only 211 cases were detected in 2004 as compared to 736 in
2001. However, incidents of dengue have increased with 83 cases found in
2004 as compared to 29 in 2002 when dengue was detected in the district.
Speaking about the preventive measures taken by the health department, S V
Patil said that door-to-door inspection was conducted in every village and
patients were given medicines on the spot. 35 malaria clinics and 3140
tablet distribution centres are operational in the district. As many as 42
laboratories in the district are equipped to test blood samples collected
by the health workers.
Starting this year [2005], the malaria control office has decided to spray
insecticides in villages only if there is an outbreak of malaria. "The
decision was taken to avoid unnecessary use of pesticides and prevent
pesticide resistance among mosquitoes", he explained.
He said that emphasis was also given to biological measures, especially the
use of guppy fish that eat mosquito larva. As many as 390 guppy fisheries
have been set up in rural areas in Pune and another 247 in urban areas.
Patil stated that medicated mosquito nets were distributed for free in 10
villages under a joint scheme of the state and union governments.
Patil stated that a special anti-malaria drive is being implemented in the
month of June all over the state so that precautionary measures were
undertaken before start of monsoon and the awareness level was high.

Australian quarantine authorities are on alert after a [type of] mosquito
which could potentially spread dengue fever to new parts of the country was
detected in the Torres Strait. The Asian Tiger mosquito is common in
Southeast Asia and Papua New Guinea and has been found on 10 islands in the
Strait, situated off Australia's northeastern coast.
The Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service is now monitoring traffic
to Thursday and Horn Islands, which are the region's transport hubs.
Entomologist James Walker says the mosquito can carry a number of diseases
so it is important it doesn't spread.
"Asian tiger mosquito has the biological capacity to live in much cooler
climates than some of the other dengue-carrying mosquitoes," he said. "So,
potentially it could survive in parts of Australia where previously we
haven't had a mosquito that can vector dengue fever."

The popular tourist destination of Costa Rica has seen a sharp uptick in
dengue fever, a mosquito-borne disease that can be deadly, Costa Rica's
health minister warned.
More than 4400 cases have been reported since the start of the year, a
spike of 51 percent over 2004.
At least half of the cases were contracted on the Caribbean coast of the
small Central American country.
According to the World Health Organization, between 50 and 100 million
people are infected around the world each year with dengue fever. Dengue
hemorrhagic fever, the most serious [form] of the disease, kills 20 000
people annually.
There is no known cure or vaccine for dengue fever, characterized by high
fevers, headaches and muscle pain.
Once limited to Southeast Asia, dengue hemorrhagic fever has spread to
Indian Ocean nations, the South Pacific and Latin America.
Unchecked urbanization, lack of mosquito control programs, natural
disasters and poverty exacerbate the spread of the disease.

Dengue fever kills 10 in Yemen
----------------------------------------
Dengue fever has killed 10 and infected 345 people in Yemen, according to a
confidential report.
Sources at the public health office in Shabwa province said 6 deaths were
reported from the Bayhan area and 4 from Radhoom until May 29.
However, the Shabwa local authorities declined to comment on the number of
deaths and whether they are dengue fever cases for sure or not.
Last week, authorities in Shabwa discussed measures to control the spread
of the disease.
The meeting approved the setting up of facilities for following up and
registering the cases in the 5 affected areas in the eastern provinces.
Earlier this year, hundreds of people were infected by the disease in the
coastal province of Hodeida [see ref:20050310.0709. - Mod.RY]

[The case fatality rate (CFR) for dengue fever in the report from Yemen in
2005 is approximately 290 per 10 000. The cumulative 9 cases of dengue
fever in India is rather small, but the fatality rate is about 1111 per 10
000. For the same period, Sri Lanka has a CFR of 42.7. The CFR values (per
10 000) vary dramatically: 4.5 for Viet Nam, 20 for Thailand, and 320 for
Philippines. The above figures are derived from the current reports and the
previous update: 20050612.1635. - Mod.RY]
