SHEATH BLIGHT, RICE - USA (MISSISSIPPI)

Temperatures in the mid-80s and low 90s [29 to 34 deg C], along with
high humidity have created the right conditions for sheath blight,
says Nathan Bruehling, Mississippi State University Extension rice
specialist.
Sheath blight is especially aggressive with cultivar 'CL-161'. "We
have more consistently seen a yield increase and economic return when
applying fungicide to this variety," Bruehling says.
'Cocodrie' is rated susceptible to sheath blight. "If sheath blight
can easily be found in the field and it has moved 4 to 6 inches [10
to 15 cm] up the plant, I would consider making a fungicide
application," Bruehling says. 'Wells' is rated moderately susceptible
to sheath blight. "I would scout and monitor for sheath blight to
make sure it is not aggressively moving up the plant," Bruehling
says. 'Hybrid' is rated moderately susceptible to sheath blight. "I
would monitor and manage these hybrids similar to Wells," he says.

[Sheath blight on rice is caused by the fungus _Rhizoctonia solani_
(current name _Thanatephorus cucumeris_.) It causes lesions on
sheaths of leaves near the water line during the late tillering or
early internode elongation growth stages. Lesions expand and
infection spreads rapidly in the field by runner hyphae or
plant-to-plant contact. Yield losses (up to 50 percent in highly
susceptible cultivars) result from poorly filled grain heads and from
reduced plant vigour. Fungal sclerotia survive for long periods in
the soil and float to the surface of flooded rice fields causing
infection in the next crop. The fungus can also attack a number of
weed hosts, which can serve as reservoirs.
No reliable source of genetic host resistance has been identified so
far, despite the large number of lines and varieties screened. No
totally resistant variety, but many with moderate resistance have
been found. Related wild rices have failed to provide sources of
higher levels of resistance than those found in cultivated species.
New high yielding, susceptible rice varieties requiring high soil
levels of nitrogen contribute to an increase in sheath blight.
Nitrogen increases the susceptibility of plants further. Disease
management includes the use of less susceptible varieties, avoiding
close spacing of plants and excessive nitrogen applications, control
of grass and weed hosts, long-term rotations with non- host crops,
and foliar fungicides.
_T. cucumeris_ (_R. solani_) is a ubiquitous soilborne fungus, which
causes damping-off, root rot, basal stem root (foot rot), and fruit
rot in a large number of crops including citrus and other fruit tree
species, cruciferous and solanaceous vegetables, legumes, cucurbits,
peanut, soybean, canola, lettuce, and a number of cereals. It is also
the causal pathogen of rhizoctonia root rot of wheat (see ProMED-mail
post of 17 Jul 2007, no. 20070717.2291).
