Multiplex detection of criniviruses associated with epidemics of a yellowing
disease of tomato in Greece. Plant Dis. 86:1345-1349.

Since 1997, a yellowing disease has been observed in greenhouse tomato
(_Lycopersicon esculentum_). By 2001, the disease was widespread, including
pen field tomato crops, and in most cases its incidence was 80 to 100
percent. Epidemics in glasshouses were mainly associated with high
populations of _Trialeurodes vaporariorum_ & _Bemisia tabaci_, the major
whitefly pests in vegetable crops in Greece.
The main leaf symptoms were severe yellowing, rolling and brittleness.
Samples from symptomatic plants were analyzed by PCR and shown to be
infected with Tomato infectious chlorosis virus (TICV) and Tomato chlorosis
virus (ToCV) (family Closteroviridae, genus Crinivirus). TICV was found in
164 of 183 symptomatic samples, but ToCV was less representative (25/183).
Sequence comparisons of the amplified 229-bp and 466-bp products revealed 99
& 100 percent identity with the reported sequences of TICV and ToCV,
respectively. An RT multiplex PCR assay using a simple sample preparation
procedure was developed to allow rapid, specific, and simultaneous detection
of both ToCV and TICV sequences in 2 steps. The method involves a 1-tube
RT-PCR step in which the combination of primers amplifies part of the heat
shock protein to [the] homologue gene of both ToCV and TICV, followed by a
multiplex nested PCR amplification.
This is the first report of TICV and ToCV in Greece and, as far as we know,
the first report of TICV in Europe.

[Criniviruses are an emerging group of plant viruses that infect cucurbits,
lettuce, tomato & sweet potato, and perhaps other crops monitored by
ProMED-Plant. A contributing factor to the increased incidence of crinivirus
diseases is the rapid increase in whiteflies (_B. tabaci_ and _B.
argentifolii_) and greenhouse whitefly (_Trialeurodes vaporariorum_) in
temperate regions in the last 2 decades. In addition to TICV and ToCV, there
are 4 other criniviruses (Cucurbit yellow stunting disorder, CYSDV), Lettuce
chlorosis (LCV), Lettuce infectious yellows (LIYV), & sweet potato chlorotic
stunt (SPCSV). The natural host range of Abutilon yellows virus is
restricted to Abutilon spp.
Criniviruses are known to be present in the USA, Europe, & the Middle-East,
and SPCSV is found worldwide in temperate-tropical regions. These viruses
induce yellowing symptoms, are usually phloem-limited and are not
transmissible mechanically.
