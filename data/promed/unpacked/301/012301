region. Sick children have been admitted to hospitals in Gluzsk and Bobruisk.
The outbreak began on 21 Jul 2005. 2 children aged 4 and 5 years have
died; another child is in critical condition.
Altogether, 180 children from 4 to 18 years of age, with mental and
physical disorders, live in the children's home in the village of Vesnovo.

[It is not stated in the posting which serotype of _N. meningitidis_ was
involved in this outbreak and whether vaccination was used with the
presumed chemoprophylaxis. A new protein-conjugated quadrivalent
meningococcal vaccine has recently been licensed in the USA and is likely
to become part of future universal immunization programs. - Mod.LL]
