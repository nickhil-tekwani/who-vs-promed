An outbreak of dengue fever is occurring in Cambodia's Kompong
Chhnang province, about 90 km north of the capital, with more than 30
people sickened so far, local media reported on Friday.
At least 30 children were hospitalized in the province's Boribor
district on Wednesday and some have been taken by ambulance to the
hospital for blood testing, Chhuon Buntha, chief of the district's
health office, was quoted by The Cambodia Daily as saying. "It's like
a storm of dengue fever. Children have fallen sick everywhere in the
district," he said.
The outbreak of the fever, which is carried by mosquitoes, was first
noticed early this month but has worsened following intermittent
rains, he said. There have been no reported deaths so far. There were
only 30 cases, according to Ngan Chan Tha, director of the Health
Ministry's dengue control program.
Insecticide will be sprayed throughout the district in an effort to
combat the outbreak. The coming rainy season could be cause for
concern, he warned. Local residents are advised to be certain that
pools of still water do not collect around their homes as this could
attract mosquitoes.

Dengue fever infections appear to be on the rise in Thailand in 2006,
with at least 8 persons [died] so far, according to the Ministry of
Public Health. Figures from January to mid-April show 4971 Thais
nationwide have been infected with the disease and that 8 reportedly
died, 3 in the southern province of Nakhon Si Thammarat, 2 in Bangkok
and one each in Phichit, Nakhon Nayok, and Pattani, according to the
head of Thailand's Disease Control Department, Dr. Thawat Suntrajarn.
Dengue fever, an infection which is spread by the bite of infected
mosquitoes, is common in Thailand, especially during the rainy
season, which is about to begin. Meanwhile, caretaker Public Health
Minister Pinij Jarusombat said although the rainy season has yet to
arrive in most of Thailand, the current figures show that dengue
fever infection rates in the country began to soar since early 2006.
The main factor could be that the disease is peaking, that it has
come to its full epidemiological cycle, and that more severe strains
of the dengue virus have emerged. He said he had instructed all
provincial public health offices throughout the country to set plans
for the control of the outbreaks of dengue fever as well as other
major communicable diseases including bird flu.
The plans would include the eradication of the _Aedes_ mosquito which
transmits dengue. Physical destruction of the mosquito population is
considered the most effective preventive measure against infection.

The health authorities in both Thailand and Cambodia are concerned
about the early emergence of dengue outbreaks, when the rainy season
is as yet to arrive. Thailand has already reported 8 confirmed
deaths, however no exact figures were given with regard to the cases
of dengue classic and dengue hemorrhagic fever among a total of 4971
dengue infections. - Mod.RY]
