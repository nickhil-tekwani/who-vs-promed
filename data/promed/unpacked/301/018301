Update on a cluster of COVID-19 in Beijing, People's Republic of China
----------------------------------------------------------------
After 56 days of no reported confirmed COVID-19 cases or asymptomatic infections in Beijing, People's Republic of China, a local case of COVID-19 with no known travel history or contact with a case was reported on [11 Jun 2020].

WHO published a press release [see B. below] summarizing the event as of [13 Jun 2020].

From [11-14 Jun 2020] (as of 18:00 CEST+6 [14 Jun 2020]), 77 symptomatic laboratory-confirmed cases have been identified related to this cluster in Beijing, including 2 cases who travelled to Liaoning Province. An additional 46 laboratory confirmed cases, reported without symptoms, have been identified through active screening in the area. The initial symptomatic cases were identified from presentation at 6 fever clinics and most of the initial cases were linked to the Xinfadi Market in Beijing.

Preliminary investigations continue and as of [14 Jun 2020], WHO is aware of 40 environmental samples from the Xinfadi market, which have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 using molecular tests (RT-PCR). Genetic sequencing from humans and environmental samples is ongoing and WHO encourages the release of these sequences as soon as possible. WHO understands that genetic sequences will be released as soon as possible once further laboratory analyses are completed.

Chinese officials have informed WHO of ongoing investigations into the source of the cluster as well as the extent of the current infection among contacts and others who have visited markets in recent weeks. WHO recommends that thorough investigations continue to better understand the source of the cluster (exploring multiple hypotheses) and the extent of infection.

All identified cases are currently isolated and receiving care, depending on clinical presentation, and contacts of all cases, including those without symptoms, are being followed up and tested.

The public health response by Chinese officials includes:
- tracing and monitoring of close contacts of all laboratory conformed cases (regardless of the development of symptoms);
- 6 wholesale food markets in Beijing have fully or partially closed operations;
- those working in Xinfadi Market, those living in the surrounding residential compounds, and those who have visited the Xinfadi Market in the preceding weeks are being traced and will undergo testing;
- under the Emergency Response framework, some of the local measures that were relaxed had been re-implemented in Beijing;
- enhanced screening measures implemented at points of entry.

WHO is closely monitoring the situation and is in close contact with national authorities in China.

WHO is following up with Chinese authorities about a cluster of COVID-19 cases in Beijing, People's Republic of China. Today [13 Jun 2020], officials from the National Health Commission and Beijing Health Commission briefed WHO's China country office, to share details of preliminary investigations ongoing in Beijing.

As of [13 Jun 2020], 41 symptomatic laboratory confirmed cases and 46 laboratory confirmed cases without symptoms of COVID-19 have been identified in Beijing.

The 1st identified case had symptom onset on [9 Jun 2020] and was confirmed on [11 Jun 2020]. Several of the initial cases were identified through 6 fever clinics in Beijing. Preliminary investigations revealed that some of the initial symptomatic cases had a link to the Xinfadi Market in Beijing. Preliminary laboratory investigations of throat swabs from humans and environmental samples from Xinfadi Market identified 45 positive human samples (all without symptoms at the time of reporting) and 40 positive environmental samples. One additional case without symptoms was identified as a close contact of a confirmed case.

All cases are in isolation and under care as needed, and contact tracing is underway. Genetic sequencing of samples is also underway and rapid sharing of these results is important to understand the origin of the cluster and links between cases.

WHO has offered support and technical assistance, as well as requested further information about the cluster and the investigations underway and planned.

After weeks with almost no new coronavirus infections, Beijing has recorded dozens of new cases in recent days, all linked to a major wholesale food market, raising concerns about a resurgence of the disease. The capital is taking steps to try to halt the outbreak including ramping up testing. On Sunday night [14 Jun 2020], Beijing ordered all companies to supervise 14-day home quarantine for employees who have visited the Xinfadi market or been in contact with anyone who has done so. A restaurant chain selling traditional Beijing noodles shut down a few outlets after 2 employees tested positive.

There had been almost no new coronavirus cases in the city for almost 2 months until an infection was reported on [12 Jun 2020], and since then the total number has climbed to 51, including 8 reported in the 1st 7 hours of Sunday [14 Jun 2020].

According to the city's health authority, contact tracing showed all the infected people had either worked or shopped inside Xinfadi, said to be the largest food market in Asia, or had been in contact with someone who was there. "Beijing has entered an extraordinary period," city spokesman Xu Hejian told a news conference on Sunday [14 Jun 2020]. The market was closed before dawn on Saturday [13 Jun 2020] and the district containing the market put itself on a "wartime" footing. The Beijing outbreak has already spread to the neighbouring northeastern province of Liaoning, where the provincial health authority said the 2 new cases confirmed on Sunday [14 Jun 2020] were both people who had been in close contact with confirmed cases in Beijing.

At least 10 Chinese cities, including Harbin and Dalian, have urged residents not to travel to the capital or to report to authorities if they have done so recently.

Huaxiang, a neighbourhood in the same district as the food market and which has one of China's biggest used car centers, raised its epidemic risk level to high on Sunday [14 Jun 2020], becoming the only neighbourhood in the country to be on high alert. This status means there can be no economic activity until the outbreak is controlled. As of 3 pm on Sunday [14 Jun 2020], 10 neighbourhoods in Beijing had raised their risk levels from low to medium.

Like other countries around the world, China is concerned to prevent a 2nd wave from emerging after easing lockdowns that hammered its economy earlier this year [2020]. "Beijing will not turn into a 2nd Wuhan, spreading the virus to many cities all over the country and needing a lockdown," a government epidemic expert told Health Times on Sunday [13 Jun 2020], referring to the city where the epidemic in China 1st emerged late last year [2019].

Zeng Guang, former chief epidemiologist at Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention and currently a senior expert with the National Health Commission, said the outbreak will likely be controlled after the initial spike of a few days, according to the report by Health Times, a paper run by state media People's Daily.

An epidemiologist with the Beijing government said on Sunday [14 Jun 2020] that a DNA sequencing of the virus showed the latest outbreak in the market could have come from Europe. "Our preliminary assessment is the virus came from overseas. We still can't determine how it got here. It might've been on contaminated seafood or meat, or spread from the faeces of people inside the market," state media quoted Yang Peng as saying.

Officials said anyone who had been to or had contact with people who had been to Xinfadi since [30 May 2020] will be required to report to their work or residential units and get tested for coronavirus, the Beijing Daily said on Saturday [13 Jun 2020]. Beijing health authority spokesman Gao Xiaojun told the news conference on Sunday [14 Jun 2020] that anyone in the city with a fever will be given tests for the coronavirus, a blood test, and a CT scan.

ProMED-mail rapporteur Kunihiko Iizuka

[ProMED-mail would like to thank Daniel Lucey MD, for alerting us to this outbreak yesterday (13 Jun 2020). Media reports at that time mentioned that positive environmental samples included cutting boards used for cutting imported salmon from Europe (reportedly from Norway and Denmark's Faroe Islands). https://www.news.com.au/world/coronavirus/global/coronavirus-parts-of-beijing-locked-down-as-fresh-virus-cluster-emerges-at-food-market/news-story/afb9bb93c7c165dccf6ea120cbe5145a, https://whtc.com/news/articles/2020/jun/13/beijing-wholesale-market-temporarily-shut-after-new-coronavirus-infections/1028975.

Other media reports have mentioned that pangolins were sold in the market, as one of the suspected intermediate hosts (but not proven) for the SARS-CoV-2. (Article explaining how pangolins are a delicacy in China and how the Jingshen Seafood Market has a history of selling pangolins. Submitted and translated by ProMED rapporteur Dan Silver http://www.chuannane.com/shiyao/20170215/7029.html). Mod.AS commented "It has been shown that cats are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. In view of cats' known taste for fish, their population in and around fish markets is expected to be of marked density. Including them in surveillance for the said virus (including serology), in such locations, deserves consideration." Clearly the investigations and control measures are being implemented rapidly, taking into consideration that it is now 3 days since the 1st positive case was identified.

While the genomic studies on the involved virus point towards an importation from Europe, if related to imported fish it would be the 1st documentation of this as a route of transmission. I can't help but wonder if an individual returning from Europe was asymptomatically infected and had false negative PCR test results that may have started a chain of transmission that reached the market, which then amplified the transmission chains. Although it is clearly tempting to see the parallels with the seafood market in Wuhan, remembering that among the "early cases" identified with dates of onset in early December 2019 did not have a history of contact with the market. We await further information of investigation results as they become available.

https://businesstech.co.za/news/trending/407531/70038-confirmed-coronavirus-cases-in-south-africa-as-deaths-climb-to-1480/


Health minister Dr Zweli Mkhize has announced that South Africa now has 70 038 confirmed cases of coronavirus. This is up by 4302‬ cases from the 65 736 infections on Saturday [13 Jun 2020] when the country recorded 3809 new cases. The minister announced 57 new deaths, taking the total up to 1480, while recoveries increased to 38 531, which translates to a recovery rate of 55%.

A total of 1.12 million tests have been conducted to date, of which 34 071 tests have been conducted over the past 24-hour period.

Province breakdown of cases [from MOH tweet shown in article https://tinyurl.com/yd4v6bla]:

Province: Cumulative cases as of 14 Jun 2020 / Percentage of total
--------
Eastern Cape: 10 027 / 14.3
Free State: 495 / 0.7
Gauteng: 11 164 / 15.9
KwaZulu-Natal: 3874 / 5.5
Limpopo: 326 / 0.5

Northern Cape: 156 / 0.2
Western Cape: 42 539 / 60.7
Unknown: 63 / 0.1
Total: 70 038 / 100

While the country's [COVID-19] cases continue to increase, the government currently has no plans to review its relaxed lockdown rules and does not plan to reintroduce a countrywide ban on the sale of alcohol at this point in time. Speaking to the Sunday Times, minister in the presidency Jackson said that the cabinet had not discussed reversing the relaxation of regulations: "The decision of cabinet stands. It is not up for reviewal ... we have not discussed the reviewal of those measures. Not at all. All we have said is let's have discussions with the experts and see how they look at measures that we have taken so that we are advised."

He added that the National Coronavirus Command Council (NCCC) will receive a briefing from the health ministerial advisory council (MAC) on Tuesday [16 Jun 2020] to get an understanding of how the relaxed regulations have impacted the health system. It is also expected to advise on the impact of the tobacco ban and whether the government can open the economy further -- including allowing seated patrons at restaurants, and hotels and B&Bs to operate.

[On 21 May 2020, for the 1st time South Africa reported more than 1000 newly confirmed cases in a day; this escalated to the 2000-3000+ daily increase in newly confirmed cases on 4 Jun 2020, and today, for the 1st time, South Africa reported more than 4000 newly confirmed cases. Looking at the case distribution, the Western Cape is the epicenter of the outbreak with 60.7% of the cumulative cases reported, followed by Gauteng at 15.9% and the Eastern Cape at 14.3% (more data on the distribution of deaths and recoveries is available at https://sacoronavirus.co.za/2020/06/14/update-on-covid-19-14th-june-2020/). In terms of daily increases, from 13-14 Jun 2020, the Western Cape reported 45.0% of the newly confirmed cases, Gauteng reported 29.5% and the Eastern Cape reported 18.1%. South Africa now ranks as number 21 globally in terms of cumulative cases reported and number 1 in the African region.

In the absence of a protective safe vaccine and limited treatment modalities for severe cases, the critical factor to reducing the prevalence of active cases relies upon non-pharmaceutical measures such as face masks and social distancing, both challenges in the lower socioeconomic population groups within South Africa, living in crowded townships. Continued lifting of restrictions as case counts climb may have significant repercussions, as already seen in other countries.

*The situation report includes information provided by national authorities as of 10:00 CEST, 14 Jun 2020.

Highlights
----------
- The investigation of a cluster of COVID-19 in Beijing associated with a wholesale market continues. As of [14 Jun 2020], 16:00 (CEST+6), Chinese authorities reported a total of 77 cases since [11 Jun 2020], including 2 linked cases in Liaoning Province. See [section [1] above] for more information and press statement issued on [13 Jun 2020].

- World Elder Abuse Awareness Day takes place every year on [15 Jun 2020] as designated by the United Nations General Assembly. It is believed that abuse towards older people has risen significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic. This makes a compelling case for World Elder Abuse Awareness Day's call for decision-makers to develop universally applicable normative standards for the protection of older people.

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 215.

In the 24 hours since the last WHO update:
-----------------------------------------
The Americas region reported 53.3% of the global newly reported cases and 65.7% of newly reported fatalities for this 24-hour period. Brazil reported 35.5% of the newly confirmed cases in the region, the USA reported 30.2%, Chile 8.9%, Peru 8.1%, and Mexico 7.1%.

The European region reported 14.4% of the global newly reported cases and 44.6% of the newly confirmed cases in the region, followed by Turkey 7.4%, the UK 7.2%, Sweden 6.3%, Belarus 3.6%, and Ukraine 3.3%.

The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 15.2% of the global newly reported cases and 8.9% of global newly reported fatalities. Pakistan reported 32.6% of the regional newly reported cases, followed by Saudi Arabia 16.1%, Iran 11.5%, Qatar 8.7%, Egypt 8.0%, and Oman 4.8%.

The African region reported 4.6% of the global newly reported cases and 3.1% of newly reported fatalities. South Africa reported 60.3% of the newly reported cases in the region in the past 24 hours, followed by Nigeria 9.9%, Ghana 4.2%, Ethiopia 4.0%, Cote d'Ivoire 2.6%, Kenya 2.4%, and Senegal 2.3%.

The Western Pacific region reported 0.84% of the global newly reported cases and 0.58% of global fatalities. The Philippines reported 52.7% of the newly reported cases in the region, followed by Singapore 30.2%, China 5.0%, Japan 4.1%, and Malaysia 3.7%. This is the 1st time in over 2 months that China has had more than a negligible contribution to the daily reported cases in the region.

The South East Asia region reported 11.7% of the global newly reported cases and 9.3% of global fatalities. India reported 74.1%% of newly reported cases in the region, followed by Bangladesh 17.7%, Indonesia 6.3%, and Nepal 1.7%.

Impression: Europe seems to be stabilizing at a significantly lower rate, although Russia is still reporting 8000+ new cases a day. The Eastern Mediterranean has surpassed the European region with Pakistan reporting 6000+ cases a day. South East Asia is approaching parity with the European and Eastern Mediterranean regions with India reporting 8000-10 000+ cases a day. The Americas region is reporting over 70 000 cases a day with Brazil reporting 25 000-30 000+ cases a day, and the USA seems to have stabilized at 20 000+ a day. In the Africa region, the regional proportion is slowly climbing, with South Africa reporting in the 2000-3000+ range daily, and in the Western Pacific region, they are maintaining a very low rate compared with the other regions, with Singapore and the Philippines averaging 400+ cases per day (Singapore had been reporting twice as many cases per day for a period of time but has dropped back over the past couple of weeks).

Figure 2. Epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases, by date of report and WHO region, 30 Dec 2019 through 14 Jun 2020, at the source URL above, is an excellent representation of the epidemic starting in the Western Pacific, transitioning to multiregional activity as the virus travelled. Europe has significantly decreased. The Americas region continues to increase, as does South East Asia, which is approaching parity with the European region in terms of daily newly confirmed cases and the Eastern Mediterranean, which has overtaken the European region; the African region is noticeably increasing as well. The Americas region continues to greatly outnumber all other regions for daily reporting. - Mod.MPP]

[According to the data on the Worldometer website, the total number of reported cases of COVID-19 worldwide is now 7 817 294, with reports of cases by 217 countries and territories worldwide. The global case count increased by 1.6% in the past 24 hours. The USA, with more than 2.16 million confirmed cases, now represents 27.1% of the global cases of COVID-19, as other countries such as Brazil, Chile, Peru, Mexico, India, and Pakistan are reporting increased numbers of new and cumulative cases significantly. A global total of 435 177 deaths have been reported, an increase of 3009 deaths in the past 24 hours. A reminder that in the absence of well-developed contact tracing activities with testing of asymptomatic and mildly ill contacts, there is major underreporting of numbers of infections with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, possibly 1/10th to 1/20th in order of magnitude. There are also individuals who stay at home throughout their illness, sometimes, unfortunately, dying at home and who are never officially confirmed as infected with the SARS-CoV-2. These data are presented to provide relative indicators of the situations in each of the countries and comparisons between countries and regions of the world.

In descending rank order, the USA is number one for cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19, followed by Brazil, Russia, India, the UK, Spain, Italy, Peru, Germany, and Iran at number 10. China is number 19, no change in ordering in the past 48 hours. In descending rank order, the USA is number one for the number of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, followed by Brazil, India, Peru, Russia, Chile, Pakistan, South Africa, Saudi Arabia, and Bangladesh.

The top 20 countries in terms of absolute cumulative cases, which include 7 from the European region, 6 from the Americas region, 4 from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 2 from the South East Asia region, and one from the Western Pacific region, unchanged in the past week. There are no countries from the Africa region. The top 20 countries with most newly confirmed cases include 7 from the Americas region, 7 from the, 7 from the Eastern Mediterranean region 3 from the European region, 2 from the South-East Asia region, and one from the African region, none from the Western Pacific region. This listing very much reflects the "hot spots" in terms of countries with ongoing high transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. - Mod.MPP]
