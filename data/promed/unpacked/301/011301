Fourth Potential French Variant CJD Victim
------------------------------------------
PARIS: A fourth potential victim of new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease
[abbreviated vCJD or CJD (new var.) in ProMED-mail, the human form of "mad
cow" disease, has been identified in France, according to a government web
site. The French National Institute of Health, which updates the number of
identified cases of the disease each month, announced on its Web site
that: To date, 4 certain or probable cases of vCJD have
been identified in France.
Until now, 3 French people have died as a result of this fatal condition,
which is caused by infected beef and has so far proved incurable. The
identity of the fourth person, who is alive and according to media reports
aged 35, was not revealed.
Only post-mortem tests can determine with absolute certainty that a patient
is suffering from the deadly human form of bovine spongiform encephalopathy
(BSE), although biopsies on living people are viewed as fairly reliable.
Those who contract vCJD suffer loss of coordination, confusion and
personality changes. More than 100 people have died from the disease since
the mid-1990s, most of them in Britain. A leading scientist in Britain
estimated this past week that cases had increased by 20 percent in the
country last year. A report published by the French Senate earlier this
year said France can expect up to 300 cases of vCJD in the next 60 years.

Quinacrine Approved for Treatment of Variant CJD in France
----------------------------------------------------------
[The following information has been extracted from the September web page
of the Institute de Veille Sanitaire which is responsible for public health
surveillance.
A fourth person infected with variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) has
been identified in France. The patient is alive and no other details have
been given, other than the patient is younger [than 40 years of age.
After the UK, France is the country in Europe with the most cases of vCJD.
The first human case was reported in Lyon in 1996, a second patient of 36
years died in February 2000 and the third a 19 years old man, last April.
Following the findings of S. Prusiner and colleagues, last month the French
health authorities approved the use of quinacrine for treatment of patients
suffering vCJD.
