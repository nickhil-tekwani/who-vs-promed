From: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>


From a source generally known to us as reliable, we received the following
information on 22 Apr 2005:

Since 15 Apr 2005 there have been rumors about FMD in the Jiangsu province.
Today, 22 Apr 2005, a message has been received from a contact, informing
us of an outbreak of FMD in Wuxi (Xizhang district) where 200 cows have
allegedly been culled. There seems to be no authoritative confirmation of
the said information.

[Jiangsu is a province of eastern China bordering on the Yellow Sea (1000
km coastline), with an area of 100 000 square km (38 600 square miles),
densely populated and highly industrialized. Nanjing is the capital and the
population is 72 100 000.

The message included some additional details about the location of the
affected cattle operation affected. No outbreak of FMD has been reported to
the Office International des Epizooties (OIE) from China since May 1999.
Monthly reports -- all indicating the absence of disease -- have been sent
since Sep 2003; the last one currently available on OIE's website dates
back to Sep 2004.

Any available information, and particularly the results of possible
investigations of animal-health authorities into the matter, will be
appreciated. For additional background information, see commentary in the
references below. - Mod.AS]
