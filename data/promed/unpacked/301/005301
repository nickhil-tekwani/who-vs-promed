Thirteen human anthrax cases were recorded at Sesfontein in the Kunene Region after 35 residents consumed the meat of livestock which died of unknown disease. No deaths have been reported, and the disease has since been contained says Health and Social Services permanent secretary, Ben Nangombe.

In a joint statement signed by both the Ministry of Health and Social Services and that of Agriculture, a total of 92 small stock died from the outbreak in Sesfontein, while 23 buffalo died in the Bwabwata National Park. The ministries are collaborating in the matter and have informed all farmers and the general public about the danger in the affected areas.

Post exposure prophylactic medicines have also been administered thus far to 44 people in the areas of Omiriu and Okamba yOzongombo in Kunene. Symptoms and signs in humans include swollen and painful lymph glands, vomiting, abdominal pain, headaches, loss of appetite, fever, and sore throat.
