After confirming that someone has contracted the potentially deadly hantavirus, Alberta Health Services is urging residents to take simple precautions. The infected person is from a rural community in central Alberta, according to a news release issued Wednesday [28 Aug 2013] by AHS.

Hantavirus[es] [are] transferred to humans from exposure to mice, so AHS recommends that people take extra precautions when dealing with mouse droppings and dead mice. "Because humans can be exposed to [a] hantavirus when the urine or feces of an infected rodent -- such as a mouse -- become airborne, anyone who disturbs areas of mice or mice droppings can be at risk," Dr. Ifeoma Achebe, Medical Officer of Health, Central Zone, said in the release. "It is essential that Albertans take precautions to protect themselves and greatly reduce their risk of illness."

Some tips that AHS offered include: wearing rubber gloves when cleaning mouse droppings, soaking dead mice and droppings in a bleach solution and never using a broom to sweep up droppings or dead mice, as the dust can carry the virus and make it airborne.

Although the virus is rare, it can be fatal. Symptoms will usually show up one to 2 weeks after exposure, but AHS says they can appear up to 5 weeks later. Watch for severe flu, including fever, body aches, chills, abdominal problems and severe breathing problems.

"It is very important that anyone who has recently been in an area contaminated by mice and who has subsequently developed severe flu-like symptoms or difficulty breathing see a doctor immediately," Achebe said.

[The above report does not indicate how the infected individual is doing clinically or the specific dates and place where the infection was acquired. Sporadic cases of hantavirus infections in humans have occurred in Canada's Prairie Provinces and British Columbia for several years. This report does not indicate which hantavirus is involved in this case, but it is likely to be Sin Nombre virus. The circumstances under which the infection occurred are not given.
