Tajikistan: Both _P.vivax_ and _P.falciparum_ malaria increasing
------------------
Malaria remains a source of concern in Tajikistan due in part to the
collapse of preventive measures after the country gained independence in
1991. Cases of the deadly _Plasmodium falciparum_ malaria have increased
in the past year.
"The current situation with malaria in Tajikistan is very similar to that
of 2002," Nazira Artykova, head of the World Health Organisation (WHO)
office in Tajikistan, told IRIN from the capital, Dushanbe, adding that
according to official statistics, the total number of registered cases for
the first 6 months of 2003 was 1474, showing a decrease of 3.1 percent
compared to 1521 incidences in 2002.
She said that the number of newly registered cases was 972 in 2003, while
that figure stood at 930 in 2002. However, the number of recurring cases
fell to 502 in 2003 from 591 in 2002, indicating an improvement in the
quality of registration.
Meanwhile, the number of falciparum malaria, the most deadly type of the
disease, had increased from 17 in 2002 to 39 in 2003, she said. Artykova
said that the main cause of the increased number of falciparum cases was
the return of ethnic Tajiks from neighbouring Afghanistan in recent years.
The increase was also a reflection of improving registration and
surveillance control of the disease, which had collapsed during the
disintegration of the Soviet Union in 1991 and the civil war of the mid-1990's.
Merlin, a British NGO with extensive international experience in malaria
control, working in Tajikistan since 1997, has also noted that _Plasmodium
falciparum_ malaria has been increasing more rapidly than other forms of
malaria, with increased health risks for the affected populations.
Additionally, during the last decade local populations had revived rice
plantations in restricted areas, which also contributed to the spread of
the disease, Artykova said, noting that drug resistance was a further issue
of concern.
The WHO official said the Tajik government was showing political commitment
to dealing with the issue and had adopted the National Malaria Control
Programme, which was operating successfully with international support.
However, much needs to be done, health officials say. "The national budget
of the country and international inputs are not sufficient to address all
malaria-related problems," Artykova claimed, calling for more resources to
tackle it. She said WHO had facilitated the Tajik authorities' application
to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria for a grant for
malaria control, adding that more resources and technical assistance in
surveillance control were still needed.
Meanwhile, Rano Mansurova, the health coordinator for Central Asia at
ACTED, a French NGO working in the country since 1997 on the prevention of
malaria, observed some signs of stabilisation. "The situation has improved
a little bit recently," she told IRIN from the southeastern Tajik city of
Kurgan-Tyube. She said the lack of coordination between
sanitary-epidemiological units, central hospitals, and hospitals in the
rural areas had also contributed to the rise of malaria morbidity in the
country.
Mansurova said her organisation was distributing mosquito nets impregnated
with insecticides every year and using insecticides within buildings. It
was also introducing Gambusia fish, which consume the mosquito larvae, into
bodies of water, and was cleaning lakes and ponds with the involvement of
the local population. Education was also critical in eradicating the killer
disease by raising local people's awareness, she said.
She also said ACTED had been conducting parasitological research in order
to identify the types of mosquitoes infesting the region as such
information would help in developing the right strategy to fight them.
ACTED had also been conducting research to detect parasites in human blood,
emphasising the need for treatment. "We won't be able to resolve the
problem while there are people carrying the disease," she warned.
She also underlined the need to conduct prevention, monitoring, and
treatment of malaria in neighbouring Afghanistan, where malaria incidences
were very high. "We need to stop the disease from spreading," she
explained, adding that the malaria roll-back efforts should be made
globally in order to completely eradicate the problem.
Since the early 1990s, malaria, which had almost been eradicated in Central
Asia, has begun to return, owing to political and economic instability,
massive population movements, and large-scale development projects.
According to Merlin, at present nearly 18 million people, or more than 30
percent of the Central Asian population, live in areas at risk from malaria.

[The WHO Regional office for Europe estimates that in the year 2000,
nearly 20 000 malaria cases were reported. However, a survey in 2001 in
Khatlon region showed that more than 10 percent of the study population
were asymptomatic parasite carriers of _P. vivax_ and _P. falciparum_ and
indicates that the number of malaria cases may be as high as 150 000 to 250
000. <http://www.who.dk/malaria/ctryinfo/affected/20020712_1>
