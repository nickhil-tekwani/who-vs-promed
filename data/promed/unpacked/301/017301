NSW [New South Wales] Health has issued a warning following an outbreak of shigellosis among gay [homosexual] men in Sydney. Shigellosis is a bacterial infection that causes bowel disease. The infection is transmitted through feces, and symptoms include stomach cramps, diarrhoea, fever, and nausea. The infection can appear any time between 12 hours and 4 days from exposure and symptoms can persist for up to a week.

NSW Health says the increase in cases appears to be amongst gay men in inner Sydney, and coincides with a recent increase in shigellosis cases among gay men in Victoria [the next state south of NSW].

With an influx of thousands of gay visitors expected for the Mardi Gras season [7 Feb-2 Mar 2014], NSW Health's Communicable Diseases Branch is concerned further infections may occur. Infections can arise from sexual contact during activities such as rimming [anal-oral contact] or when tiny particles of feces enter the mouth. The best way to avoid infection is to wash hands thoroughly after any sexual activity, after touching equipment like used condoms and sex toys, and after going to the toilet or before handling food.

ACON [health promotion organization with a central focus on HIV/AIDS] CEO Nicolas Parkhill said infection could be dangerous for those with compromised immune systems. "The disease can be worse in anyone with a poor immune system, such as people with HIV who are more likely to have severe symptoms which may result in a prolonged illness and even hospitalisation," he said. Parkhill advised gay men should also avoid sex while they have symptoms and for at least 7 days after the symptoms clear.

NSW Health said anyone with prolonged diarrhoea should see a doctor, as antibiotics may need to be prescribed if a shigella infection is present.

[_Shigella_ was discovered over 100 years ago by the Japanese microbiologist, Kiyoshi Shiga, for whom the genus is named. There are 4 species: _S. boydii_, _S. dysenteriae_, _S. flexneri_, and _S. sonnei_. _Shigella_ organisms can survive transit through the stomach since they are less susceptible to acid than other bacteria; for this reason, as few as 10 to 100 organisms can cause disease. Ingested bacteria pass into the small intestine where they multiply; large numbers of bacteria then pass into the colon, where they enter the colonic cells. Given its relatively low infectious dose, transmission can occur via contaminated food and water or via direct person-to-person spread including sexual practices more common in men who have sex with men. Humans are the only natural reservoir for disease.

Dysentery (formerly known as flux or the bloody flux) is an inflammatory disorder of the colon, which results in severe diarrhea containing mucus and/or blood in the feces with fever, abdominal pain, and rectal tenesmus (pain while passing the diarrhea). - Mod.LL
