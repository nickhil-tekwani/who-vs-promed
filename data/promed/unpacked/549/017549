[This is another update of the dengue situation in New Caledonia, based on
the latest official report from the Department of Health of New Caledonia.
Thanks to Dr. JP Grangeon and Nancy Klingler for keeping PACNET focal point
posted - TK.
As mentioned in previous messages, the weekly number of new cases has been
still continuously increasing since December 1997; 1,819 cases were
notified from 1 January to 4 May 1998; 938 of the 943 new cases for which
the type of dengue was confirmed were type 2 dengue -- the 5 remaining ones
were type 3 dengue (reported in the previous update); no other confirmed
type 3 dengue new case has been reported since the last update. No death
was reported. Dengue seems to be mainly a problem in the area of and around
Noumea: the major part of the new cases of the 4 weeks prior to 4 May 1998
are from Noumea (32.4%) and Mont-Dore (15.8%), the rest being from all over
the territory (with some exceptions like "Ile des Pins" where no cases have
been reported at all in 1998).
The weekly number of clinical new cases (including the confirmed ones) from
the week starting on 24/11/97 (week 48 of 1997) to the week starting on
27/04/98 (week 18 of 1998) is shown below:

The Department of Heath is still agressively applying perifocal vector
control measures including insecticide spraying and reduction of mosquito
breeding sites.
