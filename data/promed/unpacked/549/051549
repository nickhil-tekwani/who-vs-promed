99/076 First report of peach latent mosaic viroid in Egypt on
apple and pear
*************************
This is the first report of PLMVd in Egypt, and also the first time
that this viroid has been detected on apple and pear.
*************************
In Egypt, peach latent mosaic viroid (PLMVd -- quarantine status
under review) has been detected in apple fruit (_Malus domestica_
cv. Golden Delicious) and pear (_Pyrus communis_) bark and fruit.
This viroid induces canker on bark, scab and streak disease of
fruit. The presence of PLMVd was detected by using RT-PCR,
followed by Southern and dot blot hybridization analysis of the
amplified products with a PLMVd cRNA probe. It is noted that trees
infected by PLMVd have sporadically been found in commercial
orchards of apple and pear.

mosaic viroid in apple (Malus domestica). Annals of Agricultural
Science (Cairo), 43(1), 21-30.
Review of Plant Pathology, 78(2), abstract 1389, p 187.
[Over half of the peach germplasm in Europe, Asia, and the Americas is
infected with PLMVd. The viroid can be efficiently transmitted from
infected to healthy plants by grafting and by viroid-contaminated pruning
tools. Its occurrence in Egypt and its detection in apple and pear
indicate wider geographic and host ranges, hence this report - Mod.DH]
