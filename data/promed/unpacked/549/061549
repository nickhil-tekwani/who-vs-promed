China: melamine-contaminated powdered infant formula in China - WHO update 2
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
More than 54 000 infants and young children have sought medical
treatment in relation to the melamine-contaminated dairy products in
China, causing kidney stone; 3 deaths among infants have been
confirmed, more than 13 000 infants are in hospital. Kidney stones in
infants are normally very rare.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has published "Melamine and
Cyanuric acid: Toxicity, Preliminary Risk Assessment and Guidance on
Levels in Food."
[<http://www.who.int/foodsafety/fs_management/Melamine.pdf>].
Thispreliminary guidance was developed to assist national authorities in
the decision-making process on deciding possible health concerns of
melamine levels in food.

This preliminary guidance is proposed as a 1st pragmatic approach
until more data become available, which would allow a more detailed
assessment.
