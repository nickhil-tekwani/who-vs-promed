Haitian healthcare officials say they're getting more than 1000 new
cases of cholera daily with the return of the rainy season. Nearly
6000 people have died since the cholera outbreak began in October
2010, although many healthcare providers believe the number to be
higher, the Los Angeles Times reported.

"We are still in an epidemic," said Jocelyne Pierre Louis, spokeswoman
for Haiti's Ministry of Public Health. Poor sanitation is the root
problem in the spread of the disease, which is transmitted through
contaminated water, in a country with no central sewage or potable
water systems, the Times said.

"If we want to make cholera disappear, it will be with water and
sanitation," said Romain Gitenet, head of the Haiti mission for
France-based Doctors Without Borders, which has opened cholera
treatment centers across the country.

The sanitation issue got worse as a result of the 12 Jan 2010,
earthquake that left tens of thousands of Haitians homeless, the
report said. "The problem of sanitation can't be dealt with between
today and tomorrow," Louis said.

The Dominican Republic's death toll in the cholera epidemic that
spread from Haiti has risen to 87 out of more than 13 000 suspected
cases, authorities said on Fri 22 Jul 2011. The country shares the
island of Hispaniola with Haiti, where the epidemic began.

The Dominican health ministry reported that the death toll had risen
by 16 since 8 Jul 2011 to 87. According to the ministry, there have
been 773 new cases in the past week, for a total of 13 200 since the
beginning of the epidemic, which spread to the Dominican Republic from
Haiti in November 2010.

Latin American countries have been far more careful since 1991, when
an outbreak of the disease occurred in Peru and then moved into
several countries across the region, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia,
Ecuador, Guatemala, El Salvador, and Mexico, causing some 10 000
deaths, according to the WHO.

[3] EU warning for tourists to Dominican Republic

European Union (EU) health officials have issued a warning to
travelers about the risk of contracting cholera in the Dominican
Republic, a magnet for tourists, and Haiti.

The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) said in
a report that cholera is becoming endemic in the Dominican Republic.
The country shares the island of Hispaniola with Haiti, which has been
battling a large cholera epidemic since October 2010.

Cholera is becoming endemic in both countries," the report says. "It
is anticipated that further epidemic peaks will occur, particularly
during the rainy season."

To date, 2 European tourists, a 69-year-old English woman and a
60-year-old German woman, contracted cholera while staying at resorts
in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic, in May 2011, the report states.
Theirs were the 1st Dominican-linked cases reported by EU member
states since the epidemic began. The sources of their infections were
not pinpointed and could have been either water or food.

More than a million European tourists visit the Dominican Republic
annually, according to the report. It said Haiti receives far fewer
European visitors, with just 23 000 in 2007.

Because of the size of the Dominican epidemic, occasional
travel-related cases can be expected and may increase during the
country's rainy seasons, the ECDC says. Overall, though, the risk of
cholera in visitors to the country should be considered low.

The ECDC says visitors to cholera-endemic countries should drink only
bottled or chlorinated water, carefully wash all fruits and vegetables
with potable water, regularly wash their hands, and eat seafood only
if it is thoroughly cooked. In the EU, cholera vaccination is not
routinely recommended for travelers, but it might be considered for
people who work in refugee camps and certain other groups.
