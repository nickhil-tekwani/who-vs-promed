Health officials in Canada's British Columbia have declared a COVID-19 outbreak at a mink farm after 8 people tested positive for the disease, with employees and animals now undergoing testing and contact tracing in a bid to control the spread of the virus.

The Fraser Health Authority, which oversees the area in question and did not mention how the disease was spread to farm workers, announced the outbreak on Sunday [6 Dec 2020], confirming employees were being tested and, where appropriate, self-isolating and tracing contacts.

Under existing laws governing animal health, the farm has been ordered to restrict the transportation of animals, products, and goods from the farm, Fraser Health Authority said.

The Agriculture Ministry of British Columbia said in a statement the outbreak is limited to just one farm in Fraser Valley, adding some animals are being sent to a national testing facility dedicated to foreign animal diseases in Winnipeg.

What to watch for
-----------------
It is currently unclear what will happen to the mink at this farm or whether they even have the disease. The outlook could be grim. Farmers in the entire region, or even country, will likely be following the outbreak with trepidation given the swift and heavy handed responses authorities around the world have taken when there have been outbreaks at mink farms. Denmark, for instance, illegally ordered the cull of its entire 17 million-strong herd after discovering a potentially dangerous COVID-19 strain had moved from mink into humans. In a bid to protect the future of the industry and the safety of its populace, Canadian authorities could be moved to take similarly drastic measures.

Key background
--------------
Mink, which are prized for their fur, appear to be particularly hard hit by the coronavirus, with outbreaks tearing through herds around the world and, in some cases, making the move back into human populations. This kind of disease transmission can be quite dangerous -- and it is how COVID-19 initially moved into humans -- because when pathogens cross the species barrier they can present something novel, and challenging, to the immune system, which may struggle to adapt to the new threat. The cramped, high-density conditions farmed mink are kept in exacerbate this issue, creating the ideal conditions for diseases to spread.

[While this is sad news, I was stuck with the thought that minks need to have some social distance. The virus is believed to spread from close contact and minks are in a facility without much distance between the animals. Perhaps, adding HEPA filters to the air handlers may be helpful?

I am saddened to learn of this event. Saddened for the animals and for the individuals involved who may have encountered the virus.

There is no indication as to how these minks became infected. The question then becomes, was a human caretaker the source of the virus to the minks? Or was the virus within the food, or bedding, or water, or some other source?

The mink fur trade is big business and this is certainly a blow to the producers of this facility as well as the anxiety which surely must be at a high pitch in other facilities. Restricting movement and doing more extensive testing seems an appropriate measure. - Mod.TG
