Seven cases of malaria in Albania
---------------------------------
The correspondent reports that 7 cases of malaria have been registered in Albania, for the 1st time since 1970.

According to Dimitar Kraja, head of infectious diseases of the State Hospital in Tirana, these cases have been registered recently.

This information was presented at a conference held in Tirana on "infectious diseases in Albania". According to Kraja, all the data indicate that the [increase in cases is a result of imported cases] from Greece and Italy.

The conference stated that Albania needs to take measures to strengthen border controls to detect people suffering from malaria, and in the 2 neighboring countries.

[The report above states only that the cases were diagnosed in recent times without indicating whether this is within the last month or the last 5 years. The article makes the conjectural statement that the patients may have been infected in Italy, although there is no known malaria transmission in Italy.

Albania reported a malaria case in 2010 suspected infected in Greece (ProMED-mail posting Malaria - Albania: RFI: 20100518.1634). If this is true, it indicates that malaria transmission was present in Greece before the outbreak was reported in 2011.

The patients may have been infected in Greece, if the history shows that they have been in areas where _Plasmodium vivax_ transmission took place in 2011 and 2012. However, more information is needed to determine this.

The conclusion that border controls should be tightened seems unfounded and not based on facts. - Mod.EP
