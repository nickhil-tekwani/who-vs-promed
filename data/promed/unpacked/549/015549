Police in Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan are looking for answers on why 5
kids ingested seeds from a toxic plant over the weekend. Corp. Dave
Purdy said police were notified Monday [20 Sep 2010] that the kids --
said to be between 11 and 15 -- had been taken to hospital when
parents noticed something was wrong.

Purdy said the investigation is ongoing, but is "kind of on hold
until we can talk to the kids." He said the youths are being treated
for consumption of Angel's Trumpet, a toxic but legal plant that can
cause many symptoms if ingested, including hallucination, elevated
heart rate, fever, aggression and, in some cases, death.

Purdy said the youths are still in hospital and are unable to speak
to police because they are still experiencing the seeds' effects.

Purdy said one possibility police will likely explore is whether the
youths accessed information on the Internet. "There's just way too
much information, and way too many kids are getting hurt," he said.

Police are advising parents to be aware of what their children are
doing and looking at online.

Grant Wood, assistant professor at the University of Saskatchewan's
Department of Plant Sciences, described Angel's Trumpet as a large
annual flowering plant, part of the Datura family, which contains a
number of toxic plants.

"You'll find that there are some nasty things in the Datura family,
and, therefore, probably you should not be eating any part of that
plant," Wood said.

Angel's Trumpet has been treated as an intoxicant by some for a
number of decades in North America and other parts of the world. An
article published by the American Journal of Psychiatry in 1977
stated intoxication by the plant at that time was "becoming more
frequent due to its use by adolescents and young adults as a legal,
readily available hallucinogen."

In addition to fever and hallucination, the article said symptoms
include delirium, agitation, and persistent memory disturbance.
Severe intoxication can lead to flaccid paralysis, convulsions and death.

[Angel Trumpet's Latin name is _Datura_ spp. There a number of
different species giving a slightly different shape to the leaves or
flowers. However, they all contain the same toxic agents, just in
slightly different proportions. A photo may be seen at:

thorny fruit that contributes to its name may be viewed at:
<http://www.ipm.ucdavis.edu/PMG/D/W-SO-DSTR-FR.001.html>.

The memory tool for Jimsonweed (another name for Angel Trumpet)
intoxication is "Red as a beet, dry as a bone" (flushed, hot, red
skin), and "mad as a hatter" (from Alice in Wonderland, for its
hallucinogenic properties). The seeds have been collected by persons
trying to get "high" because of the hallucinogenic properties. The
article correctly states that intoxicated individuals can appear as
if they have been smoking marijuana. However, the cardiac affects
have proven to be fatal in many cases.

Aside from the 1977 article mentioned above, there has long been the
issue that the hallucinations caused by the seeds were allegedly
similar to that of getting high or getting stoned. However, this
plant's ability to produce the euphoric state that many illicit drug
users seek comes with a rude and possibly deadly surprise. The
increase in body temperature likely has a very different mechanism
than that from an infection. As the skin becomes visibly flushed and
hot, it is likely much more uncomfortable than a fever. - Mod.TG]
