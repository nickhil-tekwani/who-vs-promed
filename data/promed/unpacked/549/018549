DEFRA (Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs) is expected to
make an announcement tomorrow [28 Jan 2008] which will confirm new cases of
bluetongue in Shropshire and Cheshire.
A source close to DEFRA told Farmers Weekly that the cases which had been
discovered in the last few days were not believed to have been found in
imported animals, suggesting the animals had been infected by UK midges
carrying the disease.
It is not yet known what affect the new cases will have on the movement
regulations currently in place, but it could mean the extension of the
protection zone into Wales and further towards the southwest of England,
possibly as far south as Bristol.
This could leave west Wales and the far south west of England as peninsulas
of non-restricted stock. It will also have an impact on vaccination plans,
with more farmers likely to be in the zone due to receive vaccine 1st. This
could dilute the amount of vaccine available to farmers in the 1st wave of
vaccination due to begin in May 2008 and have serious consequences for
virus control this spring and summer 2008. More news will follow as we
receive it.

[In case this piece of information is indeed officially confirmed, it means
that the vector maintains (even if reduced) activity during the winter
months. This is bad news, with expected flare-ups of the disease and its
possible further spread during 2008 into susceptible, sero-negative animal
populations.
According to available information, continental BTV-8 affected countries,
predominantly France, experience also some continued vector activity during
the current winter (2008). Planning for the shortly due mass-vaccination
should be adapted to the unfolding situation, targeting protection by the
immunization of susceptible animals within broader areas than initially
suggested, namely also in BT-receptive areas beyond the declared protection
and surveillance zones. The vaccination should preferably cover more than
80 per cent of the susceptible stock.
