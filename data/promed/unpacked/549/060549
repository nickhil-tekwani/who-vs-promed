Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Introduction of new live animals; Illegal movement of animals.

Epidemiological comments: Within the framework of the epidemiological surveillance of avian influenza in Cameroon, veterinary services from the Extreme North region notified an important mortality of peacocks in an exotic poultry farm located in the Makilingaye township, Tokombere district, Mayo-Sava department, close to the border with Nigeria. Samples were taken and analyzed by the National veterinary laboratory (LAVANET) of Garoua. H5 serotype was confirmed [on 16 Jan 2017] and H5N8 on 19 Jan 2017. Provisional measures were taken according to Law 006 of 16 Apr 2001 on animal health standards applying to livestock diseases legally considered as contagious and notifiable according to the OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Code. Three-km protection zones and 10-km surveillance zones were established, and the appropriate control measures were implemented accordingly. The samples were sent to an international reference laboratory. According to the Director General's letter from 26 Dec 2016, any case of highly pathogenic avian influenza in birds other than poultry, including wild birds, detected from 1 Jan 2017, is notified to the OIE through WAHIS under the new disease name: Highly pathogenic influenza A viruses (infection with) (non-poultry including wild birds).

Control measures
Measures applied: movement control inside the country; screening; disinfection/disinfestations; quarantine; surveillance outside containment and/or protection zone; stamping out; official disposal of carcasses, by-products and waste; surveillance within containment and/or protection zone; zoning; vaccination prohibited; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures
