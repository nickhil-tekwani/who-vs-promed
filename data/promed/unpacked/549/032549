[C] Update 24 - WHO Guangdong China team to issue its report 8 Apr 2003
<http://www.who.int/csr/sarsarchive/2003_04_08/en/>
The WHO expert team in Guangdong Province, China will be issuing its
official interim report and recommendations on the local SARS situation
early tomorrow. The 4-person team, headed by John MacKenzie of Australia,
has been in Guangdong since Thursday 3 Apr 2003. The team was charged to
assess the local situation and to support the strengthening of
surveillance, clinical management, infection control, and laboratory
evaluation of SARS cases.
The team has visited Foshan City, where the earliest case is thought to
have occurred in mid-November 2002, and Guangzhou City, the provincial
capital. In a wide-ranging collaborative investigation, the team has met
with authorities, health and veterinary professionals, and technical
experts in the provincial Centers for Disease Control laboratories and the
virology laboratories of Zongshan Medical University. The team has
conferred with staff at all levels and been granted full access to all
sites, institutes, and hospitals requested.
The team will be reporting on the provincial surveillance system, measures
for community infection control, patient management, and hospital infection
control. It will also give a detailed review of microbiological findings.
The SARS outbreak in Guangdong Province is presently the largest and oldest
known outbreak of SARS and may hold important clues about both the origins
or the virus and measures for clinical management. In one of its earliest
reports about cases of atypical pneumonia to WHO, the Chinese Ministry of
Health reported 305 cases and 5 deaths, from mid-November 2002 to 9 Feb
2003, in 6 municipalities: Foshan, Guangzhou, Heyuan, Jiangmen, Shenzhen,
and Zhongshan.
Guangzhou was the home of a 64-year-old professor of nephrology at
Zhongshan University, who is thought to be the index case who sparked the
outbreak in Hong Kong. During late February 2003, he stayed in room 911 on
the ninth floor of the Metropole Hotel. Guests staying on the hotels ninth
floor sparked outbreaks in other countries when they returned to their
homes in Toronto and Singapore. A 48-year-old American businessman, who
also stayed on the 9th floor, is believed to have originated the outbreaks
in Hanoi and in Hong Kongs Princess Margaret [Hospital], where he was
transferred. One local Hong Kong resident, who visited an acquaintance on
the ninth floor, subsequently sparked an outbreak in a second Hong Kong
hospital.
Elsewhere in China, Shanghai, which has reported its first SARS case, has
requested a visit from the WHO team to discuss SARS and be advised on how
best to deal with the disease.
In Beijing, the death on Sunday of a 53-year-old staff member of the
International Labour Organization continued to cause considerable anxiety,
particularly at embassies and among staff of international organizations.
Epidemiologists at the WHO Office in Beijing have conducted contact tracing
and other investigations to determine the source of the staff members
exposure and to assess whether close contacts may have been exposed. To
date, no SARS cases or suspicious symptoms related to this death have been
observed. The investigations are continuing.
Update on cases and countries
As of today, 2671 SARS cases with 103 deaths have been reported from 17
countries. This represents an increase of 70 cases and 5 deaths when
compared with yesterday. The new deaths were reported in Canada (1), Hong
Kong SAR (2), and Singapore (2). The additional cases were reported in
Canada (1), China (11), Hong Kong SAR (45), France (1), Singapore (7), and
the United States (7). Taiwan, China removed 2 cases from the list.

A total of 138 patients have recovered from atypical pneumonia and have
been discharged from public hospitals. Of them, 11 were discharged today.
Most of the patients currently in hospital are showing positive responses
to the new treatment protocol. 116 patients are receiving treatment in
intensive care units.
2 male patients all with a history of chronic disease died in hospitals
last night, bring to 25 the total number of deaths relating to atypical
pneumonia. The 2 patients, aged 81 and 74, died in Prince of Wales Hospital
and Princess Margaret Hospital, respectively.
The cumulative figure for patients who have been admitted to public
hospitals with atypical pneumonia since 12 Mar 2003 is as follows:
No. cases/ No. discharged cases/ No. deaths*
(The numbers in bracket are those with pneumonia symptoms)
Health care workers of Hospitals/Clinics and medical students 226 (226)/ 69/ 25

There were 5 additional SARS cases reported today. 3 are from SGH Wards 57
and 58 comprising of 2 nurses and a patient. The other 2 additional cases
are a TTSH occupational therapist attached to the TTSH Rehabilitation
Department at the Ang Mo Kio Community Hospital and a visitor to Orange
Valley Nursing Home.
Update on SGH cluster
So far, 46 persons linked to the SGH cluster at Wards 57 and 58 have been
admitted comprising 31 SGH staff, 11 visitors, and 4 inpatients. Of these,

In addition to the 2 nurses from Orange Valley Nursing Home who were
admitted to TTSH as a probable and suspect case, a visitor to the Home has
now been diagnosed as a probable case. She is a MediaCorp staff member who
become unwell on 2 Apr 2003 and was admitted to TTSH on 7 Apr 2003 as a
SARS [patient]. Her condition is stable. She had been on leave from work
since 28 Mar 2003. 5 of her colleagues who visited her during the period
she was on leave have been advised to stay at home and will be receiving
Home Quarantine Orders by the end of today. Her other work collegues will
not be served Home Quarantine Orders, as she was well prior to her starting
her leave.

We read with interest the moderator comment copied below.
[To place these figures in perspective, China (including Hong Kong) has now
reported 69 deaths in 4.5 months. In 122 cities in the USA, with a total
population much less than one quarter of China's population, there have now
been 890 deaths from pneumonia + influenza reported in the 3 months ending
29 Mar 2003 -- see: <http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5213md.htm>
Table III. - Mod.JW]
We believe that the 890 deaths mentioned in the comment actually represents
deaths in one week (week 13) in the U.S. in the 122 cities rather than
during the 3 months ending 29 Mar 2003. Curious, we looked further. Table
32 (page 127) of Health, United States, 2002 indicates that in 1999 there
were 63 730 pneumonia + influenza (P+I) deaths in the U.S., (weekly average
of 1226 deaths). Table 33 (page 132) indicates that of this total, 57 282
P + I deaths occurred in persons over 65 years of age (weekly average 1102
deaths), and therefore 6448 deaths occurred in persons under 65 years of
age (weekly average of 124 deaths). In the 25-44 years age group there
were 1402 deaths caused by P + I in 1999 (weekly average of 27
deaths). These back-of-the-envelope calculations give an even more
striking perspective to numbers of SARS deaths.

From: Steve Toovey <toovey@travelclinic.co.za>

Medinfo reports that the first probable SARS case has been reported in
Pretoria. A 62-year-old gentleman with a recent history of travel to China
was admitted to the Pretoria East hospital on 7 Apr 2003 with symptoms
suggestive of SARS. He was immediately recognised as a potential SARS case
and placed into isolation. He is currently being managed strictly according
to WHO and CDC recommendations.
Definitive virological tests are being conducted at the moment, and the
Department of Health has been informed. Dr Andrew Jamieson of Netcare
Travel Clinics confirmed the admission. The patient is in a critical
condition and is being ventilated.
[ProMED-mail appreciates this first hand report of the first probable case
of SARS in South Africa, and on the African continent. - Mod.MPP
[B] China - Guangdong from Xinhuanet 9 Apr 2003 00:46
AM <http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2003-04/09/content_822052.htm>
According to the provincial health department, Guangdong reported 10 new
cases of the epidemic on 1 Apr 2003 and only one case on 7 Apr 2003. The
average number of cases reported from 1 to 7 April 2003 was 7.57, down
70.2 percent from the same period last month. Currently 82.3 percent of
patients in the province have recovered and left hospital.

[According to the WHO worldwide update, "as of today, 2671 SARS cases with
103 deaths have been reported from 17 countries. This represents an
increase of 70 cases and 5 deaths when compared with yesterday. The new
deaths were reported in Canada (1), Hong Kong SAR (2), and Singapore (2).
The additional cases were reported in Canada (1), China (11), Hong Kong SAR
(45), France (1), Singapore (7), and the United States (7). Taiwan, China
removed 2 cases from the list."
In the Health Canada update [4] there are reports of 3 additional probable
cases since the report contained in the WHO update, and in the CDC data
from the USA [5], there is one additional case since the report to WHO
(because of the time zone differences, these additional cases will appear
in tomorrow's WHO update). In the brief section above [7][A], we have a
report of the first probable case of SARS in South Africa, also
representing the first reported case on the African continent.
The newswire report from China on the daily case count in Guangdong
decreasing is interesting. We look forward to the report from the WHO
team's visit to Guangdong for more detailed information on the epidemiology
of SARS in the 5-month period since its first recognition. - Mod.MPP]
