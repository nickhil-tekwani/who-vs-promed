Working Group; Bulletin 15, 02 Feb 2007, last updated 6 Feb 2007 [edited].

Outbreak period until 1 Feb 2007
--------------------------------
1. Main observations
The bluetongue serotype 8 epidemic started 25 weeks ago, with the case
total now having reached 2124 herds. Of the 2122 cases with accurate
georeferences, 695 cases were reported from Belgium, 7 from France, 952
from Germany, 460 from the Netherlands, and 8 from Luxembourg.
Among the 41 additional cases reported this week 15 pertained to cases
confirmed in the last week whereas the remainder are mainly related to
cases confirmed during the previous 2 weeks. This week's new cases were
reported in cattle and within the area known to be infected. During the
month of January, cases have continued to be reported at a low rate.
Until the end of December new cases were detected either through clinical
case reporting or as a result of serological investigations prior to
movements between zones within member states or between member states.
Since January most of the new cases appear to have been detected as a
result of cross-sectional studies or by serological investigations prior to
movements between zones within member states or between member states.
Hence, most newly reported cases in January are likely to be herds where
the animals became infected several weeks ago. For an evaluation of the
clinical outbreaks it is therefore recommended to consider the data until
the end of December only. These are considered to be based on a relatively
consistent method of outbreak detection.
The purpose of this bulletin was to characterise the epidemic that started
in August 2006 using clinical outbreak data. This task is now considered to
be completed successfully and the weekly reporting will therefore be
discontinued.
2. Experiences gained from the development and implementation of the weekly
BTV8 epidemiological reporting process
The series of 15 epidemiological reporting updates about the BTV8 epidemic
which were published on the EFSA website at about weekly intervals since
the establishment of this working group in October 2006 represents one of
the 2 tasks specified in a request for assistance from the European
Commission to EFSA. For the reasons discussed above and also because the
mandate finished on 31 Jan 2007, the current BTV8 epidemiological is the
last one to be published under this mandate.
A reporting process such as the one adopted here has the potential to be an
information resource for risk managers during transboundary animal disease
outbreaks. Key lessons to be learned from the current experience are:
1. It is possible to perform regular descriptive epidemiological analyses
of an outbreak of a transboundary disease within the EU. The format of the
weekly reports was enhanced during the first 2 months of the period of the
mandate, while data access and standardisation issues were gradually being
resolved. This resulted in being able to include data on the population at
risk at the end of November.
2. The good collaboration among the member states and with the commission
was a key factor for EFSA to be able to carry out this mandate. It
demonstrates the usefulness for EU member states to establish a network of
individuals that are trained to collaborate and mandated to represent each
country in such activities. These individuals need to understand through a
priori exercises the key data sources and be given access to them.
3. There is a need for standardisation of data and other mechanisms that
permits to efficiently combine data from different countries into single
databases for analysis purposes. In particular, data on the spatial
distribution of the population at risk of susceptible animal species
(including small ruminants) need to be readily accessible.

The following data were derived from table 1 of the bulletin, "Number of
cases reported by country and by animal species affected":
country / cattle / small ruminants / wild / mixed / total
Germany / 624 / 302 / 13 / 14 / 952
France / 7 / 0 / 0 / 0 / 7
The Netherlands / 176 / 250 / 0 / 34 / 460
Belgium / 296 / 399 / 0 / 0 / 695
Luxembourg / 8 / 0 / 0 / 0 / 8
Total 1111 / 951 / 13 / 47 / 2122
The 3 striking characteristics of the 2006 BTV-8 outbreak in north western
Europe were its latitude, the significant involvement of
clinically-affected cattle, and its continuation deep into the winter
season. Explanation(s) to these phenomena, expected to be instrumental in
the preparations for a possible return of the disease during the
summer/fall of 2007, might be sought in the undertaken entomological and
virological studies. Available results are anticipated with interest. - Mod.AS]
