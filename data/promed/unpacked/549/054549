Three other children tested positive for diphtheria, following the death of a 2-year-old on [21 Feb 21 2019]. The Health Ministry said all 4 children were living in the same house in Johor Baru. The boy is believed to have died due to complications from the disease.

"As of [Sat 2 Mar 2019], 3 more diphtheria cases have been confirmed. One of the patients is the sister of the victim, aged 4 [years], who lives in the same house. Another 4-year-old boy and a girl, aged 15, who also live in the same house, also tested positive for the disease," the ministry said in a statement. It said all 3 had been given treatment and one of them was allowed to return home.

"A total of 10 other children, with symptoms and living in the same house, were treated but tests conducted on them found that they were not affected by diphtheria," the statement added. Apart from this, the ministry said that 8 other people, living in the same house, did not show any symptoms but were given antibiotics as a preventive measure.

It said those treated would be monitored daily at the Johor Baru Health Office for 14 days, adding that no new cases had been reported.

The death of the toddler, who was not immunised against the disease, led to a public debate on whether immunisation should be made mandatory. On [23 Feb 2019], Health Minister Datuk Seri Dr. Dzulkefly Ahmad said that a law might be tabled in Parliament to make the move compulsory. There were 5 fatal diphtheria cases last year [2018], involving children below 10 [years of age].

Diphtheria is caused by the infection of the bacterium _Corynebacterium diphtheriae_, and symptoms range from fever with sore throat, thick covering in the back of the throat and swollen tonsils. The disease can lead to difficulty breathing, heart failure, paralysis and even death.
