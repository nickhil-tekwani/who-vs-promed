Southern Sudan Measles Outbreak Kills 22 People; 80 Infected
------------------------------------------------------------
At least 22 people died in Southern Sudan after an outbreak of
measles, said Rueben Madit, a Health Ministry official. The
worst-affected area is in Maiwut County in the northeastern Upper
Nile state, Madit said in a telephone interview today [22 Aug 2008]
from Malakal, the state capital. The deaths occurred in the last 4
days and those infected have been admitted to hospital. "We are doing
all we can to eradicate the disease but we are poorly equipped," Madit said.

Health authorities are sending a medical team to the area to carry
out vaccinations in an effort to stop the disease from spreading,
Peter Oganjok, director of Health and Immunization in Upper Nile,
said in a phone interview. An immunization campaign that was supposed
to have been carried out last year [2007] didn't take place because
of heavy rains, he said.

[By 2007 measles deaths in Africa had plunged by 91 percent, and
according to the World Health Organisation (WHO) Africa led the
decline in global measles deaths.

Measles deaths in Africa fell by 91 percent between 2000 and 2006,
from an estimated 396 000 to 36 000, reaching the regional target 3
years early. The spectacular gains achieved in Africa helped generate
a strong decline in global measles deaths which fell 68 percent
during the same time period (see:
<http://www.who.int/immunization_monitoring/diseases/big_measles_map_coverage.jpg>).


The WHO map of immunization coverage with measles containing vaccines
in infants shows that in 2006 immunization coverage in Sudan lagged
behind that in some other regions (see:
<http://www.who.int/immunization_monitoring/diseases/
big_measles_map_coverage.jpg>). The Bloomberg report above suggests
that the measles vaccination momentum in Sudan is becoming difficult
to maintain.
