An outbreak of botulism in Russia
-----------------------------------
5 people were hospitalized with botulism in Komi. The cause of the
intoxication was consumption of domestically prepared canned food.
The cases were reported in Uhta city.

The food was consumed by a family and family friends. After the food
was consumed, 5 people became ill and sought care. Physicians quickly
recognized the infection and injected serum [presumably antitoxin -
Mod.LL].

At the present time, the condition of the infected people is stable.
