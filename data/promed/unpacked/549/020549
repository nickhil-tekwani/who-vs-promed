Cambodia: 2nd Human Case of Avian Influenza Confirmed
--------------------------------------------------------
A 28-year-old Cambodian man has died of avian influenza virus
infection in a hospital in the capital, becoming the country's 2nd
victim of the virus, the health minister said Thu 24 Mar 2005. The
victim came from Kampot province, which borders Viet Nam, and his
village (Tram Sasor) is 20 kilometers away from the home of the 1st
victim, who died in January 2005 after traveling for treatment to
Viet Nam.
"The tests show that the man had H5 [serotype virus]. We sent a
sample on Wed 23 Mar 2005 to France for further confirmation," Health
Minister Nuth Sokhom told Agence France-Presse as he traveled to
Kampot province. The victim died on Tue 22 Mar 2005, he said.
Director of the Pasteur Institute in Phnom Penh, Jean-Louis Sarthou,
told AFP that "it couldn't be anything else except H5N1," and said
that the sample was being sent to France merely as a formality.
The Minister said that between 400 and 500 chickens and ducks had
died in the village, but it was not known whether the deceased, who
worked as a traveling businessman and occasionally went to Viet Nam,
had been in contact with them. He added that 8 people who had been in
contact with the victim had been tested for bird flu but [tested
negative]. Nuth Sokhom said he was traveling to Kampot to help try to
educate people about the disease, which has killed 34 people in
Vietnam and 12 in Thailand. Both countries are neighbors of Cambodia.
Sarthou said that epidemiologists from the Pasteur Institute had been
sent to the village on Thu 24 Mar 2005 to investigate. Hospital staff
in contact with the victim had also tested negative, he said, but
pointed out that experts were still unsure about the exact incubation
period of the bird flu virus.
"There are no other suspected cases in Cambodia," he said, adding
that the new case was not overly alarming. "We've always thought that
if there were cases in the Mekong delta (in Viet Nam) then there
would be more on this side of the border," he said. He noted
monitoring and surveillance in Cambodia had improved dramatically
since 2004. "In the whole of Kampot, even the smaller dispensaries
know what they have to do (if they treat someone with symptoms),
because there have been many visits from health officials," he said.
Yim Voeunthan, Secretary of State at the Ministry of Agriculture,
said more than 600 chickens had died in 6 villages in Kampot in the
last 20 days and a further 100 had been culled on Wed 23 Mar 2005. 8
samples of chickens from the area were being tested and Yim Voeunthan
expected the results to be back later on Thu 24 Mar 2005. "Villagers
were eating the dead chickens even through we warned them not to. Now
the villagers are afraid. They dare not eat chicken anymore," he
said. The transportation of poultry in and out of the district was
banned, he added.
Directors of the 8 Pasteur Institutes from across the Asia-Pacific
region -- Shanghai, Hong Kong, Seoul, Noumea, Ho Chi Minh City,
Hanoi, Nha Trang and Phnom Penh -- were meeting in the Cambodian
capital on Monday. They would work to update and standardize their
diagnosis methods for bird flu, Sarthou said. The World Health
Organization said last week it was working with the health ministry
on a public education campaign to fight bird flu to be funded by 40
000 dollars from the agency. Until now, only 2500 dollars has been
spent on education in the predominantly agricultural kingdom of 13
million people.

[There is no suggestion of onward transmission of H5N1 virus from
this patient. It has not been established whether the deceased
patient contracted infection in Cambodia or during his occasional
business trips to Viet Nam. The geographic proximity of the 1st and
2nd human cases in Cambodia, although separated in time, suggests
that there may be active foci of avian influenza in poultry in this
region of Cambodia. - Mod.CP]
