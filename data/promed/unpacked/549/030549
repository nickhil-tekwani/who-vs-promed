The final results of all tests on dead fish and samples from farms in the Jordan Valley showed that they were free of the herpes virus (KHV), according to the director of the Animal Production Directorate at the Ministry of Agriculture [MOA], Eng Khalil Amro.

Amro told the Jordan News Agency (Petra) today [18 May 2022], that the cause of death of carp on the farms is a fungal infection resulting from the fungal gill rot disease, indicating that it is a treatable fungal disease. The MOA has a management program in this regard and the disease does not constitute a health threat to humans or animals.

It is noteworthy that the symptoms of the infection began 4 days ago [14 May 2022], and that the Ministry of Agriculture has monitored some deaths of carp in specific farms within the Jordan Valley, especially in the Al-Zour areas, which depend in part on water drawn from the Jordan River.

["Gill rot disease", known as branchiomycosis, is a fungal disease in fish farms (mainly in carp farms) affecting the gill epithelium and capillaries. This disease generally causes high fish mortality, being acute in some freshwater fish. It is usually seen in regions with a hot climate. Water temperature, the amount of organic matter, and the high amount of ammonia in ponds fertilized with organic fertilizers are the critical factors that fundamentally influence the prognosis of the disease. The above and additional information is reviewed in: Ozcan F, Arserim NB. Fungal diseases in fish. Black Sea Journal of Agriculture 2022; 5(1): 48-52. https://dergipark.org.tr/en/pub/bsagriculture/issue/65748/983345 (open access).

Unlike most other river valleys, the term "Jordan Valley" often applies just to the lower course of the Jordan River, from the spot where it exits the Sea of Galilee in the north, to the end of its course where it flows into the Dead Sea in the south. The river divides the Kingdom of Jordan on its east, and Israel and West Bank (PA) on its west (map at https://www.researchgate.net/publication/242458111_Water_and_Environmental_Security_in_the_Middle_East/figures?lo=1).

The affected carp farms are located on the eastern (Jordanian) side of the Jordan Valley (in Arabic, Ghor al-Urdun) which forms part of the larger Jordan Rift Valley.

Notably, during the period 1-20 May 2022, the mean daily temperatures measured in the Jordan valley (Zvi meteorological station) were between (minimum) 32.0 deg C and (maximum) 45.0 deg C (89.6 to 113 deg F]; during 10 of the said days, the temperatures were above 35.0 deg C (95 deg F).

Results of the antimycotic treatment, applied according to Jordan's MOA management program, would be appreciated. - Mod.AS
