In response to the moderator's comments, without baseline data prior to the
more extensive human contact, we can not reliably determine if the more
extensive human contact resulted in the diseases being detected in the
orangutan population.
In the case of Hepatitis C, percutaneous exposure to blood from humans
infected with Hepatitis C (or sexual contact with such a person) seems an
unlikely route of transmission. It seems more likely that the disease may
have been impacting the orangutan population for quite some time and only
recently detected with the new testing.

Regarding the posting about the orangutans contracting human diseases, is
there any speculation as to how the orangutan contracted Hepatitis C? Was
it receiving treatment for an illness and injected using contaminated
syringes?
Since many people who have been infected with Hepatitis C don't know how
they acquired in infection, I'm wondering if the route of transmission is
known in this case.
