A young Romanian woman showing bird flu-like symptoms does not have the
disease but merely a common viral infection, doctors said after getting
test results.

The woman had been admitted earlier in the day to the contagious diseases
hospital in Bucharest, hospital director Adrian Streinu-Cercel said. "The
young woman only has an everyday virus," Streinu-Cercel told the national
radio station.

Romanian health authorities are, however, on the hunt for several dozen
tonnes of chicken product produced at a site where bird flu had been found,
triggering fear among consumers.

The deadly H5N1 strain of the flu was found at a farm in Codlea in central
Romania over the weekend and may have contaminated chicken products shipped
to supermarkets. The scare comes as the eastern European country awaits a
decision from Brussels about joining the European Union, with EU officials
already worried about food safety in Romania.

Bird flu has been confirmed at 56 sites in Romania since the disease first
surfaced in October 2005 in the country's Danube delta, but so far there
have been no confirmed cases of it spreading to humans.
