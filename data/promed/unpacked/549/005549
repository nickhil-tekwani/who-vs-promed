----------------------------------------------------------------------
So far in the COVID-19 pandemic, surveillance systems are not monitoring ill health and long-term implications of COVID-19, only deaths are reported. Most are also not tracking all cases, only positive tests are counted. Underestimating the number of cases means inadequate control of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and failure to support those who do not recover quickly from COVID-19. We must universally agree and implement surveillance case definitions for infection and recovery.

Across the world, some people with symptoms of COVID-19 are not being tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection because tests are either not available or inaccessible, particularly in low-resourced contexts. Some people do not seek testing when they experience symptoms of COVID-19 because of worries about income, caring responsibilities, or stigma implications of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 and having to isolate. Some people might test negative, particularly if testing takes place too early or too late in the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection./1 We need to count this wider pool of cases, including people who either test negative or are not tested but fulfill clinical criteria for COVID-19.

The most recent WHO public health surveillance guidance asks countries to report probable cases, in addition to confirmed cases./2 The definition of a probable case of COVID-19 includes someone meeting clinical criteria and who is a contact of a probable or confirmed case, or a suspected case with chest imaging findings suggestive of COVID-19. It is important to consider how such definitions are practically implemented. Despite the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommending in April 2020, to include probable cases in surveillance,/3 many US States do not report these data. Also, existing definitions of a probable case are dependent on interaction with health systems and, thus, might also miss a substantial proportion of people with SARS-CoV-2 infection. This situation can be mitigated by incentivising people with symptoms to approach health care and seek testing, by removing barriers, financial detriments, and the stigma of diagnosis, and by active symptom screening in workplaces or educational settings.

A universal surveillance case definition of recovery from COVID-19 is still absent. Many people have prolonged symptoms, ill health, and reduced functionality for months, even if they were not hospitalised for SARS-CoV-2 infection./4 We must move long-haul COVID from anecdote to something that is routinely quantified and monitored, as is currently being done with deaths and positive tests./5 To make this move, we must count COVID-19 cases beyond positive test statistics. We also need to define recovery, taking into account symptom duration, fluctuation, severity, quality of life, and functionality, and not base this definition solely on testing negative for active SARS-CoV-2 infection or discharge from hospital.

We must measure the proportion of cases with prolonged ill health, not only to provide support and care but also to redefine the true effect of the pandemic and inform the appropriate response to it. We can only capture this information by having infection case definitions that are not entirely based on laboratory confirmation to form the denominator for the recovered cases.

Improving the reporting of non-laboratory-confirmed clinical cases by practically establishing how existing systems can do so is vital. Public health bodies must also universally agree on definitions of what constitutes recovery, to estimate the true burden of ill health associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

I have had prolonged symptoms of COVID-19. I declare no other competing interests.

In conducting outbreak investigations, one usually develops a case definition and further subdivides cases into laboratory confirmed and probable cases. As the author rightly points out, while probable case reports have been requested, many reporting localities have not been submitting these cases. On one hand, it brings up my favorite adage and its corollary -- "seek and ye shall find" or "don't look and it ain't there."

As many probable cases have not come to the attention of the formal health sector, population based serosurveys have been shedding light on the prevalence of antibodies to estimate the additional infection rate not reported through the laboratory confirmed cases system. Under-reporting has been estimated between 10% and 20% in different locations.

The issue about disease burden, especially prolonged disease manifestations, is slowly coming to light through initially anecdotal reports in the media and more recently, publications addressing the prolonged effects. The author is correct that we do not have a good handle as yet on the overall disease burden on the population, including risk factors for prolonged symptoms. What are the risk factors for prolonged complications/sequelae? Who are the vulnerable individuals? How can they be managed clinically? How long do these symptoms persist?

A media report on 27 Aug 2020 submitted by Mary Marshall addresses the issue of expected myalgic encephalomyelitis (chronic fatigue syndrome) following infection with SARS-CoV-2 (Columbia Magazine https://magazine.columbia.edu/article/how-covid-19-could-reveal-secrets-chronic-fatigue-syndrome) with an expectation of approximately 10% following viral infections and well over 25 million confirmed cases), the expected disease burden is high.

[2] USA (CA): chicken processing plant
Date: Fri 28 Aug 2020 23:03

https://www.businessinsider.fr/us/coronavirus-outbreak-workers-closes-foster-farms-chicken-plant-2020-8


A poultry plant in California has been shut down after 358 employees tested positive for the coronavirus and 8 died of the disease. This cluster of cases was reported at a Foster Farms chicken processing facility in Merced County and was described by county health officials as the "most severe and long-lasting outbreak" in the area.

In a statement issued Thursday [27 Aug 2020], the Merced County Department of Health said the number of infected workers is known only because they chose to get screened for COVID-19 and report the positive tests to their employer. "The true spread of COVID-19 in the Foster Farms Livingston Facility remains unknown," officials wrote.

The case fatality rate in Merced County hovers around 1.3%, but it is up to 2.2% at the Foster Farms facility, the health department said. In a statement to Insider, Foster Farms confirmed the death numbers, said it had expanded testing measures in recent weeks, and said it would "complete comprehensive testing" of its Livingston complex Friday [28 Aug 2020].

"Foster Farms has provided Merced County Public Health and the State of California with ongoing testing plans, which would continue to enable the company to effectively screen for COVID-19 in the workforce while maintaining the essential operations that enable us to contribute to the food supply," the company wrote.

According to health officials, the outbreak began as far back as [29 Jun 2020] and prompted trips to the plant, as well as recommendations to curb the infection's spread. Suggestions included "making significant changes to the employee break spaces and performing widespread testing of employees within the facility," Merced County officials said. However, Foster Farms tested less than 100 people -- about 10% -- of the department that was hardest hit through late July [2020].

"Over 25 percent of the employees screened at this time tested positive," the statement continued. "However, expanded testing within the department was not completed for an additional three weeks and subsequently, three fatalities were linked to that department alone."

Despite subsequent directives, "the spread of COVID-19 within the facility has not been contained and active outbreaks continue to exist, posing a significant threat to Foster Farms employees and the surrounding community," health officials said, adding that testing remains insufficient.

The Merced County Health Officer ordered the Foster Farms Poultry Processing Plant to close the facility until it has a handle on the outbreaks and can reopen safely, according to the statement. Merced County officials said they attempted to work with Foster Farms, the State Attorney General's Office, and the California Department of Public Health, but the parties involved couldn't come to an agreement about how to mitigate the cluster of infections and keep the food production facility open. "Our charge is to protect the public's health, even in the face of difficult decisions. The closure of this plant is the only way to get the outbreak at Foster Farms swiftly under control," Dr Salvador Sandoval, Merced County's public health officer, said in the statement.

California Attorney General Xavier Becerra seconded the sentiment, writing: "Foster Farms' poultry operation in Livingston, California has experienced an alarming spread of COVID-19 among its workers. Nobody can ignore the facts: It's time to hit the reset button on Foster Farms' Livingston plant."

[3] Ecuador: reinfection report
Date: Sat 29 Aug 2020 17:45 ECT
Source: El Universo [in Spanish, trans. Mod.MPP, edited]
https://www.eluniverso.com/noticias/2020/08/29/nota/7959514/reinfeccion-ecuador-coronavirus-sars-salud-primer


This Saturday [29 Aug 2020], the Microbiology Institute of the San Francisco University of Quito [USFQ] reported the 1st confirmed case of reinfection with SARS-CoV-2 in the country [Ecuador]. "The genomes of the viruses identified in this Ecuadorian male with COVID-19 in May 2020 and again in August 2020 were sequenced and demonstrated 2 different strains of the virus.

At the beginning of this week (week of 24 Aug 2020), the 1st documented case of reinfection was announced through a study. According to the document, a 33-year-old male resident of Hong Kong, who was hospitalized for COVID-19 on 29 Mar 2020, was positive by PCR on 15 Aug 2020. The young man was probably infected when he was returning to Hong Kong from Spain, via the UK.

On Friday [28 Aug 2020] a new study was published in the USA detailing a subject in Nevada who was positive the 1st time in mid-April 2020, and after recovering returned ill at the end of May 2020. While the scientists mentioned it wasn't clearly reinfection, it wasn't ruled out, given that some people appear to have transient immunity or do not produce antibodies.

Reinfection with the virus in Ecuador
-------------------------------------
Paul Cardenas, a researcher from the Microbiology Institute, explained that the case is a 46-year-old male who after presenting with mild symptoms such as headache, fatigue, among others, tested positive by PCR in May 2020 at the San Francisco University of Quito. Family members also tested positive and as time went by they all recovered.

Another control was done in our laboratory and the PCR was negative. In August [2020] he presented again with other symptoms much more severe this time, in terms of fever, chest pain, cough, and sore throat. He did not require hospitalization, but he was close to needing it; we did a PCR test and it was positive. Obviously, what one always thinks in these cases is that it is the same virus, that the patient's symptoms improved but relapsed. From the 1st to the 2nd illness period there were 81 days, which suggests the return of the same virus is less likely. The only way to know if this virus is different is to compare the 1st infection with the 2nd infection through genomic sequencing," Cardenas explained. The genomic sequencing demonstrated that the person has a new strain of the virus, different from the initial strain. We began to study this during the 1st 2 weeks of August 2020.

"The strains quite different, they belong to 2 groups of viruses that are called clades, or phylogenetic groups, that is to say, based on their DNA sequencing, in this case RNA, they are different, they have various mutations in other sites, it is not the same virus which mutated in the same person", he added [the phylogenetic tree of the viruses can be seen at the source URL above].

No antibody tests were done for this patient during the period in which he was virus free, but currently, he has a high level of IgG. In the case of his family, reinfection could not be confirmed in his wife because complete genome sequences were not possible to obtain from her 1st specimen.

Cardenas explained that it is probable that the 1st infection did not generate an efficient immune response so that the 2nd infection was independent. In addition, one doesn't expect the same levels of transmission experienced in March and April 2020, because reinfection can also be prevented with the use of masks, avoiding crowds, and conducting massive tests.

"It is something expected, but it also means that we need to conduct more investigations into this...we cannot be confident that we are not going to have reinfected individuals or that susceptible persons will not develop serious disease; unfortunately this virus is teaching us all of the time," he indicated

Genomic sequencing
------------------
Since March 2020, the Microbiology Institute of the USFQ began with genomic sequencing of the virus from specimens obtained in hospitals of the capital. At the time, they named the strain hCoV-19/Ecuador/HEE_01/2020, and it was obtained from the 1st positive patient with COVID-19 in Quito -- a 57-year-old Dutch tourist who was in the Eugenio Espejo hospital. After 4 months of work, the number of sequenced genomes rose to 9, from which 6 different strains were detected as circulating in the country until June 2020.

The genome is a set of genes that form a code that contains all the information that is needed to make an organism from scratch. The Institute has collaborations with other universities and hospitals for the extraction of specimens and genome sequencing from other zones of the country such as Canar, Azuay, El Oro, Loja, and Babahoyo.

As of 29 Aug 2020, 52 strains (21 are different) of SARS-CoV-2 have been detected in the country, while in the world there are 4979 genomes identified.

In a Science Magazine report on 14 Jul 2020, https://science.sciencemag.org/content/369/6501/238
(https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/07/pandemic-virus-slowly-mutating-it-getting-more-dangerous) Kai Kupferschmidt discussed the significance (or unknown significance) of observed mutations of the SARS-CoV-2 identified in the 1st 6 months, focusing on the G614 mutation of the spike protein identified by Korber B et al (Korber B, Fischer WM, Gnanakaran S, et al. Tracking changes in SARS-CoV-2 spike: evidence that D614G increases infectivity of the COVID-19 virus. Cell. 2020; 182(4): 812-827.e19; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2020.06.043), suggesting this mutation enhanced the virus cell entry. What was mentioned was how few significant mutations had been identified to date.

What is not clear in a number of the reports of 2nd infections is the true definition of a different clade and what degree of certainty the mutations identified in these 2nd infection reports are in fact from 2 separate infections. As the letter published in The Lancet in section [1] above, there is evidence of prolonged clinical illness in individuals... at what point in time can one clearly identify these are not 2nd infections, or in reverse, that the reported virus variants are in fact 2nd infections?

As is stated by Cardenas in the article above, this virus is teaching us something new on a regular basis. - Mod.MPP]

[These countries were selected on account of having had significant surges of SARS-CoV-2 infections but having responded differently. In some cases, transmission was almost interrupted, but resurgences have occurred, and countries have handled them differently. Lifting of restrictions has led to major resurgences in some areas; in others, early new threats seem to be importations, but community spread does recur. Good contact tracing has helped to shorten the time with new clusters, and temporary new restrictions have had an impact. Countries not implementing restrictions have done more poorly, with major resurgences and more widespread community-based transmission.

In South Korea, it looks like major transmission is continuing, and reported deaths have been increasing as well. Previously, when there were major events, time-limited increased restrictions were implemented, and as of 21 Aug 2020, they are being implemented again. In Italy and Spain, there are major increases in reported cases. The 24-hour positivity rate in the USA is consistent with continued ongoing significant transmission in the community. A key takeaway message is that the virus is still circulating globally, and relaxing of the guard (eliminating simple measures of social distancing, wearing face masks, handwashing, and the avoidance of large gatherings) is an open invitation for the virus to re-enter with clusters of cases and ultimately community transmission. - Mods.MPP/UBA]

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 215.

Data by country, area, or territory for 30 Aug 2020 can be accessed at https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/WHO%20daily%20tablesAug30_1598819826.pdf.

- The Americas region reported 50.0% of daily case numbers and 61.7% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, maintaining its position as the most severely affected region, having reported more than 13.1 million cases. The USA and Brazil still dominate, with Argentina, Colombia, Peru, and Mexico very active as well, as are Chile, Bolivia, Honduras, and Guatemala.

- The European region reported 9.2% of daily case numbers and 5.2% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, and total cumulative cases reported exceed 4.2 million. Spain, Kazakhstan, Belgium, and Sweden did not report any newly confirmed cases to WHO in the past 24 hours so these figures represent weekend artifact with reduced reporting. Among those countries reporting, France dominates followed by Russia, Ukraine, Turkey, Italy, Romania, and the UK.

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 4.5% of daily case numbers and 5.3% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of greater than 1.9 million cases. Iraq still dominates followed by Iran, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, and the Palestinian Authority.

- The African region reported 2.3% of daily case numbers and 5.2% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours and have reported more than one million cases. South Africa reported the highest number of cases in the last 24 hours followed by Ethiopia, Algeria, Nigeria, Namibia, Cote d'Ivoire, Kenya, and Zambia.

- The Western Pacific region reported 1.9% of daily case numbers and 2.4% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of 0.48 million cases. The Philippines continues to dominate, followed by Japan, South Korea, and Australia.

- The South East Asia region reported 32.1% of the daily newly reported cases and 20.2% of reported deaths in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 4.0 million cases. India continues to dominate with reports of over 78 000 cases in the past 24 hours, followed by Indonesia, Bangladesh, and Nepal.

Impression: The overall picture by region is basically the same, taking into account the weekend artifact in reporting.

[The USA, Brazil, and India are still the most severely affected countries in terms of cumulative case counts and daily new case confirmations. In the past 24 hours, these 3 countries -- India (79 457), followed by the USA (34 158), and Brazil (15 346) -- account for over half of all confirmed cases globally (53.8%). 3902 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (29-30 Aug 2020). The marked drops in reported cases and deaths in the past 24 hours are contributed to by weekend reporting artifact, where in some cases countries are not reporting (Spain, Bolivia, or Costa Rica for example) and in other cases, there are marked drops in reported cases and deaths that will rebound later in the week (USA, Brazil).

In descending rank order, India is number one for the number of newly confirmed in the past 24 hours, followed by USA, Brazil, Colombia, Peru, Argentina, France, Russia, Philippines, and Mexico. The range in the top 10 daily newly confirmed goes from 4129 to 79 457. Other hotspots are seen in the countries numbered 11-20 in this list: Iraq, Indonesia, South Africa, Ukraine, Venezuela, Chile, Bangladesh, Iran, the UK and, Turkey, and their range of reported new cases is 1482 to 3731. A total of 25 countries have reported more than 1000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, there is a small change in the average number of daily reported cases (an increase of 2.3%), while daily reported deaths have decreased 3.6%. The key question remains as to whether transmission is in fact slowing down or whether these figures reflect either reporting artifacts seen surrounding weekends or a decrease in reporting.

Impression: Basically unchanged from previous discussions, the SARS-CoV-2 is still actively being transmitted in all regions of the world, and many countries are showing increases in their daily newly confirmed case counts and mortality, while the global 7-day averages seem to reflect a slowing down of reporting confirmed cases; however, I still wonder whether this is real or reflects a changing pattern with decreased testing or case reporting. The European region is seeing increasing cases in western European countries that had markedly reduced transmission in late spring. The most severely affected region is the Americas, with increasing daily case counts, even though the comparative 7-day average suggests things may be slowing down (or reporting is slowing down). India also drives the next most affected region -- South East Asia -- with persistent high daily case reports. - Mod.MPP]
