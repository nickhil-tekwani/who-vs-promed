A hog business in Lambton County [Ontario, Canada] has been linked to a deadly piglet virus. Zantingh Direct Inc. near Wyoming [Lambton County, Ontario, NOT USA] is a clearinghouse or hub for pigs from eastern Canada. Animals head there from suppliers in Ontario, Quebec and the Maritimes, where they're sorted, graded, then sent to meat packers -- predominantly in the US.

On 22 or 23 Jan 2014 animals from an unnamed Middlesex County [Ontario] farm that tested positive for the highly contagious porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) virus arrived at Zantingh, said business manager Brad Zantingh.

The virus does not spread to humans or other animals, but has wreaked havoc in the US, killing millions of pigs -- spreading through pig feces and thriving in cold weather. As of 7 Feb 2014 there were 9 confirmed cases in Ontario -- including cases in Middlesex, Chatham-Kent, Norfolk, Simcoe, Elgin, Perth, and Wellington counties.

The Ministry of Agriculture, after testing, informed Zantingh 25 Jan 2014 that infected Middlesex County swine had arrived on the grounds. The business doesn't breed or slaughter pigs, so the virus hasn't killed any of his stock, he said. He likened the case to patients visiting a hospital emergency room. "You would expect (illness) to be there," he said "Similarly with us, bringing in the virus from other places, we would expect the virus to be here as well."

Pork production accounts for nearly CAD 1 billion a year [about USD 908.1 million] in farmgate sales in Ontario and 10 percent of its agricultural production. Industry representatives have said losses could hit CAD 45 million [about USD 40.9 million] if the disease sweeps across Canada.

Lambton County is the 4th largest producer of pork in Ontario, said Bill Wymenga, an Ontario Pork director representing Lambton County. "We've encouraged our producers to be extra vigilant as far as their biosecurity measures," he said. Knowing the virus has been in Lambton County doesn't change the preventive work already going on, he said.

The province recently pledged CAD 2 million [about USD 1.82 million] to boost biosecurity measures at farms, processors, assembly yards, and other critical points. It's also rolling out a preliminary vaccine that's produced antibodies in pigs.

Zantingh has been working for months to try to mitigate the virus's spread, Brad Zantingh said. That includes constructing a transfer station to prevent cross-contamination between the barn and livestock trailers, separating Canada and USA loading chutes, and even requiring that drivers switch their boots when loading cargo. The business also scrapes out and washes livestock trailers, including disinfecting according to Ontario Swine Health Advisory Board protocol, he said. "It's business as usual with extra steps."
