The sharp fall in prices and substantial decline in production have
reportedly put pepper growers in Wayanad [district of Kerala] in a spot of
bother. Wayanad saw spells of various diseases affecting pepper vines.

"The quick wilt disease is a threat. It had taken its toll on the harvest
in 1995-97 also," according to M Sukumaran, a farmer in Pulpally panchayat
[village].

"We expect a minimum shortage of 2000 tonnes this year [2009] in the
district," said Salu of Cholayil Spices, a wholesale pepper merchant in the
district.

[ref: CR Adkar-Purushothama, et al. First report of a '_Candidatus_
Phytoplasma asteris'-related strain associated with a yellows disease of
black pepper (_Piper nigrum_) in India. BSPP New Disease Reports 2009; 18]
-------------------------------------------------
Black pepper (_Piper nigrum_) yellows is a newly recognized disease in
Coorg (Kodagu) district of Karnataka State in southern India, where pepper
is grown in 10 690 ha [26 416 acres] with a production of 2360 metric
tonnes. Symptoms include yellowing and curling of the leaves. In the
advanced stage, vines become yellow and slender with generalized decline
and reduction in the yield noted (fig. 1).

Based on observation of symptoms, an association of a phytoplasma with the
disease was suspected. Leaf samples from symptomatic and asymptomatic vines
were collected from black pepper plants during December 2007 and January
2008 and assayed for phytoplasma infection. '_Candidatus_ Phytoplasma
asteris'-related strain AAY [American aster yellows] (group 16SrI) and
'_Ca._ Phytoplasma ulmi'-related strain EY1 (group 16SrV) were used as
positive controls. All samples from symptomatic pepper plants along with
positive controls showed 1250 bp [basepair] PCR [polymerase chain reaction]
products, which were absent in asymptomatic samples (fig. 2).

A representative phytoplasmal fragment was sequenced. The 16S rDNA
nucleotide sequence of the phytoplasma identified in yellows-diseased black
peppers [Coorg black pepper yellows (CBPY) phytoplasma] shared more than 99
per cent sequence identity with that of the sugarcane yellows phytoplasma
type I, and more than 98 per cent with those of other related strains
including AAY. Moreover, CBPY phytoplasma showed 98 per cent of identity
with the BPP phytoplasma, previously associated with phyllody of black
pepper in India [see link below].

To our knowledge, this is the 1st molecular evidence for the association of
a phytoplasma with a yellows disease of black pepper, and the
identification of a '_Ca._ Phytoplasma asteris'-related strain associated
with such disease in India.

[Quick wilt (also called foot rot) of black pepper (_Piper nigrum_) is
caused by the fungus _Phytophthora capsici_. It is considered the most
serious threat to this crop in India and a yield decline of 75 per cent has
been reported in some instances. It affects leaves and vines, but once
roots are affected the plant wilts and dies within a month. The fungus is
spread by splashing rain and mechanical means. It has a very wide host
range and therefore a large pathogen reservoir making it difficult to
control. Disease management includes fungicides, biocontrol, use of disease
free and resistant cultivars, and cultural practices. For more information
see previous ProMED-mail post no. 20070807.2565 and links listed below.

Both phyllody (aberrant leaf formation) and yellowing are common symptoms
of phytoplasma infection. However, the term 'yellows' being descriptive of
symptoms is also used for slow wilt and other nematode diseases of black
pepper (see link below). In 2006, a phytoplasma was detected in black
pepper with phyllody symptoms in India and characterised. It was found to
belong to the large _Ca._ P. asteris (16SrI) species group and has been
classified as a species, Black pepper phyllody phytoplasma (BPP). Sugarcane
yellows phytoplasma type I (SYP-I), on the other hand, is an as yet
unclassified species. The new pepper yellows phytoplasma is described as
closely related to both BPP and SYP-I, and it appears that more information
may be needed for the final classification of these species.
