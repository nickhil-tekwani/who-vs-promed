Alberta Sustainable Resources is issuing this as a Correction: replaces
December 11 news release distributed in error this afternoon

Alberta is now about half-way through testing for its 2006-07 chronic
wasting disease (CWD) surveillance program. Three more cases of CWD in wild
deer have been confirmed out of the 1609 deer tested. This brings the total
to 16 cases in wild deer in Alberta since the first case in September 2005.

The 3 new cases involve deer taken during the recent hunting season in
areas being monitored for the disease by Sustainable Resource Development,
Fish and Wildlife staff. A male mule deer from along the Red Deer River
(wildlife management unit [WMU] 151) tested positive for the disease. Two
female mule deer were taken west of Edgerton and south of Chauvin (in WMU 234).

One of these animals came from near previously known Alberta cases. The
other 2 came from a high-risk area near Saskatchewan where positive wild
and farmed deer have been found. Two of these latest cases were confirmed 8
Dec 2006, and the 3rd (near Chauvin) on 20 Dec.

Hunters and landowners have played a critical role in the success of the
CWD control program. Many Alberta hunters have participated in the quota
hunts, and landowners have allowed additional hunting on their property.
Most seasons are closed now in the target areas, with the final license
season ending on 15 Jan 2007.

Hunters are reminded that submitting deer heads is a requirement in 5
wildlife management units along the Alberta/Saskatchewan border. These
include WMUs 150, 151, 234, 256, and 500. Any heads taken in these areas
and kept frozen since the animal was shot can still be dropped off at a
Fish and Wildlife office or at one of the 24-hour freezers. Maps and
information are posted at <http://www.srd.gov.ab.ca/fw/diseases/>.

Chronic wasting disease affects the nervous system; infected animals cannot
maintain weight and slowly waste away. There is no scientific evidence to
suggest that CWD can infect humans. As a precaution, the World Health
Organization advises against allowing products from animals known to be
infected with CWD into the human food system. The 3 hunters have been
contacted and were offered various alternatives including a replacement tag
or replacement meat.
