LETHBRIDGE, Alta. -- Doug Viera of the University of Manitoba was quoted as
telling the international beef symposium in Lethbridge Jan. 6-9 that recent
tests show there's a greater chance that _E. coli_ Ol57:H7 will show up in
lightweight cattle entering a feed lot. Also recently weaned, they may be
stressed with a diet change. It appears that a high energy feed like barley
may make some animals more susceptible, adding that more detailed studies
on dairy herds are ongoing to see why _E. coli_ contamination is higher in
that sector.
The newspaper reports one published study of feedlot cattle showed 63
percent of feedlots had at least one animal testing positive for _E. coli_
in gastrointestinal systems. But the incidence of them passing it in their
manure was low. A cow/calf study from Washington state showed 16 percent of
herds carried the bacteria but less than one percent shed it.
_E. coli_ appears to be a seasonal problem. One British study showed there
was a higher percentage of cattle shedding _E. coli_ in their feces in
April and May. In Canada, a similar study showed more incidents occurred in
May to July, which is also barbecue season, according to Doug Viera.
