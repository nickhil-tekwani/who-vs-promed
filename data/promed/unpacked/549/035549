China reports year's 2nd fatal case of bird flu
--------------------------------------
A man in southwestern China has died of bird flu [avian A(H5N1) virus infection], health authorities said Saturday [?], becoming the 2nd fatality from the H5N1 virus this year.

The 31-year-old died in hospital in the city of Guiyang on Friday [?], the Guizhou province health department said in a statement, adding that no other human cases of avian flu had been reported in the province. Another city resident, a 21-year-old woman, died from the virus earlier this month. The Xinhua news agency said both of them had come into close contact with birds but it was not known if the cases were related.

The World Health Organisation's figures show that China saw 25 deadly cases of the virus between 2003 and 2009 before numbers tailed off to one fatality in each of the 3 following years. The deadliest year of the past decade in China saw 8 deaths in 2006.

China is considered one of the nations most at risk from bird flu epidemics because it has the world's biggest poultry population and many chickens in rural areas are kept close to humans. China has in the past been accused of covering up the extent of bird flu outbreaks, exacerbating fears when new cases are reported. Separate outbreaks among birds were reported last year in the northern region of Ningxia and the remote northwestern region of Xinjiang, prompting massive culls of chickens.

[On 10 Feb 2013 [See ProMED-mail post archived as: "Avian influenza, human (09): Cambodia, Egypt, China, WHO, Archive Number: 20130219.1549714"], the WHO reported 2 new human cases of influenza A(H5N1) virus infection. Both remained in critical condition. The cases come from the same province but do not seem to be epidemiologically linked. Neither had documented contact with sick or dead poultry. Contact tracing and follow up was ongoing but no additional cases had been identified. The last previous official report of A(H5N1) in poultry in mainland China was from Guangdong Province in September 2012.

It s presumed that this AFP report is communicating the deaths of these 2 seriously ill patients. Clarification is awaited.
