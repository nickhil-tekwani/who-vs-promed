[As mentioned previously, this website is constantly updated as new information comes in, so it is likely that when you read this post, the numbers will not match the linked numbers because they will have been updated since the post was prepared.

According to the data on the Johns Hopkins website, the total number of cases of COVID-19 worldwide is now 113 605, with 80 754 cases reported by mainland China. There are now a total of 32 851 confirmed cases of COVID-19 reported from 110 countries/locations outside mainland China, representing an increase of 3573 cases reported in the past 24 hours, with Italy accounting for 1797 of the newly reported cases, Iran for 595 of newly reported cases, and South Korea for 96 of newly reported cases. There are 17 other countries experiencing increases of more than 10 cases: Spain, 400; Germany, 136; USA, 58; Netherlands, 56; Denmark, 55; UK, 48; Sweden, 45; Belgium, 39; Switzerland, 37; Norway, 29; Austria, 27; Malaysia, 18; Australia, 15; Indonesia, 13; Canada, 13; Bahrain, 10; and Philippines, 10. A global total of 4012 deaths have been reported, 876 outside mainland China.

France reported no new cases in the past 24 hours. It would not be surprising if there was a major jump in reported cases tomorrow. The other very notable drop in reported cases is in South Korea.

For the 12th consecutive day, more cases have been reported from outside mainland China than within mainland China. - Mod.MPP]

[According to the report above, a total of 80 754 cases of confirmed COVID-19 have now been reported from China, representing an increase of 19 cases in the past 24 hours, of which 17 (89.5%) were in Hubei province. It is the 3rd consecutive day that the number of newly reported cases in a 24 hour period was less than 50. Daily case counts less than 20 were last reported in mid-January 2020 when the conclusion was there still had not been person-to-person transmission identified (see Novel coronavirus (04): China (HU), Thailand ex China, WHO 20200114.6889527, section [3] for discussion). While there are still suspected cases reported that presumably are waiting for laboratory confirmation, fingers are crossed this adequately represents China approaching interruption of transmission of the SARS-CoV-2. In addition, 17 deaths were reported, all of them by Hubei province. One new case was reported from Hong Kong.

Of note is the increasing numbers of imported cases mentioned with 2 newly imported cases (1 in Beijing, 1 in Guangdong), bringing the total number of imported cases to 69. If the imported cases are counted in the daily totals, then 10.5% of the newly confirmed cases mentioned in today's (9 Mar 2020) update were imported cases. A challenge will be to prevent importations from starting new chains of transmission.

[Note that the reporting interval is now midnight to midnight, presenting the full calendar day. In the past 24 hours, the tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea has increased by 131 cases and 3 deaths. The epicenter of this outbreak is still Daegu province with 5663 reported cases and the surrounding province of Gyeongbuk with 1117 reported cases. Provinces reporting near or more than 100 cases include Gyeonggi (163). Seoul (141), Chungnam (104) and Busan (96).
In the past few days, there appears to be a decreasing trend for daily newly confirmed cases:
29 Feb 2020 813 newly confirmed cases,
7 Mar 2020 483 newly confirmed cases,
8 Mar 2020 367 newly confirmed cases,
9 Mar 2020 248 newly confirmed cases,
10 Mar 2020 131 newly confirmed cases.
Hopefully, this is will continue and South Korea will be following in China's footsteps in terms of slowing down transmission in the country.

[The tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy is now 9172, including 463 deaths, up from 7375 cases and 366 deaths reported on 8 Mar 2020. Cases continue to be concentrated in Lombardy (5469), the epicenter of the outbreak, Emilia-Romagna (1386), and Venice (744), all in the northern part of the country. Italy is a major tourist point, Lombardy is a major commercial hub, and Italians themselves are highly mobile and travel throughout Europe and the Americas. See section [4] below for imported cases from Italy to other countries in Europe and in other regions, a sign of this mobility.

48 hours ago, Italy announced a lockdown for the northern provinces where the outbreak was concentrated. In the past 24 hours, Italy has announced plans to extend the lockdown country-wide. See section [5] below for more details.

C. Iran: 7161 cases, 237 deaths
Date: Tue 10 Mar 2020
Source: The Jordan Times, Agence France-Presse (AFP) report [edited]
http://www.jordantimes.com/news/region/iran-announces-43-new-coronavirus-deaths-raising-toll-237


Iran on Monday [9 Mar 2020] announced 43 new deaths from [COVID-19 disease] in the past 24 hours, bringing the overall toll to 237 dead, one of the world's highest. "Our colleagues have confirmed 595 new cases across the country," health ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour told a news conference. "This brings the overall number of confirmed cases to 7161 as of today noon [10 Mar 2020]," he said. Jahanpour said the rate of new infections was slowing but it was "still too early to judge" when the outbreak could be brought under control. "43 people have unfortunately been added to the number of those who have died of the disease, so to date, we have 237 dead," he said.

Iranian media said a politician and a high-ranking cleric were among the latest fatalities. Mohammadreza Rahchamani, a reformist politician and sitting MP from 1984 to 2000, died on Monday [9 Mar 2020], state news agency IRNA [Islamic Republic News Agency] said. Another prominent victim was Ayatollah Reza Mohammadi Langeroudi, 91, a student of the Islamic republic's late founder Ayatollah Khomeini, Entekhab website reported.

The outbreak of the virus in Iran is one of the deadliest outside of China, where the disease originated.

With 1945 cases, the capital Tehran remains the province with the most cases. The 2nd worst-hit province with 712 confirmed cases is Qom, the Shiite pilgrimage city south of Tehran where the Islamic republic's 1st cases were reported, followed by Mazandaran in the north with 633. The latter is a popular tourist spot bordering the Caspian Sea, especially during holidays for the Iranian New Year on [20 Mar 2020].

Iran is yet to officially impose quarantines but authorities have repeatedly advised against travelling. In certain provinces including Mazandaran, the police have announced that non-residents will be denied entry. According to Iranian media, authorities in several provinces have ordered the closure of hotels and other tourist accommodations in a bid to discourage travel.

State television has also started airing educational programmes for elementary school students after schools were closed until the end of the Iranian year.

Apart from the direct fatalities, 27 people have died from methanol poisoning in Iran after rumours that drinking alcohol can help cure the disease.

Stop all movement. Schools closed until [3 Apr 2020], suspension of all sporting events, including football leagues. "From today Italy will be a protected area; the measures already foreseen by the Dpcm equivalent to a presidential executive order in the USA] of last [8 Mar 2020] will be valid on the whole national territory." The new provision was announced by Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte at a press conference on the evening of [9 Mar 2020].

The text, after the signature of the President of the Conte Council, will be published in the Official Journal and the new measures will be operational as early as [10 Mar 2020].

"We are aware of how difficult it is to change our habits. But unfortunately, there is no time. The numbers tell us of an important increase in infections, hospitalizations in intensive care, and deaths. The closeness of all Italians goes to their loved ones. Our habits must be changed now. We must all give up something for the good of Italy, and we must do it immediately. We will take stronger measures to contain the advance of the coronavirus as much as possible, and to protect the health of all citizens," explained the premier.

"I am about to sign a measure that I could define as follows: #iorestoacasa. There will no longer be "red zone" or "zone 1 and zone 2", there will only be Italy protected area. Therefore, movements throughout the national territory will be avoided unless they are required by reasons of work, necessity, or health. We will extend all the measures already provided for by the Prime Ministerial Decree of last [8 Mar 2020] throughout the national territory. Furthermore -- concluded Conte -- we also add a ban on gatherings both outdoors and in closed rooms. I am forced to take decisive action to protect everyone's health and in particular that of the most fragile."

[As I mentioned in yesterday's update (20200309.7066281), the public health world is watching Italy to see if they are successful in implementing these new rules, and to see if the implementation of these rules will have an impact on disease transmission. I suspect many of the European countries are weighing the pros and cons of implementing similar measures. As are countries in North America.

The Chinese appeared to have successfully slowed transmission of the SARS-CoV-2, there were only 19 cases confirmed in the past 24 hours. Is it feasible and will it work outside of China? - Mod.MPP]

COVID-19, US at a glance*:
Total cases: 423
Total deaths: 19
States reporting cases: 35 (includes District of Columbia)

*Data include both confirmed and presumptive positive cases of COVID-19 reported to CDC or tested at CDC since [21 Jan 2020], with the exception of testing results for persons repatriated to the United States from Wuhan, China and Japan. State and local public health departments are now testing and publicly reporting their cases. In the event of a discrepancy between CDC cases and cases reported by state and local public health officials, data reported by states should be considered the most up to date.

COVID-19: Cases in the United States reported to CDC*
Travel-related: 72

In the event of a discrepancy between CDC cases and cases reported by state and local public health officials, data reported by states should be considered the most up to date.

- CDC is no longer reporting the number of persons under investigation (PUIs) that have been tested, as well as PUIs that have tested negative. Now that states are testing and reporting their own results, CDC's numbers are not representative of all testing being done nationwide.

- As of 8 Mar 2020, 1707 patients had been tested at CDC. This does not include testing being done at state and local public health laboratories, which began this week.

[There is an epidemic curve by date of onset of illness at the source URL above. The major increase in reported cases started between 17-20 Feb 2020, and is continuing. As with other locations around the world, the countries seem to go through a "seek and ye shall find" stage after recognizing there is ongoing local transmission. If you look at the tables of case counts and type of transmission in the WHO situation update, there are countries that are frozen in "imported cases", in many instances testing travellers from outside of their countries, before they recognize they have ongoing transmission in the country. That situation somewhat applies in the USA, where testing was restricted to individuals coming from China or had known epidemiologic links to other confirmed cases. Once a clinically compatible case without identifiable epidemiologic links to other cases was identified, the rush to test based on clinical grounds rather than epidemiologic grounds started, and states are seeking and finding cases.

There is a caveat on the CDC website referring people to the individual state websites for the most up to date figures. An example of the differences, in the table above, New York is shown to have 40 confirmed cases. The following information comes from the NY State Department of Health Coronavirus webpage https://health.ny.gov/diseases/communicable/coronavirus/;

Data last updated 11:15 am 9 Mar 2020
County: no. of positive cases
Westchester County: 98
Nassau County: 17
Rockland County: 4
Saratoga County: 2
Suffolk County: 1
Ulster County: 1
New York State (Outside of NYC): 123
New York City: 19
Total Positive Cases (Statewide): 142

Conclusion: the number of cases will probably continue to rise at a rapid rate, just reflecting the identification of cases once the suspected case definition for testing was changed. A result of a change from "don't look and it isn't there" to "seek and ye shall find."

[7] Selected media report of interest: Nigeria identifies 2nd case
Date: Tue 10 Mar 2020
Source: The Punch [edited]
https://punchng.com/nigeria-records-second-coronavirus-case-buhari-raises-panel/


The Minister of Health, Dr Osagie Ehanire, on Monday [9 Mar 2020], confirmed a 2nd case of coronavirus in the country. The Federal Government moved to stop the spread of the disease as the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), set up a 12-man Presidential Task Force for the Control of Coronavirus-19. The virus was brought into Nigeria by an Italian who arrived in Lagos on [24 Feb 2020] from Milan on a Turkish Airlines flight.

Addressing a press conference at the University of Benin Teaching Hospital, Benin, Ehanire said, "the new contact is a victim who had contact with the Italian who imported it to Nigeria". He said 40 people in Ogun State and 20 others in Lagos who had contact with the Italian had been quarantined.

The minister said the Federal Government had so far committed about N1bn [about USD 2.7 million] to monitoring and preventing the spread of the disease. Osagie said, "Contact tracing and monitoring in respect of the coronavirus index case presently receiving treatment in Lagos have been diligently and conscientiously pursued since [27 Feb 2020] when the case was first diagnosed. "40 persons in Ogun and 20 in Lagos are under isolation and have remained free of any symptoms since then.

"Nevertheless, the Ministry of Health, following best practices, decided to test these persons for the possible presence of coronavirus in their systems. On [8 Mar 2020], scientists confirmed the presence of coronavirus in one of the contacts. "It is my duty, therefore, to announce the new case of coronavirus disease in Nigeria and the newly confirmed case is an Ogun State contact of the index case, but he has no significant clinical symptoms. "This brings the number of COVID-19 cases in Nigeria today to 2."

Osagie said a team of researchers from institutions in the country led by scientists from the Nigerian Institute of Medical Research, Lagos, had successfully perform "the genome sequencing of the coronavirus strain that the index case brought to Nigeria some time ago and the scientists proved it to match with the coronavirus circulating in Italy and Wuhan, China. "It is the 1st time this sequencing virus has been performed in Africa; the result has been shared with international authorities in China and the Director General of the WHO has extended congratulations to Nigerian scientists for this achievement."

The presidential task force is chaired by the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Mr Boss Mustapha. A State House statement by Buhari's media aide, Garba Shehu, announced the appointment on Monday [9 Mar 2020]. Shehu said, "Given the current global outbreak of the novel Coronavirus and its potential of causing significant disruption to health services in the country as well as impacting negatively on the economy, President Muhammadu Buhari has established a Presidential Task Force for the Control of the Coronavirus-19 Disease.

"This action is in preparation for the unlikely but probable major outbreak of the disease in the country which will require a multi-sectoral inter-governmental approach as advised by the World Health Organisation similar to that adopted for the HIV epidemic in the last 2 decades." The committee has a mandate of 6 months to deliver on the assignment. The National Coordinator of the committee is Dr Sani Aliyu. Other members are Minister of Health, Osagie Ehanire; Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola; Minister of Aviation, Hadi Sirika; Minister of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Services, Sadiya Umar-Farouk; Minister of Education, Adamu Adamu; Minister of Environment, Mohammed Mahmoud; Director General, Department of State Services, Yusuf Bichi; Director General, Nigeria Centre for Disease Control; Chikwe Ihekweazu; and World Health Organisation Country Representative.

[As a reminder, in 2014, Nigeria was able to interrupt transmission of ebolavirus following an importation of a case from Liberia that resulted in 19 additional cases in the country. An assessment of the success identified a rapid identification of the index case (arrival from a country with ongoing ebolavirus transmission, intense and rapid contact tracing of all contacts of the index case with isolation of infected secondary cases, and continuous monitoring of all contacts. Essentially analogous to the actions described in the media report above about the country's actions with respect to rapid identification of an index case of COVID-19, isolation of the case, identification, monitoring and testing contacts, and rapid identification and isolation of a contact found to be infected with the virus. The genome sequencing performed in the laboratory is also impressive and speaks to the quality of the laboratory network available in Nigeria. The Nigeria CDC is a formidable presence in West Africa. - Mod.MPP]

Subject in focus: Operations Supply and Logistics (OSL)
-------------------------------------------------------
WHO Operations Supply and Logistics (OSL) continues to support COVID-19 emergency operations where global demand for critical items continues to outpace global supply.

WHO continues to highlight the need for prioritization of personal protective equipment (PPE) supplies for frontline healthcare workers. To help make supplies available, OSL and partners in the Pandemic Supply Chain Network (PSCN) have agreed on mechanisms to secure global warehousing for donated COVID-19 emergency supplies.

OSL is also working with ventilator and respirator equipment manufacturers to develop technical guidance for oxygen therapy and related equipment in the context of COVID-19.

Together with WFP, UNICEF, and the World Bank, OSL continues to work on a proposal for a Supply Chain Coordination Cell to support the UN Crisis Management Team with improved information and coordination to support strategic guidance, operational decision-making, and overall monitoring.

Since the beginning of the outbreak, OSL has shipped more than 584 000 surgical masks, 47 000 N95 masks, 620 000 gloves, 72 000 gowns, and 11 000 goggles to 57 countries.

OSL has also shipped laboratory tests to more than 120 countries to facilitate COVID-19 testing,

In cooperation with the International Humanitarian City (IHC) in Dubai and with aircraft provided by the government of the UAE, OSL organized a flight from Dubai to Iran on [2 Mar 2020], to support the 1st delivery of emergency PPE [personal protective equipment] and lab tests.

In collaboration with WHO Health Operations, an Intensive Care Unit-assessment form is being finalized in order to facilitate independent assessment of ICUs and identify existing supplies to support COVID-19 response activities.

*The designations employed and the presentation of the material in this publication do not imply the expression of any opinion whatsoever on the part of WHO concerning the legal status of any country, territory, city or area or of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers or boundaries. Dotted and dashed lines on maps represent approximate border lines for which there may not yet be full agreement.
**Case classifications are based on WHO case definitions for COVID-19.
***Transmission classification is based on WHO analysis of available official data and may be subject to reclassification as additional data become available. Countries/territories/areas experiencing multiple types of transmission are classified in the highest category for which there is evidence; they may be removed from a given category if interruption of transmission can be demonstrated. It should be noted that even within categories, different countries/territories/areas may have differing degrees of transmission as indicated by the differing numbers of cases and other factors. Not all locations within a given country/territory/area are equally affected.

Terms:
- Community transmission is evidenced by the inability to relate confirmed cases through chains of transmission for a large number of cases, or by increasing positive tests through routine screening of sentinel samples.
- Local transmission indicates locations where the source of infection is within the reporting location.
- Imported cases only indicates locations where all cases have been acquired outside the location of reporting.
- Under investigation indicates locations where type of transmission has not been determined for any cases.
- Interrupted transmission indicates locations where interruption of transmission has been demonstrated (details to be determined).

****"Territories" include territories, areas, overseas dependencies, and other jurisdictions of similar status

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 outside China continues to grow and now totals 104. This includes 9 countries from the Western Pacific region, 49 countries (including 2 territories) from the European region, 8 countries from the Southeast Asia region, 16 countries (including 1 territory) from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 16 countries (including 4 territories) from the Americas region, and 6 countries from the African region. 58 countries/territories are listed as having local transmission within their countries, with Chile, Costa Rica, Bahrain, Iraq, and Cameroon newly reporting local transmission. Local transmission and clusters of cases were also noted on the cruise ship that was quarantined in Japan (the Diamond Princess) and the cruise ship on the Nile in Egypt.

The total number of cases reported from outside of China is now 28 674 including 686 deaths.

A somewhat repetitive but necessary reminder: it is clear that the number of reported confirmed cases differs from different reporting websites and is somewhat a function of time of day the website is updated. For example, I note the time I've accessed the Johns Hopkins website, but by the time the post is actually finished with the editing process, those numbers have at times significantly changed. Case counting is clearly a moving target, and, depending upon when the website updates, the numbers may be different. I try to start each post with the latest figures for the calendar day (the Hopkins table) and close with the figures from the start of the calendar day (the WHO tables), defining the calendar day as DST (now GMT-4). - Mod.MPP]
