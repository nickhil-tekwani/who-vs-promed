BTV-6 Netherlands
-----------------
We would like to keep you informed about the testing that we have
carried out here at the bluetongue community reference lab (CRL) on
the samples from the Netherlands.

We received 3 samples in the lab, sent from the National Reference
Laboratory in the Netherlands, on Wed 22 Oct 2008. We immediately set
the samples up for virus isolation on embryonated hens eggs and
insect cells. We also immediately set up serum neutralisation tests
(SNTs) against all 24 serotypes of bluetongue virus (BTV).

We then tested the 3 samples with our group-specific PCR (Shaw et al,
2007) which detects BTV RNA from representatives of all 24 serotypes.
BTV viral RNA was detected in all 3 samples with Cts of 26, 28 and 30
[* see footnote]. We then tested the samples with both a BTV-8 and a
BTV-1 specific real-time PCR (LSI, France) and detected viral RNA
specific for BTV-8 in one of the samples but, rather worryingly, no
BTV-8 viral RNA was detected in the other 2 samples. No viral RNA
specific for BTV-1 was detected in any of the 3 samples.

[* The Ct value -- or threshold cycle -- is the PCR cycle at which a
statistically significant increase of the fluorescence signal is 1st
detected. Ct values form the basis for quantitative comparison of
individual PCR reactions. The smaller the Ct value, the bigger the
quantity of target cDNA in a given PCR reaction. Eg PCR tutorial at
<http://pathmicro.med.sc.edu/pcr/realtime-home.htm>. - Mod.AS]

The samples were then tested with a gel-based serotype-specific PCR.
This assay, developed by Peter Mertens and Sushila Maan here at
Pirbright, is designed from VP-2 to detect the 24 serotypes of
bluetongue using a panel of serotype-specific primers. One of the 3
samples (the one that gave a Ct of 26 on the 'group-specific' assay)
gave an amplified product of the correct size with 2 bluetongue
serotype 6 (BTV-6) specific primers. This sample was then checked
again by PCR with a further 4 BTV-6 specific primers and products of
the correct size were again amplified. The products amplified with
the 6 BTV-6 specific primers were then sequenced and the sequences
aligned with other BTV-6 sequences in our database. The
serotype-specific PCRs and sequencing was carried out in the
Arbovirology Research group here at IAH Pirbright which is run by
Professor Peter Mertens.

These results indicate that VP-2 viral RNA specific for BTV-6 was
present on one of 3 samples from the Netherlands. Ongoing tests are
being carried out on the remaining 2 samples.

It is important to note that testing is still ongoing on these
samples and we will be working over the weekend [25-26 Oct 2008] and
into next week to see if we are able to confirm the presence of BTV-6
in the remaining 2 samples. Next week we hope we will have
successfully managed to isolate the virus from these samples and,
immediately this is confirmed, we will be able to confirm the
presence of BTV-6 in the isolated samples and carry out further more
detailed sequencing which will shed more light on what we are dealing
with. Also next week we should obtain the results from the serum
neutralisation test (SNT) that we set up against all 24 BTV
serotypes. This was set up with sera from the same animal that was
serotype-specific PCR positive for BTV-6. This assay however may be
complicated by the fact that this animal was vaccinated against BTV-8.

We will of course keep everybody informed immediately we obtain these
confirmatory results.

[Dr. Oura, Prof. Mertens and their colleagues at the CRL, IAH are
congratulated for their remarkable achievement in the swift
identification of the new virus from the Netherlands and commended
for their exemplary transparency. The final results of the laboratory
studies, including the outcome of the tests of the 2 remaining
isolates, are anticipated with interest.

Following the identification of an exotic BTV serotype in Eastern
Netherlands, epidemiological investigations should be carried out to
try trace back recent animal movements from the affected
farms/vicinity to other areas within and outside the Netherlands. The
German authorities are expected to apply similar animal movement
restrictions and enhanced surveillance on their side of the border,
within 50 km (31 miles) of the infected farms. - Mod.AS

Very interesting results. The characterization of one of the 3
isolates as a serotype 6 virus is convincing. VP2 is the neutralising
antigen determinant, so the PCR data may be more definitive than the
pending neutralisation tests using sera from BTV-8 vaccinated
animals. - Mod.CP]
