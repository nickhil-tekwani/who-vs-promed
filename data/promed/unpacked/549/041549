More international support for vaccination
-------------------------------------------
An international conference on animal disease control held in Brussels
concluded today [16 Dec 2004] that there is growing international support
for vaccinating animals during outbreaks of infectious animal disease. The
conference conclusions were presented to Director-General Bergkamp of the
Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality and Deputy
Director-General Husu-Kallio of the European Commission's Health and
Consumer Protection Directorate.
The conference also concluded that the products of vaccinated animals
should not be labeled to distinguish them from other products; that
livestock farmers and other stakeholders share responsibility for disease
prevention and dealing with problems in marketing the products of
vaccinated animals; and that new financing schemes, such as insurance and
contingency funds, should be stimulated at the European level.
Minister Veerman, who opened the conference on Wednesday [15 Dec 2004], is
satisfied with the conference conclusions, which will be discussed by the
European agriculture ministers at the December 2004 Agriculture Council.
At the close of the conference, the Commission announced the launch of a
Technology Platform for Global Animal Health. The platform is an
industry-driven partnership covering the whole chain, from research and
innovation to delivery of new vaccines and tests.

EU must lose fears over vaccinated meat - minister
-----------------------------------------------
European consumers must overcome fears over eating meat from vaccinated
animals if mass slaughter of livestock affected by disease is to be
avoided, Dutch Agriculture Minister Cees Veerman said on Wednesday [15 Dec
2004].
EU countries have seen several outbreaks of highly contagious animal
diseases in recent years, such as bird flu, foot-and-mouth disease and
classical swine fever, which have led to widespread slaughter of livestock
to stop the problem from spreading.
Britons witnessed grisly television images of thousands of burning animals
during the UK's 2001 foot-and-mouth crisis, causing a public outcry and
demands for a rethink of how the government should handle any future outbreak.
"Mass slaughter is no longer politically acceptable," Veerman told a 2-day
conference on animal disease control. "(The question is over) opting for
vaccination instead of wholesale slaughter...but it's difficult to market
meat products from vaccinated animals. These products are often rejected."
Europe faced a dilemma, he said, with trade interests on the one hand and
public opinion on the other. "We have to find a way to get the products of
vaccinated animals on the market," he said. "I see a key role for the
retail sector here; they have a public responsibility." Scientists saw no
danger from vaccinated animals, with no risks of diseases being transmitted.
Veerman last year [2003] ordered the slaughter of more than 30 million
birds -- a quarter of all Dutch poultry -- to contain a bird flu outbreak.
More work could be done to limit the risk of animal disease outbreaks in
Europe, but the threat of infection could not be avoided, he said.
"Massive culling is not acceptable to European citizens anymore, but there
may be situations where it cannot be avoided," Jaana Husu-Kallio, Deputy
Director-General of the European Commission's food safety unit, told the
conference. "The key word is prevention: it's cheaper and more effective.
There won't be a day when we can say there is no risk of a crisis
situation. But we are well prepared," she said.
