The UK has reported 24 cases of salmonellosis linked to travel on cruise ships. The _Salmonella_ Enteritidis cases are from cruise ships visiting destinations in the eastern Mediterranean and Middle East. The outbreak was detected through whole genome sequencing (WGS) analysis. They have sampling dates from 6-21 May 2019. Another 5 cases have sample dates ranging from 2014 to 2018.

Of the 24 cases in 2019, 12 are female and the median age is 64 years, with an age range of 40 to 84 years. The most commonly reported cruise ship destinations are Croatia, Corfu, Greece, Israel, Italy, Jordan, Montenegro and Oman.

A total of 717 _Salmonella_ infections were reported from 29 Apr 2019 to 2 Jun 2019 in England and Wales compared with 367 from 1 to 28 Apr 2019, according to Public Health England figures.

Investigations to date indicate there is more than one cruise holiday associated with the outbreak. Patients for whom information is available said they ate all meals on the cruise ship with many spending the entire incubation period onboard.

The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) reported that information on whether the different cruise ships were run by the same company is not yet available. "However, it is likely that that the same contaminated product would have been distributed to different ships. Considering that the latest reported onset of symptom was on 21 May 2019 and taking into account certain reporting delays, it is likely that additional cases associated with this event will be reported in the UK and in other EU/EEA countries able to timely perform sequencing of _Salmonella_ Enteritidis isolates from patients with a history of travel abroad."

So far, Denmark, Israel and Luxembourg have reported no closely related cases.
