Yellow Fever Epizootic Confirmed in the State of Monagas, Venezuela
----------------------
The Ministry of Health of Venezuela received a report on 27 Feb 2004
(Epidemiological Week/EW 8) on the death of monkeys in the town of Caserio
El Salto, along the Morichal Largo river near the city of Maturin, Monagas
state.
Due to the possibility that the epizootic was caused by the yellow fever
virus, health authorities immediately took the necessary measures for
epizootic and epidemiological surveillance, vaccination against yellow
fever, and social mobilization.
Ecological investigation confirmed deaths among primates. A total of 13
Araguato monkeys (_Alouatta_ sp.) were captured, and samples were taken
from them for laboratory examination. Also captured were mosquitoes and
other wild animals, and sentinel hamsters were utilized. In addition,
samples were taken of febrile and asymptomatic residents of the area, with
a review of local morbidity and mortality resulting from jaundice and
icteric febrile diseases.
At the same time, a campaign of mass vaccination was carried out in the
affected municipality and among the city residents. Over 296 656 doses of
vaccine against yellow fever were administered in the state of Monagas,
reaching coverage levels of over 91 percent. Additionally, the vaccination
was extended to the states of Anzoategui, Delta Amacuro, and Sucre.
On 21 May 2004, the laboratory reported having isolated the yellow fever
virus in a sample from one (1) of the primates. Up to now, no human cases
have been reported.
