Bluetongue outbreak in Pilbara
------------------------------
The National Arbovirus Monitoring Program has changed its bluetongue
virus boundaries, after the detection of infected cattle on a Pilbara
station in Western Australia.

The discovery will mean an extra 20 stations in the region will no
longer be able to sell stock to markets in Israel, Jordan, and Saudi
Arabia. Bluetongue is a sub-tropical virus that's carried by midges.
It mainly affects sheep and goats, but it can also be carried by cattle.

Dr Tony Higgs, from the WA Department of Agriculture and Food, says
the 20 stations were only last year [2009] classified as being free
of bluetongue, but unfortunately are now back on the infected areas list.

[Bluetongue is an insect-borne, viral disease primarily of sheep,
occasionally goats and deer and, very rarely, cattle. The disease is
non-contagious and is only transmitted by insect vectors. Bluetongue
is different from most other diseases covered by AUSVETPLAN
(Australian Veterinary Emergency Plan). The causes of most other
exotic diseases are not present in Australia, whereas a number of
types of the bluetongue virus are present in Australia, but natural
bluetongue disease has not occurred there. The disease is caused by a
virus belonging to the family Reoviridae.

Evidence (antibodies) of bluetongue virus infection is present in
cattle and farmed and feral deer in many areas of Australia but it
has not been reported in the major sheep-growing areas. Humans are
not affected.

The virus is present in most countries of Africa, the Middle East,
India, China, the United States, and Mexico. Bluetongue virus
infection, without associated clinical disease, is present in
Southeast Asia, Papua New Guinea, northern South America, and
northern Australia. A strain of bluetongue virus was first identified
in Australia in 1975 from trapped insects but despite its long-term
presence, it has not caused any clinical disease.

The disease is characterised by fever, widespread haemorrhages of the
oral and nasal tissue, excessive salivation, and nasal discharge. In
acute cases the lips and tongue become swollen and this swelling may
extend below the lower jaw. Lameness, due to swelling of the cuticle
above the hoofs and emaciation, due to reduced feed consumption
because of painful inflamed mouths, may also be symptoms of this
disease. The blue tongue that gives the disease its name occurs only
in small number of cases. Convalescence of surviving sheep is slow.
The high fever in sheep results in wool breaks, which adds to
production losses.

The virus cannot be transmitted between susceptible animals without
the presence of the insect carriers. The incidence and geographical
distribution of bluetongue depends on seasonal conditions, the
presence of insect vectors, and the availability of the susceptible
species of animals. The insect carriers, biting midges, prefer warm,
moist conditions and are in their greatest numbers and most active after rains.

Bluetongue virus does not survive outside the insect vectors or
susceptible hosts. Animal carcasses and products such as meat and
wool are not a method of spread. Survival of the virus within a
location is dependent on whether the vector can overwinter in that area.

The strategy is to contain the outbreak and minimise trade impact by
- using a combination of quarantine and movement controls to prevent spread
- treatments and husbandry procedures to control vectors, reduce
transmission and protect susceptible animals
- tracing and surveillance to determine the extent of virus and
vector distribution
- zoning to define infected and disease-free areas.

There is no justification for stamping out but some animals may need
to be destroyed for welfare reasons. It is not possible to eradicate
the bluetongue vectors. However, the Exotic Animal Disease Response
Agreement only applies to bluetongue disease in its classical virulent form.
