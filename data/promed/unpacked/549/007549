[In reporting the occurrence of various vaccine-preventable diseases, the Minister of Public Health, Andre Mama Fouda, stated the following:]

"That is not all, in Cameroon 1184 cases of yellow fever have been registered since the beginning of the year [2013] of which 111 cases have been confirmed. The ravages caused by diseases avoidable by vaccination also extend globally."

[Byline: Blaise Djouokep]

[This report came late to ProMED's attention. It is curious that over 1000 cases of suspected yellow fever cases with over 100 confirmed, escaped notice of the international and local press, as well as the WHO. Obviously, the occurrence of cases has significance for the health of the local populace as well as travelers to the country. It would be of interest to know specifically where these cases occurred and if a vaccination campaign was implemented.

The WHO has informed the FMOH [Federal Ministry of Health, Nigeria] of a confirmed case of yellow fever in Diffa, Republic of Niger, a community sharing the borders of 2 states (Borno and Yobe) in Nigeria. Alert was sent to the DSNOs [Disease and Surveillance Notification Officers at the border of LGAs [Local Government Areas] (i.e. Abadam and Mobbar in Borno state and Yusufari and Yunusari in Yobe state) and the 2 state's epidemiologists to step up active surveillance for yellow fever and carry out sensitization activities, especially in the border communities to Diffa. Reports received so far from the 4 LGA DSNOs [District Surveillance Nodal Officers] indicated that active yellow fever surveillance and sensitization, including public awareness creation, are ongoing in the LGAs, especially at the border communities to Diffa.

[It is good to hear that WHO has informed Nigeria -- and presumably Chad also close to the Niger border -- about the outbreak. We suppose that WHO/GOARN will shortly announce it publicly.
