[The above notification, submitted to the OIE 11 days after the
laboratory confirmation of the outbreak, leaves room for some queries:

1. Were sheep exposed as well, as seemingly apparent from the data on
Outbreak 1?
2. In case affirmative, have clinical cases been seen/confirmed in
sheep? What was their morbidity/mortality rate?
3. How was the start of the outbreak (reportedly, 24 Jun 2008)
determined? In view of the fact that the anatomo-pathological
examination and the electron microscopy were found positive on 25 Jun
2008, while sheep pox and goat pox have an incubation period of 8 to
13 days in most natural infections, and that the erythematous macules
usually appear 2 to 5 days after the 1st sign of the infection,
namely fever, a much earlier start might have been anticipated. - Mod.AS]
