Following the death of 2 health workers in Liberia as a result of exposure to the deadly Ebola virus, the West African Health Sector Union's Network (WAHSUN) has advised all governments and employers in the region to formulate and implement requisite policies and intensify education on occupational health and safety at all levels in the health sector. WAHSUN gave the advice in a communique it issued at the end of its 1st quadrennial sub-regional conference in Abuja. The communique was signed by Nigeria's general secretary, National Association of Nigeria Nurses and Midwives, Comrade Yusuf Badmus, and the general secretary, Health Services Workers Union of Ghana, Comrade Abu Kuntulo.

The group expressed pessimism that the attainment of universal health coverage in the region might, for a long time, remain a mirage, unless governments in the region redouble their efforts in training and re-training of health workers. According to WAHSUN: "All governments, employers and affiliate unions/associations, must formulate/implement requisite policies and intensify education on occupational health and safety at all levels in the health sector to create awareness and provide protective gears and necessary logistics for care providers, to reduce the incidence of such deadly ailments like Ebola, which has claimed the lives of 2 health workers in Liberia. The conference calls for due recognition of this supreme sacrifice foisted on the workers and their families and compensation paid forthwith. The attainment of universal health coverage in Africa is very distant largely because of the qualitative and quantitative shortage of human resources for health. Conference-in-session thus calls for the training/re-training, employment and retention of more health workers towards meeting universally accepted standards of health professionals/patients ratios."

The body, however, condemns in strong terms what it describes as "the unjust dismissal of trade union leaders by the Liberian government for challenging arbitrary deductions from workers' wages in February 2014. WAHSUN demands the immediate reinstatement of the workers and the full payment of their wages till date. "Conference-in-session observed that the Liberian government has consistently shunned voices of reason and international labour standards that guarantee the rights of all workers to organize, in its recent work bill.

WAHSUN thus calls on the Liberian government to address this legitimate concern."

[These 2 deaths have been reported previously, but the highlighting of this issue is warranted by the situation in West Africa whereby the prompt provision of aid from international health organisations and the efforts of the local medical services combined to limit the extent of this outbreak. The governments of those countries at risk from Ebola virus disease should endeavour to support their medical staff rather than penalise them, if that is what happened. - Mod.CP
