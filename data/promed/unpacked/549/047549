What we know about the symptoms -- and the severity -- of the omicron variant
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When it was discovered, omicron alarmed scientists.

The variant looked wildly different from earlier versions of the coronavirus -- and it quickly became clear that these mutations gave omicron an uncanny ability to sidestep our vaccines and spread very rapidly.

But it has taken longer to untangle what, if anything, sets an omicron illness apart from that of its predecessors. And most of all, does this variant cause less severe disease than the variants that have come before it?

With infections at all-time highs in the U.S., the clinical picture is now coming together and starting to confirm what other countries have found -- a typical case of omicron not only presents slightly differently but also likely carries a lower chance of getting seriously ill.

Scientists at Case Western Reserve University have preliminary evidence that the risk of being admitted to the hospital or the intensive care unit during the omicron surge in the U.S. is about half of the risk observed during the delta surge. And this reflects what doctors across the country are now seeing firsthand with their patients.

"This is a pretty different surge," says Dr. Brendan Carr, chair of emergency medicine for the Mount Sinai Health System -- where the emergency rooms are busier than ever but many of the COVID-19 patients are not sick enough to be admitted.

But as with any variant of SARS-CoV-2, your absolute risk depends on many factors, including whether you're vaccinated and boosted, your age, your overall health and your economic situation.

"In the older age group, it's still a nasty disease, even if it's less (nasty) than the delta variant," says Dr. Pamela Davis, who's a pulmonologist at Case Western Reserve University and a senior author on the new study. "You don't get off scot-free just because you happen to be infected in the time of omicron."

"While omicron does appear to be less severe compared to delta, especially in those vaccinated, it does not mean it should be categorized as 'mild,' " said the World Health Organization's director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, on Thursday [6 Jan 2022]. "Just like previous variants, omicron is hospitalizing people and it is killing people."

Indeed, hospitalizations across the U.S. now stand at more than 126 000, and more than 1 in every 4 ICU beds is filled with a COVID-19 patient, according to the latest data from the Department of Health and Human Services.

When you get sick with omicron, what are the symptoms?
----------------------------------------
What those hospital numbers don't tell us is what a typical case looks like.

As with previous variants, the vast majority of people infected with omicron have a mix of symptoms that resolve relatively quickly and don't require hospital care.

And doctors are finding many of these cases tend to look like an ordinary upper respiratory infection. In other words, what you think of as the common cold.

"It's mostly that runny nose, sore throat and nasal congestion," says Dr. John Vanchiere, the associate director of the Center for Emerging Viral Threats at LSU Health Shreveport. "The cough is milder (than previous variants), if there's any cough at all, and fever seems to be a little less common."

This fits with early data from the U.K. showing that fever and cough are not as prevalent with omicron cases there and that the 5 top symptoms are runny nose, headache, fatigue, sneezing and sore throat. [https://joinzoe.com/learn/omicron-symptoms]

With omicron, the symptoms also come on more quickly once you're infected. Several studies have found that the incubation period -- the time it takes to develop symptoms after being exposed -- is about 3 days. In contrast, delta took about 4 days, and the original variant took more than 5. [Jansen L, Tegomoh B, Lange K, et al. Investigation of a SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.529 (Omicron) Variant Cluster -- Nebraska, November-December 2021. MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep 2021;70:1782-1784. doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm705152e3]

Another difference doctors are noticing: Loss of smell and taste -- considered a telltale sign of COVID-19 -- is not nearly as common with omicron infections. And fewer patients have symptoms related to lower respiratory problems, such as shortness of breath, says Vanchiere, including older patients.

At the same time, it appears -- anecdotally at least -- that certain symptoms show up more with omicron than they did with delta. Three that have gained attention are nausea, night sweats and lower back pain.

But it's very possible that doctors and patients are simply paying more attention to these symptoms than they did with earlier variants, says Dr. Scott Roberts, an assistant professor of infectious diseases at the Yale School of Medicine.

"A lot of this is probably magnifying these symptoms under a microscope instead of clear changes," he says. "Omicron versus delta are really more similar than they are different."

And just like earlier variants, omicron can't be defined as causing only a narrow group of symptoms. As at earlier stages in the pandemic, many patients are still having some combination of fever, gastrointestinal problems, aches and pains, brain fog, weakness and, less often, trouble breathing, says Mount Sinai's Carr.

"Omicron can present in myriad different ways," he says.

It's also still not clear how much vaccines and prior infections are responsible for some of these early clinical impressions that omicron is causing a milder constellation of symptoms, says Dr. Daniel Griffin, who's chief of infectious diseases at ProHEALTH in New York and an instructor at Columbia University. "It just seems that people who have been vaccinated ahead of time are getting much milder symptoms across the board," he says.

This was the case even before omicron: People who had breakthrough infections tended to have fewer symptoms -- and milder ones -- than those who were unvaccinated.

So if I do get omicron, what's my risk of getting very sick?
----------------------------------------
With SARS-CoV-2, the big danger is that a mild illness will turn into a life-threatening one. Although that could definitely still happen with omicron, the risk appears to be lower than it was with delta.

A study published online on [2 Jan 2022] provides some of the first compelling evidence from the U.S. that the chance of ending up in the hospital is lower with omicron compared with the delta variant. [Lindsey Wang, Nathan A. Berger, David C. Kaelber, et al. Comparison of outcomes from COVID infection in pediatric and adult patients before and after the emergence of omicron. MedRxiv 2021.12.30.21268495; doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.12.30.21268495]

Scientists at Case Western Reserve University analyzed health records from more than a half-million people infected with SARS-CoV-2 across the country, including 14 000 people possibly infected with omicron from [15-24 Dec 2021], after the variant became dominant.

"In this period, we still have delta circulating in the community. But you're pushing more and more and more toward the omicron variant," says Davis, who contributed to the study.

Then the researchers looked to see if there was a difference between people infected during the end of the delta wave and those infected during the early stage of the omicron wave. "The difference was huge," says data scientist Rong Xu, who led the study and is also at Case Western Reserve University. "We didn't need to do any complicated statistics to see the difference."

Xu and her colleagues found that the risk of needing to go to the ER dropped from about 15% during the delta surge to 5% during the early omicron surge (about a 70% decrease) and the risk of being hospitalized dropped from 4% to 2% (or by 50%).

If a person did end up in the hospital, the person's risk of being admitted to the ICU or being put on a ventilator also decreased substantially at the end of December [2021] compared with during the delta surge. Specifically, the risk of being admitted to the ICU fell from 0.8% to 0.4% (or by 50%) and the chance of being put on a ventilator fell from 0.4% to 0.1%.

This lower risk with omicron is also consistent with what scientists have observed in South Africa and the United Kingdom.

Xu and her team estimate that, in their study, about 60% of the people were vaccinated. So some of this lower risk could be because of vaccination, but the data altogether suggests that there is a reduced risk for hospitalization with the omicron variant compared with the delta variant.

In particular, Xu and her team observed a similar reduction in risk across all age groups, including children under age 5, who are not eligible for vaccination, and children ages 5-15, who may have been vaccinated but haven't been boosted.

That consistency, Xu says, suggests the reduction in severity is due, in part, to something inherent with omicron itself and not simply because of changes in vaccination status.

"So this is really something that's different between omicron and delta," Xu says. That all said, this reduction in risk doesn't mean omicron will be mild for everyone. For people who are at high risk for severe disease, such as older people or those with underlying health issues, the chance of being hospitalized is still quite significant. For example, if you're over age 65, your risk of being hospitalized with COVID-19 is still 5% with the omicron variant, which means 1 in 20 people infected in this age group will end up in the hospital. (By contrast, with the original version of the virus, the rate was 1 in 10.)

"The risk is not zero," says Xu's colleague Davis, speaking of omicron. "Many people are still going to be admitted to the ICU, and some people are still going to need to have mechanical ventilation."

That's why, she says, everyone should be vaccinated and boosted. As with previous variants, being vaccinated greatly protects you from severe disease with omicron. A study from the U.K. government, published last week, found that 3 doses of vaccine cut the risk of hospitalization due to omicron by about 80% compared with a person who's not vaccinated at all. [https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1044481/Technical-Briefing-31-Dec-2021-Omicron_ severity_ update. pdf]

If you do end up at the hospital, how bad is it?
----------------------------------------
Even though early data shows that omicron is milder than delta, many hospitals are packed because the sheer number of people getting infected is enormous.

And doctors are finding a key difference among their patients who are ending up in the ER or being admitted: Many are neither struggling to breath nor dealing with perilously low oxygen levels.

Those 2 conditions were "a hallmark of the first disease and of delta and not nearly as prominent in omicron," says Mount Sinai's Carr.

In the past, it was basically a given that a severe case of COVID-19 would wreak havoc on the lungs, at times leading to pneumonia and uncontrolled inflammation. But this apparent change in the disease -- that a severe infection in the lungs doesn't seem as common -- means fewer people need supplemental oxygen or intubation.

"They're not short of breath, and really the lungs are OK," says Roberts, of Yale. These observations also line up with lab research that shows omicron does not replicate in lung tissue as well as delta. [https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2021/12/15/1064597592/a-tantalizing-clue-to-why-omicron-is-spreading-so-quickly]

Many of the patients who are being hospitalized often have some underlying health condition, or they're older and more vulnerable to a viral infection. "What we're seeing is something really tips these patients over the edge," says Roberts. For example, an omicron infection may lead to complications of an existing condition such as diabetes or heart failure.

But Roberts says it's still quite rare for people who are vaccinated and boosted to get seriously ill from omicron. About 80% of the patients at Yale New Haven Hospital are unvaccinated. And among those who are vaccinated, almost all have not received a booster shot.

While it's welcome news that omicron is easier on the lungs, ProHEALTH's Griffin says it's not that way for some of his patients. And among unvaccinated people, he says, an omicron infection can feel like the same unforgiving disease to him.

"If we have a patient who's younger, if we have a patient who's vaccinated, if we have a patient who recently recovered from delta, we're tending to see very mild disease with omicron," says Griffin. "But people who are fresh, with no preexisting immunity, it's hard to see that the virus is milder."

[2] Symptoms: warning signs

COVID symptoms: Emergency warning sign signalling to 'seek medical care immediately'
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
With the omicron variant becoming the dominant strain in the UK, we're learning that COVID infection can present itself in various ways. Previously, the main warning was surrounding the 3 traditional symptoms linked to the virus. However, COVID can also cause different symptoms, including an emergency warning sign.

Coronavirus in numbers: The latest statistics as of 4 Jan 2022
----------------------------------------
The latest Government data reports new 157 758 Covid cases for yesterday [3 Jan 2022]. As the number is rising daily and the infection is spreading fast, being able to spot the lesser-known symptoms of the COVID-19 infection might be useful. These include a sign that could be signalling the need for "medical care", according to a health agency.

Before the new omicron variant emerged, the best-known symptoms of COVID were high fever, cough and loss or change to taste and smell.

However, some health bodies and researchers have been reporting other symptoms linked to coronavirus.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), one sign of COVID you might have not heard of before is new confusion.

The health agency explains this is one of the "emergency warning signs" of COVID. If you experience new confusion, CDC suggests you should "seek medical care immediately".

Another source that reported confusion as a possible symptom of coronavirus is the ZOE COVID Symptom Study app.

The app was launched by health science company ZOE in collaboration with scientific analysis by King's College London. Their research is "the world's largest ongoing study" of COVID with over 4 million users.

"Millions" of the app users have reported new confusion or mental disruption as one of the COVID symptoms. This sign, also known as delirium, presents as 2 types, both indicating a change in your normal behaviour.

The ZOE COVID Study explains you can experience either hyperactive or hypoactive delirium.

How to spot new confusion?
--------------------------
Hyperactive delirium describes abrupt changes in the character and acting strangely. This can include agitation, distress or aggression.

Hypoactive delirium can cause a person to become withdrawn and less responsive, or even drowsy. This type can be harder to spot.

The app explains this symptom mainly occurs in older people with coronavirus. Around 20% of adults aged over 65 years have reported this symptom, while 15% of those aged between 16-65 experienced delirium.

Although delirium might be a warning sign of COVID, it could also be signalling a variety of different health conditions so you should seek medical help, the NHS adds.

[3] Children: hospitalization

Citing rise in hospitalized kids, CDC chief urges increased vaccination
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Today [7 Jan 2022] Rochelle Walenksy, MD, MPH, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), gave a media briefing on the COVID-19 pandemic, saying the country has the tools to keep schools open during the omicron wave, but not enough eligible children are vaccinated.

"A safe and effective vaccine is now recommended for all kids 5 and older," said Walensky. "The virus is constantly throwing up curveballs, and as the virus changes, the science changes."

Walensky said only 15% of US kids ages 5-11 were vaccinated, while just over 50% of those 12-17 were fully vaccinated. She said vaccination significantly reduces the risk of hospitalization for adolescents, with unvaccinated 12-17-year-olds 11 times more likely to be hospitalized than vaccinated peers.

Kids are being hospitalized at the highest rates seen in the pandemic so far, but there has not yet been a signal of increased severity in this age group, Walensky said.

The rise in child COVID-19 hospitalizations is just one marker of the nationwide surge in cases being driven largely by the omicron (B.1.1.529) variant. Yesterday [6 Jan 2022], the country reported 786 284 new COVID-19 cases, and 1870 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins COVID-19 tracker. [https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/cumulative-cases]

Though evidence suggests omicron causes less severe illness, COVID-19 hospitalizations in the United States are nearing their pandemic peak, Reuters reports. [https://www.reuters.com/world/us/cdc-chief-says-us-covid-cases-likely-have-not-yet-peaked-2022-01-07/]

Walensky also noted that the CDC yesterday [6 Jan 2022] aligned its return-to-school guidelines for COVID-positive K-12 students and exposures to match the 5-day window the agency adopted for the wider public on [28 Dec 2022].

Despite the push from the CDC to keep schools open, some school districts across the country have moved to virtual learning this week. And in Chicago, leaders of Chicago Public Schools canceled classes for a 3rd straight day as negotiations with the Chicago Teachers Union over remote learning continue, the Associated Press reports.

FDA shortens booster interval for Moderna
----------------------------------------
Following the recommendations made earlier this week to shorten the booster dose interval for Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine recipients, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) today [7 Jan 2022] said Moderna vaccine recipients can get a booster dose of vaccine 5 months, rather than 6, after the completion of their primary series.

"Vaccination is our best defense against COVID-19, including the circulating variants, and shortening the length of time between completion of a primary series and a booster dose may help reduce waning immunity. Today's action also brings consistency in the timing for administration of a booster dose among the available mRNA vaccines," said Peter Marks, MD, PhD, director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research in a press release. [https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-shortens-interval-booster-dose-moderna-covid-19-vaccine-five-months]

Yesterday [6 Jan 2022] the chief executive of Moderna said people are likely to need a 2nd booster shot in the fall, with frontline workers and people 50 and older a priority, the Washington Post reports.

[4] Israel: post-acute COVID-19 symptoms

Citation: Paul Kuodi, Yanay Gorelik, Hiba Zayyad, et al. Association between vaccination status and reported incidence of post-acute COVID-19 symptoms in Israel: a cross-sectional study of patients infected between March 2020 and November 2021. MedRxiv 2022.01.05.22268800; doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.01.05.22268800

Abstract
Background: Long COVID is a post-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection syndrome characterised by not recovering for several weeks or months following the acute episode. The effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines against long-term symptoms of COVID-19 is not well understood. We determined whether vaccination was associated with reporting long-term symptoms post-SARS-CoV-2 infection by comparing, among individuals previously infected with SARS-CoV-2, those who were vaccinated to those who were not, in terms of self-reported long-term symptoms.

Methods: We invited individuals who were PCR tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection at participating hospitals between March 2020-June 2021 to fill an online questionnaire that included baseline demographics, details of their acute episode and information about symptoms they were currently experiencing. Using binomial regression, we compared vaccinated individuals with those unvaccinated in terms of self-reported symptoms post-acute infection.

Results: Of 951 previously infected individuals who filled the survey, 637 (67%) were vaccinated. The most commonly reported symptoms were fatigue (22%), headache (20%), weakness (13%), and persistent muscle pain (10%). After adjusting for follow-up time and baseline symptoms, fully vaccinated (2 or more doses) individuals were less likely than unvaccinated individuals to report any of these symptoms by 64%, 54%, 57%, and 68%, respectively (Risk ratios 0.36, 0.46, 0.43, 0.32, p < 0.04 in the listed sequence).

Conclusions: Vaccination with at least 2 doses of COVID-19 vaccine was associated with a substantial decrease in reporting the most common post-acute COVID-19 symptoms. Our results suggest that, in addition to reducing the risk of acute illness, COVID-19 vaccination may have a protective effect against long COVID.

[This report provides yet another reason to get vaccinated besides prevention of severe disease, but also prevention of long COVID. There has been little if any information coming out on long COVID following omicron. Perhaps this is due to prior vaccination. It should be possible to determine whether this is the case by comparing long COVID incidence in vaccinated vs unvaccinated individuals. - Mod.LK]

[5] Healthcare system
Date: Fri 7 Jan 2022
Source: The Atlantic [abridged, edited]
https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2022/01/omicron-mild-hospital-strain-health-care-workers/621193/


When a healthcare system crumbles, this is what it looks like. Much of what's wrong happens invisibly. At first, there's just a lot of waiting. Emergency rooms get so full that "you'll wait hours and hours, and you may not be able to get surgery when you need it," Megan Ranney, an emergency physician in Rhode Island, told me. When patients are seen, they might not get the tests they need, because technicians or necessary chemicals are in short supply. Then delay becomes absence. The little acts of compassion that make hospital stays tolerable disappear. Next go the acts of necessity that make stays survivable. Nurses might be so swamped that they can't check whether a patient has their pain medications or if a ventilator is working correctly. People who would've been fine will get sicker. Eventually, people who would have lived will die. This is not conjecture; it is happening now, across the United States. "It's not a dramatic Armageddon; it happens inch by inch," Anand Swaminathan, an emergency physician in New Jersey, told me.

In this surge, COVID-19 hospitalizations rose slowly at first, from about 40 000 nationally in early November [2021] to 65 000 on Christmas [2021]. But with the super-transmissible delta variant joined by the even-more-transmissible omicron, the hospitalization count has shot up to 110 000 in the 2 weeks since then. "The volume of people presenting to our emergency rooms is unlike anything I've ever seen before," Kit Delgado, an emergency physician in Pennsylvania, told me. Healthcare workers in 11 different states echoed what he said: Already, this surge is pushing their hospitals to the edge. And this is just the beginning. Hospitalizations always lag behind cases by about 2 weeks, so we're only starting to see the effects of daily case counts that have tripled in the past 14 days (and are almost certainly underestimates). By the end of the month [January 2022], according to the CDC's forecasts, COVID will be sending at least 24 700 and up to 53 700 Americans to the hospital every single day.

This surge is, in many ways, distinct from the ones before. About 62% of Americans are fully vaccinated, and are still mostly protected against the coronavirus's worst effects. When people do become severely ill, healthcare workers have a better sense of what to expect and what to do. Omicron itself seems to be less severe than previous variants, and many of the people now testing positive don't require hospitalization. But such cases threaten to obscure this surge's true cost.

Omicron is so contagious that it is still flooding hospitals with sick people. And America's continued inability to control the coronavirus has deflated its healthcare system, which can no longer offer the same number of patients the same level of care. Healthcare workers have quit their jobs in droves; of those who have stayed, many now can't work, because they have omicron breakthrough infections. "In the last 2 years, I've never known as many colleagues who have COVID as I do now," Amanda Bettencourt, the president-elect of the American Association of Critical-Care Nurses, told me. "The staffing crisis is the worst it has been through the pandemic." This is why any comparisons between past and present hospitalization numbers are misleading: January 2021's numbers would crush January 2022's system because the workforce has been so diminished. Some institutions are now being overwhelmed by a fraction of their earlier patient loads. "I hope no one you know or love gets COVID or needs an emergency room right now, because there's no room," Janelle Thomas, an ICU nurse in Maryland, told me.

Here, then, is the most important difference about this surge: It comes on the back of all the prior ones. COVID's burden is additive. It isn't reflected just in the number of occupied hospital beds, but also in the faltering resolve and thinning ranks of the people who attend those beds. "This just feels like one wave too many," Ranney said. The healthcare system will continue to pay these costs long after COVID hospitalizations fall. Healthcare workers will know, but most other people will be oblivious -- until they need medical care and can't get it.

The Patients
The patients now entering American hospitals are a little different from those who were hospitalized in prior surges. Studies from South Africa and the United Kingdom have confirmed what many had hoped: omicron causes less severe disease than delta, and it is less likely to send its hosts to the hospital. British trends support those conclusions: As the Financial Times' John Burn-Murdoch has reported, the number of hospitalized COVID patients has risen in step with new cases, but the number needing a ventilator has barely moved. And with vaccines blunting the severity of COVID even further, we should expect the average COVID patient in 2022 to be less sick than the average patient in 2021. ...

The Workers
The healthcare workforce, which was short-staffed before the pandemic, has been decimated over the past 2 years. As I reported in November [2021], waves of healthcare workers have quit their jobs (or their entire profession) because of moral distress, exhaustion, poor treatment by their hospitals or patients, or some combination of those. These losses leave the remaining healthcare workers with fewer trusted colleagues who speak in the same shorthand, less expertise to draw from, and more work. "Before, the sickest ICU patient would get 2 nurses, and now there's 4 patients for every nurse," Megan Brunson, an ICU nurse in Texas, told me. "It makes it impossible to do everything you need to do."

Omicron has turned this bad situation into a dire one. Its ability to infect even vaccinated people means that "the numbers of staff who are sick are astronomical compared to previous surges," Joseph Falise, a nurse manager in Miami, told me. ...

The System
In the coming weeks, these problems will show up acutely, as the healthcare system scrambles to accommodate a wave of people sick with COVID. But the ensuing stress and strain will linger long after. The danger of COVID, to individual Americans, has gone far past the risk that any one infection might pose, because the coronavirus has now plunged the entire healthcare system into a state of chronic decay. ...

To be clear, these problems are not affecting just COVID patients, but all patients. When Swaminathan's friends asked what they should be doing about omicron, he advised them about boosters and masks, but also about wearing a seat belt and avoiding ladders. "You don't want to be injured now," he told me. "Any need to go to the emergency department is going to be a problem." ...

Some experts are hopeful that omicron will peak quickly, which would help alleviate the pressure on hospitals. But what then? Ranney fears that once hospitalizations start falling, policy makers and the public will assume that the healthcare system is safe, and do nothing to address the staffing shortages, burnout, exploitative working conditions, and just-in-time supply chains that pushed said system to the brink. And even if the flood of COVID patients slows, healthcare workers will still have to deal with the fallout -- cases of long COVID, or people who sat on severe illnesses and didn't go to hospital during the surge. ...

[For those who wish to see the detailed global data, a snapshot of the Worldometer table at the time we accessed it is available at https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/2022%20WORLDDATA%20JAN6_1641583094.pdf.

A 7-day series of cumulative data reported by countries, territories, and reporting entities can be found at https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/2022%20JAN6WORLD7_1641583112.pdf.

In the past 24 hours, 28 countries including the USA (900 310), France (328 214), Spain (242 440), the UK (178 163), India (141 374), Argentina (110 533), Italy (108 297), Australia (98 686), Turkey (63 214), Brazil (54 900), Germany (59 393), Sweden (41 383), Portugal (38 734), Canada (34 919), the Netherlands (34 872), Greece (29 334), Belgium (27 282), Mexico (28 023), Switzerland (27 997), Columbia (26 190), Ireland (21 926), Philippines (21 747), Denmark (16 779), Viet Nam (16 278), Russia (16 735), Israel (14 745), Poland (11 901), and Bolivia (11 002) reported the highest numbers of cases, all reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases. A global total of 7004 deaths were reported in the preceding 24 hours (late 5 Jan 2022 to late 6 Jan 2022). The exponential rise in cases over the last couple of weeks can be attributed to the rapid increase in the omicron variant cases in over 90 countries. Studies suggest that the omicron variant causes milder disease than the previously dominant delta variant, but the high number of cases caused by this highly infectious/transmissible variant could rapidly overwhelm hospitals and health systems. The 7-day averages indicate an increasing global trend on cases with some reduction in deaths.

A total of 75 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 43 of the 75 countries are from the European region, 8 are from the Americas region, 5 are from the Western Pacific region, 6 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 3 from the South East Asia region, and 10 are from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have increased by 66.4%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 0.49%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 75.9% increase in daily reported cases and a 23.9% increase in reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily reported over 2.9 million newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours with over 303.78 million cumulative reported cases and over 5.49 million reported deaths. - Mod.UBA
