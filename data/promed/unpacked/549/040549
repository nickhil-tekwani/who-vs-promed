ANTHRAX, VACCINE FAILURE? - SPAIN: REQUEST FOR INFO

A recent item in 'Animal Pharm', an industry newsletter, stated that an
anthrax vaccine used in Cantabria apparently "killed" a number of animals
to which it had been administered. Vaccination is carried out annually in
some parts of Cantabria since 1990 when the last animal deaths from anthrax
were reported. However during this Spring's vaccination programme done in
April, the local press reported that 18 animals died.
The region's health authorities informed Animal Pharm that the deaths were
"particularly surprising given that the locally manufactured vaccine
employed a strain of anthrax [sic] that is widely used and normally
innocuous. It is thought that the Sterne anthrax strain contained in the
vaccine had not been properly attenuated and so resulted in the death of
younger and weaker animals." The vaccine was immediately withdrawn.
It would be appreciated in anyone with direct knowledge of this incident
would share it with us.
In that this programme has been in effect for 8 years apparently without
prior incidents must raise a number of questions. Some species, e.g.
llamas, are very susceptible to this vaccine strain so it is not risk-free
if used carelessly. The Sterne vaccine is not an "attenuated strain"; such
a description would not be inaccurate for the old 'Pasteur' vaccine, which
would kill some 3% of vaccinated livestock. Personal experiences by myself
& others have found that some Sterne vaccines are contaminated by a variety
of organisms; for example, we have identified _Bacillus subtilis_,
_Pseudomonas_ sp., and _Staphylococcus epidermidis_, coagulase negative
organisms in such vaccines.
Central Spain has endemic anthrax and reports a significant number of human
cases each year.
