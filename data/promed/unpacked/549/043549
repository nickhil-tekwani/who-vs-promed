Fears are growing that there could be more cases of the rare bovine TB after reports of an outbreak at a large livestock farm in Lincolnshire.

Farmers Weekly has reported that up to 40 cattle were slaughtered after cattle tested positive for the disease in October [2014]. But news of the outbreak came to light only this week.

An NFU spokeswoman said: "Lincolnshire is a TB-free county, and we have always thought the only way TB could come into the county is on a lorry, because we don't have infected badgers. To the best of our knowledge, we don't have many infected cattle, as the Defra website shows. The number of TB cases is in single figures. But being Lincolnshire, yes, the outbreak is of great concern." The incidence of bovine TB cases in low-risk areas such as Lincolnshire is "very low", according to Defra.

It is hard to spot bovine TB as the signs are similar to other diseases and normally only develop in advanced stages of infection.

The disease is normally picked up in the compulsory cattle testing programme before clinical signs develop. Occasionally, it is also detected during inspections of slaughtered cattle.

But you should look out for cattle that:

1. keep getting thinner
2. have a light fever that keeps coming back
3. are weak and have a reduced appetite
4. some infected cattle will also have:
- swollen lymph nodes, for example in the neck
- a moist cough that gets worse in the morning and during cold weather or exercise
- chronic mastitis (an infection of the udder that is not cured by the conventional antibiotic therapy)

Humans can catch bovine TB through:

1. unpasteurised milk or dairy products from an infected cow, buffalo, goat or sheep
2. inhaling bacteria breathed out by infected animals
3. inhaling bacteria released from the carcasses of infected animals or from their excretions (such as faeces)
4. infection is more likely if an unprotected wound is exposed to bacteria from an infected animal.
5. but the risk of infection is very low for the vast majority of the population.

Symptoms are similar in human TB, including weight loss, fever, night sweats and a persistent cough.

If you develop these symptoms, consult a doctor. The disease can be treated by a complex combination of drugs over a long period.

How to reduce the risk of infection:

1. isolate suspect animals and their carcasses
2. do not get too close to the heads of infected animals or hold them
3. avoid unpasteurised milk from suspect animals
4. wash your hands regularly, especially before eating and smoking
5. don't eat, drink or smoke in animal areas.

[One of the routes by which _M. bovis_ could be introduced into a "TB-free county" in the UK is by an infected non-bovine animal or by an infected human. Interestingly, _M. bovis_ was found in a stray cat in Lincolnshire during a 4-year study (2003-2008); see Ref. The origin of the cat was not available.
