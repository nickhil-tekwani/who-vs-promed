Yesterday victim number 18 died from the strange syndrome. Four
medications for control of hypertension are being studied in the United States.
The hypothesis of "medicine toxicity" is strong in the investigations
conducted by the multidisciplinary team that is clarifying the causes of
the severe syndrome that, according to authorities, has claimed 18 victims,
the last of which died yesterday.
The director of the Gorgas Institute, Jorge Motta, informed that samples of
4 medicines used for control of arterial pressure [hypertension], were sent
to the Food and Drug Administration [FDA] of the United States.
These are medicines that were provided by the pharmacies of the Social
Security health system. The Minister of Health, Camilo Alleyne, said that
Lisinopril and Enalapril are 2 of the drugs under
investigation. Nevertheless, there is no evidence that confirms that they
[the medications] are the cause of the syndrome and therefore they have not
been removed from the market.
According to Motta, what "weakens" the hypothesis on the medications is
that not all of the patients (there are 28 reported cases) were taking
medication for arterial pressure [anti-hypertensives].

Families of the deceased denounce changes in medications used to maintain
pressures [to control high blood pressure]
A woman from Veraguas died yesterday in Santo Tomas hospital, becoming
victim number 18.
The funeral room of the Parque del Recuerdo cemetery was filled with
relatives and friends of a 74-year-old woman who died on Tues [3 Oct 2006]
at the Dr. Arnulfo Arias Madrid Social Security Hospital Complex (CSS).
This case was admitted to the Emergency Room of the CSS on 19 Sep [2006],
after 24 hours of not being able to urinate, and died 15 days later.
This case was one of the 18 fatal victims of a "syndrome" that as of
yesterday has affected 28 persons greater than 60 years of age, the
majority of whom were insured by Social Security.
For the relatives of this case, the cause of the illness that ended her
life was a change in medications that she was taking to keep her blood
pressure stable. The grandson said that his grandmother suffered from high
blood pressure and arthritis.
He was sure that 2 weeks before she presented the 1st urinary problems
[difficulty in urination], there had been a change in medications that had
been used to treat her blood pressure from one she had been using for
various years.
This new medication was one of the medications that are 'under the
microscope' by the health authorities, that are now looking at "toxicity"
[as the cause of the as-yet-undiagnosed fatal syndrome].
During one of the press conferences held daily on the epidemiologic alert,
the Minister Camilo Alleyne and his team explained that the laboratory
tests had ruled out the possibility of infectious transmission. In fact,
yesterday morning, Martin Torrijos was at the Social Security Hospital
Complex to visit patients.
In the CSS yesterday there were 3642 slots for appointments and 20 percent
of patients did not attend their scheduled appointments.
The Minister emphasized that there has not been person-to-person
transmission; there has not been a single case reported from any private
hospital and there has not been an increase in febrile illnesses presenting
to the health sector.
He announced the arrival of other specialists in a plane from the Center
for Disease Control [CDC] from Atlanta [Georgia], the United States, who
will collect and analyze new specimens of tissues and fluids from affected
patients.
The majority of the cases and of the deaths by this syndrome were reported
in September [2006], although the authorities had said that they had
knowledge of this disease since much earlier, including June [2006].
The deceased are 90 percent men and 10 percent women. The majority of the
cases came from the periphery of the Capital city.
[Authorities announced] that no medications have been recalled from the
Social Security.
The authorities recommend that physicians be consulted and people should
not self-medicate.
Key telephone numbers: The Ministry of Health has established the following
numbers to get information on this subject: 512-9361/ 512-9358/512-9324
The Ministry of Health of Costa Rica informed Acan-Efe news that it stays
in constant contact with the Panamanian authorities to monitor any
developments in the strange disease that has caused the death of at least
17 people.
"We maintain contact in order to receive current and precise information on
the cause of the deaths, which will provide us a base upon which to make
required recommendations or sanitary measures," explained the Ministry of
Costa Rican Health in an official notice.
The Ministry did not specify what sanitary controls were being considered,
and ruled out a closure of the border.
In keeping with this, the Ministry of Health, Camilo Alleyne, said
yesterday that the Government has communicated with the different
international representatives in the country to explain that the syndrome
is not contagious.

[ProMED would like to thank Naomi Bryant, Information Officer, National
Travel Health Network and Centre, United Kingdom <naomi.bryant@uclh.nhs.uk>
for providing us with the URL for the Ministry of Health of Panama
<http://www.minsa.gob.pa/>, where one finds links to daily press
conferences on the right side of the page (the most recent as of 5 Oct 2006).
From the above newswires, the current suspicions are being directed at
medications used to control high blood pressure. It appears as though the
cases are confined to patients followed by the Social Security system in
Panama. (For information on the Social Security system in Panama, see
<http://www.css.org.pa/Index.aspx>). The majority of patients seem to have
been on medications for hypertension, and perhaps had recently undergone a
change in such medications.
The 2 drugs that are mentioned in the newswire, lisinopril and enalapril,
both belong to a class of drugs known as angiotensin converting enzyme
(ACE) inhibitors.
From the physician's desk reference (PDR)
<http://pdr.net/druginformation/DocumentSearchn.aspx?documentId=52402433&drugname=Prinivil%20Tablets#Anchor_4>:
"ACE is a peptidyl dipeptidase that catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin
I to the vasoconstrictor substance, angiotensin II. Angiotensin II also
stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex. The beneficial
effects of lisinopril in hypertension and heart failure appear to result
primarily from suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.
Inhibition of ACE results in decreased plasma angiotensin II which leads to
decreased vasopressor activity and to decreased aldosterone secretion. The
latter decrease may result in a small increase of serum potassium. Removal
of angiotensin II negative feedback on renin secretion leads to increased
plasma renin activity."
According to the Merck Manual
<http://www.merck.com/mrkshared/mmanual/section16/chapter199/199a.jsp>,
"ACE inhibitors can cause acute renal failure in patients who have severe
bilateral renal artery stenosis [narrowing] or severe stenosis in the
artery to a solitary kidney, presumably because under these conditions GFR
[glomerular filteration rate] is maintained by angiotensin II-mediated
constriction of the efferent arteriole, which is abolished by ACE
inhibition. For the same reason, they can cause acute renal failure in
hypovolemic [having low blood volume] patients and in patients with severe
heart failure."
In the initial descriptions of the clinical syndrome, it began with severe
diarrhea (see prior ProMED-mail postings, and the Ministry of Health Press
release from 5 Oct 2006 at <http://www.minsa.gob.pa/>), nausea, and
vomiting, leading to decreased urinary output and then weakness in all 4
extremities. The possibility is there that the nausea, vomiting, and
diarrhea led to a hypovolemic state, which then led to renal failure as a
result of the ACE inhibitors. However, that would not explain why patients
were seen only in the CSS system and not in other health care provider
systems (public health, private sector) -- unless the reporting system is
somehow better in the CSS system, in which case there may be other cases
outside of the CSS system that have not come to the attention of the
authorities. Additionally, it does not explain why there aren't reports of
a concurrent increase in gastroenteritis in either the general population
or the population that uses the CSS for health care.
Once again, we await more information as results of additional testing are
completed and received. - Mod.MPP]
