STREPTOCOCCAL DISEASE - USA (NEW YORK)
======================================
Date: Sat, 15 Mar 1997 16:46:26 -0500 (EST)
From: ProMED-mail <promed@usa.healthnet.org>
A wire service has reported the death, March 7, of a woman with streptococcal
disease. The woman, who had recently given birth, was found to have had a
strain of _Streptococcus_ similar to that found in two other maternity
patients and two hospital workers who cared for them. The deceased, a 39-y-
o, was the only one of the five to develop necrotizing fasciitis.
The other women, who have recovered, and two of the employees caring for them
in the maternity unit at Strong Memorial Hospital [Rochester] were found to
have what appears to be the same strain. Whether or not the patient acquired
the organism from the [asymptomatic] hospital workers may not be determined.
State health investigators are attempting to determine whether there are
links between 22 cases of invasive Group A strep, five of them fatal, that
have occurred in Rochester and three surrounding counties since January. At
this time the five hospital cases are the only ones that appear to have this
particular strain in common.
One other person was stricken with this strain but is recovering. Last year
two people were shown to have been infected with this organism; one
recovered, the status of the other patient is unclear.
