Namibia: anti-anthrax campaign "a success"
------------------------------------------
The aggressive 3 month vaccination campaign against anthrax in cattle in
the Caprivi Region will conclude tomorrow [9 Dec 2006]. Dr Frank Chitate
from the Directorate of Veterinary Services in Caprivi described the
exercise as a great success, with over 105 000 animals vaccinated against
the contagious disease. Officials initially projected that they would
vaccinate about 160 000 animals in the entire region but, according to
Chitate, it was found that some farmers had already vaccinated their
animals even before the mass exercise started. Since the last case of the
disease was announced some time in October 2006, no new cases have been
recorded in Namibia.
By October 2006, the disease had claimed the lives of 20 zebras, 14
elephants, and 4 buffalos in the Chobe National Park, Botswana's largest
wildlife conservation area that borders Namibia. During a Botswana-Namibia
meeting held on 14 Nov 2006, whose main aim was to review the control of
the disease in the affected areas, officials at Kasane revealed that at
least 210 wild animals had died from anthrax. Although this is a large
number, Chitate says the situation has, in the past few weeks, subsided.
This could also be due to the rains that have resulted in grazing grass
growing long, hence limiting the exposure of the animals to the ground.
Despite Chitate declaring the campaign a success, he also explained that
there could be a few farmers who did not take their animals to be
vaccinated. The farmers are advised to report their cases to the nearest
veterinary office in order to have all the animals vaccinated against anthrax.
When the anthrax outbreak in the Caprivi was confirmed 3 months ago, about
16 veterinary officers and supervisors were dispatched to different parts
of the region to vaccinate cattle against the disease. The exercise
followed an urgent meeting that was held between Namibian and Botswana
officials. While Botswana started vaccinating animals then, Namibia only
started after purchasing 180 000 doses of vaccine at a cost of NAD 108 000
[USD 15 350] from South Africa.
The disease this time did not only affect wild animals. A 28 year old man
was admitted to the Katima Mulilo state hospital for suspected anthrax.
Although rare in humans, the disease can be contracted from eating meat
from an animal that has died of anthrax.

[Dr Chitate and his people in the Veterinary Services Directorate are to be
heartily congratulated on their success, as well as the participating
farmers, no mean achievement. A quick note: anthrax, though infectious, is
essentially non-contagious. Contagious spread is very rare. It is now clear
that hemophagious flies -- for example, horseflies and deer flies -- can be
a major mode of spread and over significant distances. This allows the
infection to be spread from wildlife to livestock, and vice versa, and why
livestock vaccination is so important when there are wildlife outbreaks.
It has long been noted that anthrax epidemics stop in African game parks
with the onset of the rainy season. The reason for this is held to be due
to the rain washing blow-fly vomit off the leaves of bushes near dead
carcasses where blow flies go after feeding. The distance involved is only
a few meters. To digest their bloody meal, blow flies have to vomit it up
and then re-digest it. Obviously not all contaminated fly-vomit gets
re-eaten. Then browsers, such as Kudu (a commonly affected species in
Africa) come by and, in feeding on these leaves, get infected.
In the dry season these bush leaves are dry, crinkly and sharp edged, which
browsers seem to enjoy, presumably because of the scratchiness when passing
down the esophagus. With the rains, there is new grazing and young fresh
leaves. Plus, with the rains, the animals will spread out to graze and
browse and not be so limited on where they can find food. There is also
more cover.
The commonest form of human anthrax is the cutaneous form, usually from
skinning and butchering dead animals. Globally, the ratio of skin to
gastroenteric cases is on the order of 100+:1. Where there is suboptimal
nutrition, as in rural Africa, gastroenteric cases will increase in
incidence and with more deaths, though there is evidence for background
immunity in such areas. - Mod.MHJ]
