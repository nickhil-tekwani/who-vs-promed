Anthrax epizootic, a disease that attacks animals and can be transmitted from animals to humans, has hit Natare district, in the Savanes Region of Togo, according to an official communique from the Prime Minister's Office and the Livestock ministry. The communique, issued on Wednesday [5 Feb 2014] in Lome, the capital, said tests on organs removed from the animals at the Dapaong regional Health Centre, confirmed the presence of the disease.

The Health Ministry, in collaboration with those of Agriculture, Livestock and Fishing, have banned the movement of animals suspected to have contaminated the disease and the displacement of the carcasses of slaughtered animals in areas where epizootic is rampant. Similarly, sick animals must be treated and "susceptible" animals vaccinated, the communique said, adding that in view of the possibility of transmitting it from animals to humans, the populations have been asked to refrain from eating meat from dead animals or those presenting symptoms of the disease. The people have also been asked to maintain the highest degree of hygiene.

PANA [Pan African News Agency] reports that northern Togo, where animal breeding is rampant, is a fertile ground for the disease despite measures by the authorities to raise awareness and vaccinate animals.

[Bovine anthrax is a regular occurrence in the Kara and Savanes regions of northern Togo. In 2010 there were 2 outbreaks in Kara with 70 cases and 6 in Savanes with 14 cases; in 2011 there was only a 6-month report of 2 outbreaks in Savanes and only 2 cases; in 2012 there were 2 outbreaks in Kara with 16 cases, and 1 outbreak/1 case in Savanes; and during January to June 2013, 2 outbreaks in Kara (5 cases), and 2 in Savanes (9 cases). The consistent ministerial use of the word "epizootic" (the animal version of epidemic) suggests that the disease is significantly underreported, which implies a constant difficulty in getting the local herd owners to pay attention and participate in vaccination programmes in spite of the fact of having 9 human deaths in 2010.
