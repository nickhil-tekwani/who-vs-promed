Undiagnosed disease with fever and CNS symptoms
-----------------------------------------------
An investigation has been launched to identify the unknown disease
that claimed 4 lives, including 3 children, at Hatibandha in
Lalmonirhat [Rangpur division].

A team of the Institute of Epidemiology Disease Control and Research
(IEDCR) left Dhaka for Lalmonirhat on Wednesday noon [2 Feb 2011].
The team was formed with 5 physicians, IEDCR director Mahmudur Rahman
told bdnews24.com. "I think t he disease which causes high fever is
followed by brain infection."

On Tuesday [1 Feb 2011], the 4 people, including the children, died
between 12 pm and 8:30 pm. One of them died at Rangpur Medical
College Hospital, while the rest died either at home or on their way
to hospital.

At least 30 people were affected by the disease in the last 2 days.

The major symptom of the disease is the rise of temperature at
certain interval and it finally drops sharply, resulting in the
patient's death.

[The information is very sparse and the few symptoms -- fever and
"brain infection" are rather unspecific. Malaria is unlikely as it
usually does not occur in small outbreaks; meningitis or encephalitis
-- for instance enterovirus, Chandipura virus, Nipah virus, or
Japanese encephalitis -- are possibilities. Haemophilus influenza
meningitis usually is not seen in outbreaks and meningococcal
infection would be expected to be associated with skin symptoms.
ProMED-mail will be happy to post further information. - Mod.EP]

The latest overnight [edition] reports an increase in the death toll
to 17, with a symptomatic diagnosis of encephalitis. Experts on
Thursday [3 Feb 2011], clinically identified the unknown disease as
"encephalitis", which claimed 5 more lives in Lalmonirhat and Rangpur
[Rangpur division] Wednesday night and Thursday [2 and 3 Feb 2011].
The final diagnosis will come after examining the specimens at the
Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) laboratory on Fri 4 Feb 2011,
they said. The death toll from the disease now stands at 17.

The dead were identified as [individuals whose ages and locations
are], 10 and 40, of South Goddimari village; 23 of West Bejpur; 50 of
Tongbhanga; and another 8, of local bus terminal area in Hatibandha
upazila [sub-district] of Lalmonirhat.

[If this outbreak turns out to be caused by Japanese encephalitis
virus, it will be the 1st report from Bangladesh posted by
ProMED-mail. However, there have been several ProMED posts for Nipah
virus infection, which occurs periodically in Bangladesh. In the same
edition of The Daily Star, another article reported that 8 people,
mostly children, of Hatibandha and Pirgachha upazilas sub-districts]
of Lalmonirhat and Rangpur districts died of an "unknown disease"
yesterday (2 Feb 2011), raising the death toll to 12 while 24 more
patients are admitted to different hospitals. They will collect blood
samples of the patients and examine the specimens at the Institute of
Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research laboratory, according to
Mahmudur Rahman, director of the institute. Based on the symptoms, he
suspects the disease might be Japanese encephalitis or Nipah virus
infections. He indicated that viral encephalitis is not a new disease
in the country. Every year during the winter, a number of people get
infected with the mosquito borne disease. It is not clear if these 8
cases are part of the 17 mentioned above or not.

Nipah virus is transmitted by _Pteropus_ spp. giant fruit bats. An
