Hundreds of birds die in Kapilvastu
-----------------------------------
Hundreds of wild birds including crows and doves have died at a village of
Kapilvastu district in western Nepal over the past few days. Locals fear it
could be a bird flu epidemic.
"Birds were found dead at jungle and farmed areas over the past 3 days,"
said Nityananda Poudel, a local resident. "Jackals and dogs are feeding on
them, which is making us more anxious."
The District Vet Office said it was investigating the cause behind the
deaths of wild birds at Dabara village of Buddhi VDC in Kapilvastu
district. It was not in a position to confirm or rule out the possibility
of avian influenza. Hundreds of wild and domesticated birds had died in the
far-western district of Kailali and in the eastern district of Saptari a
few days back. The concerned authorities have not, however, confirmed a
single case of bird flu in Nepal.
