[The 2 suspected cases, reported in posting 20151202.3835863, have been promptly denied.

It was encouraging to witness the exemplary Danish response to this (eventually, false) alarm, applying immediately the prescribed measures which could be accomplished within a day from the initial alert.

Denmark maintains its freedom of classical swine fever (CSF) since 1933. This established favourable situation is continuously monitored, based upon the applied general and targeted surveillance in domestic pigs as well as in wild boars. - Mod.AS
