Rise in incidence of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in Saratov Region
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
An increase in the incidence of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) has been recorded in the Saratov Region. 140 cases of HFRS were recorded in the 1st 11 months of 2012, which is a 4.4 fold increase over the figure recorded during the same period in 2011. The increased incidence was recorded in 26 administrative districts of the region. The Incidence rates in the Atkarsky, Lysogorsku, Kalinin, Bazarno-Karabulaksky, and Petrovsky districts are above the average for the oblast.

Overall there was a decreased incidence of infectious and parasitic diseases. The greatest decrease in morbidity concerned acute respiratory illnesses and leptospirosis. On the other hand, marked increases in the incidence were observed for some other diseases, such as HIV infection, chronic viral hepatitis, hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome, acute viral hepatitis A, and acute intestinal infections.

[During the last 2 years the situation in this region was assessed as relatively successful, as there were no more than 40 cases of HFRS annually. Deterioration of the HFRS situation has been observed also in other territories which are HFRS endemic areas, in particular, the Republic of Udmurtia and the Samara region. Experts associate the rise in the incidence of HFRS since the beginning of the year with an increase of rodent population, the vector of HFRS. - Mod.NP

Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) combines a group of clinically similar illnesses caused by hantaviruses of the family _Bunyaviridae_. HFRS occurs throughout the world. Puumala virus is the specific virus likely to be the cause of HFRS in Saratov Oblast. Contamination of dust, food, and hands with the dried urine and excreta of infected rodents, stirred up during cleaning of rodent-infested premises, is the main route of infection.

The Saratov Oblast is a federal subject of Russia (an oblast), located in the Volga Federal District. Its administrative center is the city of Saratov. Population:
