Four people are part of a foodborne botulism outbreak in Spain after eating DIA brand tuna. A batch of canned tuna in sunflower oil of the brand DIA has been removed from sale. The Spanish Agency for Food Safety and Nutrition (AESAN) said those who became ill ate a homemade salad that included the tuna. Spanish media reported one of the patients was still in hospital.

The foodborne outbreak was suspected to be caused by the tuna or grated carrots from Spain with distribution including Andorra, according to a Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF) notice.

AESAN became aware on 9 Aug 2019, through the Spanish rapid information exchange system (SCIRI), of a notification from health authorities in Castilla y Leon of a food poisoning outbreak caused by botulinum toxin linked to consumption of canned tuna in a homemade "Russian" salad. Products have been analyzed, and the presence of botulinum toxin was confirmed in late August 2019 in the consumed can of tuna.

Distribuidora Internacional de Alimentacion (DIA) is a Spanish multinational company specializing in distribution of food, household, and personal care products. The company has more than 6000 stores in Spain, Portugal, Brazil, and Argentina. Tuna was distributed through DIA platforms to the communities of Asturias, Castilla y Leon, Cataluna, Aragon, La Rioja, Murcia, Navarra, Castilla - La Mancha, and Valencia.

Canned tuna in sunflower oil 900-gram with lot code 19/154 023 02587 and expiration date of December 2022 made by Frinsa del Noroeste S.A. is affected. This batch of tuna manufactured by Frinsa was removed from all stores on 10 Aug 2019 by DIA, according to a company statement. The firm asked any customers who had the item to return it to their nearest store.

Botulism is a rare but life-threatening condition caused by toxins produced by _Clostridium botulinum_ bacteria. In foodborne botulism, symptoms generally begin 18-36 hours after eating contaminated food. However, they can start as soon as 6 hours after or up to 10 days later. Botulism can cause symptoms including general weakness, dizziness, double vision, and trouble with speaking or swallowing. Difficulty in breathing, weakness of other muscles, abdominal distension, and constipation may also occur. People experiencing these problems should seek immediate medical attention. Symptoms result from muscle paralysis caused by the toxin.

[Seafood-associated botulism is usually type E. Canned tuna is an uncommon source but has been reported (Johnston RW, Feldman J, Sullivan R: Botulism from canned tuna fish. Public Health Rep. 1963; 78: 561-4).

The following was extracted from ProMED-mail Botulism, smoked fish - Finland ex Canada 20060721.2000:
"_Clostridium botulinum_ type E is naturally highly prevalent in aquatic environments and fish, leading to a high risk of contamination. The hot-smoking processes are usually too low to eliminate botulinum spores. Growth and toxin production from spores in vacuum-packed smoked fish products with anaerobic atmosphere and limited preservative factors is likely during extended storage at temperatures above 3 deg C (37.4 deg F). Therefore, the most important factors controlling _C. botulinum_ growth and toxin production are efficient heat treatments, restricted shelf life, and continuous storage below 3 deg C (37.4 deg F)." - Mod.LL
