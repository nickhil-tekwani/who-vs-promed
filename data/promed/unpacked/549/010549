The [Pakistan] federal government intends to regulate the working of
26 000 poultry farms, mostly small, in a bid to stamp out the Avian
influenza virus which now visits the country frequently. But how far
it can provide safe environ to this vital sector which meets the
growing chicken meat demand, now roughly at 480 000 tons a year, is
anybody's guess.

Although the details of the new strategy are yet to be made public,
the animal husbandry commissioner has made it clear that the 'open
policy' of allowing an entrepreneur to set up a poultry farm after
obtaining just an NOC [no objection certificate] from the relevant
authorities will be replaced with a formal registration system. Since
the reorganization of the fast expanding poultry sector is of the
essence to its future, it is appropriate to have a look at some
recent developments and experiences of other countries in this respect.

First, there is nothing new about bird flu. It has always lived
peacefully with wild birds and chickens for centuries. What is new is
its highly pathogenic strain called H5N1, which has badly mauled the
poultry sector in Asia. The bird flu is so common that most of wild
fowls often remain infected with some mild form of it and that it has
no effect on people.

Second, world consumption of meat has grown dramatically during the
last 40 years, more so in the Third World where the western way of
life, with its heavy consumption of beef burgers and chicken nuggets,
has been strongly promoted by mass media. Then, consumption of
poultry has risen much higher than that of other meats. Its world
output increased from 8.9 to 70.33 million tonnes in 40 years. And
still there is a big pressure on commercial farms to produce more poultry.

Third, just as the world is undergoing climate change, it is also
undergoing a major transformation in diseases. And, here too, human
actions are at the heart of the problem. In fact, the very forces
driving climate change are also at the root of global disease change.
According to the FAO (UN Food and Agriculture Organisation),
"upsurges in animal disease emergencies worldwide are linked to the
increased mobility of people, goods, and livestock" (globalisation),
"changes in farming systems " (more factory farming), "and the
weakening of many livestock health services" (neo-liberal
privatisation and deregulation). The problems are thus systemic.

So, it is the industrialisation of today's poultry sector, which is
creating conditions for bird flu to emerge again and again and spread
rapidly. The example of Bangladesh is quite illustrative. The country
is seen as a success story of the "livestock revolution," having
converted about half of its national poultry production from
backyards to intensive and semi-intensive industrial farms. The
micro-credit NGO [non-governmental organisation], the Bangladesh
Rural Advancement Committee (BRAC) was instrumental in this
transition by financing groups of poor women to set up thousands of
mini-factory farms.

In the process the BRAC became a major, vertically integrated poultry
corporation, with its own large-scale hatcheries, poultry farms, and
feed mills that supply the smaller units. The corporate NGO also
played a central role in the national bird flu preparedness
activities backed by the World Bank. In 2005, the government
contracted it to monitor "hotspots" in the country where migratory
birds flock, and to convert the country's open-house hatcheries into
bio-secure closed facilities. But these actions failed to stop the
bird flu outbreak of March 2007, which happened at a completely
closed poultry farm -- one of the country's largest broiler
operations and hatcheries. From there, it spread quickly through the
smaller model farms and some other large-scale operations.

But what happened in Laos is a different story. The major reason why
the country has not suffered widespread bird flu outbreaks like its
neighbours (Hong Kong, Thailand, Viet Nam, and China are the most
affected) is that there is almost no contact between its small-scale
poultry farms, which produce nearly all of the domestic poultry
supply, and its commercial operations, which are integrated with
foreign poultry companies.

Laos effectively stamped out the disease by closing the border to
poultry from Thailand and culling chickens at the commercial
operations. The government is less concerned about the disease
spreading out from the affected farms because, unlike in Thailand and
Viet Nam, small-scale farmers in Laos are not supplied by big
companies with day-old chicks or feed and, outside of its capital,
poultry is produced and consumed locally. Poultry production is also
more spread out in Laos. It is less dense, less integrated and less
homogeneous -- all of which keeps bird flu from spreading and
evolving into more pathogenic forms.

The Laos experience suggests that the key to protecting backyard
poultry and people from bird flu is to protect them from industrial
poultry and poultry products. It rejects corporate approach to
poultry development, which encourages farmers to sell their poultry
and its products to more distant markets and to use off-farm inputs,
such as feed and day-old chicks supplied by large companies.
Traditional farmer knowledge and biodiversity combined with simple
biosecurity measures appropriate to small farms may be all that is
required to manage the disease effectively in most rural communities.

Hence, as Pakistan moves to re-organise its poultry sector to keep
the bird flu away, the Laos' experience needs to be kept in view.
