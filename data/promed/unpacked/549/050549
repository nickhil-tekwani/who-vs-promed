Elephant found dead in forest, no injury spotted
------------------------------------------------
A sub-adult tusker was found dead under mysterious circumstances in Mayurbhanj district [Odisha state] on Wednesday evening [11 May 2016]. The carcass of the male elephant, aged about 8, was spotted in Tungudu reserve forest near Judia village under Bisoi range. Rairangpur DFO S K Swain said the elephant was seen roaming in Judia village close to Tungudu reserve forest for the last couple of days. No injury mark was spotted and the tusks were intact.

The officials have collected blood samples and sent it to Animals Disease Research Institute (ADRI) in Cuttack. "Cause of the death can be ascertained once we receive the test report," he said.

While this year's [2016] 1st death of elephant due to anthrax was confirmed in Karanjia [Mayurbhanj district, Odisha state], recently another elephant carcass with no injury mark was found near Ambapani canal under Dukura range [Mayurbhanj district, Odisha state]. Forest officials are worried as 4 elephants, particularly in Dukura range, have died of anthrax in the last couple of years which indicates that vaccination of animals done by the veterinary officials has not been foolproof.

Animals can contract anthrax bacteria as the spores manage to survive in the soil even after burial of an infected carcass. The _Bacillus anthracis_ does not get destroyed easily which is why a stringent protocol for disinfection must be adopted, said wildlife lover Vanoo Mitra Acharya.

Although anthrax infection in other wildlife sanctuary has been reported in different parts of the country, its reoccurrence among elephants in the district where Similipal Tiger Reserve (STR) is located is a matter of concern.

Deputy Director of STR Ajit Kumar Satpathy admitted that so far 5 elephants have died of anthrax in the district. "But we can't confirm these cases as we are yet to get the test reports. Veterinary officials have been asked to carry out vaccination drive in forest-side villages to control the disease," he added.

[This is part of what is clearly an ongoing problem in these elephants. I would not be surprised if this was an overflow from nearby livestock anthrax outbreaks. In the meantime, until the cattle cases can be stopped, elephants will be protected by vaccination, which has a long, successful history. The location of the nearby livestock vaccination has this case in the Similipal National Park, from which we had a report on 4 Aug 2015; see 20150804.3556122. The latter 2 reports -- 20151202.3834917 and 20151207.3845799 -- were also in the greater wildlife park complex. So we can presume that the elephant epidemic is progressing possibly unaffected by any direct wildlife disease control actions.

A virtually identical report, obviously from the same official news release, reported, "A carcass of a tusker was sighted near Ambapani nullah under Dukura range inside Similipal sanctuary today" (see http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/carcass-of-elephant-sighted-anthrax-suspected/1/546041.html), confirming the elephant inside the Similipal sanctuary.

Similipal National Park is a national park and a tiger reserve situated in the Mayurbhanj district in the Indian state of Odisha. It is part of the Similipal-Kuldiha-Hadgarh Elephant Reserve popularly known as Mayurbhanj Elephant Reserve, which includes 3 protected areas, that is, Similipal Tiger Reserve (2750 sq km/1062 sq mi), Hadgarh Wildlife sanctuary (191.06 sq km/73.75 sq mi), and Kuldiha wildlife sanctuary (272.75 sq km/105.3 sq mi) (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simlipal_National_Park).
