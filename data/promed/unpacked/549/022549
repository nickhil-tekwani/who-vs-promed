_Salmonella_ in chicken has been linked to over 70 cases in the Czech Republic. Health authorities in the city of Zlin reported the outbreak in the middle of March 2019 at Tomase Bati Regional Hospital. A total of 68 people, of whom 38 were patients and 30 staff, were found to be connected with the salmonellosis outbreak. In addition, 4 people -- 1 staff member and 3 other patients -- were hospitalized in the town of Uherske Hradiste.

A common vehicle of infection was a chicken and rice dish served for lunch on 14 Mar 2019. An epidemiological survey found that all patients consumed this lunch. The alarm was raised on 15 Mar 2019 by the hospital in a message to health authorities. The next day, _Salmonella_ Enteritidis was detected in fecal samples. Samples of raw materials and swabs from the kitchen and storage areas were taken. Sanitation and disinfection of all kitchen and storage areas were ordered. The chicken used in the meals was also destroyed.

Symptoms of _Salmonella_ infection usually appear 12 to 72 hours after infection and include fever, abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea and sometimes vomiting. The illness usually lasts 4 to 7 days, and most people recover without treatment. The laboratory analysis at the Institute of Public Health in Ostrava and in the State Veterinary Institute in Olomouc did not confirm _Salmonella_ in any sample of frozen chicken available during the investigation. Clinical material from patients was sent to the lab of the Veterinary Research Institute in Brno.

In an updated statement concluding the investigation, health authorities in Zlin reported that _ S._ Enteritidis, identical to the strain grown from clinical cases, was confirmed in a chicken and rice sample.

In a statement, officials from the hospital said they had introduced strict measures for food after the _Salmonella_ infection, including strengthening controls on the defrosting and cooking of meat so procedures are monitored consistently. Officials said while the hospital cannot influence the incidence of _Salmonella_ in raw materials supplied to the hospital, they want to focus consistently on the correct procedures for processing. The hospital is also considering buying cameras and putting them in areas where hospital food is being prepared so human error can be detected in time and eliminated in the future.

[Hospital food remains a particular problematic source for foodborne pathogens given the cohort of individuals who may consume it and their comorbidities. Minimizing salmonellosis spread from fowl requires adequate cooking and appropriate kitchen hygiene. - Mod.LL
