The Greek National Veterinary Service has been kind enough to give full
details of the outbreaks of FMD type Asia 1 on its web-site:
<http://www.minagric.gr/greek/2.3.1.9h.html>

On this site there are links to:
- the updated overall report
- 1st and 2nd follow-up reports
- a report on the latest outbreak in Xanthi
- a map locating all the outbreaks
- and the EC decision as of the 19 Jul 2000.

The following is a brief summary of the latest information: Evros
Prefecture - Turkish Border Area
In total there were 8 outbreaks of FMD type Asia 1 close to the Turkish
border in 3 clusters: Evros Delta (1 primary and 3 secondary), Ferres (3
secondary) and Peplos (1 primary).
In these clusters bordering Turkey, the first suspicion was reported and
confirmed on the 11-07-00 in the Evros Delta and the last reported
suspicion was on the 01-08-00 and was confirmed on the 03-08-00 in Ferres.
Eight outbreaks were reported in Bovine herds and one outbreak was reported
in a sheep flock. One outbreak in cattle was detected solely on the basis
of serology.
In total, 48 bovines and 15 sheep presented with clinical signs of FMD out
of 987 susceptible cattle and 642 susceptible sheep. The secondary
outbreaks were detected by forwards tracing and by active clinical
surveillance as part of the Evros Programme.
The origin of the primary outbreaks is considered to be Turkey.
The disease control policy consists of large scale slaughter and
destruction of the carcasses of affected and in-contact animals and also
preventative slaughter based on epidemiological considerations.
In total, 2290 adult bovines,
1344 calves,
1762 sheep,
1867 goats and
97 pigs were slaughtered to date.
Xanthi
Due to Bluetongue all movements of live susceptible animals has been banned
from the Prefecture of Xanthi since 1999.
The first appearance of clinical signs (lameness) was noted by a farmer on
the outskirts of Potamia in south eastern Xanthi on the 31-07-00 who
proceed to treat the affected cows himself. After no improvement was
noticed, the farmer requested treatment advice from a local veterinarian
over the telephone on 03-08-00, the tentative diagnosis was ketosis at this
time.
The farmer finally requested veterinary assistance on 07-08-00 when he
noticed buccal lesions. The local veterinarian suspected FMD and notified
the local veterinary authorities. FMD was confirmed on 08-08-00 by serology.
By 09-08-00 >60% of the herd showed clinical signs of FMD and the entire
herd of 57 milking cows and 67 calves and heifers (2 weeks to 8 months old)
were slaughtered and destroyed.
The origin of this outbreak has been traced to previous active outbreaks in
Ferres, Evros. The transmission is thought to have occurred through the
movement of a specific person who was storing some wood panels on the
affected farm.
The number of susceptible animals in the vicinity is low and there were
little contacts revealed by forwards tracing. However all the local
contacts are under close observation.
