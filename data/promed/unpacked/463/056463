Authorities will cull 275 000 birds from B.C. farms
-------------------------------------------------
All the chickens and turkeys on farms in a hot zone infected with avian flu
-- some 275 000 birds -- will be killed in an effort to stop the spread of
the disease, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) said Wednesday.
The move comes after 2 more farms in the Fraser Valley, just east of
Vancouver, were discovered to be infected with the virus, bringing the
number of infected farms to 5.
Cornelius Kiley, regional veterinary officer for the agency, said tests
have shown the strain of virus found on the first 3 farms was the more rare
and more aggressive form of the H7 avian flu virus.
"This is a new experience for us, and we must deal with it aggressively,"
Kiley said at a news conference.
Once the cull is finished and including the birds that have already died
from the disease, 365 000 birds will be dead.
Chicken farmers in British Columbia's Fraser Valley agree that all the
birds in the area around 5 farms infected with avian flu will have to die
to stop the spread of the disease.
Vic Regier of the B.C. Hatching Egg Commission said farmers accept the move
as a necessary step.
"We want to get control of the virus so that it doesn't move outside that
zone," he said. "We believe that if we depopulate that zone, it'll maintain
it. We talk about the other parts of the province and the valley and we're
hoping to keep it out of there."
Regier said the number of birds to be culled only represents less than 5
percent of the total chicken population in British Columbia.
"We're not talking about a lot of birds here," he said.
Instead, the industry wants to do whatever it takes to eradicate the
disease, which has prompted several Asian countries to close their borders
to Canadian chicken.
All owners of birds depopulated will be compensated.
10 farms and 33 smaller flocks will be involved in the cull.
The virus does not transfer into the food chain.
Authorities imposed a control zone on parts of southern British Columbia
earlier this month. Regulations restrict the movement of any bird in
captivity, including pets, day-old chicks, and hatching eggs.
Farmers must obtain permits to move the birds and any bird product --
including eggs -- out of the area that stretches to the North Shore
mountains, west to the ocean, south to the U.S. border, and east to the
town of Hope.
Among the operations to be culled is one important turkey breeder and a
chicken farm that supplies a majority of eggs supplied to B.C. chicken
producers.
But Regier said he didn't think consumers will notice a drop in
supply. "It'll mean that if we're short of local supply, for example
chicks for the table industry, then we'll have to get them from outside the
province," he said.
"We believe that can be done. We don't believe there will be a shortage.
We'll get co-operation from other parts of Canada and North America. "I
don't think we have to worry about it."
Kiley said consumers should be comfortable that the industry is doing
everything it can to deal with the crisis.
"The industry understands biosecurity. Obviously, they are going to
understand it even more from this day forward out of this entire
experience," he said.
"Every farmer that protects his or her farm by having their own biosecurity
measures in place is protecting the entire industry."
