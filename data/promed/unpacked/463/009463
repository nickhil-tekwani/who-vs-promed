Thailand: 2 Children Are Suspected Avian Influenza Cases
-----------------------------------------------
Thai health authorities have announced 2 suspected cases of
avian-influenza infection in a pair of sisters hospitalized earlier
this week, local media has reported. The sisters, from the northern
province of Phichit, were hospitalized after displaying symptoms
similar to those seen in bird flu sufferers, local health authorities
told the Thai media.
Local test results from the 2 sisters, who are 3 and 4 years old, are
expected to be returned by Thu 27 Jul 2006, before which time no firm
diagnosis can be made. Once the local test results have been
returned, however, they must be confirmed by an official World Health
Organization laboratory before an official statement regarding new
human cases can be made.
The girls were initially sent to Ta Pan Hin District Hospital after
developing flu-like symptoms, including respiratory difficulties
above those associated with seasonal influenza, shortly after a
number of local birds died of unknown causes. They were then moved to
Phichit Provincial Hospital for additional care, where they have been
placed under quarantine and their symptoms monitored for signs of
deterioration.
Also in Thailand, health authorities across the country are preparing
themselves for a possible resurgence in avian influenza infections as
a result of the imminent monsoon season.
The health authorities have placed 3 provinces -- western Suphan Buri
and Kanchanaburi, and Nakhon Pathom, near Bangkok -- on special
alert, as all have suffered outbreaks within the past 2 years. The
northern provinces of Uttaradit, Sukhothai, Phitsanulok and Phichit
have also been designated as worthy of special monitoring.
It has been more than 6 months since Thailand saw a human death from
avian influenza, and prior to the current suspected infections in
Phichit, it was believed the Southeast Asian country's bird-flu
surveillance program was one of the most effective in the region.

Thailand: 3 Suspected Bird-flu Cases in Phichit
-----------------------------------------------
3 more people with suspected bird-flu have been reported in Phichit,
one of the provinces listed by the government as an avian-flu "red
zone." Two of the patients were men aged 59 and 86, and the other was
a boy aged 7. All 3 had reportedly been in contact with dead chickens
and were being treated in an isolation ward at Phichit Hospital.
Pending the results of laboratory tests for evidence of the bird-flu
virus, doctors said the 3 patients were not allowed visitors.
Livestock officers in the province were stepping up disinfection of
sites where irregular poultry deaths were reported. Hundreds of such
deaths have recently been reported in the province.
Meanwhile, deputy chief health officer for Chiang Mai, Surasing
Wisarutarat, warned the public not to cook dead chickens, no matter
how they died. "The group we're most concerned about is immigrant
workers," he said. "They are most likely to opt for dead chickens and
risk contracting bird flu."
Despite numerous reports of irregular poultry deaths in many areas,
particularly the North and Central provinces, the Department of
Livestock Development insists that no avian flu has been detected so
far [see the ProMED-mail archived posts below].

[Taken together, these 2 reports identify 5 suspected human cases of
avian influenza virus infection: Two children (sisters aged 3 and 4
years), 2 adult males (aged 59 and 86 years) and a 7-year-old boy.
Thailand has been free of human cases of avian influenza virus for
more than 6 months. It will be extremely disappointing if the results
of these local tests are confirmed, since the Thai Animal Health
authorities have had considerable success in containing outbreaks of
H5N1 avian influenza in domestic poultry throughout the country.
It is not entirely clear, however, whether the 5 suspected human
cases have been diagnosed on the basis of local laboratory testing or
merely on symptomatology. More information is awaited with some unease.
