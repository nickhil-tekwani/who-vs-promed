A total of 5 Kentucky children were being treated at Kosair Children's Hospital on Friday, 12 Sep 2014, for a potentially life-threatening syndrome usually caused by _E. coli_ infection, and the state health department has launched an investigation into how they got sick. "There is a cluster of children with "hemolytic uremic syndrome," said Beth Fisher, a spokeswoman for the Kentucky Department for Public Health. "We don't know the source at this point." 3 of the sick children are from Hardin County, 1 is from Oldham County and 1 is from Boone County. Fisher did not know their ages, but said they are very young. All remained hospitalized.

Most cases of hemolytic uremic syndrome develop in children after diarrhea associated with infection with certain strains of _E. coli_ especially O157:H7.

"Hemolytic uremic syndrome is a form of kidney injury," said Dr. Kris Bryant, pediatric infectious disease specialist with University of Louisville Physicians and hospital epidemiologist at Kosair Children's Hospital. "Sometimes, patients need dialysis. Some of these patients have required dialysis."

Dr. Kraig Humbaugh, state epidemiologist, said the strains of _E. coli_ associated with the syndrome can be found in contaminated food or water, including water bodies such as lakes. People can get sick by drinking raw, unpasteurized milk or eating uncooked or undercooked meat, Bryant said [or contaminated produce that is eaten uncooked - Mod.LL].

Even though the children in this outbreak are from 3 different counties, officials said, they could have eaten at the same event or restaurant or eaten food that was distributed across counties. "Once we can find the source, we can determine whether there's a continuing public health threat," said Fisher, adding that officials are working with county health departments.

"Most children will recover," Bryant said. But some have long-term kidney damage. "Death is quite rare. But some of them will continue to need dialysis and some of them could require a blood transfusion."

Humbaugh said not all children exposed to these strains of _E. coli_ develop hemolytic uremic syndrome, but up to 10 percent do, and it's more common among young children.

To avoid getting sick, health officials advised people to wash their hands before and after cooking, eating, and visiting a petting zoo; avoid drinking lake or pool water; and avoid unpasteurized milk and apple juice. They also advised cooking meat well and making sure not to put it back onto a plate that previously held uncooked food. "Those are the types of steps people should take," Humbaugh said. "This will reduce their risk."

[Although it is not stated that an enterohemorrhagic pathotype of _E. coli_ was isolated from the diarrheal stools of the affected children, most cases of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) are caused by one of these strains, either O157:H7 or otherwise, especially in a cluster of cases occur in time. Certainly, non-HUS cases caused by the EHEC should also be occurring, with bloody diarrhea as the main reason to seek medical care.

The following was extracted from Lutwick LI. Enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ infections. In: Confronting emerging zoonoses: the One Health paradigm. Yamada A, Kahn LH, Kaplan B, Monath TP, Woodall J, Conti LA (editors). Tokyo, Japan: Springer, (in press).

Risk factors for the subsequent development of HUS after EHEC include children less than 10 years of age, elevated white blood cell counts, persistent low platelet counts without reversal and the use of either antimicrobial agents or antimotility agents during the diarrhea stage before or after bloody diarrhea develops. Since fever is generally not part of the presentation but significant abdominal pain is, patients with diarrhea, significant abdominal pain and no fever should be considered to have EHEC infection, and antimicrobial or antimotility agents should be avoided. Additionally, certain strains -- for example, the so-called clade 8 and the chimeric organism _E. coli_ O104:H4 -- can be associated with a higher risk of HUS.

HUS itself is a thrombotic illness primarily caused by the effects of the EHEC produced Shiga toxin acting on the vascular endometrium of organs where the toxin's receptors are expressed, particularly the kidney and brain. The syndrome consists of the combination of prominent low platelet counts (thrombocytopenia), intravascular red blood cell destruction (hemolysis) and diminished kidney function that can require hemodialysis. Neurological involvement occurs mostly in those who develop renal failure and the central nervous system involvement portends much higher mortality. Indeed, most of the acute mortality relates to neurological disease. Most patients will recover, but some, perhaps 10 percent, remain with renal failure and require chronic hemodialysis. - Mod.LL
