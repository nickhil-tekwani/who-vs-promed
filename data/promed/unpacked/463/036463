An investigation into a _Listeria_ outbreak in Australia linked to 7 deaths has found that the weather played a significant role in contamination.

The outbreak from rockmelons, known as cantaloupe in North America, affected 22 people with 6 cases in New South Wales (NSW), 8 cases in Victoria, 7 in Queensland and one in Tasmania between 16 Jan and 10 Apr this year [2018]. Seven people died, and one case resulted in a miscarriage.

Government officials said the outbreak was linked to one grower named as Rombola Family Farms (RFF), based in Nericon in the state.

The strain of _Listeria monocytogenes_ that caused infections was related by whole genome sequencing to isolates from samples taken from 37 rockmelons from the farm. _Listeria_ also was found on the floor around the melon packing area and from a composite swab of washed melons. All _Listeria_-positives were identified as the outbreak strain.

Rockmelons are grown off the ground on plastic sheeting but are in the open farm environment and subject to rain, wind and other natural contamination.

A NSW Department of Primary Industries (DPI) report found that hygiene and sanitation practices at Rombola Family Farms were on par with, or better than, most other rockmelon growers in Australia.

Adverse weather events listed as heavy rainfall in December 2017 prior to harvest, followed by dust storms, were blamed for increasing the organic load and amount of _Listeria_ on rockmelons prior to harvest. Another issue is the netted skin of the fruit, making it harder to clean and sanitize.

"Prior to the detection of the outbreak, RFF utilized a one minute and 30-40 second pre-wash and scrubbing step to reduce organic load, followed by a 35 second sanitizing step of 100 ppm chlorine sprays and scrubbing," said the NSW DPI report.

"It is likely that the 35 seconds at 100 ppm sanitizing step was effective in reducing _Listeria monocytogenes_ to a very low level, but these levels still resulted in illness when rockmelons were consumed by immunocompromised individuals."

Wash water was not recirculated; sanitizer was constantly monitored and applied through an auto-dosing system, and all water coming into the facility was treated and considered potable, the report says.

Dirty fans used to reduce moisture levels on melons after washing and some spongy material on packing tables that was not easily cleaned may have been contributing factors to the outbreak but are not considered to be major underlying causes, investigators reported.

NSW Food Authority inspections found that there was an opportunity for introduction of _Listeria_ after washing through contact with surfaces or equipment that may have had traces of the pathogen. This included dust blown from fans to dry the fruit after washing and from porous material on packing tables that was not able to be effectively cleaned.

"During the investigation, there was an allegation of raw organic fertilizer use on the rockmelon crop, which was found to be incorrect," the agency report said.

The business resumed harvesting and packing in early April 2018, and no _Listeria monocytogenes_ has been detected on any fruit since then.

Rombola Family Farms has made line modifications to improve cleaning, increased cleaning and sanitizing of the packing line environment and sanitizer concentration during washing of melons.

"The rockmelon pre-wash was dosed with 200 ppm chlorine water during use. Similarly, the concentration of chlorine in the sanitizer wash step was increased to 200 ppm. This gives a total contact time for chlorine of over 2 minutes," according to the NSW DPI report.

"The fungicide tank and post wash drying fans have been made more accessible and easily cleaned. Black sponge material on the packing table has been removed and replaced with more suitable material."

[The news report says heavy rainfall and dust storms resulted in _Listeria moncytogenes_ contamination of rockmelons (also called cantaloupe) produced by a specific grower, Rombola Family Farms in southern New South Wales, Australia. As a result, 22 individuals in Australia were infected between Jan and April 2018 by eating the contaminated melons. Seven infected individuals died, and one miscarried.

_Listeria_ is a fecal organism of farm animals and humans and is found in grazing land and farmland that has been fertilized with manure. _Listeria_ can survive for up to 84 days in some soils (https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0075969). Raw organic fertilizer was reportedly not used at the Rombola farm. However, because cantaloupes grow on vines on the ground, even if separated from the soil by plastic sheeting as was the case at the Rombola farm, cantaloupe could possibly be susceptible to contamination with bacteria from animal feces in soil that was carried from surrounding grazing land or farmland by heavy rainwater runoff or dust storms.

Cantaloupe could also become contaminated in processing facilities if _Listeria_ are brought into the facility by a dust storm or on the soles of workers' shoes, or if the facility is flooded by heavy rain runoff. In fact, the outbreak stain of _Listeria_ was found on the floor around the Rombola melon packing area. Cantaloupe's rough surface could then impede effective cleaning. However, inspectors at the Rombola farm found there was an opportunity for introduction of _Listeria_ after washing cantaloupe through contact with surfaces or equipment that may have had traces of the pathogen. - Mod.ML
