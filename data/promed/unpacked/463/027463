Kenya: cases of o'nyong-nyong fever confirmed
---------------------------------------------
15 cases of o'nyong-nyong fever have been confirmed in the Coast Province
of Kenya. The cases are from Mombasa and Malindi. There have been no
deaths. The presenting features are similar to malaria, but they have
extreme joint pain. Treatment is basically symptomatic.

[In the previous post, it was stated by the moderator that: "O'nyong-nyong
virus is geographically restricted to East Africa, whereas Chikungunya
virus is more widely distributed, causing extensive epidemics in south-east
Asia and India as well as in southeast Africa and sub-Saharan Africa."
However, an examination by Woodruff AW, Bowen ET, Platt GS (Br Med J. 1978
Apr 15;1(6118):956-8) of sera from 86 travelers to Britain from tropical
Africa revealed evidence of past infection with 10 identifiable viruses, of
which the most important were o'nyong-nyong, dengue, chikungunya, and Ntaya
viruses. Their findings indicated that infection with o'nyong-nyong virus
may be acquired sporadically in Nigeria, Ghana, and Sierra Leone, where it
has not previously been identified.
Furthermore, the Institute Pasteur isolated o'nyong-nyong virus from
sentinel mice in Senegal, and a strain of this virus called Igbo Ora virus
caused an epidemic in the Ivory Coast in 1984-85. It is likely, therefore,
that o'nyong-nyong virus occurs across Africa from coast to coast. - Mod.JW]
