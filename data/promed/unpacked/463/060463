Viet Nam reports anthrax in northern locality
---------------------------------------------
Viet Nam's northern Ha Giang province, some 320 km [about 200 mi due] north of the capital Hanoi, reported 9 cases of anthrax in humans related to consumption of meat from dead livestock.

During [17 Sep to 9 Oct 2014], medical centers in Meo Vac District in Ha Giang reported 9 cases with clinical presentation of cutaneous anthrax. No fatality was record so far, according to Viet Nam's state-run news agency VNA on [Tue 14 Oct 2014]. Among the 9 cases, there are 4 men aged between 24 and 30, and 5 children, reported VNA.

The medical agencies of Ha Giang have implemented preventive measures and sent samples to the National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology for diagnosis.

Anthrax is a disease caused by bacteria [_Bacillus anthracis_]. Cutaneous anthrax presents a boil-like skin lesion that eventually forms an ulcer with a black center.

[Anthrax has long been a chronic problem in the northern provinces of Viet Nam. To find Ha Giang, on the border with China>, go to http://www.onlineasiatravel.com/images/vn/vietnam-map.png. It is a mountainous province with narrow valleys (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%A0_Giang_Province). Meo Vac district is remote but enjoys a Sunday cattle market (see http://vietnamhagiang.com/).

While outbreaks of anthrax in northern Viet Nam are sporadic, they can sometimes get out of hand as vaccination has ceased to be a routine. And this is accompanied by multiple human cases, such as 52+ in Dien Bien Province in 2011, and 13 cases with 2 deaths in Ha Giang in 2008. - Mod.MHJ
