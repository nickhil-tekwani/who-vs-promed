An Osage man already facing multiple sexual abuse charges has now been charged with the attempted murder of the alleged victim set to testify against him in the case.

The perpetrator, 50, is being held in the Mitchell County Jail without bond on the charge, a Class B felony. Charges were filed Friday [12 Jun 2015] in Mitchell County District Court. He also faces 2 new sexual abuse charges, according to complaints filed in Mitchell County District Court.

According to the complaint, the perpetrator was allegedly planning to give the toxin ricin to the victim, who also lives in Osage.

The complaint says an individual reported to a county deputy that the perpetrator had told him [the informant] that he [the perpetrator] wanted to kill the victim, who was to testify in the pending sexual abuse case against the perpetrator.

"The individual stated that the perpetrator had spoken with him [the informant] about a television episode of Breaking Bad where castor beans had been used to make ricin. The individual stated that the perpetrator ordered some castor beans online and ... he [the informant] had seen the castor beans in a refrigerator inside the perpetrator's house.

"The individual stated that approximately one week ago, the perpetrator also removed a pill bottle containing castor beans from his pants pocket and showed it to him. The individual stated that he had also seen paperwork that the perpetrator had which described how to extract ricin from castor beans and how to make ricin."

The perpetrator allegedly also asked the individual in the complaint to obtain heroin so it could be mixed with the ricin "and taken over to (the victim)'s residence where it would ultimately be used to kill (the victim)."

During a search of the perpetrator's residence on 12 Jun 2015, castor beans were allegedly found inside a pants pocket, as well as a note listing several items including duct tape, 50 to 60 large Hefty bags, saws with new blades, a power cord; 2 5-gallon containers of gasoline, large tarps, a vacuum sealer, and USD 220 in cash.

Many of the items, including duct tape, saws, power cords, garbage bags, gasoline containers, tarps and shrink wrap, were found in the residence during the search.

Also allegedly found was documentation on how to extract ricin from castor beans.

The perpetrator also faces a new 3rd-degree sexual abuse charge, a Class C felony. The complaint alleges the abuse took place on 5 separate occasions in the past 30 days.

He also faces a charge of sexual exploitation by a counselor or therapist, a Class D felony. The perpetrator had been acting as sponsor of a victim for Alcoholics Anonymous and the complaint said he "engaged in sexual conduct with the defendant against his will on multiple occasions" in the past 30 days.

The perpetrator is already facing an earlier set of charges filed in February 2015, and his trial is scheduled for 19 Aug 2015.

In that case, he faces a charge of 2nd-degree sexual assault, a Class B felony; 2 counts of 3rd-degree sexual abuse, a Class C felony; one charge of 3rd-degree sexual abuse-victim age 12-13, a Class C felony; and solicitation, a Class D felony.

Two sets of charges, filed by the city of Osage and Mitchell County separately were consolidated in early March 2015.

Offense dates are listed in 2003, 2006 and 2012.

A US man who sent a romantic rival a scratch-and-sniff birthday card laced with the deadly poison ricin was sentenced Monday [15 Jun 2015] to 20 to 40 years in prison.

The perpetrator, 20, of Hatboro in suburban Philadelphia, wept as he said goodbye to his family after being sentenced in Bucks County Court, The Philadelphia Inquirer reported.

The perpetrator pleaded guilty in November 2015 to attempted murder, attempted aggravated assault, risking a catastrophe and other crimes.

Prosecutors said he laced a card with a lethal dose of homemade ricin in March 2014, then walked 8 miles to the Warminster home of a man dating his ex-girlfriend and put the card in the mailbox. The perpetrator bragged about the plot to a co-worker, who alerted police, prosecutors said. Authorities stopped the rival from opening the card, and he wasn't injured.

The perpetrator tearfully told the judge he was "extremely sorry" and wished he could "turn back the clock. I don't know how or why my mind came to this awful decision," he said.

Months after his arrest, the perpetrator was charged with asking a fellow inmate to kill an investigating detective and rip out the tongue of the prosecutor. He acknowledged in court having threatened other witnesses and co-workers.

The perpetrator said a fellow inmate counseled him to write such a letter, arguing that he could avoid prison by writing a "crazy" letter that would get him sent to a mental health facility.

Judge Alan Rubenstein displayed little sympathy, calling his crimes "extraordinary" and comparing them to actions of would-be terrorists recruited over the Internet.

"You are bright. You are articulate. You are responsive," Judge Rubenstein said. "But I don't think you appreciate the damage you have caused to people very close to you." The judge said, however, that he would recommend that he be sent to a Luzerne County facility with a strong mental health program.

[There is no law against having castor bean plants. They are beautiful, hearty plants. However, if a pet ingests a seed, and cracks it, the pet faces a potentially lethal outcome, especially without immediate emergency care.

It should be noted that castor oil has no ricin in it.

The reference to "Breaking Bad" is a television show that aired some time ago and includes reruns of seeking revenge using ricin. There have been several convictions of people acting on scenarios based on this television show.

Ricin is a poison found naturally in castor beans. If castor beans are chewed and swallowed, the released ricin can cause injury. Ricin can be made from the waste material left over from processing castor beans. It is a potent protein derived from the beans of the castor plant (_Ricinus communis_). Castor beans are used in the production of castor oil, a brake and hydraulic fluid constituent. The aqueous phase of the process, termed the "waste mash," is 5-10 percent ricin. Ricin works by getting inside the cells of a person's body and preventing the cells from making the proteins they need, hence, it is often called a toxalbumin. Without the proteins, cells die. Eventually this is harmful to the whole body, and death may occur.

Ricin can be in the form of a powder, a mist, or a pellet, or it can be dissolved in water or weak acid. It is a stable substance under normal conditions, but can be inactivated by heat above 80 C [176 F].

Ricin has been used experimentally in medicine to kill cancer cells.

Effects of ricin poisoning depend on whether ricin was inhaled, ingested, or injected. The major symptoms of ricin poisoning depend on the route of exposure and the dose received, though many organs may be affected in severe cases. Initial symptoms of ricin poisoning by inhalation may occur within 8 hours of exposure. Following ingestion of ricin, initial symptoms typically occur in less than 6 hours.

Inhalation: within a few hours of inhaling significant amounts of ricin, the likely symptoms would be respiratory distress (difficulty breathing), fever, cough, nausea, and tightness in the chest. Heavy sweating may follow as well as fluid is building up in the lungs (pulmonary edema). This would make breathing even more difficult, and the skin might turn blue. Excess fluid in the lungs would be diagnosed by x-ray or by listening to the chest with a stethoscope. Finally, low blood pressure and respiratory failure may occur, leading to death. In cases of known exposure to ricin, people having respiratory symptoms that started within 12 hours of inhaling ricin should seek medical care.

Ingestion: if someone swallows a significant amount of ricin, he or she would develop vomiting and diarrhea that may become bloody. Severe dehydration may be the result, followed by low blood pressure. Other signs or symptoms may include hallucinations, seizures, and blood in the urine. Within several days, the person's liver, spleen, and kidneys might stop working, and the person could die.

Skin and eye exposure: ricin is unlikely to be absorbed through normal skin. Contact with ricin powders or products may cause redness and pain of the skin and the eyes.

Death from ricin poisoning could take place within 36 to 72 hours of exposure, depending on the route of exposure (inhalation, ingestion, or injection) and the dose received.

In suspected situations where ricin may have been disseminated, preliminary environmental testing by public health or law enforcement authorities may detect ricin in powders or materials released into the immediate environment. Persons occupying such areas may initially be observed for signs of ricin poisoning.

No widely available, reliable medical test exists to confirm that a person has been exposed to ricin.

Because no antidote exists for ricin, the most important factor is avoiding ricin exposure in the 1st place. If exposure cannot be avoided, the most important factor is then getting the ricin off or out of the body as quickly as possible.

Symptomatic ricin poisoning is treated by giving victims supportive medical care to minimize the effects of the poisoning. The types of supportive medical care would depend on several factors, such as the route by which victims were poisoned (that is, whether poisoning was by inhalation, ingestion, or skin or eye exposure). Care could include such measures as helping victims breathe, giving them intravenous fluids (fluids given through a needle inserted into a vein), giving them medications to treat conditions such as seizures and low blood pressure, flushing their stomachs with activated charcoal (if the ricin has been very recently ingested), or washing out their eyes with water if their eyes are irritated.
