[1] COVID strain naming
Date: Mon 31 May 2021

All viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, change over time. Most changes have little or no impact on the virus's properties. However, some changes may affect the virus's properties, such as how easily it spreads, the associated disease severity, or the performance of vaccines, therapeutic medicines, diagnostic tools, or other public health and social measures.

WHO, in collaboration with partners, expert networks, national authorities, institutions and researchers have been monitoring and assessing the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 since January 2020. During late 2020, the emergence of variants that posed an increased risk to global public health prompted the characterisation of specific variants of interest (VOIs) and variants of concern (VOCs), in order to prioritise global monitoring and research, and ultimately to inform the ongoing response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

WHO and its international networks of experts are monitoring changes to the virus so that if significant mutations are identified, we can inform countries and the public about any changes needed to react to the variant, and prevent its spread. Globally, systems have been established and are being strengthened to detect "signals" of potential VOIs or VOCs and assess these based on the risk posed to global public health. National authorities may choose to designate other variants of local interest/concern.

Current strategies and measures recommended by WHO continue to work against virus variants identified since the start of the pandemic.

The established nomenclature systems for naming and tracking SARS-CoV-2 genetic lineages by GISAID, Nextstrain, and Pango are currently and will remain in use by scientists and in scientific research. To assist with public discussions of variants, WHO convened a group of scientists from the WHO Virus Evolution Working Group, the WHO COVID-19 reference laboratory network, representatives from GISAID, Nextstrain, Pango, and additional experts in virological, microbial nomenclature and communication from several countries and agencies to consider easy-to-pronounce and non-stigmatising labels for VOI and VOC. At the present time, this expert group convened by WHO has recommended using letters of the Greek Alphabet -- that is, Alpha, Beta, Gamma, which will be easier and more practical to discuss by non-scientific audiences.

[2] Viet Nam, flights, testing
[A] Suspension of international flights
Date: Mon 31 May 2021

https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2021/05/31/Vietnam-suspends-some-international-flights-after-discovering-very-dangerous-coronavirus-variant-combining-india-and-uk-strains/


Viet Nam will suspend international flights into its capital city Hanoi this week and tighten restrictions in the city amid a new surge of Covid-19 cases, the government announced on Mon 31 May 2021, as the country -- which has had among the lowest Covid-19 case numbers in the world -- faces a new coronavirus variant mixing those first detected in India and the United Kingdom.

Flights into Hanoi will be suspended from 1-7 Jun 2021, and the US Embassy in Viet Nam reports international flights into Ho Chi Minh City are also suspended until 14 Jun 2021. Hanoi imposed new restrictions after Ho Chi Minh City expanded its restrictions on Sun 30 May 2021 for at least 2 weeks and announced it will test its entire population of 9 million people for Covid-19. Ho Chi Minh City's outbreak is linked to a religious mission in the city that has so far been linked to the majority of the city's cases, at least 125, the government said Sun [30 May 2021].

The new restrictions come right after the country revealed it had discovered a new coronavirus variant, which Viet Nam's health minister said combines "characteristics of the 2 existing variants first found in India and the UK". The fact the new strain "is an Indian variant with mutations that originally belong to the UK variant" makes the variant "very dangerous", and it is more transmissible than previous known forms of the coronavirus, health minister Nguyen Thanh Long said in a government meeting, a recording of which was reported by Reuters.

The World Health Organization said on Mon 31 May 2021 that 4 cases of the mutation had been detected among 32 samples from people in northern Viet Nam who were infected with the B.1.617 variant 1st detected in India, and the organization is monitoring the new mutation.

Viet Nam has recorded 7236 Covid-19 cases, with 47 deaths, since the start of the pandemic, according to Johns Hopkins University. Viet Nam had previously been hailed as one of the most successful at managing the pandemic; the country went 3 months without recording any domestic Covid-19 cases in the fall and didn't record its first deaths until August 2020. More than half of its cases have been recorded since late April 2021, when the current surge began.

Viet Nam's outbreak could potentially disrupt the tech supply chain if it continues, Reuters reports, as the new surge has led to staffing shortages in factories that manufacture supplies for companies like Apple and Samsung. A current workaround by one Apple supplier to split its workforce was a "temporary solution, for maybe 2 weeks," one source told Reuters. "Otherwise, the supply chain will be more or less disrupted."

The B.1.617 variant 1st detected in India and B.1.1.7 variant 1st detected in the UK are 2 of the variants WHO has identified as "variants of concern", though it has not yet made a determination on the variant mutation found in Viet Nam. A recent study found that the Pfizer and AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccines are considered to largely protect against both variants, though there's a fairly low efficacy rate after the first dose, and the Moderna vaccine is considered to be protective against the new strains as well. Viet Nam still has a fairly low vaccination rate, with only about 1 million doses administered and less than 0.1% of the country's population fully vaccinated, according to public health data compiled by the New York Times.

[B] Testing
Date: Mon 31 May 2021
Source: Business Standard [abridged, edited]
https://www.business-standard.com/article/international/Vietnam-to-test-all-9-million-residents-for-coronavirus-in-largest-city-121053100442_1.html


Viet Nam plans to test all 9 million people in its largest city for the coronavirus and imposed more restrictions Monday to deal with a growing Covid-19 outbreak. People in Ho Chi Minh city are only allowed to leave home for necessary activities, and public gatherings of more than 10 people are banned for the next 2 weeks, the government announced. Prior to the order, the city, [which is] Viet Nam's economic hub, shut down non-essential business when cases started to increase.

State newspaper Viet Nam News said the city authority is planning to test its entire population with a testing capacity of 100 000 samples a day. The newspaper also said police had filed a case Sun [30 May 2021] against a couple who head a Protestant church mission for spreading dangerous infectious diseases, citing poor health protocols applied at the premises. At least 145 cases of coronavirus infection have been reported with links to the Revival Ekklesia Mission, a Protestant sect, and the city district of Go Vap, where the church is based, has been locked down. Viet Nam has since banned all religious events nationwide. The newspaper said church followers gathered in a small space for singing and chanting without proper distancing and mask wearing. Ho Chi Minh city police said the mission has 48 registered members. The report said the husband and wife accused in the case were responsible for leading and organizing activities at the church. They were not identified and are not under arrest.

Since the end of April 2021, a surge in COVID-19 has spread to 31 municipalities and provinces in Viet Nam with over 4000 cases, almost twice the total that the country reported since the beginning of the pandemic. Some recent patients in Viet Nam were infected with a hybrid of the virus variants first found in India and the UK, the health minister Nguyen Thanh Long said, [adding that] the hybrid might spread more easily and could be responsible for Viet Nam's recent surge.

Viruses often develop small genetic changes as they reproduce, and new variants of the coronavirus have been seen almost since it was first detected in China in late 2019. WHO has categorized the UK and the Indian variants, along with 2 others first found in South Africa and Brazil, as variants of concern because they appear to be more contagious. Viet Nam has vaccinated one million people with AstraZeneca shots. It has a deal with Pfizer for 30 million doses to be delivered later this year [2021]. It is also in talks with Moderna that would give it enough shots to fully vaccinate 80% of its 96 million people.

[Testing 9 million residents will be a challenge. By the time the last residents are tested, the 1st group may have become infected. The vaccination rate in Viet Nam is extremely low, with 0.1% having had a single dose, and less having had 2 vaccinations (Our World in Data) to an estimate of 0.5% (Reuters). Either way, the population is highly susceptible. - Mod.LK]

"Summary
"Background
The banning of mass-gathering indoor events to prevent SARS-CoV-2 spread has had an important effect on local economies. Despite growing evidence on the suitability of antigen-detecting rapid diagnostic tests (Ag-RDT) for mass screening at the event entry, this strategy has not been assessed under controlled conditions. We aimed to assess the effectiveness of a prevention strategy during a live indoor concert.

"Methods
We designed a randomised controlled open-label trial to assess the effectiveness of a comprehensive preventive intervention for a mass-gathering indoor event (a live concert) based on systematic same-day screening of attendees with Ag-RDTs, use of facial masks, and adequate air ventilation. The event took place in the Sala Apolo, Barcelona, Spain. Adults aged 18-59 years with a negative result in an Ag-RDT from a nasopharyngeal swab collected immediately before entering the event were randomised 1:1 (block randomisation stratified by age and gender) to either attend the indoor event for 5 hours or go home. Nasopharyngeal specimens used for Ag-RDT screening were analysed by real-time reverse-transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) and cell culture (Vero E6 cells). Eight days after the event, a nasopharyngeal swab was collected and analysed by Ag-RDT, RT-PCR, and a transcription-mediated amplification test (TMA). The primary outcome was the difference in incidence of RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection at 8 days between the control and the intervention groups, assessed in all participants who were randomly assigned, attended the event, and had a valid result for the SARS-CoV-2 test done at follow-up. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04668625.

"Findings
Participant enrollment took place during the morning of the day of the concert, 12 Dec 2020. Of the 1140 people who responded to the call and were deemed eligible, 1047 were randomly assigned to either enter the music event (experimental group) or continue with normal life (control group). Of the 523 randomly assigned to the experimental group, 465 were included in the analysis of the primary outcome (51 did not enter the event and 8 did not take part in the follow-up assessment), and of the 524 randomly assigned to the control group, 495 were included in the final analysis (29 did not take part in the follow-up). At baseline, 15 (3%) of 495 individuals in the control group and 13 (3%) of 465 in the experimental group tested positive on TMA despite a negative Ag-RDT result. The RT-PCR test was positive in one case in each group and cell viral culture was negative in all cases. 8 days after the event, 2 (under 1%) individuals in the control arm had a positive Ag-RDT and PCR result, whereas no Ag-RDT nor RT-PCR positive results were found in the intervention arm. The Bayesian estimate for the incidence between the experimental and control groups was -0.15% (95% CI -0.72 to 0.44).

"Interpretation
Our study provides preliminary evidence on the safety of indoor mass-gathering events during a COVID-19 outbreak under a comprehensive preventive intervention. The data could help restart cultural activities halted during COVID-19, which might have important sociocultural and economic implications."

ref: Lekpa FK, Njonnou SRS, Balti E, et al. Negative antigen RDT and RT-PCR results do not rule out COVID-19 if clinical suspicion is strong. Lancet Infectious Diseases. Published: 28 May2021 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S1473-3099(21)00271-1

"We read with interest the Article by Yap Boum and colleagues (1) which brought significant insight into the importance of rapid diagnostic tests for SARS-CoV-2. Boum and colleagues provided useful information about the patterns of patient presentation. However, some important considerations lead us to suggest an improvement to the algorithm they describe in figure 2A. (1)

"Our feeling is that the clinical context for the suspicion of COVID-19 warrants consideration. Indeed, it is not unusual to see patients with a suggestive clinical presentation, with or without chest CT imaging features suggestive of COVID-19, but negative rapid diagnostic or RT-PCR test results. (2)

"These false-negative results could be explained by a number of factors: viral load, which is associated with disease course and disease severity; sputum or throat swab sample quality, which must contain sufficient cellular material for detection; kit performance; sample transportation and sample storage conditions; lack of standardised operating procedures; interpretation of results; and quality-control issues. (2)

"Moreover, patients with high platelet counts or C-reactive protein levels are at increased risk of having false-negative 1st RT-PCR results. (3) Finally, in the presence of a negative screening result for SARS-CoV-2, clinicians should not ignore potential differential diagnoses, which should be ruled out. As shown in the appendix, we propose in case of strong clinical suspicion but negative antigen rapid diagnostic tests or RT-PCR results that the patient is re-sampled by a different operator from the one who did the 1st test. (4)

"Furthermore, adding antibody-based tests to the proposed armamentarium of diagnostic tools for COVID-19 in symptomatic individuals could improve the positive predictive value of the whole strategy. Also, in patients with a high clinical suspicion, performing up to 3 tests, as suggested by some authors, (5) would be wise before ruling out the diagnosis. Nevertheless, if clinical suspicion remains strong, chest CT imaging should be done, even in resource-limited settings, because of its reasonably good sensitivity and severity-grading role.

"Besides discussing strategies to improve the performance of the proposed algorithm, we would like to point out that the comparison of the different screening tests could have been improved by consideration of discrimination assessment methods. For instance, the authors report sensitivities and specificities of the various strategies in table 5. Assessing C-statistics, integrated discrimination improvement, and net reclassification indices could have given better insight to the data. However, the accuracy of these estimates requires an appropriate sample size, which is a prerequisite to their interpretation."

Performance and operational feasibility of antigen and antibody rapid diagnostic tests for COVID-19 in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients in Cameroon: a clinical, prospective, diagnostic accuracy study. Lancet Infect Dis 2021; published online 25 Mar 2021. https://doi.org/10.1016/ S1473-3099(21)00132-8.

"Summary
Background
Real-time PCR is recommended to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, PCR availability is restricted in most countries. Rapid diagnostic tests are considered acceptable alternatives, but data are lacking on their performance. We assessed the performance of 4 antibody-based rapid diagnostic tests and one antigen-based rapid diagnostic test for detecting SARS-CoV-2 infection in the community in Cameroon.

"Methods
In this clinical, prospective, diagnostic accuracy study, we enrolled individuals aged at least 21 years who were either symptomatic and suspected of having COVID-19 or asymptomatic and presented for screening. We tested peripheral blood for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using the Innovita (Biological Technology; Beijing, China), Wondfo (Guangzhou Wondfo Biotech; Guangzhou, China), SD Biosensor (SD Biosensor; Gyeonggi-do, South Korea), and Runkun tests (Runkun Pharmaceutical; Hunan, China), and nasopharyngeal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 antigen using the SD Biosensor test. Antigen rapid diagnostic tests were compared with Abbott PCR testing (Abbott; Abbott Park, IL, USA), and antibody rapid diagnostic tests were compared with Biomerieux immunoassays (Biomerieux; Marcy l'Etoile, France). We retrospectively tested 2 diagnostic algorithms that incorporated rapid diagnostic tests for symptomatic and asymptomatic patients using simulation modelling.

"Findings
1195 participants were enrolled in the study. 347 (29%) tested SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive, 223 (19%) rapid diagnostic test antigen-positive, and 478 (40%) rapid diagnostic test antibody-positive. Antigen-based rapid diagnostic test sensitivity was 80.0% (95% CI 71.0-88.0) in the 1st 7 days after symptom onset, but antibody-based rapid diagnostic tests had only 26.8% sensitivity (18.3-36.8). Antibody rapid diagnostic test sensitivity increased to 76.4% (70.1-82.0) 14 days after symptom onset. Among asymptomatic participants, the sensitivity of antigen-based and antibody-based rapid diagnostic tests were 37.0% (27.0-48.0) and 50.7% (42.2-59.1), respectively. Cohen's k showed substantial agreement between Wondfo antibody rapid diagnostic test and gold-standard ELISA (k=0.76; sensitivity 0.98) and between Biosensor and ELISA (k=0.60; sensitivity 0.94). Innovita (k=0.47; sensitivity 0.93) and Runkun (k=0.43; sensitivity 0.76) showed moderate agreement. An antigen-based retrospective algorithm applied to symptomatic patients showed 94.0% sensitivity and 91.0% specificity in the 1st 7 days after symptom onset. For asymptomatic participants, the algorithm showed a sensitivity of 34% (95% CI 23.0-44.0) and a specificity of 92.0% (88.0-96.0).

"Interpretation
Rapid diagnostic tests had good overall sensitivity for diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection. Rapid diagnostic tests could be incorporated into efficient testing algorithms as an alternative to PCR to decrease diagnostic delays and onward viral transmission."

In general, if clinical symptoms are suggestive of COVID and the first laboratory test conducted is negative, it is important to conduct additional tests. Knowing time following onset of symptoms is important in interpretation of test results. Rapid tests are very valuable in the case of large events with a high number of attendees. One such event is the upcoming Olympics in Japan, where attendees including athletes, coaches, journalists could all be tested using a rapid test before they are permitted to enter the stadium. - Mod.LK]

[In the past 24 hours, 4 countries including India (126 698), Brazil (32 554), Argentina (28 175), Colombia (23 177) and Iran (11 024) have reported the highest numbers of cases, all reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. A global total of 8181 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (late 29 May 2021 to late 30 May 2021). A total of 46 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 23 of the 48 countries are from the European region, 8 are from the Americas region, 8 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 5 are from the Southeast Asia region, 3 are from the Western Pacific region, and one from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased by 1.04%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 5.8 %. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 5.4% decrease in daily reported cases and a 37.8% increase in reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily total: Over 390 000 newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours, with over 171.45 million cumulative reported cases and over 3.56 million reported deaths. - Mod.UBA]
