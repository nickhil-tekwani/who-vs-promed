Avian influenza in Ghana: the H5N1 strain isolated shows no new
introduction of the virus to Africa
-----------------------------------------------
The analysis of the H5N1 avian influenza strain isolated from the
outbreak occurring in Ghana clearly indicates that it is closely
related to other isolates from Sub-Saharan African countries like
Ivory Coast, Sudan, Burkina Faso and Nigeria and that it is less
similar to the Asian strains currently isolated.
"The sequencing of the Ghana strain indicates that there is a
similarity range between 98.8 percent and 99.6 percent to other
isolates from Sub-Saharan African countries," the Director general of
the OIE, Dr. Bernard Vallat, said today [18 May 2007]. "That would
indicate that there has been no introduction of a new virus strain to
Ghana," he added.
The OIE continues to emphasize that surveillance supported by
efficient veterinary services is crucial for the early detection of
avian influenza and for a rapid response to be carried out in order
to prevent any further spread of the disease. In addition, the
organization recalled that transparent sharing of virus samples for
sequencing is key to tracking the least genetic evolution of the
virus and trigger appropriate global response mechanisms.
Ghana authorities were quick to notify the OIE of the occurrence of
the outbreak in their territory on 12 May 2007; samples were sent in
a timely manner to the reference laboratory, and the sequencing of
the virus was finalized by the OIE Reference Laboratory for avian
influenza in Padua (Italy) on Wed 16 May 2007.

and possibly illegal commercial origin and not due to migratory
