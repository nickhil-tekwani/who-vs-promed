Since our crop is now maturing and the risk of crop damage is reduced, some
of the panic caused by the rust outbreak is now subsiding. The winter will
be used to take stock of the situation and implement control measures and
research programs. A producer education program will also have to be
implemented.
The short- to medium-term producers will have to rely on chemical control;
at this stage flusilazole/carbendazim and tebuconazole have received
emergency registration, with some others in the pipeline. The registered
rates are quite high (200/100 g [active ingredient/ha in the case of
flusilazole/carbendazim) because of a fear of sub-lethal doses and
resistance in the pathogen population. There appears to be some opposition
to these rates because lower rates appear to be effective in Zimbabwe.
I have not had time to review the probability of resistance build-up; if
any subscribers can help in this regard I would be grateful. Should
resistance to chemicals occur, it would devastate the industry, as I do not
foresee host resistance being available for a while.
Some of the aspects that we will probably be researching include
overwintering and the epidemiological significance of distance of inoculum
source from certain production areas (escape strategies??), sources of
resistance, races, prediction models, and optimizing spray regimes (new
chemicals, timing, rates, economics, etc.). We are interested in
collaboration with interested parties.
The disease has been identified throughout most of the KwaZulu-Natal
production areas, having initially been recorded in the Vryheid area on 1
Mar 2001, Kaarkloof on 5 March, and subsequently in Piet Retief, Greytown,
Cedara, Merryvale, and Bergville areas. I have an unconfirmed report of
rust in the Amersfoort area, which means that our Highveld production areas
are also under threat. The disease is not going to go away, and we will
have to learn to deal with it quickly.
