Assistant Public Health Minister Dr Jerip Susil said sharp increases in malaria cases were recorded in Penrissen and Padawan in the Kuching Division [Sarawak state].

The Bengoh assemblyman said for the 1st half of this year [2013], the number of malaria cases in the 2 areas rose by 75 per cent compared with the corresponding period last year [2012], but did not have the exact figures on hand.

"It is quite alarming and for preventive measures the Health Department has been going to the ground and conducting fogging in the affected residential areas," he told reporters after opening the centralised Padawan Municipal Council (MPP) Ramadan Bazaar at Kota Sentosa yesterday [10 Jul 2013].

He urged private medical practitioners to record and file reports on malaria detection, especially in the areas concerned, to the relevant authorities so that immediate action could be taken.

[Kuching is located in the part of Malaysia located in Sarawak (northern Borneo). According to the World Malaria Report 2012 (WHO, 2013 http://www.who.int/malaria/publications/world_malaria_report_2012/wmr2012_country_profiles.pdf) the endemicity in the area is marked as 0.1-1 case per 1000 population per year. It is not possible to determine whether the number of cases is within this range without knowing the number of cases. - Mod.EP
