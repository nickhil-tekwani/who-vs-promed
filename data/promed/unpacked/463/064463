Abstract
--------
The hydrophobic character and electrophoretic mobility (EPM) of microorganisms are vital aspects of understanding their interactions with the environment. These properties are fundamental in fate-and-transport, physiological, and virulence studies, and thus integral in surrogate selection. Hydrophobic and electrostatic forces are significant contributors to particle and microorganism mobility in the environment. Herein, the surface properties of commonly used _Bacillus anthracis_ surrogate endospores were tested under comparable conditions with respect to culture, endospore purification, buffer type and strength. Additionally, data is presented of endospores suspended in dechlorinated tap water to evaluate the surrogates in regard to a breach of water infrastructure security. The surface properties of _B. anthracis_ were found to be the most hydrophobic and least electronegative among the 6 _Bacillus_ species tested across buffer strength. The effect of EPM on hydrophobicity varies in a species-specific manner. This study demonstrates that surrogate surface properties differ and care must be taken when choosing the most suitable surrogate. Moreover, it is shown that _Bacillus thuringensis_ best represents _Bacillus anthracis_-Sterne with respect to both EPM and hydrophobicity across all test buffers.

[This is a very interesting paper as it ranks _B. anthracis_ 's hydrophobicity above those of other _Bacillus_ species, while at the same time having the lowest electronegativity. In practical terms this means that the spores are more subject to water flow movements, such as from a buried carcass up to the grazing root mass, than holding on organic matter in the soil. Our thanks to Gene for bring this valuable paper to our notice. - Mod.MHJ]

Abstract
--------
Environmental reservoirs are essential in the maintenance and transmission of anthrax but are poorly characterized. The anthrax agent, _Bacillus anthracis_ was long considered an obligate pathogen that is dormant and passively transmitted in the environment. However, a growing number of laboratory studies indicate that, like some of its close relatives, _B. anthracis_ has some activity outside of its vertebrate hosts. Here we show in the field that _B. anthracis_ has significant interactions with a grass that could promote anthrax spore transmission to grazing hosts. Using a local, virulent strain of _B. anthracis_, we performed a field experiment in an enclosure within a grassland savanna. We found that _B. anthracis_ increased the rate of establishment of a native grass (_Enneapogon desvauxii_) by 50 percent and that grass seeds exposed to blood reached heights that were 45 percent taller than controls. Further we detected significant effects of _E. desvauxii_, _B. anthracis_, and their interaction on soil bacterial taxa richness and community composition. We did not find any evidence for multiplication or increased longevity of _B. anthracis_ in bulk soil associated with grass compared to controls. Instead interactions between _B. anthracis_ and plants may result in increased host grazing and subsequently increased transmission to hosts.

Discussion
----------
Inspired by recent laboratory findings [5,6,8] that suggest that _B. anthracis_ may have activity outside of a vertebrate host, we explored interactions between a native grass and _B. anthracis_ in an experimental field enclosure. We tested the hypothesis that carcass materials, such as _B. anthracis_ and zebra blood, might increase grass growth. We found that the addition of _B. anthracis_ spores to soil containing _E. desvauxii_ seeds substantially increased its rate of establishment. In addition, we found that the addition of zebra blood to soil increased grass height. Prior studies in North America showed increased plant biomass at carcass sites in response to nutrient deposition from a carcass [21-23]. Thus we hypothesized that the zebra blood might fertilize the grass. Nonetheless we were surprised to find that the treatment of _B. anthracis_ spores alone (without the nutrient addition that can be expected in the blood treatment) affected the rate of grass seedling establishment in our experimental plots.

In fact, the observation that _B. anthracis_ may have significant interactions with plants is not unexpected. Many _Bacillus_ species are known plant-growth promoting bacteria that exert beneficial effects on plant growth and development [47,48]. Various strains of _B. cereus_ have been introduced into soils, onto seeds, roots, tubers, and other planting materials in efforts to improve the growth of crops [49]. In addition to facilitating nutrient uptake and supplying growth-promoting substances to plant roots [50,51], plant-growth promoting bacteria can also induce systemic resistance, providing protection from plant pathogens and insects [52], and can improve drought tolerance [24-26].

We hypothesized that the presence of grass might reduce rate of decay of _B. anthracis_ in soil if there was replication in the rhizosphere or if the grass reduced the effects of weathering. While plants may provide a reservoir that promotes persistence of _B. thuringiensis_ and _B. anthracis_ in the environment [5,53], in concordance with previous studies, we found no evidence for multiplication or increased persistence of _B. anthracis_ in soil cores with _E. desvauxii_. Instead of providing an incubator for multiplication in the environment, the association with plants for _B. anthracis_ and _B. thuringiensis_ may be driven at least in part by increased likelihood of contact with herbivorous hosts [54]. However, when the grass was newly established in the experimental plots (3 months), we found that the addition of blood to the spore treatments significantly lowered the _B. anthracis_ CFU/g counts. Some of the _B. anthracis_ spores may have germinated in the soil in response to the nutrients from the blood and subsequently failed to replicate. Prior studies show that _B. anthracis_ spores germinate in water or soil augmented with viscera or blood from animals [3,4,55]. Vegetative cells have high nutrient requirements and may be unable to thrive outside a host without nutrient augmentation [55].

These findings suggest that naturally occurring anthrax carcass sites may exhibit increased plant establishment and productivity that potentially attracts grazing hosts to these infectious sites beyond that expected for uninfected carcass sites (Figure 7). In future studies, we will compare vegetation growth and host use of carcass sites that differ in the presence of _B. anthracis_. Herbivores selectively forage on vegetation in productive, nutrient rich soils in a heterogeneous landscape [56] and the carcass site is a primary source of environmental transmission of _B. anthracis_ to potential hosts. In his seminal research on anthrax in the late 19th century, Louis Pasteur identified carcass sites as a key area for anthrax transmission [15] and demonstrated that grazing animals can acquire anthrax infections by ingestion of abrasive plants inoculated with _B. anthracis_ [15]. Grazing hosts may come into contact with pathogens by ingesting soil along with the leaves and roots of plants [30] and pathogens may colonize the interior of plants [57]. Rain splash onto plants can provide a potential transmission route for pathogens in soil, such as _Salmonella enterica_ serovar Typhimurium [58]. Here we did not find detectable amounts of _B. anthracis_ on _E. desvauxii_ leaves. However, this may reflect our experimental design in which spores were narrowly deposited within a 5 cm [2 in] diameter and not widely spread out as would be expected at a carcass site. In addition to occurring on the leaf exterior, _Salmonella enterica_ serovar Typhimurium successfully invades the interior of tomato plants, providing another potential transmission route [57]. Determining whether _B. anthracis_ also colonizes the interior of plants would require similarly careful laboratory and greenhouse experiments.

Finally we tested whether _E. desvauxii_ or _B. anthracis_ affects the structure of bacterial communities occurring in bulk soil. Overall the bacterial communities were very similar; however, we detected significant effects of _E. desvauxii_ and _B. anthracis_ on OTU [operational taxonomic units] richness and bacterial community composition. Previously Saile and Koehler [5] showed in the laboratory that _B. anthracis_ germinates in the grass rhizosphere. It may be that the significant interaction that we detected between the spore and grass treatments on overall OTU richness reflects some activity of _B. anthracis_ in association with _E. desvauxii_. In addition, community composition in bulk soil associated with _E. desvauxii_ and _B. anthracis_ differed from controls. Bulk soil associated with _E. desvauxii_ contained a greater number and proportion of Proteobacteria, while bulk soil associated with _B. anthracis_ contained a greater number and proportion of Firmicutes. While the effect of plants on bulk soil is less well studied, plants are known to affect the composition and relative abundance of bacterial populations in the rhizosphere [59-63]. The observation that Proteobacteria comprise a greater number and proportion of bacteria in bulk soil associated with _E. desvauxii_ is expected given that Proteobacteria are dominant members of rhizosphere communities [59].

Despite the central role of the environment in its transmission, little is known about the survival and activity of _B. anthracis_ outside of a host, due in part to a lack of manipulative field experiments. Van Ness [64] proposed that under conditions of alkaline pH, high soil moisture, and the presence of organic matter, _B. anthracis_ maintains incubator areas where it multiplies in the environment but he failed to provide empirical support for his hypothesis. Field observations of carcass sites suggest that _B. anthracis_ might exhibit at least some limited level of activity in the environment, including the loss of one or both of virulence plasmids over time [65], [66], the acquisition of antibiotic resistance [67], and the maintenance of undiminished soil contamination levels for years despite exposure to the elements [17]. Moreover, several studies suggest that _B. anthracis_ may have the ability to interact with other members of the grassland-soil community [5-8,15,16]. Schuch and Fischetti [6] showed that bacteriophages provide _B. anthracis_ with alternatives to sporulation outside of the vertebrate host. The _B. anthracis_ isolate studied here was subsequently determined to contain a novel lysogenic bacteriophage that was recently characterized [68]. Future studies will explore the role that such phages may play in the interaction between _B. anthracis_ isolates and plants. In conclusion, the findings presented here suggest that _B. anthracis_ interacts with the grass, _E. desvauxii_ in the field, promoting its establishment, and providing a potential disease transmission route to grazing hosts.

This work takes our knowledge of what happens in soil during contamination from infected carcasses a leap forward. That _B. anthracis_ encourages forage growth at the site is a strong attractant to susceptible species to visit and revisit such sites, even though there is only a modest to no impact on long term spore survival and level of soil contamination. A definite Darwinian advantage for this pathogen. A paper well worth reading and thinking over. Patently the soil ecology of this bacterium has barely been scratched. Our thanks to Jennifer for bringing this interesting paper to our notice. - Mod.MHJ]
