Production of kagozi lebu, a kind of lime, fell 50 percent short of the [expected] target in Jhalakathi district this [2014] season thanks to unfavourable weather and onslaught of an "unknown" disease.

Most flowers dropped during [the] fruiting stage due to poor rainfall, and, at many places, fruit bearing plants died following attack of an unknown disease. The fruit was cultivated on 10 000 ha of the district this [2014] season.

Aziz Khalifa, Department of Agriculture Extension (DAE), said lime trees might have died by being infected with one kind of disease named "Dieback." However, he said the disease can be checked if branches of the trees are cut off and sprayed with insecticides when the trees show symptoms.

[Numerous undiagnosed diseases of citrus are being reported from the region. The term dieback is used for several different diseases of citrus, including greening (bacterial), tristeza (viral), nematode infections and multifactorial disease complexes, which may also include viroids, fungi and environmental factors. It is not clear which specific problem is reported here. While disease management for most citrus pathogens includes clean planting stock and elimination of pathogen reservoirs (as what may be aimed at by the treatments suggested above), conclusive diagnosis of the pathogen(s) involved is needed to design effective management strategies.

It is thought that combinations of various pathogens may have contributed to the general decline of citrus health in the region due to accumulation of parasitic pathogens in old orchards over time. Extensive harvest failures have led to citrus replanting programmes (ProMED-mail post 20080130.0375), but these will only be of long term benefit if linked to an ongoing crop sanitation and monitoring programme to prevent re-introduction of pathogens, especially into orchards used as sources for propagating material.
