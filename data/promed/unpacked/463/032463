Bird flu: 18 provinces affected
----------------------------
Livestock Department officials in 10 provinces have reduced chicken culling
compensation funds by over Bt30 million [over 731 000 USD] after farmers
failed to come forward to collect their claims.
So far, Livestock Department director general Yukol Laemthong said the
department had paid Bt1.5 billion [36 553 386 USD] in compensation to 295
900 farmers whose chickens had been culled.
But some farmers have not come forward to take their claims, and money set
aside for them has been returned to the government.
"The officials said the farmers had not come to get the money and they
could not contact them. They suspect some sort of mistake to do with repeat
claims," Yukol said.
He said the department had reported 3 more provinces affected by bird flu,
Chiang Mai, Nonthaburi and Pitsanulok, bringing the total number hit by the
second outbreak to 18. The number of chickens culled [during the current
outbreak] stands at 200 000, less then half of one percent of the 60
million chickens destroyed during the 1st outbreak.
"The comparatively small number of chickens killed shows that we have it
under control," he said.
Meanwhile the department is considering splitting into 2 to alleviate the
burden on livestock officials. With a total of 4700 staffers, the
department looks after 1.2 billion animals across the country. It is
considering splitting into a production division and a health division. A
feasibility study will take a year to complete.
In related news, a 14-year-old from Nong Khai has tested positive for
influenza A and is being treated as a suspected bird flu patient. Doctors
are waiting to complete tests to check whether he is infected with bird flu
and are monitoring developments and complications.

[The most recent follow-up report of Thailand to the OIE, dated 22 Jul
2004, named 17 provinces as recently infected. If the current news item
(adding Chiang Mai and Pitsanulok) is correct, then the total number is 19
and not 18, since the following Thai provinces are infected: Ayuthaya,
Bangkok, Chiang Mai, Chiang Rai, Lop Buri, Nakhon Nayok, Nakhon Sawan, Nan,
Narathiwat, Nontha Buri, Pathum Thani, Pitsanulok, Sara Buri, Songkhla,
Sukhothai, Suphan Buri, Trat, Uthai Thani and Uttaradit. - Mod.AS]

Bird flu outbreak spreads to 10 provinces in southern Viet Nam
--------------------------------------------------
Avian flu outbreaks have spread to 10 provinces in southern Viet Nam, local
media reported Saturday.
The People's Army newspaper quoted national veterinary officials as saying
the latest outbreaks were reported in Ben Tre and Kien Giang provinces in
the Mekong Delta on 21 Jul 2004.
To date, no provinces in northern Viet Nam have reported outbreaks, but
officials are worried about the dangers of bird flu recurring there, the
newspaper reported.
The devastating avian influenza, which made its way across Asia earlier in
the year, forced the slaughter of 100 million chickens and also infected
humans. A total of 24 people died, 16 of them in Viet Nam.
In the past month, small outbreaks have returned in Viet Nam, Thailand,
China and most recently Indonesia.
Viet Nam has already culled about 50 000 chickens as a precautionary
measure, all in the southern part of the country.
Hanoi, along with the country's 21 northern provinces, is stepping up
measures to prevent the bird flu's return. Beginning Sunday, city officials
will set up 16 animal checkpoints, and begin disinfecting all poultry
farms, markets, and slaughterhouses once a week over the next month.
