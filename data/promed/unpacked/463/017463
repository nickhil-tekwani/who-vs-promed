Europe should be vigilant against severe infections caused by a bacteria called group A _Streptococcus_ [GAS, or _Streptococcus pyogenes_] in children below 10 years, the World Health Organization (WHO) and European Centre for Disease Control & Prevention (ECDC) said on Monday [12 Dec 2022] [https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/increase-invasive-group-streptococcal-infections-among-children-europe-including].

European countries need to raise awareness about these infections, which have been on the rise this year particularly since September [2022], at a time of rising respiratory illnesses such as RSV [respiratory syncytial virus] and seasonal influenza, a joint statement from the agencies said.

The bacterium, which generally causes mild illness like sore throat, headache, and fever can also lead to a severe, life-threatening infection known as invasive group A streptococcal disease (iGAS).

Last week [5 Dec 2022], the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said it was looking at a possible spike in iGAS infections among children in the country.

Several deaths associated with iGAS disease in children aged under 10 have also been reported in some of the European countries during the period, according to the statement from WHO and ECDC [see the See Also section below].

[For a discussion of group A streptococcal (GAS) infections, please see my moderator comments in ProMED posts Streptococcus, group A - UK: (England) invasive, children, fatal 20221126.8706918 and Streptococcus group A, scarlet fever - UK: (England) seasonal increased cases 20220424.8702816.

Group A _Streptococcus_ (GAS) commonly causes pharyngitis, local suppurative extensions to involve the middle ear (otitis media) and sinuses (mastoiditis), and superficial skin infections, but can also cause invasive infections, including bacteremia, necrotizing fasciitis, toxic shock syndrome, endocarditis, puerperal sepsis, pneumonia, and meningitis. Serious non-suppurative sequelae, such as acute rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease, and glomerulonephritis may also occur after GAS pharyngitis.

GAS can be highly contagious; skin lesions, poor personal hygiene, and crowding in shelters for the homeless would be expected to facilitate its spread from person to person.

Some strains of GAS are more virulent than others. Tissue invasiveness of GAS has been attributed to several virulence factors, especially the cell wall M protein, encoded by the emm gene. Strains have been typed based on the antigenic specificity of its M protein. More recently GAS are typed on the basis of sequence analysis of the portion of the emm gene that encodes M serospecificity (https://www.cdc.gov/streplab/groupa-strep/emm-background.html). Over 200 emm types have been identified. Molecular analysis of the isolates emm aids in documenting a common source of an outbreak.

ProMED has posted several reports of outbreaks of invasive GAS infection (iGAS) in the past in the UK and in Canada among homeless people and people who inject drugs, due to particular emm types (see the See Also section below). There is a current outbreak in the UK of iGAS (see Streptococcus, group A - UK: (England) invasive, children, fatal 20221126.8706918; Streptococcus, group A - UK (03): scarlet fever, iGAS, fatal, RFI 20221209.8707158; and Streptococcus, group A - UK (02): (England) children, fatal, RFI 20221206.8707105), in Spain (see ProMED post Streptococcus, group A - Spain: (MD) invasive, children, fatal, RFI 20221210.8707189), and the USA (Streptococcus, group A - USA: (MN) invasive, children, elderly, RFI 20221212.8707237). Molecular emm typing would be important to document relatedness of the outbreaks in the USA, Spain, and the UK.

In the UK, in 2016, 84% of all emm1 strains isolated upper respiratory GAS isolates had a distinctive emm type 1 (designated M1UK) (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6838661/). The invasive GAS isolates collected in the same period in the UK were also M1UK (https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(19)30446-3/fulltext). M1UK was found to produce 9 times more streptococcal exotoxin than previous versions of emm type 1 isolates.

More information in this regard would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources as it becomes available. - Mod.ML]
