Hong Kong will add the mystery Wuhan pneumonia to the list of notifiable infectious diseases, giving authorities power to quarantine patients.

Medical practitioners will have to notify the government of anyone suspected to have been infected with the disease under changes expected to be in place this week

Hong Kong public hospitals admitted 6 more patients who had been to Wuhan in the past 14 days and presented with symptoms.

The Food and Health Bureau's announcement late on Monday [6 Jan 2020] night came as medical experts called on the government to step up health checks at the city's border and make visitors from Wuhan, which has been hit by a pneumonia outbreak, fill out a declaration form.

The bureau said amendments to the Prevention and Control of Disease Ordinance were "in full swing" to include "severe respiratory disease associated with a novel infectious agent" as a statutory notifiable infectious disease. It is expected to be published within this week.

Once published, medical practitioners who suspect a patient has the disease must notify the government. It is understood that the government would then have the power to order the patient be placed under quarantine. This cannot be done at present because the unidentified Wuhan pneumonia, which does not even have an official name yet, is not listed in the ordinance.

The bureau's move came as Hong Kong's public hospitals, in the 24 hours to noon on Monday [6 Jan 2020], admitted 6 more patients who had been to the city in Hubei province in the past 14 days and presented with fever, respiratory infection or pneumonia symptoms, though they have not been confirmed as cases of the disease. Aged 2 to 65, they were all in stable condition and had not visited wet markets in Wuhan. That brings the total number of cases in Hong Kong to 21, though 7 patients have already been discharged.

A seafood market in Wuhan is believed to be the source of the outbreak.

While there have been 59 cases in Wuhan, there are no confirmed cases outside the mainland city or any evidence to suggest human-to-human infection. Civic Party lawmaker Dr Kwok Ka-ki, a urologist, said local health officers should board trains from Wuhan -- a city of 11 million people about a 4-hour journey from Hong Kong -- at the West Kowloon high-speed rail terminal and check passengers' body temperatures before allowing them to enter the city. "Officers should spend 20 to 30 minutes to board trains, check body temperatures and ask passengers to fill out health declaration forms," he said. "It can't be voluntary; it won't work and is meaningless." The government has arranged thermal imaging systems at both the rail terminal and the airport to conduct mass checks of visitors' body temperature as they walk past. At the rail terminal, there is also a special voluntary lane where travellers from Wuhan can stop for checks using handheld infrared thermometers. But a recent Post check saw no one using the lane.

Kwok said that making it mandatory for Wuhan visitors to fill out a health declaration form with their contact details, which is not required currently, would allow the government to track them down better. A problem with using thermal imaging systems, rather than individual temperature checks, was that someone with fever could be missed if health officers were distracted for even a moment, Kwok added.

Dr Arisina Ma Chung-yee, president of the Hong Kong Public Doctors' Association, said the government had so far taken a passive approach at the border and agreed that a health declaration form was a must.

"I hope the Hong Kong government will be allowed to send people to Wuhan to gather more information about the disease. I hope the mainland can be as transparent as Hong Kong," she added. If the outbreak in Wuhan becomes serious, there are international standards to follow in banning Wuhan residents from visiting Hong Kong, Ma said.

There was a similar case involving a 20-year-old Chinese University student who 1st sought treatment at the private Union Hospital but decided to go elsewhere after she was told she should be quarantined at a public hospital. Experts said the 2 patients could not be placed in mandatory quarantine because of a legal loophole where the government could only place patients in mandatory quarantine if the Wuhan pneumonia was listed under the Prevention and Control of Disease Ordinance.

Professor David Hui Shu-cheong, a Chinese University respiratory medicine expert, said it was a problem that not much was known about the Wuhan pneumonia. What the government could do was require visitors from Wuhan to declare their health status and step up checks at the border, he added.

In a written reply, the Department of Health said that additional thermal imaging systems were in place at the airport and extra manpower assigned at the West Kowloon railway station to enhance temperature screening of travellers. The Food and Health Bureau said: "Inbound travellers with relevant symptoms and travel history identified will be immediately referred to public hospitals for isolation, treatment and follow-up." It had also advised the MTR Corporation, the Airport Authority and airlines to enhance cleaning and disinfection measures for trains and flights coming from Wuhan, it added.

Health authorities in Wuhan continue to work to identify viral pneumonia that has so far infected 59 people in the central Chinese city
---------------------------
Health experts warned the public on Monday [6 Jan 2020] not to drop their guard over the unidentified outbreak of viral pneumonia in central China, even though the health authorities have ruled out highly contagious viruses such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) or bird flu.

On Monday [6 Jan 2020] the local health authorities in Wuhan said that work to identify the virus, which has so far infected 59 people in the city, was continuing, but that SARS, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and certain types of flu had been ruled out.

Hong Kong health authorities said that the number of suspected cases in the city had reached 21, with 6 more being reported between Sunday [5 jan 2020] and noon on Monday [6 Jan 2020].

All those affected had visited the Hubei capital and developed pneumonia-related symptoms, including a 2-year-old boy and a female Chinese University student. The Centre for Health Protection said that the student was found to have common viruses unrelated to the Wuhan cases, including a type of coronavirus, while the other 5 new cases were found to have flu or other kinds of known viruses. 7 people have already been discharged from hospital.

So far, test results show that none of the cases reported outside mainland China - including 1 recent case in Singapore - were related to the Wuhan virus.

While the laboratory results have dispelled fears of a return of the deadly SARS epidemic in 2003 that killed hundreds in mainland China and Hong Kong, the unconfirmed source and unidentified strain of a possible new form of pneumonia has caused alarm among health experts.
Health experts warned the public on Monday [6 Jan 2020] not to drop their guard over the unidentified outbreak of viral pneumonia in central China, even though the health authorities have ruled out highly contagious viruses such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) or bird flu.

"There is limited information to determine the overall risk of this reported cluster of pneumonia of unknown [cause]," the World Health Organisation's China office said on Sunday [5 Jan 2020]. "The reported link to a wholesale fish and live animal market could indicate a link to exposure to animals." The WHO added that it would continue to monitor the situation closely.

The 1st cases of the mysterious virus were reported last week and many of those affected worked at Wuhan's Huanan seafood market, which has since been closed. However, the number of those in a "severe condition" has now fallen from 11 to seven.

A total of 163 people who had been in close contact with the infected patients have been placed under medical observation. No deaths have been reported.

"Preliminary investigations have not shown evidence of human-to-human transmission of the virus. But the work to identify the virus is still ongoing, as we are still uncertain of the source and cause of the virus," said Li Gang, director of the Wuhan Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, told the local newspaper Changjiang Ribao .

Professor David Hui Shu-cheong, a specialist in respiratory medicine at Chinese University of Hong Kong, said that based on the available information available, the virus was likely to be a type of coronavirus. This virus family includes the common cold and SARS, and the virus is likely to be contagious among human, he said.

"It is common that these new types of coronavirus are contagious from person to person. The difference is whether or not it is highly contagious," Hui said, adding that the virus was clearly a new strain of pneumonia, since all typical diagnostic tests that have been carried out have been negative. Hui said one common method to find out whether a virus was contagious among humans was to determine whether relatives of those infected had fallen ill despite not visiting the market at the centre of the outbreak themselves. Another indication would be whether the medical personnel who have been in contact with patients have been infected.

If so, tests would then be performed to see whether the virus genomes show an exact match, which would in turn reveal whether the virus is contagious. However, Hui said it was a positive sign that the number of severe cases had fallen to seven. "This at least shows that some people are able to recover from it," he said

Ho Pak-leung, a microbiologist at the University of Hong Kong, urged the mainland Chinese authorities to release more information - including the age, gender, suspected infected area and condition - of the patients in Wuhan. "There is now more information from the mainland that shows that the virus could have 1st been transmitted from animals to humans," Ho said.

"Although now the virus [has been confirmed not to be] SARS and MERS, [coronavirus] carried in animals has been identified as a common cause of pneumonia in humans in recent years," Ho told Commercial Radio, noting that most cases identified have been linked to the wet market in Wuhan.

Ho added that in the previous SARS and MERS epidemics, around 20 per cent of those infected had passed the virus on to other humans.

SARS claimed the lives of 299 people in Hong Kong and 349 in mainland China in 2002 and 2003. Scientists later concluded that the virus originated from bats, and later passed through civets before reaching humans.

[As of the time of preparation of this post (evening EST on 6 Jan 2020), there have been no new updates released by the Wuhan Public Health Committee since the last ProMED-mail post on 5 Jan 2019.

The information from Hong Kong is very interesting; of the 21 cases with fever and respiratory illness with history of travel to or from Wuhan in the past 14 days, 16 had confirmed respiratory viral illnesses, including: influenza A H3 (6) influenza A H1 (2), Human Rhinovirus/Enterovirus (3), Respiratory syncytial virus (3) (1 with Coronavirus 229E coinfection), parainfluenza type 1 (1), human metapneumovirus (1), and adenovirus, coinfection with coronavirus OC43, an expected mixture of respiratory viruses seen this time of year. Five of these cases are still pending results, ages in their 20s, 30s or 40s. Interesting...

An important statement contained in the media report [3]: "So far, test results show that none of the cases reported outside mainland China - including one recent case in Singapore - were related to the Wuhan virus." So far the event doesn't seem to be travelling. In addition, the speculation that this may be a new coronavirus is a reasonable speculation, albeit it is a speculation. Once again I end my comment with "We await further information from knowledgeable sources as the information becomes available."
