Zimbabwean health officials have reportedly said that at least 200 cases of typhoid have been recorded in Harare, adding that the country is on high alert following a cholera outbreak in Zambia. According to Daily News, the health and child care ministry said that they were no deaths recorded yet but more case were expected to emerge. "The suspected cases were reported from infectious Diseases Hospital recording 87, Southern District 58, West South West District 11 and Western District 37, all in Harare Province and 7 at Harare Hospital," the ministry was quoted as saying.

A water crisis in the capital was one of the main causes of the infectious diseases, as people resorted to unsafe water sources, the report said. The deadly but curable outbreak saw the Harare City Council in 2017 issuing a 48-hour ultimatum to food vendors operating in the city centre to 'cease operation' due to a typhoid outbreak. Health authorities claimed at the time that there had been more than 2300 suspected cases of typhoid nationally, and 12 deaths.

[Typhoid fever, so-called enteric fever caused by _Salmonella enterica_ serotype Typhi, has a totally different presentation from that of the more common kinds of salmonellosis. Epidemiologically, usually spread by contaminated food or water, typhoid is not a zoonosis like the more commonly seen types of salmonellosis. Clinically, vomiting and diarrhea are typically absent; indeed, constipation is frequently reported. As it is a systemic illness, blood cultures are at least as likely to be positive as stool in enteric fever, particularly early in the course of the infection, and bone marrow cultures may be the most sensitive.

The symptoms of classical typhoid fever typically include fever, anorexia, lethargy, malaise, dull continuous headache, non-productive cough, vague abdominal pain, and constipation. Despite the often high fever, the pulse is often only slightly elevated. During the 2nd week of the illness, there is protracted fever and mental dullness, classically called coma vigil. Diarrhea may develop but usually does not. Many patients develop hepatosplenomegaly [both liver and spleen enlarged]. After the 1st week or so, many cases develop a maculopapular rash on the upper abdomen. These lesions ("rose spots") are about 2 cm (0.8 in) in diameter and blanch on pressure. They persist for 2-4 days and may come and go. Mild and atypical infections are common.

The word typhoid (as in typhus-like) reflects the similarity of the louse-borne rickettsial disease epidemic typhus and that of typhoid fever; in fact, in some areas, typhoid fever is still referred to as abdominal typhus.
