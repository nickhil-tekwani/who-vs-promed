Residents in SA [South Australia] areas populated by water birds and
mosquitoes are at risk from a deadly tropical disease. Areas along the
River Murray and Riverland region are understood to be the areas most
at risk of Murray Valley encephalitis [MVE] [virus] infection, a
disease [virus] passed to humans from mosquitoes.

A 47-year-old man from regional SA has been admitted to hospital with
MVE [virus infection] -- the state's 1st case in more than 35 years.
Authorities have also been notified of a 27-year-old man in a more
serious condition suspected of having the virus. Both men are
understood to be from the Riverland region.

MVE can cause confusion, headaches, drowsiness, neck stiffness,
tremors, and seizures -- but in more serious cases can be fatal or
lead to permanent brain damage.

SA Health believes the virus was passed on after mosquitoes bit water
birds, such as pelicans, carrying the virus to the state from tropical
areas. SA Health chief medical officer Professor Paddy Phillips said
Adelaide and suburban areas were potentially at risk of infection, but
said authorities were most concerned about regional areas along the
Murray and the Riverland where large numbers of water birds and
mosquitoes were located.

"It is important for the public to realise that the best protection
is not getting bitten by mosquitoes," he said. "Because the virus is
carried by water birds, which are mobile, we have to assume MVE
[virus] is potentially present wherever these birds and mosquitoes
are." He said people needed to cover up with long, loose-fitted
clothing, wear good-quality insect repellent, keep clear of mosquitoes
where possible, reduce areas around their home where mosquitoes could
breed and to use netting and screens.

The reported infection comes after a northwest Victorian man died of
a suspected case of MVE [virus infection] earlier this month [March
2011; see ProMED-mail archive number 20110316.0841]. Australian
Medical Association SA president Dr Andrew Lavender said it was likely
there would be a number of further cases of people being infected with
MVE in regional SA. "Infections are most likely to be in areas
surrounding wetlands and large bodies of water such as Lake
Alexandrina," he said.

He said only one in about 1000 infections were likely to become a
severe encephalitis affecting the brain.

[The occurrence of this confirmed human MVE virus infection case
occurred at the same time that the virus was detected in birds in this
area of South Australia (see ProMED-mail archive number
20110330.0989). The recent unusually heavy rains and flooding in the
state have created breeding sites for mosquito vectors. One hopes that
people residing in these areas of South Australia will heed advice of
health authorities to avoid mosquito bites, as that is the only
preventive measure available.
