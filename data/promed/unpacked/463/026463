The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health is today [19 Sep 2014] investigating a case of necrotizing fasciitis (NF) affecting a man aged 56. The patient, with good past health, has presented with fever, left leg pain and swelling since 15 Sep 2014 and was admitted to Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital (PYNEH) on 17 Sep 2014. He is currently in the Intensive Care Unit in critical condition. The clinical diagnosis was left leg NF, with amputation performed on 17 Sep 2014. His blood culture yielded _Vibrio vulnificus_ upon laboratory testing by PYNEH. _V. vulnificus_ is a type of bacterium which can cause NF. The patient has no recent travel history. His home contacts were asymptomatic. Investigations by the CHP are proceeding.

Last week, the CHP reported 2 other _V. vulnificus_ necrotizing fasciitis cases in women over 70 years of age.

According to the Florida Department of Health, People can get infected with _V. vulnificus_ when they eat raw shellfish, particularly oysters. The bacterium is frequently isolated from oysters and other shellfish in warm coastal waters during the summer months. Since it is naturally found in warm marine waters, people with open wounds can be exposed to _V. vulnificus_ through direct contact with seawater. There is no evidence of person-to-person transmission.

Healthy individuals typically develop a mild disease; however _V. vulnificus_ infections can be a serious concern for people who have weakened immune systems, particularly those with chronic liver disease. The bacterium can invade the bloodstream, causing a severe and life-threatening illness with symptoms like fever, chills, decreased blood pressure (septic shock) and blistering skin lesions. _V. vulnificus_ bloodstream infections are fatal about 50 percent of the time.

[The posting states that the man was in previously good health, and no information was given about the older women with invasive _V. vulnificus_ infection.

The following is excerpted from the "Bad Bug Book," Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, US FDA (Food & Drug Administration) at http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~mow/chap10.html:

_Vibrio vulnificus_, a lactose-fermenting, halophilic, Gram-negative, opportunistic pathogen, is found in estuarine environments and associated with various marine species such as plankton, shellfish (oysters, clams, and crabs), and finfish. Environmental factors responsible for controlling numbers of _V. vulnificus_ in seafood and in the environment include temperature, pH, salinity, and amounts of dissolved organics. It may be normal flora in salt water, and acquiring this organism from shellfish or water exposure does not imply that the water is contaminated by sewage.

Wound infections result either from contaminating an open wound with sea water harboring the organism, or by lacerating part of the body on coral, fish, etc., followed by contamination with the organism.

The ingestion of _V. vulnificus_ by healthy individuals can result in gastroenteritis. The "primary septicemia" form of the disease follows consumption of raw seafood containing the organism by individuals with underlying chronic disease, particularly liver disease. The organism can also enter through damaged skin. In these individuals, the microorganism enters the blood stream, resulting in septic shock, rapidly followed by death in many cases (about 50 percent). Over 70 percent of infected individuals have distinctive bulbous skin lesions (shown at http://safeoysters.org/medical/diagnosis.html). - Mod.LL
