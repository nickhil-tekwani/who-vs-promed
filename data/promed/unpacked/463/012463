Summary
-------
In recent weeks, the decline in case incidence and the contraction of the geographic area affected by Ebola virus disease (EVD) transmission that was apparent throughout April and early May [2015] has stalled. In total, 31 confirmed cases of EVD were reported in the week ending 7 Jun [2015]: 16 cases in Guinea and 15 in Sierra Leone. This is the 2nd consecutive weekly increase in case incidence, and the highest weekly total number of cases reported from Sierra Leone since late March [2015]. In addition, cases were reported from a widening geographical area in Guinea and Sierra Leone, and the continued occurrence of cases that arise from unknown sources of infection highlights the challenges still faced in finding and eliminating every chain of transmission.

A total of 16 cases were reported from 5 western prefectures of Guinea in the week to 7 Jun [2015]. Half of all cases were reported from the south western prefecture of Forecariah, which borders Sierra Leone. In the north west of the country, on the border with Guinea-Bissau, a case was reported from the prefecture of Boke for the 4th consecutive week. The capital, Conakry, reported 2 cases, as did the neighbouring coastal prefecture of Dubreka, with the remaining 3 cases reported from the inland prefecture of Kindia, which borders the Sierra Leonean district of Bombali. Conakry and Kindia had previously not reported a case for over 40 days.

A total of 5 of the 16 cases reported from Guinea arose from unknown sources of infection, including all 3 cases reported from Kindia. Investigations are ongoing to trace the origin of those cases. In addition, 3 cases in Guinea, including 1 of those from Kindia, were identified after post-mortem testing of community deaths. As at 7 Jun [2015], there were 1693 contacts being monitored across 8 prefectures in Guinea.

Sierra Leone reported a total of 15 confirmed cases from 2 districts in the week to 7 Jun [2015]. Similar to the previous week, most cases (7) were reported from quarantined homes in a small area of Kaffu Bullom chiefdom in the district of Port Loko. However, a cluster of 3 cases was also reported from the Bureh Kasseh Ma chiefdom of the same district. The cases are not thought to be directly linked to Kaffu Bullom, but rather to a chain of transmission in the neighbouring district of Kambia. After reporting its 1st case in more than 2 weeks the previous week, 5 cases were reported from 2 chiefdoms in Kambia during the week ending 7 June [2015].

The Western Urban Area of Sierra Leone, which includes the capital Freetown, reported no cases for the 1st time since August 2014. However, there were still 195 contacts under follow-up in the district as at 7 Jun [2015], and a total of 392 contacts nationally in 3 districts (Kambia and Port Loko are the other 2 districts).

Efforts are ongoing to augment the ability of contact tracing and case-investigation teams to engage effectively with affected communities in Guinea and Sierra Leone. In Guinea, 19 unsafe burials were reported during the week to 7 Jun [2015]. Although no unsafe burials have been reported for many weeks in Sierra Leone, investigations into recent cases in Kambia have found clear evidence that they are still taking place in some areas. Improved communication with local communities is essential to understand and address any concerns that prevent cases and deaths from being reported, and chains of transmission from being detected.

All contacts associated with the case confirmed in Italy on 12 May [2015] have now completed the 21-day follow-up period.

The last health worker infections in Guinea and Sierra Leone were reported on 6 Apr [2015] and 14 May [2015], respectively. There have been a total of 869 confirmed health worker infections reported from Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone since the start of the outbreak, with 507 reported deaths.

Countries with widespread and intense transmission
--------------------------------------------------
There have been a total of 27 237 reported confirmed, probable, and suspected cases of EVD in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone (figure 1, table 1), with 11 158 reported deaths (this total includes reported deaths among probable and suspected cases, although outcomes for many cases are unknown). A total of 16 new confirmed cases were reported in Guinea and 15 in Sierra Leone in the 7 days to 7 Jun [2015]. The outbreak in Liberia was declared over on 9 May [2015].

The total number of confirmed cases is similar in males and females (table 2). Compared with children (people aged 14 years and under), people aged 15 to 44 are approximately 3 to 4 times more likely to be affected. People aged 45 and over are 4 to 5 times more likely to be affected than children.

A total of 869 confirmed health worker infections have been reported in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone; there have been 507 reported deaths (table 5). ... -- more

[in French, machine trans. CW, edited]
[The United Nations Agency for Emergency Action against Ebola will exit Guinea in July 2015.
According to official information, a new confirmed case notified originated from Bolodou Kindia, a town in the prefecture of south-eastern Guinea. As of 7 Jun 2015, there are 2 new confirmed Ebola cases.]

9 Jun 2015 Italy: Ebola-infected nurse healed
http://www.ansa.it/english/news/general_news/2015/06/09/ebola-infected-nurse-healed_bd102445-0032-424f-9bee-29a172d3b431.html [The Italian nurse, while working for the Emergency aid group in Sierra Leone, was infected with the Ebola virus and diagnosed shortly after he returned home to Sardinia. He tested positive for Ebola on 12 May 2015 while admitted at another hospital, he was transferred to the Spallanzani National Institute for Infectious Diseases, a facility which had previously treated another Italian health-care worker for Ebola, acquired while working in West Africa.]

8 Jun 2015 Liberia: Ebola workers plan strike
http://www.thenewdawnliberia.com/news/7580-ebola-workers-plan-strike
[According to the media source, ("MD"), a spokesperson for the group of workers, 102 aggrieved workers of the Ebola Treatment Unit in Bopolu (Gbarpolu County) will be involved in a labor strike if the Ministry of Labor fails to investigate into the deduction of between USD 84 and USD 100 from their monthly wages by the management of Boyasay Inc., subcontracted by the Pacific Architecture Engineering (PAE). The withdrawals are said to be for housing, transportation, and hazard benefits.]

[The Liberian workers also were reported to have been protesting, demanding hazard benefits. See item [3] in Ebola update (75): WHO, Liberia, Sierra Leone, susp 20150603.3407945. It is disturbing that the workers who served the country so well and were instrumental in terminating the Ebola outbreak, are having to fight to get paid what they are owed. - Mod.LK]

10 Jun 2015 Guinea, Sierra Leone: Ebola spikes again in Guinea, Sierra Leone: WHO
http://medicalxpress.com/news/2015-06-ebola-spikes-guinea-sierra-leone.html
[Week ending 7 Jun 2015: 16 new cases in Guinea, 15 new cases in Sierra Leone.
Week ending 31 May 2015: 13 new cases in Guinea, 12 new cases in Sierra Leone.
Week ending 24 May 2015: 9 new cases in Guinea, 3 new cases in Sierra Leone.
This is the 2nd consecutive week of increased Ebola case numbers for the 2 countries.
The number of health-care workers who have died in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone is now 507.
WHO expressed concern regarding the number of areas affected in Guinea.
2 of the new Guinea cases are in the capital of Guinea, Conakry. Ebola virus also reappeared with 3 new cases in the western Guinean region of Kindia]

10 Jun 2015: Think tank sues FDA for compassionate use documents for an Ebola drug
http://blogs.wsj.com/pharmalot/2015/06/10/think-tank-sues-fda-for-compassionate-use-documents-for-an-ebola-drug/
[A libertarian think tank, the Goldwater Institute, supported by the Koch Brothers, has filed suit against the FDA over the Federal Drug Administration's compassionate-use program, and is an attempt to compel the FDA to turn over records relating to the program. This program allows patients with serious diseases to access a medicine in development, even if not yet enrolled in a clinical trial. The Goldwater Institute has focused on ZMAPP to find out how the FDA processes requests, and has tried to obtain FDA records about the ZMAPP decision.
The Goldwater Institute filed Freedom of Information Act requests last year [2014] in an attempt to gain access to FDA records. The FDA turned down the requests because of "trade secrets and confidential commercial information."
According to the FDA, last year [2014], the think tank filed Freedom of Information Act requests to obtain FDA records, but the agency denied the requests, citing "trade secrets and confidential commercial information," according to the responses sent by the agency]

8 Jun 2015: Liberia: Ebola - Joint-border surveillance program welcoming, but.....
http://allafrica.com/stories/201506082511.html?viewall=1
[Because of the shared porous borders of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, a regional program is being developed by the 3 countries in which the countries will, in some fashion, combine efforts in post-Ebola recovery efforts, especially for sharing experiences, and a joint border surveillance facility.]

8 Jun 2015: Sierra Leone, Guinea intensify cross-border collaboration to end Ebola
http://allafrica.com/stories/201506081352.html
[In the 2nd of recurring meetings, President Conde (Guinea) and President Koromo (Sierra Leone) reaffirmed their commitment to continue cross-border surveillance and collaboration, and to encourage community ownership of the attempts to bring the Ebola count to 0. The new infections have been located primarily in Susu-dominated communities in the Forecariah Prefecture in Guinea and the Kambia District in Sierra Leone. Both locations are at the official border crossing into both countries.]

[IDS Director Melissa Leach welcomed Cameron's message urging better global preparedness for the next potential pandemic, but urged the UK government to learn from the current Ebola epidemic.]

Vaccines and research
---------------------
8 Jun 2015 Ghana: NDC says no to "needless" Ebola vaccines trial in V/R
http://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/artikel.php?ID=361405&channel=A3
[The ruling National Democratic Congress (NDC), in the Volta region, is warning it will resist any attempt by the government to use Voltarians as "guinea pigs in a needless" Ebola vaccines trial. The University of Health and Allied Sciences (Ghana, at Hohoe, in the Volta region) is spearheading an Ebola vaccines trial which is expected to kick off soon, also at Hohoe in the Volta region.]

[Also see 10 Jun 2015: Ghana: Speaker orders cessation of Ebola trials in Ghana
http://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/artikel.php?ID=361867&channel=A3
[The decision by Ghana's Minister of Health, Hon. Alex Segbefia, to allow Ebola clinical trials to start without notifying the members of Parliament has resulted in the angry members demanding the trials be stopped and the minister brought before Parliament to explain his unilateral decision.]

And 10 Jun 2015: Ghana halts Ebola vaccine trial due to community protests
http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/06/10/health-ebola-ghana-idUSL5N0YW45820150610?rpc=401
[Ghana halts plan indefinitely to test 2 Ebola vaccines after legislators backed local protests against the trials sparked by fears of contamination. The country's Food and Drugs Authority said it had begun enlisting volunteers in Hohoe in the Volta region to be injected with drugs made by Johnson & Johnson and Bavarian Nordic as part of a global Ebola vaccine drive.
Youth leaders threatened to boycott the programme. "We don't want to be guinea pigs," one local leader told Reuters.]

[Community education would go a long way towards alleviating fears. - Mod.LK]

[This shows a sad lack of concern for neighbouring West African countries. It will be left to British, Australian, and East African "guinea pigs" to test a vaccine that will protect West Africans, just as Brazilians proved the safety of the 17D yellow fever vaccine (based on a live, attenuated viral strain), which along with a French vaccine was used to protect Africans. In 1937 the Rockefeller Foundation vaccinated 59,000 Brazilians with the 17D yellow fever vaccine without severe complications. - Mod.JW]

9 Jun 2015: Last year's [2014] Ebola strain weaker than that of 1976: study
http://www.ndtv.com/world-news/last-years-ebola-strain-weaker-than-that-of-1976-study-770232
[The results of the test on monkeys by scientists at the National Institutes of Health indicate the Ebola strain that ravaged West Africa last year (2014, Makona strain) is less virulent than the 1st recognized Ebola strain that appeared in 1976 (Mayinga strain). In addition, the immune systems of the animals with the weaker Makona strain produced around 3 times as much virus-fighting protein as did those with the Mayinga strain.
The results of the test on monkeys by scientists at the National Institutes of Health are considered important because they suggest the virus that caused at least 11 000 deaths is not becoming more severe.
"In fact, the new study suggests the current virus has a decreased ability to cause disease in their animal model compared to the 1976 strain," the study indicates]

[At issue is the amount of funds spent per patient in their one Ebola treatment facility in Sierra Leone, compared to the amount spent per patient at Medecins Sans Frontieres' 3 facilities in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. Australia spent approximately 8-times more per patient than did MSF.]
Aspen Medical Group, which was issued a USD 20 million contract in 2014 to manage and run one field hospital in Sierra Leone, treated over 200 patients at a total cost of USD 18.2 million.
Out of the 216 patients treated, 156 patients were discharged (120 of whom did not have Ebola, and 36 were treated for Ebola and discharged. There were 60 deaths, not all of which were from Ebola. The average cost of treatment per patient by Aspen Medical at their single facility was greater than USD 84 600.
Comparison was made with Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF), which spent a total of USD 82 million on its Ebola response: 7600 admissions to 3 facilities in Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia. Of these, 4755 who received treatment from MSF were confirmed Ebola cases, and of those cases nearly 2200 patients recovered. The average spent in MSF's 3 facilities, per patient, was USD 10 730.]
