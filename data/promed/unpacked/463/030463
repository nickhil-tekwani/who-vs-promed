Hepatitis B outbreak: government yet to produce report
------------------------------------------------------
The outbreak of hepatitis B, which claimed the lives of 92 people, is
believed to be Gujarat's worst epidemic since the plague, which hit Surat
in 1994.

Most of the deaths in Modasa happened in the age group of 15 to 45 years.
While during the Surat plague, 2 investigation committees -- one by state
and another by Centre [government] -- were formed when 52 people died of
the disease. The state government has yet to make public the cause and
spread of the disease and also investigate whether few doctors' medical
malpractices led to the outbreak.

A paper by deputy director (epidemic) in the state health department claims
that the hepatitis B virus detected in Modasa was noticed in the 2001 focal
outbreak of hepatitis B in Mehsana. Further details on the virus have been
wilfully avoided. This, the officer claims, is a certain ayw subtype, which
became lethal this year [2009].

However, the virus this time claimed lives in 3 talukas Modasa, Idar, and
Meghraj in Sabarkantha district, which is believed to be the epicentre of
the outbreak. A total of 495 persons were admitted to government public
health centres in the 3 talukas and Ahmedabad Civil Hospital for treatment.

Till now, the disease has shown presence in Himmatnagar, Bayad, Bhiloda,
Prantij, Balasinor, Vijaynagar, and Khedbrahma. "Like the Surat plague, the
state government should bring out a white paper on hepatitis B in the
state. It is one of the worst epidemics to have struck Gujarat and people
have the right to know," says IIM-A [Indian Institute of
Management-Ahmedabad] professor Dileep Mavlankar.

[This press report seems to indicate that the cause of the serious outbreak
of hepatitis B virus infection in Gujarat state earlier in the year (2009),
at the time attributed to medical malpractice, remains unresolved. Further
information from any informed source would be welcomed.
