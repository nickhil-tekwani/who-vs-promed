Many years ago I worked on a project with Dr. Helmut Kleeberg in which he was
using isoniazid to treat cattle for tuberculosis; thousands of cattle were
under treatment. We did not use tablets but purchased the pure powder in
large drums at a remarkably low price. Dairy cattle were all being fed a
daily ration of dairy meal concentrate and all that was necessary was to
measure out the dose of powdered isoniazid with a spoon onto the top of the
heap of dairy meal. The cattle ate all the meal and the isoniazid. Blood
assays confirmed that they were receiving the correct dose. Elephants might
similarly eat isoniazid mixed into a concentrate meal ration. It should be
possible for a feed company to incorporate the isoniazid into any milled feed
such as lucerne meal and to pellet the product for you. Of course this would
only be practical if the isolate of _M. tuberculosis_ is isoniazid sensitive.
