China, which has reported some 30 outbreaks of the deadly strain of bird
flu in 2005, said on Wednesday that the country could see more of the
disease as transport of live poultry increases over the Lunar New Year
holidays.
Jia Youling, director-general of the Agriculture Ministry's veterinary
bureau, said no new cases of the H5N1 virus have been reported for 15 days
after a rash of outbreaks in the past 2 months, but he cautioned against
complacency. "There is still the possibility for sporadic outbreaks in
winter this year or spring next year and we are still facing great
challenges in bird flu control," Jia told a news conference.
China has been scrambling to curb outbreaks with mass vaccinations of its
14 billion poultry and with an education campaign to encourage farmers and
local officials to report new cases.We predict that during the New Year
there will be greater consumption of domestic birds and more frequent
long-haul transportation, so there might be a possibility that there will
be fresh outbreaks as a result of this," Jia said. Chinese New Year falls
at the end of January. China was trying to guard against that with
stepped-up vaccination efforts, more frequent inspections, curbing the
slaughter of live chickens in markets, he said.
But on Wednesday, the eastern province of Anhui -- which has reported 2
human cases of bird flu in 2005 -- lifted a ban on the slaughtering of live
poultry in all markets, claiming that the H5N1 strain of the disease had
been brought under control, the official Xinhua News Agency said. Live
poultry dealers were encouraged to resume operations, according to the
province's headquarters for bird flu prevention, Xinhua reported after Jia
had spoken.
However, local officials would tighten supervision and quarantine
procedures over live poultry markets after the lifting of the ban, the news
agency added without elaborating. Beijing has pledged openness in fighting
bird flu after it was widely criticised for its cover-up of the SARS virus
in 2003, but Health Minister Gao Qiang has said rural doctors might be
ill-equipped or ill-trained to detect cases.
Jia reiterated the government's stance that it has not covered up any bird
flu outbreaks, and said in fact it was facing the opposite problem --
farmers were falsely reporting the virus in hopes of receiving
compensation. "As every farmer and local official must know, they cannot
hide any outbreaks for long because if they hide outbreaks it will
eventually spread to other regions and there will be an even bigger impact
on the local economy," Jia said.
China has also confirmed 5 human infections from bird flu, but it was still
facing a mystery over the source of infection in 2 of those cases, which
occurred in places where no poultry outbreaks had been reported. The World
Health Organisation has said that could mean the disease in birds was going
undetected, but Jia said samples of birds taken in both the cases -- in the
eastern province of Anhui and the southern province of Guangxi -- tested
negative for the virus.
The infected people in those cases may have contracted the disease through
droppings of wild birds or through water contaminated by infected wild
birds, Jia said.
Xinhua reported on Wednesday that the State Forestry Administration has
established an arm to monitor bird flu among migratory and wild birds.
"Most bird flu-hit areas have wetlands nearby and the epidemic often breaks
out sometime after the arrivals of migratory birds," Xinhua quoted Zhao
Liangping, head of the monitoring station, as saying.

Taiwan has discovered low-pathogenic H7N3 and H5N2 strains of the avian flu
in migratory bird droppings on the outskirts of the capital Taipei, the
agriculture department said on Wednesday. Like the deadly H5N1 strain of
bird flu, which has killed more than 70 people around Asia, the H7N3 strain
can infect humans. But the H5N2 strain, which can be lethal for birds, is
not dangerous to humans.
In regular monitoring of migratory birds, the viruses were detected in
marshlands on the outskirts of the capital, the Council of Agriculture said
in a statement. There are no poultry farms within a radius of 3 km (1.8
miles) of the droppings, so the council said there was no risk of broader
infection, although it still urged nearby residents to be vigilant.
The council said many migratory birds fly to Taiwan on their southward
journey during the cold winter months. This is the 3rd time Taiwan has
discovered the H7N3 strain in 2005, after detecting the virus in November
and previously in April.
An outbreak of the less virulent H5N2 strain of bird flu in Taiwan in 2004
led to the culling of hundreds of thousands of fowl. Taiwan has not
experienced a major outbreak of H5N1. In October, the island found only its
2nd case of the deadly strain since 2003, in birds smuggled in a container
ship from China.
The H7N3 strain, which can potentially be transmitted to humans, was first
detected in turkeys in Britain in 1963 and made one of its last known
appearances in poultry in Canada in April and May 2004, according to the
World Health Organisation and World Organisation for Animal Health.
