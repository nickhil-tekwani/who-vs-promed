The EU Veterinary Committee is expected to lift on Monday [3 Dec
2007] the prohibition of pork meat exports from Cyprus and of the
consumption of meat from the 3 km protection zone and the 10 km
surveillance zone around the infected holding where foot and mouth
disease (FMD) was detected.

Cyprus Agriculture, Natural Resources and Environment Minister Photis
Photiou met with EU Commissioner for Health Marcos Kyprianou to
review the whole situation as regards FMD, with a view to look into
the measures that must be lifted the soonest, as Photiou said.

We have asked that the prohibition of pork meat exports be lifted,
Photiou said, adding that the Commissioner was positive as regards
this issue, and the EU Veterinary Commission will lift this measure
on its meeting on Monday [3 Nov 2007].

Three new suspected cases of FMD have been reported at farms in
Paphos and Nicosia.

According to head of the veterinary services Charalambos Kakoyiannis,
there is no real reason for concern.

Kakoyiannis also said that no measures have been taken at the farms
where the suspected cases are located.

A total of 19 000 specimens have been taken in the past few days in
order to determine the extent of the disease on the island.

The EU is expected to lift the prohibition of pork meat exports from
Cyprus next week.

The ban on consumption of meat from the 3-km protection zone and the
10-km surveillance zone around the farm where FMD was detected is
also expected to be lifted.

Last week, a panel of EU exerts confirmed that the FMD virus did
exist in Cyprus but was inactive.

[From the above 2 articles, one from a newspaper (Financial Mirror)
in the Republic of Cyprus and the other one from the Turkish Republic
of Northern Cyprus, the following becomes apparent:

1. Three new "cases" of FMD have been discovered in flocks which are
significantly distant from the initial "outbreak" in the Larnaca
region, namely in Paphos and Nicosia (see map at
<http://content.answers.com/main/content/img/BritannicaConcise/images/69811.gif>).

2. The Chief Veterinary Officer regards these findings as "no real
reason for concern" and stated that "no measures have been taken at
the (said) farms."

3. The EU Veterinary Committee is expected to lift early next week
most if not all restrictions on exports of animal products; the
restrictions on exports of live animals seem to be retained.

From what was said, it may be deduced that no active FMD infection is
currently suspected to be present within the Republic of Cyprus. As
suggested in previous ProMED-mail postings, the non-event may just
reflect past, unauthorised vaccinations in sheep. These vaccinations
may have taken place on the Island or elsewhere; vaccinated,
seropositive sheep may have found their way to various parts of the
island.

It will be interesting to obtain confirmation or otherwise on the
above assumption as well as the results of epidemiological
investigations.

A final report to the OIE with the said results may pave the way for
reinstating Cyprus' freedom of FMD infection. - Mod.AS]
