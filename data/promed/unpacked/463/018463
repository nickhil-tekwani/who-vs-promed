We report on the 2nd laboratory-confirmed case of _Anaplasma phagocytophilum_ acquired within the province of Alberta, Canada; the 1st confirmed case detected 9 years ago, was reported by Parkins et al (1).

The patient, an adult female, lives on a rural property close to a Provincial Park in the Edmonton Health zone. On [1 May 2017] (day 0), after spending time outdoors gardening and cleaning her dog's kennel, a tick check revealed an un-engorged tick attached on her left anterior upper arm, surrounded by a circular area of redness approximately 2 cm in diameter that was neither painful nor pruritic.

Upon failing to remove the entire tick at home, she went to the local emergency department (ED) to have the tick remnants and mouthparts surgically removed, and was discharged after receiving a tetanus vaccine booster but was not prescribed antibiotics.

By day 2 the area of redness had resolved, but by day 6 the patient developed progressive fatigue, night sweats, and myalgia; ibuprofen provided some relief for the myalgia. Episodes of alternating stabbing temporal headaches ensued for the next 4 days motivating her to return to the ED on day 13. She was febrile (38 deg C [100.4 deg F]) and thrombocytopaenic [89 x10^9/L, (normal range 140 to 450x10^9/L)] at presentation, but was later discharged, with a provisional diagnosis of fever of unknown origin. She was told to follow-up with her family physician after a couple of days for another complete blood count.

However, the on-going severity of her symptoms, notably drenching night sweats, prompted her to return to her family physician on day 16, and she was referred to the ED. A repeat CBC showed a mild anaemia, elevated white blood cells [13.2x10^9/L (normal range 4 to 11x10^9/L)] with neutrophilia [11.5x10^9/L (normal range 1.8-7.5x10^9/L)], and lymphopaenia [0.9x10^9/L (normal range 1.0 to 4.5x10^9/L)]. As an ECG demonstrated new onset atrial fibrillation, she was admitted for cardiac support.

Based upon the history of tick exposure, Lyme disease and Rocky Mountain fever were suspected. She was started empirically on doxycycline and baseline serologies for these 2 agents were also collected. Her night sweats abated within 2 days of starting doxycycline, and over the next 2 months she was incrementally able to return to her daily routine without experiencing periods of tiredness and arrhythmia.

The key diagnostic results that determined _Anaplasma phagocytophilum_ to be the etiologic agent were as follows. The tick remnants were identified as a female _Ixodes scapularis_, known to be the primary tick vector for this organism, and the specimen tested positive for _A. phagocytophilum_ DNA by PCR performed at the Public Health Agency of Canada, Winnipeg, Canada.

_Anaplasma_ serology performed retrospectively on blood samples collected at days 13, 31, and 52, showed a greater than 4-fold rise in _A. phagocytophilum_ IgG titres from less than 1:64 to 1:2048 (for both convalescent sera). Serologies for Rocky Mountain spotted fever and Lyme disease were both negative.

This case presents a number of clinical dilemmas and diagnostic challenges that contributed towards the delay in the recognition of this patient's infection. Firstly, this is only the 2nd laboratory-confirmed case of _A. phagocytophilum_ to be identified in Alberta since 2009 and while it is a recognized tick-borne infection, the degree of clinical suspicion and awareness is significantly lower when compared with _Borrelia burgdorferi_ and _Rickettsia rickettsii_.

Secondly, populations of the competent tick vectors for this agent, _Ixodes scapularis_ and possibly _I. pacificus_, are not yet established in Alberta, which further reduces the perception of an infection due to _A. phagocytophilum_. Since 2007, there has been a provincial passive surveillance program for the detection of _B. burgdorferi_ in _Ixodes_ ticks collected from companion animals. However, apart from two studies conducted prior to 2013 (2,3), _A. phagocytophilum_ is not always tested for; therefore the current prevalence of infection in the permissive tick species remains unknown.

Thirdly, the initial manifestations of the infection are non-specific, such as fever, chills, myalgias, and headaches. The characteristic erythema migrans rash, a frequently noted feature of _B. burgdorferi_, or the maculopapular rash of a rickettsial infection is absent in an _Anaplasma_ infection, which further reduces the index of clinical suspicion, especially in an area where no previous cases have been described. Antibiotic stewardship policies promote an observational approach in areas where tick-borne infections are not endemic as most signs and symptoms following a tick exposure will be a consequence of reactions to the tick saliva, and will subside either without treatment or with use of allergic medications.

Fourthly, the appearance of antibodies to _A. phagocytophilum_ are reported to occur at 7 to 10 days after the onset of symptoms, whereas in this case the patient was serologically negative around day 13 after onset of symptoms. Microscopic examination of peripheral blood films and/or molecular testing of whole blood may have provided an answer; however, due to the low index of suspicion, this testing was not performed.

_Anaplasma_ infections are not nationally notifiable in Canada, hence it is difficult to gauge the extent and frequency of human infections occurring in the various provinces. A study by Dibernardo et al (2) and Krakowetz et al (3) on adult ticks collected at various time periods from companion dogs and cats, found varying prevalence of infections for this organism by province. For Alberta either 3 percent or 6 percent of _Ixodes_ ticks were positive, although some of the ticks may have been acquired from outside the province.

Ticks can also be dispersed by a number of other hosts including migratory birds. The patient lives in an area close to a Provincial Park, which has been listed as a migratory flyway route. Hence it is a reasonable supposition that the infected tick was a hitchhiker and the patient was the unfortunate recipient of the infected tick bite.

With global climate changes, it is possible that new localities will become more favourable for tick establishment. Consequently, as migrating birds continue to introduce these ticks to habitats that are newly permissive for their survival and reproduction, local foci of infected tick populations may become established and in turn pose a risk to visitors and local inhabitants. Therefore on-going surveillance and investigations will be a prudent approach to determine the extent to which tick populations are becoming established in Alberta.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Fonseca and colleagues for their submission above of the 2nd case human infection due to _Anaplasma phagocytophilum_ reported in Alberta, Canada.

Anaplasmosis due to _A. marginale_, is a nationally notifiable disease in Canada (http://www.inspection.gc.ca/animals/terrestrial-animals/diseases/immediately-notifiable/anaplasmosis/eng/1319738331963/1319810963903). _A. marginale_ is an obligate intra-erythrocytic parasite that affects domestic and wild ruminants, including cattle, sheep, goats and deer (http://www.inspection.gc.ca/animals/terrestrial-animals/diseases/immediately-notifiable/anaplasmosis/fact-sheet/eng/1329525231981/1329525339802). In Canada it is primarily a disease of cattle and is spread by ticks, as well a biting flies or through contaminated medical instruments. _A. marginale_ does not infect humans.

However, anaplasmosis due to _A. phagocytophilum_ is a zoonotic disease, which is called human granulocytic anaplasmosis (HGA) in humans. _A. phagocytophilum_ is an obligate intra-granulocytic parasite that is transmitted by _Ixodes scapularis_ and _I. pacificus_ in North America, and its distribution corresponds to that of Lyme disease, but at a much lower incidence.

At present HGA is reportable in Manitoba, but apparently not in any other jurisdiction in Canada, nor to the Public Health Agency of Canada (https://www.gov.mb.ca/health/publichealth/cdc/protocol/anaplasmosis.pdf).
Areas with evidence of _A. phagocytophilum_-infected blacklegged tick populations include Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, southern Quebec, eastern, southwestern & northwestern Ontario, and southern Manitoba, with the highest prevalence rates seen in Manitoba, New Brunswick, and Quebec (https://www.gov.mb.ca/health/publichealth/cdc/protocol/anaplasmosis.pdf).

Since HGA became provincially reportable on 1 Jan 2015 in Manitoba, there have been 21 cases of HGA in the province (https://www.gov.mb.ca/health/publichealth/cdc/tickborne/docs/tbd_report2016.pdf). One case of HGA has previously been reported in Alberta (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2770309/). No human cases have been reported so far in Nova Scotia or in New Brunswick (https://novascotia.ca/dhw/cdpc/documents/2017_Tick_Borne_Disease_Response_Plan.pdf and http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/dog-diseases-enter-new-brunswick-1.4209193, respectively).

However, infection with _A. phagocytophilum_ has been reported in other animals (https://books.google.com/books?id=9GsWDgAAQBAJ&pg=PA18&lpg=PA18&dq=anaplasmosis+in+canada+gideon&source): a dog in British Columbia (http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S187603410800004X), 3 dogs (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2711468/) and 1 horse (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3398529/) in Saskatchewan, a horse in Ontario https://www.wormsandgermsblog.com/2015/11/articles/animals/horses/equine-anaplasmosis-ontario/), and a horse in Nova Scotia (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3078012/).
