A scientific puzzle: some Turks have contracted avian influenza virus
infection but are not ill
-----------------------------------------------
2 young brothers, ages 4 and 5, who have tested positive for the
A(H5N1) avian virus but shown no symptoms of the disease were being
closely watched at Kecioren Hospital here on Tuesday [10 Jan 2006].
Doctors are unsure whether they are for the 1st time seeing human
bird flu in its earliest stages or whether they are discovering that
infection with the A(H5N1) virus does not always lead to illness.
In any case, the highly unusual cluster of 5 cases detected here in
Turkey's capital over the last 3 days -- all traceable to contact
with sick birds -- is challenging some of the doctors' assumptions
about bird flu and giving them new insights into how it spreads and
causes disease. Since none of the 5 have died, it raises the
possibility that human bird flu is not as deadly as currently
thought, and that many mild cases in Asian countries may have gone unreported.
"The 2 brothers are a very interesting finding that may for the 1st
time give us a chance to monitor the human response to the disease,"
said Dr. Guenael Rodier, who is leading a World Health Organization
(WHO) Team now in Turkey. The avian influenza outbreaks and
infections in this country in the last week have perplexed
international scientists on many fronts. Turkey is the 1st country
outside eastern Asia to have human cases, and the 1st one anywhere to
have so many separate animal outbreaks simultaneously. In one week,
Turkey announced 15 confirmed human cases of A(H5N1); Asia has seen
only about 140 in the space of 5 years. In that same week, Turkish
agriculture authorities announced bird outbreaks in 16 cities, from
Aydin on the West coast to Van in the far east; in Asia, outbreaks
have occurred more sporadically.
"We are not yet sure of the mechanism," said Keith Sumption, an
expert with the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization in
Rome. A senior scientist from that group is scheduled to arrive here
tomorrow. On the human side, the 5 cases in Ankara hospitals are
different from those elsewhere in Asia. 4 of the 5 display only mild
symptoms, or no symptoms at all. Also, although all 5 have had some
recent contact with birds, Dr. Rodier said, they are people who live
on the fringes of a major city, not farmers or people who keep birds
in their backyards. The group includes 2 sets of brothers: the 2 who
show no symptoms at all, and a set from the distant suburbs who
developed mild symptoms after contact with gloves that had been used
to dispose of a dead duck. The 5th is a 65-year-old man from inside
the city itself, who the Turkish health ministry says had "close
contact with a chicken," without elaborating on the details.
In addition to observing the boys, who are all being treated with
antiviral medicines, scientists are struggling with other issues,
particularly the possibility that bird flu might not be so deadly as
previously thought. A study released Tuesday [10 Jan 2006] in the
Archives of Internal Medicine suggested that the A(H5N1) virus might
cause a wide spectrum of disease, but that doctors in other parts of
Asia might detect only the severest cases, the ones that went to the
hospital. The 4 children in Ankara bolster that suggestion.
In Ankara, where the government has been sending out vans with
loudspeakers urging people to report symptoms and avoid contact with
animals, even people with mild symptoms are being checked for bird
flu, meaning that milder cases are more likely to be detected than
they are in other parts of Asia. "I'm sure that part of the
explanation for the high number of cases in Turkey is better
surveillance," said Maria Cheng, a spokeswoman for the WHO in Geneva.
Residents of urban districts of the capital said almost nobody here
keeps birds, instead buying poultry at the supermarket. But poultry
is found all around Turkey, even here. The huge number of animal
outbreaks across the country is also perplexing, scientists said. One
theory is that migrating birds seeded the disease in various areas in
late December [2005], but that is contradicted by the fact that no
outbreaks have been reported in adjacent countries where the birds
would also have passed. Another possibility is that poultry-selling
practices in Turkey contributed to the spread. In Dogubayazit City,
home to 4 of Turkey's 15 human A(H5N1) cases, people said the big
chicken farms often send huge trucks of old birds to the town,
selling them at low cost to poor farmers. The last truck arrived 2 or
3 weeks ago, they said. If even one bird on such a truck had bird
flu, experts said, it could have quickly infected the others on
board, disseminating A(H5N1) to many villages. "We are very keen to
support the Turkish authorities in exploring the details of the
movements of poultry," Mr. Sumption said.

[A provisional assessment of these observations might be that, in
Turkey, exposure to H5N1 avian influenza virus infection may be more
widespread than previously supposed and that the virus may be less
virulent in humans than inferred from the East Asian experience. - Mod.CP]
[Again this moderator is sticking her neck out on the chopping block,
but her favorite mantra comes to mind - "seek and ye shall
find". From the myriad of newswires that have been posted related to
the ongoing situation in Turkey it appears as though (in Turkey)
there is testing of individuals with known contact with diseased
birds including those with mild symptoms and those with with no
symptoms. This is in contrast with reports we have posted from H5N1
human disease in Southeast Asia and the Far East. ProMED-mail has
repeatedly "called for" information on background serosurveys that
may have been conducted in areas where the H5N1 virus has been
circulating to address just this issue of whether the severe cases
with the high case fatality rates are just the tip of the iceberg in
terms of clinical manifestations associated with human infections
with the H5N1 virus. Perhaps the heightened awareness of the
population in Turkey, combined with a heightened awareness of the
health sector, and the capacity of the health sector to conduct more
extensive laboratory testing is leading to the identification of much
milder expressions of human disease related to H5N1 infection. - Mod.MPP]
