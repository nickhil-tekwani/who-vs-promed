ALMA ATA (Dec. 3) XINHUA - An outbreak of the plague in eastern Kazakhstan
has killed seven people and infected more than 600 others, the Interfax
News Agency reported Thursday. Between 40 and 50 people are believed to be
infected every day in the East Kazakhstan state capital of Ust-Kamenogorsk
as the disease spreads rapidly through the population.

The Kazakh government has been forced to import medicines to fight the
plague as none of the Commonwealth of Independent States has ever produced
drugs for the disease. A fire which destroyed 90,000 hectares of forest in
east Kazakhstan last year drove huge numbers of rodents out of their
usually habitat into residential areas where they passed diseases to
domestic animals and people.

[The comment that the rodent situation has been building since last year
suggests
that the introduction of plague into the mix has been quite recent. It is
assumed
that this is bubonic and not pneumonic plague. - Mod.JW
