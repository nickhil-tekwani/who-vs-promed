The Colombian National Army has confirmed that the disease that affected several soldiers who provided security at the Jagua de Ibirico military base in Cesar, was Chagas disease. As a result of this pathology, 2 soldiers died in recent days and 7 more remain in hospital, some of them in intensive care units. According to the institution, the affected soldiers are under medical observation and permanent monitoring at the Central Military Hospital.

In addition, the Health Directorate, through epidemiological teams, continues to carry out the follow-up on affected soldiers. This situation began last weekend [25 & 26 Dec 2021] when the soldiers began to show symptoms. "The uniformed men have undergone multiple examinations and assessments by a multidisciplinary team of specialists, which determined that the origin and causes of their cardiovascular disease are secondary to Chagas disease," the Army said.

[Infections with _Trypanosoma cruzi_, Chagas disease, are traditionally transmitted by the triatome bugs. However, food especially fruit juice may be infected with infected bugs are crushed in the juice during preparation. In outbreaks like this one, a common food or drink source are the most probable explanation.

An outbreak in Brazil in Santa Catarina in 2005 was due to contaminated sugar cane juice and an outbreak in Caracas, Venezuela in 2007 was due to contaminated guava juice. - Mod.EP
