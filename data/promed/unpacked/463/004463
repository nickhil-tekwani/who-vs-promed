In the Syrdarya [Sirdaryo] region, a case of anthrax infection in humans was detected. The Service for Sanitary and Epidemiological Welfare and Public Health (SES) stated that there is no reason for concern, a Podrobno.uz correspondent reports.

The Service for Sanitary and Epidemiological Welfare and Public Health confirmed the detection of anthrax but emphasized that "at present, the epidemiological situation is stable and there is no cause for concern. In addition, with this disease, quarantine applies only to cattle and small ruminants."

"This disease differs in that it is not transmitted from person to person. The disease is transmitted to humans only in the process of slaughtering cattle and small cattle infected with this disease, as well as due to contact with raw meat," SES representatives emphasized.

Currently, veterinary workers have vaccinated cattle and small cattle on the territory of the Zaamin makhalla of the Sardoba region.

"Syrdarya (Sirdaryo) region is located in the central part of Uzbekistan, on the territory of the Hungry steppe (Mirzachul) on the left side of the Syrdarya River" (https://blogs.timesofisrael.com/ancient-and-unique-uzbekistan-syrdarya-region-i/).

"The economy is based on cotton and cereal crops, with strong reliance on irrigation and cattle breeding. Minor crops include forage plants, vegetables, melons, gourds, potatoes, maize, a variety of fruit and grapes. Industry consists of construction materials, irrigation equipment and raw-cotton processing. Syrdarya contains one of Uzbekistan's largest hydroelectric power plants, which generates one-third of the country's electricity" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirdaryo_Region).

WOAH (formerly OIE) rarely have any anthrax data from Uzbekistan; their last report was in 2004. At best, the Uzbeks will merely admit it is there but nothing more. The control is minimal, which is why it regularly overflows into bordering southeast Kyrgyzstan, in the Fergana Valley. Therefore, Uzbek ability to adequately handle anthrax outbreaks and human cases is unclear. We do not expect a formal report on this case. - Mod.MHJ
