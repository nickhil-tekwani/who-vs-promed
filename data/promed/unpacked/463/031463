Viet Nam: avian influenza situation - WHO update 4
-----------------------------------------------
WHO is aware of reports of a new laboratory-confirmed case of influenza A
(H5) virus infection in a 42-year-old man from Hanoi. The patient is alive,
but his older brother, a 45-year-old man from Thai Binh province, fell ill
in early January [2005] and subsequently died of a respiratory illness.
Laboratory tests on the deceased man are reportedly negative for influenza
A (H5) virus infection. WHO is seeking confirmation from the Ministry of
Health.
The Ministry of Health is conducting epidemiological investigations into
these cases, and WHO will keep in close contact with the Ministry of Health
over the progress and findings of these investigations.

Viet Nam: new human case of avian influenza A (H5) virus infection identified
-----------------------------------------------
Viet Nam has just found that a middle-aged person from its capital city
Hanoi was infected with the avian influenza A (H5N1) virus, the Viet Nam
Central Television reported on Wed 19 Jan 2005. After having conducted many
tests, the Tropical Disease Institute in Hanoi concluded on Wed 19 Jan 2005
that samples from its 43-year-old patient tested positive for the H5N1
virus. Since admission to the institute on 13 Jan 2005 with symptoms of
high temperature and damaged lungs, the patient has felt better.
The patient has not had contact with fowl and does not live in an avian
influenza hit area, the television report stated, noting that the patient
took care of the patient's elder brother who died of pneumonia on 9 Jan 2005.

[The interesting feature of this report is the implication that the
surviving brother may have contracted infection during care of an elder
brother who died of pneumonia. Reliance on identification by age, however,
results in ambiguity (see the following post), because, if these 2 brothers
correspond to the 2 in the preceding report, it was the survivor who tested
positive and the deceased who tested negative. - Mod.CP]

Viet Nam: WHO increases avian influenza A (H5N1) count
-----------------------------------------------
The World Health Organization (WHO) today [Tue 18 Jan 2004] added 2 more
cases to its tally of confirmed human cases of H5N1 avian influenza in Viet
Nam, and WHO officials reportedly said another 10 suspected cases are under
investigation there.
The agency increased its case count for Viet Nam to 33, including 25
deaths, up from 31 cases with 23 deaths as of 13 Jan 2005. With 17 cases,
including 12 deaths in Thailand, the total since late 2003 comes to 50
cases, 37 of them fatal [now 51 cases and 37 deaths. - Mod.CP].
WHO spokeswoman Maria Cheng said Vietnamese officials have reported that up
to 10 more suspected human cases are being investigated and that the
disease has spread to all regions of the country, according to a Reuters
report today [Tue 18 Jan 2004]. Previous reports indicated that recent
outbreaks were limited to southern Viet Nam.
On 13 Jan 2005, the WHO had reported 31 human cases with 23 deaths in Viet
Nam. The next day, the agency said it had received informal reports of 2
more cases, one of them fatal. The fatal case was in an 18-year-old woman
from the southern province of Hau Giang who had died 10 Jan 2005. The other
case involved a 35-year-old woman from Tra Vinh, also in the south, who was
in critical condition.
Today's [Tue 18 Jan 2004] updated case count showed 2 more deaths than
listed in the 13 Jan 2005 tally, but the WHO didn't make clear who the
other victim was.
At least 4 people have died of avian influenza virus infection in Viet Nam
since late December 2004, according to the WHO and other reports. They have
included 2 boys, aged 6 and 9, a 16-year-old girl, and the 18-year-old
woman from Hau Giang province. Besides the 35-year-old woman in Tra Vinh,
an 18-year-old woman remained in critical condition today [Tue 18 Jan
2004], according to an Agence France-Presse report.
The change in the WHO case count came after media reports of several new
suspected cases in Viet Nam over the past few days. A Voice of America
report today [Tue 18 Jan 2004] said a 17-year-old boy had died of suspected
avian influenza on 15 Jan 2005 in the southern province of Bac Lieu. The
report also said a woman with suspected avian influenza died in Tra Vinh on
14 Jan 2005, but it did not list her age.
In addition, a Reuters report posted on the ProMED-mail Web-site yesterday
said 4 other Vietnamese with suspected avian influenza had been
hospitalized on 15 and 16 Jan 2005. The report said a 48-year-old man, his
younger brother, and a 62-year-old man were hospitalized 15 Jan 2005 in
Hanoi, and the 48-year-old subsequently died. In addition, a 14-year-old
boy from Tra Vinh was hospitalized 16 Jan 2005 in Ho Chi Minh City. But a
physician from Hanoi's Clinical Institute for Tropical Disease denied that
the 48-year-old man had avian influenza, according to a report today from
the state news service Viet Nam News. The story quoted officials as saying
no human cases have yet been confirmed in northern Viet Nam.
Yesterday [17 Jan 2004], Viet Nam suspended poultry imports and tightened
other measures to control avian influenza, according to the Viet Nam News
Agency and other news services. Prime Minister Phan Van Khai said imported
poultry and poultry products must be seized and destroyed.
The report said a total of about 250 000 chickens, geese, and quail in 18
cities and provinces, mostly in the Mekong Delta, have been destroyed in
disease-control efforts in recent weeks. The Prime minister also called for
the sacrifice of all poultry flocks in which the disease has surfaced and
for strict bans on the transport of poultry into and out of affected areas.
In other developments, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) reiterated its concern about avian flu in an update issued 14 Jan
2005. "It is likely that H5N1 infection among birds has become endemic to
the region [East Asia] and that human infections will continue to occur,"
the CDC said. "If these H5N1 avian influenza viruses gain the ability for
efficient and sustained transmission between humans, there is little
preexisting natural immunity to H5N1 in the human population, and an
influenza pandemic could result, with high rates of illness and death," the
statement said.
The CDC said H5N1 vaccines are under development, but mass production "is
some time off." Meanwhile, new research suggests that H5 viruses are
becoming more capable of causing disease in mammals, which increases the
risk that the virus will evolve and acquire the ability to spread from
person to person, the agency said.

[The practice of identifying cases by their ages alone is clearly
unsatisfactory and may result in double-counting and other inaccuracies.
ProMED-mail believes that the Cumulative Count of Confirmed Cases updated
regularly on the WHO web-site is the most reliable source of definitive
information. - Mod.CP]
