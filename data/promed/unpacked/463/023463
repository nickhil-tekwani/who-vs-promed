UN confirms avian flu death in Cambodian girl, case in Egypt
------------------------------------------------------------
Cambodia
--------
The World Health Organization (WHO) today [2 Aug 2011] confirmed
previous media reports of a fatal case of H5N1 avian influenza in a
4-year-old girl in Cambodia [see also: Avian influenza, human (52):
Cambodia (BM) 20110729.2279]. The girl was from Chork Reaksmey village
in Banteay Meanchey province, the WHO said, citing the Cambodian
health ministry. She got sick on 11 Jul 2011, was initially treated by
local private practitioners, was hospitalized on 18 Jul 2011, and died
2 days later, the agency said. Poultry deaths have been reported in
the girl's village, and she was said to have been exposed to dead
poultry, the statement said. 13 contacts of the girl were tested for
H5N1, all with negative results, and enhanced surveillance at local
medical facilities has yielded no evidence of increases in flu-like
illness or severe respiratory infections (see Avian influenza -
situation in Cambodia - WHO update 5
http://www.who.int/csr/don/2011_08_02/en/index.html).

Meanwhile, H5N1 recently killed 100 backyard chickens and ducks at 2
villages elsewhere in Banteay Meanchey province, according to a report
that Cambodia filed yesterday [1 Aug 2011] with the World Organization
for Animal Health (OIE). Officials culled another 480 birds to stop
the outbreak, the report said. The source of the outbreak was listed
as unknown.

[According to the WHO table of confirmed human cases of avian A/(H5N1)
virus infection
(http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/country/cases_table_2011_08_02/en/index.html)
as of 2 Aug 2011 there have now been 556 cases globally and 325
fatalities. 16 of the cases and 14 fatalities have occurred in
Cambodia.

Egypt
-----
In addition, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization
(FAO) today [2 Aug 2011] confirmed a case of highly pathogenic avian
influenza in Egypt. The FAO report [available at
http://empres-i.fao.org/empres-i/2/obd?idOutbreak=164064] said the
case was in Al Beheira governorate in the northern part of the country
but supplied no details of the age and sex of the person and how
transmission likely occurred. A positive test was confirmed on 27 Jul
2011.

[Further details of these cases and confirmation by WHO are awaited. A
map of the governorates of Egypt can be accessed at
