Angola: Comments on the Nature of the Marburg Hemorrhagic Fever Outbreak
--------------------------------------------------
As an internist and tropical medicine specialist, I am interested in
the outbreak of Marburg hemorrhagic fever in Angola. I know little
about diseases caused by filoviruses, and certain points intrigue me.
Firstly, this is the 1st epidemic caused by a filovirus which has
developed in an urban environment, whereas previously they have been
rural zoonoses. Which means of contagion allows an urban epidemic? In
an urban zone rodents are the first suspects, but could fructivorous
bats, already accused in Durba and in the epidemics of Ebola
hemorrhagic fever, be the origin of the spread?
Secondly, 75 percent of the deceased are children of less than 5
years of age (thus not in school and generally carried on the backs
of their mothers), whereas in the 1st epidemic of Marburg hemorrhagic
fever which developed in Durba in Zaire, miners and their associates
were the victims. There is probably a local factor which has not been
highlighted yet. Several assumptions can be considered: viral
variation, a local activity responsible for the spread, or infection
of children admitted to the hospitals of Uige for another infection
[measles, malaria, and typhoid have all been reported from the
adjacent Democratic Republic of Congo (see: WHO Bulletin of 19 Jan
2005)].
Thirdly, more surprising is the fact that mothers are little affected
despite very close contact with their infants.
Finally, it seems to me that the high mortality compared to the
sporadic outbreaks (25 percent) and the epidemic of Durba (82
percent) are explainable by the fact that the population initially
consults traditional practitioners and "kimbandeiros," since the
disease is locally ascribed to fate. They go to hospital only after
failure of these treatments and often arrive moribund. The sparse
resources available to the centers of provincial care are also in
question as well as contaminations by re-used needles.

[This outbreak -- like prior outbreaks of viral hemorrhagic fevers --
began outside the urban environment but transmission was potentiated
in the hospital setting. The index case may well have been an adult
male whose wife was infected after caring for him, and who then
infected their child(ren). An infected child was then hospitalized
in an environment where infectious disease isolation is not routinely
practiced, and where supplies are limited so that needles and
syringes (or other medical devices) may not be adequately sterilized
between uses. Beds may have become contaminated and although washed
between patients, perhaps not sufficiently to eliminate the virus.
All of the above were described as sources of transmission in prior
viral hemorrhagic fever outbreaks in which the hospital served as a
potentiator for transmission of the virus.
The outbreak then took hold in the pediatric ward, among patients
that were already admitted for other illnesses not related to
Marburg. Because these were hospitalized children, the direct
contact with their families was a bit more limited than if they had
stayed home. But I suspect that there was more transmission to the
family members who then stayed at home and were ill (and died) at
home, away from the attention of the formal health sector. That
would explain the early apparent waves in the pediatric population,
but now the shifting age distribution involving the hospital staff,
and probably family members of the children. I suspect the final
epidemiologic reports will reflect this.
With the above theory, the index case probably had the more
"traditional route" (whatever that may be) of primary infection --
exposure to bat droppings (as postulated from an isolated Ebola case
related to spelunking in Kenya, and for the outbreak in miners in the
Democratic Republic of Congo), or exposure to an infected primate
through skinning and preparing for food (I do not know if monkeys are
eaten in Angola, but I suspect they are, especially in a zone where
food resources are limited).
I suspect that the observed high mortality rate may be a function of
"in-hospital" mortality rate, and the true rate may be closer to that
seen in the Durba outbreak. The disparity from earlier reported
mortalities with Marburg may be related to either a different strain,
or more likely to level of medical care available (earlier outbreaks
were in more highly developed areas). It will be interesting to see
if an analysis of CFR by age group indicates a differential based on
age. A true CFR would require doing a baseline serosurvey in the
community to establish the denominator of infected individuals. It
is possible that there are milder cases that are not within the
radarscope of the health sector. Given the high emotional state in
the area, I suspect that such a serosurvey will have to wait until
after things quiet down and "return to normal".
Obviously this is all speculation, and since there really haven't
been many well-described epidemics of Marburg fever, this current
epidemic will be contributing greatly to the knowledge base of the
disease. - Mod.MPP]

Angola: Death Toll exceeds 200
------------------------------
Health officials in Angola said on Mon 11 Apr 2005 that 203 people
out of 221 infected with Marburg virus had died, as local and
international health workers race to stem the spread of the disease.
Most of the dead were children under 5 years of age, health workers
in the northern Angolan province of Uige -- the most affected region
-- said. It is the deadliest Marburg virus outbreak ever recorded.
Panic has spread through the region, with some people hiding their
infected relatives and dead bodies from health workers, compounding
the problem. Officials also told reporters that a local tradition of
delaying the burial of loved ones risked increasing the spread of the
deadly virus. Health workers also said local residents lacked
sufficient information about the disease and that hospitals failed to
observe basic rules of hygiene that could help stem the epidemic.
The epidemic first spread in Uige in October 2005. The UN has
appealed to international donors for US$3.5 million to help contain
the spread of the virus. The World Health Organization (WHO), the US
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Medecins sans
Frontieres (MSF) have all deployed teams to Uige. But with panic and
fear taking hold of the local population, the doctors were not
welcomed. According to the Boston Globe, when health workers from the
WHO and MSF -- dressed head to toe in air-filled protective suits --
arrived in Uige, residents threw rocks at them to keep them away from
their homes.
Explaining the residents' fear, Dr Pierre Rollin, head of the
diagnostic group at the US Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, told the Boston Globe that the population believed that
"if you go to the hospital, you're dead".
"I don't think we have a good grasp at the size of the outbreak yet,"
Dick Thompson, a spokesman for the WHO, said on Monday. "There may
have been a turning of the corner in terms of returning the [WHO]
alert teams to the field, but I think that we don't have a good
surveillance system elsewhere in the country."
