Togo has eliminated African human trypanosomiasis (AHT), also known as sleeping illness, on its territory. It is no longer a public health threat in Togo.

The WHO (World Health Organization) has certified that the country has met all the criteria for eliminating this endemic disease in the country. The announcement was made by the Minister of Health, Moustapha Mijiyawa, in a statement. "This report was reviewed by a group of independent experts convened by the WHO regional office. Based on the evidence on the report and the recommendation of these experts, the report was validated on [22 Jun 2020]," said the Minister.

The WHO congratulated the health authorities on this "brilliant success" and recommended that the authorities "continue to monitor" and "continue to guarantee quality care for patients throughout the country".

For more than 10 years now, in 2018, Togo has not reported any cases of AHT on its soil, the transmission having been interrupted by the combined monitoring and sensitization efforts deployed by the government.

Present in nearly 36 countries, AHT is a vector-borne parasitic disease. The parasite is a protozoan belonging to the _Trypanosoma_ genus. It is transmitted to humans by the bite of a tsetse (_Glossina_) fly that has itself been infected from human beings or animals carrying pathogenic parasites.

Togo's success over AHT makes it the 1st African country to eradicate African human trypanosomiasis when, just a year ago, Togo was also recognized internationally for having completely eradicated lymphatic filariasis, another parasitic disease in the country.
