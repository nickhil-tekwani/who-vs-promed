The Dutch food safety authority NVWA has detected _Potato spindle tuber viroid_ (PSTVd) in samples of seedless pepper [capsicum] plants at 4 different companies. The starting material originated from Israel, most likely the source of the infection. The companies are from the Peel and Maas region (1) [Limburg] and Westland (3) [South Holland]. The infections have been found in vegetatively bred seedless pepper plants. All stem from the same starting material.

The contamination came to light thanks to an alert from the breeder. The plants were not showing any symptoms yet. The infection was identified at 4 sites of [the first] 3 companies: in respectively 8 plants at a nursery, in 590 plants at another, in 100 plants in a demo-greenhouse and in 1616 plants at a production company. The contaminated plants have been burned and destroyed.

PSTVd is a quarantine organism included in the [EU] Phyto Directive. In the past, it has been found in dahlias, potatoes and tomatoes in the Netherlands [but] was never found in peppers before. NVWA is informing phytosanitary authorities of other countries [and] is also investigating any further spread.

[_Potato spindle tuber viroid_ (PSTVd; type member of genus _Pospiviroid_) is an important pathogen of solanaceous crops including potato, tomato and capsicum. It causes spindle tuber (or "gothic") disease in potato and bunchy top in tomato. Yield losses can be up to 65 per cent in potato and up to 50 per cent in tomato. Many solanaceous ornamental and weed species are also susceptible to PSTVd and may serve as pathogen reservoirs. PSTVd has been included on the European Plant Protection Organsation (EPPO) A2 quarantine list.

Symptoms in potato may include spindly shoots, stunting of plants, severely distorted tubers ('spindles') and delayed sprouting. In tomatoes, symptoms include leaf chlorosis and distortion, shortening of internodes, stunting of plants and absence of flowers. Capsicum plants show stunting and a loss of plant vigour but often display only mild symptoms of leaf distortion. Infection of solanaceous ornamentals is often symptomless. All varieties of tomato and potato appear to be susceptible, but mild strains causing latent infections in some host cultivars exist.

PSTVd is seed transmitted at a rate of up to 100 per cent, depending on the host cultivar. It is assumed to have spread among potato germplasm collections all over the world via infected true seed. Tomato seed has also been shown to constitute a considerable quarantine risk (ProMED-mail post 20140122.2222560). Spread occurs also via infected plants or vegetative plant parts (potato seed tubers, tomato and capsicum explants), pollen, mechanical means (including insects and during handling procedures) and plant-to-plant contact. Only in the presence of _Potato leafroll virus_ can PSTVd also be transmitted by an aphid vector (_Myzus persicae_).

Due to the multiple potential transmission routes and the large number of host species, both epidemiology and control of PSTVd are complicated. The presence of PSTVd and other pospiviroids in a number of symptomless reservoir hosts has been reported from several countries and must be considered a threat to crops. Furthermore, PSTVd is exceptionally stable and can survive in dried sap or plant residue for considerable times. Disease management relies mainly on removal of infected plants and other possible sources of inoculum, phytosanitary procedures, as well as use of certified PSTVd-free seed and other planting material.

Pospiviroids are considered an emerging phytosanitary threat worldwide because of their potential effects on a number of very important crops. Commercial imports of seed or planting stock carry a high risk of an incursion and the importance of reliable certification and screening schemes before release to growers has been recognised.

In the report above, an introduction with infected seedlings from the Middle East is suspected. However, it is not clear whether the breeder who raised the alarm is situated there or has found the infection in the Netherlands in imported planting stock. In the latter case, considering PSTVd is already present in the Netherlands in a variety of hosts, it would seem that transmission from local reservoirs may also be a possibility.
