Research from Otago University has found the numbers of people with a potentially lethal 'flesh eating' bug is on the rise. A patient in Palmerston North is the latest in New Zealand to be treated for a rare and potentially lethal "flesh-eating" bug.

MidCentral District Health Board this morning confirmed a patient had been admitted to Palmerston North Hospital with necrotising fasciitis, a disease which eats away at deep skin tissue, in the last three months. Medical Officer of Health Rob Weir said the man was being treated through a mixture of surgery on infected areas and antibiotics.

There was little fear of the disease spreading from patient to patient, he said. "These cases are very rare. It usually appears through some kind of general trauma. Once it starts it typically spreads quite rapidly." Dr Weir said there had been about 20 cases of necrotising fasciitis in the Manawatu since 1996.

Necrotising fasciitis is a severe bacterial infection that causes rapid destruction of soft tissue. Most severely affected people need extensive surgery and sometimes limb amputation. University of Otago researchers last year released a first ever nation-wide assessment of the incidence of the bug, commonly referred to as the 'flesh-eating disease' [Das DK, Baker MG, Venugopal K. Increasing incidence of necrotizing fasciitis in New Zealand: a nationwide study over the period 1990 to 2006. J Infect. 2011 Dec; 63(6):429-33. Epub 2011 Aug 16]. It showed the disease has risen from fewer than 10 cases a year in 1990 to more than 70 cases a year in 2006.

The study identified 812 cases between 1990 and 2006, of whom 148 died - a 21 per cent fatality rate. Associate Professor Michael Baker said the rising incidence of the disease was a cause for concern. "Although this disease remains uncommon, it's feared because of its speed of onset, high fatality rate, and the severe tissue damage its causes." A necrotising fasciitis infection can start with a minor skin injury or wound before progressing to severe local pain and a high fever, Dr Baker said. "The pain is caused by a very rapid spread of the infection into deep soft tissue and is not always obvious from first inspection of the skin. Rapid treatment is absolutely vital to save lives."

The research found Maori and Pacific people, older people, and men are most vulnerable to necrotising fasciitis infection - though the reasons that are not clear. Causes of rising infection rates may include greater virulence of the bacteria, decreased resistance because of other chronic illnesses, environmental factors such as a rise in household overcrowding, and decreased access to health services because of rising socio-economic inequality, Dr Baker said.

[Necrotizing fasciitis, also called "flesh-eating disease" is a rapidly progressive bacterial infection that destroys the soft tissues covering muscle (fascia). Patients usually complain of intense pain in the involved region that initially may seem out of proportion to the external appearance of the overlying skin. Aggressive surgical debridement of all necrotic tissue and administration of antibiotics are necessary. However, surgical intervention is often delayed after hospital admission, because these infections can be difficult to recognize in their early stages, and deep muscle necrosis may not be appreciated early on. The commonest type of bacteria causing necrotizing fasciitis is _Streptococcus pyogenes_ (group A streptococcus), but fungi (such as mucor) and other bacteria (such as _Staphylococcus aureus_, _Vibro vulnificus_ and mixtures of multiple aerobic and anaerobic bacterial species can cause necrotizing fasciitis.

In the study referred to in the above news report, the researchers found between 1990 and 2006 there was a highly significant rise in annual incidence and mortality rates of necrotizing fasciitis from 0.18 to 1.69 and from 0 to 0.3 per 100 000 person-years, respectively in New Zealand [Das DK, Baker MG, Venugopal K. Increasing incidence of necrotizing fasciitis in New Zealand: a nationwide study over the period 1990 to 2006. J Infect. 2011 Dec; 63(6):429-33. Epub 2011 Aug 16. Available at: http://www.sciencedirect.com.ezproxy2.library.drexel.edu/science/article/pii/S0163445311004580]. The causes of this increase were unknown. The case fatality was 20.8%. Disease risk was highest in the elderly, males, and Pacific and Maori populations. As in the above news report, this study from New Zealand did not specify the microbial etiologies in the cases of necrotizing fasciitis.

District Health Boards (DHBs) in New Zealand are organizations established by the New Zealand Public Health and Disability Act 2000, responsible for ensuring the provision of health and disability services to populations within a defined geographical area (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_Health_Board). There are 20 DHBs. Palmerston North is an inland city in the Manawatu-Wanganui region of the North Island of New Zealand, with a estimated population of 82,400 in 2011 (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palmerston_North).
