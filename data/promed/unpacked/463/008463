[In response to our request, Dr Mikio Kimura of the Infectious Disease
Surveillance Center, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Japan
(<kimumiki@nih.go.jp>) provided the following information on these
cases.
The importations were 3 males, aged 3, 21, and 30 yrs, and 2 females,
aged 27 and 74 yrs. Suspected countries where they contracted cholera
were Indonesia 2 (one Bali, one not specified further), India 2,
Philippines 1; 4 were El tor Ogawa & 1 was El tor not further
specified.
The sixth case was a 63-yr-old symptomless male with no history of
travel [or contact with travelers? - Mod.JW. The strain isolated was El
tor Inaba.
We are grateful to Dr Kimura for these important details. Note that in
his earlier report of imported cases in Japan (ref. (03) above), one
acquired the disease in Bali. That case and the 3 cases contracted in
Philippines were also El tor Ogawa.
Neither Indonesia nor the Philippines has reported to WHO that they
have cholera. Travellers should not be deterred from visiting those
countries, but should take appropriate precautions. - Mod.JW
