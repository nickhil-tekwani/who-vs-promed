Cutaneous anthrax cases at Bolpur, India
----------------------------------------
Another person who ingested meat of the [same] cow died due to anthrax.
_Bacillus anthracis_ has been isolated from clinical materials taken from 3
cases, thus confirming the disease. There was a panic, as the district
authorities could not trace the hide of the dead cow. The main
manifestations were vesicles and ulcers in the skin of upper extremities,
particularly of hands.
District health authorities were advised to vaccinate all cows in the
affected area.
(The name of the village is Sukhbazar, not Sukhbajan, as mentioned by me in
my previous report.)

[Dr Das and I have corresponded in the past over the ongoing high
endemicity of this disease in his area. He does an outstanding job in very
difficult circumstances. I have said this before and it cannot be
over-repeated: if there are human cases of anthrax, it reflects
deficiencies in the veterinary public health services in protecting the
human population and specifically the veterinary animal health services in
ensuring the proper annual vaccination of the livestock in the affected
area and disposal of any affected dead stock. Policies based on reaction
are always too late. Sterne vaccine is one of the cheapest vaccines
anywhere and does a good job in protecting livestock for a 12-month period.
Salvaging of dead animals is sometimes difficult to control even in good
circumstances, and there are numerous problems in this part of West Bengal
and adjoining Orissa. - Mod.MHJ]
