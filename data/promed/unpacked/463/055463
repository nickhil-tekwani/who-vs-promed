Recommended composition of influenza virus vaccines for use in the 2012-2013 northern hemisphere influenza season
----------------------------------------------------------------------
It is recommended that vaccines for use in the 2012-2013 influenza season (northern hemisphere winter) contain the following:

- an A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus;
- an A/Victoria/361/2011 (H3N2)-like virus;
- a B/Wisconsin/1/2010-like virus.

For more information see
Recommended composition of influenza virus vaccines for use in the 2012-2013 influenza season (full report at http://www.who.int/influenza/vaccines/virus/recommendations/201202_recommendation.pdf).

[A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses co-circulated in varying proportions with A(H3N2) and B viruses during the period of September 2011 to February 2012, with low activity in many countries. The majority of A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses were antigenically similar to A/California/7/2009. Vaccines containing A/California/7/2009 antigens stimulated anti-HA antibodies of similar titres against the vaccine virus and recent A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses.

Influenza A(H3N2) viruses were associated with outbreaks in several countries. The majority of recent viruses were antigenically and genetically distinguishable from the vaccine virus A/Perth/16/2009 and were more closely related to A/Victoria/361/2011-like reference viruses. Current vaccines containing A/Perth/16/2009 antigens stimulated antibodies of titres that were lower to most recent influenza A(H3N2) viruses.

Influenza B activity was reported in many countries. The proportion of B/Yamagata/16/88 lineage viruses increased in many parts of the world but B/Victoria/2/87 lineage viruses predominated in some countries, notably in China. The majority of recent B/Victoria/2/87 lineage viruses were antigenically and genetically closely related to B/Brisbane/60/2008. Most recently isolated B/Yamagata/16/88 lineage viruses were antigenically distinguishable from the previous vaccine virus B/Florida/4/2006 and were closely related to B/Wisconsin/1/2010-like viruses. Current vaccines containing B/Brisbane/60/2008 antigens stimulated anti-HA antibodies that had similar titres against the vaccine viruses and recent viruses of the B/Victoria/2/87 lineage; however, titres were lower to recent viruses of the B/Yamagata/16/88 lineage. - Mod.CP]
