There has been a noticeable increase in cases of hand foot and mouth disease, the Collective Prevention Services (CPS) says in a press release and urges parents and guardians, day care centers and play schools to be on alert for an increase in clusters of the disease amongst the school population. CPS advises to take extra measures to prevent outbreaks by washing of hands often with soap and water.

Hand foot and mouth disease is a common viral illness that usually affects infants and children who are 10-years of age or younger. It can sometimes occur in adults. There is no vaccine to protect against the viruses that cause it.

People with symptoms should consult their family physician and take measures to mitigate an increase in the number of cases.

Symptoms include cold-like conditions, fever, mouth sores, loss of appetite, cough, and a skin rash; a non-itchy red rash that develops on the hand and the feet, and sometimes the rash can develop into painful blisters; painful mouth ulcers.

[The causative agent for hand foot and mouth disease (HFMD) is an enterovirus. It is not the same as other diseases that have similar names: foot-and-mouth disease (sometimes called hoof-and-mouth disease). See previous ProMED post Hand, foot & mouth disease - USA (04): (CA) 20160505.4204778 for a discussion of HFMD.

An outbreak of coxsackie virus has hit Derby High School and several students have been affected, officials announced.

"On 19 Sep 2016 several cases of the coxsackie virus were reported to school officials at Derby High School," wrote Principal Martin Pascale in a letter to parents this week. "As a safety precaution, Derby High School will be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected by the facilities management team. In addition, parents are encouraged to check your child/children for signs of a blister rash on the palms of their hands, soles of their feet and inside their mouths. Symptoms may also include a fever."

In addition to the warning to parents, the 23 Sep [2016] football game between Derby and Seymour high schools has been postponed, because 4 members of the Derby team have contracted the virus, reports GameTime CT.

Coxsackie virus, also known as hand, foot, and mouth disease, is "spread through close personal contact. This can occur when there is direct contact with nose, throat, and fecal discharges of infected persons," according to a coxsackie virus fact sheet from the Connecticut Department of Public Health.

Who gets coxsackie virus?
-------------------------
Anyone can be infected, but the disease seems to occur predominately in children under 10 years of age.

When can a person spread the virus to others?
---------------------------------------------
A person may spread the virus to others just prior to the onset of symptoms, during the acute stage of illness and perhaps longer, since this virus may persist in the stool for several weeks. The incubation period is usually 3 to 5 days.

What are the symptoms and when do they appear?
----------------------------------------------
Symptoms develop 3 to 5 days after exposure. Most children will complain of a sore throat or sore mouth and loss of appetite. Fever of 101-102 degF [approx. 38-39 degC] lasts 1-2 days and is usually accompanied by sores in the mouth. Sores can also occur on the hands and feet and occasionally on the buttocks. The illness is mild and lasts 1 week or less.

What is the treatment?
----------------------
At this time, there is no specific treatment.

What can be done to prevent the spread of this disease?
-------------------------------------------------------
Particular attention should be paid to hand washing and personal hygiene.
