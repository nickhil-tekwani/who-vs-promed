Rising bird deaths in Argyle park a mystery
-------------------------------------------
Dead birds began showing up around Argyle Lake [in Babylon, Long Island,
NY] about 2 weeks ago. A mallard here, a Canada goose there, even a swan.
Now the toll has reached more than 20, Babylon Village officials say.
Mayor Ralph Scordino said the village is not sure why the birds are dying.
The Suffolk County Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals said
that preliminary indications point toward avian botulism, a paralytic
disease produced by decaying matter such as old bread, which many people
continue to feed the ducks despite warning signs telling them not to.
The Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) has tested one duck
brought in by the village and is awaiting results to confirm whether
botulism was present, DEC spokeswoman Aphrodite Montalvo said.
In the meantime, park lovers and village officials are searching for
answers. People who frequent Argyle Lake began calling Scordino's office 2
weeks ago and reported seeing as many as 4 dead fowl a day, officials said.
Jane Stanford, of West Islip, said she saw 4 dead ducks as she walked
around the lake one evening 2 weeks ago. "People told me they were all over
the place and I thought something should be done," she said. "It's a shame
they're dying."
Matthew Wilson, 23, of Patchogue, said he noticed a dead mallard Tuesday [7
Aug 2007] on his lunch break. "It was pretty dead and it stunk pretty bad,"
he said.
Village officials said Argyle Lake has random waterfowl deaths throughout
the year, but they have not seen so many in such a short period. While
village officials reported 15 dead waterfowl over the past 2.5 weeks, a
village worker who regularly removes the dead birds but asked not to be
identified said he had counted about 2 dozen.
Village officials and parkgoers said some of the waterfowl that died later
were moving around in what looked like a drunken state, while others gasped
for air; the observers thought the birds were victims of children attacking
them with slingshots, something they say happens in the area. But SPCA
chief of department Roy Gross said, "There is no indication of foul play."
The speculation that botulism is the cause arose largely from those
symptoms. The bacteria that produces the botulism toxin can be found in
dead fish or other dead animals or old bread. Birds typically are
paralyzed, causing them to drown. The chances of humans contracting the
disease are slim, according to the DEC.
Animal experts and village officials said many people who visit the lake
ignore pleas to stop feeding the fowl. "There is bacteria that forms in the
water and the ducks will eat the snails or bread that gets full of
bacteria," Gross said. "Don't feed them; just let them be."
Officials said certain environmental conditions, such as intense heat and
lowered water levels, also increase bacteria. "We've had periodic problems
during the summer when it's really hot."

[This suspiciously sounds like botulism. Though avian botulism is seen more
often in other regions, it will occur where the conditions are favorable.
The sporulating anaerobic Gram positive bacillus _Clostridium botulinum_
elaborates 7 types of antigenically distinct neurotoxins, 4 of which affect
humans: type A, B, E, or rarely type F. Toxins types A and B are highly
poisonous proteins resistant to digestion by GI enzymes. About 50 per cent
of foodborne [botulism] outbreaks in the USA are caused by type A toxin,
followed by types B and E.
Type C botulism occurs principally in waterfowl and other birds living in
an aquatic environment and causes tremendous losses, most notably in
waterfowl in the western US. In addition to North America, it has been
reported in birds in Europe, South Africa, Uruguay, and Australia. In the
Great Lakes region, it was first identified in 1936 in ducks on Green Bay
of Lake Michigan and in 1941 in Monroe County marshes along Lake Erie. Type
C is most often associated with limberneck paralysis in birds.
_C. botulinum_ spores are relatively heat-resistant, though high
temperatures and/or exposure to moist heat will kill the spores.
Although botulism can be difficult to manage in a scenario such as this, it
is still important to pick up the dead birds. Maggots that grow in the
carcass with harbor the botulinum toxin and when other birds consume the
maggots, a new toxicity results. So picking up the dead birds can help
control the outbreak.
