The Wisconsin Department of Health Services (DHS) has confirmed the deaths of 3 children under the age of 18 due to complications from influenza. These are the first reported pediatric influenza-associated deaths in Wisconsin for the 2021-2022 season.

"DHS is deeply saddened to report these flu deaths in Wisconsin this influenza season," said state health officer Paula Tran. "It is important to remember that along with COVID-19, other communicable diseases such as flu are circulating in our communities. Each of these alone can pose serious health risks for children, and co-infection can occur. It is not too late for Wisconsinites to get vaccinated to protect themselves and others."

With the number of flu cases and hospital admissions rising throughout the state, DHS encourages Wisconsinites to get vaccinated. The flu vaccine is the best way to prevent severe illness associated with the influenza virus. Everyone over 6 months of age is recommended to get the flu vaccine. Specifically, it is highly recommended for people who are at greater risk of becoming seriously ill, such as those who are pregnant, over age 65, and those with chronic health conditions. DHS recommends Wisconsinites talk with a healthcare provider if they have questions about the flu or getting vaccinated. It is never too late to get a flu shot.

As COVID-19 continues to circulate across Wisconsin, staying up to date on COVID-19 vaccines also remains critical. You can get your flu and COVID-19 vaccines at the same time. Vaccine finder (https://www.vaccines.gov/) is a free tool that can help Wisconsinites find a vaccine provider near them.

In addition to getting vaccinated, taking everyday actions to stop the spread of germs can help prevent the flu and other respiratory illnesses:
- wash your hands often with soap and water;
- avoid touching your nose, eyes, and mouth;
- stay home and away from others if you feel sick;
- avoid being around others who are sick or have flu symptoms;
- cover your nose and mouth when you cough or sneeze and encourage children to do the same.

Up-to-date information on the current flu season can be found in the DHS Weekly Respiratory Report (https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/library/p-02346-2021-22.htm).

[ProMED thanks Elizabeth Goodsitt for sharing the relevant data on pediatric deaths associated with influenza over the last 5 seasons up to 2022. The data indicate that the figures are similar during the 2021-22 season.

The global influenza update no. 415 dated 21 Mar 2022, based on data up to 6 Mar 2022 (https://www.who.int/teams/global-influenza-programme/surveillance-and-monitoring/influenza-updates/current-influenza-update) includes the following statement: "In North America, influenza activity increased in recent weeks but remained lower than pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels at this time of the year and was predominantly due to influenza A viruses, with A(H3N2) predominant among the subtyped viruses." - Mod.SH

This supports the relevant seasonal update shared for Wisconsin state as well. - Mod.UBA

Since large parts of Danish society were shut down on 12 Mar 2020 due to COVID-19, the incidence of influenza has been at a very low level until the beginning of 2022. Now the number of people infected with influenza A is doubling from week to week.

In Denmark, the incidence of influenza tends to increase at the end of December. But this season, the flu has started very late, after being almost completely absent for the last 2 years during COVID-19. Currently, however, there is a steep increase in the number of flu cases in most of the country. In recent weeks, the number of infected has thus doubled from week to week and in week 10 reached 1179 infected.

A total of 2533 cases of influenza have been detected this season. The vast majority of cases -- a total of 2459 -- are caused by the type of influenza virus called A/H3N2. It is a well-known flu type, which is also circulating in other countries. H3N2 is included in the seasonal vaccine, but it is known to change and this may reduce the effect of the vaccine. This season, changes have been seen in the H3N2 viruses in circulation, which may mean that the vaccine has a reduced effect.

Influenza has been detected in all age groups. At present, however, a predominance of children and the younger part of the population aged 15-44 as well as people over 85 years of age are affected by influenza.

It is now more than 5 months since seasonal flu vaccines became available. The late onset of influenza prevalence is therefore a challenge, as the effect of vaccines decreases over time.

In the age group 2-6 years, the effect of the influenza vaccine, which is targeted at children, is calculated at 71% against influenza A. In the age group 7-44 years, the effect is calculated at 43%, while in the age group 45 years and over, no effect against the circulating influenza A type. "Despite the fact that the vaccine effectiveness against influenza infection is not measurable in the age group 45 and above, the vaccine will probably still have some effect against serious illness if you become infected with influenza," says section leader Ramon Trebbien from Stans Serum Institut (SSI).

It is not so surprising that the best effect of the flu vaccine is seen among the children, as children generally have a good ability to form antibodies after being vaccinated. In addition, vaccinated children aged 2-6 years have received 2 doses of the live attenuated childhood vaccine, which was introduced in the Danish vaccination program for the influenza season 2021/22.

[The influenza activity update on Europe for the week 14 Mar-20 Mar 2022 (https://flunewseurope.org/) states: "For week 11, 2022, of 42 countries and areas reporting on intensity of influenza activity, 19 reported baseline-intensity (across the Region), 15 reported low-intensity (across the Region), 6 reported medium-intensity (Belgium, Denmark, Estonia, France, Georgia and Kazakhstan) and 2 reported high-intensity (Bulgaria and Luxembourg).

- The percentage of all sentinel primary care specimens from patients presenting with influenza-like illness or acute respiratory infection symptoms that tested positive for an influenza virus rose from week 4, 2022 until week 10, 2022 (when it reached 27%) but declined slightly, to 20%, in week 11, 2022.
- Both influenza type A and type B viruses were detected, with A(H3) viruses being dominant across all monitoring systems.
- A(H3) viruses were most frequently detected in patients hospitalized with confirmed influenza virus infection."

Based on above report, it appears that there has been medium-intensity influenza activity in some countries, including Denmark, mainly on account of influenza A/H3N2, and effectiveness of the seasonal influenza vaccine may have been affected by the virus evolution. - Mod.UBA
