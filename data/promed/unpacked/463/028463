Anthrax resurfaced in the agency area of Visakhapatnam on Saturday [26 Sep 2015] where at least 6 people were detected with symptoms. The district medical and health authorities said that all of the patients have been shifted to King George Hospital in Visakhapatnam for diagnosis and treatment besides making efforts to contain the disease.

According to the officials, 6 tribals from Thadiputtu, Boddaputtu, Nimmalapadu and Urrada villages in Hukumpeta mandal have been suffering with a skin allergy for the past week. Initially, they found dark spots on their hands and legs, which started spreading over the last 7 days. Panicked over this, one of these patients approached the local government doctor who in turn visited the tribal villages on Saturday [26 Sep 2015] and found that 6 people were suffering with the symptoms of anthrax. The patients were immediately shifted to KGH for diagnosis and treatment.

To ensure that the deadly disease does not spread in the agency area, the district medical and health officials conducted a medical camp and are conducting preliminary investigations to identify more such cases, if any. The doctors suspect that the disease might have spread due to the people eating semi-cooked meat or due to drinking unsafe water collected from streams which may contain dead animal matter.

Speaking to Express, DMHO J Sarojini said that a 5-member medical team is camping in Hukumpeta area to conduct screening tests for the tribals suffering with anthrax symptoms. She suspected that the disease could be skin-related anthrax, and necessary screening tests will be conducted on Mon 28 Sep 2015 for providing further treatment. "We are equipped to deal with skin-related anthrax, but respiratory and intestine related cases would be difficult to deal with. However, we will determine the cause of the skin disease on Monday [28 Sep 2015] after further diagnostic tests and provide necessary treatment," she added.

The Medical and Health Department has also alerted the Animal Husbandry Department on the issue. A special team has been formed to determine whether the disease is indeed anthrax and its point of origin. The team has visited the agency areas in Hukumpeta mandal and collected necessary evidence, which will be tested over the next couple of weeks. This would not only help the authorities contain the disease to a certain area but also help them in treating it.

[To date, all there is is a clinical diagnosis of (cutaneous) anthrax. It has yet to be laboratory confirmed. A veterinary team from the Animal Husbandry Department is in the area checking for animal cases. For myself, I expect them to come up with a clearer result, as humans have a bad habit of self-treating with antibiotics, which rapidly kill the vegetative cells of _Bacillus anthracis_, before seeking medical help.

Six people spread across 4 villages suggest that at least 3 of them got infected from market-bought meat. And secondly, if it is anthrax, there are other cases awaiting identification.

To find Andhra Pradesh, go to http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm and https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=3679190,48045. It is in south east India. For Vizag and Visakhapatnam, go to http://www.fallingrain.com/world/IN/02/Vishakhapatnam.html and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visakhapatnam. To locate the villages noted in this report (Thadiputtu, Boddaputtu, Nimmalapadu and Urrada) go to http://www.onefivenine.com/india/villag/Visakhapatanam/Hukumpeta. - Mod.MHJ
