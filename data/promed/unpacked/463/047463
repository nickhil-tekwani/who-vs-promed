CONTAMINATED BEACHES, WARNING (02)

[see
Contaminated beaches, warning 970703144142]
[After posting a news item about National Resource Defense Council's [NRDC]
warnings about risk of illness at eastern US beaches, I received the
following email, which elaborates on the problem. -- RAL]
"I have been trying to get someone at the NRDF to look at some new studies.
We have found that swimming in waters that currently meet USEPA [U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency] criteria can cause gastroenteritis, acute
febrile respiratory illness, and ear problems.
We conducted 4 randomized trials, the results of which were published
in the Lancet and the AJPH [American Journal of Public Health] (non-enteric
illnesses). We are in the process of publishing estimates of severity and
have a method to calculated overall disease burden at any beach. We are
talking about an average illness period of 3 to 4 or 5 days, depending on
symptoms, and about 20% of our volunteers needing to visit a physician.
I am contacted about once a year by [name deleted -- Mod CHC], or [by] an
intern, but nothing ever comes of it.
We have the data to prove illness is occurring, USEPA criteria are not
epidemiologically sound, [we] can predict illness burdens, [make] estimates
of illness severity, and [have] enough evidence to challenge the USEPA and
the [individual] States.
The WHO is in the process of adopting our work to be used as recommended
criteria, the EC [European Community] is taking a hard look at our data,
while the US does nothing.
Both [our studies] were randomized trials. I can give you about a dozen more
that Dr. Kay and I published. We are submitting a paper on severity of the
illnesses we found this week. I cannot go public with the results, but I can
say we are talking about an average of 3-5 days of lost daily activities
among about 10% to 20% of those becomming ill, depending on the illness.
These numbers add up to an enormous disease burden when multipled by the
number of bathers going into marine waters each year.

[Personally, I did not care for the tone of this message. I believe it was
meant for Dr. LaBudde but he sent it to ProMED-mail for posting, so I am
posting it. I had to make numerous grammatical and other alterations, and am
hopeful I did not change the meaning too much. I haven't been on a beach
since I saw "Jaws", so I am not too worried about this but it seems to me
that a more direct approach and calmer tone with USEPA might prove more
helpful and enlightening. Perhaps another Moderator would be willing to
continue this string, I won't. -- Mod CHC]
