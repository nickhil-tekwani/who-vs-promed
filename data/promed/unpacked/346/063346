Noted skin specialist and Karachi Institute of Skin Diseases Director Dr. Iqbal Nabi Soomro on Wednesday [23 Jan 2019] said that a rare skin disease -- leishmaniasis -- is rising to an epidemic level in the Sindh-Balochistan border areas while no vaccine is available for the treatment of patients.

Talking to PPI, Dr. Iqbal Nabi Soomro said leishmaniasis cases have been reported from Dadu, Larkana, Winder and other hilly areas of Sindh and Balochistan provinces for the past several weeks. He said leishmaniasis is transmitted by a sandfly that bites and injects the germs into the body of victims.

He explained that the sandfly stings exposed parts of the human body. These flies are more active during the morning and evening, and a small leishmaniasis skin infection or wound can become lethal if not properly managed.

He said leishmaniasis vaccines are not available all over Pakistan for treatment to this skin problem. He said the World Health Organisation (WHO) has added the leishmaniasis vaccine to the essential life-saving drug category, but unfortunately these vaccines are not available in the local market.

Dr. Soomro said that all kind of diagnostic and consultation facilities are available at the Institute of Skin Diseases, Karachi, free of cost, but vaccines are not available in Pakistan for leishmaniasis patients nor are they being imported from other countries for the management of skin diseases.

Another skin specialist, Dr. Qamar Iqbal Chandio, said the disease affects people all over the world, particularly in Africa, Central and South America, Asia and other countries. He said the major reason for this current epidemic was the free movement of people from Afghanistan to Pakistan, and this interaction had resulted in the free mixing of people and provided the chance of transmission of the disease.

He advised people to report cases immediately to the nearest hospital; use mates, coils and creams to repel the sandfly; keep wounds clean and well dressed, use the sandfly bed nets; cover exposed parts of the body at night; and spray insecticide in and around the houses to avoid this skin problem.

A team from WHO visited the Karachi Institute of Skin Diseases to assess the overall situation and discussed vector control strategies. The team will also visit Sindh and Balochistan border areas for a comprehensive assessment of the situation.

According to WHO, an estimated 700 000 to one million new cases of leishmaniasis and 20 000 to 30 000 deaths are reported from it all over the world annually.

[The text confuses treatment with vaccines. No vaccine against leishmaniasis exists anywhere in the world. Treatment depends on drugs like amphotericin B, miltefosine, the pentavalent antimonials -- meglumine antimoniate (Glucantim) and sodium stibogluconate (Pentostam) -- and pentamidine. However, control programs limiting the transmission by the sandfly from the rodent reservoir to humans are important. - Mod.EP
