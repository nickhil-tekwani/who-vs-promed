First Report of Brown Rot in Wine Grapes Caused by _Monilinia
fructicola_ in Canada.

Plant Dis. 87:1268, 2003; published on-line as D-2003- 0808-03N,
2003. Accepted for publication 30 Jul 2003.
A survey was conducted in 2001 and 2002 to determine incidence of
fruit pathogens in wine grapes (_Vitis vinifera_), an important crop
in the southern interior of British Columbia (BC), Canada. Grape
clusters were sampled every 2 weeks from June to October at 8
vineyard sites located from Osoyoos in the south to Kelowna,
approximately 100 km to the north.
In the laboratory, the berry clusters were surface disinfested for
0.5 min in 70 percent ethanol, followed by 1 min in 0.5 percent
sodium hypochlorite, and rinsed twice in sterile distilled water. The
berries were placed on potato dextrose agar (PDA) amended with 15
ml/liter of 85 percent lactic acid and incubated at 20 deg C for 1
week.
During the 2002 survey, a fungus resembling _Monilinia fructicola_
(G. Wint.) Honey was observed sporulating on immature 'Pinot noir'
grapes from Kelowna that were sampled on 14 Aug 2002. Later in the
growing season, a similar fungus was detected on 'Riesling' grapes
from Summerland sampled on 11 Sep. There was no evidence of brown rot
near the vineyard in Kelowna, but diseased stonefruit were present
near the vineyard in Summerland.
Subsequent identification of the fungus from 'Riesling' as _M.
fructicola_ was based on morphological characters and DNA sequence
data for the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions of the nuclear
ribosomal rRNA genes. The sequenced isolate was deposited in the
Canadian Collection of Fungus Cultures as DAOM 231119, and the ITS
sequence was accessioned in GenBank as AY289185.
Colony growth on PDA was rapid and in concentric rings with the
colony margin complete, microconidia abundant, and macroconidia 12 to
13 micrometers long. Macroconidia germinated with a long germ tube
before branching. These characteristics distinguished this fungus
from _M. laxa_, a closely related species that is slow-growing with
lobed colony margins, produces few microconidia, and germ tubes that
branch close to the conidium (1). The complete ITS sequence for DAOM
231119 was a 100 percent match to other sequences deposited for _M.
fructicola_ (Z73777, AF010500, and U21815).
On the basis of comparisons of available data, ITS sequences for _M.
fructicola_ (3 complete ITS, 7 partial ITS) and _M. laxa_ (8 complete
ITS, 10 partial ITS) differed consistently at 4 nucleotide positions.
The fungus identified as _M. fructicola_ was tested for pathogenicity
on mature surface-sterilized 'Pinot noir' and 'Riesling' grapes.
Under humid conditions, buff-colored sporodochia bearing conidia
developed over the surface of the infected berries. This indicates
that _M. fructicola_ can cause decay of wine grapes and could be
confused with bunch rot caused by _Botrytis cinerea_. Previously, _M.
fructicola_ was reported on grapes in Oklahoma, but likely these
grapes were not _Vitis vinifera_ (2).
To our knowledge, this is the first report of brown rot caused by _M.
fructicola_ on wine grapes in North America.

[This piece is essentially to report the first occurrence of
_Monilinia fructicola_ [Mf] on wine grapes in Canada. It is a major
pathogen on stone fruits (peaches, cherries, plums, prunes,
nectarines, and apricots) and, depending on weather conditions, can
cause extensive crop losses. Do any of our readers have information
about Mf infecting wine grapes in other regions of the world? Please
let me know. - Mod.DH]
