E. coli infects 9 children
--------------------------
Nine children have been diagnosed with the potentially fatal _Escherichia
coli_ O157 infection at a nursery in Antrim, Northern Ireland [County
Antrim is located in the north of Northern Ireland - Mod.LL]. The infection
is a serious form of food poisoning that has a range of symptoms including
vomiting and diarrhea [the latter often containing blood - Mod.LL]. Laura's
Lodge Day Nursery closed voluntarily on Thu 11 Sep 2003 following advice
from environmental health officers and the Northern Health Board. Earlier
that day, 2 children had been sick, and the previous week another child was
found to have _E. coli_ O157.
60 children and staff are being screened for the illness, and the Northern
Health Board is running further checks on children who had initially tested
negative. The board confirmed on Mon 15 Sep 2003 9 children at the creche
[in this context, "creche" is used to describe a day nursery. The word is
derived from Old French _cresche_, meaning crib - Mod.LL] were now
infected, and that finding the source of the outbreak was its main objective.
Michael Devine, consultant in communicable diseases at the Northern Health
Board, said this type of infection -- _E. coli_ O157 -- was often passed on
from cattle. "It has the potential to be a serious infection," he said.
"The primary source of the infection is from cattle, then people acquire
the infection, either through direct contact with the animals or through
the food chain, and it also readily passes from person to person."
The number of cases in the UK has tripled in the last decade, jumping from
361 cases in 1991 to over 1000 cases in 1997. About 15 per cent of cattle
are now thought to carry it in their gut.
Mr Devine added: "I don't want to cause undue alarm, but we must be fair to
people and point out that this is potentially life threatening and must be
taken very seriously. This is a serious situation, but one we're responding
to with all haste."

[The epidemiology of this outbreak in a day care center is unclear at this
point. Rather than the cluster being due to a common food at the center, it
is possible that one child (who may have acquired it from undercooked beef,
a petting zoo, or elsewhere) brought it into the center, where the _E.
coli_ spread from child to child.
A recent issue of JAMA (10 Sep 2003) contained 2 original articles and an
editorial relating to one of the complications of infection with this
organism, that of hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS). The first paper reported
that a multicenter study using oral therapy with a Shiga toxin-binding
agent (containing globotriaosylceramide) did not diminish the severity of
HUS (1). The second study found that death or end stage renal disease
occurred in about 12 per cent of patients with _E. coli_-associated HUS,
and 25 per cent of survivors had long term kidney disease as a sequel (2).
The reader should also be reminded that _E. coli_ strains other than O157
may also produce this disease (see: ProMED-mail. E. coli, VTEC non-O157 -
UK (Scotland) 20030825.2144).
