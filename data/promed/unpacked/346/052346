A 6th person has died from a _Listeria_ infection after eating NHS sandwiches, Public Health England (PHE) has confirmed, as they continue to investigate whether more people have died at dozens of trusts.

In June [2019], public health officials said 5 seriously ill patients had died, and 9 more infected, after eating food, which contained the deadly bacteria _Listeria_.

On [Thu 1 Aug 2019] they confirmed that 1 of the 9 patients infected has now died.

PHE said it was continuing to test all samples of _Listeria_ on an ongoing basis to check if they are linked to this outbreak.

"Our investigations continue and the public should be reassured that the risk continues to be low," PHE said in a statement released.

[In June 2019 ProMED-mail posted a report of the deaths of 3 hospitalized patients in Manchester and Liverpool among a total of 6 patients affected in England in a _Listeria_ outbreak linked to pre-packed meat sandwiches that were served at the hospitals. The meat had tested positive for the outbreak strain of _Listeria_, presumably on the basis of matching genotypes, and the meat sandwiches linked to the outbreak were said to have been "withdrawn" at the time. See ProMED-mail post Listeriosis - Europe (04): (UK) nosocomial, fatal, meat sandwiches 20190608.6510327.

The nosocomial _Listeria_ outbreak reported in the news article above is likely the same as the June 2019 nosocomial _Listeria_ outbreak. The appearance of new cases more than one month after recall of the implicated food can be attributed to the long incubation period of listeriosis of up to 70 days. We are told that there are now 6 deaths from a _Listeria_ infection after eating National Health Service (NHS) sandwiches among a total of 14 affected patients.

In the USA and Europe, clusters of related cases are identified based on clinical isolates of _L. monocytogenes_, usually from blood, cerebrospinal fluid, tissue from a normally sterile site, or products of conception (such as amniotic fluid and placental or fetal tissue) having similar genotypes. Food is confirmed to be the source if _Listeria_ isolated from it has a genotype that matches the genotype of the clinical outbreak strain.

Refrigerated ready-to-eat smoked salmon and cold cut meats, that is, food that is not cooked before eating, are well-recognized sources for listeriosis. Even if initial contamination adds only a few _Listeria_ organisms to the food, the contamination can be significant for refrigerated foods because _L. monocytogenes_ can subsequently multiply at refrigerator temperatures to sufficient number to cause disease. Unpasteurized milk and cheese and other milk products made from unpasteurized milk are other sources of listeriosis. These types of food should not be served to hospitalized patients who are likely to be at increased risk for listeriosis, such as pregnant women (and their newborns), adults aged 65 years or older, and people with weakened immune systems. - Mod.ML
