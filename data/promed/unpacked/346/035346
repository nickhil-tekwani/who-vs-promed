Nigerian polio outbreak hits new heights, threatens region
----------------------------------------------------------
Nigeria's fast-growing polio outbreak now accounts for more than three
quarters of the world's fresh cases of the crippling disease and threatens
children across West Africa, health officials said.
The World Health Organization (WHO) said that, by 23 Jun 2004, it had
confirmed 257 new victims of polio in Nigeria -- where some Islamic leaders
are opposed to a bid to eradicate the virus through vaccination -- and that
the new figure represents 77 per cent of known cases worldwide.
"Unfortunately, those are our figures," said Mohamed Belhocine, the WHO's
representative in Nigeria, citing the outbreak, centered on the northern
Nigerian city of Kano, as a cause of major concern to the international
health care coalition battling to stamp out polio by the end of 2004. "We
pay concern to the resumption of vaccination in Kano, because it is the
only way to have protection for all children. It is from there that
contamination spread to other children, and it is because of that [that] we
have new polio cases," he told AFP by telephone.
In March 2004, Nigeria saw the "highest ever-recorded" monthly incidence of
wild polio virus, with 85 confirmed cases across the country, a WHO
statement said.
As of April 2004, only 6 of the 36 states in Africa's most populous country
-- the mainly-Christian southern states of Abia, Adamawa, Ebonyi, Edo, and
Rivers, and the central state of Nasarawa -- were polio-free, the statement
said, warning of worse to come as Nigeria's annual rains intensify.
"Intense transmission of the polio disease in Nigeria continues despite the
low transmission season. High transmission season of polio occurs during
rainy season when children get contact with contaminated water and food,"
it said. Nigeria's rains begin in March and build up in August and September.
According to the United Nations children's fund (UNICEF) spokesman in
Nigeria, Gerrit Beger, there have been 44 new cases of polio in West Africa
outside Nigeria since 2003, when officials, in parts of Muslim northern
Nigeria, began refusing to administer oral polio vaccine to children.
According to experts, for each confirmed polio case, there are between 200
and 300 children under 3 years old carrying the virus. [The paralytic to
non-paralytic ratio ranges from a high of 1/50 infected to a low of 1/1000
infected - Mod.MPP] "The number of cases is increasing. That is what we
believe, and, certainly, this situation worries us," said Beger.
In March 2004, Kano's state government refused to take part in a United
Nations-led campaign to vaccinate West African children against polio,
following a campaign by Islamic clerics against the vaccine in use. Some
local preachers alleged that the vaccine had been laced with fertility
hormones by western agents as part of a US-led bid to sterilize African
girls. International health experts dismissed the claims.
Kano suspended vaccination, saying that it preferred to import "safe"
vaccines produced in an Islamic country. On 27 May 2004, Kano said that it
was testing polio vaccines made in Indonesia, and was waiting for the results.
"Progress is being made in negotiations with the state of Kano. We are in
constant touch with Kano and the Federal Ministry of Health," Belhocine
said. "There are indications that lead us to think that vaccination could
resume next month in July," he said.
Kano state spokesman, Sule Ya'u Sule, said that such a return to
vaccination was a "possibility", but added that the government was still
waiting for the outcome of the test on the Indonesian vaccines. "As soon as
we find the result positive, we will begin the exercise," he said.

[In the 22 Jun 2004 ProMED-mail posting on the polio case in Darfur, Sudan,
showing genetic sequencing of the virus isolated to be consistent with an
origin in Nigeria, the official figures for the number of polio cases in
Nigeria in 2004 was 197. The polio eradication program statistics for the
week of 22 Jun 2004 report the above given number of 257 cases of polio in
Nigeria in 2004 to date. <http://www.polioeradication.org/casecount.asp>
Globally, as of the week of 22 Jun 2004, 333 cases of polio were reported
worldwide, with the above mentioned 257 cases in Nigeria (77.2 per cent of
the global reports), 18 cases in Niger (5.4 per cent), 15 cases in Pakistan
(4.5 per cent), 13 cases in India (3.9 per cent), 3 cases in Afghanistan (1
per cent), and 1 case in Egypt (0.3 per cent). These 6 countries are those
countries where polio is considered to be endemic (wild poliovirus
transmission has not been interrupted) and account for 307 of the 333
reported cases in 2004 (92.2 per cent of the reported cases globally). Of
the remaining 26 reported cases, all are from countries in Africa and are
related to the ongoing outbreak in Nigeria. (1 is from the Central African
Republic, 4 are from Burkina Faso, 4 are from Benin, 8 are from Cote
d'Ivoire, 7 are from Chad, 1 is from Botswana, and 1 is from Sudan).

While ProMED-mail was "slow" in reporting this ongoing situation in Africa
(the 1st report was 21 Mar 2004), we are dismayed at the slowness of
response of the community in Northern Nigeria, specifically in Kano State,
the epicenter of this outbreak to interrupting transmission. - Mod.MPP]
