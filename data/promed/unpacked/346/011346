A recent outbreak of pseudorabies virus (PRV) infection in south western
Minnesota has led to tighter scrutiny of herds throughout southern
Minnesota and northern Iowa. Joining the rest of the state, 10 Minnesota
counties bordering Iowa were upgraded to stage IV PRV eradication.
Currently federal and state classification of pseudorabies in stages I to V
is based on slaughter checks, on-farm testing, and confirmation of
pseudorabies outbreaks. A state in stage IV has no known PRV infection and
no new cases confirmed within one year of application.
Despite the outbreak, the risk of PRV infection in southern Minnesota still
remains low, says Dr Paul Anderson, director of the Minnesota Board of
Animal Health Swine Division. As a safeguard, local veterinarians continue
to encourage vaccination of breeding herds. It's an important insurance
program against big potential losses from PRV, notes Dr Rick Sibbel, a
swine veterinarian.
"Veterinarians and producers need to keep apprised of the pseudorabies
situation in their area even as we work toward PRV-free status in the
United States," says Sibbel. "It will be 2 to 3 years without a case of
pseudorabies before there is a real lack of risk from the disease to swine
herds."

[Pseudorabies is a disease of swine that can also affect cattle, horses,
dogs, cats, sheep, and goats. The disease is caused by pseudorabies virus
(PRV), an extremely contagious herpesvirus that causes reproductive
problems, including abortion, stillbirths, and even occasional death losses
in breeding and finishing hogs. The virus has never been shown to be
contagious to humans, not even to people working on farms with many PRV
infected animals.
PRV is primarily spread through direct animal to animal contact between an
infected and shedding pig and a noninfected pig. If present on inanimate
objects, such as boots, clothing, feed, trucks, and equipment, the virus
can also spread from herd to herd and farm to farm. Hence prevention is
through sanitation and strict biosecurity. - Mod.TG]
