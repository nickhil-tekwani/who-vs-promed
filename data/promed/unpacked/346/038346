[The HPAI H5N6 virus, has been detected in poultry in China, Laos, and Viet Nam since its initial emergence in 2014 as a reassortant of H5N1 and H6N6. There have been a total of 9 human cases since its recognition, 4 of which reported since 29 Dec 2015 in Guangdong province.

As reported by Mod.LK (archive no. 20160118.3946852), China's authorities have issued, in response to the recent upsurge in human cases, a press release reassuring the public that there is no evidence of human-to-human transmission of HPAI H5N6 (http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2016-01/15/c_135013921.htm).

The HPAI H5N6 outbreak in black swans and peacocks, described in the media report above, has been reported to the OIE in follow-up report no. 11, submitted 18 Jan 2016. It included the following statistics:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Birds / 1297 / 165 / 91 / 1132 / 0
The report, with an interactive map, is available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?reportid=19542.

Since its initial notification in 2014, HPAI H5N6 has been the subject of 12 follow-up reports, the most recent one, submitted on 22 Jan 2016, reporting "no additional outbreaks". The updated summary of all reports since 2014, as presented in OIE's WAHID archive, is the following:
Total outbreaks = 32 (submitted)
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Birds / 230 805 / 32 824 / 24 087 / 206 644 / 0

China applies a stamping-out policy without vaccination for the handling of all HPAI strains in poultry; domestic, farmed swans, and peacocks are included among the animal species termed, according to OIE's criteria, as "poultry". - Mod.AS
