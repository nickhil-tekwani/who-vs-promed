Floods that devastated northern Namibia in February and March 2009 led
to higher food prices and a increase in animal diseases, the United
Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization [FAO] said.

About 6000 cattle remain trapped on isolated islands, where crocodiles
are "preying on the trapped cattle on a daily basis," the organization
said.

The floods caused an "unprecedented" outbreak of lumpy skin disease
[LSD] in cattle, with 6876 animals reported with the disease, against
the annual average of 200 cases, the FAO said.

"Lumpy skin disease causes high deaths in young animals and reduces
fertility, draught power, and the market value of animals," the report
said. "Although the government intervened in controlling the LSD
outbreak, the assistance came too late and had limited impact."

[LSD, ("neethling" or "knopvelsiekte"), is a vector-borne infectious
disease of cattle, caused by a capripoxvirus. The principal method of
LSD transmission is mechanical by arthropod vector.

The severity of disease depends on the strain of the virus and the
breed of host. _Bos taurus_ (such as European dairy cattle breeds) is
more susceptible to clinical disease than _Bos indicus_ (such as Zebu
beef cattle); the Asian buffalo has also been reported to be
susceptible. Disease can be prevented by vaccination; the continuous
spread of disease in northern Namibia may be indicative of deficient
vaccination coverage.

For a detailed overview on LSD, refer to the commentary in
20080131.0388. - Mod.AS]

[According to the OIE Animal diseases data on LSD "Transmission may
occur via infected saliva in the absence of an insect vector. Though
no specific vector has been identified to date, mosquitoes (e.g.
_Culex mirificens_ and _Aedes natrionus_) and flies (e.g. _Stomoxys
calcitrans_ and _Biomyia fasciata_) could play a major role."
