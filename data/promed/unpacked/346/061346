Chikungunya [virus] continues to spread in the province, with 694
confirmed cases in the island's official records. And the actual
figure is probably far higher. Phuket Provincial Health Office (PPHO)
director Dr Pongsawas Ratanasang confirmed that 669 Thais have
received hospital treatment for the disease. Dr Pongsawas said a
further 25 cases, all foreigners, have also been treated: 17 Burmese,
one Korean, one New Zealander, 2 Austrians, one Filipino, 2 Swedes,
and one Scot.

Thalang District is the highest risk area, followed by Kathu District
and Phuket City.

Dr Pongsawas stressed that nobody has yet died of the disease. He
expressed confidence the PPHO was succeeding in controlling its
spread. "The spread of the disease in Phuket is slowing down. I think
we can have it under control within 3 months," Dr Pongsawas said.

Dr Pongsawas said the actual number of cases was probably far higher,
as many people with the disease treat themselves or visit clinics.
One woman in Thalang complained to a local cable television channel
that despite frequent spraying of her home by authorities, every
member of her household had been [infected].

A Gazette staffer, who is still recovering from the disease, said,
"It's a nasty, debilitating, uncomfortable, and expensive fever to
have. My 1st symptom was an extremely high fever that topped 40 [deg
C/104 deg F], followed by severe aching in my knees and lower back,
as well as vomiting. I was admitted to hospital, put on a drip, and
pumped full of pain medication for 2 days.

"3 weeks on I still have pains in my lower back and knees, and have
been told by my doctor this could last another month. My bill topped
16 000 [USD 471] baht at the international hospital where I stayed
for 2 days," said the Scotsman.

[This report indicates that chikungunya virus transmission continues
in southern Thailand. This report raises important points. Adulticide
spraying for mosquito vectors, as indicated by the woman quoted
above, without larvicide treatment or elimination of breeding sites,
provides only short-term control. Several foreigners were infected,
and potentially could carry the virus back to their home countries if
viremic on arrival. If there are competent vectors in the home
countries, there is the risk of initiating outbreaks in new, distant
areas.
