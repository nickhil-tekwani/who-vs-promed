[ProMED-mail does not report every outbreak of salmonellosis that comes to
our attention. This report is posted a with a delay of several days because
it could be related to the bean sprout recall cited above. - Mod.ES

An outbreak of _Salmonella enteritidis_ [infection, an illness that can be
life threatening to children and the elderly, has prompted Colorado health
officials to call the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to
help track down the cause.
State epidemiologist Dr. Richard Hoffman said 35 people in Colorado have
come down with the illness in April, compared to an average of five per
month. Southern California and Nevada also have reported an increase in
cases, he said.
_Salmonella enteritidis_, also the name of the bacteria that causes the
illness, is a source of food poisoning that can result in diarrhea, fever
and abdominal cramps.
"The state laboratory has done DNA tests on 21 of the 35 specimens, and 16
of them are from one particular pattern," Hoffman said.
Officials will focus on the cases with similar "DNA fingerprints" to
determine the outbreak's source, which could include fruit, vegetables,
poultry, eggs, dairy, beef or other people, Hoffman said. Hoffman said the
most likely source is a commercial food product because the outbreak
includes several states.
The number of cases in Colorado could jump significantly because 18 more
_Salmonella_ incidents were reported Tuesday, Hoffman said.

[We will be interested to learn of the DNA fingerprinting data to see if
the strains of _S. enteritidis_ from the bean sprouts (reference cited
above) match the strain that predominates in the Denver outbreak. - Mod.ES
