MAFF RECRUITS VACCINATION TEAMS.
------------------------------------------------
The foot and mouth disease (FMD) epidemic continued to spread into
previously uninfected areas yesterday. A private company has been asked by
the Ministry of Agriculture to train hundreds of people in Scotland to
vaccinate animals. A team of people from the Scottish Agricultural College
(SAC) is recruiting up to 225 people. The first exercise has taken place in
Dumfries and Galloway, where there have been more than 130 outbreaks.
