It would be useful to know, from this sad story, what proportion of
children infected had clinical hepatitis; was it higher than 20
percent? If it was the same low rate as quoted [which includes
adults], there will be very many more children affected [theoretically
280].

Hopefully, all those who visited the clinic will be tested, and if
those who were injected with the same needle can be identified, it
should be possible to calculate the ratio of symptomatic to total
infected.

A total of 76 people, mostly children at or under the age of 10, have
been found infected with hepatitis C virus in a preliminary screening
in eastern Anhui province, local authorities said Wednesday [30 Nov
2011]. Of the total, 8 are receiving medical treatment at the county
people's hospital in Guoyang, the provincial health bureau said in a
statement. The hospital has screened more than 1000 local residents
since 17 Nov 2011, said Niu Chuanxi, head of the hospital's
examination department. A team of experts sent by the Ministry of
Health are currently investigating the outbreak.

Earlier, 56 people in Guoyang were reported to have tested positive
for hepatitis C virus in a preliminary screening, and further nucleic
acid tests on 16 confirmed 13 were infected. An initial investigation
by local health authorities showed all 56 once received intravenous
injections at a clinic in the nearby Maqiao township of Yongcheng city
in the neighboring Henan province, and the reuse of needles at a
village clinic might have caused the outbreak. A man in his 60s who
runs the village clinic in Maqiao is not a licensed doctor, the
Yongcheng city health bureau said Tuesday [29 Nov 2011].

A total of 104 people in Maqiao also have tested positive for
hepatitis C virus in a preliminary screening. Of all, 6 have been
confirmed as hepatitis C patients in further tests, the Yongcheng city
health bureau said. The bureau added that it is continuing to
investigate the role of the unlicensed doctor in Maqia outbreak.
