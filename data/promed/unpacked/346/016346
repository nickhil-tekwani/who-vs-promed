Dengue Fever Virus Type 4 Detected in Costa Rica
-------------------------------------------------
A total of 4 cases of dengue fever have been discovered in the Costa Rican
coastal city of Limon, health authorities confirmed here on Sat 30 Dec 2000.
Xiania Carvajal, Vice Minister of Health, noted that these are cases of
infection with dengue fever virus type 4, a [serotype not previously found
in Costa Rica. "In Costa Rica, there have been cases of infection with
dengue fever virus types 2 and 3, and some years ago, type 1, but never
type 4," she said. "We classify the infections as [less severe, that is,
less serious than with the other serotypes, but we will stay alert just the
same."
According to Carvajal, the 3 other types of dengue fever virus entered
Costa Rica via immigrants from other countries of Central America, where
all 4 types of dengue fever virus [exist. The disease reappeared in Costa
Rica in late 1993, and since then it has affected over 45 000 people.
Dengue viruses, carried by _Aedes_ mosquitoes, cause high fever and
headache, eye and muscle pain. There are 3 different patterns: classic
dengue, hemorrhagic dengue and shock syndrome, the gravest form of dengue
fever. Experts have found that once a person [experiences an infection with
any one type of dengue fever virus, he or she becomes immune to that
virus, but if he or she becomes [infected later by any other type, the
disease can become hemorrhagic.

Deaths in Limon, Costa Rica: Results of Tests Awaited
-----------------------------------------------------
LIMON: Although authorities of the Costa Rican Ministry of Health stated
that 2 recent deaths in Limon were not caused by dengue hemorrhagic fever,
Alvaro Duran, the Medical Director of the Tony Facio Hospital, said that
the laboratory results that would help to eliminate the possibility of
dengue hemorrhagic fever, or other virus [infections, were still pending.
Duran added that he suspects that the cases correspond to the same febrile
picture that, in past months, killed an eastern woman in the same province.
In this case he indicated tests were sent to a laboratory in the United
States, but results have not been received as yet.

[Dengue hemorrhagic fever deaths would not be unexpected following the
introduction of a dengue virus serotype not previously prevalent in a
population. The results of the laboratory tests are awaited with interest.
If the deaths are not attributed to dengue hemorrhagic fever, then what is
the diagnosis? - Mod.CP
