Massachusetts has its 3rd case of Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) this year [2020] -- a man in his 90s. According to the Massachusetts Department of Public Health, the man was exposed to EEE [virus] in Plymouth County. The state is now raising the threat level to critical in Halifax and high East Bridgewater and Hanson, all towns in Plymouth County. Across the state, 4 municipalities are at critical risk, 9 at high risk and 18 at moderate risk.

People are advised to use mosquito repellent when they are outside; those in high and critical risk communities are advised to avoid outdoor activities from dusk to dawn to reduce mosquito exposure.

The Halifax Board of Health is asking residents to refrain from activities from dusk to dawn at Vaughn Field, HOPS Playground, Holmes Street Playground, Holmes Street Beach and Boat Ramp, Summit Street Soccer Fields, Lingan Street Beach and the playing fields behind the elementary school.

EEE [virus] has been found in 64 mosquito samples this year [2020], more than 70% of them in species of mosquitoes capable of spreading the virus to people. For EEE updates, visit the state's webpage (https://www.mass.gov/guides/eee-in-massachusetts).

[EEE virus transmission is becoming more active in Massachusetts this year (2020). As noted earlier, the 1st human case of EEE appeared about 3 weeks after the virus was found in mosquitoes for the 1st time in 2020. This is the 2nd human case in Plymouth County and the 3rd human case in the state this year. The threat level has been raised to critical in 3 towns in the county. Last year (2019) was an unusually active year for EEE virus transmission in the eastern USA, with cases in humans and horses, including in Massachusetts. As mentioned in many previous ProMED-mail posts, horse owners in eastern and upper midwestern USA states should vaccinate their animals now if they have not done so already. There is no commercially available vaccine for humans, so avoidance of mosquito bites is the only preventive measure to take.

Additional information on EEE is available on the CDC website at https://www.cdc.gov/EasternEquineEncephalitis/. - Mod.TY
