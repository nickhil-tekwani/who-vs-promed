Indonesia: 4 year old boy a suspected avian influenza case
-------------------------------------------
A 4 year old boy has tested positive for avian influenza
virus infection in Indonesia, a case which, if confirmed,
would be the 6th in the world's 4th most populous country,
the health ministry said on Sun 9 Oct 2005. The boy from
Lampung province on Sumatra was found to be infected with
the deadly H5N1 avian influenza virus, director general of
Disease Control and Environmental Health I Nyoman Kandun
told Reuters. "Later, we will confirm the result in Hong
Kong. If the test result there is also positive, he will be
added to the list (of confirmed cases)," Kandun said. The
boy was in the hospital at Lampung. "He's well, only having
a cough," Kandun said.
4 Indonesians are already known to have died since July 2005
from the highly pathogenic H5N1 strain, which has killed 64
people in 4 Asian countries since late 2003 and has been
found in birds in Russia. [Outbreaks of avian influenza in
Romania and Turkey have been reported, but as of 9 Oct 2005,
the identity of the infectious agent has yet to be
confirmed. - Mod.CP]
6 other patients remain in a government-designated hospital
in Jakarta suspected of having avian flu. Indonesia's health
minister has said the country could face a bird flu epidemic
if the number of suspected cases of the virus continued to
mount. The government has put in place emergency measures to
stem the virus, including mandatory hospitalization of
anyone with suspicious symptoms.

[The number of confirmed cases (i.e. cases confirmed
positive by a WHO-designated reference laboratory in Hong
Kong) has been revised down to 3 fatal cases and 1 non-fatal
case. The Indonesian authorities believe that the above case
and another suspected case will be confirmed as avian H5N1
influenza virus positive, raising the number of confirmed
cases to 6. But another 80 to 90 cases have been identified
as suspected cases by the Indonesian authorities, but none
has been confirmed, and their present status is unknown. -
