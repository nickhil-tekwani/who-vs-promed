Equine Cases in Georgia Now Total 7
-----------------------------------
A total of 7 horses has now tested positive for West Nile virus, according
to the Georgia State Veterinarian. The latest 2 cases reside near the
Florida border in Lowndes and Berrien Counties and are recovering.
The sixth case was a 4-year-old mare presenting with limb weakness, high
stepping of the front limbs, and hypersensitivity to facial touch before
progressing to blindness and mild dementia. Following 2 weeks of
convalescent care, she has apparently recovered.
The seventh case, an 18-month-old Quarter Horse, had a history of falling
and presented with signs of colic. Other clinical signs included a
wide-based stance, head turn with bulging eye, rear limb weakness, abnormal
sweating patterns, behavioral changes, and hypersensitivity to facial
touch. The colt has since recovered.
There appears to be an adequate supply of West Nile virus vaccine, and
Georgia horse owners are encouraged to contact their veterinarians to
discuss possible vaccination protocols. According to Fort Dodge Animal
Health, over 25 000 doses of vaccine were distributed to Georgia
veterinarians during the month of August.
