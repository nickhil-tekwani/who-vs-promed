Scientists have discovered a virus carried by mosquitoes that could pave the way to eradicating mosquito-borne diseases such as Ross River virus, and potentially dengue fever. The virus, known as Parramatta River virus, was discovered in a joint research project by scientists at the University of Queensland (UQ) and the University of Sydney.

Dr Jody Hobson-Peters, from UQ's Australian Infectious Diseases Research Centre, said Parramatta River virus only infected mosquitoes and did not infect humans or animals. "We believe that if a mosquito is infected with this virus ... it may be harder for that mosquito to become infected with disease-causing viruses," she said. "(That means) we may be able to, in fact, stop disease transmission in its tracks."

Parramatta River virus belongs to the same family of viruses [flaviviruses] as dengue fever and, according to Dr Hobson-Peters, is transferred [transovarially] through generations of mosquitoes "very, very effectively." "This is very unusual for this type of virus, [and] we could, in fact, get lots of these mosquitoes infected with this virus," she said.

To date, researchers have only found Parramatta River virus in _Aedes vigilax_ mosquitoes, which are known to transmit Ross River virus. However, they are looking at the possibility that it or similar viruses are carried by the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito, responsible for transmitting dengue. "We're still doing a lot of virus discovery at the moment and have a brand new system to discover all of these brand new viruses," Dr Hobson-Peters said. "If we can prove that this type of virus, along with other viruses we're finding, does prevent mosquitoes being infected with dengue, perhaps in the future we may be able to stop it altogether."

Dr Hobson-Peters said researchers also were learning more about the types of microbes found inside mosquitoes. "We're only just scratching the surface on learning about what is in these mosquitoes," she said. "There's a lot of interaction between these microbes, and this (research) has never been done before. It's very exciting times."

[There is growing interest among medical entomologists and virologists in viruses that are restricted to mosquitoes. For example, there is increasing evidence of presence flaviviruses maintained in _Culex_ mosquitoes that transmit viruses of public health and animal health importance. If these mosquito viruses can reduce vector efficiency of the medically important viruses, or even block their transmission as the above report suggests, that would be an important finding and could be a useful approach for disease control.
