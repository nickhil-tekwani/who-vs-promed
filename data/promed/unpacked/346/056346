In reference to the recent posting regarding West Nile virus (WNV)
surveillance in the US, the following information might be useful.
Arbovirus surveillance efforts in north west Australia include serological
monitoring of sentinel chicken flocks for activity of the flaviviruses
Murray Valley encephalitis virus (MVE) and Kunjin (KUN). For this purpose
we developed a competitive ELISA using monoclonal antibodies to an
immunodominant epitope on the E protein of all flaviviruses (to screen for
general flavivirus infections), to an immunodominant epitope unique to the
NS1 protein of MVEV (to detect antibody specific to MVEV), and to an
immunodominant epitope unique the NS1 protein of KUN and WN viruses (to
detect antibody specific to KUNV - WNV does not circulate in Australia).
Using this ELISA system, we could reliably detect and differentiate KUNV
infections from MVEV infections in sentinel chickens, as well as in
laboratory rabbits and naturally infected humans (see Hall et al., 1995, J.
Virol. Methods, 51, 201-210). Although we have never tested antisera
against WNV in this assay, considering the close genetic and antigenic
relationship between WNV and KUNV (KUNV has recently been designated as a
subtype of WNV by the ICTV) and that the KUNV component of this assay
targets an epitope that is common to both KUN and WN viruses, it might be
worth evaluating for use in testing sentinel animal sera for WNV-specific
antibody. If anyone is interested I would be happy to provide them with the
monoclonals.
