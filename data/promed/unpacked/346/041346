Chinese workers poisoned by dumplings recalled after Japan outbreak
-------------------------------------------------------------------
China's food safety record took another hit, after a worker at a
state-run steelmaker in Hebei suffered food poisoning caused by
locally produced dumplings, which had been recalled following the
outbreak of food poisoning in Japan and resold, sources close to the case said.

The local authorities instructed state-run firms in Hebei to buy
gyoza dumplings produced and later recalled by Tianyang Food Plant in
order to bail out the firm, now in crisis following the food safety scandal.

The Japanese government has asked the Chinese government for details
about the incident, but Beijing has so far refused, pending a full
investigation.

About 150 000 packets of gyoza dumplings produced by Tianyang Food
Plant -- which were recalled after their pesticide-tainted gyoza
caused food poisoning in Japan -- were sold to state-owned companies
in Hebei Province between April and June last year [2008], according
to the sources.

One of the companies, Tangshan Iron and Steel Co., gave out tens of
thousands of packages to employees, who -- apparently due to scant
media coverage on the story in China -- ate the dumplings unaware of
the health risks. It was earlier learned that 4 employees of another
steelmaker suffered food poisoning in June last year [2008] after
eating frozen gyoza produced by Tianyang.

China denies serious food poisoning cases involving recalled dumplings
----------------------------------------------------------------------
No serious food poisoning cases have ever been reported after
employees of some Chinese companies who ate frozen dumplings recalled
by a company from Japan early last year [2008], company sources and
officials said Saturday [24 Jan 2009].

After investigation, a worker with Chengde Iron and Steel Company
showed discomfort after eating dumplings delivered by the company but
this man did not go to a hospital for diagnosis and was Ok after a
rest, said Zhang Jinying, a Hebei Provincial State-owned Assets
Supervision and Administration Commission.

Japan's Kyodo News reported Saturday [24 Jan 2009] that the frozen
dumplings, recalled after food poisoning cases involving them in
Japan, were delivered to a steel maker in Hebei Province and some
employees showed symptoms of food poisoning.

"Our company has never had food poisoning cases in connection with
staff's eating of the dumplings made by Tianyang Food Plant," Yu
Yong, general manger of Tangshan Iron and Steel Company in Hebei,
told Xinhua Saturday.

Some 20 companies in Hebei bought Tianyang Food's dumplings in April
last year [2008], after Tianyang Food recalled all its dumplings
exported to Japan in the wake of a poisoning accident. In January
last year, Japanese media reported that 10 people fell ill after
consuming frozen meat dumplings produced by Tianyang Food Plant based
in Hebei Province.

Japanese authorities found methamidophos in the vomit of those
poisoned and in food packages at their houses. But sample tests by
China quality watchdog showed that the rest of the same batch of
dumplings and other batches made at about the same time by the
Chinese company were safe, as were the raw materials used in
production. Zhang said Tianyang Food had been suspending production
since February last year.

[As a reminder, the implicated food mentioned in the above newswires,
gyoza (dumplings) had been recalled by the Japanese as having
resulted in a food poisoning incident in Japan, that when
investigated revealed pesticide contamination of the product. (see
prior ProMED-mail postings listed below. The above newswires have
contradictory information as to whether there was a food poisoning
incident in China associated with eating food that had been recalled
in Japan and returned to the production factory in
China. ProMED-mail would greatly appreciate clarification on the situation.
