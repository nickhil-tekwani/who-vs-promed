A virulent new strain of a common pig virus is wreaking havoc on Ontario
hog herds. Tens of thousands of hogs have been removed from farms by
deadstock companies this winter [2005-2006] and [in 2005]. They are victims
of a new strain of porcine circovirus or other illnesses that the
autoimmune disease brings on or makes worse.
Larry Skinner, chair of Ontario Pork's board, said province-wide mortality
rates are running at 10 to 12 per cent -- 5 to 6 times above the norm on
affected farms. On the hardest-hit farms, the figure is 40 to 50 per cent
or more and he sympathized with those struggling farmers. Meat packers are
also starting to worry about a pork shortage, he said.
Hog farmers are running up costs trying to treat the sick animals, losing
revenue when the hogs die and don't make it to market, and feeling the
emotional stress of seeing their animals suffer. At the same time, they
face market prices of 20 to 30 cents below the break-even mark of roughly
$1.50 per kilogram [USD 1.06].
Porcine circovirus, or PCVII, is not new; in fact, it's a common bug found
in pigs. But something happened to it 18 months ago: PCVII had previously
been confined to hogs aged 6 to 10 weeks, but it began showing up in hogs
aged 10 to 15 weeks and was resistant to traditional vaccines.
The circovirus epidemic was one of 3 major health problems to hit Ontario
hog farms in the past year and a half.
The winter of 2004-05 was the worst ever for porcine reproductive and
respiratory syndrome, or PRRS, a virus that causes pregnant sows to abort
fetuses. Soon after, the first signs of the more virulent strain of PCVII
surfaced. Ontario Pork was not able to provide an estimate of how many hogs
have died of it or from related causes.
In May and June 2005, Ontario hog farms experienced a major outbreak of the
H3N2 strain of swine influenza.

[Viruses often mutate; it is one of their means of survival. It is
impossible to say whether the outbreak of H3N2 affected swine resistance,
or perhaps viral survivability and expression of the PCV2.
In 1971 porcine circovirus type 1 (PCV1) was identified for the first time.
It was then regarded as a non-disease-causing agent. It appeared to occur
primarily in laboratory tissue cultures.
In 1991, some 20 years later, nursery pigs were reported to be ill with
clinical signs of progressive loss of condition and enlarged lymph nodes
that were visible to the veterinarians. The nursery pigs had difficulty
breathing, and although it was not in every pig, many had diarrhea, pale
skin, and jaundice.
This condition became known as "postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome"
(PMWS). From these infections a new circovirus (PCV2) was isolated.
Inoculation with PCV2 has successfully reproduced the disease in pigs.
The porcine circoviruses are perplexing. The statement by the National Pork
Board and the American Association of Swine Practitioners may well be the
most accurate description of this virus: "Circovirus associated diseases of
swine are of increasing concern to producers around the world. Much remains
unknown concerning the transmission, pathogenesis, epidemiology, and
control of risk factors involved in the expression of circovirus associated
diseases such as postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS), porcine
dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome (PDNS), porcine respiratory disease
complex (PRDC), and sporadic cases of PCV2-associated reproductive
failure." - Mod.TG]
