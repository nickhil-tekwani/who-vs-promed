[EUFMD's Quarterly FMD Situation Report, covering October -- December 2020 (see ref 1), mentioned that: "2 outbreaks were notified to the OIE on 15 Dec 2020 (date of start of the outbreaks: 1 Nov 2020; current status as of 13 Jan 2021: continuing). 5 cases were reported among sheep on 2 farms located in the Eastern region (Benghazi) with a population of 313 susceptible sheep and 26 goats. Clinical signs included fever, lameness, and abortion in some cases. No genotyping has been reported, but the AFRICA topotype, G-IV lineage has been reported previously.

"An investigation team from the National Centre for Animal Health (NCAH), Tripoli visited the areas around the infected premises in Benghazi, Al-Marj, Al-Abyaar, the Gulf of Sirte and Tukra. Sera from 173 cattle, sheep and goats were collected, with 9 sheep and 10 cattle samples from Benghazi and Al-Marj testing positive to NSP antibodies. Structural proteins (SP) ELISA testing to indicate the possible serotype is still pending, noting previous reports identified serotype A as the likely cause (Source: NCAH).

"Recently, the NCAH adopted a new FMD vaccination strategy, and is planning to receive 400 000 doses to vaccinate the cattle population in Libya (estimated at 100 000 head), providing 2 doses, 2 weeks apart. Small ruminants will also be vaccinated using a ring vaccination strategy in response to reported outbreaks. An FMD virtual awareness campaign targeting public and private vets on the topics of FMD diagnosis, sampling, biosecurity, and epidemiology is currently underway, also implemented by the NCAH, in collaboration with EuFMD and the FAO sub-regional office for North Africa".

EUFMD's Quarterly FMD Situation Report, covering January -- March 2021 (see ref 2), mentioned that: "FMD was reported to the OIE in January (2021) (OIE event ID: 33808, OIE World Animal Health Information System). Recently, the NCAH has launched a FMD mass vaccination campaign targeting all cattle populations (approximately 25 000 doses are available), where currently 94 000 doses have been distributed to 43 animal health offices in the east, west, and south of Libya. In parallel, blood samples are being collected to be tested against FMD and other transboundary animal diseases."

These two outbreaks mentioned in the quarterly report (October -- December 2020), are part of the event that started on 19 Feb 2020 where FMD serotype A was identified (OIE event ID 33808). The event is still continuing with 6 outbreaks reported (3 in Al Jifarah, 1 in Az Zawiyah, and 2 in Benghazi). The last follow-up report No. 9, on 17 Jan 2021 is available at https://wahis.oie.int/#/report-info?reportId=28170.
