There could be some interesting results indicating what is being shed by the
population contributing to the sewage facility. It would be necessary that
system had separate storm drain collection. We have seen for instance, the
regular occurrence of the STh toxin in raw and secondary sewage from plants
that process more than 2 MGD, but not in plants that handle less sewage
daily; STh or heat stable toxin in E. coli that is designated by h, meaning
it was isolated from humans; MGD is million gallons per day. Thus, it might
indicate diseases that are endemic in the community.
Another aspect that interests me is the use of sewage to indicate the
potential for increasingly drug resistant pathogens. We certainly know this
is occurring, but the link between use and the environment is less well
defined, although sewage and treated waste discharge seem a likely route.
