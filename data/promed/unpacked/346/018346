A 20-ton consignment of Uzbek fresh tomatoes arrived in the Irkutsk region [Russia]. Rosselkhoznadzor [Federal Service for Veterinary and Phytosanitary Surveillance] sent samples for examination. Virological results revealed _Pepino mosaic virus_ by PCR method. The test confirms the presence of a dangerous virus in the product. The virus was detected for the 1st time in Irkutsk region.

Currently, there is no means of combating the disease. Preventive measures should be observed (use clean seeds for sowing, check them for contamination, monitor crops during the seedling period, reject diseased plants). In a greenhouse where the infection is detected, it is necessary to observe quarantine throughout the growing season and strictly follow sanitary rules of production hygiene.

[_Pepino mosaic virus_ (PepMV, genus _Potexvirus_) was first identified on pepino (_Solanum muricatum_) in South America. It is spreading in the Americas and Europe and has also been reported from a few locations in Asia and Africa. PepMV can also infect potato and aubergine, but serious symptoms appear to occur only in tomato. Symptoms may include blotches and scarifications on fruit; mottling, distortion, necrosis on leaves and young shoots. The virus can cause significant economic losses, especially in glasshouse tomatoes, due mainly to reduction of fruit quality.

PepMV spreads very rapidly and is highly contagious. Specific insect vectors have not been identified. The virus is transmitted by mechanical means (including contaminated tools, human and insect activities, plant-to-plant contact), grafting, and with infected plant material (including insufficiently cleaned seed batches containing contaminated plant debris). True seed transmission (that is, via the embryo rather than the seed coat) is uncommon in potexviruses and appears unlikely for PepMV, but more research is needed. Disease management is usually focused on phytosanitation and use of certified clean seed and tomato explants.

Different strains of the virus exist for pepino and tomato. Coinfections have earlier been reported with _Potato virus S_ (genus _Carlavirus_) and _Tomato torrado virus_ (genus _Torradovirus_). Recently, coinfection with the newly identified _Tomato brown rugose fruit virus_ (genus _Tobamovirus_) was reported (ProMED post 20191029.6751082); it was thought that the observed symptoms on tomatoes may have been due to either virus or to synergism. Further studies are needed to clarify the effects of these interactions of PepMV with other viruses on crop damage.

Due to diligent and strict testing of imports (see also ProMED post 20201109.7930136), Russia appears so far successful in keeping national tomato production free of PepMV. This shows again the importance of an effective biosecurity system for national primary industries worldwide.
