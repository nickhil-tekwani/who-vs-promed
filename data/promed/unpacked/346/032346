Republic of the Congo: A Total of 149 Contacts under Surveillance
--------------------------------------------------
As of Wed 26 Feb 2003, 95 cases of Ebola fever have been confirmed in the
Cuvette-Ouest Region of the Republic of Congo (ROC), resulting thus far in
77 deaths, the World Health Organisation (WHO) reported [see: Ebola
hemorrhagic fever - Congo Rep. (11) 20030226.0484]. WHO further reported
that it had identified 149 other individuals who had been in contact with
people suffering from the highly contagious haemorrhagic fever, which has
been concentrated in the remote forest districts of Etoumbi, Mbomo, and
Kelle, near the border with Gabon.
The ROC Red Cross, which has 62 volunteers trained in techniques to combat
Ebola fever, has been involved in assessing the situation on the ground
together with the Health Ministry, the WHO and other agencies. They have
been attempting to heighten awareness of the disease, identify suspected
cases, enforce isolation and infection control measures, and promote good
practices among the local population, including not eating bushmeat or
touching dead animals, and adopting safe practices during funeral rites.
Meanwhile, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent
Societies on Wednesday launched an appeal for US $130 000 to help the ROC
Red Cross to monitor some 50 000 people for 3 months in remote parts of the
country. "Ebola is devastating and terrifying. It can kill those who care
for the sick, and those who perform funeral rites," said the International
Federation's senior epidemiologist, Dr Bernard Moriniere, in a Federation
statement issued on Monday. "Enforcing effective control measures while
establishing trust and respecting the fears, traditions, and beliefs of the
community is very difficult in a context of death and despair," Moriniere
added. "Community-based Red Cross volunteers can play a crucial role as a
trusted bridge that is often lacking in such situations."
The Federation said that Ebola was characterised by fever, diarrhoea,
severe blood loss, and intense fatigue, and transmitted through direct
contact with body fluids of infected persons or other primates. There is no
cure, and between 50 percent and 90 percent of victims die. The best way of
halting its spread was through prevention and prompt detection and
isolation of suspected cases, the Federation added. Accordingly, the
Brazzaville government quarantined the Cuvette-Ouest Region on 13 Feb 2003.
However, WHO said on Wednesday that the movement of people trying to escape
the epidemic had remained a source of concern.
