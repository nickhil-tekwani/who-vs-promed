Re: PRO/AH/EDR> Bovine brucellosis - Fiji
-----------------------------------------
What is the basis of the diagnosis of bovine brucellosis in this case
in Fiji? Several times the article mentions reactors -- I presume, to
some serological test. Which test and was there follow-up or re-test?
Nowhere do they describe abortion storms? There is mention of 'sick'
cattle, but nothing more specific.

In our Solomon Island survey [de Fredrick DF, Reece RL.(1980).
Diseases of cattle in the Solomon Islands. Aust Vet J. 1980 Nov;
56(11):522-5] we had many reactors to Rose Bengal Test performed by
myself and staff, but on further testing using CFT SAT etc at other
laboratories overseas, all were considered negative except for a
small group of imported cattle and these reactions were considered
inconclusive.

[Dr Reece's queries are valid and appreciated. An abstract of the
survey in the Solomon Islands, mentioned by him, is available at
<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7247885>.

It would help if an official information from Fiji, or from regional
agencies, becomes available. It would be tremendously helpful if
Fiji's information to OIE's WAHID interface is completed, including
the official status of Brucellosis since 2005 and particularly in
2008, the use (or absence) of vaccination, the cattle census and all
other data required from OIE member countries. - Mod.AS]
