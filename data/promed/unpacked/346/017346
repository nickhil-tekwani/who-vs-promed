England: Outbreak of Gastroenteritis in Staffordshire Hospital
-----------------------------------------------
A severe [viral infection] causing sickness and diarrhea is affecting
patients and staff at a Staffordshire hospital. Patients on 1/4 of the
wards at the University Hospital of North Staffordshire have been affected
by the 48-hour viral infection. Cleaning procedures have been stepped up,
and restricted admission is in place.
Medical specialists at the hospital have been advising patients, staff, and
visitors about precautions that can be taken to prevent the virus from
spreading. Visitors are being told to stay at home if they display any
symptoms. Dr. John Gray, a consultant microbiologist, says the illness has
been affecting people across all of north Staffordshire. Controlling the
disease in a closed community, like a hospital, can be extremely difficult,
he said.

Russia: Rotavirus Infection in Yoshkar Ola attributed to Contaminated
Cucumbers
-----------------------------------------------
During the 1st quarter of 2004 an outbreak of rotavirus infection occurred
in the city of Yoshkar-Ola [Mari El administrative district]. According to
the City Epidemiological Surveillance Center, 83 percent of the 73 cases
were children under the age of 2. The source of infection was discovered to
be fresh cucumbers, which were sold by a mini-market in Heroes [of the
battle of Stalingrad] Street.
The 1st signs of this infection were diarrhea, malaise, abdominal pain, and
fever. Epidemiologists are asking parents to be careful with feeding
children. All fruits and vegetables should be washed thoroughly, especially
during the flood season.

[3] Norovirus, universities - USA (North Carolina)

USA: Norovirus Outbreak Affects 3rd North Carolina University
-----------------------------------------------
About 2 months after it first hit the University of North Carolina at
Chapel Hill (UNC-CH) in Jan 2004, and one month after it plagued North
Carolina State University, a [gastroeneteritis] virus has struck Wake
Forest University in recent weeks, raising speculation about possible links
between the outbreaks. Officials are investigating potential causes,
including a pair of food service sites, but they still are not sure what
brought the norovirus infection to the campus, sickening 205 people between
14 Mar 2004 and last week.
"It was a pretty miserable time for the students and a pretty tough time
for our staff to put them through that," said Dr. Cecil Price of Wake
Forest's Student Health Service. Price added that officials haven't had
enough time to pinpoint the outbreak's cause and that they're still poring
over data and trying to determine whether any food service sites are to blame.
Both UNC-CH and Wake Forest hold contracts with Aramark Corp., a
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania-based company that provides food for dining
halls nationwide. Nevertheless, there is no evidence that the 2 outbreaks
are linked through food, and Pam Jenkins, a food-borne-disease nurse
epidemiologist for the North Carolina Department of Health, said students'
proximity to one another on campus is the likely culprit. "College campuses
are nothing more than a big cruise ship, because you're all together going
to class, going to sporting events, going to dining facilities," she said.
"You're in close contact." Jenkins added that the virus might have spread
from college to college as students at UNC-CH, Wake Forest, and North
Carolina State attended each other's sports matches, parties and other
social events.
UNC-CH suffered the 1st major outbreak of norovirus in January 2004, one that
health officials later determined was caused by tainted salad in Lenoir
Dining Hall. The investigation at North Carolina State turned up no
conclusive evidence of any single cause for the spread of virus infection
and concluded that person-to-person contact was the most likely culprit.
Still, Price said, it's hard to prevent an outbreak if one person contracts
the virus, particularly because students tend to go to class and remain in
public even when they're sick. "It's such a highly contagious [infection]
that it spreads like wildfire when it gets started," he said. Jenkins added
that the best way to prevent future outbreaks, regardless of their cause,
is to use common sense and to practice good hygiene. "If people get sick,
they need to stay away from other people," Jenkins said. "Stay home. Don't
go to school or work when you're sick. And when in doubt, wash your hands,
and that'll take care of it."
