[In this report, Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is the only
etiological agent mentioned as responsible for these encephalitis
cases. Previous reports from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar states this year
(2011) implicate JEV in approximately one-third of the encephalitis
cases, the majority being due to undiagnosed viruses, perhaps
enteroviruses, associated with contaminated water. One hopes that as
the season changes, these cases will end.
