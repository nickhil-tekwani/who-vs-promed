One person in Kimasian village in Ainamoi Constituency died after contracting anthrax. The 24-year-old mason contracted the epidemic disease while skinning the carcass of a cow with the disease. The deceased man was infected through a wound in his hand. Medical records from the Kericho County hospital indicated that the mason died from a cutaneous form of anthrax as evidenced by his skin.

Dr. David Rotich, a veterinary department officer with the county, said laboratory testing had revealed 2 cows that died in the village had the disease. He blamed the area residents for the unfortunate deaths because of their failure to vaccinate their cows and other domestic animals. Vaccination costs KES 50 [USD 0.50]. "It is unfortunate that anthrax vaccination has been ongoing, but locals have not been taking their animals for the crucial exercise," said Dr. Rotich. The veterinary doctor at the same time cautioned the residents against handling or consuming uninspected meat.

The Kapsoit Ward representative expressed gratitude to the veterinary department officers for acting swiftly to prevent more deaths. "They made sure that the carcass was disposed 6 feet [1.83 m] down and disinfected the affected area," he said. Chirchir pointed out that the last time a case of anthrax was reported in the ward was 7 years ago. Nonetheless, 3 cows in the village died of East Coast fever (ECF) last week.

[This is a different village from the previous Kericho County outbreak reported on 2 Jul 2018 [Anthrax - Kenya (03): (KR) bovine, human cases 20180702.5885473]. That had a "middle-aged" man die and 28 people checked at the hospital. Cuts in the hand and forearm while butchering a cow that died from anthrax ensures the person will also become infected. With 2 villages now affected, we can assume that there are other villages in Kericho County similarly inflicted, and all with reluctant vaccinating livestock owners. KES 50 is about USD 0.50, a cheap and an effective vaccine.

Kericho County is in the highlands west of the Kenyan Rift Valley. Standing on the edge of the Mau Forest, it has a warm and temperate climate, making it an ideal location for agriculture and, in particular, the large-scale cultivation of tea.
