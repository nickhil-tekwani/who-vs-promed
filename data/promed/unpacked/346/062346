----------------------------------------------------------------------
On 18 Jun 2020, a White non-Hispanic man aged 67 years sought care at an emergency department (ED) in Navajo County, Arizona, complaining of dehydration, nausea, weakness, and a chronic cough of 1.5 years duration. He had arrived in Navajo County from Nebraska about 9 days earlier. On physical exam, he was tachycardic and tachypneic. His chest radiograph and computed tomographic angiography chest scan with contrast were normal, and he was discharged after receiving intravenous fluids. He returned to the ED the next day [19 Jun 2020] for treatment of 3 red and painful suspected insect bites on his leg and was discharged the same day with a diagnosis of cellulitis and 2 antimicrobial prescriptions (Figure -- available at the source URL. - Mod.LL). He returned to the ED the following day [20 Jun 2021] complaining of fever, dizziness, productive worsening cough, "swollen glands" (location not noted), weakness, and chills.

He was hospitalized and received treatment with four antibacterials for a presumptive diagnosis of sepsis. Test results of nasopharyngeal specimens collected on [18 Jun and 21 Jun 2021] were negative for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, and other respiratory pathogens. On 24 June, the hospital laboratory reported an atypical Gram negative isolate from a blood specimen, which was sent that day to a commercial reference laboratory for further identification using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF). The organism was identified as _Yersinia pseudotuberculosis_, a Gram negative, rod-shaped organism, and reported to the hospital on [30 Jun 2021]. The patient was discharged from the hospital on [1 Jul 2020] with a peripherally inserted central catheter line and 3 additional days of a 14-day course of intravenous vancomycin.

On 10 Jul 2020, the hospital laboratory sent a blood culture isolate to Arizona State Public Health Laboratory (ASPHL) and _Yersinia pestis_ was presumptively identified on [12 Jul 2020] using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction testing. The hospital was notified of the presumptive results. After ASPHL culture confirmed _Y. pestis_ on [15 Jul 2020] and classified the case as septicemic plague, the patient was prescribed a 10-day course of oral doxycycline and completed it. Delays in identification of the isolate as _Y. pestis_ were attributed to initial misidentification of the pathogen and delays in laboratory reporting.

Blood samples collected on [20 Jun 2020] were cultured in the hospital. Arizona Administrative Code R9-6-204A requires laboratories to submit all _Yersinia_ spp. isolates and report to ASPHL within 1 working day (1); in this case, a 10-day delay in submission of the isolate and report to ASPHL occurred. The reason for the delay in testing or reporting by the reference laboratory or hospital laboratory is unclear.

Timely identification of a pathogen and treatment of the patient are critical to public health response and investigation of highly infectious pathogens such as _Y. pestis_. Plague is rare in Arizona and was last reported in 2017 in a Navajo County resident. The patient identified in 2020 had reported gloved handling of a dead pack rat before symptom onset; an environmental investigation noted many rodent habitats, but no fleas were collected. Typical transmission of _Y. pestis_ to humans occurs through flea bites, exposure to sick animals (such as pets), or contact with contaminated tissues or body fluids (2). With rare pathogens, particularly in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, timely laboratory identification is crucial for accurate clinical diagnosis and treatment; re-education was conducted with the laboratories regarding the reporting requirements. This patient did not receive high-efficacy antimicrobial treatment, a tetracycline, until about 30 days after symptom onset; he recovered, possibly in part because he received therapy with some demonstrated efficacy against _Y. pestis_, including trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, early in the illness course (3).

Misidentification of _Y. pestis_ isolates as _Y. pseudotuberculosis_ can occur with MALDI-TOF and other automated systems (4,5). Timely use of high-efficacy therapies including aminoglycosides and tetracyclines significantly increases the odds of survival in patients with plague (6). Rapid reporting might have led to a timelier diagnosis of his acute illness and initiation of a more effective antibacterial therapy closer to disease onset.

[The reasons for the delay in testing and reporting are of concern as septicemic plague can be rapidly fatal. Certainly, it is likely that the initial antimicrobial "cocktail" that he received had enough activity against the plague bacillus to prevent mortality. When he was discharged after the diagnosis of _Y. pseudotuberculosis_, it is unclear why he went home on vancomycin which is not active against this Gram negative bacillus.

The following is extracted from reference 5 (above) regarding the identification issues here with the original citations left intact:

"Automated bacterial identification systems increasingly are used in clinical microbiology laboratories to provide rapid identification, thus reducing turnaround times and improving efficiency and cost-effectiveness (8). These systems automatically perform 3 major functions for identification: monitoring biochemical reactions during growth of an isolate (such as lactose fermentation, catalase positivity, and oxidase positivity); comparison of an isolate's characteristics with data for multiple organisms in the system's database; and completion of computerized calculations to determine the probability of identification, or confidence value, based on the patterns of biochemical results. These systems allow accurate and rapid identification of commonly isolated bacterial organisms; however, they are less likely to correctly identify slow-growing, fastidious, rare, or biochemically inert organisms, including select agents such as _Francisella tularensis_, _Burkholderia pseudomallei_, _Brucella_ species, and _Yersinia pestis_ (6,9). Indications of potential misidentification by automated systems include a low probability or confidence value, an identification of a pathogen inconsistent with the clinical or microbiology picture, or both.

"Results from automated systems should be analyzed critically, taking into consideration the reliability of these systems for accurate identification of slow-growing and/or rare organisms. In clinical microbiology laboratories, gram-negative isolates that exhibit bipolar staining and are pinpoint (slow-growing) colonies at 24 hours, nonlactose fermenters, and catalase-positive but urease- and oxidase-negative should trigger immediate consideration of _Y. pestis_, particularly in enzootic areas. If suspicion arises for _Y. pestis_, the state public health department should be contacted, and the isolate should be sent to the state public health laboratory for further testing."

It is vitally important to understand these issues when identifying these types of organisms. - Mod.LL
