Peru: Hepatitis B virus Outbreak Threatens to Wipe Out 2 Amazon Tribes
---------------------------------------------------
The United Nations said on Tue 23 Sep 2003 that it had launched a
vaccination campaign to save 2 tribes in the remote Peruvian Amazon,
which were threatened with extinction by a mysterious hepatitis B
virus outbreak.

"Local leaders warned that (the 2 tribes) could face extinction
within 10 to 12 years, if preventive action, especially among
children, is not taken," the U.N. children's fund UNICEF said in a
statement.

Peru's Health Minister asked UNICEF for help after 40 deaths were
recorded in 2002 in one of the tribes, the Candoshi, which has only
2500 members. They suffered 145 cases in 2001 but it was not known
how many people died that year. There were no comparable data for a
neighboring tribe, the Sharpas, who were also at risk. UNICEF aims to
vaccinate all the 150 babies in the tribe 3 times before they are one
year old to try to eradicate the disease, which can cause liver
failure. The cause of the outbreak is a mystery, as is the reason for
the "amazingly" high mortality rate in a disease that often takes 20
to 25 years to manifest itself, said UNICEF spokesman Damien
Personnaz.

The tribes live along the Pastaza and Morona rivers in an area of the
Amazon basin so remote that travel from any of the 124 communities in
which they live to the nearest health center can take 4 days.

[Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is endemic in tropical regions of
the Amazon river basin. Periodic epidemics of severe acute disease
with rapid progression to fulminant hepatitis (with case-fatality
rates of 10-20 percent) have been observed among chronic HBV carriers
in these regions. These outbreaks of severe disease have been
associated in some instances (see the reference below for more
detailed information) with co-infection by hepatitis D virus, a
defective (and genetically unrelated) virus, which can propagate
itself only in the presence of HBV, and which is also present in the
Amazon river basin. It may be that hepatitis D virus plays a role in
the epidemiology of hepatitis in these 2 small tribal populations.
Control of HBV infection using HBV vaccine would eradicate
simultaneously any hepatitis D virus, since it is dependent on HBV
for its replication. - Mod.CP]
