The measles outbreak in the United States continues to grow. As of Fri [30 Aug], the number of cases reached 1234. That's according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That number is 19 cases more than the previous week.

Cases have been confirmed in 31 states.

The CDC says most are among people who were not vaccinated against measles.

It also reported more than 75% of measles cases were linked to outbreaks in New York State and New York City.

A director at the CDC says there's a 'reasonable chance' the U.S. will lose its measles-elimination status in October [2019] because of ongoing outbreaks in New York.

[2] New York: religious exemptions
Date: Mon 2 Sep 2019

https://www.timesofisrael.com/after-religious-exemptions-nixed-ny-parents-scramble-to-vaccinate-kids/


When New York lawmakers revoked a religious exemption for mandatory school vaccinations, the change sent thousands of the state's parents scrambling to get their kids shots -- or get them out of the classroom entirely.

Lawmakers did away with the exemption in June [2019] amid the nation's worst measles outbreak since 1992. More than 26 000 children in public and private schools and day care centers had previously gone unvaccinated for religious reasons, according to the state Health Department.

Now time is running short. Unvaccinated students have 14 days from the start of school to prove they received the 1st dose of each immunization, and they must make appointments for the next round within a month. Most schools reopen just after Labor Day [2 Sep].

Some parents opposed to vaccinations are choosing to pull their kids from school rather than comply.

New York became the 4th state, along with California, Mississippi and West Virginia, to eliminate religious and personal-belief exemptions for vaccines. Maine will remove them in 2021. All states allow medical exemptions.

More than 1200 cases of measles have been confirmed in 30 states this year [2019], more than three-quarters of them linked to outbreaks in New York and New York City, the Centers for Disease Control reported.

Many of the New York cases have been among unvaccinated people in Orthodox Jewish communities. Resistance to vaccinations remains, despite scientific evidence that they are both safe and effective.

The State Health Department will audit schools to assure compliance with the new law and require unvaccinated students without a valid medical excuse to leave school, spokeswoman Jill Montag said. Schools already submit annual surveys about immunization coverage and are subject to spot checks to confirm their answers. Schools that violate the rules could face fines. "We do not anticipate having any problems securing compliance," Montag said in an email.

Before the statewide law change, the New York City Health Department closed 12 schools that could not prove students were vaccinated following an April [2019] emergency order. ...

The US Supreme Court ruled in 1905 that states have the right to enforce compulsory vaccination laws.

Opponents have filed at least 2 unsuccessful lawsuits. A hearing for one drew more than 1000 people to the Albany County Courthouse.

[3] New York: outbreak in Orthodox community over

https://www.thejc.com/news/us-news/measles-outbreak-in-strictly-orthodox-areas-is-over-new-york-health-official-oxiris-barbot-declares-1.488164


A measles outbreak affecting mainly Orthodox Jewish neighbourhoods in New York is at an end, officials declared on [Tue 3 Sep 2019]. The city's health commissioner Oxiris Barbot said 2 incubation periods had passed since the last reported cases without any new infections.

But she added that a threat remained from what she called "one of the most contagious diseases on the face of the earth", and that children must be immunised before the start of the new academic term. "Staying up to date on vaccines is the best way for people to protect the health and safety of their friends, family and neighbours," Ms. Barbot told AP.

There have been 654 cases of measles since an outbreak in Jewish neighborhoods of Brooklyn that began in October 2018. Officials said it was the highest number of cases in 3 decades, prompting state politicians in New York to revoke a religious exemption to mandatory school vaccinations.

In April [2019] New York City ordered all yeshivas in a Strictly Orthodox areas of Brooklyn to keep students out of class if they are not vaccinated against measles, or face a possible fine or closure.

Three other US states -- California, Mississippi and West Virginia -- have eliminated religious and personal-belief exemptions for vaccines.

Cases have been reported as far afield as Canada, where an outbreak in Montreal's Chassidic community has prompted a vaccination programme for hundreds of children.

[5] Hawaii: imported

https://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/2019/09/03/health-dept-confirms-case-measles-hawaii-resident/


State health officials confirmed on [Tue 2 Sep 2019] that there was 1 case of measles reported in a Hawaii resident who got sick while traveling in another state.

Officials did not provide any other details such as where or when that resident contracted the highly-infectious disease.

The Centers for Disease Control said so far this year [2019], there have been 1234 cases of measles in 31 states.

"Because CDC reports cases based on their area of residence, the individual is counted as a Hawaii case even though they contracted the disease in another state," the state Department of Health said, in an emailed statement. "If DOH had any reported measles case that was locally transmitted, we would announce the information immediately."

This is the greatest number of cases in the U.S. since 1992, the CDC said.

According to the CDC, more than 75% of cases this year [2019] have been linked to outbreaks in New York. But health officials on [Tue 3 Sep 2019] declared the New York City outbreak has ended.

[6] Mexico

Source: Mexico News Daily [abridged, edited]
https://mexiconewsdaily.com/news/measles-was-eradicated-in-1996-but-cases-are-on-the-rise/


Secretariat of Health (Salud) has confirmed 12 cases of measles and is investigating over 500 more possible instances of the disease. The number of confirmed cases could increase as the tests are processed.

The cases have been brought to Mexico by travelers from abroad, but Tourism Secretary Miguel Torruco said his department is not concerned about the disease.

The most recent case occurred in Playa del Carmen, Quintana Roo, in early August [2019] when a health worker was infected by an Austrian tourist. It was the state's 4th this year. Cases have also been confirmed in Chihuahua, Nuevo León, San Luís Potosí and México state.

All of the confirmed cases have been described as "imported," primarily by tourists who visit the country unvaccinated. Studies revealed the viruses came from Europe and Africa, although there are 6 cases in which the source of the virus is still unknown.

Prevention and health promotion undersecretary Dr. Hugo López-Gatell Ramírez said that Mexico is potentially at risk for larger outbreaks of measles as vaccination rates have declined in recent years.

In the previous presidential administration, they fell to a "historically low" 70%, he said. Vaccination rates need to be as high as 95% in order to guarantee the prevention of outbreaks.

Mexico eradicated measles in 1996. There was one native case of the disease in 2006, but the country has not seen numbers like this year's for decades.

López-Gatell stated that there are currently red-flag areas outside Mexico that could be cause for worry, such as New York City, which declared a public health emergency earlier this year [2019] due to an outbreak.

The Health Secretariat issued recommendations for the prevention of measles in April for people traveling to Europe and the United States, in which it listed specific U.S. states that had confirmed cases of the disease.

The office declined requests for an interview.

Despite the cases in Mexico having been brought by foreign visitors, Tourism Secretary Miguel Torruco Marqués told Mexico News Daily that his department is not concerned about the disease and there are currently no vaccination requirements for tourists entering Mexico from countries where measles is a problem.

[8] Serbia: measles outbreak declared over
Date: Sun 1 Sep 2019
From: Jovicic Aleksandar <jovicic.aleksandar@gmail.com> [edited]


The Institute of Public Health of Serbia declared end of measles outbreak after almost 2 years since its start.

Bearing in mind that double maximum incubation period for measles infection has passed, considering that vaccination coverage has been significantly improved in 2018 to 93.4%, and only 15 cases has been reported during 2019, the conditions to declare the end of measles outbreak in the Republic of Serbia have been met.

Since October 2017 when the outbreak started, 5798 cases and 15 fatalities have been reported (CFR: 2.59 per 1000).

The first suspected cases were reported at the beginning of October 2017. The circulation of _Morbillivirus_ in population was laboratory confirmed on [6 Oct 2017] and outbreak declared on [23 Oct 2017]. At that time, total number of laboratory-confirmed cases was 7. Low herd immunity level and high contagiousness of virus led to rapid spread of disease. Vaccine coverage at that time was only 81% in total, while in major cities (Belgrade and Nis) it was below 70%. The first fatality was reported at the end of December 2017 (after a period of 20 years without fatalities from measles).

The peak of the outbreak was reached at the end of [February 2018], together with the majority of fatalities. An intense campaign of the importance of immunization led to improvements in vaccination coverage reaching 93.4% in total (94.3% in central Serbia and 90.9% in Vojvodina). The catch-up campaign resulted in 13 674 children vaccinated with 1st dose of MMR (who missed vaccination by regular immunization calendar) as well as 3233 children vaccinated by 2nd dose and 1452 who got both doses.

In 2019, only 15 cases have been reported of which 4 were imported (from Russia, Ukraine, Austria and North Macedonia). Last reported case was in June 2019.

[Note the virus is referred to as _Morbillivirus_. Measles _morbillivirus_, formerly called measles virus (MeV), is a single-stranded, negative-sense, enveloped, non-segmented RNA virus of the genus _Morbillivirus_ within the family _Paramyxoviridae_. It is the cause of measles. This is wonderful news and Serbia should be congratulated on its successful campaign against measles. - Mod.LK]

[9] Europe update
Date: Thu 4 Sep 2019
Source: EU Policies [abridged, edited]
http://eu-policies.com/news/despite-eu-efforts-measles-cases-still-rise/


Health campaigners have warned that the number of measles cases will continue to rise if vaccination isn't brought back up to previous levels. And in a recent report, the WHO has found the disease has returned in 4 EU countries that had previously eliminated it.

In the UK, Greece, the Czech Republic and Albania, new outbreaks of measles have been blamed on anti-vaccination campaigns on social media. There have also been increases in the number of cases in other states, including Poland and Slovakia.

In a poll carried out by Eurobarometer, 85% of EU citizens believe vaccines are effective in preventing diseases. However, nearly 50% believe they can also cause serious side effects.

Although the EU has been working on increasing awareness and coordination on vaccination programmes, the WHO found that, in the 1st half of 2019, the number of cases had doubled from the previous period - from 44 175 to 89 994.

The group Vaccines Europe believe that this is inaccurate and that vaccines are essential and should be encouraged by the EU.

But some health groups believe that it should be up to individual member states, not the EU, to decide whether vaccination should be mandatory and to develop their own strategies to increase coverage.

In an interview, Dr. Günter Pfaff, chair of the European Regional Verification Commission for Measles and Rubella Elimination said: "Re-establishment of measles transmission is concerning. If high immunisation coverage is not achieved and sustained in every community, both children and adults will suffer unnecessarily and some will tragically die."

Last year [2018], the European Commission proposed that it could strengthen its voluntary cooperation against vaccine-preventable diseases. This was not adopted by the council, but it's been agreed that action needs to be taken to stop "forgotten" diseases returning.

Going forward, Health Commissioner Vytenis Andriukaitis has called for policymakers and health professionals to make sure the public is fully informed in order to boost national vaccination programmes
