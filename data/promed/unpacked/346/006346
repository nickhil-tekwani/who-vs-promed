More than a dozen people have been sickened by salmonella in Denmark since mid-September [2021]. The Statens Serum Institute, Danish Veterinary and Food Administration (Fødevarestyrelsen) and the DTU Food Institute are investigating to see if the source of infection could be recently recalled Danish eggs. There is concern that consumers may still have some of the recalled eggs in their homes because they have best-before dates of [12 and 16 Nov 2021].

The Danish Veterinary and Food Administration took environmental samples at a producer of eggs on [25 Sep 2021]. Most samples were positive for _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Enteritidis but it is not yet known if it is the same type found in human cases.

The 15 sick people live all over the country with 7 cases in Syddanmark, 3 in Midtjylland, 2 each in Nordjylland and Sjælland and 1 in Hovedstaden. The patients are 7 women and 8 men aged from 2 to 85 years old. As many as 7 of them have been hospitalized, which is higher than the normal hospitalization rate for patients infected with salmonella. Whole-genome sequencing found the strains from patients were very closely related to each other, which means it is likely there was a common source of infection.

Danaeg has recalled eggs stamped with 081131 as the last 6 digits. It involves free-range eggs stamped with 1DK081131 branded Danæg and Landlyst and caged eggs marked 3DK081131 branded Henriettelund with best before dates of [16 Nov 2021]. They were sold at stores including Spar, Meny, Fakta, Aldi, Coop 365 and SuperBrugsen as well as on Nemlig.com. The Danish Veterinary and Food Administration advised consumers to take affected eggs back to the store where they were purchased or to discard them.

In Sweden, Kronägg recalled eggs from Danaeg's packing plant with plant number DK7003 due to potential _Salmonella_ contamination. Eggs stamped with the code 2DK081131 were sold at Lidl stores and have a best before date of [12 Nov 2021]. The implicated eggs were also sent to parts of Germany.

[Although not specifically stated, it sounds like both the human cases and suspected eggs have yielded the same serotype (or serovar) Enteritidis but they have not yet been linked by whole genome sequencing.

Salmonellosis is often thought to be associated with cracked eggs or eggs dirty with fecal matter, a problem controlled by cleaning procedures implemented in the egg industry. Most of the salmonellosis outbreaks linked to eggs have been associated with uncracked, disinfected grade A eggs, or foods containing such eggs. The undamaged eggs become contaminated during ovulation and thus become contaminated with the bacteria before the egg shell is formed. To avoid this, uncooked eggs should be used as an ingredient only if pasteurized. - Mod.LL
