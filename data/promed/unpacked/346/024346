Outbreak of Aflatoxin Poisoning -- Eastern and Central Provinces, Kenya,
January-July 2004
------------------------
In May 2004, CDC Kenya, trainees of the CDC-supported Field Epidemiology
and Laboratory Training Program (FELTP) in Kenya, the World Health
Organization, and CDC were invited by the Kenya Ministry of Health (KMOH)
to participate in the investigation of an outbreak of jaundice with a high
case-fatality rate (CFR) in the districts of Makueni and Kitui, Eastern
Province. Preliminary laboratory testing of food collected from the
affected area revealed high levels of aflatoxin, suggesting that the
outbreak was caused by aflatoxin poisoning, as was a previous outbreak in
the same area in 1981 (1).
In the United States, aflatoxin concentrations are limited to 20 parts per
billion (ppb), a level also adopted by Kenyan authorities. The 2004
outbreak resulted from widespread aflatoxin contamination of locally grown
maize, which occurred during storage of the maize under damp conditions.
Urgent replacement of the aflatoxin-contaminated maize with noncontaminated
maize proved to be a critical intervention; however, as of 21 Jul 2004, a
limited number of new cases continued to be detected. This report
summarizes the preliminary results of the outbreak investigation. Aflatoxin
poisoning likely will continue to be a public health problem until
culturally appropriate storage methods for dry maize are implemented by the
local population. In addition, enhanced surveillance for human aflatoxin
poisoning and testing of commercially sold maize for aflatoxin levels will
lead to long-term improvements in public health.
Joint KMOH and CDC teams conducted patient interviews and reviewed medical
records dating back to 1 Jan 2004, in 3 health facilities in the Makueni
and Kitui districts. Additional case finding was conducted through similar
patient interviews and retrospective record reviews in 7 health facilities
in adjacent districts of Eastern Province (Machakos, Embu, Mbeere, and
Mwingi districts) and Central Province (Thika district) and at Kenyatta
National Hospital in Nairobi [see Figure 1 at URL link provided above].
Large-scale active surveillance occurred from early May to late June
[2004]. As of 21 Jul 2004, 3 health facilities in Makueni and Kitui
districts continued to be monitored for new cases. A convenience sample of
20 patient households was visited to assess the occurrence of jaundice in
nonhospitalized household members and to inspect food quality and storage.
In this investigation, a case of suspected aflatoxin poisoning was defined
as a case of acute jaundice that occurred after 1 Jan 2004, in a resident
of Eastern or Central Province or a case diagnosed at Kenyatta National
Hospital in a patient who was not known to have chronic liver disease or
any other cause of jaundice.
As of 20 Jul 2004, a total of 317 cases had been reported, with 125 deaths
(CFR = 39 percent). An increase in case reports began in the 3rd week of
April, with new cases continuing to occur through mid-July [2004 -- see
Figure 2 at above given URL link]. Of the 308 patients for whom age data
were available, 68 (22.1 percent) were aged less than 5 years; 90 (29.2
percent) were aged 5--14 years, and 150 (48.7 percent) were aged greater
than 15 years. Of the 317 total patients, 178 (56.2 percent) were male, and
280 (88.3 percent) resided in 4 districts: Makueni (148 [46.7 percent]),
Kitui (101 [31.8 percent]), Machakos (19 [6.0 percent]), and Thika (12 [3.8
percent]). The remaining 37 (11.7 percent) patients had aflatoxicosis
diagnosed at Kenyatta National Hospital in Nairobi or at health facilities
in Embu, Mbeere, or Mwingi districts. CFR was significantly higher in
Makueni district (CFR = 49.3 percent) than in Kitui district (CFR = 23.7
percent) (CFR ratio = 2.1; 95 percent confidence interval [CI] = 1.4--3.1).
Preliminary results from a case-control study that compared 40
case-patients with 80 well controls matched by village in Makueni and Kitui
districts demonstrated a statistically significant association between the
development of jaundice and several risk factors or markers, including 1)
reported consumption of cooked maize kernels (odds ratio [OR] = 8.0; 95
percent CI = 1.7--37.1), 2) reported possession of homegrown maize that was
discolored or visibly contaminated with mold (OR = 5.9; 95 percent CI =
1.9--18.2), 3) consumption of homegrown maize (OR = 3.0; 95 percent CI =
1.0--8.8), 3) storage of damp maize (OR = 3.5; 95 percent CI = 1.2--10.3),
4) inside storage of maize rather than outside granary storage (OR = 12.0;
95 percent CI = 1.5--95.7), and 5) reported deaths of dogs or livestock (OR
= 3.3; 95 percent CI = 1.2--9.1).
Food samples collected from household visits during 10-19 May 2004 included
maize flour, maize grains, dry maize cobs, muthokoi (i.e., maize in which
the outer hulls have been removed), millet, sorghum, and beans. A total of
31 samples were tested by the Kenya National Public Health Laboratory
Services, and 15 had greater than 20 ppb aflatoxin B1 (range: 20--8000 ppb).
A representative survey of maize products from agricultural markets and
outlets [see Figure 3 in above given URL link] in Makueni, Kitui, Thika,
and Machakos districts was conducted to assess the extent and magnitude of
aflatoxin contamination in the sampled maize. Preliminary results indicated
widespread, high-level aflatoxin contamination. A total of 182 (53.2
percent) of 342 samples had greater than 20 ppb of aflatoxin. In addition,
a substantial percentage of samples from each district had aflatoxin levels
greater than 1000 ppb: Makueni (12.1 percent), Kitui (9.6 percent), Thika
(3.9 percent), and Machakos (2.9 percent).
The government of Kenya is providing replacement food in the most heavily
affected districts: Makueni district (population: 771 545) and Kitui
district (population: 515 422). Residents of affected districts have been
advised to avoid consumption of maize or other foods suspected to be moldy
or appearing discolored. In addition, food inspections by public health
authorities are being conducted, and suspect food is being seized,
destroyed, and replaced. Surveillance for possible aflatoxin poisoning in
humans has been extended to other parts of Kenya by MOH, and aflatoxin
screening of maize has been increased.

MMWR Editorial Note:
Evidence that this outbreak resulted from aflatoxin poisoning included 1)
high levels of aflatoxin (up to 8000 ppb) in maize samples collected from
patient households, 2) a clinical illness consistent with acute aflatoxin
poisoning, 3) clustering of cases among residents of the same household,
and 4) reports of deaths among animals known to have eaten the same maize
as the patients during the same period. Serum specimens from a convenience
sample of 7 patients were tested for differential viral etiologies. All 7
patients had negative serologic tests for yellow fever, dengue, West Nile
virus, Rift Valley fever, Chikungunya and Bunyamwera viruses, acute
hepatitis A, acute hepatitis B, and hepatitis C.
Aflatoxins are a group of metabolic products formed by 2 species of fungus,
_Aspergillus flavus_ and _A. parasiticus_, in several agricultural
commodities, including corn or maize. 2 structural types of aflatoxins are
known (B and G types), of which aflatoxin B1 is considered the most toxic
and was the type most commonly found in Kenya during this outbreak.
Exposure to aflatoxins occurs primarily through ingestion of contaminated
foods (2) and can cause hepatic and gastrointestinal injury and have
immunosuppressive, teratogenic, and oncogenic effects. Chronic low-level
aflatoxin exposure can increase the risk for hepatocellular carcinoma (3).
Severe, acute liver injury with high morbidity and mortality has been
associated with high-dose exposures to aflatoxins (4). Ingestion of 2--6
mg/day of aflatoxin for a month can cause acute hepatitis and death (5,6).
The largest reported outbreak of aflatoxicosis to date occurred in western
India in 1974, resulting in 397 recognized cases and 106 deaths (6). The
ongoing epidemic in Kenya already has resulted in 125 recognized deaths.
Because of the remoteness of villages in the affected districts in Kenya
and the large geographic area involved, case finding has been limited to
medical facilities. In addition, because some persons might not have been
able to reach health-care facilities for diagnosis and treatment, the true
magnitude of this outbreak is likely to be considerably greater than reported.
An outbreak of acute aflatoxicosis (20 cases; CFR = 60 percent) was
reported previously in Makueni district, Eastern Province, Kenya, in 1981
(1). Patients were clustered in family groups that shared meals consisting
of aflatoxin-contaminated maize (1600-12 000 ppb). Acute hepatitis
associated with consumption of moldy grains also has been reported in other
areas in Africa, Western India, and Malaysia (6--8), where affected persons
came from areas prone to drought and malnutrition and unseasonable rains
forced the harvest of grains before adequate drying had occurred.
Typically, increased reports of jaundice and hepatitis followed within
weeks of such harvests (6--8). Locally produced maize associated with this
outbreak was harvested in February [2004] during peak rains, and the 1st
illnesses were reported in Makueni district in late March and early April
[2004].
For every symptomatic case of aflatoxicosis identified, several other
persons likely were exposed to unsafe levels of aflatoxin and might face
future adverse health consequences. In addition, individual cases or
clusters of aflatoxin poisoning likely occur regularly but are not
recognized. Efforts should focus on the prevention of aflatoxin exposure by
implementing extensive food replacement, without which, the epidemic can be
expected to continue. Longer-term requirements include strengthened
surveillance; increased food inspections to ensure food safety; and local
education and assistance to ensure that maize is harvested correctly, dried
completely, and stored properly.
This report describes the first investigation by the Kenya FELTP, a
partnership of CDC, KMOH, and Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and
Technology intended to build public health, epidemiologic, and laboratory
capacity in Kenya. This investigation provided field experience to these
Kenyan public health workers in training and exemplified collaboration
between different national and international agencies and among various
sectors and disciplines, including health, agriculture, food safety,
nutrition, and humanitarian relief. Increased collaboration between the
health sector and others involved in food security and safety could enable
early warning of high levels of aflatoxins.
As a result of widespread drought, Kenya faces an acute food shortage, with
nearly 1.8 million persons in 26 districts vulnerable to food insecurity
(9), including persons in the area most heavily affected by the
aflatoxicosis outbreak. Because an estimated 166 000 metric tons of food
will be required to meet the requirements of emergency and school feeding
programs during August 2004-January 2005, public health officials should be
vigilant to a possible wider aflatoxicosis outbreak resulting from the
large-scale storage and distribution of certain emergency food supplies.

[This is an excellent summary of the multisectoral investigation into this
unfortunate outbreak. See ProMED-mail postings listed below for further
discussion. It is noteworthy that, according to Fig 2 in the above report,
the major increase in cases began in late April 2004, with awareness of the
problem in the health sector prior to implementation of active surveillance
at the beginning of May.
<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5334a4.htm>
The 1st reports became public via the media in the 2nd week of May (see
ProMED-mail posting of 13 May 2004]. However, from retrospective chart
reviews, a low level of aflatoxin poisoning since 1 Jan 2004 seems
likely. Hence, it appears this is a chronic background problem in Kenya
that required a major increase in cases to come to the attention of the
authorities. The MMWR editorial summarizes this well: "In addition,
individual cases or clusters of aflatoxin poisoning likely occur regularly
but are not recognized. Efforts should focus on the prevention of aflatoxin
exposure by implementing extensive food replacement, without which, the
epidemic can be expected to continue. Longer-term requirements include
strengthened surveillance; increased food inspections to ensure food
safety; and local education and assistance to ensure that maize is
harvested correctly, dried completely, and stored properly." - Mod.MPP]
