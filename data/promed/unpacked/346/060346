[The following has been extracted from the OIE Peste des petits ruminants Portal, available at https://www.oie.int/en/animal-health-in-the-world/ppr-portal/about/:

"Peste des petits ruminants is characterized by severe morbidity and mortality rates and has a high economic impact in areas of Africa, the Middle East, and Asia, where small ruminants contribute to guaranteeing livelihoods.

"Affected animals present high fever and depression, along with eye and nose discharges. Animals cannot eat, as the mouth becomes covered in painful erosive lesions, and the animals suffer from severe pneumonia and diarrhoea. Death is frequently the outcome.

"The OIE and the FAO developed jointly the Global Control and Eradication Strategy of PPR under the Global Framework for the progressive control of Transboundary Animal Diseases (GF-TADs).
