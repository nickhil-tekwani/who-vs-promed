I would like to ask a retraction to the Moderator's comment, that
follows, under this posting unless the Moderator otherwise has
evidence (none provided in the commentary):

"This is not the 1st report of this disease in Canada, but it is an
expansion of the disease."

To our knowledge, this disease has never been reported in Canada.
This is a geographic extension of distribution of the disease and an
extension of the range of susceptible species.

[I appreciate Dr Klotins's comment correcting my misunderstanding. It
was a misinterpretation of the wording of a news report that lead to
my incorrect understanding. My apology is extended to our readers and
especially to Canada. Thank for your sharp eyes and your effort to
keep our reporting accurate. - Mod.TG]
