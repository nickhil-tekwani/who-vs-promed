I spoke to a senior professor of infectious disease yesterday who
confirmed what was also evident in the local press and in my own
small clinic: the influenza epidemic in Northern China seems to be
over. It "peaked" about three weeks ago. There are only sporadic
cases remaining.
The number of deaths attributed to influenza this year appears to be
remarkably low considering the severity of symptoms caused by the
virus.
Although one newspaper report did say there was an increase in the
number of cremations, other reports (including my very reliable
contact at PUMCH) note that there were *not* a significant number of
deaths from influenza. She admitted that individuals with underlying
COPD did die, but evidently not much more than would be the case in
other flu seasons.

COPD = chronic obstructive pulmonary disease - Mod.JW
In my own clinic I was impressed with the severity of the symptoms --
especially with my younger (college-age) patients. Students
returning "home" to Beijing for Christmas became ill about two weeks
after their arrival in Beijing (during the peak of the epidemic).
Most of them were *not* immunized against influenza this year,
although our own experience here certainly suggests the immunization
offered little protection against the virus.
A Beijing laboratory has reportedly sent specimens back to CDC for
analysis. Certainly we all hope this is the case, but I am having a
little trouble confirming it. In any one flu season one is rarely
dealing with a single virus, and just how many viruses and *which*
viruses were involved this year is not yet clear.
