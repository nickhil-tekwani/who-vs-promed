After a hare hunt near Darmstadt (Germany) on 29 Oct 2005 in which 27
hunters and beaters took part, 9 hunters and one beater fell ill with
tularemia. On 28 Nov 2005, the authorities were informed of a case of
brucellosis. It concerned a man who fell ill with fever above 40 degrees C,
swollen lymph nodes, fatigue, arthralgia, and headache. He had taken part
in gutting the hares and cut his left thumb.
He was treated with antimicrobial agents. After cessation of therapy, his
lymph nodes grew and he was admitted to a hospital (between 21-28 Nov
2005). Under therapy with streptomycin and ciprofloxacin the symptoms
declined. The serological diagnosis of tularemia was made on 1 Dec 2005.
In retrospect, the diagnosis of brucellosis was interpreted as a false
positive result due to known cross-reactions between the brucellosis and
tularemia bacilli.
Investigation by the health authorities uncovered 9 more participants who
fell sick between 3 and 9 Nov 2005 predominantly with high fever,
shivering, lymphadenitis, headache, and muscle aches. 2 of the hunters who
had acquired cuts while gutting the hares developed ulcers at the sites.
The age of those affected was between 11 and 73 years.
In 9 cases, the infection was serologically confirmed. In the one diseased
hunter who had long-term heart failure as a comorbidity, bilateral
pneumonia had been diagnosed. No laboratory test for tularemia had been
carried out. The other 9 are well after treatment. 9 of 10 of the affected
had taken part in gutting the hares. All killed hares seemed to be healthy;
no die-off or unusual behavior of hares in the region was observed. Frozen
meat from the hunt is [being tested]; a retrospective cohort study is not
finished yet.
