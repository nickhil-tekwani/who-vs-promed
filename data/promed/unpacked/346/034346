Epidemiological comments: The Santona and Noja Marshes Nature Reserve is considered to be an area at special risk for the introduction of avian influenza, according to Order APA/2442/2006. Since 11 Nov 2020, and given the epidemiological situation in Europe, it was decided not to allow competent authorities to make exceptions to the measures to be applied in this kind of area. These measures are: a) Using birds of Anseriformes and Charadriiformes Orders as decoys is prohibited. (b) Breeding ducks and geese with other species of poultry is prohibited. (c) Rearing free-range poultry is prohibited. (d) Giving poultry water from water reservoirs accessible to wild birds is prohibited, unless water can be treated to ensure inactivation of possible avian influenza viruses. (e) Outdoor water reservoirs required for poultry welfare will be sufficiently protected against wild waterfowl. f) Poultry or other captive birds are prohibited in animal assembly centers defined in Article 3.7 of Law 8/2003 of 24 Apr 2020 on animal health, including livestock shows, exhibitions and cultural celebrations, as well as any concentration of poultry or other captive birds outdoors. In this respect, birds kept in premises authorized for sale to private individuals as pet birds, and poultry kept in commercial premises for subsequent retail sale to private individuals, will not be considered captive birds.

Control measures
Measures applied: official disposal of carcasses, by-products, and waste; vaccination prohibited; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

["Several factors can contribute to the spread of avian influenza (AI) viruses, such as: globalisation and international trade; farming and sale (live bird markets); wild birds and migratory routes.

Wild birds can normally carry AI viruses in their respiratory or intestinal tracts, but they do not commonly get sick, which allow them to carry the viruses long distances along their migration flyways.

Wild birds, as natural hosts and reservoirs for all types of avian influenza viruses, play a major role in the evolution, maintenance, and spread of these viruses. The main wild species involved have proved to be waterfowl, gulls, and shorebirds; however, the virus seems to pass easily between different bird species.

The incidence of infection appears to be seasonal, with the highest isolation rate being in juvenile birds in the fall of the year.

Several routes of exposure of wild bird viruses to poultry have been documented or suspected of being the origins of outbreaks. Direct exposure to wild birds is the most likely transmission factor.

Therefore, limiting exposure of poultry to wild birds through confinement rearing and other biosecurity measures provides an opportunity to reduce the risk of introduction of avian influenza virus from wild birds, and consequently is key to decreasing the risk of evolution into highly pathogenic forms, exposure and infection of humans, and recombination with human viruses components to form viruses that can not only infect humans but readily transmit among humans;" Source: https://www.oie.int/en/animal-health-in-the-world/avian-influenza-portal/what-is-avian-influenza/.

The following abstract comes from a scientific article titled "Enterotropism of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N8 from the 2016/2017 epidemic in some wild bird species," which is available in ref. 1:

Abstract:
"In 2016/2017, H5N8 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus of the Goose/Guangdong lineage spread from Asia to Europe, causing the biggest and most widespread HPAI epidemic on record in wild and domestic birds in Europe. We hypothesized that the wide dissemination of the 2016 H5N8 virus resulted at least partly from a change in tissue tropism from the respiratory tract, as in older HPAIV viruses, to the intestinal tract, as in low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) viruses, allowing more efficient faecal-oral transmission. Therefore, we determined the tissue tropism and associated lesions in wild birds found dead during the 2016 H5N8 epidemic, as well as the pattern of attachment of 2016 H5N8 virus to respiratory and intestinal tissues of four key wild duck species. We found that, out of 39 H5N8-infected wild birds of 12 species, four species expressed virus antigen in both respiratory and intestinal epithelium, one species only in respiratory epithelium, and one species only in intestinal epithelium. Virus antigen expression was association with inflammation and necrosis in multiple tissues. The level of attachment to wild duck intestinal epithelia of 2016 H5N8 virus was comparable to that of LPAI H4N5 virus, and higher than that of 2005 H5N1 virus for 2 of the 4 duck species and chicken tested. Overall, these results indicate that 2016 H5N8 may have acquired a similar enterotropism to LPAI viruses, without having lost the respirotropism of older HPAI viruses of the Goose/Guangdong lineage. The increased enterotropism of 2016 H5N8 implies that this virus had an increased chance to persist long term in the wild waterbird reservoir."
