A young child in Western Australia [WA] is dead after contracting a virulent strain of meningococcal disease and another is also infected. The 2 children, both aged under 3, had contracted the serogroup W infection and one had since died, the state's health department said on [Mon 20 Nov 2017]. An adult from interstate [the same state? - Mod.SH] was also infected with another strain of the bacteria.

"There have now been 4 deaths from meningococcal disease in WA in 2017, all infected with the serogroup W type of the organism," a health department statement said. So far this year there have been 38 cases of the potentially deadly disease, up from 23 in 2016. "The numbers of serogroup W and Y cases are well above the long term average of less than one case per year of each of these types," the department said.

The children and adult are the latest cases of the disease in WA but none of the individuals are linked.

[Immunity following use of a meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine is specific for the type of capsular polysaccharide that the vaccine contains, with no cross-protection against infection due to other meningococcal polysaccharide groups.

Vaccines exist that contain capsular polysaccharide (A, C, Y, and W), either alone or conjugated to protein. Serogroup B vaccines are based upon meningococcal B protein antigens, because group B polysaccharide is poorly immunogenic in humans and is a potential auto-antigen.

Following the mass introduction into the population of a vaccine specific for one particular serogroup, the incidence of disease due to that serogroup has been found to fall dramatically. In Australia, following the introduction of the conjugate meningococcal C vaccine in 2003, there has been a significant and sustained reduction in serogroup C meningococcal cases from 34 per cent of cases in 2003 to 5.7 per cent in 2012, accompanied by an increase in serogroup B from 60 per cent in 2003 to 83 per cent in 2012 (http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/cda-cdi3703-pdf-cnt.htm/$FILE/cdi3703e.pdf). See ProMED-mail posts Meningitis, meningococcal - Australia (02): (SA) sg. B 20160515.4222568 and Meningitis, meningococcal - Australia: (SA) RFI 20160513.4220868.

ProMED-mail reported in 2016 that serogroup W, rather than B, has become predominant in Western Australia (ProMED-mail post Meningitis, meningococcal - Australia (03): (WA) sg. W 20160925.4513543).

Because of the replacement of serogroup C by serogroups W and B, meningococcal serogroup B and quadrivalent conjugate (ACWY) vaccines are now funded for certain age groups in some Australian states "in response to locally predominant meningococcal B or W disease" (http://www.ncirs.edu.au/assets/provider_resources/fact-sheets/meningococcal-vaccines-fact-sheet.pdf).

The quadrivalent (A, C, W, Y) meningococcal conjugate vaccines are available through private prescription and also through state-funded adolescent programs in 5 states (New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania, Queensland, and Western Australia) starting in 2017, for those aged 15-19 years or school years 10-12 (http://www.ncirs.edu.au/assets/provider_resources/fact-sheets/meningococcal-vaccines-fact-sheet.pdf). The B vaccine is available through private prescription and in South Australia from April 2017, in a statewide 2-year clinical study for students enrolled in years 10, 11, and 12 in 2017 at participating schools (http://www.ncirs.edu.au/assets/provider_resources/fact-sheets/meningococcal-vaccines-fact-sheet.pdf).

Western Australia, covering the entire western third of Australia, is mostly arid, its population being concentrated in the fertile south west corner and its capital, Perth (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia).
