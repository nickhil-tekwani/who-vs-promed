--------------------------------------------------------
As of Mon 19 Mar 2007, the Egyptian Ministry of Health and Population
has announced a new human case of avian influenza A(H5N1) virus
infection. The case was confirmed by the Egyptian Central Public
Health Laboratory and by the US Naval Medical Research Unit No.3 (NAMRU-3).
The 10-year-old girl from Aswan Governorate, was admitted to hospital
with symptoms on Tue 13 March and her condition remains stable.
Investigations indicate that she had recently been exposed to sick
poultry. Contacts of the girl are being kept under observation.
Of the 25 cases confirmed to date in Egypt, 13 have been fatal.

[2] 26th case reported

A 2-year-old Egyptian boy has tested positive for bird flu, bringing
the number of people who have contracted the disease in the most
populous Arab country to 26, the Health Ministry said on Monday [19 Mar 2007].
The Ministry said the boy was admitted to hospital on Friday [16 Mar
2007] in Aswan, the same southern city where a 10-year-old girl
tested positive for the disease last week (see part[1] above). She
has since recovered.
"He's in good condition now because Tamiflu was given within 24 hours
after the onset of symptoms," John Jabbour, a World Health
Organisation official in Cairo, told Reuters.
Jabbour said there was no apparent link between the 2 Aswan cases,
and the Health Ministry said in a statement that members of the boy's
family were under observation.
Since the virus first surfaced in Egyptian poultry in early 2006, 13
Egyptians have died from the disease. Most of those who fell ill were
reported to have had contact with sick or dead household birds,
primarily in northern Egypt. Egypt has the largest number of
confirmed human cases outside of Asia, and with 8 confirmed cases
this year, is among the hardest-hit countries worldwide for 2007. The
U.N. Food and Agriculture Organisation's (FAO) chief veterinary
officer Joseph Domenech said on Thursday [15 Mar 2007] that Egypt was
one of 3 countries that still do not have sufficient bird flu
controls in place.

[A significant feature of these apparently unrelated cases is that
the 2 patients are residents of Aswan in Lower Egypt, whereas the
majority of Egyptian cases have occurred in Upper Egypt. Although
Egypt now has the largest number of confirmed human cases outside of
Asia, mortality at 50 percent is much lower than the 77.8 percent
experienced in Indonesia and closer to the overall global 60.1 per
cent, possibly as a result of prompt resort to Tamiflu treatment.
