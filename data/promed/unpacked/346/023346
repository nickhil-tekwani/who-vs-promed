The Environmental Health Directorate has reported 2 new epizootics in

since the report of an earlier epizootic announced on 25 Nov 2004. The
surrounding municipalities have the following vaccination coverages:
Infante 70 percent, Chaguaramas 120 percent, Guayabal 136 percent, and
Miranda 50 percent. The Mellado Mnicipality has a vaccination coverage of
73 percent and the surrounding municipalities have the following coverages:

[Administrative figures are estimated coverages. These are calculated by
using the number of doses of vaccine administered as the numerator, and
using estimations of the total target populations. Among other
possibilities, reasons for observed vaccination coverages greater than 100
percent include underestimation of the target population, over-inclusion of
population vaccinated (including people from external geographic areas not
included in the denominator such as neighboring municipalities), and errors
in tabulations. - Mod.MPP]
