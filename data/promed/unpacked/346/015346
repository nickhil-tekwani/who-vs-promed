ANTHRAX, LIVESTOCK, WILDLIFE - CANADA, USA: UPDATE

Before the 2009 anthrax season started, US Navy field test kits were
widely and generously distributed to the veterinary authorities in the
Canadian Prairie Provinces (AB, SK, MB) and the adjoining US states
(MT, MN, ND, SD) as this region has a common ecology for this disease
and for its control and management, though details may vary. Awareness
information was sent to the relevant ranchers by their government
services. These states and provinces have suffered severe epidemics in
the past 5 years.

Preliminary returns [see below] indicate that rancher awareness and
herd vaccination are vital for the control of this disease in high
risk areas, as we all know. When used, the US Navy field test worked
as efficiently as expected and there were no false negatives. - Mod MHJ
