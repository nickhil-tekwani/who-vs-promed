The real reservoir for this 3-host tick is unlikely to be in domestic animals, I suspect. It is not at all fastidious about host species amongst mammals (almost irrespective of life cycle stage) and has also been reported infesting birds and reptiles. Domestic animals are reasonable sentinels for it, however, because people see them regularly.

I believe I have mentioned this previously, but it has consistently been the most frequent incidental detection by New Zealand biosecurity at border inspection -- hitch-hiking amongst back-packer camping gear, etc. Detected not on an animal numerous times. Main origin there has been Australia, probably because of comparative volume of people traffic with Australia relative to elsewhere.

The biotype may be of interest. One reproduces by conventional sexual means, whereas the most common one through the Pacific, Australia, and New Zealand reproduces primarily via parthenogenesis.

[The bush tick (_Haemaphysalis longicornis_) recently found in Virginia, after it was initially reported in the USA for the 1st time in New Jersey in November 2017, is of serious concern. It is not clear how this tick arrived in New Jersey and in Virginia, or if these 2 events are connected. As the report above indicates, this tick is a vector of important pathogens that infect people and domestic animals. One hopes that there will be intensified surveillance in the area in Virginia to find out if there are additional bush ticks in the area. Ticks can be extremely difficult to control, once established in an area. Presumably, the domestic animals in the location where the tick was found have been treated to eliminate ticks of this or any other species.

As David Thomson noted, it would be important to know the biotype of the ticks that have been found in Virginia and New Jersey.

Images of _Haemaphysalis longicornis_ can be seen at https://entomologytoday.org/2018/02/21/native-asia-found-new-jersey-curious-case-invasive-tick/ and https://openi.nlm.nih.gov/detailedresult.php?img=PMC3279682_kjp-49-419-g004&req=4 .

Many thanks to Prof. Michael J. Yabsley at the University of Georgia for providing correct image links.
