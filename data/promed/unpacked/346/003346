So far in 2021, 11 cases of hantavirus [infections] have been registered in Panama, of which 6 cases have been classified as hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HPS) and 5 cases as hantavirus fever (FH), reported the Department of Epidemiology of the Ministry of Health.

The regions that have [reported cases of HPS] have been the district of Tonosi, Los Santos province, which reports 3 cases, 1 case is registered in Parita, Herrera province, and 1 case in Chepo, Panama East region. At the same time, the 1st death in 2021 due to this condition was registered among the cases. This is a male person from the Aguadulce district, Cocle province. The report also details that, of these 6 cases of HPS, 3 correspond to males and 3 to females, in an age range between 18 and 55 years.

Of the 5 cases that have been classified as hantavirus fever (HF),) 4 cases come from the Tonosi district, Los Santos province and 1 case from Sona, Veraguas. The 5 cases are male, in an age range of 19 to 80 years.

[HPS] is a serious acute viral disease caused by a hantavirus. Cases of hantavirus infection in humans [in Panama] generally occur in rural areas (fields, farms, etc.), where rodents can be found harboring the virus, but transmission in urban areas is also possible. Infected people may experience headaches, dizziness, chills, fever, and myalgia, according to data provided on the website of the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO).

The Ministry of Health (MINSA), committed to the health of the Panamanian population, intensifies surveillance in the different points affected by hantavirus [infections], at the same time it calls on people to maintain cleanliness in their homes and eliminate elements that may attract rodents near them. The entity reports that this virus is acquired by inhalation of excrement, urine, and saliva of infected rodents.

[Hantavirus infections in the provinces and municipalities above are common events annually in these central provinces.

An earlier WHO report indicates that Choclo is the hantavirus identified in those cases, based on genomic sequence analysis (see Hantavirus - Americas (02): Panama WHO 2018 review 20190106.6245148).

Curiously, Choclo virus is never mentioned in the popular press reports that come to ProMED from Panama, including this one. It is reassuring to know that the virus responsible for the cases described in the WHO report above, or at least the ones for which samples and diagnostic testing were done, confirms the ProMED conclusion that Choclo virus was involved.

Earlier, Dr Jan Clement suggested that Seoul hantavirus might be involved in some of the cases in the Americas, including Panama. The rodent reservoir of Seoul virus is the ubiquitous brown rat (_Rattus norvegicus_). Presumably, genomic analysis by the Gorgas Lab would have detected this virus. Nonetheless, diagnostic laboratories should be aware of this possibility and look for it.

The rodent host of Choclo virus is the pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys fulvescens_), a photograph of which can be accessed at http://www.medwave.cl/medios/perspectivas/Hantavirus/Actualiz/Fig2.jpg. These rodents live in and around agricultural areas and adjacent houses and buildings. They can be persistently infected with the virus and shed it in urine, feces, and saliva, the source of human infection.

The report above does not indicate household measures that should be taken to prevent human exposure. A previous report stated that preventive measures recommended include:
- store grain in sacks and closed plastic containers, place them on pallets, and separated from the walls;
- place firewood, lumber, or any other useful materials distant from the house, in an arid, dry area and on pallets;
- drain residual water from patios and keep them clean;
- keep the kitchen area clean and utensils in covered containers, to avoid that they enter in contact with rodents;
- open doors and windows for 60 minutes before cleaning areas that have been closed for a long time;
- spray the floor with water [a 10% bleach solution is better to avoid raising dust [that may contain virus contaminated excrement from infected rodents. - Mod.TY
