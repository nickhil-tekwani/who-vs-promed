Confirmed cases of Zika virus in Singapore rose to 82 on [Tue 30 Aug 2016], as the United States joined a growing list of countries warning pregnant women or those trying to get pregnant to avoid travel to the city-state.

The mosquitoborne Zika virus, which has caused explosive outbreaks in the Americas and the Caribbean since late last year [2015], poses a particular risk to pregnant women because it can cause microcephaly, a severe birth defect in which babies are born with abnormally small heads and underdeveloped brains.

On [Tue 30 Aug 2016], the United States warned pregnant women not to travel to Singapore, joining Australia, Taiwan, and South Korea.

The warnings followed news that Zika transmission appears to be occurring outside of the original cluster, with at least 5 of 26 new cases confirmed late on [Tue 30 Aug 2016] detected in the Aljunied area in the southeast of Singapore, the health ministry and National Environment Agency (NEA) said in a joint statement.

Singapore has advised pregnant women to take a free Zika test if they showed any symptoms or if their partners tested positive. "This is regardless of whether they have been to Zika-affected areas," health officials said in a statement.

The outbreak and advisories come as the tourism industry in one of the world's busiest travel hubs already faces weak global economic growth. Singapore's Tourism Board said it was premature to consider any impact on the sector, adding it remained a "safe travel destination".

More than 55 million people pass through Singapore's Changi airport every year. In the 1st half of this year [2016], tourism arrivals topped 8 million, around 1 million more than a year earlier [2015].

Singapore reported its 1st case of locally-transmitted Zika at the weekend [27-28 Aug 2016], and the number of confirmed infections has risen steadily since then. At least 3 dozen patients have made a full recovery.

Neighboring Malaysia and Indonesia have stepped up protective measures, introducing thermal scanners at airports and border checkpoints with the island state. Such measures, however, will only identify symptomatic cases of Zika, but only one in 5 people have symptoms of the virus, which include fever, rash, joint pain, and pink eye.

Singapore residents responded to government calls to be vigilant and to take precautions against mosquito bites. Online retailer Lazada Singapore said sales of insect repellents jumped 5-fold in the past 3 days. FairPrice supermarkets and Watsons pharmacies said their sales of such products had doubled.

Most of the early infections were among foreign workers, hundreds of thousands of whom, mainly from the Asian sub-continent, work on Singapore's construction sites and in the marine sector. The Singapore government has not said where the infected foreign workers are from. The foreign ministry directed queries to the health ministry, which did not respond to Reuters questions on the issue. The Ministry of Manpower also did not respond to a request for comment made outside working hours.

The High Commission of Bangladesh, which represents the largest community of foreign workers, said none of those infected were Bangladeshis, and the Thai foreign ministry said none were from Thailand. The embassies of China, India, Sri Lanka, and Myanmar said they had not been notified by Singapore whether their citizens were among those infected.

Authorities inspected thousands of homes in 7 parts of Singapore, including 5 foreign worker dormitories, spraying insecticide, and removing potential mosquito breeding habitats. The NEA has inspected about 5000 premises in and around the initial outbreak area, issuing 400 notices to owners of buildings they could not access. The NEA can force entry into those premises if needed.

Zika was 1st discovered in Uganda in 1947. It caused clusters of human infections from the 1960s to 1980s across Africa and Asia, according to the World Health Organization. The outbreak in the Americas was caused by a Zika strain from Asia, possibly carried to Brazil through travel to a sporting event. Many experts believe once infected, Zika produces lifelong immunity. "Unfortunately, it is not clear the level of immunity that is currently in Asia," said Alessandro Vespignani of Northeastern University in Boston. WHO declared Zika a global health emergency because of its link with microcephaly. In Brazil, Zika has been linked to more than 1800 cases of microcephaly.

[Zika virus infection has similar clinical signs to dengue, and may be misdiagnosed in areas where dengue is common. There is no cure for Zika virus disease. Treatment is focused on relieving the symptoms. Prevention and control relies on reducing the breeding of aedes mosquitoes and minimizing contact between mosquito vectors and people by using barriers (such as repellents, insect screens), reducing water-filled habitats supporting mosquito larvae in and close to dwellings, and reducing the adult mosquito populations around at-risk communities.

Both _Ae. aegypti_ and _Ae. albopictus_ have been implicated in large outbreaks of Zika virus. _Ae. aegypti_ is confined to tropical and sub-tropical regions, while _Ae. albopictus_ can be found in tropical, sub-tropical and temperate regions. _Ae. albopictus_ has spread from Asia and become established in areas of the South Pacific, Africa, Europe, and the Americas in recent decades. In the South Pacific, _Ae. hensilli_ was implicated in the spread of Zika virus on Yap Island in 2007, while _Ae. polynesiensis_ was suspected to spread Zika virus in French Polynesia in 2013. Neither of these endemic species had been recognized as a Zika virus vector before, indicating that as this emerging disease spreads to previously unaffected countries, the potential exists for other endemic _Aedes_ species to play a role in transmission (http://www.wpro.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs_05182015_zika/en/).

[Autochthonous transmission of Zika in Singapore is not surprising given ongoing dengue transmission there. One wonders whether this new transmission is due to (re)-introduction of the virus from South America or represents ongoing transmission discovered because of heightened awareness and surveillance. - Mod.LM]
