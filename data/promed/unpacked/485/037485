Contract manufacturing organization PharmaTech on Monday [8 Aug 2016] announced a voluntary recall of all of its liquid drug formulations made at its Davie, Florida facility over a 10 month period after being linked to a multistate _Burkholderia cepacia_ outbreak.

The recall is an expansion of an earlier recall dated 15 Jul 2016, in which PharmaTech said it was recalling all lots of Diocto Liquid (docusate sodium), a stool softener distributed by Rugby Laboratories, after the company received reports that the drug was contaminated with _B. cepacia_.

So far, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says it has confirmed 60 cases of _B. cepacia_ infection in 8 states. While PharmaTech is the only company linked to the outbreak, CDC and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) say that doctors and patients should avoid using any brand of liquid docusate sodium until the outbreak is resolved.

According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), "_B. cepacia_ poses little medical risk to healthy people. However, people who have certain health problems like weakened immune systems or chronic lung diseases, particularly cystic fibrosis, may be more susceptible to infections." Also, CDC says the bacteria is known to be resistant to many common antibiotics, making infection more difficult to treat.

Now, as a precautionary measure, PharmaTech says it is expanding the recall to include all liquid drugs and dietary supplements produced at its Davie, FL facility between 20 Oct 2015 and 15 Jul 2016 distributed by Rugby Laboratories, Major, Bayshore, Centurion, Vitrus and Metron.

The recalled products include multiple lots of docusate sodium laxatives, cough syrup, antihistamines and sodium citrate-citric acid, which is used to treat reduce urine acidity for patients with gout and kidney stones. However, PharmaTech says it has not received any reports indicating contamination in the additional products listed in the expanded recall.

While the source of the contamination so far remains unclear, FDA investigators cleared PharmaTech's Davie, FL facility after a 10 day inspection that took place in February and March 2016. "The site was found to be compliant with the principles and guidelines of Current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP), and no Form 483 observations were issued," the company said in a press release following the inspection.

[The product recall concerns a multistate outbreak of _Burkholderia cepacia_ complex infections that have occurred primarily in mechanically ventilated patients without cystic fibrosis and who are being treated in intensive care units. The outbreak involves 60 confirmed cases of _B. cepacia_ infection in 8 states and is associated with use of oral liquid docusate suspected of being contaminated with _B. cepacia_. The news report above says that the current recall of all liquid drugs and dietary supplements produced at PharmaTech's facility in Davie, FL between 20 Oct 2015 and 15 Jul 2016 is an expansion of the original recall of all lots of Diocto Liquid (docusate sodium) on 15 Jul 2016. Docusate is a stool softener, used to treat or prevent constipation.

_B. cepacia_ complex is a group of related lactose-non fermenting, Gram negative bacterial species, some of which are capable of causing life-threatening respiratory tract infections in immunocompromised patients or patients with chronic lung diseases, particularly cystic fibrosis (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16217180). _B. cepacia_ is a water/soil organism that was formerly classified as _Pseudomonas cepacia_. _B. cepacia_ survives and multiplies in aqueous hospital environments and can contaminate certain antiseptic solutions such as quaternary ammonium salts, chlorhexidine, and iodine products. _B. cepacia_ are often resistant to common antibiotics.

In 2005, CDC was notified by several states of clusters of pneumonia and other infections caused by _B. cepacia_ and associated with contaminated mouthwash (https://www.cdc.gov/HAI/organisms/bCepacia.html). In 2004, CDC was notified of a voluntary recall of over-the-counter nasal spray due to contamination with _B. cepacia_ complex, and also in 2004, _B. cepacia_ was linked to nosocomial infections among intensive care unit patients and associated with exposure to sublingual probes (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5334a7.htm). - Mod.ML
