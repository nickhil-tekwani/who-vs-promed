Just 2 weeks ago, a group of 8 elk died in the Boise foothills after feeding on Japanese yew plants. This week, a herd of 50 pronghorn antelope [_Antilocapra americana_] have been found dead in the town of Payette, victims of the same toxic shrub.

The pronghorn were reported to Fish and Game staff early Tuesday afternoon, 17 Jan 2017; conservation officers located the 50 animals in one large scattered group later that day. The cause of death was not immediately evident, and 4 of the carcasses were transported to the Fish and Game Health Laboratory for evaluation.

Fish and Game wildlife veterinarian Dr. Mark Drew confirmed the cause of death on Wednesday [18 Jan 2017]. "All 4 animals were in good body condition but with congested lungs and kidneys," Drew noted. "All had Japanese yew twigs and needles in their esophagus and rumen; the cause of death was yew toxicity."

Earlier in the week, a larger herd of pronghorn bedded on an ice jam in the Snake River, crossing to the Idaho side on Monday [16 Jan 2017] near Centennial Park. They then moved south along the river towards Payette Pond. "There are a number of residences along this route where they may have encountered the shrub," Fish and Game conservation educator Evin Oneale said. "Like other big game species that graze on Japanese yew, they died quickly after ingesting the plant."

Japanese Yew or _Taxus cuspidata_ is a common landscaping shrub, despite the fact that its soft, waxy needles are fatal to a variety of species, including elk, moose, horses, dogs and even humans. In some locations, this year's [2017] winter weather is pushing big game animals into more urban neighborhoods increasing the likelihood that Japanese yew plants will be encountered.

Because of the risk to big game animals, the department urges homeowners to inventory their property and remove and landfill any Japanese yew that might be growing at their residence. Alternatively, the plants can be wrapped with burlap to prevent access by big game animals.

[It is interesting to note that there are 2 types of yew most prevalent in the USA. While it is only of academic interest, I wonder which one killed these animals. The article mentions one, but the prevalence of where the plants grow is slightly different.

There are commonly considered to be 2 species of yew in the United States: _Taxus baccata_ -- European yew -- and _Taxus cuspidate_ -- Japanese Yew -- a most common ornamental shrub in the US and Canada. Their natural distribution differs, slightly, although as garden/yard plants, this general distribution may not always hold true. Since the Christmas season has just past, and this plant is often used in making wreaths, it is possible that discarded wreaths may also have been the source of toxicity, although there were none reported in the area of the 50 carcasses.

Generally, while distribution is widespread due to cultivation in landscape architecture and design, the 2 different plants have slightly different natural ranges. Japanese and European yew are both imported species that have become well established in US as ornamental shrubs. Both grow as shrubs and never grow larger than 20 feet.

Thought to be the 2nd most toxic species: _Taxus brevifolia_ or western yew is generally located in the western US and Canada, ranging from California to Montana and to Alaska. It grows as an evergreen tree with drooping branches ranging in height from 15 to 75 feet.

_Taxus cannadensis_, American yew or ground hemlock, is generally located in the mid-western and northeast US, ranging from Kentucky to Minnesota and to Maine. It grows as a spreading shrub, ranging in height from 3 to 5 feet. Browsing by white-tailed deer is thought to have led to selection for spreading growth over the arboreal form (escape browsing below the snow pack).

Yews are one of the darkest green of all evergreen shrubs. Leaves are dark green dorsally and pale green to yellow-green ventrally), with a prominent mid-rib with an alternate arrangement, and they are stiff, flat to needle-like, 0.5-1 inch long. The fruit is a bright red, ovoid, fleshy, cupped berry (aril) which surrounds a single small brown seed.

The chemical composition of yew has hundreds of distinct molecules that have been isolated (mostly flaveniods and toxins):
Hydrocyanic (HCN) esters
Ephedrine
Taxol
Oil of yew
Taxines: Taxine A, B, C
Others: taxicatin, taxicin I and II, taxiphyllin, taxiresinol, iso-taxiresinol, taxusin, taxinine A, B, E, H, J, K, and L, anhydrotaxininol

Oil of yew is found in the sap of the yew. It is an intestinal irritant responsible for colic and diarrhea signs of yew poisoning.

Taxines are non-irritating, diternepoid alkaloids. Taxine A and B are most the most common alkaloids (taxine B being the most abundant) and are regarded as being responsible for deaths from yew. The taxines are found in all parts of the plant except the aril.

Yews are toxic to all animals to varying degrees. White-tail deer and certain seed eating birds are much less susceptible. Yews are toxic all year round. Yews are more toxic later in the year due to a buildup of toxins. Most cases of yew poisoning are seen later in the year because of the scarcity of food and enhanced plant toxicity.

Yew is always poisonous. Fresh and dried yew are both toxic. Yew eaten directly from the plant is as toxic as yew clippings are. The health of the plant does not seem to significantly reduce toxicity (green yew is as toxic as brown yew).

Yew Poisoning & Treatment
Two Syndromes associated with Yew Poisoning (both caused primarily by taxine A and B)

Acute Syndrome
- Signs Death.
- Animals are frequently found dead next to yew bushes
- Death usually follows 1 to 3 hours after ingestion
- Onset of acute syndrome is rapid
- Animal will appear normal, then unexpectedly gasp a few times and die
- Cause of death is cardiac arrhythmia
- Taxine acts as a cardio-depressant
- Taxine inhibits sodium and calcium currents, blocking myocardial conduction
- Heart suddenly stops in diastole

Subacute Syndrome
- Signs
- Ataxia, diarrhea, hypotension, colic, hypothermia, coma, seizures, weakness, respiratory failure, bradycardia and sudden death
- Animals (usually cattle, or antelope in this case) die within 24 to 48 hours after ingestion
- Survival without treatment is possible but occurs infrequently to rarely, especially in large animals.

Severity of yew poisoning depends on:
- Health status of animals. Sick animals seem to be more susceptible to acute syndrome
- Age of animals. Young animals are more prone to acute syndrome.
- Amount of yew consumed. The more yew that is eaten, the more severe the poisoning is.
- Type of animal poisoned. Monogastrics are more susceptible to acute syndrome. Monogastrics are most often thought of as dogs, cats, and humans, although there are others.
- English yew is lethal to ruminants at around 0.5 percent of the animal's body weight.
- English yew is lethal to monogastrics at around 0.1 percent of the animal's body weight.

Diagnosis - Finding fragments of yew leaves and twigs in the mouth, stomach and intestines
In cases where no yew detritus is found in the gastro-intestinal tract, diagnosis of yew poisoning may be determined by GC/MS of stomach or rumen.

Necropsy: No pathogenic lesions
- Exception: In cases of animals dying subacutely, there is a mild inflammation of the upper intestinal tract.
- Inflammation is due to the action of the irritant oil of yew.
- In grams per pound body weight:
- Horse 0.9 grams per pound of body weight
- Ox 4.5
- Sheep 4.5
- Goats 5.5
- Pigs 1.4
- Total Fatal Doses (in grams):
- Horse 100-200
- Ox ca. 500
- Pig 75
- Dog 30
- Fowl 30

Treatment of yew poisoning
No treatment for acute syndrome
- Aggressive decontamination of stomach using activated charcoal and a cathartic (MgSO4)
- Rumenotomy and removal of rumen contents
- Administration of atropine sulfate to counteract bradycardia
- Problem: atropine slows gastrointestinal peristalsis and prolongs the elimination of the ingested toxic plant. Therefore, treatment with atropine, but must be done judiciously.
