As of yesterday, 11 people have tested positive for _E. coli_ (0157:H7)
poisoning in the Star Valley area, according to Don Rolston, director of
the Wyoming Department of Health. However, everyone confirmed to have the
infection had onset between June 28-July 3, indicating there is no
continuing source of contamination. A total of 48 people displayed
symptoms of the infection and the additional cases are still under
investigation. Four of the 11 individuals required hospitalization,
including a 2-year old and a 9-year old.
Officials in Alpine, Wyoming have no clue about the source of the bacteria,
but are looking at the water supply. Water from Mill Spring, one of two
municipal water sources for Alpine, is being tested. So far, the water
samples have turned up negative. The water is not routinely chlorinated
according to the Wyoming Department of Health.
