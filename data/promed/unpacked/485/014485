Total number of wild poliovirus cases in 2017: 22

New cVDPV cases reported this week: 1
Total number of cVDPV cases in 2018: 15
Total number of cVDPV cases in 2017: 96

Headlines
- The minister of health of Papua New Guinea officially launched the outbreak response campaign on 16 Jul 2018 in Morobe, Madang, and Eastern Highlands provinces.

Summary of new viruses this week:
- Afghanistan: advance notification of 1 wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) case in Kunar province.
- Nigeria: 1 new case of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) as well as 3 confirmed and 2 advanced notice cVDPV2 positive environmental samples.

Afghanistan
- There is advance notification of 1 wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) case in Chawkay district, Kunar province. The case has onset of paralysis on [22 Jun 2018]. Once confirmed (officially to be reflected in next week's data), this will bring the total number of WPV1 cases in 2018 (in Afghanistan) to 10.
- Preparations for the August [2018] national immunization activity are under way.

Pakistan
- No new cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) were reported this week.
- The total number of officially reported WPV1 cases in Pakistan in 2018 is 3.
- The latest case had onset of paralysis on 18 May [2018], from Dukki district, Balochistan province.

Nigeria
- No new cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) were reported in the past week.
- 4 WPV1 cases were reported in Nigeria in 2016 and no cases have been reported in 2017 or 2018. The most recent WPV1 case (by date of onset) was reported in Monguno local government area [LGA], Borno state, with onset on [21 Aug 2016].
- One new case of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) from Geidam LGA in Yobe state has been confirmed. The case has onset of paralysis on [16 Jun 2018]. This is the 2nd cVDPV2 case in Nigeria this year [2018] after the one reported from Jigawa state, Kaugama LGA on [15 Apr 2018]. As part of the outbreak response, 2 campaigns using monovalent vaccine type 2 are planned, subject to review from the advisory group. In addition, 3 confirmed [Sokoto (2) and Yobe 1] and 2 advanced notice (Sokoto) cVDPV2 positive environmental samples are being reported from May [2018].
- In response to cVDPV2 detection, the country has conducted additional acute flaccid paralysis surveillance strengthening activities including enhanced active surveillance visits and community sampling. The programme has also carried out an extensive search for type 2 containing vaccines (tOPV/mOPV2) in the areas surrounding where the virus was detected.
- The GPEI is working with regional and country counterparts and partners to support an outbreak response and plan the October [2018] sub-national immunization activity.

Lake Chad Basin
- The detection of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) in Nigeria continue to pose a risk to the neighbouring countries of the Lake Chad basin.
- Emergency outbreak response efforts continue across the Lake Chad basin, together with activities to fill subnational surveillance gaps across the region.
- These include efforts to vaccinate children at markets, in internally displaced persons and refugee camps, and at international borders.
- Preparations continue for the cross-border synchronized immunization activity in October [2018].

Central Africa
- No new cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) were reported in the past week in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).
- The country is affected by 3 separate strains of cVDPV2, in the provinces of Mongola, Maniema, and Haut Lomami/Tanganika/Haut Katanga/Ituri.
- The total number of cVDPV2 cases reported in the DRC in 2018 is 7.
- The geographic extent of the outbreak response to all 3 strains is being re-evaluated, given the confirmed spread of one of the strains to Ituri and confirmation of the 3rd strain in Mongola. The risk of further spread is magnified given the proximity of Ituri to Uganda, and known population movements between affected areas.
- The Ministry of Health, supported by WHO and partners of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative, remains fully committed to outbreak response in the affected provinces, including use of monovalent oral polio vaccine type 2 (mOPV2) across the country, in line with internationally-agreed outbreak response protocols.

Horn of Africa
- The Horn of Africa is currently affected by separate outbreaks of cVDPV2 and cVDPV3, reporting both cases and environmental positives.
- Somalia is reporting a total of 4 cases in 2018: 1 cVDPV2, 2 cVDPV3, and 1 cVDPV2&3 with date of onset of most recent one on 23 May 2018.
- Outbreak response to both strains is currently being implemented in line with internationally-agreed guidelines. Large-scale supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) have been implemented in Banadir, Lower Shabelle, and Middle Shabelle regions, Somalia, with additional SIAs planned or carried out in the affected zones of the Horn of Africa. Special surveillance activities are being undertaken to determine the origin of the viral circulation.
- WHO and partners continue to support local public health authorities across the Horn of Africa in conducting field investigations and risk assessments.

Middle East
- No new cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) were reported in the past week in Syria.
- The total number of officially reported cVDPV2 cases in Syria in 2017 remains 74. There are no cases reported in 2018.
- The most recent case (by date of onset) was reported in Boukamal district, with onset on [21 Sep 2017].
- In an effort to heighten population immunity against type-2 among high risk populations, more than 5000 children aged 2-23 months have received inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) in newly accessible areas of eastern Ghouta. In addition, a total of 33 836 children under 5 years of age have received bivalent oral polio vaccine (bOPV). 23 vaccination teams were deployed between March and May 2018 through fixed centres and mobile clinics that also provided other routine immunization.
- WHO has supported further upgrades to the Syrian National Polio Laboratory, to improve poliovirus diagnostic capacity. 7 national technical staff were trained on intratypic differentiation of poliovirus samples, which will allow for more comprehensive testing and faster identification of results.
- All empty and expired unopened vials of monovalent oral polio vaccine type-2 (mOPV2) have been destroyed according to global guidelines, under the direct supervision of WHO staff in country.

Papua New Guinea
- Papua New Guinea officially launched the outbreak response campaign on [16 Jul 2016] in Morobe, Madang, and Eastern Highlands provinces. 3 more campaigns are planned for August, September, and October [2018].
- On [26 Jun 2018], the Papua New Guinea Government declared the circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (cVDPV1) outbreak in Morobe province a National Public Health Emergency.
- One case of cVDPV1 and 2 cVDPV1 community contacts were reported in Lae, Morobe province. The case had onset of paralysis on [24 Apr 2018].
- The National Department of Health (NDOH) is closely working with GPEI partners to launch a comprehensive response. The NDOH activated the National Emergency Operations Centre for the polio outbreak on [27 Jun 2018].
- Mop-up vaccination has taken place in Morobe and Eastern Highlands provinces with bivalent oral polio vaccine (bOPV).
- Intensified surveillance measures to improve detection of acute flaccid paralysis and poliovirus are being implemented in 6 provinces and the National Capital District, with on-the-ground training for provincial and district staff being provided by NDOH and WHO.

[My thought process in commenting on the state of the polio eradication effort is one of "good news" and "not so good news". In this current weekly update the good news includes no mention of newly confirmed cases of WPV1 associated disease in Pakistan and no mention of newly isolated WPV1 in environmental samples in Pakistan. It also includes the continued absence of newly confirmed cases of cVDPV2 in Syria and of cVDPV1 in Papua New Guinea. And a very cautious absence of newly confirmed cases of cVDPV in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and in Somalia.

The not so good news includes the advanced notification of confirmation of a WPV1 case in Kandar Afghanistan and the confirmation of a cVDPV2 associated case in Yobe State, Nigeria (Yobe state Nigeria is the western neighbor of Borno state see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Nigeria_states_map) as well as the advanced notifications of cVDPV2 positive environmental samples from Yobe and Sokoto states, indicating continued circulation of these cVDPV2 in northern Nigeria, and of WPV1 in Afghanistan.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
After the declaration of eradication of wild poliovirus type 2 in 2015, all countries using oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) switched from using trivalent OPV (tOPV) (containing vaccine virus types 1, 2, and 3) to bivalent OPV (bOPV) (containing types 1 and 3) in April 2016 (1). Vaccine-derived polioviruses (VDPVs), strains that have diverged from the live vaccine virus during prolonged circulation, can emerge rarely in areas with inadequate OPV coverage and can cause outbreaks of paralysis. Before the global switch from tOPV to bOPV, many circulating VDPV (cVDPV) outbreaks identified globally were caused by type 2 cVDPV (cVDPV2). After the switch, 2 large cVDPV2 outbreaks occurred in 2017 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (continuing in 2018) and Syria (2,3).

Somalia, Kenya, and Ethiopia make up much of the Horn of Africa. Performance indicators for acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) surveillance, an indicator of the sensitivity of surveillance to detect a case of polio, indicate some subnational gaps in these countries, including in areas of Somalia that are inaccessible for polio vaccination activities (4,5). 16 environmental poliovirus surveillance (sewage sampling) sites have been established in these countries to supplement AFP surveillance (Figure [available at the source URL above]).

Decades of civil unrest and protracted conflict in Somalia have weakened the country's governance and health care infrastructure, and routine vaccination coverage is estimated to be less than 50 per cent. Several areas in Somalia are controlled by antigovernment elements that ban vaccination services, leaving approximately 500 000 children aged less than 5 years unvaccinated (4,5). Approximately 2 million Somalis are internally displaced or living as refugees in neighboring countries; immunization services might not be effectively extended to a large proportion of displaced and refugee children.

In October 2017, a VDPV2 isolate was detected from a sewage sample collected from 1 of 4 environmental surveillance sites in Banadir, Somalia. The isolate differed from the parental Sabin 2 strain by 38 nucleotides in the VP1 coding region, indicating undetected circulation for greater than 3 years. Genetically related VDPV2 isolates were detected in November 2017 in a sewage sample from the same site. Subsequent detection of genetically related VDPV2 isolates from sewage samples collected in January 2018 from a 2nd site in Banadir confirmed cVDPV2 transmission.

Two response vaccination campaigns using monovalent OPV type 2 (mOPV2) were conducted in December 2017 and January 2018, targeting children aged less than 5 years in Banadir and the neighboring provinces of Middle Shabelle and Lower Shabelle (Figure [at source URL above]); no vaccination was possible in inaccessible areas within these provinces. After detection of a genetically related VDPV2 isolate from a sewage sample collected in February 2018 from a 3rd site in Banadir, a 3rd mOPV2 vaccination campaign was conducted in these same provinces in early May 2018. VDPV2 has not been detected from the 4th sampling site in Banadir.

In March 2018, a VDPV2 isolate differing by 47 nucleotides from the parental Sabin 2 strain was detected in a sewage sample collected in Kamukunji, Nairobi county, in neighboring Kenya. The isolate was genetically linked to the cVDVP2 isolates detected in Banadir (18-25 nucleotide changes), indicating independent circulation of the Banadir and Nairobi VDPV2 lineages for greater than 1 year. VDPV2 has not been detected from samples collected from the other 3 environmental surveillance sites in Nairobi or from sites in other cities in Kenya, although sample collection was irregular. VDPV2 has not been detected from any of the 3 environmental surveillance sites in Ethiopia. A limited mOPV2 response vaccination campaign was conducted in Nairobi in May 2018, and two synchronized mOPV2 rounds are scheduled for July and August 2018 in southern and central Somalia, eastern Kenya (including Nairobi), and eastern Ethiopia.

In April 2018, cVDPV type 3 (cVDPV3) isolates (15-17 nucleotide differences from parental Sabin 3 strain) were detected in environmental samples from two sites in Banadir province. In May 2018, cVDPV3 related to the April [2018] sewage isolate was identified in stool specimens from 2 AFP cases in Middle Shabelle province and 1 AFP case in Hiran province (in which the patient had a coinfection with cVDPV2). A bOPV response vaccination campaign is planned for the southern and central provinces of Somalia. AFP surveillance has been intensified in all 3 countries through active case finding at health facilities and other reporting sites. This increased surveillance is aimed at closing the gaps in AFP surveillance in all three countries. Further field investigations are ongoing.

[The report above highlights the challenges facing the goal of polio eradication in the face of persistent zones of civil unrest, where vaccinations are not readily available, nor is acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) surveillance up to par. Genetic data on the viruses isolated from sewage samples demonstrate that there have been cVDPVs being transmitted in the Horn of Africa, undetected for more than 3 years. This further reinforces my sense that declaration of a polio free status in an area after 3 years have passed without virus isolation may well be risky.

The good news is that the isolation of a virus in Nairobi that is related to viruses in Somalia, was only found in one sampling location, suggesting the virus may have recently been imported into Nairobi, although genetically the virus has been circulating undetected for more than 1 year.

Parents in Nairobi county have reported severe reactions exhibited by their infants who have received the new polio vaccine being administered by health workers in 12 counties. Children have been reported to experience diarrhoea and vomiting that has pushed many parents to rush to hospital fearing the worst.

A parent who spoke to Citizen TV, reported that her child exhibited the alarming symptoms soon after the vaccine was issued. Other concerned parents took to social media to share their experiences.

Director of medical services Dr Jackson Kioko, however, assured parents that despite the side effects being confirmed, they are only as a result of the vaccine. Dr Kioko explained that the Ministry of Health (MoH) had chosen to use a "bivalent" (in pairs) form of the vaccine and not the usual "trivalent" (in triples) form they have administered in the past. "Any new vaccine used will always have adverse effects and have a certain level of risks" he noted. The switch to bivalent vaccines is part of a global shift that was recommended by the United Nation's World Health Organization (WHO).

The doctor further alerted parents that the cause for worry would only be if any unexpected symptoms persisted for more than 10 days. At that point, he advised, the parents to seek immediate medical assistance.

The polio vaccination drive was launched by the Ministry of Health targetting 2 416 751 children aged 5 years and below in Garissa, Isiolo, Kajiado, Kiambu, Kitui, Machakos, Mandera, Meru, Nairobi, Tana River, Lamu, and Wajir. A 2nd phase of the effort to "kick polio out of Kenya" will kick off in August [2018].

[It is disconcerting whenever there are reports of side effects following receipt of vaccine, especially during campaign activities. What is unclear in the report above is whether the occurrence of these post vaccination symptoms is a new occurrence, or if it is an increase in occurrence over previously seen events, or if this is "hyping" of events supported by possible "anti-vaccer" groups to discredit/interrupt vaccination activities. The description of the events (having read a social media post available at the source URL) "included fever, vomiting, and diarrhea, with onset of vomiting same day as vaccine receipt. As there is no information provided on the numbers of cases reported, it is very difficult to assess the actual situation other than to express concern of potential damage to the ongoing vaccination activities. More information on this from knowledgeable sources would be greatly appreciated. - Mod.MPP]

The move to end polio started in 1985 with Rotary International. At that time, polio paralyzed hundreds of thousands of children every year. There is still no cure, but 2 scientists developed vaccines against the virus in the 1950s. Dr Jonas Salk produced one with an inactivated virus that could protect against polio without spreading the disease. Later, Dr Albert Sabin developed an oral vaccine with weakened strains of the virus.

In 1988, public and private groups joined the effort in the Global Polio Eradication Program. Members included governments, the World Health Organization, the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), Rotary International, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

Since then, the number of polio cases has dropped by 99.9 per cent. Last year [2017], 22 children were crippled by this disease. The wild polio virus exists in only 3 countries: Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Nigeria, but it's still a global threat.

Dr John Vertefeuille, from CDC said, "This last mile is a complicated mile." It's not just because of conflict or terrorism. "It's extreme remoteness. It's very fragile health systems." And in these remote conflict prone areas gaining access to children can be a major problem. If polio exists anywhere, it can once again spread everywhere.

Vertefeuille and other experts discussed strategies to realize a polio-free world [10 Jul 2018] at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. Widespread unrest in Afghanistan has kept thousands of children from receiving polio vaccines this year [2018]. Conflict in northern Nigeria does the same. What's more, the border between Afghanistan and Pakistan stretches for more than 2000 kilometers [about 1250 miles]. Thousands of people who cross this very porous border can easily transmit the virus in both countries.

While the funding and technical support has to come from large, private-public partnerships, immunization teams succeed best if they are local. Approaches have to take culture and customs into consideration. In many places the vaccinators are women because women can go into the homes, talk to other women and gain access to the children. Elsewhere, soldiers vaccinate children when they take over an area run by anti-government forces. Vaccination teams have to be prepared to move quickly when there is a lull in the fighting and to deliver multiple doses of vaccine in a short period of time.

Surveillance is just as critical. To end polio, you have to know where the outbreaks are. Community volunteers are a great resource. Some get cell phones so they can alert health officials if a child becomes paralyzed.

Another challenge is getting children in migrant groups vaccinated. Vertefeuille says this is where technology helps. CDC uses satellites to see where people have moved and what areas are abandoned. Clues are where structures have been repaired, where the grass grows on roads, indicating abandoned areas, and where it doesn't, indicating where people are living.

Dr Andrew Etsana from the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said these groups present a particular challenge because "you have people moving with a virus and it is difficult to track them and vaccinate the vulnerable children in this mobile population."

Another issue is the nature of viruses themselves. Viruses mutate. So far, the polio vaccines have been effective, but if not enough children get vaccinated, the virus can change, and perhaps make the vaccine less effective. That's why every child needs to be vaccinated.

Outbreaks can be avoided by vaccinating the whole population so that there are no gaps for the mutated virus to slip through. International experts are working with local leaders to close this gap.

Another issue is complacency. Etsana said, "People are getting tired. The program has been going on. They thought it would have ended."

Rotary has pledged to continue its support, other groups as well. International support and funding is critical to ending polio, but after three decades, many people have never seen polio. Etsana says he sees complacency creeping into all areas of the program. "The funders of the program are also getting tired. The fund is drying up and if the fund dries up and the job is not done, we're going to have a major problem. We may have reinfection."

But, if people recognize the program's value -- it has united communities, established vaccine centers, created partnerships never before imagined -- the world can not only end polio, but tackle other diseases as well. The polio program is widely credited with stopping the spread of Ebola in Nigeria while the disease ravaged other west African countries.

[The occurrence of both funder fatigue and vaccination worker fatigue is a worrisome outcome of many years of polio campaign activities towards the so near but yet so far goal of eradication of polio in the world. I suspect that such fatigue has contributed to the lowered vaccination coverages in areas that have been declared polio free in the recent as well as distant past since polio eradication has been underway. Tangentially, I remember in 1985, after 5 years of mass vaccination campaigns to control polio in Brazil, there was delayed recognition of a major polio epidemic in the country, not unrelated to the health sector feeling that an acute flaccid paralysis illness could not be polio, since "everyone" had been vaccinated and therefore it couldn't be polio. A popular alternative diagnosis was GBS [Guillain-Barre syndrome] but other more creative diagnoses included "post traumatic paralysis" (when the child had fallen because of the lower extremity paralysis). And evaluation of surrounding areas where cases came from included "pockets" of unvaccinated children supporting the transmission of the WPV.

The challenge is to maintain the high level of commitment on the part of the vaccinators, the clinicians, and the funders until the world can be declared totally free of poliovirus transmission (both WPV as well as circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus free). - Mod.MPP]
