The extensive South Australian pilchard kill has reached Victorian and
Western Australian waters, with fishery experts warning it could spread as
far as the Queensland border. Fisheries officials said dead pilchards had
been washed up as far east as Anglesea in Victoria and as far west as Eucla
in Western Australia, six weeks after the fish kill began in South
Australia's Spencer Gulf.
Victoria took immediate action over the pilchard kill today, with fisheries
director Richard McLoughlin announcing a voluntary closure on pilchard
fishing in that state. "The state has only three or four commercial
fishermen who fish for pilchards and following contact by Fisheries
Victoria they have agreed to a voluntary closure of the fishery until a
fisheries notice, closing the fishery, can be put in place," Mr McLoughlin
said.
Speaking after a meeting of fish experts in Adelaide, SA Fisheries director
Gary Morgan warned the herpes virus, which had killed about 20,000 tonnes
of pilchards so far, could spread further to the Queensland border. "In
1995 it spread from the NSW-Queensland border all the way around to the
west coast of Western Australia, which is essentially the entire range of
pilchards in Australia," he said. "I can't see any reason why it wouldn't
continue in the same way this time."
Dr Morgan said the kill had probably reached its peak in SA, but he
expected both Victoria and WA would be heavily affected by the virus. He
said fisheries departments would consider implementing quota levels for
pilchard fishing amid concerns the second pilchard kill in three years
could decimate the species.
Experts are now working on developing antibodies for the virus, which could
be used to test for the virus in other animals.
Scientists suspect that the herpes-like virus responsible for the death of
the pilchards might also be to blame for the death of sea dragons on
Kangaroo Island, south of Adelaide. Meanwhile, SA Marine and Coastal
Community Network state director Tony Flaherty said a number of leafy and
weedy sea dragons and a large amount of shrimp which the sea dragons fed on
had been reported dead along the Kangaroo Island and SA coasts. He said
tests would determine whether the sea dragons and shrimp died from natural
causes or as a result of the pilchard virus.
However, Dr Morgan said it was unlikely the virus would transfer to other
species.

[We await an official update from Dr Murray, as promised. At the moment we
have only what the press is saying so far this time. "Decimated" strictly
used means a 10% loss. The reality may be better or worse. As to this virus
having direct (i.e. infection) or indirect (e.g., starvation) or zero
impact on the sea dragons, we must await the results from Tony Flaherty's
people. - Mod.MHJ
