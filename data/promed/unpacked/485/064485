The Supreme Council of Health (SCH) has registered a new case of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV). The case is a 48-year-old expatriate.

The 48-year-old man suffers from chronic diseases and is receiving treatment at the intensive care unit, the SCH said in a press statement, adding that all the patient's family members and others were checked up and the initial results were negative.

The SEC also announced the recovery of another expatriate who had recently contracted the disease.

Qatari health officials today [8 Nov 2013] announced a Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection in a 48-year-old citizen, according to a report from the Kuwait News Agency (KUNA).

The Qatar Supreme Council of Health said the man has underlying health conditions and that tests on his close contacts have so far been negative, the report said. No other details were available about the case, which is the 8th one reported in Qatar.

The council also said another Qatari man who was recently diagnosed with MERS-CoV has recovered.

The latest case would raise the global MERS-CoV total to 155 cases, including 64 deaths.

[The case above represents the 155th laboratory confirmed case (including 64 deaths) of MERS-CoV infection globally and the 8th such case reported by Qatar. The media report in [1] mentions that the new case is in an expatriate, but does not mention country of origin and possible travel history prior to onset of illness. The same report refers to "another expatriate" case but does not clarify which case or whether there had been travel prior to onset of illness either. Presumably this report refers to the case announced in ProMED-mail MERS-CoV - Eastern Mediterranean (77): Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Oman, WHO 20131030.2027026. More information on the epidemiologic investigation surrounding these cases would be greatly appreciated.
