A barely one month old infant started crying all the time, not wanting to eat. When he developed a fever, he was quickly admitted to an intensive care unit. His spinal fluid was infected with bacteria, and it was spreading to his brain. The doctors believed it had probably come from his infant formula.

"Initially, doctors were worried he wasn't going to make it," said the mother, 23, who lives in Texas. The baby underwent the first of several operations on his brain to control escalating seizures and swelling, and when he could no longer breathe on his own, they put him on a ventilator for 21 days. Eventually, part of his brain had to be removed.

Her son, she learned, had been exposed to _Cronobacter sakazakii_, a [potentially] deadly bacterium that is often linked to babies who consume powdered formula and can cause serious brain damage, developmental disabilities and death. Health officials analyzed 2 open cans of formula from the mother's home; one tested negative and the other did not have enough product left to test.

The infant fell ill in [August 2019], more than 2 years before similar infections in 4 babies, 2 of them fatal, triggered a voluntary recall at an Abbott Nutrition plant in Sturgis, MI, that manufactured formula consumed by the latest sickened babies. The recall helped lead the way to a nationwide shortage of infant formula that has left parents struggling to feed their children; the Biden administration has responded by working with Abbott to restart production and flying in additional supplies from Europe.

As with this infant's illness, no link was established between infections in the 4 recent sick babies and production at any Abbott Nutrition plant. But while most of the attention has been focused on fixing the dire supply shortfall, regulators are confronting deeper issues of safety that persist in the manufacturing of powdered infant formula. There is no comprehensive mechanism for detecting or investigating _Cronobacter_ infections, and only one state, Minnesota, requires doctors and laboratories to report cases to the authorities. Manufacturers are left to conduct tests themselves on a relatively small sample of their production, with less than 1% of the Abbott plant's total output required to be tested. The combination of blind spots makes it difficult to trace infections to their source and could leave families at risk of future shutdowns and infant fatalities.

The Sturgis plant has had troubles going back to [2010], when beetle parts in formula triggered another recall. In recent years, inspection reports show, federal inspectors found standing water in manufacturing areas, a fan loaded with dust and debris positioned near a formula drying area and sanitary zones that were not cordoned off.

In October 2021, a whistle-blower complaint from a former Sturgis quality assurance worker landed with the FDA. He claimed that, in 2019, the plant did not destroy an entire batch of formula where problematic micro-organisms had been found because "senior management was under significant pressure to meet its 'numbers'"; and that the company was "sanitizing" files before providing them to FDA auditors, failing to disclose details about micro-organisms it found.

Abbott has said that no _Cronobacter_ samples from the 4 sick babies matched ones found at the Sturgis plant. An opened container of formula consumed by one of the babies had tested positive for 2 strains of _Cronobacter_, the company said, but those strains also did not match any that were found at the plant, and one matched a sample found on a water bottle that had been used to mix the formula. "The formula from this plant did not cause these infant illnesses," the company said.

Abbott has said that the former employee who filed the whistle-blower complaint was fired for violating its food safety policies and that he has made "evolving, new and escalating" claims since then. The company said it expected to be able to address all of the FDA's concerns by the time it reopens the Sturgis plant within the next 2 weeks. A consent decree the company signed with the government provides a series of new safeguards, including hiring a qualified expert to oversee improvements at the plant and notifying the FDA if it finds any contamination. Samples of _Cronobacter_ and _Salmonella_ found must be stored for 3 years. "We are confident that we can continue to produce safe, high-quality infant formula at all of our facilities as we have been doing for millions of babies around the world for decades," Abbott said.

The lack of testing and public reporting makes it difficult to know how many people are infected with _Cronobacter_. One study estimated about 18 cases per year in American infants, according to Dr. Julia Haston, an official with the CDC. Outcomes are usually severe, she said, and up to 40% of infants who go on to get bacterial meningitis, a frequent complication, die from the infection.

_Cronobacter_ is common in dirt and water. That means it is not an unusual bug to find in homes, much less in food processing plants. But there are only a few ways it is likely to get into an infant's body, researchers say. "It's not falling from the ceiling," said Dr. Janine Jason, a specialist in infectious diseases who worked at the CDC for 23 years. "Where we know it grows well is powdered formula. It's one of the few organisms that can survive in powdered milk or food." A CDC study said powdered formula "has been identified as the transmission vehicle in nearly all _Cronobacter_ infections for which a source was found."

The relatively low rate of testing makes it difficult to provide a positive link between illnesses and contamination at a particular plant. The fact that there was not a genetic match between the bacteria found in a sick infant and bacteria found at a plant might be because the contamination occurred in the home, in a batch that was not tested or in a portion of a sample that was not analyzed. "It's like reaching into a big box of Legos, pulling out a few and saying that proves there are no blue Legos in the box," said a lawyer who is representing families in a lawsuit against Abbott.

The Sturgis plant has had a history of regulatory issues with the FDA. The [2010] recall over beetle contamination came as an FDA inspection noted the company's 3-year battle with warehouse and flour beetles. Before and after that recall, the FDA was pushing the industry to test its products for _Cronobacter_, spurred by a cluster of cases in a Tennessee neonatal intensive care unit that was linked to contaminated powdered formula from another company.

In [1996], the FDA kicked off what would be an 18-year effort to institute tougher industry standards. When _Cronobacter- testing requirements were added in [2003], an industry group representing Abbott and other companies pushed back. It argued that, while it made sense to test for the bacterium in formula meant for premature babies, it was unnecessary to do so in formula marketed toward healthy babies because they were not at risk. Abbott said the trade group's position did not align with its own practices, which included voluntary testing for _Cronobacter_.

The FDA held its ground, and in [2014] began requiring infant formula makers to take 30 samples, each the weight of about 2 nickels, from every lot of formula and test them for _Cronobacter_. But the regulations did not define the size of a lot. Some factories have lot sizes of about 30 000 pounds. For Abbott, lots can reach 300 000 pounds, said Scott Donnelly, a former food product safety director who has testified as a witness for a plaintiff suing Abbott over problems with formula. "The FDA pretty much let industry -- Abbott -- define a 'lot' so as to minimize testing," he said in an interview. "The end result is that the micro-testing for pathogens was inadequate."

The FDA, armed with the new oversight authority, soon found problems in the Sturgis plant. While Abbott's internal policy was to test more product than required, it had not, the FDA report shows. The company discovered _Cronobacter_ in finished production batches that were ultimately destroyed in [2019] and the following year [2020], FDA records show. The Justice Department ultimately cited the contamination as justification to go to federal court this month to force reforms. A [September 2019] FDA inspection noted that Abbott had received a complaint from a nurse practitioner about 5 babies who had consumed Similac Sensitive formula and were projectile vomiting for reasons that were not clear. A baby with confirmed _Cronobacter_ was having seizures after consuming 3 types of Similac, the report said. The infant described above was one of the babies who fell ill that year after being fed Similac, though his illness was not reported to the authorities at the time.

The company had discovered _Cronobacter_ that year [2019] in its Similac Alimentum product for sensitive babies, records show, in the weeks before the infant fell ill drinking the same type of formula. The 2019 FDA inspection report showed that Abbott did not find a link between any of the _Cronobacter_ complaints and its Sturgis manufacturing plant.

It was an inspection last September [2021] that uncovered serious process problems that would set in motion the most recent product recall.

On [16 Sep 2021], the FDA called the Sturgis plant to sort out COVID-19 procedures before the inspection. This was the plant's first FDA visit since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic. On the same day, officials in Minnesota reported to the CDC that an infant had been hospitalized with a _Cronobacter_ infection after consuming formula from the Sturgis plant.

When FDA officials arrived in Sturgis, agency records show, they found water pooled on the floor in 3 areas, a situation that could create a growth environment for bacteria. The FDA also discovered that the plant had found _Cronobacter_ in a finished powdered formula lot in June 2020. But the agency's inspectors did not swab for the bacterium in or near production areas on this September [2021] visit, it confirmed. The FDA concluded in a report that Abbott had not maintained the building "in a clean and sanitary condition."

By October [2021], the CDC found _Cronobacter_ in the Minnesota infant's open formula can, according to the agency. Yet 5 months passed before the FDA took samples in the Sturgis plant that were compared with the bacteria from the formula, according to the CDC (during some of those months, the FDA again held back inspectors amid the Omicron surge.) They were not a genetic match. That could have meant that the formula was contaminated from something in the baby's home. Or it could have meant that formula in the Sturgis plant that might have been contaminated was not tested.

In January [2022], a health department in Texas examined the only other sample that emerged from the 4 infant illnesses that resulted in the Sturgis recall. That baby's formula had no bacteria and the baby's strain of the virus did not match the Minnesota baby's. Still, FDA inspectors who returned at the end of the month found more standing water. This time they swabbed around the production area and found _Cronobacter_, agency records show. They discovered that the company's own testing from [6 to 20 Feb 2022] found the bacterium 20 times in the plant, including in critical areas, according to the inspection report. By [17 Feb 2022], the company issued a major voluntary recall and halted production. The FDA is now seeking authority to require formula makers to do more testing and to ensure that details about the _Cronobacter_ they find are entered into a national database.

Determining exactly how much should be tested is a difficult equation that requires regulators to make decisions about what an acceptable amount of risk is and at what cost, said Barbara Kowalcyk, the director of the Center for Foodborne Illness Research and Prevention at Ohio State University. Meat and poultry are inspected far more regularly than infant formula, she said. "Do I think they need to re-look at the regulation? Absolutely."

When the mother of the infant discussed above saw the news about other babies who had become ill with _Cronobacter_ infections and the possible link to powdered formula, it reopened all her old anxiety. No one ever told her, she said, that powdered formula, unlike its liquid equivalent, could not be considered sterile. The CDC advises parents of newborns to use sterile liquid formula or to prepare powdered formula with very hot water, though no such explicit warning is required to be posted on formula labels.

[Since earlier postings, the CDC has reported that it does not believe that any _Salmonella_ bacteria were linked to this outbreak, just _Cronobacter_. The finding that the strains of _Cronobacter sakazakii_ found in the environment of the plant did not genetically match the clinical isolates (in other words, no "smoking gun") does not exonerate the product, however.

_Cronobacter sakazakii_ is a facultative anaerobic gram-negative bacillus that belongs to the Enterobacteriaceae family. The organism has been implicated in neonatal intensive care unit outbreaks of meningitis, septicemia, and necrotizing enterocolitis, particularly in preterm infants, although infections due to _C. sakazakii_ can occur in older infants, children, and adults. The association of neonatal infection due to _C. sakazakii_ with the use of powdered infant formula is not new. ProMED has previously reported on infections associated with powdered infant formula contaminated by _C. sakazakii_ (formerly called _Enterobacter sakazakii_) as seen in the "See Also" section below.

The organism has been associated with a number of different kinds of powdered formulas from many different countries, including the USA (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. _Enterobacter sakazakii_ infections associated with the use of powdered infant formula - Tennessee, 2001. MMWR. 2002; 51(14): 297-300). Genotyping has shown that patient and formula isolates shared the same typing pattern (Clark N C, Hill B C, O'Hara C M, et al. Epidemiologic typing of _Enterobacter sakazakii_ in 2 neonatal nosocomial outbreaks. Diagn Microbiol Infect Dis. 1990; 13(6): 467-72; doi: 10.1016/0732-8893(90)90078-a).

_Cronobacter_ are frequently isolated from the environment, plant material (wheat, rice, herbs, and spices) and various food products. Ingredients, such as starches from wheat and rice, can be a source of _Cronobacter_ that have been found to contaminate powdered infant formula. Because powdered infant formulas are not necessarily sterile and may contain pathogenic bacteria, recommendations have been made concerning the preparation and handling of these products (Agostoni C, Axelsson I, Goulet O, et al. Preparation and handling of powdered infant formula: a commentary by the ESPGHAN committee on nutrition. J Pediatr Gastroenterol Nutr. 2004; 39(4): 320-22; doi: 10.1097/00005176-200410000-00002).

A past American administration worked hard to deregulate many industries. Deregulation, besides certainly adding to the profits of the industries, will lead to more issues. - Mod.LL
