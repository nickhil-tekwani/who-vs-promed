Deputy Minister of Health Nguyen Thanh Long has voiced concern over the complicated development of hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD) in the coming days if preventive measures are not effectively adopted. To date [17 Oct 2018], all provinces and cities across the country have reported multiple cases of this infectious disease, Lao Dong newspaper reported.

The Ministry of Health asked local authorities to provide guidance, organize campaigns aimed at fighting the spread of the disease and encourage local residents to join efforts to manage the disease. Besides this, healthcare agencies must actively follow up on the disease's development and map out solutions to quickly detect and address infectious cases.

Data from the General Department of Preventive Medicine, under the ministry, show that the country reported 53 529 infected people as of September 2018, down 25.3% year-on-year. Of these cases, more than 25 800 were admitted to hospitals, down some 20% versus the year-ago period, and 6 people died of the disease in 5 provinces and cities in the south.

However, HCMC, Hanoi, Long An, Dong Nai, Binh Duong, Danang and Quang Ngai have seen a surging number of HFMD patients in recent weeks.

In HCMC, nearly 400 infected people were admitted to hospitals between 28 Sep and 4 Oct 2018, raising the total number of HFMD inpatients in the city to more than 4000 cases in the January to September [2018] period, according to the municipal Preventive Medicine Center.

Meanwhile, Pediatrics Hospital in Can Tho City has admitted nearly 500 infected children during the first 2 weeks of October [2018], doubling the figure of the year-ago period.

Notably, in the Central Highlands province of Gia Lai, the Kindergarten May 1, which is in Ia Yok Commune, Ia Grai District, had to shut down temporarily to prevent the disease from spreading after as many as 27 children were infected. According to the Ia Grai Health Division, the number of HFMD patients is rapidly increasing, amounting to 40 cases at the start of this month [October 2018], mainly found in the Ia Yok Commune.

Apart from that, Quang Ngai Obstetrics and Pediatrics Hospital in the central region is heavily overloaded because of HFMD. Statistics from the provincial Center for Disease Control revealed that more than 1300 infected cases have been recorded this year [2018], up 2-fold against last year's [2017] figure.

As the number of HFMD patients is escalating across the country, many hospitals are overloaded and working at full capacity to cope with the disease. The health ministry has called on the local people, especially mothers, to actively adopt preventive measures in their daily activities, such as washing their hands with soap, sterilizing home appliances regularly and paying attention to personal and public hygiene.

An increase in Coxsackie virus has been reported in Naugatuck [Connecticut] Public Schools. Naugatuck school nurses sent a letter to parents informing them of the virus, the text of which follows.

"There has been an increased occurrence of the Coxsackie virus, also known as hand-foot-mouth disease, in our student population.

"The Coxsackie virus is a viral illness that usually affects children younger than 5 [years]. However, some older children and even adults may get it. It typically starts with a fever, sore throat and a rash that may develop inside the mouth, on the hands, on the feet, and on the diaper area.

"It is spread through close personal contact, through the air (through coughing or sneezing), contact with feces, or through contact with contaminated objects. People are most contagious during the 1st week of the virus.

"If your child has any of these signs or symptoms, please keep them home from school. In order for a student to return to school, they must be fever free for 24 hours without the use of medication and have no open sores. If you are unsure as to whether your child should be in school, please contact their pediatrician or your school nurse.

"If your child was dismissed from school with an undiagnosed rash, a note from their medical provider must be submitted to the school nurse confirming the rash is non-contagious."

Taylor S, Khan M, Zaidi S, et al. Central serous retinopathy and hand-foot-mouth disease: coincidence or causation? International Medical Case Reports Journal 2018;11:277-282.

Abstract
--------
Introduction: The clinical and pathological correlation between hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD) and ocular complications has not yet been established. However, individual case reports indicate a trend that may be the emergence of a new burden of the previous self-limiting virus. This virus is particularly prevalent in childcare centers and poses an infectious disease risk for this workplace.

Objectives: The primary objective of this case report is to describe an unusual clinical record of a patient who developed central serous retinopathy while unwell with HFMD. Discussion of management strategies for this workplace, its staff, and visitors is also included.

Methods: This was an observational case report that was identified and reported retrospectively. For comparison, a search of the literature to identify similar ocular complications of HFMD was also undertaken. Results from this search, in addition to international data and prevention and management strategies, are also provided.

Results: A total of 13 individual case reports with ocular associations, including this clinical record, were identified in the literature worldwide. The median age was 33 years, and 3 patients (23%) were female. No treatment or management guidelines for ocular complications of HFMD have been identified.

Conclusion: Severe and potentially life-threatening complications of a seemingly harmless childhood illness are represented sporadically in the literature. The requirement for research and evaluation into this emerging occupational hazard area is necessary for improved prevention, management, and treatment strategies to be developed.

[Borrowed from Mod.LK: "Enteroviruses are the causative agents of hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD); included in the enteroviruses are polioviruses, coxsackieviruses, echoviruses, and enteroviruses. Enterovirus 71, a non-polio enterovirus, has been implicated in HFMD outbreaks in southeast Asia over the past several years. Complications associated with HFMD caused by the more pathogenic EV-71 strain include encephalitis, aseptic meningitis, acute flaccid paralysis, pulmonary edema or hemorrhage, and myocarditis. Most deaths from HFMD occur as a result of pulmonary edema or hemorrhage."

HFMD most often occurs in the spring and fall and is most frequently seen in young children, infants, and toddlers. It is characterized by fever and a blister-like rash affecting the palms of the hands and soles of the feet, along with blisters inside the mouth. (It is unrelated to foot and mouth disease, which affects livestock.)

There are no tests indicated in obvious cases of HFMD. The diagnosis is made based on the typical symptoms and signs found on examination. This is because the diagnostic laboratory tests that are available generally take 2 to 3 weeks to get results, and generally the symptoms of the illness will have resolved already by this time. - Mod.UBA
