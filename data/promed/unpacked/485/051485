[re: ProMED-mail Japanese encephalitis & other - India (15): (AS,WB) 20140801.2652476]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Assam and the northern part of West Bengal are contiguous and traditionally JE [Japanese encephalitis virus] enzootic areas. The 2014 southwest monsoon reached there in late June [2014] and since the end of June cases of JE have been reported in both states and also in the next-door state of Arunachal Pradesh (see archive no 20140727.2638359).

The term acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) is used in the context of JE epidemic to denote encephalitis cases that are not laboratory confirmed for one reason or another. Thus, in Assam and West Bengal, the cases of JE and AES should be added up to see the real magnitude of JE outbreak. I understand that West Nile virus is also present in that region and some AES may indeed be West Nile encephalitis.

In pre-monsoon period, particularly in May and June, outbreaks of Reye-like acute hypoglycemic encephalopathy occur in the northwestern region of Bihar state and that is also popularly but unfortunately called AES. Many doctors, the media, and the public consider these encephalopathy cases as encephalitis because of the term AES. This has been now clarified and in June 2014 children were treated by 10 per cent dextrose infusion and many lives were saved (under publication). This region is not JE enzootic, and here there is no reason to conflate acute hypoglycemic encephalopathy and JE or encephalitis of any other cause.

There is no specific line of command for outbreak management in these states. In the absence of Department of Public Health in the Ministries of Health either in the Federal and in state governments, outbreaks soon become an administrative and political problem. Without public health surveillance early signals of outbreaks are not picked up and no interception interventions are applied on time. JE vaccination is conducted here by the Expanded Program on Immunisation [EPI] but there is disconnect between EPI and outbreak management. In short we know what should be done to prevent and control outbreaks but the system is not geared to be able to apply that knowledge.

[ProMED-mail is grateful for Dr John's clarification of the use of the term AES in the reports that come to us for posting. We await with interest the publication of the Reye-like acute hypoglycemic encephalopathy report. That will help with interpretation of the Bihar state pre-monsoon reports of AES that appear in the popular press, which frequently cite statements of government officials about the occurrence of AES cases there. It would be of interest to know how many, if any, of the reported JE virus infection cases are in reality due to West Nile virus infections.
