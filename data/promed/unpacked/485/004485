Belizean health authorities have confirmed an outbreak of the deadly
DHF in western Belize. The outbreak was confirmed in the Cayo
district, which is 70 miles [113 km] from Belize City, on the western
border with Guatemala.

According to the Ministry of Health, 114 dengue cases have been
confirmed in Cayo between 4-14 July [2009], prompting the authorities
to issue an advisory to the general public. A statement from the
health ministry here says that the Central Medical Laboratory in
Belize City had confirmed 45 new cases of dengue and "a number of
specimens await confirmation." Of the 114 confirmed dengue cases, the
Ministry of Health says that 17 cases were clinically diagnosed as
DHF, the majority of which came from the Cayo District.

Deputy director of health services Marjorie Parks says that dengue
fever is endemic to Belize and as such "it is expected that there
will be sudden occurrences on an annual basis." Parks says that since
the outbreak is in the western part of the country, in close
proximity to the border with Guatemala, "a slight increase in the
number of cases is expected because the neighboring town of Melchor
de Mencos, Guatemala is considered a hotspot for the disease."

Parks says that the Ministry of Health has already begun an awareness
campaign on proper health practices to avoid the fever by destroying
breeding grounds for the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito, which is the
vector responsible for the spread of dengue fever [virus].

As a result of the outbreak, Belizean health officials have stepped
up efforts to contain the spread of the disease, and measures include
an increase in ultra-low volume (ULV) spray cycles especially in the
Cayo District. The Ministry of Health has also embarked on a public
education campaign to inform the general public on ways to prevent
the transmission of dengue [virus] and vector control personnel from
the Ministry of Health are now going house to house in the affected
area to conduct premise inspections, identification of breeding
sites, and the elimination of larvae.

[The 23 Jul 2009 edition of the San Pedro Sun
(<http://www.sanpedrosun.net/09-282.html>) indicated that there have
been 184 dengue cases nationally in Belize. The Cayo district is a
major ecotourism destination in Belize, and may be adversely affected
by this dengue outbreak. One hopes that the prompt efforts to control
the dengue virus vector are successful and prevent harm to the
important tourist industry there. Belize has experienced dengue
outbreaks in the recent past.

[2] Chile (Easter Island)
Date: Fri 24 Jul 2009
From: Julio Garcia Moreno <jgarcia@ispch.cl>


Dengue virus type 4 (DEN-4) has been detected for the 1st time on
Easter Island, Chile.

Dengue is a disease, which was present in the country [Chile] back in
1889 in Iquique in the northern area of the country. The [dengue
virus vector _Aedes aegypti_] was eradicated from the national
territory in 1961, and certified by PAHO [Pan American Health
Organization], with only sporadic [dengue] cases in travelers from
endemic areas.

In 2000, the presence of the mosquito _Aedes aegypti_ was confirmed
on Easter Island, which was termed "nao nao" by the inhabitants. This
place is one of the principal islands of the country [Chile], and is
located in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, some 3800 km (2361 mi)
from the coast of Chile. Administratively, it is in Region V of
Valparaiso, and has an area of 163.2 sq km (63 sq mi) and a
population estimated at 3820 inhabitants, concentrated mainly in the
capital Hanga Roa. It is a frequent tourist destination because of
its natural beauty and its ancestral culture of the Rapa Nui ethnic
group, and famous for the presence of the giant head statues. The
climate is rainy tropics, with little [seasonal] change during the
year. The main occupations of the islanders are fishing and tourism.

In 2002 there was a [dengue] outbreak on the island, which affected
636 people, of which 132 were confirmed serologically by IgM
antibodies and some with positive virus isolation; the remainder were
diagnosed [as dengue infections] from their epidemiological
connections. This outbreak affected 17 percent of the population.

Environmental studies demonstrated the presence of the [vector]
mosquito in 70 percent of the houses studied; through environmental
measures it was reduced to 5 percent. The clinical presentations were
of classical dengue fever, without deaths. The reference laboratory
of the Public Health Institute of Chile (ISP) provided confirmation
of the cases and sequenced the complete genome of dengue [virus]
serotype 1 isolated during this outbreak, genetically related to
[subtype] IV of DEN-1 [virus] of the Pacific.

Because of the epidemiological context and the island's climate,
which is favorable for persistence of the vector, the ISP carried out
constant laboratory surveillance of suspected dengue cases given the
possibility of the introduction of new [dengue virus] serotypes into
the island. After the [2002] outbreak, there were no new cases until
2006, when there were 3. In 2007, there was a new outbreak of [dengue
virus] serotype 1 but of lower magnitude than in 2002, affecting 27
people. In 2008, 25 cases were reported.

Beginning in June 2009, as part of the routine laboratory
surveillance activities, samples from 2 islanders with classical
dengue clinical signs were studied. These samples underwent
amplification of several envelope genetic regions of the virus, which
were sequenced. The analysis of these sequences demonstrated for the
1st time that the dengue 4 virus serotype was present on the island.

These important findings have been possible due to constant
laboratory monitoring, which includes genetic recognition of the
dengue viruses circulating on Easter Island and the cases imported
into the Chilean mainland.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Garcia for this interesting history of dengue
outbreaks and cases on Easter Island and the recent appearance of
dengue virus type 4. This report is a good illustration of the value
of prospective field surveillance supported by a laboratory using
contemporary virological diagnostic techniques. It would be of
interest to know if an aggressive vector control program has been
reinitiated on the island.
