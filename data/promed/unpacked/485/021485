Abstract
--------
_Leishmania (Leishmania) infantum_ is the zoonotic agent of visceral leishmaniasis (VL), a disease with a global distribution. The transmission scenario of VL has been undergoing changes worldwide, with the biologic cycle invading urbanized areas and dispersing the parasites into other previously free areas.

The epidemiological cycle in Brazil has dispersed from the Northeast to other regions of the country. In this study, an integrative approach, including genotyping Brazilian strains of _L. (L.) infantum_ for 14 microsatellite markers and reviewing historical records of the disease, was used to assess dispersion routes throughout central-southern Brazil. Our results support 3 _L. (L.) infantum_ dispersion routes: A) dispersion from Bolivia to the states of Mato Grosso, Mato Grosso do Sul, and Sao Paulo via the Bolivia-Brazil gas pipeline from 1998 to 2005; B) VL dispersion from Paraguay to the Brazilian side of the triple border (Foz do Iguacu and Santa Terezinha de Itaipu) during after 2012; and C) emergence of a new _L. (L.) infantum_ cluster in western Santa Catarina State and its dispersion to southern Parana State (municipality of Pato Branco), after 2013. Hypotheses regarding possible entries of _L. (L.) infantum_ into the area of the triple border are presented and discussed. Understanding how VL has dispersed is vital to the development of control measures for this disease and to avoid future dispersion events.

[Selected excerpts from the discussion]
A) Dispersion from west to east along the Bolivia-Brazil gas pipeline between 1998 and 2005 (A in Fig 4 -- available at the source URL above)
The construction of the Bolivia-Brazil gas pipeline started in 1998 in Bolivia and expanded into Mato Grosso do Sul (from Corumba to Tres Lagoas), Sao Paulo (from northwest, close to Andradina, to the southeast), Rio de Janeiro, and Minas Gerais. During this construction, the displacement of employees and their pets from Corumba (an endemic area) to other cities of Mato Grosso do Sul and neighboring states along the course of gas pipeline may have dispersed the parasite into the Southeast Region. Moreover, the deforestation and ecological imbalance resulting from the construction itself may have favored the dispersion of the vector _Lutzomyia longipalpis_ into urban areas.

B) Dispersion from Paraguay to Brazilian cities at the triple border after 2012 (that is, Foz do Iguacu and Santa Terezinha de Itaipu) (B in Fig 4 -- available at the source URL above);
The 2nd dispersion hypothesis represents the dispersion of _L. (L.) infantum_ from Paraguay to Brazilian cities close to the triple border between Argentina-Brazil-Paraguay. VL was first described in Asuncion, Paraguay, in 1998, and then was found to have dispersed to other cities in the country between 2006 and 2010, likely reaching the triple border around 2012. Supporting this, the Cluster 2.2 [Fig. 4 -- blue] is the most prevalent cluster in Paraguay, Foz do Iguacu, and Santa Terezinha de Itaipu. On the Brazilian side of the triple border, Foz do Iguacu borders Argentina and Paraguay and it is considered a potential place for VL dispersion due the intense flow of people and environmental conditions suitable for the emergence of _Lu. longipalpis_ and VL.

C) The emergence of a new cluster in western Santa Catarina State (that ism, the cities of Sao Miguel do Oeste and Descanso) in 2013, and its dispersion to southern Parana State (Pato Branco) (C in Fig 4 -- available at the source URL above). The evidence supporting each reconstructed route is provided below.
The 3rd dispersion of _L. (L.) infantum_ in the South Region of Brazil is represented by a new cluster in western Santa Catarina State. The 1st autochthonous cases of cVL in this state were in Florianopolis in 2010 and in the western region in 2013 (Sao Miguel do Oeste and Descanso). The allochthonous cVL case described for Curitiba in 2004 (a dog captured off the street), was also assigned in this cluster. The origin of this cluster is still unclear, but it is genetically similar to MON-24 from Algeria, MON-108 from France, and MON-198 from Spain. Therefore, this cluster may represent a new contemporary introduction of _L. (L.) infantum_ from the Old World.

The study is an excellent example of how molecular analysis helps to dissect the epidemiology of an infectious disease.

The epidemiology of _Leishmania_ is complicated, with different strains, reservoirs, and sandfly species. For L. infantum in particular, domestic and wild canids are the natural reservoir, and the authors point out that L. infantum (also often called L. chagasi in Latin America) was introduced to Brazil by dogs brought by colonizers from Portugal and Spain.

The 1st 2 examples A and B above point to increasing human activity, and especially for A, clearing forest for a construction project. Example C is more intriguing, but the clustering with isolates from Europe and Tunisia or Algeria is difficult to explain except by a new and more recent introduction from the Old World. This could be an infected human travelling or an infected pet dog, and it illustrates that diseases travel with their hosts and may establish in new areas if the right climate, vector, and reservoir conditions exist. - Mod.EP
