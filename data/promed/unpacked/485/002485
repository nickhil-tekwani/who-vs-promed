1st case of bird flu hits Philippines
----------------------------------------
The Philippines has suffered its 1st case of bird flu after ducks were
found to be infected in a town north of Manila, prompting the country to
immediately halt poultry exports to Japan, officials said Friday [8 Jul 2005].
Health Secretary Francisco Duque said samples have been sent to Australia
to determine whether the strain of avian influenza was the same as the one
that has killed dozens of people elsewhere in Asia, according to Reuters.
"There's no cause for alarm," Duque said in a television interview. "We're
still investigating the case."
The government expects to receive results of the tests on the infected
strain in a week.
A quarantine zone has been set up around the town of Calumpit in Bulacan
province to halt the trading and sale of poultry for a week, in addition to
the immediate slaughter of the affected flocks, government officials said.
The H5N1 strain of the avian influenza virus has killed 54 people of the
154 infected in Asia so far. More than 140 million chickens have been
killed in the region to halt bird flu, causing millions of dollars in losses.
Agriculture Secretary Arthur Yap said halting exports to Japan was a
"voluntary" decision by the private sector.
The Philippines is not a big poultry exporter but it has been shipping
cargoes to Japan, which banned supplies from Thailand where earlier bird
flu outbreaks devastated the poultry industry.
The Department of Agriculture and the Department of Health jointly assured
the people that it was safe to eat chicken and properly cooked duck meat.
"What we are carefully guarding against is the H5N1 strain, which is highly
pathogenic and can be transmitted to other farm animals and even people,"
Yap said.
"We can't see the symptoms of H5N1. The ducks are roaming around and are
very healthy, and there are no signs of flu."
United Nations officials told a conference in Kuala Lumpur last week that
bird flu was entrenched in Asia and it would take up to a decade to rid the
region of the virus and declare humans, animals and meat safe from infection.

[The news item lacks important data, such as the method by which the
"outbreak" or "infections" have been detected, and which samples have been
sent to Australia (isolated virus? sera? other tissues?). If indeed no
clinical signs have been observed in the ducks under suspicion as stated,
while chickens are not mentioned at all, the suspicion might be based upon
serological evidence. The authorities are expected to notify OIE on results
of all clinical and laboratory-based data obtained as soon as possible,
while waiting for additional information from the reference laboratory in
Australia, especially the accurate definition of the virus strain and its
pathogenicity for chickens. The currently available data are not sufficient
to enable a reliable determination of the public-health aspects of the
involved disease agent at present.
The newswire is illustrated with a picture of Philippine's Health secretary
Francisco Duque, outgoing Agriculture Secretary Arturo Yap, and incoming
Agriculture Secretary Domingo Panganiban eat fried chicken after announcing
the Philippines first case of bird flu. Their demonstration of trust in the
wholesomeness, quality and -- foremost -- safety of the local poultry
produce is meant to prevent customers' reactions and damage to the local
poultry industry. - Mod. AS]
