India: outbreak of jaundice in Maharashtra
-----------------------------------------------
A jaundice outbreak in Baramati has spread to Pune, with 61 people from
Alandi infected by drinking contaminated water. Deputy Director of Health
Services (Pune region) Y H Doiphode told Newsline on Sun 27 Mar 2005 that
the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has been alerted. "The situation is
the same as in Baramati," he said. While 6 people have been hospitalized,
Doiphode said 16 beds have been arranged at the Primary Health Centre at
Alandi as an additional measure. "A doctor has also been posted at the PHC
who will monitor the patients, 24 hours," he said. The outbreak is due to
leakage in drainage lines contaminating the drinking water supply that runs
parallel to the drainage pipelines.

Meanwhile, on day 5, jaundice cases in Baramati have gone up to 222. "It
will take at least 8 more days for the epidemic to settle down," Doiphode
said. He said surveys had been initiated in both Pune and Baramati. In
Baramati, precautionary measures, like boiling water and adding medichlor
drops, have also been taken. One case, a pregnant woman in critical
condition, has been admitted to KEM Hospital in Pune for further treatment.

Doiphode, who had stayed at Baramati since the 1st report of 19 cases was
submitted on 22 Mar 2005, said a thorough door-to-door survey has been
undertaken, in which nurses and other volunteers will enquire about the
health status of family members. A team of 25 people are involved in the
survey in Baramati city, which has a population of 50 000. The affected
areas are Sathenagar, Amrayee, Siddharth Nagar, Bhimnagar and Panchsheel
Nagar. While the local municipal council officials had stopped the water
supply to these areas and provided water via tankers, they have now
repaired the faulty lines and have started releasing water on a trial basis.

Health workers have been given the OT (Ortho Tolydene) test kit to detect
the content of chlorine in the water. Hoteliers have also been issued
strict instructions not to sell stale food and to provide clean water. The
officials have also taken a strict view of eateries at roadside, Doiphode
added. While samples were being sent to the public health laboratory in
Pune, Doiphode said arrangements had been made to check the samples in
hospitals at Baramati. Private practitioners have also been urged to
cooperate with the government officials and report the number of jaundice
patients being treated. 232 immunoglobulin injections have been sent from
KEM Hospital, Mumbai, for the immunization of pregnant women against
jaundice. "This has been done on a priority basis, as there are already 35
cases of pregnant women falling sick, and it may be higher," Doiphode said.

On Sun 27 Mar 2005, handbills and pamphlets were distributed in Baramati.
Apart from advising the residents to boil water and add medichlor drops,
information on symptoms and treatment of jaundice is also being provided
via cable television. Doiphode said there was panic among the residents,
but health officials and local municipal authorities had immediately taken
stock of the situation.

[An outbreak of jaundice associated with contaminated drinking water
supplies is likely to be caused by either or both of the enteric viruses,
hepatitis A virus and hepatitis E virus. Until the identity of the
etiologic agent is determined, it is clear that the local health
authorities are erring on the side of caution and providing immunoglobulin
treatment for pregnant women, who are the group at greatest risk from
hepatitis E virus infection. Further information would be appreciated. -
