According to the Administration of Rospotrebnadzor, in the Republic of
Udmurtia there were 142 visits to healthcare facilities as a
consequence of tick bites during last week (Fri 14 Aug - Thu 20 Aug
2009). This number is 1.4 times lower if compared with the same
indicator for the previous year [2008].

In total, 19 878 people, including 3520 children (18 percent),
reported tick bites since the beginning of the tick season in 2009,
which is 7 percent more than in 2008. Historically, the highest number
of tick bites (7871) were recorded in the capital of Udmurtia [Izhevsk].

17 520 ticks have been tested in the virology laboratory of Udmurtia.
12.8 percent of samples tested positive for tick-borne encephalitis
[virus infection], and 39.5 percent tested positive for tick-borne
borelliosis [Lyme disease, the other major tick transmitted disease in
the Republic]. Currently, there are 46 confirmed cases of tick-borne
encephalitis (a 4 percent increase from the previous year [2008]).

Tick activity is at its highest during the warm months to the first
frosts, and precautions must be taken to avoid tick bites throughout
this period, especially during recreation and work in forested areas.
The most effective protection is through immunisation against
tick-borne encephalitis virus infection. Russian and imported vaccines
confer similar levels of protection, and the producers guarantee
adequate antibody responses in not less that 90 percent of cases. The
vaccination schedule consists of 3 shots, the 1st is recommended in
October or November, the 2nd in March or April of the following year,
not less than 2 weeks before tick activity resumes, and the 3rd shot
is administered after one year. Subsequently, immune status is
maintained by single shots every 3 years. Emergency immunization
allows administration of 2 shots 2 weeks apart, and the remaining
doses are administered according to the normal schedule.
