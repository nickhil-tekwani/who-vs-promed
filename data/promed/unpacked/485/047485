RABIES VACCINE STORAGE: REQUEST FOR INFORMATION

From: Richard Hodes, MD <ajdc@telecom.net.et>

This week I had a 12 year old Ethiopian girl who presented 3 days after an
unprovoked dog bite from a dog which bit her and then disappeared. The
bite broke the skin of her leg in several places. In my mind, she would
clearly benefit from post-exposure prophylaxis. She has no previous
immunization against rabies.
I have some not-quite expired duck embryo vaccine produced by the Swiss
Serum Institute in Bern. However, it was stored in the freezer (normal home
freezer) rather than the refrigerator, as recommended by the manufacturer.
A) Does anyone know how this would affect vaccine potency?
B) Can someone suggest the proper diluent for this vaccine, since some of
the diluents have exploded from being frozen.
Rabies immune globulin is unavailable here, and the only rabies vaccine is
of equine origin, made locally.
Inquiries to the manufacturer have not been answered.
