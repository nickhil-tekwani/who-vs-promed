The purging of the affected cattle ranch in Sinaloa has reached 80 percent.
It is receiving official support and there is no risk for humans
--------------------------------------------------
Approximately 2500 head of cattle have been culled during the past 2 months
because of high levels of tuberculosis and brucellosis. The cattle have
been replaced through federal support.
Since the purging of the contaminated ranch -- more than 3000 head of
cattle, close to 80 percent -- it is expected that the southern part of the
state will be free of both diseases by September 2003.
Jesus Osuna Carrasco, president of the Mazatlan Breeders' Association, was
informed that the owner has received a federal subsidy for each animal
sacrificed, so that he may keep the ranch and the breeders may continue
working.
The most affected communities in Mazatlan are El Quelite, El Habla, and
Escamillas, where the main dairy and beef farms are located. Breeders in
this area have expressed their concern because the daily requirement for
supplying the local markets is at least 100 000 liters of milk.
Osuna stated that several months ago it was made public that approximately
1000 head of cattle were contaminated, but that due to the lack of
resources and support, little had been done to combat the problem,
resulting in the propagation of the disease and the increasing desperation
of the breeders.
Osuna added that because of the region's humid climate, it is common for
bovine tuberculosis to increase during the rainy season. He further
explained that tuberculosis is a fatal disease for cattle and that the
affected animals must be sacrificed in order to avoid contagion. Signs in
the animals include cough and high fever.
The contaminated meat is apt for human consumption, since cooking it at
high temperatures destroys the bacteria. Nonetheless, veterinarians at the
municipal slaughterhouse are ensuring that no contaminated animals are
slaughtered and their meat and byproducts sold.
90 head of cattle are sacrificed daily at the municipal slaughterhouse, and
their products are inspected to ensure that they are fit for human
consumption. Osuna stated that the 2500 head of infected cattle were culled
at the municipal slaughterhouse.
Jorge Guillermo Felix, president of the Sinaloa Breeders' Union, stated
that the state and federal governments have created a fund to control the
problem and to provide support to the breeders from now until the end of 2003.
Felix announced that, for the time being, there are no quarantined ranches
in the region, but that the possibility of imposing quarantine measures at
any moment has not been discarded. He called on society and the owners of
cattle ranches not to be alarmed, since there are medical personnel at the
slaughterhouses examining every animal and ensuring that there is no risk
for humans.
Felix assured the breeders that support would be provided, but that it is
important that they collaborate in the effort to produce healthy cattle,
which will open the doors to exports of feeder cattle to the United States.
He further stated that there is also no risk regarding the consumption of
milk, because most of it is sold to pasteurizing plants where the absence
of contamination is ensured. [Brucellosis can be passed through
unpasteurized milk. The statement says that most of it is sold to
pasteurizing plants. "Most" is not "all." ­ Mod.TG]
Finally, Felix explained that the cattle have a metallic ring used for
control and for identification, so that if an animal becomes ill, it is
possible to determine its provenance immediately.

[Bovine tuberculosis is a chronic bacterial disease caused by the
acid-fast, slow-growing rod-shaped _Mycobacterium bovis_; transmission to
humans constitutes a public health problem.
[Bovine] tuberculosis (TB) can produce internal lesions in animals.
[Bovine] TB can be spread within a herd when an infected animal coughs,
releasing bacteria-laden mucus onto feed that is consumed, or into the air
that is inhaled by nearby cows.
Aerosol exposure to _M. bovis_ is considered to be the most frequent route
of infection of cattle, but infection by ingestion of contaminated material
also occurs. Characteristic tuberculous lesions occur most frequently in
the lungs and the retropharyngeal, bronchial, and mediastinal lymph nodes.
Lesions can also be found in the mesenteric lymph nodes, liver, spleen, on
serous membranes, and in other organs. - Mod.TG]
