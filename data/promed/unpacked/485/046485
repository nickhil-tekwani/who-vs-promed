After 2 years with no obligation to vaccinate against bluetongue in the province, despite being declared a restricted area, catarrhal fever or bluetongue reappears in Malaga [Andalusia]. The Veterinary Alert Network of the Ministry of Agriculture, Food, and the Environment has confirmed several outbreaks of bluetongue in Malaga and in the provinces of Huelva and Cadiz. According to test results, the circulation of BT serotype 4 has been confirmed. Subsequently, a total of 200 000 animals -- sheep and cattle -- in the province will have to be vaccinated against this serotype. Both organizations insisted yesterday [27 Nov 2013] that BT has no effect on humans, so that the meat can be consumed with confidence.

According to the regional secretary of the livestock sectors of COAG [Coordinator of Growers and Livestock Farmers Organisations], Antonio Rodriguez, the presence of the outbreak does not affect the mobility of the animals for the time being, except for holdings where outbreaks have been detected.

The Official State Bulletin (BOE) published on Wednesday [27 Nov 2013] order No AAA/2201/2013, dated 25 Nov 2013, modifying the "restricted" areas were vaccination of sheep and cattle against bluetongue is compulsory. The change comes after the reference laboratory confirmed in October 2013 the circulation of BTV-4 in Cadiz and Huelva, as well as of serotype 1 in the province of Toledo [Castile-La Mancha]. According to the Ministry of Agriculture, Food, and the Environment, the circulation of serotypes 1 [in Toledo] and 4 [in Andalusia] makes vaccination necessary in the restricted areas, which [in Andalusia include Malaga, Cadiz, and Huelva].

According to Rodriguez, although the circulation of the virus is expected to stop during the cold season, the animals should be vaccinated before the start of next year's [2014] hot season.

The proximity of the province to Morocco is blamed for the exposure of sheep and cattle in Malaga to the virus and farmers are requesting government subsidies for vaccination. Each dose of the vaccine costs about 3 Euro [USD 4] for sheep, and 4.5 Euro [USD 6] for cattle.

[Spain's 2013 BT situation, including maps with outbreaks' locations indicated as of 5 Nov 2013 and vaccination zones according to serotypes (1 and 4), has been recently described in the official Spanish presentation delivered during the SCoFCAH (Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health) meeting of 7 Nov 2013 in Brussels (see http://ec.europa.eu/food/committees/regulatory/scfcah/animal_health/presentations/20131107-8_bt_spain_en.pdf).
The provinces of Huelva, Cadiz, and Malaga were included within the serotype 4 vaccination zone.

Traditionally, bluetongue is a serious clinical disease in sheep, particularly European breeds. The phenomenon of clinical disease in cattle observed during recent years in Europe had been regarded as unusual until recently. Cattle (and goats) have been known to be subclinical sentinels for the virus. One of the most susceptible breeds known, with high mortality rates, is the Sardinian dairy sheep.

Outbreaks due to infection of sheep with BT serotype 4 have also been observed recently in southern Portugal. According to Portugal's presentation during the SCoFCAH meeting of 7 Nov 2013 in Brussels, 2 outbreaks of BTV-4 in sheep were confirmed on 1 Nov 2013 by RT-PCR at the Algarve region, municipality of Faro, following the investigation of clinical suspicions. An additional 3 clinical suspicions in the municipalities of Faro (1) and Silves (2) were confirmed on 6 Nov 2013.
