In reply to you request I inform you that among zoonotic virus infections
and all other natural focus diseases for humans, the morbidity rate of
hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) leads in Russia. The disease
has been recognized in Russia since 1930 and since 1978 HFRS has been
included in the official reporting system. A total of 91,603 cases were
registered from 1978 to 1996 from 61 of 89 administrative regions involving
88,322 cases from European part (from 46 of 60 administrative regions), and
3,281 cases from Asian part of Russia (from 15 of 29 administrative
regions). Thus, 96.4% of total number of HFRS cases were registered in
European, and only 3.6% in Asian Russia, with annual average morbidity
rates of 4.0 and 0.6 per 100,000 population, respectively. There is the
tendency toward increasing morbidity due to HFRS in Russia, especially this
year. For [the first nine months of 1997, morbidity rates increased three
times in the country as a whole, and more than five times in certain
administrative regions of European Russia, as compared to the same period
of 1996.
The distribution of HFRS in Russia was found to be scattered throughout the
country. However, different geographical regions are distinguished by
[considerably different morbidity rates. Most high rates of annual HFRS
incidence occur in the Ural, Volga and Viatka territories. In this area
there are nine administrative regions with high HFRS morbidity, including
Bashkiria region with the highest morbidity in Europe (43.2 per 100,000
population). In Bashkiria there is [the Blagoveschensk district with an
annual average morbidity rate of 320 per 100,000 population.
Present situation with HFRS in Bashkiria: For the 9-month period of 1997
there are 4377 HFRS cases registered (Jan-176, Feb-25, Mar-2, Apr-7,
May-74, Jun-350, Jul-623, Aug-1360, Sep-1760); morbidity rate - 107. 4 per
100,000 population; fatality rate - 0.6%. For the same period of 1996
there were 662 HFRS cases registered in Bashkiria (morbidity rate - 16. 2).
Most HFRS patients are in the 20-45 year age group; children under the age
of 14 years represented approximately 5% of the cases. Males outnumber
females by a ratio of 5:1.
Analysis of results of examination of small mammals showed that practically
each landscape zone has natural foci with different degrees of hantavirus
activity. More or less polyhostality of hantaviruses was observed in all
the vegetative zones. Hantavirus antigen was found in rodents of 18
species. Among all animals found to be hantavirus antigen-positive there
is a 4-fold predominance of bank voles (_Clethrionomys glareolus_) as
compared to all other species. Serological and genetic typing of
hantavirus strains as well as wild rodents lung tissue indicates the
circulation of Puumala virus in Bashkiria. HFRS cases in Bashkiria are
[caused by Puumala virus. The principal source of this type is the bank
vole, _Clethrionomys glareolus_.

[We are very grateful to Evgeniy for providing this informative and
interesting summary of a great deal of work and for sharing this
information with the readers of ProMED-mail. Clearly, HFRS is a serious
problem in Russia and, for those who think this an exotic disease, a
reminder that what may be exotic in one place is not exotic in another.
When the morbidity rate of a disease increases 7-fold in one year, factors
other than chance must be considered. - Mod.CHC
