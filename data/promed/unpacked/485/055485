Mystery disease kills thousands of Afghan animals
-----------------------------------------------
A mystery disease has killed more than 6000 animals in Afghanistan's
northeastern province of Badakhshan in the past 2 weeks, an official said
on Sunday [17 Apr 2005].
Authorities are waiting for test results, carried out by foreign aid
workers, to find the cause of the epidemic, said Engineer Mohammad Hassan,
chief of the agriculture and husbandry department of Badakhshan.
"It is a very strange type of disease, which locals call animal plague,"
Hassan told Reuters in Faizabad, the provincial capital of Badakhshan.
"So far, more than 6000 animals, largely goats, sheep and cows, have
perished as a result of the outbreak," he said.
Rugged Badakhshan lies near the border with China and Tajikistan, and a
majority of its residents rely on agriculture.

[Reports on undiagnosed mass mortality of livestock in Badakhshan were
initially posted by ProMED-mail 4 weeks ago. The current newswire indicates
that the situation seems to have deteriorated and allegedly involves small
and large ruminants, while diagnosis is still pending.
A response, obtained from FAO on 22 Mar 2005, included the following
observations: "Investigations are continuing, but we have been informed
that there is no indication that rinderpest is involved. It appears that
the disease events concern primarily small ruminants, and there are reports
of outbreaks of FMD in cattle, sheep and goats and PPR [peste des petits
ruminants] in sheep and goats, both diseases being a perennial problem in
Afghanistan."
It would be reassuring if concrete diagnostic data are obtained, probably
confirming PPR while, hopefully, excluding rinderpest. In case FMD is
involved as well, typing and subtyping are of importance. - Mod.AS]
