A 17-year-old boy from Chile's Region VIII [Bio-Bio] has died from a
hantavirus infection, the National Health Institute confirmed this
week. The boy passed away on 5 Mar 2009 in a hospital in Concepcion,
Chile's 2nd largest city after Santiago. He first began experiencing
symptoms of the virus [infection] on 28 Feb 2009, following a camping
trip near Region VIII's Santa Juana, the daily El Mercurio reported.

Southern Chile and Argentina are recognized hotspots for the deadly
virus, which was first discovered in the early 1950s during the
Korean War. The illness in fact takes its name from South Korea's
Hantaan River. Hantaviruses are also present in the United States,
Europe, China, Russia, Brazil, and Panama.

Humans can contract the virus through contact with rodents and their
urine or feces. Dried rodent droppings, which can turn to powder and
thus be inhaled by people, are particularly dangerous. The illness
usually takes 2 to 4 weeks to incubate and can begin with severe
flu-like symptoms. It can eventually cause internal hemorrhaging and
major organ failure.

So far there this year [2009] there have been 8 confirmed cases of
hantavirus infection [in Chile?]. One of the victims is currently in
hospital in Los Angeles, also in Region VIII. Last December [2008] an
English tourist died in Chile after contracting a hantavirus
infection in neighboring Argentina (previously reported in the
Patagonia Times on 4 Dec 2008, see
<http://www.patagoniatimes.cl/index.php/20081204703/News/Health-Sience/CHILE-ENGLISH-TOURIST-DIES-OF-LIKELY-HANTA-INFECTION.html>).

[Hantaviruses comprise one of 5 genera within the family
_Bunyaviridae_. Phylogenetic analysis of Old World and New World
hantaviruses indicates that the relationship among hantaviruses
corresponds with the phylogeny of their rodent hosts. New World
hantaviruses are carried by sigmodontine rodents. Although this
article does not specify which hantavirus is involved in this case,
the long-tail rice rat (_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_) is likely to be
the main hantavirus vector in central and southern Chile, and _Andes
virus_ is likely to be the species of hantavirus responsible. This is
the 2nd case this year (2009) in Chile of a teenager contracting
hantavirus infection during a camping trip, although not in the same locality.
