[1] USA: Pfizer Paxlovid distribution
Date: Sat 5 Feb 2022 2:08 PM CET

Paxlovid (nirmatrelvir and ritonavir), a 5-day oral COVID treatment that can significantly reduce the risk of hospitalization and death, has remained in critically short supply since its 22 Dec 2022 emergency authorization.

This has hamstrung healthcare providers as the winter surge caused by the omicron variant has driven a desperate need for treatments to keep people with COVID out of hospital. The situation has been worsened by states not prioritizing people at the highest risk of severe illness or death -- people who are immunocompromised and unvaccinated people with underlying health conditions.

[Shortages have also affected] GlaxoSmithKline and Vir Biotechnology's monoclonal antibody treatment authorized by the Food and Drug Administration to treat omicron, sotrovimab.

Timing is critical once someone at high risk of severe COVID is diagnosed. The pills must be started within 5 days of symptom onset, adding to the anxiety of filling a prescription.

Restricting antiviral prescriptions
-----------------------------------
The Biden administration has purchased 20 million Paxlovid courses, half of which Pfizer said it expects to deliver by the end of June [2022] and the remainder by 30 Sep 2022. A robust supply of the treatment is not expected until April.

Thus far, the federal government has been able to release just 265 000 Paxlovid courses to state health departments, even as the US documented some 20 million COVID cases and 55 000 related deaths in January [2022] alone. While cases of omicron are declining nationwide, there are still more than 140 000 hospitalizations, and thousands of people are dying from COVID daily.

Currently, the federal government apportions the Paxlovid supply to state health departments, which then distribute their share to local pharmacies, health systems, and long-term care facilities as they see fit.

"Not unlike the entire COVID response, the federal government has not wanted to put out anything other than guidance," Richard Freeman, regional chief clinical officer at Loyola Medicine in Chicago, said. "Then it's up to the states, so you have 50 different versions. I don't think that's helpful."

According to an NBC News survey of state health departments, only a few -- including those in Michigan, Minnesota, and New Mexico -- have established systems that limit access. Those states direct clinicians to only prescribe Paxlovid to the highest-risk patients. Or the health departments collaborate with pharmacies or health systems to which the state sends Paxlovid to help ensure they adhere to such restrictions.

"Our primary goal, with an eye on equity, is to protect the most vulnerable among us and to prevent the greatest number of severe outcomes," Dr Natasha Bagdasarian, chief medical executive of the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, said. In Michigan, the state health department issues and regularly updates a guidance document directing physicians to establish that a Paxlovid candidate is in the upper tiers of COVID risk. And then pharmacists at the Meijer retail chain, which is the state's primary Paxlovid purveyor, confirm the eligibility documentation before filling the prescription.

Other states -- such as Indiana, Maryland, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Wisconsin -- take a more relaxed approach, issuing communiqués to healthcare providers that only advise, but do not require, that they prescribe the therapy to people who most stand to benefit from it. Providers are typically urged to follow the National Institutes of Health COVID-19 treatment prioritization guidelines.

Some states, including Tennessee, have not sent clinicians any guidance on prioritizing access to the antivirals.

Medical ethicist Dr William Parker argued that the available COVID treatment supply should be more strictly dispensed based on narrow criteria. "We are justified in restricting access to just the highest-risk patients in order to reduce strain on the healthcare system and maximize lives saved," Parker, a health services researcher at the University of Chicago, said.

A better distribution system?
-----------------------------
As it is, states typically spread Paxlovid through chain pharmacies, leaving frantic residents to race, sometimes across considerable distances, to fill a prescription.

Some health systems have already used a lottery method for dispensing other COVID therapies when supplies were tight. In 2020, the 40-hospital University of Pittsburgh Medical Center system launched a lottery, one weighted to slightly favor front-line workers and people from disadvantaged communities, to allocate Gilead Sciences' remdesivir to eligible hospitalized patients.

Who should get the antivirals first?
------------------------------------
According to the National Institutes of Health, people at the greatest risk of severe COVID -- those in the top prioritization tier -- include:
- People who are immunocompromised.
- Unvaccinated people who are 75 and older.
- Unvaccinated people who are 65 and up and have additional risk factors, such as diabetes, cancer, obesity, or diseases of the heart, kidneys, liver, or lungs.

The next tier of risk includes all unvaccinated people ages 65 and older, as well as all unvaccinated people with risk factors.

It's not clear whether Paxlovid benefits people who are vaccinated. The study submitted to the FDA only included high-risk unvaccinated individuals, although the agency's authorization applies to people at "high risk for progression to severe COVID-19" regardless of vaccination status.

"If you just take the FDA at face value, you're giving Paxlovid to an awful lot of people who will not benefit," Dr John Hick, an emergency physician at Hennepin County Medical Center in Minneapolis, said. For people in the lower tiers of the high-risk spectrum, multiple medical ethicists asserted that society should not begrudge them for clamoring for Paxlovid -- provided they adhere to the FDA's authorization terms and any state rules governing access.

"People are behaving rationally in an irrational environment," said JP Leider, a researcher at the University of Minnesota School of Public Health, who helped craft Minnesota's COVID therapy prioritization guidance. "You should put guardrails on the system to make sure it's going to save as many people as possible and is still trying to promote equity."

For patients who can't get access to Paxlovid, there are other antivirals authorized by the FDA to treat early COVID cases. Merck's oral antiviral molnupiravir has been released in a 4-fold greater supply than Paxlovid. However, the drug is only 30 per cent effective against hospitalization and death and has prompted safety concerns. Consequently, the FDA specifies that molnupiravir should only be used when other treatments are "not accessible or clinically appropriate." Yet healthcare providers may still look to the drug in hopes of taking advantage of even its modest potential benefit, said Michigan's Bagdasarian.

Another antiviral, remdesivir, recently got an expanded authorization from the FDA to protect high-risk COVID patients from needing hospitalization. But because remdesivir requires 3 days of intravenous infusions to treat milder COVID cases, its use will likely remain limited. That said, Bagdasarian suggested that remdesivir may prove feasible for high-risk people with mild to moderate COVID who are in a long-term care facility, psychiatric hospital, or prison, or who are hospitalized for a non-coronavirus reason and are diagnosed with an early case of COVID.

[2] Impact of COVID-19 on education
Date: Tue 1 Feb 2022
Source: World Bank Blogs [abridged, edited]
https://blogs.worldbank.org/voices/we-are-losing-generation-devastating-impacts-covid-19


Governments across the globe will spend about USD 5 trillion on K-12 education (education from kindergarten through 12th grade) this year [2022]. But unless they get all children and young people back to school, keep them in class, and recover the central elements of learning, this generation could lose 2 or 3 times that amount in earning losses.

The 1st impact was the millions of lives lost due to the disease caused by the COVID 19 virus. The 2nd was the human suffering caused by job instability and poverty. The 3rd is on children and youth who should have been in school but were told to stay at home.

It is 2 years since the pandemic started. Nearly all countries decided that one of the main ways to fight the pandemic was to keep students out of school and universities. Public health experts had decided that keeping education institutions open would lead to further spread of the virus. To "flatten the curve" and prevent overcrowding of hospitals, kids would have to stay home.

Many European and some East Asian countries reopened schools relatively quickly, conscious of both the obvious costs for kids and the scant evidence of the benefits of the complete closure. But in many countries in South Asia, Latin America, Middle East, and even in East Asia, school closures were maintained for exceptionally long periods. Our own countries, India and Peru, are tragically representative.

By the end of 2021, school days lost were well above 200 -- that's about a school year and a half. This prolonged interruption in learning could have grave long lasting effects, particularly in middle income and poor countries.

Most of the impact will be on children and youth who happened to be between 4 and 25 years old in 2020 and 2021, generating a huge intergenerational inequality. Being out of school for that long means that children do not just stop learning, they also tend to forget a lot of what they have learned. In late 2020, the World Bank estimated that a 7-month absence from schools would increase the share of students in 'learning poverty' from 53 to 63 per cent. An additional 7 million students would drop out of school. The effects on marginalized minorities and girls will be even worse. Our loss estimates have been revised upwards, and now we expect that, unless swift and bold action is taken, learning poverty can reach 70%.

...

Averting a permanent loss
-------------------------
To help in these efforts, the World Bank Group is working on nearly a hundred COVID-related education projects in more than 60 countries. These projects sum up to USD 11 billion. These are record numbers for the World Bank, but a fraction of the USD 72 billion the US federal government is making available for public schools to reopen safely. We are supporting countries as diverse as Chile, Jordan, and Pakistan. More efforts are needed to finance the return to classroom-based teaching and help public schools adopt teaching techniques that blend online and in-classroom learning and teach students at the level they need today after the months and years they have been denied an education, focusing on foundation skills and in their emotional wellbeing.

The future of a billion kids around the world is at risk. Unless we get them back in school again and find ways to remedy the effects of the interruption, COVID-19 will result in a huge setback for this generation. When the fallout of the coronavirus is finally tallied, it will become clear that its biggest damage is the lost learning of school-goers.

A decade from now, we may look back and find that the biggest permanent loss of this pandemic was avoidable. We can act now and avoid regret.

[Children falling behind and in some cases dropping out is another example of how COVID is contributing to the widening gap between developed and undeveloped nations, and the poor and well-to-do in developed nations. Children are resilient and may recover from the loss of 12-18 months without in-person schooling, but it will take a lot of institutional and financial support. - Mod.LK]

[3] Fact checks

Fact checks on COVID-19 misperceptions are effective initially but do not stick over time

As the COVID-19 global epidemic persists, misinformation continues to circulate widely. Journalists and public health officials continue to struggle to debunk these false and misleading claims, an especially challenging task in the United States, where COVID-19 has become a highly polarizing issue. Are these efforts successful?

According to a new study published in Nature Human Behaviour [see reference below], fact checks can successfully reduce misperceptions about COVID-19 immediately after people read them but do not have lasting effects over time.

"Our results suggest that effectively addressing misbeliefs about COVID-19 will require repeatedly debunking false claims about the coronavirus. Otherwise, people will tend to revert toward the level of belief that they had before," says co-author Brendan Nyhan, the James O Freedman presidential professor in the department of government at Dartmouth.

During the study, respondents from the US, Great Britain, and Canada were asked to rate the perceived accuracy of 4 claims on COVID-19 that have been debunked by scientific and public health authorities: that the Chinese government created the coronavirus as a bioweapon; that a group funded by Bill Gates patented the coronavirus; that antibiotics are effective in preventing and treating COVID-19; and that the medication hydroxychloroquine is proven to cure or prevent COVID-19.

The research team then compared belief in the claims between respondents who were shown the fact checks and those who weren't.

Regardless of when the surveys were administered, the results were the same: misperceptions about COVID-19 immediately decreased in all 3 countries immediately after the fact check was shown to them. Moreover, "the fact checks were most effective among people who are more vulnerable to misperceptions of COVID-19 at baseline," says Nyhan, including supporters of conservative leaders, those with high conspiracy predispositions, and those with low trust in health institutions.

However, these effects did not persist over time in follow-up surveys conducted in the US and Great Britain.

"By comparing US data on the effects of COVID-19 fact checks to that of Great Britain and Canada, we found that our results are parallel across all 3 countries, which suggests that the effects are not an artifact of polarization over COVID-19 in the US," says co-author Jason Reifler, a professor of politics at the University of Exeter and long-time collaborator with Nyhan.

The study is the first to estimate the effects of fact checks on COVID-19 misperceptions over time and across countries. The results provide evidence that COVID-19 fact checks can be effective but that frequent exposure is necessary for addressing misinformation during the pandemic.

------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
"Widespread misperceptions about COVID-19 and the novel coronavirus threaten to exacerbate the severity of the pandemic. We conducted preregistered survey experiments in the United States, Great Britain, and Canada examining the effectiveness of fact-checks that seek to correct these false or unsupported beliefs. Across 3 countries with differing levels of political conflict over the pandemic response, we demonstrate that fact-checks reduce targeted misperceptions, especially among the groups who are most vulnerable to these claims and have minimal spillover effects on the accuracy of related beliefs. However, these reductions in COVID-19 misperception beliefs do not persist over time in panel data even after repeated exposure. These results suggest that fact-checks can successfully change the COVID-19 beliefs of the people who would benefit from them most but that their effects are ephemeral.

Discussion
"Preregistered survey experiments in the United States, Great Britain, and Canada show that exposure to fact-checks decreased the perceived accuracy of targeted false claims about COVID-19 immediately after exposure. These decreases in false beliefs were often greatest among people who were previously most misinformed and/or who were potentially especially susceptible due to political affiliations or distrust of established authorities. However, we find no evidence that repeated exposure to fact-checks increases their effects or that exposure to these claims has durable effects on the accuracy of people's beliefs over time.

"The implications of these findings are mixed. Encouragingly, our results demonstrate that fact-checks can reduce false beliefs about COVID-19 immediately after exposure and that these effects replicate across survey waves and across countries with different levels of polarization. False claims about emerging health issues can be effectively refuted with corrective information. However, our experiments find discouragingly little evidence that fact-checks have enduring effects on beliefs about COVID-19 or are strengthened by the repetition of fact-checks. It is possible that the avalanche of COVID news and (mis)information simply overwhelmed any potential persistence of the fact-checks delivered in our experiments. Under more favourable conditions, fact-checks might create more durable belief change or demonstrate cumulative exposure effects. Further research should test whether these results translate to other health issues outside the context of a global pandemic. More generally, scholars should investigate how to create durable changes in belief accuracy about health issues.

"These results also underscore the importance of cross-national comparative analysis of messaging about controversial health and science issues. The United States is often seen as an outlier due to high levels of polarization, which have hindered its pandemic response and may limit the effectiveness of fact-checking. However, we find similar results in Great Britain and Canada, which are less polarized generally and have experienced less partisan controversy over the response to the pandemic. Moreover, we find parallel erosion of fact-check effects over time in the United States and Great Britain, which suggests that levels of controversy over the pandemic are not responsible for the attenuation of fact-check effects over time that we observe."

This is an informative study that will help get to the root of how best to combat misinformation. The finding that the US is not unique in dissemination of misinformation is an important finding since the common perception has been that it is due to the large political division in the US. These results suggest the problem is larger than that. - Mod.LK]

[A] Monoclonal antibodies
High-risk COVID outpatients least likely to receive monoclonal antibodies
---------------------------------------------------------------
Non hospitalized COVID-19 patients at highest risk for severe outcomes are often the least likely to receive monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), finds a study of more than 1.9 million Medicare beneficiaries published late last week in JAMA(2).

A team led by a Harvard Medical School researcher examined a sample of outpatient, emergency department, and laboratory insurance claims for fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries who received a new diagnosis of COVID-19 or had a confirmed exposure from November 2020-August 2021. mAbs were first available for use in COVID-19 patients in November 2020.

Among the 1 902 914 participants, 7.2% received mAbs. Patients with fewer underlying illnesses were more likely than those with more conditions to receive the treatment (23.2% with 0 chronic conditions vs 6.3%, 6.0%, and 4.7% with 1 to 3, 4 or 5, and 6 or more chronic conditions, respectively; adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 7.43 for 0 vs 6 or more).

Black patients were less likely than their White peers to be given mAb (6.2% vs 7.4%; aOR, 0.77), as were those who were also enrolled in Medicaid (4.6% vs 8.1%; aOR, 0.74). Participants 85 years and older were 42% more likely to receive mAbs than those 65 to 74.

Administration of mAb also varied widely by US region, with Rhode Island (24.9%) and Louisiana (21.2%) administering the most, while Alaska (1.1%) and Washington (0.7%) had the lowest rates. Southern states had the highest rates of mAb use (10.6%), with the lowest rates in the West (2.9%).

The study authors said that patients at the highest risk may have had problems navigating the multiple steps required to access mAb, including a timely COVID-19 diagnosis and referral and booking an appointment for an infusion within 10 days. "In addition, mAb supply may have been low or less used by clinicians in some regions of the country," they wrote.

In a Harvard press release(2), lead author Michael Barnett said that geographic mAb differences may have been influenced by supply levels in different parts of the country. "We need new approaches to prevent these inequities from happening again with newer treatments on the horizon," he said.

[B] Cardiovascular complications
COVID-19 patients at increased risk for cardiovascular complications
-----------------------------------------------------------
A new study suggests patients with COVID-19 are at an increased risk for a variety of cardiovascular complications between 30 days and 1 year after infection. The study, published today in Nature Medicine (1), is based on data from the US Department of Veterans Affairs.

In total, 153 760 veterans with COVID-19 were compared to 2 cohorts of controls. Risk for cardiovascular complications occurred for all patients, including those not hospitalized, but non-hospitalized veterans were at less risk than hospitalized patients, and hospitalized patients were at less risk than those admitted to intensive care units. Strokes, dysrhythmias, inflammation of the heart muscle, and ischemic heart disease were all more frequent in COVID-19 patients.

People who survived the 1st 30 days of COVID-19 exhibited an increased risk of stroke (hazard ratio [HR] 1.52; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.43 to 1.62), for a burden of 4.03 (CI 3.32 to 4.79) per 1000 persons at 12 months. The risks and burdens of ischemic heart disease outcomes, including myocardial infarctions, were 1.66 (CI 1.52, 1.80) and 7.28 (CI 5.80 to 8.88), respectively. The HR for myocarditis was 5.38 (CI 3.80 to 7.59).

"Our study shows that the risk of incident cardiovascular disease extends well beyond the acute phase of COVID-19," the authors concluded. "Because of the chronic nature of these conditions, they will likely have long-lasting consequences for patients and health systems and also have broad implications on economic productivity and life expectancy."

[C] Omicron variant
Omicron strain much less likely to cause severe outcomes
----------------------------------------------
The 1st peer-reviewed US study of COVID-19 outcomes in patients infected with the omicron (B.1.1.529) variant shows that, relative to patients infected with previous variants delta (B1617.2) and alpha (B117), omicron patients were younger, had significantly higher vaccine breakthrough rates, and were significantly less likely to be hospitalized.

The study, published late last week in the American Journal of Pathology (1), also found that, when hospitalized, omicron patients needed less intense respiratory support and had shorter stays, consistent with early reports of the generally milder nature of cases caused by the highly transmissible strain.

Houston Methodist Hospital researchers led the study, which mined the electronic health records of 4468 COVID-19 patients infected with omicron from late November 2021 to early January 2022. Omicron took only 3 weeks to make up 90% of COVID-19 cases after it emerged in Texas in November 2021, accounting for 98% of new infections by January 2022, the authors said.

The median omicron patient age was 44.3 years, compared with 50.0 for alpha and 48.3 for delta. Length of hospital stay was 3.2 days for omicron, versus 5.1 days for alpha and 5.4 days for delta; and omicron resulted in 55.4% of breakthrough cases in vaccinated patients, compared with 3.2% and 24.3% of those infected with alpha and delta, respectively.

Of all omicron cases during the study period, 55.9% met the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria for a vaccine breakthrough infection. There was no clear-cut relationship between time since receipt of the final primary vaccine dose and breakthrough infection.

Two asymptomatic COVID-19 patients were found to be infected with the omicron subvariant BA.2, commonly called the omicron "stealth" variant because it can evade detection by some commonly used COVID-19 tests.

"The present study highlights the importance of analyzing SARS-CoV-2 genome data integrated with patient metadata and stresses the need to continue to do this in near-real-time as the omicron surge continues, the virus evolves, and new variants with potentially altered fitness and biomedically relevant phenotypes are generated," the researchers wrote.

[For those who wish to see the detailed global data, a snapshot of the Worldometer table at the time we accessed it is available at https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/2022%20WORLDDATA%20FEB7_1644313056.pdf.

A 7-day series of cumulative totals reported by countries, territories, and reporting entities can be found at https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/2022%20FEB7WORLD7_1644313069.pdf. It is from this table that numbers in the following commentary are derived.

In the past 24 hours, 36 countries -- the USA (353 372), Russia (171 905), Germany (138 867), Spain (120 818), Turkey (96 514), the Netherlands (77 619), Switzerland (68 438), Brazil (68 540), India (63 319), UK (63 307), Israel (50 878), France (46 001), Italy (41 602), Iran (39 819), South Korea (36 718), Chile (33 839), Hungary (33 716), Denmark (33 013), Austria (27 299), Australia (26 930), Indonesia (26 121), Poland (24 404), Ukraine (23 778), Jordan (21 626), Finland (19 898), Greece (18 847), Norway (17 652), Romania (16 958), Vie Nam (16 815), Canada (16 315), Ireland (15 168), Serbia (11 439), Panama (11 291), Georgia (11 235), Malaysia (11 034), and Thailand (10 398) -- all reported over 10 000 newly confirmed cases. A global total of 10 134 deaths were reported in the preceding 24 hours (late 5 Feb 2022 to late 6 Feb 2022). The exponential rise in cases over the last few weeks can be attributed to the rapid spread of the omicron variant globally. The 7-day averages indicate a decreasing global trend for cases and an increasing trend for deaths.

A total of 85 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 46 of the 85 countries are from the European region, 12 are from the Americas region, 12 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 6 are from the Western Pacific region, 5 from the South East Asia region, and 4 are from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased by 10.1%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 12.5%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 34.1% decrease in daily reported cases and a 1.4% increase in reported deaths.

Impression: Over 2.11 million newly confirmed infections were reported in the past 24 hours; cumulative totals of over 398.09 million cases and over 5.76 million deaths have been reported. Transmission continues at a very high level. - Mod.UBA]
