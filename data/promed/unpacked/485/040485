[Equine influenza is an acute respiratory infection of horses, donkeys, mules, and zebras caused by 2 distinct subtypes (H7N7, formerly equi-1, and H3N8, formerly equi-2) of influenza A virus within the genus _Influenzavirus A_ of the family Orthomyxoviridae. Viruses of the H7N7 subtype have not been isolated since the late 1970s.

While EI virus [EIV] has not been shown to cause disease in humans, serological evidence of infection has been described primarily in individuals with an occupational exposure to the virus.

In view of the very high infectiousness of EIV, contacts of an infected animal should be immediately traced back, isolated, and tested.

For further information on EI, please refer to Mod.TG's commentary at https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=8199359. - Mod.AS
