Health officials in Nunavik [region, Quebec], are trying to figure out the source of a trichin[ell]osis outbreak in Inukjuak [Nunavik]. Since early October [2013], about 15 people have exhibited symptoms of the illness caused by a parasite sometimes found in raw meat of animals Including walrus and polar bear. 2 people have been hospitalized.

Health officials are baffled because there's no evidence that the parasite came from walrus meat, which is most often the cause for an outbreak.

Dr Jean-Francois Proulx, who works for public health in Kuujjuaq, says Inukjuak has had a walrus meat testing program since the 1990s. Walrus meat harvested recently was tested and came back negative. And, he says, the parasite had made people sick even before walrus was harvested and consumed in the community.

"It's a challenge to come to a final answer in such a context but we think that it's important to document as much as we can -- all potential avenues -- in order to contribute to further knowledge on this very rare disease," he said. Proulx says the investigation will continue, but it could take a while.

In the meantime, officials are advising people to fully cook meat before eating it, to kill any parasites. Proulx says the 2 people recently hospitalized seem to be recovering.

[Polar bears and walrus are not the only reservoirs of _Trichinella_ species in the Arctic. The infection is also common in sledge dogs and foxes and is found with low prevalence in seals.

Seals are probably infected by carcasses and offal floating in the water. Thus clusters of infected seals would be a possible explanation for the present outbreak.
