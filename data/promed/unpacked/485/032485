Man with inhalation anthrax had prior lung condition, was exposed to
suspicious soil
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Minnesota Department of Health said today [26 Aug 2011] that a man
found to have inhalation anthrax this month had a prior chronic lung
condition, which may have made him more susceptible to infection with
anthrax, and had multiple exposures to soil and animal products.

The man, in his 60s, had traveled through several states in July and
early August [2011], where anthrax is known to be in the soil and to
have caused infections in animals, including North Dakota, South
Dakota, Montana and Wyoming. He was hospitalized in early August with
pneumonia, was determined to have inhalation anthrax and is now
recovering.

The _Bacillus anthracis_ strain isolated from the patient was found by
genetic testing to be similar to other strains isolated in North
America. No other human cases of anthrax have been reported this
year.

The state health department investigated the case along with the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The patient, a gentleman in his 60s, is doing well and will likely be
discharged shortly. The anthrax strain was determined to be GT59.
Multiple samples (rocks, antlers, boots, car filter, etc.) were tested
and were negative.

The patient did not smoke or use substances. He did not attend a
drumming session. There were stores that he sold antlers, drums, etc.
and he may have handled a drum. He doesn't remember.

He did have an antecedent lung condition. He is a jeweler by hobby,
works with rocks and antlers/bones, but had not done this work in
recent months, and has not received or opened packages with these
materials in recent months.

One bovine case has been identified in South Dakota with a different
genotype. Additional human and animal cases have not been identified.
The patient is recovering and is expected to be discharged from the
hospital shortly.

[Our thanks to Ruth for this informed update.

While I am uncertain about recent GT59 genotypes seen in the US, this
strain was part of the Chinese archive collection specifically
involving Inner Mongolia, Gansu, Shandong, Henan and Hebei provinces.
Over the years various Chinese strains have made their way to the US
in contaminated hides, hair and wool and then get distributed in the
contaminated bone meal from infected cattle downstream of the
processing mills and tanneries.

While on his interstate meander this fellow had been picking up choice
rocks in stream beds and such places -- he is a 'rock hound' -- but he
hadn't split, cut or ground any of them. I presume that the various
samples that Ruth mentions being tested and found negative represented
what he had found, collected, and put in the boot of his car.

In the absence of any hard evidence of how he got infected after a
number of hypotheses have been put forward and wilted, the only one I
can now very speculatively suggest is that he picked up the bones,
maybe a skull, of a dead animal, sniffed it, but for whatever reason
rejected it, and carried on driving. The world is full of shed antlers
and who needs yet another mediocre antler. Rather like our young New
Hampshire lady at a drumming session with contaminated drums that had
been used for decades. She came down from an exposure of minutes while
all her friends had been exposed for hundreds if not thousands of
man-hours exposure without one getting infected. Many are called ... -
