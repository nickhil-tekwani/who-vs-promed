Ulcerative illness in Tilapia and Grey Mullet
------------------------------------
The following data are derived from the January circular dated 12 Jan 2003
from Dr Oded Nir, Director of Veterinary Services [Israel], to fish
breeders, published in the said VSAH Bimonthly Bulletin:
During the last 2 weeks of December 2002, the appearance of an ulcerative
syndrome in Tilapia fish [_Oreochromis spp_] has been reported from the
Beit-Shean/Gilboa areas [North-Eastern Israel]. Examinations carried out by
the State Fish Diseases Officer Dr Avi Eldar have revealed that the illness
is clinically manifested by ulcerations of 1-2 cm diameter, located on the
anterior fins and the gill opercles. It seems that the syndrome is not
lethal. Recovery is spontaneous, the main damage caused being a marketing
problem. Initial investigations at the Ministry's Fish Department laboratory
and at the Fish Diseases laboratory of the Kimron Veterinary Institute, have
not led -- so far -- to conclusive findings regarding the possible etiology
of the condition.
The announcement includes detailed movement restrictions, published in the
Israeli Official Gazette declaring the premises of 22 fish farms in the
Beit-Shean/Gilboa areas as "infected areas". In explanatory text, the
transportation of fish from them to sale points in locations adjacent to
fish farms in unaffected areas is forbidden. As stated, the restrictions
will be maintained until more information on the etiology of the syndrome is
obtained.

as -- seemingly -- affected. Information on similar or related conditions in
Tilapia or Grey Mullet anywhere else will be appreciated. - Mod.AS]
