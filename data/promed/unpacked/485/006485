Anthrax outbreak strikes Oshikoto
---------------------------------
The Oshikoto Regional Health Directorate is hard at work to trace thousands of people believed to have been exposed to anthrax-infected beef. 2 people have already died of the disease and 3000 are said to be at risk of anthrax infection. The regional health directorate has sent officials out in the field to trace people who may have consumed the meat of cattle believed to have died of anthrax.

By Friday afternoon [18 Jan 2013] the Onandjokwe Lutheran Hospital was already swamped by hundreds of people from Omadhiya, a village near the Onandjokwe Hospital and other areas in the Oniipa Constituency where the outbreak was reported. Anthrax is an acute disease caused by the bacterium called _Bacillus anthracis_. It mostly affects herbivores, but it can also be transmitted to human beings, and other animals. Anthrax is deadly and its spores are soil borne.

It can survive harsh conditions and live for more than 70 years after the carcass of an infected animal has been buried. The bacteria are transmitted to human beings if a person with cuts on the skin gets in contact with an infected animal, if a person consumes meat of an infected animal, or if they inhale anthrax spores.

"So many people ate the meat of these cattle. Some were even selling kapana [a mixture of sliced grilled red meat and fat]. That is why we believe that a high number of people are at risk," said Oshikoto Regional Health Director Pater Kefas Angala. According to Angala, some of the people who turned up for treatment were already showing symptoms of anthrax infection, which include a skin rash and stomachache.

Villagers allegedly continued to consume beef from dozens of cattle that were dying 'mysteriously' at the village -- even though they could not explain the reasons for the deaths. The 1st cow died on 21 Dec 2012, and was allegedly skinned by a young man who is a student at the University of Namibia. Angala said the young man has already left for Windhoek, but he will be traced and treated before it is too late. He said the pace at which anthrax symptoms are displayed depends on the amount of bacteria that penetrated the body and probably the victim's immune system. Therefore, some people may react immediately to the infection, while others take some time to react to it.

The outbreak came to the attention of the authorities last week [week of 14 Jan 2013] when a woman in her 60s and her 22-year-old son, both from the village of Omadhiya in the Oniipa Constituency, died after complaining of stomachache and nausea. At first, the relatives of the deceased allegedly refused to allow medical staff to perform a post-mortem, insisting that the 2 died of poisoning. However, health authorities insisted on a post-mortem, which revealed that the mother and son did not die of poisoning but of an anthrax infection. According to Angala, common symptoms of anthrax include stomach pain, diarrhoea, nausea, and vomiting. "That was the reason why the family was convinced that that their relatives were poisoned," he said. After the autopsy results were released, people from the area flocked to the hospital to receive treatment. Angala warned communities not to slaughter, let alone consume the meat of animals that died of unknown causes. He said even the funerals of anthrax victims should be dealt with cautiously.

By Friday afternoon [18 Jan 2013] state veterinarians responsible for the Oshikoto Region were still carrying out tests in an attempt to confirm an anthrax outbreak at Omadhiya village.

[Oshikoto is right up on the northern border of Namibia with Angola. And so what is happening in Oshikoto, could well be happening in nearby Angola.

Namibia normally reports anthrax in wildlife. There were no livestock outbreaks in 2012 and it was otherwise reported in springbok, wildebeest, and burchell's zebra. The last reported outbreak in cattle was in 2008, and in humans in 2007.

The last OIE reported outbreak in Angola was in January 2012, but we posted a report for October-November 2012, (archive no 20121122.1420568) in Huambo province, in central Angola, far from the border with Namibia.
