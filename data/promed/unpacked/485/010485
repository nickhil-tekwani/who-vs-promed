Abstract
--------
Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is a mosquito-borne virus endemic to China and Southeast Asia that causes severe encephalitis in less than 1 percent of infected persons. Transmission of JEV via blood transfusion has not been reported. We report transmission of JEV via blood donation products from an asymptomatic viremic donor to 2 immunocompromised recipients. One recipient on high-dose immunosuppressive drugs received JEV-positive packed red blood cells after a double lung transplant; severe encephalitis and a poor clinical outcome resulted. JEV RNA was detected in serum, cerebrospinal fluid, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid specimens. The 2nd recipient had leukemia and received platelets after undergoing chemotherapy. This patient was asymptomatic; JEV infection was confirmed in this person by IgM seroconversion. This study illustrates that, consistent with other pathogenic flaviviruses, JEV can be transmitted via blood products. Targeted donor screening and pathogen reduction technologies could be used to prevent transfusion-transmitted JEV infection in highly JEV-endemic areas.

[One tends to consider the possibility of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) viremia as unimportant, since the magnitude and duration of viremia is not sufficient to infect vector mosquitoes. This report indicates that there is a risk of transmission via transfusion of blood products from asymptomatic JEV-infected donors. Screening blood for JEV in localities where active transmission frequently occurs seems prudent. There have been sporadic cases of JEV infection in Hong Kong in past years. The virus is endemic in large areas of Asia, including Japan and China. - Mod.TY
