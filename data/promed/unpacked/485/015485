Respiratory disease causing export cattle deaths
------------------------------------------------
Researchers from Western Australia's Murdoch University have found respiratory disease to be a leading cause of cattle deaths on long-haul boat voyages.

A study of 215 cattle, which died on live export ships between 2010 and 2012, showed almost 60 per cent of mortalities were caused by bovine respiratory disease (BRD).

Jo Moore, a PhD candidate from the University's Academy of Pathology, says the results were somewhat unexpected.

"Previous research had shown heat stress was the most common cause of death," she said.

"So we were a little bit surprised, but having thought about it, there are probably a few reasons for it.

"It's probably related to a change in the type of cattle being sent for export since the late 1990s, and the number of government and industry initiatives in place."

The study focused on 20 voyages destined for the Middle East, China and Russia, each carrying mixed breed cattle of mainly _Bos taurus_ origin.

Ms Moore says it's unclear if respiratory disease is also a significant issue in other sectors of the live export industry.

"In regards to the south-east Asian markets, like Indonesia, it's really hard to make direct comparisons," she said.

"Those are a different sort of cattle, they are more often _Bos indicus_, and they are only on the boat for a week or so before they get off at the other end.

"So it's hard to know if the results would be similar in that sort of short-haul situation."

Data collected by the Department of Agriculture between 2000 and 2011 show an average mortality rate of 0.14 per cent on live cattle shipments leaving Australia.

Ms Moore says while the death rates are already low, producers and exporters could do more to reduce disease risks at sea.

"I think they're doing what they think is economically feasible," she said.

"There is more the industry could be doing, and part of the reason that Meat and Livestock Australia and LiveCorp funded this project is because they accept the need for more research to inform management strategies.

"We're hoping that our findings might inform some vaccination strategies that producers can use, or the selection of antibiotics before and during the voyages.

"And of course there are a number of other management strategies that are used, like yard weaning and vaccination on farm, and we think they would be worth looking into."

[The identification of "bovine respiratory disease (BRD)" as the main cause of losses during long-range voyage of cattle exported from Australia is not surprising. BRD is a multifactorial disease, caused by various infectious (bacterial and viral) pathogens combined with stress-related environmental factors. Transportation is the most universally accepted non-infectious risk factor for BRD and led to the long-known layman's term "shipping fever." While economically significant and animal-welfare related, BRD is not an emerging nor an infectious disease.

_Bos taurus_ and _Bos indicus_ breeds are 2 closely related cattle subspecies: _Bos taurus_ breeds are dairy, beef and dual-purpose cattle, mostly of European origin; many of them adapted to cooler climates. _Bos indicus_ are characterised by a fatty hump on their shoulders, drooping ears and a large dewlap; they are well adapted to high temperatures, mainly farmed in tropical countries, often cross-bred with _Bos taurus_ cattle.

According to the data available in West Australia's Department of Agriculture and Food website at http://tinyurl.com/qhw7tev, a total of 195 000 live cattle and 1.72 million live sheep were exported from Western Australia in 2012-13. The major export markets were Israel, Indonesia, Turkey, Malaysia and China. The Australian Government's Exporter Supply Chain Assurance System (ESCAS) has been introduced to ensure all livestock exported for slaughter are handled to internationally agreed (OIE) animal welfare standards and are able to be traced through the supply chain.
