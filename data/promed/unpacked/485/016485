Week of 18-24 Feb 2008
----------------------
- out of the 893 reporting sites, 829 sites (93 per cent) reported data on
AWD [acute watery diarrhea] and water quality.
- all 19 Directorates of Health (DoHs) submitted reports, however Anbar DoH
report was limited to Falluja hospital; data received from Anbar, and
Diyala DoHs was not sufficient in regards to monitoring completeness of
reporting. Excellent progress in reporting from Sulaymaniyah.
- in total, 6426 AWD cases were reported, but none of the 3167 samples
cultured were positive for cholera.
- Baghdad Resafa: reporting of both diarrhea cases and stool samples tested
is showing improvement week by week.
- Basra: Basra remains one of the most regularly reporting DoHs. 434 cases
of AWD were reported. None of the 304 stool samples tested were
culture-positive for cholera.
- Diyala : 54 diarrhea cases reported, 47 stool samples were collected for
culture. Although AWD surveillance is slowly progressing, it is still one
of the weakest AWD surveillance in the country.
- Kirkuk: 235 cases of AWD were reported. None of the 82 samples cultured
were positive for cholera. For the 10th week in a row no cholera case have
been reported from Kirkuk.
- Missan: 80 cases of AWD were reported (compared to 190 last week) (there
is a definite typing mistake in the number of stool samples cultured for VC
[_Vibrio cholerae_] (399) which is almost 5 times the number of diarrhea
cases. Surveillance staff are requested to check the consistency of data
before submission to CDC/Baghdad.
- Mosul: 564 AWD cases reported, none of the 271 stool samples cultured
were positive for cholera.
- Najaf: 478 AWD cases reported, none of the 392 stool samples cultured
were positive for cholera.
- Sulaymaniyah: 595 AWD cases were reported. None of the 125 samples
cultured were positive for cholera. Week by week reporting is improving in
Sulaymaniyah.
- Thiqar, Muthana, Tikrit, and Babylon: 972 cases of AWD were reported.
None of the 450 stool samples cultured were positive for cholera.
- total new confirmed cholera cases: 0

[2] Cholera - Somalia (Gedo)

Dr Abdinur Farah Mohamud alias Dr Karey, the head of Beled-Hawa district in
Gedo region, has announced that the district is affected by cholera. The
district, which is next to Mandera town in Kenya, has been overwhelmed by
heat wave and high humidity, accelerating the clinical effects of the
bacterial infection, according to Dr Karey.

The highly infectious disease has hit the area hard and so far 24 people
have died. Many others have been admitted to medical centers, especially
the district hospital. Dr Karey said that the district authorities have
been alerted by escalating public complaints of diarrhoeic illnesses.

"Stool samples taken from patients to Kenya has proven the prevalence of
cholera causing bacteria," said Dr Karey. The medical office warned that
unless the right steps are taken, the district and surrounding areas would
be devastated.

According to a medical team, the inhabitants of the district and the
thousands who migrated to the area for safety have been affected not only
by cholera but also by other milder illnesses but with harmful effects.

[3] Cholera - Namibia (Ohangwena)

A cholera outbreak has killed one person and infected dozens more in
northern Namibia, where floods that have displaced thousands of people are
widely spreading the disease.

Minister of Health and Social Services, Dr Richard Kamwi, yesterday [10 Mar
2008] said during the past week 72 suspected cases of cholera were reported
at the Engela Health District. Of these, 4 were confirmed as cholera cases.
Engela is in the Ohangwena Region. Yesterday's The Namibian newspaper
reported that the Engela State Hospital had been completely cut off by
floodwater.

The disease outbreak comes as a result of overflowing sewerage oxidation
ponds and VIP toilets resulting in contamination of the floodwater, which
some villagers use for human consumption. "The provision of health services
is heavily compromised by the floods in the northern regions," the minister
said. The ministry has put up a special emergency treatment facility where
all suspected cases should be reported.

<http://allafrica.com/stories/200803090030.html>


Arusha Municipal authorities say the cholera epidemic is still prevalent in
the city and its environs mainly because of poor hygienic conditions. This
was sounded in Arusha by the Arusha Municipality mayor Lawrence Heddi when
he was speaking to the media last week [2-9 Mar 2008].

Heddi told news reporters that the water-borne disease was still a very
serious epidemic in Arusha as 160 people were admitted over the period of
January-February 2008. The mayor gave the break down of victims as follows:
64 males and 30 females came from Sokon I, Muriet, and Sombetini wards.
From neighbourhood areas in Arumeru district, 31 females and 33 males were
admitted. These came from Kiranyi, Ilkiurei, Kioga, and Siwandeti.

A total of 6 people died of cholera in River Oli division in Arua district.
The most affected areas include Kenya, Tanganyika, and Pangisha. Latest
statistics show that 70 cases have been reported since the outbreak began
in January 2008.

The assistant town clerk, Mr Alfred Oyo, said the division lacks funds for
purchasing basic facilities to contain the spread. He attributed the
outbreak to dense population, poor waste disposal, and blocked drainage.
The health team has now embarked on a sensitisation exercise to communities
to have better hygiene and sanitation as a measure to stem the spread

[6] Cholera - Mozambique, Zimbabwe

ReliefWeb, Int Fed of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies report [edited]
<http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/RWB.NSF/db900SID/EDIS-7CEL2Q?OpenDocument>


Mozambique has been affected by a cholera outbreak that hit several areas.
"Cholera is spreading to 8 provinces rapidly. The Tete province is the most
affected. It is flood-related and about 20 people are getting sick per
day," says Ernestina Jama, the Mozambique Red Cross Society's health
coordinator. "A health technician is working there now to support the
volunteers," she adds. These volunteers are carrying out door-to-door
visits to educate people, hand out medicine and tablets for water
purification. But despite all efforts, the situation is worsening. In
Mutarara district, 825 cases have been reported and 14 people have already
died.

Out of 11 provinces in the country, cholera has spread to Zambezia, Tete,
Sofala, Manica Province, Cabo Delgado, Gaza, Maputo, and Maputo City
Province. Countrywide, 48 people died and a total of 4452 people have been
infected.

When the outbreak started in Mozambique in October 2007, 100 cholera cases
were reported daily in some provinces. In Maputo province and in the
capital province itself 80 cases needed urgent treatment on a daily basis.
"That number has gone down to 2 people per day," says Jama. "But in Cabo
Delgado the epidemic is increasing."

Cholera has also spread across the border to neighboring Zimbabwe where the
National Red Cross Society is also fighting to prevent new cases, which
occur on a daily basis in the 2 provinces of Mashonaland Central and East.

Reports indicate that traders crossing the Mozambique border to conduct
informal business may have been infected with the disease, but also the
contamination of water in flooded areas contributed to the outbreak in
Zimbabwe, which resulted in 92 cases of cholera and 9 people losing their
lives.

In Mashonaland Central, the 2 districts of Mt Darwin and Centenary are
affected. In Mudzi District, in Mashonaland East, the outbreak was first
reported at Kotwa Growth Point Hospital and currently 35 people have been
admitted and are been treated.

Reports said on Thursday [6 Mar 2008], 4 more people have died from cholera
in Zimbabwe, bringing the total number of deaths from the disease to at
least 15 in the last month. The deaths come after an outbreak of cholera
was reported in the capital Harare this week [3-9 Mar 2008].

The 4 latest deaths were recorded last week in Shamva, a town in north
eastern Zimbabwe, said the state-controlled Herald newspaper. "We have
already deployed a team in the area to monitor the situation since the 1st
death on 26 Feb 2008," Edward Mabhiza, a senior official in the health
ministry, was quoted as saying. In February, 11 people were reported to
have died from cholera in Muzarabani and Mudzi, in Mashonaland Central
province.
