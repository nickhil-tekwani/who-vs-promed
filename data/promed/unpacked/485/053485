Cryptosporidium in drinking water ­ County Westmeath, Ireland
--------------------------------------------------------------
Up to 10 000 households in the Midlands were put on "boil water"
notice after 13 people fell ill from using contaminated water. A number
of cases of Cryptosporidium have been confirmed in Co. Westmeath.
These may be linked to the public water supply served by Lough Owel.
As a precautionary measure, pending investigation of the possible
source of contamination, a boil water notice is being issued.
Accordingly, in the interest of public health, it is recommended that all
users on the scheme boil the water before use.
Water should NOT be used unboiled for: drinking, drinks made with
water, food preparation, brushing of teeth.
Affected Areas:
Mullingar and surrounding area
Taughmon/Crookedwood
Cloghan Killucan Raharney Kinnegad
Frewin to Irishtown and Longford Road to Ballinafid.
Gainstown, Gaybrook, Knockaville, Coralstown, Milltownpass,
Mahonstown/Gibbonstown, Rochfortbridge.
Belvedere, Dalystown, Tyrrellspas
Ballinea, Dysart, Castletown-Geoghegan, Ballyhast, Ballinagore,
Kilbeggan, Horseleap.
Brotenstown, Rathconrath, Skeagh.
Frewin, Ballinacarrigy, Moyvore, Ballymore.
Bunbrosna, Ballinalack, Rathowen, Rathaspic, Streete, Lismacaffrey.
Important Points:
Water can be used for personal hygiene, bathing, and flushing toilets.
Caution should be taken when bathing children to ensure they do not
ingest the water. Bring water to the boil and allow to cool. Cover and
store in a refrigerator or cold place. Water from the hot tap is not safe
to drink.
Domestic water filters will not render water safe to drink. Discard ice
cubes in fridges and freezers. Make ice from cooled boiled water. Use
water prepared for drinking when preparing foods that will not be
cooked (e.g., washing salads).
This procedure should continue until further notice.

[Cryptosporidiosis is a well-known problem in areas where surface
water is used for drinking. In this outbreak it is assumed that the source
is the lake that serves as the reservoir for drinking water, which must
have become contaminated by human, livestock or other animal
excreta. ­ Mod.EP/JW]
