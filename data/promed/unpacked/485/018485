On 7 Mar 2013 a metatarsal bone from a bovine sudden death was sent to the diagnostic laboratory. The animal had died 10 days previously, along with 2 others that had also died suddenly in February 2013. [_Bacillus anthracis_ was isolated from the sample. - Mod.MHJ] The beef farm is in the Partido of Olavarria, near Estacion Recalde. The herd consists of 130 Angus cattle on natural grazing. The herd had not been vaccinated against anthrax and this disease has not been seen on this farm before. The carcasses were skinned and the ranch hands are at risk since they did not take adequate precautions. Olavarria is one of the major beef breeding districts in the country, and during 2012-2013 has suffered 5 outbreaks of anthrax. Since 2005 there have been 12 isolations of _B. anthracis_ from ranches in the district; see http://www.laboratorioazul.com.ar.

[Yet again our thanks to Ramon for this report. The usual reason given for outbreaks on virgin farms is that outbreaks occurred in the long past and the carcasses were buried and forgotten. As our recovery techniques get better we need to revisit these outbreaks and try to determine what really happened. But it is not easy and can be time consuming. The best way to find old cattle graves is that of Antonio Fasanella who looks for 2-5+ sq m areas depressed by say 20+ cm; the easiest way to find them is after it has rained and they have filled up with water. Take at least 5 soil samples for laboratory processing. Another give away is that there have been soil moving activities in the field, trenching, road, or scrub bulldozing, even discing.

The ranch hands were very lucky. - Mod.MHJ]

This is the 3rd bovine anthrax outbreak in this important beef district in the Province of Buenos Aires; the other 2 occurred on 19 and 25 Feb 2013. This beef ranch is close to Estacion Munoz, on the border separating the partidos of Olavarria and Laprida. The outbreak involved sudden deaths and blood extravasation from the natural openings. The arriving veterinarian found the animals dead and skinned. These were 7 cows, one bull, and 3 large calves, in total 11 animals, from a herd of 120 Angus cows. The animals had been in natural meadow with good grazing. The ranch manager claimed that they had had anthrax 40 years ago. The herd had not been vaccinated.

The carcasses will be handled in the standard manner using "tapado controlado" -- area sprayed with formaldehyde and the carcasses covered with a thick plastic tarpaulin, pegged down around its edges, to await the removal and burning of the remaining bones 9 months later. The veterinarian in charge issued a health alarm because one of the ranch hands was exposed when skinning some of the dead animals.

[Ramon commented as follows: "We have been very busy. This is the 8th anthrax outbreak this year [2013] and as winter approaches we can expect more. It is the 3rd outbreak in Partido of Laprida with the same number in Olavarria. The flooding during the previous autumn-winter of 2012 and this summer's drought have produced special conditions along with a widespread failure to vaccinate the cattle. Recent information being processed indicates that in our Zone of Alert & Response only 14 per cent of the cattle have been vaccinated voluntarily, (85 974 of 601 154 animals). It seems we will continue to find animals dead from anthrax and people with cutaneous lesions on their hands and arms. Without doubt my voice is alone in the wilderness."

A busy time made worse by owners not vaccinating, in spite of being in a high risk area. Our thanks to Ramon.
