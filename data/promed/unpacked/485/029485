[1] Cholera - Haiti
Date: Fri 9 Oct 2015

http://outbreaknewstoday.com/cholera-red-alert-issued-in-haiti-61746/


A Red Alert has been issued in several municipalities in Haiti after a surge of cholera cases have been reported, according to a La Estrella report. The outbreak, reported in the Southeast, has seen 268 cholera cases in the past week in the following cities: Gonaives [Artibonite department], Saint-Marc [Artibonite department], Saint-Michel de l'Attalaye [Artibonite department], Lascahobas [Centre department], Port au Prince [Ouest department], Tabarre [Ouest department] and Marigot [Sud-Est department].

According to the authorities in Haiti, there were a total of 185 cholera deaths from January 2015 to September 2015, among the 22 511 people affected by the disease.

More than half of the rural population has no access to safe water and only 24 percent of Haitians have access to health facilities, according to reports from the Haitian government.

Since the beginning of the epidemic in October 2010 through August 2015, there were 745 401 cholera cases, of which 426 856 were hospitalized (57 percent cumulative hospitalization rate), and 8965 deaths, with a national cumulative case fatality rate of 1.2 percent, according to the PAHO [Pan American Health Organization].

[Haiti continues, despite much overt reporting, to be the top of the haystack for cholera cases, underscoring the continued inability of health organizations to effectively reverse the epidemic. Providing clean, safe water and adequate sanitation can go a long way to help minimize the situation there. It is not likely that _Vibrio cholerae_ will soon disappear from the water there. - Mod.LL

[2] Cholera - Belgium (ex India)

Cholera, Braine l'Alleud [Walloon Brabant province], Belgium
------------------------------------------------------------
On 19 Aug 2015, a 59-year-old Belgian woman was admitted in our hospital for a sudden onset of massive watery diarrhea, associated with vomiting and muscle cramps. Symptoms began on 18 Aug 2015, a day after she had returned from a 1 week trip to India. She had accompanied her husband to a business trip (3 days in Mumbai [Maharashtra state], 3 days in Vadodara [Gujarat state] and the last day in Pune [Maharashtra state]) in very good conditions and reported that she had taken all recommended food precautions, drinking only bottled water, avoiding ice cubes and shellfish. No contact with sick people was reported. Her medical history included mainly a gastric bypass surgery in 2011, and an esophagitis treated with proton pump inhibitors (omeprazole) for more than 10 years. Her blood group is O positive.

The physical examination revealed hypotension but no fever. She was exhibiting features of dehydration, such as oral dryness and poor skin turgor. She did not have abdominal tenderness but she had pain while touching her legs. She was quickly transferred to the intensive care unit for hypovolemic shock with acute kidney failure.

Laboratory analysis showed an elevated serum creatinine level at 7mg/dl (normal range: less than 0.9 mg/dl), a metabolic acidosis with a pH at 7.08 (normal range: 7.32-7.43) associated with a low bicarbonate level at 8 mol/L (normal range: 22-29 mol/L) and a rhabdomyolysis with an elevated creatinin kinase (CK) level at 1283 U/L.
