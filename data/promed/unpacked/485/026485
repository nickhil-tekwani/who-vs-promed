The compounding pharmacy linked to 17 bacterial infections at 2 Corpus Christi hospitals says it has found no evidence of contamination in its building or products.

The federal Food and Drug Administration recalled all products produced by Specialty Compounding of Cedar Park after reports of bacterial infections affecting the 17 patients. 2 patients died. But Texas health officials said previously they'd found no link between the recalled medication and the deaths of those who took it before the recall.

The Corpus Christi Caller Times reported (http://bit.ly/1fMH2BW) Sunday [8 Sep 2013] that a representative for Specialty Compounding said the company hired a microbiologist to do its own inspection of the facility and to test samples -- including swabbing the noses of pharmacists and technicians working there. It found no evidence of the bacterium, _Rhodococcus equi_, found in the blood of 17 people who fell ill at Corpus Christi Medical Center hospitals, Doctors Regional and Bay Area, said David Ball, a spokesman hired by the pharmacy. "There are literally hundreds of potential sources of contamination," Ball told the newspaper. "There's no evidence at this time that the contamination is connected to Specialty Compounding."

A sample of the pharmacy's calcium gluconate showed growth consistent with the bacterium found in patients blood, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in August [2013], citing results from Texas. However, the CDC is still evaluating to confirm that identification. The FDA says the source of contamination remains under investigation. Dr Michael Carome of the consumer advocacy group Public Citizen cautioned against heeding the pharmacy's findings. "One should view with skepticism claims by the company until an independent analysis is done by one of the federal officials," Carome said.

The FDA has said it is concerned about the quality of Specialty Compounding's sterile products and has urged providers not to administer them.

Corpus Christi Medical Center sequestered all of the company's products after a hospital lab technician discovered the same unusual bacterium in blood cultures of 17 patients, all of whom received calcium gluconate.

The bacterium commonly is found in dry and dusty soil, and typically causes infections in horses and goats. Infections in humans are rare.

Calcium gluconate is used to treat patients with high potassium levels in their blood, such as those with kidney failure, to protect their hearts.

[On 11 Aug 2013, the US FDA issued a nationwide voluntary recall of all products for sterile use from the compounding pharmacy Specialty Compounding (http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm364644.htm:

"The US Food and Drug Administration is alerting health care providers and patients of a voluntary nationwide recall of all products produced and distributed for sterile use by Specialty Compounding, LLC, Cedar Park, TX. There have been recent reports of bacterial bloodstream infections potentially related to the company's calcium gluconate infusions.

"All sterile use products produced and distributed by Specialty Compounding are being recalled and none of these products should be used by patients or administered to patients. Facilities, health care providers and patients who have received the products should immediately discontinue use, quarantine the products, and return the products to Specialty Compounding.

"According to information provided by the firm, the recalled products were distributed directly to patients nationwide, with the exception of North Carolina. Recalled products were also distributed directly to hospitals and physicians' offices in Texas.

"The FDA has received reports of 15 patients from 2 Texas hospitals who received an infusion of calcium gluconate 2 grams in Sodium Chloride 0.9 percent for Injection, supplied by Specialty Compounding. Then the patients developed bacterial bloodstream infections caused by _Rhodococcus equi_. These infections are thought to be related to the infusions. Cultures from an intact sample of calcium gluconate compounded by Specialty Compounding show growth of bacteria that are consistent with _Rhodococcus_ species.

"The FDA believes that use of these products would create an unacceptable risk for patients," said Janet Woodcock, MD, director of FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. "Giving a patient a contaminated injectable drug could result in a life-threatening infection.

"Physicians might prescribe calcium gluconate by infusion to treat conditions associated with low calcium levels in certain circumstances.

"The FDA is working closely with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Texas state officials to determine the scope of the contamination.

"Adverse reactions experienced with the use of any Specialty Compounding products may be reported to the FDA's MedWatch Adverse Event Reporting program either online, by regular mail or by fax."

Also, the CDC issued a health advisory via the Health Alert Network (HAN) on 14 Aug 2013 (http://on.nyc.gov/17SSs4q):

"Background
-----------
The Texas Department of State Health Services has reported bacterial bloodstream infections in 15 patients from 2 Texas hospitals who received an infusion of calcium gluconate 2 grams in Sodium Chloride 0.9 percent for Injection, supplied by Specialty Compounding. According to Texas state officials, most infections were caused by _Rhodococcus equi_ and are thought to be related to the infusions. 2 of the 15 patients have died. CDC does not have information that the deaths are related to recalled product. Also according to Texas state officials, cultures from an intact sample of calcium gluconate compounded by Specialty Compounding show growth of bacteria that are consistent with _Rhodococcus_ species. Isolates are being evaluated by CDC to confirm the identification.

"Recommendations
----------------
All sterile use products produced and distributed by Specialty Compounding are being recalled, and none of these products should be used by patients or administered to patients. Facilities, health care providers, and patients who have received the products, should immediately discontinue use, quarantine the products, and return the products to Specialty Compounding (see http://www.fda.gov/Safety/Recalls/ucm364643.htm?source=govdelivery).
If patients who received recalled product are experiencing symptoms, especially fever, they should consult a physician."

_Rhodococcus equi_ is a facultative, intracellular, nonmotile, non-spore-forming, gram-positive, weakly acid-fast coccobacillus. _R equi_ is an important opportunistic pathogen in immunocompromised patients, especially those with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) (http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/34/10/1379.full.pdf). Most patients have pulmonary involvement, which is nodular or consolidative and is often cavitary, even in patients infected with HIV infection (http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/34/10/1379.full). The organism is present in soil and infection in these patients is thought to be acquired by inhalation from the soil. Pulmonary infection is often insidious and clinically resembles tuberculosis or nocardiosis. _R. equi_ is easily cultured on nonselective media but can be misdiagnosed as a contaminant or mistaken for a diphtheroid or occasionally for a mycobacterium based on acid-fast appearance.

Compounding pharmacies are supposed to mix customized prescriptions based on individual doctors' instructions. However, some of these pharmacies have grown into larger businesses, supplying bulk quantities of injectable drugs to hospitals across the country. Pharmacies are licensed and overseen by state pharmacy boards, though the FDA sometimes intervenes when major safety issues arise.

The results of the further microbiological and epidemiological investigation of the current outbreak in Texas, which should include genotyping of the isolates, are eagerly awaited.

Corpus Christi is a seaport on the Gulf of Mexico in the southern region of the US state of Texas. The metropolitan area population in 2012 was 469,134 (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corpus_Christi,_Texas). - Mod.ML
