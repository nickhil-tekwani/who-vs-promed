The CIDC (Central Institute of Animal Disease Control) in Lelystad
[the Netherlands], has doubts concerning the German surveillance in
sentinel animals. According to the last German report to the European
Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health (SCoFCAH),
bluetongue antibodies have been found in 31 sentinel bovines.
According to the spokesperson of LNV (Dutch Ministry of Agriculture,
Nature and Food Quality), the issue was intensively discussed during
the SCoFCAH meeting. It was eventually revealed that the results of
the sentinel surveillance were compromised by the inclusion of old,
serologically positive animals. "And this is not the aim of a
sentinel study". "I have large question marks regarding the German
definition of sentinel animals", says molecular-virologist Piet van
Rijn of the CIDC.
The report presents an overview of the number of sentinel animals
that have been tested during 2007, within the "150-km zone". Germany
has tested a total of 83 857 bovines, originating from 6338
establishments in 12 states. In Hesse, 12 cows were found positive,
in Lower Saxony 15, in Rhineland-Palatinate 3, and in Saarland one.
All examined sheep (594) and goats (108) were found negative.
Recently, Germany has withdrawn from the list 2 'positive' sentinel
animals, since in both cases a different cow was tested [a suggested
interpretation: the 2nd positive cow, was not the same sentinel
animal that was found negative earlier. - Mod.AS]
Van Rijn supposes that the [German] states [Landern] act rather
autonomously. "In relation to the 2 animals mentioned, I know that
the states have published their results before sending the samples
for final confirmation to the reference laboratory at Riems [France]".

[In ProMED-mail's posting "Bluetongue - Europe (09): BTV-8, Germany,
RFI 20070513.1528", which included the data cited above from
Germany's presentation of 3-4 May 2007 to SCoFCAH, we requested
1st-hand interpretation of said data, particularly regarding the 31
positive sentinel bovines, and the opinion of SCoFCAH on the possible
overwintering/recurrence of the virus.
Although this Dutch newswire helps in understanding the background of
the conflicting German data and adds a commentary from a Dutch
expert, the question above remains unanswered. This is a matter of
concern to the relevant northern European countries and, in
particular, the UK. - Mod. AS]
