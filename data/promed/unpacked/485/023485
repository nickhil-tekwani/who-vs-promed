NEW DISEASE OUTBREAKS - OIE
FMD, CATTLE & PIGS - PENINSULAR MALAYSIA
---------------------------------------
On 30 January, in the State of Selangor, FMD Virus Type O was identified by
ELISA in samples from smallholder cattle farms and a nearby commercial
piggery. The virus was isolated from cattle only but it appears to be the
cause of the nearby piggery outbreak. There have been 6 cases in 1000
susceptible cattle and 768 cases in 24 000 pigs. Within country quarantine
is in place and modified stamping out policy has been implemented.

FMD, CATTLE - TAIWAN
--------------------
On 11 Jan 2000, 3 farms in Yunlin and Chiayi prefectures comprising 265
cattle were affected by FMD Virus. The virus is Type O. Results of DNA
sequence analysis: VP1 99% similar to type O/Taiwan/99. Source of
infection is undetermined. Control measures during reporting period
include stamping out, destruction of the milk produced in the infected
farms, vaccination of all the cloven-hoofed animals in the country and
strict environmental hygienic control and quarantine measures, which have
been implemented around the infected farms (within a radius of about 3 km).

NEWCASTLE DISEASE, POULTRY - AUSTRALIA
---------------------------------------
See also: OIE Reports 14 Jan 2000, 31 Dec 1999, 17 Dec 1999, 17 Sept 1999.
Near Tamworth, NSW, a virulent strain of Newcastle disease virus has
affected a pullet rearing facility of 3 sheds of 6000 birds each.
Mortalities remain low (a total of 60 birds in three days) to date, with
nervous signs seen in a small number of birds. There have been no
identifiable high-risk movements onto or from the affected farm in the last
month. Control and surveillance procedures are in place.

FOLLOW-UP REPORTS ON OUTBREAKS - OIE
AVIAN INFLUENZA, POULTRY - ITALY
--------------------------------
See also: OIE Disease Information, 14 January 2000, 31 December 1999, 24
Dec 1999, 28 Aug 1998
The following is a summary of the extent of the outbreak in December. The
outbreak has occurred in 4 regions Friuli Venezia Giulia, Lombardia,
Sardegna and Veneto and has encompassed 9 provinces. Over 2 million birds
have been affected, approximately 70% in Lombardia. There have been 66
outbreaks in layers, broilers and turkeys.
The 14 January report which provides a summary of the outbreak from
December until mid January indicates a total of 124 outbreaks for that
period, so it seems as if early January was a hot time for "high path" AI.

BLUETONGUE, SHEEP - TUNISIA
---------------------------
This report confirm the causal agent of the present outbreak to be
Bluetongue Virus, serotype No. 2. This outbreak was first recognized in 22
December, 1999 (see 7 January OIE report). Seven districts (Ouardanine,
Jemmel, Bembla, Zeramdine, El Djem, Souassi and Sfax South) in the coastal
governates of Monastir, Mahdia and Sfax.
This is the first time Bluetongue has been reported in Tunisia but the
_Culicoides_ vector exists. The clinically affected animals are sheep over
one year old; no clinical cases have been observed in lambs. Control
measures at the farm level, serological surveillance and epidemiologic
survey of all governates has been implemented in January.
