Health officials in Iraq are reporting the death of a person working as a butcher in Mosul city due to infection with Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF), according to a Shafaq News report (computer translated).

The Director of the Veterinary Hospital, Dr. Uday Al-Abadi, said that quarantine was imposed on a number of people that had been in contact with the deceased in a hospital. He added that "we have fogged the meat market in Ras Al-Jada, on the right side of Mosul, because the butcher works there, and we hope that no new cases will be recorded."

The mayor of Mosul, Zuhair Al-Araji, said that this case is the first of its kind recorded in Mosul. He pointed out that this is an issue of great concern and we will impose strict penalties on any butcher who slaughters livestock outside the authorized slaughterhouse. He explained that the penalties would reach prison and the imposition of financial fines to prevent the spread of CCHF in the city of Mosul.

Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever is a widespread disease caused by a tick-borne virus (_Nairovirus_) of the _Bunyaviridae_ family. The CCHF virus causes severe viral hemorrhagic fever outbreaks, with a case fatality rate of 10%-40%.

Animals become infected by the bite of infected ticks and the virus remains in their bloodstream for about one week after infection, allowing the tick-animal-tick cycle to continue when another tick bites. Although a number of tick genera are capable of becoming infected with CCHF virus, ticks of the genus _Hyalomma_ are the principal vector.

The CCHF virus is transmitted to people either by tick bites or through contact with infected animal blood or tissues during and immediately after slaughter. The majority of cases have occurred in people involved in the livestock industry, such as agricultural workers, slaughterhouse workers and veterinarians. Human-to-human transmission is possible.

Iraqi health authorities on Monday [13 Sep 2021] confirmed the 2nd death from the Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) virus. A butcher died from the disease in the northern Nineveh province, a statement by the health crisis cell in the province said. People who came in contact with the butcher were quarantined and his shop closed, the statement added.

The 1st death from the disease was reported in Iraq on 26 Jun 2021.

CCHF virus is generally transmitted from cattle and sheep to humans by exposure to infected animal blood or by bites from infected ticks. Removal of ticks from animals using unprotected hands is often a source of infection. The infection can also spread from person to person by infected blood.

CCHF outbreaks have a case fatality rate of up to 40%, according to WHO. The virus is endemic in Africa, the Balkans, the Middle East and Asia, in countries south of the 50th parallel north.

["The incidence of CCHF in Iraq has not been well described. The disease was first reported in the country in 1979; a total of 10 cases and 7 deaths were reported in the Baghdad area. Several cases were also reported in 1980 in the city of Halabja in [Sulaymaniyah Governorate]. According to published reports, the number of confirmed cases annually, between 1998 and 2009, ranged from 0 to 6; however, 11 confirmed and 28 suspected cases were reported during 2010 in a single province over a period of 3 weeks, with a case fatality rate of 36%" (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971217300656).

In July 2021, CCHF cases were reported in Dhi Qar (a hospital physician), Al Anbar, and Muthanna as well as in Diyala governorates of Iraq, possibly related to increased cattle and animal movement before and during the Eid-ul-Adha (Festival of the Sacrifice) festivities (see See Also section below). The 2 reports above describe the 1st fatal CCHF case reported from Mosul, a major city in northern Iraq, serving as the capital of Nineveh Governorate. The case had occupational exposure to livestock.

It is important to raise awareness about the risk factors of the disease, particularly in the population groups likely to be exposed to the virus, and educate them to take precautionary measures to reduce exposure to the virus, such as wearing gloves and protective clothing while handling animals. - Mod.UBA
