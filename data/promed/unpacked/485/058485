NEWCASTLE DISEASE - AUSTRALIA (NSW) (02)

As reported last week, an outbreak of Newcastle disease (ND) due to
virulent virus of Australian origin occurred in a multi-aged poultry layer
(egg production) enterprise. The infected farm is a small (approximately
7500-bird) multi-cage layer farm near Horsley Park, western Sydney, New
South Wales (NSW). Immediate action was taken to quarantine the infected
flock, collect the necessary epidemiological information to assist
investigations concerning the source of infection and potential for spread;
and develop a detailed emergency response plan.
The affected farm comprised 2 sheds, approximately 75 meters apart, on a
property of approximately 4 hectares. Birds exhibiting clinical signs were
found in 1 shed of 4450 layers 57 weeks old. The non-affected shed
contained 3100 layers 90 weeks old.
Clinical signs of ND were mild, with an increase in mortalities in the
affected shed to 1 to 2 per day (from a base of 1 to 2 per week) and a 17
percent drop in egg production. These signs were initially observed by the
owner on or about 19 Oct 2002. Veterinary examination on 22 and 23 Oct
found a few birds in one section of the affected shed displaying
respiratory and nervous signs.
Records show no birds have moved on or off the property during the month
before quarantine was imposed. Table eggs were normally moved off the farm
direct to suburban retail stores. There are 19 medium-sized poultry farms
within approximately 3 kilometres of the infected farm.
The farm was quarantined on 23 Oct 2002 pending laboratory confirmation of
the diagnosis. After laboratory confirmation on 25 Oct, a Restricted Area
(RA - equivalent to OIE infected zone) of approximately 2-3 km radius
around the infected property, and a Control Area (CA -equivalent to OIE
surveillance zone) encompassing the Sydney Basin, were proclaimed around
the infected property on 26 Oct.
Destruction by lethal injection was completed on 26 Oct and disposal of
birds by burial in an off-site landfill was completed on 27 Oct 2002.
Cleaning and disinfection of the affected property is being carried out in
accordance with the Australian Veterinary Emergency Plan (AUSVETPLAN) for
ND (<http://www.aahc.com.au/ausvetplan/>). Surveillance on poultry farms
around the property has shown no evidence of disease spread. Based on these
facts, the risk of disease spread from this farm has been assessed as low.
Compulsory ND vaccination of any unvaccinated susceptible poultry in the RA
has commenced.
As a further response, Australian authorities have agreed to a compulsory
ND vaccination program within the CA, accompanied by heightened active
and passive surveillance. The rest of Australia outside of the CA
continues to remain free of ND.
Further details on the response to the incident are available on the NSW
Agriculture website:
