[This outbreak was to be expected as Northern Ireland has had, by one
account, 23 notified outbreaks and there have been 12 in Great Britain to
date this year. The difference in numbers reflects more that Northern
Ireland had rejected prophylactic vaccination and therefore had a national
flock susceptible to the disease; they have since vaccinated the national
flock. Discussions with colleagues in the UK (Dennis Alexander at Weybridge
and Leonard Mansley in Angus) revealed that this is still the Scandinavian
wild-bird strain and that virus circulation is probably widespread but with
the disease, not virus multiplication, suppressed by vaccination. When I
spoke with Leonard two weeks ago he had just come from investigating a
Scottish outbreak in day-old chicks seemingly identical with that described
above. The whole shipment was infected with immediate deaths throughout the
house, ie it did not spread from one corner and the chicks would have been
infected at source. MHJ - MOD]
