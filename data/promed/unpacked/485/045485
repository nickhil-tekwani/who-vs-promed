Regarding Samantha Fox's recent misfortune in Thailand, a review of
the medical conditions of 14 000 celebrities reveals that the only
other famous person to receive rabies vaccine following an animal
bite was cellist Pablo Casals. [1]

Stray dogs are the prime cause of rabies infections in Thailand
---------------------------------------------------------------
This article looks to me like an actress's publicity stunt, because
Koh Samui has been officially free of rabies since 1985. See the
following press report. Source: CNN.com, 1 May 2001.

Thai dogs get passports to beat rabies
--------------------------------------
Thailand plans to issue passports to dog owners who want to take
their dogs to rabies-free zones in a bid to ensure the safety of
tourists. So far only 2 islands in Thailand are declared rabies-free
zones -- Koh Samui and Koh Samet.

Koh Samui was chosen because it had not had a single report of rabies
since 1985. All dogs are vaccinated against the rabies virus in the
resort island.

Passports would be valid for 5 years and include information on
rabies vaccinations, record of ownership and a traveling record, a
local Bangkok newspaper reported.

A total of 50 people died of rabies in Thailand last year [2000].
This year [2001] 12 people have died. Many rabies victims get the
disease from dog bites, especially from stray dogs. In Thailand, a
predominantly Buddhist country, the killing of homeless dogs is
generally opposed.

The campaign was initiated by the Livestock Development Department
with the Communicable Diseases Control Department, the Tourism
Authority and the Thai Red Cross Society.
