ANTHRAX - UKRAINE
=================
Date: Fri, 23 May 1997
From: Sandra Rumley <sandie@mindspring.com>
According to the Boston Globe, a Ukrainian village was quarantined after
anthrax was diagnosed in 21 people; two have died. The village of Privolnoye
(Donetsk region) was under quarantine Thursday after a suspected outbreak of
anthrax killed two people and led to the hospitalization of 19 others.
Hundreds of police, emergency and health workers were sent to the area, 350
miles southeast of Kiev, the capital.
Eight people hospitalized with symptoms of cutaneous anthrax work at a
slaughterhouse on the Transportnoye state farm in Privolnoye. The workers
may have been infected by meat they received as pay.
"Clinically, it looks very much like the cutaneous form of anthrax," she
said, but added that doctors were waiting for test results to confirm an
anthrax diagnosis. She said if untreated, cutaneous anthrax can lead to the
often deadly pulmonary form.
Anthrax can infect humans through skin contact, ingestion and inhalation of
spores. It can be treated with penicillin. Infectious diseases have become
more frequent in recent years in the former Soviet Union because of a decline
in the quality of health care in those areas.
