The Massachusetts Department of Public Health (MDPH) announced today that
West Nile virus (WNV) has been confirmed by the State Laboratory Institute
in an adult dead crow found July 22 in a wooded area near Willow Pond in
Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts. The finding of WNV in Massachusetts at this
time is not surprising given that WNV has been found in an increasing
number of birds and mosquitoes in the New York and Connecticut area. As a
result of detection of WNV in Massachusetts, the Department of Public
Health is taking the following steps: MDPH and the City of Boston are
implementing ground level mosquito control evaluation measures including
targeted ground spraying in the area of Boston where the WNV crow was
found. Initiating active surveillance for encephalitis at Boston
Metropolitan area hospitals and screening suspect cases for WNV infection.
To date, MDPH is unaware of any human cases in Massachusetts. Initiating
active surveillance for WNV infections among horses in Massachusetts.
Increasing trapping of mosquitoes at Boston area locations. Reviewing
mosquito control activities with Mosquito Control agencies to assure that
appropriate options for mosquito control are considered, including limited,
targeted ground or aerial larvacide and ground adulticide treatments around
positive WNV findings.
"The Massachusetts Department of Public Health's Arbovirus Surveillance
Program has provided us with an early warning of West Nile virus in
Massachusetts, giving the public and the Department the necessary time to
take appropriate steps to reduce the risk of human infection", said MDPH
Deputy Commissioner Paul Jacobsen. "MDPH will continue to work closely in
cooperation with the City of Boston, regional Mosquito Control Districts
and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on mosquito control and
surveillance efforts."
"The City of Boston Public Health Commission has long had an action plan in
place to deal with West Nile virus should it be detected locally," said
Mayor Thomas M. Menino. "Since it has been determined that the virus was
found in a dead bird in Jamaica Plain, we are moving quickly today on a
public information campaign designed to help people understand the
necessary steps to avoid contact with mosquitoes that may carry the
disease. Additionally, today the city is mobilizing all departments
involved in the upkeep of city parks, fields and water bodies to make sure
these areas are free from standing water, where mosquitoes tend to breed."
The Massachusetts Department of Public Health, in response to the potential
risk in Massachusetts of West Nile Virus infections in May established 7
new mosquito surveillance sites (Boston, Greenfield, Springfield,
Worcester, Northhampton, Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket), which were added
to the regular trap sites in southeastern, northeastern and in central
Massachusetts. Currently, MDPH is trapping mosquitoes at 23 regular sites.
In addition, we are receiving and testing mosquitoes collected by Mosquito
Control Districts in many other Massachusetts towns. It is important to
reemphasize the personal protection measures that citizens can take to
reduce the risk of disease. Check containers and eliminate standing water
in yards. Avoid mosquito exposure whenever possible, and consider using
DEET containing repellents when outdoors in areas where mosquitoes are
active.
The public can obtain additional information by calling the Department of
Public Health at 1-877-603-3572 (number will be activated at 5pm on
7/26/00). Boston residents can call 617-635-3050. For reports of dead
birds, call Local Boards of Health or MDPH at 617-983-6800 for advice on
how to properly handle and submit birds for testing. The State Laboratory
