The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) is informing the public of
its investigation into a possible food link between an _E. coli_
O157:H7 outbreak in the USA, 2 possible cases in Southern Ontario,
and chopped shredded iceberg lettuce from an exporter in Michigan.

The Michigan Department of Community Health and the Illinois
Department of Public Health issued separate public warnings
concerning chopped shredded iceberg lettuce, which may be
contaminated with _E. coli_ O157:H7. Several illnesses with the same
rare pattern of _E. coli_ O157:H7 have been reported in both states,
and the common link is believed to be bagged iceberg lettuce
distributed to several institutions and restaurants by Detroit-based
Aunt Mid's Produce Co. The distributor has voluntarily suspended
distribution of all iceberg lettuce products.

Immediately after being notified of the possible link in the USA, the
CFIA initiated a food safety investigation. The CFIA is continuing to
work closely with the Public Health Agency of Canada, Ontario
Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care (OMHLTC), local public health
authorities, and USA officials on the investigation. CFIA has
contacted all known importers and the trace back of products is
nearing completion.

This iceberg lettuce was imported into Ontario for use in restaurants
and institutions. 2 illnesses with the same PFGE pattern of _E. coli_
as the USA outbreak have been confirmed in Ontario.

Ontario's top doctor has issued a public alert concerning 2 _E. coli_
cases thought to be linked to iceberg lettuce distributed in the
province. Dr David Williams issued the warning in a release Friday
night [3 Oct 2008] saying 2 _E. coli_ cases in the Chatham-Kent area
are linked to the same strain identified in 38 cases in the USA. All
of the cases are thought to come from shredded iceberg lettuce
distributed by Aunt Mid's Produce Company.

The release says the lettuce, which is distributed in 5-pound (2.27
kg) industrial bags, may have been used at institutions such as
hospitals and long-term care homes, as well as restaurants in
southwestern Ontario.

Mark Nesbitt of the province's ministry of health and long-term care
says the public alert is meant to notify health units to be aware
that people may have eaten the affected product.

The lettuce was last distributed in Ontario on 26 Sep 2008 and
because the product has a 12-day shelf life, it could still be in use.

"We want our public health units to be aware that the product has
been out there and it may have been consumed in hospitals, long-term
care homes, and some restaurants," said Nesbitt. "We want people to
be aware that it is out there on everyone to be on alert."

Public health units in southwestern Ontario are contacting specific
restaurants that may have received the product and asking them to
place it on hold, the release added.

[The use of bagged lettuce or spinach is increasingly associated with
enteric diseases. One may look at bagged produce similarly to ground
beef. Instead of a single lettuce (or cow), the bagged (or ground)
product comes from multiple plants (or cows). This increases the risk
of enteric infection.

municipal government in Southwestern Ontario, Canada and can be found
