Tickborne encephalitis vaccine reactions - Yaroslav Oblast
----------------------------------------------------------
Widespread illness has been observed in children in the Yaroslav Oblast
following immunization with tickborne encephalitis (TBE) vaccine. The
vaccine in question is named "Encevir" and has been temporarily withdrawn
from use due to high rates of adverse reactions. The regional
administration of Rospotrebnadzor [the Russian equivalent of a health
protection agency] has stated that adverse reactions affected 70 children
and 10 adults. 49 cases were assessed as moderately affected and the
remainder as mildly affected. Encevir is a product of the Russian
Federation company Microgen, which is based in Tomsk. Currently only a
vaccine of German origin is in use and there have been no complaints
following its use.

Meanwhile tick activity is increasing and has resulted in 750 tick attacks
including 102 attacks on children. 2 suspected TBE cases have been
hospitalized. By contrast, only 56 tick attacks were registered during the
same period of last year [2009]. The risk of infection after tick attack is
proportional to the duration of blood sucking. Transmission is negligible
during the first 24 hours, whereas by 72 hours transmission of infection
occurs in almost 100 per cent of cases. Epidemiologists warn that the risk
of tick attack is increasing and it is not safe even in suburban parks
within Moscow.

The press secretary of the Encevir vaccine-producing company announced that
a commission of experts has not detected any deficiencies or violation of
regulations in the production of the TBE vaccine. He stated that the
experts had visited the production facility a week ago in connection with
similar adverse reactions reported in Chelyabinsk. The acceptable rate of
adverse [events] is less than 9-10 per cent, the press secretary said. The
current rate is about 1 per cent of all immunizations. He added that a
final conclusion will be available at the end of May [2010], but the
experts are already recommending the initiation of clinical trials to
optimize the dosage.

The Rospotrebnadzor has stated that the current low level of vaccine uptake
is worrying. 95 per cent vaccine coverage is the aim for of the population
at risk for TBE.
