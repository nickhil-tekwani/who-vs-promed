Confirmed measles case prompts alert
------------------------------------
Though there's just one case, the Pima County Health Department is
advising all local residents to be on the alert for symptoms of
measles and to review their vaccination records. Health Department
officials confirmed Friday [12 Feb 2010] what earlier this week had
been suspected of being a case of measles. The patient is a baby boy
who is slightly more than a year old and was adopted from another country.

"It is too early to tell whether this will result in further cases of
measles in our community," said chief medical officer Dr. Michelle
McDonald. "Now is the time to be sure that you and your family are
protected by taking the time to review your immunity to measles and
if it is not complete, getting vaccinated." The case is the 1st
confirmed case of measles in Pima County since a local outbreak in
2008 of 13 confirmed and 4 suspected cases.

The baby boy in the current confirmed case did not go to a local
emergency room, say Health Department officials, who did not provide
any other information about the child.

Measles, which can be fatal [although rarely], is highly contagious
and transmitted through the air. Early symptoms include red eyes,
fever, runny nose and cough. Within a few days after the cough, a
rash will begin on the face and spread down the body. People who
suspect a case in themselves or a loved one are advised to call their
medical practitioner before going into the office, to ensure others
are not exposed. People with symptoms should not go out in public
unless they get an alternative explanation for the symptoms, or 4
days have passed since the rash began.

The best protection is through routine MMR vaccinations -- the
combination for measles, mumps and rubella. Children should receive
their 1st MMR dose at 12 to 15 months and the 2nd at 4 to 6 years of
age, no earlier than 28 days after the 1st dose. Older children who
have not been vaccinated should receive 2 doses at least 28 days apart.
