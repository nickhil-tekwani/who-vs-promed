A 28 year old man who worked on a dairy farm in Constancia, a small locality of Paysandu near the capital, [has] died of [a] hantavirus [infection] according to laboratory confirmation.

Olga Rodriguez of the Paysandu Departmental Epidemiology Office explained that this is a virus that circulates in the country, but this is the 1st case registered in Paysandu and the 2nd north of Rio Negro since 2010, when the death of another rural worker in Artigas was reported.

This hantavirus is transmitted by infected rodents and in humans produces 2 types of clinical disease: a type of hemorrhagic fever or severe pulmonary disease. Because of this, reporting to health units is obligatory.

Authorities of the Ministry of Public Health made relevant recommendations and are evaluating the environment due to the possibility that other cases may emerge and "to prevent other healthy people from become ill," it was stated.

[The report above does not mention which hantavirus was responsible for this or the previous case in Uruguay. Although not mentioned specifically, the infections, and certainly the deaths, will have resulted from hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS). Central Plata hantavirus could be the etiological agent responsible for these HPS cases. Its rodent host is the yellow pygmy rice rat, _Oligoryzomys flavescens_, complex of rodents.
