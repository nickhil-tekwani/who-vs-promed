Ecological Impact of West Nile Virus
------------------------------------
First there was the silence of the crows. Then the horses fell ill -- more
than 14 000 this past summer [2002] alone -- along with squirrels,
chipmunks, and mountain goats. Even mighty raptors -- eagles, hawks, and
great horned owls -- dropped from the sky. Now scientists are beginning to
taking stock of West Nile virus's North American invasion, and they are
taken aback by the scale and sweep of its ecological impact. While the human
toll dominated the nation's attention this year [2002] -- the virus killed
at least 241 people and infected thousands more -- the effects on wildlife
were far worse.
The virus swept westward with alarming rapidity, appearing in almost every
state in the nation -- an astonishing expansion for a [virus] that had never
been seen in the Western Hemisphere until 3 years ago. Equally unexpected,
nearly 200 species of birds, reptiles and mammals fell ill as a result of
West Nile virus infection this year [2002], including rabbits and reindeer,
pelicans and bats, even a few dogs and cats. The virus also slammed dozens
of exotic species in about 100 U.S. zoos, killing cockatiels, emus, seals,
flamingos, and penguins. Florida alligator farms lost more than 200 of the
reptiles.
The epidemic has so resembled a bioterrorism attack that the nation's
zoos -- which spearheaded an effort to track [the spread of West Nile virus]
and mount emergency vaccinations -- could end up with potentially important
roles in the emerging arena of homeland security. Just last month, in a
hastily organized effort reminiscent of President Bush's smallpox plan,
officials at 2 California zoos inoculated their endangered California
condors with an experimental vaccine that may be the animals' only hope for
survival.
West Nile virus infection is not fatal in all animals, and over time some
species are expected to adapt. But even partial [declines] in key
populations could have serious consequences. Rodent populations could
blossom in areas where raptors are dying, and pest birds such as house
sparrows may be increasing where crows are absent. The worst is still ahead,
scientists say. Come spring, West Nile virus is expected to complete its
push to the West Coast, home to endangered whooping cranes and economically
important flocks of domestic geese. The virus is also poised to leap to the
subtropics, where rare birds and other vulnerable creatures already face
formidable threats to their survival. "Once it gets to the tropics, where
you've got species already stressed by habitat destruction and you have the
potential for year-round mosquito transmission, some of those populations
are not going to make it," said Peter Marra, an animal ecologist and West
Nile specialist at the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center in
Edgewater, Maryland. "I'm concerned about parrots and hummingbird
populations. There's not that many of them left."
West Nile made its North American debut in the fall of 1999, discovered in a
dead New York crow. Scientists don't know how the virus reached U.S.
shores -- perhaps it hid inside a single infected bird imported from the
Middle East. But one thing is certain, said Stephen Ostroff of the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta: "There's no way that
West Nile virus is going to go away." The virus does not appear to be any
more virulent in Americans than in other people around the world, and
scientists suspect that the US population will gradually gain immunity
through low-level exposures. That is the situation today in countries where
the virus has been active for many years. Most people in those countries
have antibodies to the virus from early childhood, and serious complications
or death from West Nile virus infection are rare.
But in North American wildlife, the virus has proven to be unusually
aggressive and capable of infecting a surprisingly diverse array of animals.
"Most viruses tend to be rather host-specific, but that's not the case with
what we were seeing," said Tracey McNamara, chief of pathology for the
Wildlife Conservation Society, which has its headquarters at the Bronx Zoo
[NY], where the first infected crow was found. It is still unclear how many
of the 200 or so species struck by West Nile virus infection have suffered
significant population declines. But a consensus is emerging that among
birds, in particular, far more species are being hurt than scientists had
predicted -- not just the crows, ravens, and jays that were known to be
especially vulnerable. "There's been a huge die-off of raptors," said Robert
G. McLean of the Agriculture Department's National Wildlife Research Center
in Fort Collins, Colorado.
The experience of the University of Minnesota's Raptor Center, which
rehabilitates sick and injured raptors, was typical. "In mid-August [2002],
we had our first case: a great horned owl," said spokeswoman Sue Kirchoff.
"In September and October, we were just inundated." The center took in 70
ailing birds of prey, including great horned owls, eagles, and red-tailed
hawks. Officials there presume that if that many were found and brought to
the center, countless others died in the wild, with potentially far-ranging
repercussions. "From a biological standpoint, raptors take longer to mature
and have fewer offspring" than smaller birds, said Patti Bright of the
American Bird Conservancy. "Whether they'll be able to rebound, well, we
just don't know." It will take a while longer, Bright and others said,
before it is known whether rodent populations are taking advantage of West
Nile virus's impact on birds of prey.
The evidence for declines in songbirds and other small avian species is less
direct, in part because they are so much less visible. "We're simply not
going to know for a while [about] the smaller birds, because we're not going
to find the bodies," said David S. Wilcove, a professor of ecology at
Princeton University who has been studying West Nile virus disease. Still,
researchers this year found more than 140 bird species sickened or dead [as
a result of West Nile virus infection], including chickadees, doves,
grackles, gulls, herons, kingfishers, pelicans, sparrows, swans, turkeys,
warblers, woodpeckers, and wrens. And while most of those species will
probably pull through as resistant individuals mate and pass their antiviral
vigor to their offspring, ornithologists expect that others will not be so
lucky.
They point to the experience of Hawaii, where the arrival of an avian
poxvirus in the 1890s and avian malaria in the 1930s drove dozens of species
to extinction or close to it. "Those [microbes] just hammered Hawaiian
forest birds," Wilcove said. "That illustrates the potential for harm when a
disease organism encounters a naive population."
Several unexpected aspects of the epidemic have fed Wilcove's and others'
pessimism. One surprise is that the virus can be transmitted directly from
bird to bird, not only via mosquitoes. Raptors can acquire the virus by
eating infected prey, and some birds can apparently spread the virus in
their droppings. There's also evidence that some birds can pass the virus
directly to their chicks while they're still inside the egg.
Another surprise is that West Nile virus can be transmitted directly from
adult mosquitoes to their eggs, so that newly hatched aquatic larvae are
born infected. That could make insecticides, which typically kill only
adults, less effective.
Scientists have also been surprised to learn that the virus can persevere
through the winter, even in many Northern states. Researchers are not sure
which animals are serving as the virus's winter host, but the phenomenon is
allowing the disease to spread year round and is giving the summer viral
eruption an earlier start each year.
Yet another surprise is the number of mosquito species -- 36 at last
count -- that carry the virus. "This is a virus that's never seen a mosquito
it doesn't like," said Ostroff of the CDC. "That's not typical for most
pathogenic viruses."
If that weren't enough, some researchers suspect that West Nile virus might
be capable of mixing its genetic material with that of a closely related
virus, such as the one that causes St. Louis encephalitis, if both viruses
were to infect a single animal. Other viruses have periodically produced
such hybrids, creating in the process an entirely new and dangerous virus.
"This virus is going to spread to the West Coast big time by next year, no
question," USDA's McLean said. "Each habitat is different, but California
seems to be an area that has all the factors you need for a major spread. I
think they're going to be facing major problems in humans, horses, birds,
and other animals. I just don't see any barriers."
Such predictions have a particularly ominous ring for researchers on the
California Condor Recovery Team, who have been struggling to bring the
ungainly bird back from the brink of extinction. They knew that this
summer's experimental inoculations of zoo birds with the horse vaccine --
the only West Nile vaccine approved for marketing in this country -- had
been disappointing, with many birds failing to develop protective
antibodies. So in November 2002, veterinarians at the Los Angeles and San
Diego zoos injected into the thighs of their condors an experimental vaccine
to try to confer immunity before the spring egg-laying season. "We had
absolutely zero negative effects," said Cynthia Stringfield, veterinarian of
the Los Angeles Zoo, and preliminary blood tests suggested that the birds
"had a fantastic immune response." If further tests show that the vaccine
works, the team will try to vaccinate all 128 captive California condors and
the approximately 70 birds now living in the wild.
Zoos may take the lead in the fight against West Nile virus in more ways
than that. More than 100 U.S. zoos and wildlife parks have joined a newly
created information-sharing network, which has its headquarters at Chicago's
Lincoln Park Zoo, to track West Nile virus infection and other emerging
infections in exotic animals. Some scientists suspect the network may even
prove useful in the cause of homeland security, by providing a sensitive
nationwide "sentinel system" for detecting the first hints of a bioterrorism
attack. After all, zoo officials noted, New York crows were dying in droves
in the fall of 1999, but no one figured out that West Nile virus was the
culprit, or that the deaths were related to a spate of unusual human
illnesses, until a crow died on the grounds of the Bronx Zoo. Zoos, it turns
out, take every death seriously -- even those of non-zoo animals on zoo
grounds -- because any death can mark the start of a devastating epidemic.
"Every dead animal is picked up and immediately necropsied," said McNamara,
the Bronx Zoo pathologist. "That's not true in Central Park." When the Bronx
crow was found to be teeming with West Nile virus, it was the first evidence
that the Old World virus had leaped the Atlantic -- and the beginning of the
recognition that an epidemic was already under way in humans. McNamara said
a zoo vet could be the first to know whether terrorists have released a
human or animal pathogen. The consortium is seeking federal funding.
Still, some scientists fear that the nation may soon become less able to
prevent outbreaks such as that of West Nile virus -- whether accidental or
intentional. They said the U.S. system for screening incoming animal, plant
and microbial life -- a patchwork of more than 20 agencies -- has long been
undervalued and underfunded. Now the largest component, the Agriculture
Department's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, is to become part
of the new Homeland Security Department. That's leading many ecologists to
fear that it will narrow its focus to classical bioterrorism pathogens such
as anthrax, leaving the nation more vulnerable to [agents] such as West Nile
virus. "I have a feeling that beetles in imported wood packaging are not
going to be at the top of the list," said Faith T. Campbell, director of the
invasive species program at the American Lands Alliance in Washington. Yet
the recent U.S. invasion by Asian longhorned beetles, which arrived in wood
packaging from China, is expected to cost the nation as much as $669 billion
in insect-destroyed trees in urban areas alone in coming decades, Campbell
said.
Whether West Nile virus ends up decimating many animal populations or
settling in as a mere high-grade ecological disturbance, the epidemic should
be a wake-up call to beef up the nation's surveillance and quarantine
network, said Princeton's Wilcove.
