Jars of lobster meat produced in New Brunswick and sold nationally have been recalled over concerns they may contain a toxin-producing bacteria, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency [CFIA] is warning.

The 285 gram bottles of lobster from the St. Thomas Fish Market are the 2nd product from the company the CFIA has recalled in the last few weeks.

The company voluntarily complied with the recall after a routine CFIA inspection found that some of the seafood products may contain the bacteria. There have been no illnesses reported, the agency said.

A total of 7 code lots of lobster have been recalled: 13921, 14021, 19121, 19521, 20221, 20521 and 20822. The UPC code for the cans is 0 81971 90072 8.

In March [2013], jars of bar clams produced at the Bouctouche facility were recalled because there was a chance the products contained _Clostridium botulinum_. Toxins produced by the bacteria can cause botulism, a life-threatening illness. Food contaminated with these bacteria might not look or smell spoiled.

The CFIA could not confirm the manufacture date of the recalled products, but a spokesperson for the agency said the recalled production lots go back a number of months.

Because of the potential severity of botulism, ProMED-mail posts such recalls even if, as in this case, there are no human cases associated (yet) with the food products. Most of the food recalls are related to defective preparation procedures, which could, but not necessarily do, result in the germination of viable spores of _Clostridium botulinum_. - Mod.LL
