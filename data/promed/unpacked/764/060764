The ministry of health in Kavango West and Kavango East regions has reported about 827 malaria cases, while inhabitants are being encouraged to use mosquito repellents to curb the spread.

"We are having cases, but we are not in an outbreak; we are keeping it under control, but the cases that we have now are more than what we had last year [2019]. Remember we experienced low rainfall last year," said the regional chief medical officer for the 2 Kavango regions, Dr. Abiola Adesina.

Adesina said in 2019 the 2 Kavango regions had only less than 200 combined cases; for this year [2020] starting in January to last week Friday [3 Apr 2020], the 2 regions reported a combined 827 cases, 4 times than last year.

"The malaria prevention programme in the 2 Kavango regions is running well, and it's one of our priorities. Our field officers are busy doing their work in all our districts," he said.

"We have an integrated programme; we combine vector control with case detection and management, which means we treat malaria patients and we follow up their contacts and test them as well and we also spray their houses if they have not been sprayed yet, amongst other measures," he continued.

We are busy with continuous health education in communities: To stop the increase of malaria cases, Adesina encouraged communities to take the ministry's health education program seriously and cooperate with their officers who are busy with indoor residual spraying. "Sleep under treated mosquito nets, and if you have malaria symptoms you should go to the nearest health facility; make sure to take care of your environment, ensure there's no standing water even in unused and open containers, de-bush surroundings, and while fighting malaria we should also note COVID-19 -- stay at home and take care," he said.

[The Kavango districts are endemic for malaria. According to the WHO World Malaria Report (https://www.who.int/publications-detail/world-malaria-report-2019), the annual incidence is around 200 to 300 cases per 1000 population (WHO World Malaria Report, Annex 2A). The registered number of malaria cases increased from 12 168 in 2015 to 30 567 in 2018. Only around 40% of the population living in risk areas use an insecticide-treated net (ITN), and 98% of the cases are _Plasmodium falciparum_. - Mod.EP
