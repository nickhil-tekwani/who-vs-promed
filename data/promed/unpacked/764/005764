[This immediate notification complements the information already covered in ProMED-mail posting 20190219.6324979. Unfortunately, due to the situation of ASF in China it is not a surprise that ASF is now detected in Viet Nam.

The 2 affected provinces, Hung Yen and Thai Binh are located southeast of Hanoi in northern Vietnam approximately 100 miles (160 km) from the Chinese border. See map at https://umnswinenews.com/2019/02/19/african-swine-fever-asf-reported-in-vietnam/.

"Recently, on 15 Feb 2019, Taiwanese authorities communicated that ASF was detected in seized pork products, presumably from Vietnam, at the Tainan airport. According to Taiwanese authorities, since late August 2018 they have been testing samples of pork products from foreign countries. From a total of 928 tested samples, 20 samples have been found to be ASF-contaminated. All positive samples originated from China, until this 1st case of a confiscated product of a passenger entering Taiwan on an airline coming from Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.

"On 15 Feb 2019, FAO updated the ASF Situation site (http://www.fao.org/ag/againfo/programmes/en/empres/ASF/situation_update.html), detailing that the gene sequence showed 100% similarity with the ASF virus in China, but the exact source of the meat was unknown. As of today, it has been speculated that the most likely route of introduction into Vietnam was through smuggling of contaminated pork products from China, based on volumes and price differentials between the 2 countries, which generated a positive gradient of pork products into Vietnam illegally.

"Also, today the 1st case of ASF was reported in the Chinese province of Guangxi (see ProMED-mail 20190220.6326894), making a total of 26 provinces affected by the disease since last August 2018. Guangxi is one of the 2 Chinese provinces bordering Vietnam. The other neighboring province, Yunnan, reported its 1st ASF case last October. 2018 So far this year (2019), ASF has been reported in 2 countries that share borders with China, Mongolia and Vietnam, demonstrating the challenge that ASF represents to the entire region".
