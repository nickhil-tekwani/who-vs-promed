[1] Egypt (Beni Suef)
Date: Mon 15 Dec 2014
From: Abdallah Samy <samyasu@aol.com> [edited]


New measles cases have been reported in different areas of Egypt. For a few weeks, all measles cases were only reported in Marsa Matrouh province. Most of these cases were identified from Siwa Oasis.

Yesterday [14 Dec 2014], the disease appeared in another area, where a child died from measles in Beni Suef Province. The cases are still underestimated, but they should raise an alarm, with high risks of contracting measles now in Egypt.

The Ministry of Health regulations should be offered to people through local mass media, especially in infected areas, and give information on how they can report symptoms as soon as possible to the health authorities.

7 provinces have reported outbreaks of measles, but the Health Department does not regard the resurgence as a crisis.

1st reports said the outbreaks were in Gauteng, Mpumalanga, KwaZulu-Natal, Northern Cape and Western Cape. But now the National Institute for Communicable Diseases says there has been an increase in laboratory-confirmed measles cases in 2 more provinces, Eastern Cape and Free State. Institute spokesman Nombuso Shabalala said: "Measles vaccines are safe and highly effective at preventing it."

The Gauteng health department urged parents to take children to the nearest clinic for a measles vaccination. It said it had introduced a campaign to vaccinate children between 6 months and 15 years. Spokesman Prince Hamnca said: "During the festive season, the movement of people will pose a risk to the containment and prevention of the disease. It's for this reason that the department urges all parents to ensure that their children are vaccinated."

National Health Department spokesman Popo Maja said it was worried about the current outbreak, "but it is not a crisis. The national institute is monitoring the situation and advising us."

[3] South Africa (NICD alert)
Date: Mon 15 Dec 2014

The National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) has issued an alert, warning of a measles outbreak in South Africa.

A significant increase in the number of measles cases reported was "concerning," the National Institute for Communicable Diseases said. "In the last couple of months, there has been an increase in measles cases in the country," the institute's spokeswoman, Nomusa Shabalala, said.

She said there had been 18 cases in Northern Cape, 10 in Gauteng, 4 in Western Cape and 6 in KZN (KwaZulu-Natal). "Last year [2013], there were only 6 cases for the whole of South Africa. This increase is concerning, as in 2009-2011, South Africa had a large measles outbreak with 18 000 cases, and we don't want to see this again," Shabalala said.

The chairman of the People's Health Movement, Louis Reynolds, said: "Measles is a severe disease. It has severe complications." He said that if immunisation coverage dropped, then there was always the risk of an outbreak, especially among the poorer parts of the country.

Another factor that complicated measles infection was that among "rich people," it was "fashionable not to immunise their children, Reynolds said. This was done in the belief that not immunising their children would strengthen the children's immune systems. Reynolds said the government's measles immunisation programme was not as good as it should be.

According to the World Health Organization, measles is one of the leading causes of death among young children, even though a safe and cost-effective vaccine is available. The organisation said there were 145 700 measles deaths globally last year [2013].

The KZN Department of Health has, however, denied there was an outbreak. "There is no outbreak of measles in KZN. Six cases have been diagnosed and treated so far: one in Ugu, one in Uthungulu, one in Umkhanyakude, one in Umgungundlovu, and 2 in eThekwini," the department's spokesman, Sam Mkhwanazi, said. "These are sporadic cases in different geographical areas, which means they are not an outbreak."

Mkhwanazi said the department had had an "intensive" immunisation campaign in August 2014, during which it had identified children whose immunisation was not up to date, and it was updated. He said that in the majority of the measles cases, the patients had defaulted in their treatment. Mkhwanazi urged parents and guardians to ensure their children were immunised.

[4] USA (CDC alert)
Date: Fri 19 Dec 2014

http://www.hcplive.com/articles/CDC-Measles-Cases-at-Airport-Highlight-Ease-of-Transmission


Traveling through the same US airport gate, one infected passenger transmitted measles virus to 3 others within a 4-hour time span, illustrating just how easily the virus can spread. These findings were reported in the 19 Dec 2014 issue of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. The measles "cluster" of cases originated at one gate at an unnamed US international airport, according to the report. Transmission likely occurred on Fri 17 Jan 2014. The gate in question was located in a terminal that only serviced domestic flights.

The 1st patient outlined in the report was a 21-year-old man. He developed a measles rash on 1 Feb 2014 and had traveled on 2 domestic flights that connected at the airport about 2 weeks beforehand, on 17 and 18 Jan 2014. Patient 2 was a 49-year-old man who also developed a measles rash on 1 Feb 2014. He had reported traveling from the airport on 17 Jan 2014. A 3rd patient, aged 19, came down with the measles rash on 30 Jan 2014. He said he had spent 4 hours on a layover in the airport on 17 Jan 2014 as well. Finally, patient 4, a 63-year-old man, developed a measles rash on 5 Feb 2014. He had also traveled through the airport on 17 Jan 2014.

"The exposures in this report were not prolonged and occurred in a domestic rather than an international terminal, highlighting the fact that measles is highly contagious," the authors write. They stressed that: "Measles continues to pose a risk for infection among unvaccinated persons in the United States."

None of the 4 people infected had been vaccinated.
