The Philadelphia Department of Public Health announced an outbreak of _E. coli_ infections that have sickened 14 people so far. In a statement released [Thu 5 Sep 2019], city health officials said their ongoing investigation "has identified a few shared restaurant exposures." They have not named specific restaurants. All 14 affected people, ranging in age from 7 to 90 years old, "presented with signs of acute gastroenteritis with bloody and non-bloody diarrhea," according to the statement. The cases have been reported since [30 Aug 2019].

The health department said the illnesses were due to Shiga-toxin _E. coli_. Symptoms usually start with non-bloody diarrhea, which can progress to bloody diarrhea after 2 to 3 days. Severe abdominal pain without much fever may also occur. Exposure to the bacteria often occurs through contact with food or water contaminated by human or animal stool or through contact with an infected person. Outbreaks have been associated with consuming undercooked beef, unpasteurized milk, or raw leafy vegetables, as well as exposure at petting zoos.

A significant possible complication of this strain of _E. coli_ exposure is hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS) -- a condition that affects the blood vessels in the kidneys -- which can cause hemolytic anemia, low platelets and acute renal dysfunction. HUS usually develops 7 to 14 days after diarrhea begins and can result in kidney failure, seizures, coma or death. About 6% of the people infected by the _E. coli_ strain will develop HUS, according to the health department. Children ages 1 to 4 are at highest risk for HUS.

Doctors and health providers are being asked to test for Shiga-toxin and _E. coli_ in all patients presenting with acute gastroenteritis and notify the health department of confirmed cases. People with suspected infection from this _E. coli_ strain should not take antimicrobials; they may increase the risk of HUS.

[It is important to understand that there are many different kinds of _E. coli_. The organism is an important component of the human intestinal tract and can perform important functions helpful to its host. These strains can cause human infections if they "escape" from the usual location into the urinary tract, gall bladder, or abdominal cavity. They are also what are mentioned when a beach is closed for _E. coli_ contamination. In this circumstance, officials are measuring the organism or "coliforms" in the water to reflect human sewage contamination.

In addition, some strains of _E. coli_ can produce toxins that can induce diarrhea, and much of so-called travelers' diarrhea is caused by these strains. All of these strains are human bacteria, not zoonotic organisms, that is, not spread from animal hosts. One _E. coli_ group called Shiga toxin producing or enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ (EHEC), the organism likely to be involved here, is zoonotic. Spread in a number of ways, including via undercooked ground beef, contaminated vegetables, and direct or direct contact with farm animals including contaminated water, EHEC can cause significant disease and even death. - Mod.LL
