[1] Asian soybean rust - USA (Oklahoma): 1st report

Asian soybean rust was confirmed for the 1st time in Oklahoma on a
leaf sampled from a sentinel plot in Bryan County on 13 Jul 2007,
making Oklahoma the 8th state with rust this year [2007]. Soybeans in
Choctaw County were found to have rust 2 days ago.
The 2 counties are in southeastern Oklahoma, directly across the
border from rust-positive Fannin County in Texas and only 2 counties
west of rust-positive Little River County in Arkansas. This is the
farthest north soybean rust has been found in the U.S. this year [2007].
According to the Oklahoma state commentary that reported the finds
today: "Rust was found for the 1st time in Oklahoma on a sentinel
plot sample taken on 13 Jul 2007 from Bryan Co. (south of Bennington)
on one of 100 leaves sampled. By 23 Jul 2007, rust increased to an
incidence of about 20 percent of sampled leaves in the sentinel plot.
On 23 Jul 2007, rust was also found in a nearby commercial field at
an incidence level of 10 percent.
"In adjacent Choctaw County, rust was found in a commercial field
(near Frogville) at an incidence of one percent on 24 Jul 2007. Rust
has not been found in the sentinel plot, kudzu, and in other
commercial fields in Choctaw County. Positive finds have been in
soybeans at the R4 to R5 growth stages."
Sentinel plots in Atoka, Ottawa, Payne, Sequoyah, Tulsa, and
Washington Counties remain negative for rust this week, the report
said. Rust also has not been found in observational samples taken
from commercial fields in Garvin, Pottawatomie and Le Flore Counties.
"While rains have subsided, conditions remain favorable for rust
development this week with moderate daytime temperatures, high
humidity and night time dews," according to the commentary. "Other
diseases, such as downy mildew, brown spot, bacterial blight, and
frogeye leaf spot, are widespread and make rust recognition difficult."
Oklahoma officials said fungicide sprays are recommended to protect
soybeans from rust in affected counties and nearby counties to the
north when soybeans are in the R1 to R5 growth stages. The decision
to spray at late R5 is a judgment call. Check soybeans periodically
and submit suspect samples to local County Ag Educators for
submission to the OSU Plant Disease and Insect Diagnostic Laboratory.
As of 26 Jul 2007, early maturing varieties (MG3 and MG4) are at R3
to R5 growth stages in Oklahoma, while full-season varieties (MG5 and
MG6) are at various vegetative stages.
These finds bring the U.S. total of counties and parishes with
soybean rust in 2007 to 45 in 8 states: Texas 15, Florida 10,
Louisiana 6, Alabama 5, Georgia 5, Oklahoma 2, Arkansas 1, Mississippi 1.
On this date last year [2006], only 26 counties and parishes in 5
states had soybean rust, and it had gone no farther west than Rapides
Parish, Louisiana and no farther north than Montgomery County, Alabama.

During the last 2 seasons, we projected that the risk of soybean rust
(SBR) was no longer a concern when June ended. This season is
different from last year [2006], because we received more rain early
in the growing season, and the disease progressed much faster in the
South than during the last 2 years.
Below is an update on the movement of SBR in the 2 northward pathways
and an outlook for the rest of the growing season.
Eastern region and Mississippi River pathway
----------------------------------------
For the southeastern region, SBR is progressing slowly due to the dry
conditions from spring into early summer. The spores from that region
will no longer be a threat to soybean production areas west of the
Appalachian Mountains because of prevailing winds this summer [2007].
In Louisiana, since the detection of soybean rust in the central part
of the state (a month earlier than last year [2006]), no new
northward development has been reported. Into July 2007, SBR in
Louisiana will not be a concern as a source of spore production
because the weather will be too hot for soybean rust development.
However, there is a good possibility that spores were blown to
regions north of Louisiana before July 2007, as suggested by our
computer models.
Western pathway
---------------
SBR was found in northern Texas in several counties last week. It was
said to be widespread in northern Texas, based on their Web reports,
and fungicide application has been recommended in that area.
During Monday's national teleconference, more SBR was reported in
northern Texas, and the disease also was found in southwestern
Arkansas in the area next to northeastern Texas. The possibility of
SBR occurrence in northern Texas had been predicted by computer
models for the week after 19 May 2007. If the spores landed in that
timeframe, it took a month for the disease to develop to detectable
levels and a few more weeks to achieve a widespread level.
Computer prediction maps also suggested that spore clouds had spread
to Oklahoma in early June 2007, and there were plenty of rains from
spring to early summer, setting the stage for soybean rust development.
Outlook
-------
The occurrence of soybean rust in northern Texas increases the
possibility for viable spores to spread to northern production
regions. Computer models suggest that soybean rust spores could be
blown as far north as central Illinois in August 2007 in an effective
concentration.
It is likely that more soybean rust will be found north of Texas in
the western pathway of soybean rust during the remainder of the
season. An increase in disease intensity in this pathway should
increase the possibility of spore movement to Iowa, especially to
southeastern Iowa. We need to watch the situation closely, because
favorable conditions are predicted in that region for the next 30 days.
With the current information, the risk of having an SBR outbreak in
Iowa severe enough to reduce soybean yield is low to moderate for the
rest of the growing season, as suggested by our latest computer
predictions. Average precipitation has been predicted for Iowa and
surrounding states for the next 30 days by the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration Climate Center. Our computer model also
predicts that there is less than 40 percent favorability for the
occurrence of soybean rust in the next 30 days.
We will continue to monitor the occurrence of SBR in the South and in
the western pathway, and update our outlook as new developments arise.

[The fungus _Phakopsora pachyrhizi_ was identified in Japan in 1902
as the cause of soybean rust. It can cause premature defoliation,
with yield losses of up to 70 percent reported on farms in Asia. It
is widespread in Asia and Africa, but data are lacking concerning its
establishment in Europe. The 1st detection of _P. pachyrhizi_ in the
New World was in Paraguay in 2001, and it was introduced into the USA
in 2004. New strains of _P. pachyrhizi_ with increased virulence are
emerging, and weed species can serve as pathogen reservoirs.
The system of soybean growth stages divides plant development into
vegetative (V) and reproductive (R) stages. The vegetative stages are
numbered according to how many fully-developed trifoliate leaves are
present. The reproductive (R) stages begin at flowering and include
pod development, seed development, and plant maturation. The stages
can overlap. The stages above are: R1 - beginning of flowering; R3 -
beginning of pod development; R5 - beginning of seed set.
The other soybean diseases mentioned are: frogeye leaf spot which is
caused by the fungus _Cercospora sojina_ and can infect leaves,
stems, and seeds of soybean; downy mildew which is caused by the
fungus _Peronospora manshurica_; bacterial blight caused by
_Pseudomonas syringae_ pv. _glycinea_ or _P. savastanoi_ pv.
_glycinea_ (there is still some debate whether these are distinct
species or different strains of _P. syringae_); and brown spot which
is a fungal disease caused by _Septoria glycines_.
