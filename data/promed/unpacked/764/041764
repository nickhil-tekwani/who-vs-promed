[2] Pakistan (Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Balochistan) alert
Date: Thu 6 Aug 2015
Source: Dawn [edited]
http://www.dawn.com/news/1198741/two-dengue-cases-detected-in-mingora


The anti-dengue campaign was accelerated in the high-risk areas after 2 dengue fever cases were recorded here on [Wed 5 Aug 2015].

The 1st suspected dengue patient, identified as [a person] from the Rajaabad area of Mingora [a city in Swat district, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province], was admitted to the Saidu Teaching Hospital (STH) on [Tue 4 Aug 2015] and the 2nd patient was brought to the hospital on [Wed 5 Aug 2015] from the Amni area of Shangla district.

[The 2nd patient] was working in a coalmine in Balochistan [province] where he contracted dengue fever. "I went to medical technicians in Balochistan who give me different injections, but my fever got severe and I returned home. My family members immediately brought me to the STH where it has been detected as dengue fever," said [the patient].

Regarding the 1st case, district health officer (DHO) Dr Syed Ali Khan told Dawn that the blood sample of [the patient] had been sent to the National Institute of Health, Islamabad, for confirmation. "When the dengue case was notified we sent the rapid response team to check his house and surrounding area. Though his house was clean, larvae were found in water pots in his neighborhood which were destroyed," the DHO said.

He said that afterwards a full activity was conducted in which breeding spots were destroyed and fogging carried out in the entire area. He claimed that the district health department had enough resources to tackle the problem.

A dengue epidemic occurred in Swat for the 1st time in 2013, when more than 9000 people were infected. According to official figures, 32 dengue patients died at that time [2013]. In 2014, only 310 cases were registered, while no casualties were recorded due to dengue in Swat. In 2013, the 1st dengue case was reported in August and the following year [2014] the 1st case was recorded in June. The current dengue case in Mingora is the 1st of the year [2015] in Swat.

[2 dengue cases have been reported from Mingora city in Swat district, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (KP). However, the 2nd case contracted the disease in Balochistan province and was later brought to the hospital in KP when his condition worsened. The local health authorities sent a rapid-response team to the 1st patient's home to look for mosquito-breeding places. All breeding places and larvae have been destroyed. These 2 cases are the 1st reported dengue cases from Swat district in 2015. More cases are likely to be detected from the district. Regular vector-control measures and public awareness is needed to prevent bigger outbreaks in the district.

Mingora is the largest commercial city in Swat district, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province. For the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map of Pakistan, see https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=3569950,140. - Mod.SN]
