WEST NILE VIRUS UPDATE 2003 - USA (24)

[Now that the West Nile virus (WNV) surveillance data reported to CDC
through ArboNET are appearing weekly in MMWR, ProMED-mail will no longer
provide abstracted information from the USGS West Nile virus maps. A
summary map of the current situation is reproduced in MMWR, and the more
detailed USGS maps, down to county level in some categories, can be
accessed via <http://westnilemaps.usgs.gov> for anyone requiring such
detailed information.
Now that the 2003 West Nile virus season is in full swing, only extensions
of West Nile virus geographic range or host species, and exceptional items,
will be posted separately from these weekly updates. - Mod.CP]

A correction
------------
The Moderator's comment appended to the previous update (West Nile virus
update 2003 - USA (23) 20030905.2227) stated incorrectly that: "The states
that remain free of cases of West Nile virus infection in humans and other
animals are Hawaii, Alaska, Idaho, Nevada, and Oregon."
In fact West Nile virus infection was confirmed in a horse in southwestern
Idaho in 2002 (see:
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvbid/westnile/surv&control03Maps02.htm> and
<http://cindi.usgs.gov/hazard/event/west_nile/usa_vet_apr_22.html>).
The only U.S. states with no confirmed cases of autochthonous West Nile
virus infections are Hawaii, Alaska, Nevada, and Oregon.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr. Dudley for pointing out this error. A single human
cases of West Nile virus infection was reported in Idaho in 2002 and
another in 2003, but both were judged to be travel-related and not
indigenous cases. The 2002 equine case is a curiosity in that it was
located in a county in southwestern Idaho some distance to the west of
other confirmed equine cases. - Mod.CP]

Colorado: Estimation of West Nile Case Numbers from Positive Blood Donors
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
More than 150 Colorado blood donors initially tested positive for West Nile
virus infection, an indication that more than 35 000 people statewide might
be infected with the mosquito-borne virus.
Since 1 Jul 2003, 1152 donors at Bonfils Blood Center tested positive for
West Nile virus infection, said spokeswoman Paige Van Riper. 88 percent
were confirmed West Nile virus-positive in follow-up tests. The rate of
positive tests accelerated sharply in August -- 111 positives out of 16 000
donors. Assuming 88 percent of them are confirmed positive, slightly less
than 1 percent of August donors had West Nile virus infections.
Extrapolated to Colorado's population of 4.3 million, that means about 35
000 people statewide may have the virus in their bodies.
An estimated 70 to 80 percent of infected people do not display any
symptoms, health officials say. "I can believe, based on what we've seen,
that it could be 35 000," said Dr. William Dickey, president of the Bonfils
Blood Center. "Our donors probably do represent a cross-section of
Coloradans." Colorado leads the nation in cases and deaths so far in 2003.
But John Pape, epidemiologist with Colorado Department of Public Health and
Environment, cautions there are too many unknowns to make assumptions. He
disagrees, for example, that blood donors are a random sampling of
Coloradans, saying donors tend to be older and predominantly male.
Still, other comparisons indicate that there may be even more than 35 000
Coloradans infected, and that by the end of 2003 it could exceed 100 000.
For example, Ohio's Cuyahoga County, which has about 1/3 the population of
Colorado, had 219 cases and 10 deaths from West Nile in 2002. At the end of
2002, Cuyahoga County tested 1200 randomly selected residents and found an
infection rate of 5 percent, said John Romano, member of the Cuyahoga
County Board of Health.
Health officials do not have a good handle on how many Americans are
infected. But if Colorado's infection rate is 5 percent at the end of 2003,
that would mean more than 200 000 state residents will have been infected.
Pape said such comparisons are tenuous, because northern Ohio has different
species of mosquitoes that carry West Nile than does Colorado. Still, he
said, "I think there are infection rates of 5 percent in some towns on the
Eastern Plains. And there probably are areas of the northern Front Range
where they have infection rates that are that high."

[The presumptive West Nile virus-positive Coloradan blood donors are not
included in the CDC-ArboNET figures listed in the current MMWR report. This
may indicate that these results have still to be confirmed. Consequently
the estimation of the number of West Nile virus-infected individuals in
Colorado by extrapolation from the blood donor figures has to be regarded
with caution at this stage. - Mod.CP]

New York: 1st West Nile Virus Infection Death of Year on Long Island
----------------------------------------------------------------------
A 62-year-old West Babylon man died yesterday after contracting West Nile
virus infection, and 3 more cases were reported in Suffolk and Nassau
counties. He was the first to die in 2003 on Long Island from the
mosquito-borne disease, out of a total of 6 reported cases.
Suffolk officials also reported yesterday the second case of West Nile
virus infection in the county -- a 46-year-old man from Ronkonkoma. After
picking up the virus in mid-August 2003, he was hospitalized for a week for
meningitis, a result of West Nile virus, and is now recovering at home,
Dillon said.
In Nassau County, officials yesterday reported a 61-year-old Westbury woman
and a 54-year-old Floral Park man as having contracted West Nile virus
infection. The Westbury woman fell ill on 27 Aug 2003, the Floral Park man
on 25 Aug, officials said. Both were hospitalized and recuperating at home.
"This is the time of year that we expect to see additional cases of West
Nile virus infection," said Dr. Abby Greenberg of the Nassau County health
department. She said most cases occur in late August and early September.
"The number of people infected today remains low," she said. Late in August
2003, the state Health Department confirmed 2 other cases of West Nile in
Nassau County. There were 2 West Nile deaths in Suffolk County during 2002.

Arizona: Horse in Douglas Area Has Contracted West Nile Virus Infection
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Another case of an Arizona horse infected with the West Nile virus has been
reported in the Douglas area, a health official said yesterday.
On Tuesday, Pinal County health officials reported the death of a
21-year-old horse in the Casa Grande area due to West Nile virus infection.
The Cochise County Web site said as of 22 Aug 2003, 7 mosquitoes have
tested positive for the virus in the San Simon area just west of the New
Mexico border.
There have been no animal or human cases reported in Pima County, health
officials here said, though it's believed there will be.

[Powell Gammill has provided the following commentary on this press report
and others in the same vein: "Casa Grande is located approximately in
between Arizona's 2 most populous areas, Tucson and the Phoenix
metropolitan area. This makes 4 geographic locations for the West Nile
virus within the state. The first on the central eastern border, the second
on the northeastern corner, the third on the southwestern corner of the
state, and now a location roughly centrally located. This demonstrates how
fast this avian-transferred virus can spread, though I suspect the spread
has occurred from 2 directions: First, a westward spread from New Mexico
and Colorado, and the second from northern bird migration from the Central
Americas, explaining Southern California and Yuma's virus detections. Which
source the Casa Grande located virus is from would be interesting to test,
if there are recognizable markers found to differentiate the 2 hypothesized
viral sources." - Mod.CP]

[As stated in part [1], the only states in the USA with no confirmed cases
of autochthonous West Nile virus infections are Hawaii, Alaska, Nevada, and
Oregon. The number of human cases recorded is continuing to increase; from
1046 in the past week in contrast to 414 in the preceding week. The state
of Colorado has reported the greatest number of cases: 33.3 percent
(973/2923) of the total number of confirmed cases. - Mod.CP]
