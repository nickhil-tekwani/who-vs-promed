[The 18th meeting of the Global Framework for the Progressive Control of Transboundary Animal Diseases (GF-TAD)'s Standing Group of Experts on ASF in Europe (SGE ASF18) took place as a teleconference on 23 Nov 2021. A total of 14 countries of Europe participated, as well as the representatives of GF-TAD from Asia and the Americas.

The SGE ASF18 developed a set of recommendations (see https://rr-europe.oie.int/en/events/sge-asf18-18th-meeting-of-the-standing-group-of-experts-on-african-swine-fever-in-europe/). Amongst these, it was highlighted that:
- Based on science and OIE Standards, Recommendations published by the SGE since 2014 should be considered; helping all countries reach the objectives of this GFTADs ASF initiative.
- Outdoor pig farms may carry a substantial risk of introducing and spreading ASF in areas affected by ASF.
- Biosecurity is key to prevent and control ASF spread and should be enhanced because of specific ASF risks for outdoor farms.
- Pig farmers should set up a system to regularly implement independent and objective on-farm biosecurity assessments using comprehensive standard protocols; competent authorities should then perform controls and register or approve outdoor pig farms based on their biosecurity risk. The aim of such a system should be to further reduce the risk of ASF introduction and spread related to outdoor pig farms.
- Farmers should be encouraged, where this is not already the case, to implement single solid or double fences on all outdoor pig farms, at least in areas where ASF is present in wild boar and in domestic pigs, to reduce the risk of ASF introduction.

According to the meeting report (https://rr-europe.oie.int/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/sge_asf18_report_final.pdf), Russia and Ukraine noted the following:

Russia
- The situation in Russia had been relatively stable, but is now unfortunately developing again.
- Two main regions are affected: the Far East, and the region between Yaroslavl - Vladimir - Nizhnii-Novgorod (northeast of Moscow).
- 24 cases of ASF in wild boar were notified in the Russian far east, mostly half decomposed WB carcasses, during the first half of the year.
- Over the summer, testing continued, with wild boar found dead in Velikii-Novgorod and Pskov regions all negative.
- In zones considered to be previously affected, 495 wild boar found dead were tested, with 21% positive to PCR.
- 167 outbreaks were declared in domestic pigs, with 2 main clusters in the affected regions (mentioned above). Eight outbreaks were identified in previously free regions and were linked to swill feeding.
- 2022 is considered a high-risk year, with human factor as the main risk for spread of the disease in domestic pigs.
- Regionalization is being practiced and helping slow down the spread of the disease.
- The Russian Federation has a programme for control measures between the different regions defined in the regionalization process, while the regions have their own programmes to improve their status.

Ukraine
- Surveillance is ongoing. In previously free areas, one positive wild boar was found dead (out of 8 found). One hunted boar was also tested positive for ASFv.
- Surveillance in domestic pigs found 5 new outbreaks in backyard farms, including 4 in previously free areas.
