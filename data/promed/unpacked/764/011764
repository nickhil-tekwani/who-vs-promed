Avian influenza situation in Egypt: update 38
---------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health of Egypt has announced a new case of human
infection of H5N1 avian influenza. A 30-year-old female from Gharbia
Governorate, developed symptoms on 28 Nov 2010, was hospitalized on 1
Dec 2010, where she received oseltamivir treatment, and died on 2 Dec
2010. Investigations into the source of infection indicated that the
case had exposure to sick and dead poultry.

The case was confirmed by the Egyptian Central Public Health
Laboratories, a National Influenza Center of the WHO Global Influenza
Surveillance Network (GISN).

Of the 113 cases confirmed to date in Egypt, 37 have been fatal.
