Unfortunately the Australian press haven't reported the whole of my
interview on these cases. What we have is 5 cases over 3 years of
encephalitides for which the usual infective causes have been ruled out
(HSV, MVE etc.). It was emphasized that these cases come from a broad
geographical area and are not necessarily connected to each other:
non-infectious causes are also possible. We made mention of the cases in
a conference talk merely because it was unusual for a cluster of
unexplained cases to occur over such a reasonably short time.

[It is debatable whether "5 cases [occurring over 3 years ... from a broad
geographical area ... not necessarily connected to each other" constitute a
cluster. Also, to quote my esteemed colleague, Charlie Calisher, a.k.a
Mod.CHC, "Keep in mind that it ain't a virus until it is shown to be a
virus." We don't even know if they
share the same etiology. If they do, then they could be considered a
cluster. Nevertheless, if the agent is that hard to identify, it is of
special interest. We trust Dr Beaman will keep us informed. - Mod.JW
