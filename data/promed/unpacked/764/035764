Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 - update 108
---------------------------------
Weekly update:
--------------
As of Sun 4 Jul 2010, worldwide more than 214 countries and overseas
territories or communities have reported laboratory confirmed cases
of pandemic influenza H1N1 2009, including over 18 311 deaths.

The WHO is actively monitoring the progress of the pandemic through
frequent consultations with the WHO Regional Offices and Member
States and through monitoring of multiple sources of information.


Situation update:
-----------------
Worldwide, overall pandemic influenza activity remains low. Active
circulation of pandemic influenza virus persists in areas of the
tropics, particularly in South and Southeast Asia, the Caribbean and
West Africa. Overall pandemic and seasonal influenza activity has
remained low during the early part of the current winter season in
the temperate zone of the southern hemisphere. Low levels of seasonal
influenza (H3N2 and type B) viruses were detected during June 2010 in
South Africa, while Chile, Australia, and New Zealand, have all
recently detected low levels of predominantly pandemic influenza
virus. Increasing seasonal influenza activity has also recently been
observed in several countries of Central America.

Although rates of respiratory disease have begun to increase in
several countries of the temperate zone of the southern hemisphere,
little pandemic or seasonal influenza activity has been seen so far
during early part of the winter season. In South Africa, a sharp
increase in the detection rate of influenza virus, primarily seasonal
influenza H3N2 and type B, was observed during the later part of June
and early July (> 40 percent of sentinel respiratory samples from
patients with ILI [influenza-like illness] tested positive for
influenza during the first week of July); however, levels of
respiratory illness- related outpatient consultations and
hospitalizations do not appear to be significantly elevated.

In Australia, slight increases in the rates of ILI have been reported
in recent weeks, however, the overall number of influenza virus
detections (primarily pandemic H1N1 and seasonal H3N2) remain low. In
New Zealand, rates of ILI have steadily increased over the month of
June; however, only small numbers of predominantly pandemic influenza
virus have been detected so far. In both Australia and New Zealand,
current levels of ILI are similar to those observed during the same
period in 2008, when the influenza season was noted to have arrived
and peaked late in winter.

In Chile, overall levels of ILI remain very low; less than 5 percent
of respiratory samples tested positive for influenza in late June
2010 (the majority were pandemic H1N1 virus with small numbers of
seasonal influenza H3N2 and type B detected as well). In Argentina,
overall levels of ILI remained low and below levels observed during
the past 3 winter influenza seasons; only small numbers of seasonal
influenza type B viruses have been detected during recent weeks. In
both Chile and Argentina, RSV [respiratory syncytial virus] has been
the predominant circulating respiratory virus since mid-April 2010.

In Asia, overall pandemic influenza activity remains low to sporadic,
except in parts of India, Malaysia, and Singapore. In India,
transmission of pandemic influenza virus remains active but stable in
the southern state of Kerala; similar numbers of new, severe and
fatal cases have been reported on a weekly basis since transmission
first increased during mid-June 2010. Smaller increases in pandemic
influenza virus circulation have also been observed since mid-June
2010 in other southern and western states of India. In Singapore,
levels of ARI and pandemic influenza virus transmission declined
during June 2010 after peaking in May 2010; the proportion of
patients with ILI testing positive for pandemic influenza virus
remained stable at 16 percent during the 1st week of July 2010.

Of note, substantial co-circulation of pandemic and seasonal
influenza H3N2 viruses was detected in Singapore throughout May and
June 2010. In Malaysia, declining numbers of new cases of pandemic
influenza continued to be reported suggesting that overall pandemic
influenza activity continued to decline substantially in June 2010
after peaking during mid-April to mid-May 2010. Very low level of
seasonal influenza type B viruses continue to circulate across China,
Hong Kong SAR (China), Chinese Taipei and the Republic of Korea.

In the tropical regions of the Americas, overall pandemic and
seasonal influenza activity remained low, except in parts of Central
America, where there has been recent active co-circulation of
pandemic and seasonal H3N2 viruses. In Panama, a sharp increase in
the circulation influenza A viruses (particularly H3N2, but also
small numbers of pandemic H1N1) was reported over the month of June
2010; during the most recent reporting week, a high intensity of
respiratory diseases and a moderate impact on health care services
was reported.

In Nicaragua, recent active transmission of seasonal influenza H3N2
viruses, which began during late May 2010 and peaked during mid June
2010, appears to have largely subsided during recent weeks. In
Colombia, a recent period of active pandemic influenza virus
transmission, spanning mid-May to mid-June 2010, now appears to have
largely subsided. Many countries in the region continue to report
ongoing co-circulation of other respiratory viruses, most notably RSV.

In sub-Saharan Africa, the current situation is largely unchanged
since the last update. Pandemic and seasonal influenza activity
continues to be observed in several countries. Ghana, in West Africa,
continues to have active circulation of pandemic influenza virus
several months after activity peaked during early April 2010.
Seasonal influenza type B viruses continue to circulate in parts of
central and southern Africa, particularly in Cameroon. Small numbers
of seasonal H3N2 viruses continue to be detected across Africa,
particularly in eastern Africa; the most recent detections have been
reported in Kenya and South Africa.

Overall, in the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere (North
America and Europe), pandemic and seasonal influenza viruses have
been detected only sporadically or at very low levels during the past
month.

[In summary, although rates of respiratory disease have begun to
increase in several countries of the temperate zone of the southern
hemisphere, little pandemic or seasonal influenza activity has been
seen so far during the early part of the winter season. Overall
pandemic and seasonal influenza activity has remained low during the
early part of the current winter season in the temperate zone of the
southern hemisphere. Respiratory syncytial virus has been the
predominant circulating respiratory virus in some South American
countries since mid-April 2010. - Mod.CP]
