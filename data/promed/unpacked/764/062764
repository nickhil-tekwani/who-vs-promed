The Department of Agriculture under the Ministry of Natural Resources
and Labour is putting all farmers in the Territory on high alert
following a Moko Disease outbreak in St. Vincent and the Grenadines
and an alert instituted by St. Lucia [see ProMED-mail posts
20070606.1825 and 20071010.3322].

Deputy Chief Agricultural Officer Mrs. Arona Fahie-Forbes said that
the hosts of this disease are bananas, plantains, tomatoes,
eggplants, sweet peppers, hot peppers and potatoes. She also added
that the causal agent is a bacterium (_Ralstonia solanacearum_).

According to agricultural officials, when the disease is exhibited in
young plants, the central leaves break at a sharp angle while still
green, they wilt, and subsequent plant death is rapid, within a week
or less. In older plants, the inner leaf 1st turns yellow near the
petiole. The petiole breaks down, and the leaf wilts and dies.
Eventually, all leaves bend down and dry out. Mrs. Forbes said
additional symptoms are that the vascular bundles in the pseudostem
appear yellowish brown to black when cut. She also added that the
infection from this disease is systemic and that fruit growth is also
stopped once this infection occurs. Bananas near maturity may show no
outward symptoms, but the inner pulp may be discoloured and decayed.

The disease can be spread by insects, water, weeds, infested soil,
contaminated planting material, contaminated farm tools and
equipment, plant-to-plant contact, animals and on shoes. The
Department is therefore reminding persons that total eradication of
all infected and surrounding plants is the only way to prevent such
an outbreak. The Department recently held a meeting for banana
farmers to alert them about an outbreak and to inform them about the
symptoms, threats and effects of this destructive disease.

In an effort to delay the introduction of this destructive disease,
the Department of Agriculture is asking all persons to refrain from
bringing any banana suckers into the Territory from St. Vincent and
the Grenadines, Jamaica, Trinidad or Guyana.

[Moko disease was 1st reported in Trinidad in the late 1890s, leading
to severe losses of Moko cooking bananas. It is caused by the
bacterium _Ralstonia solanacearum_ invading the vascular tissues of
the host. Affected species include banana, plantain, heliconia, red
ginger, taro, castor bean, and some weeds. The disease affects all
plant parts with symptoms of wilting, fruit rot, blackening of
suckers, and bacterial ooze leading to a quick death of the plant.
Moko is endemic in South America and is also present in the
Philippines.

_R. solanacearum_ is a species complex with 3 "races" (pathovars).
Race 2 affects banana and plantain. Moko, Bugtok, and blood diseases
of banana are caused by different strains of race 2. The bacterium is
spread by water, wind, infected plant material or soil, and
mechanical means including animals and insects. Ornamentals and weed
species may serve as pathogen reservoirs. Infection can occur via
roots or flowers depending on the host cultivar and pathogen strain.

Moko is one of the most serious banana diseases, with reported yield
losses of over 70 percent. No resistant banana cultivars are known.
The primary means of control is exclusion from areas that are
disease-free and eradication of infected plants where the pathogen is
present. It has severe commercial implications of yield losses and
high costs of control measures needed.
