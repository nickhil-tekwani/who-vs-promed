["Lumpy skin disease (LSD, knopvelsiekte) is a poxvirus disease of cattle characterised by fever, nodules on the skin, mucous membranes, and internal organs, emaciation, enlarged lymph nodes, oedema of the skin, and sometimes death. The disease is of economic importance as it can cause a temporary reduction in milk production, temporary or permanent sterility in bulls, damage to hides, and death due to secondary bacterial infections. Various strains of capripoxvirus are responsible for the disease. These are antigenically indistinguishable from strains causing sheep pox and goat pox yet distinct at the genetic level. LSD has a partially different geographical distribution from sheep and goat pox, suggesting that cattle strains of capripoxvirus do not infect and transmit between sheep and goats. Transmission of LSD virus (LSDV) is thought to be predominantly by arthropods, natural contact transmission in the absence of vectors being inefficient. Lumpy skin disease is endemic in most African and Middle Eastern countries. In 2015 and 2016 the disease spread to south-east Europe, the Balkans and the Caucasus.

"LSDV is not transmissible to humans. However, all laboratory manipulations must be performed at an appropriate containment level determined by biorisk analysis."
