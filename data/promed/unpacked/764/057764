At first it was just a suspicion, today [2 Jul 2022] the bitter truth: African swine fever [ASF] has reached Lower Saxony. The Friedrich-Löffler-Institut (FLI) confirmed this today, Lower Saxony's Agriculture Minister Barbara Otte-Kinast announced today at a press conference in Hanover.

A sow farm in the municipality of Emsbüren in southern Emsland with 280 sows and 1500 piglet rearing places is affected. After the farmer found clinical signs -- fever, lack of appetite -- in his sows and consulted his farm veterinarian, samples were sent to the Lower Saxony State Office for Consumer Protection and Food Safety (LAVES) for examination.

The culling of the affected population will take place tomorrow [3 Jul 2022]. It is currently being examined whether another contact farm in the Freren area needs to be culled. The farm had received piglets from the sow farmer in the past few days.

The cause of the entry is currently unclear. "So far there has been no lead," emphasized the minister. The establishment of a 10-km (6.2 mi) surveillance zone that extends into the neighboring district of Bentheim is currently being prepared. The surveillance zone will also extend to the state border of North Rhine-Westphalia.

There are 296 farms with 195 000 pigs in the exclusion zone. These are now being clinically examined with the support of LAVES employees. Blood samples are taken from suspected animals and examined for antibodies. The movement of pigs, pig products and manure into the
surveillance zone is prohibited until further notice. The grain harvest that is currently starting is still allowed, as it is not an outbreak in wild boar.

The general decrees, which among other things define the exact boundaries of the restricted areas, are in preparation. They are due to be published on Monday [4 Jul 2022] and will come into effect on Tuesday [5 Jul 2022].

Minister Otte-Kinast and the department head responsible for animal health, Prof. Dr. Michael Kühne, appealed to all pig farmers from the restricted areas not to panic. "Now do not move pigs from your farms. We have to prevent that a single outbreak becomes a mass infection event," says Otte-Kinast. The veterinary authorities, LAVES and the slaughter industry will do everything to ensure that fattening pigs or
piglets can be removed from the surveillance or restriction areas in an "orderly" manner in order to avoid animal welfare problems.

According to Prof. Kühne, there is also a new ASF outbreak on a fattening farm in southern Brandenburg. "We have to assume that ASF will continue to spread in Germany. It is all the more important that farmers, butchers, marketers and authorities keep calm and take coordinated action to combat the disease," emphasized Kühne.

[The Emsland district borders on its west the Dutch provinces Groningen and Drenthe (map at http://tinyurl.com/mr2kdmas). This spread of ASF is alarming news for the Dutch pig industry.

ASF has been spreading in Germany's eastern states, Brandenburg and Saxony, since September 2020, introduced by wild boars from Poland. In Germany it has since mainly affected wild boar, with sporadic spillovers into pig farms, such as the new one in southern Brandenburg. Since September 2020, the virus has spread to Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania (20211115.8699683), Saxony (20211014.8699032) and, most recently, to a single farm in Baden-Wurttemberg (southwest Germany, bordering France), the origin of which has yet to be clarified (20220527.8703487).

Details of all cases confirmed in Germany since the start of the epizootic, in wild boar and domestic pigs, are presented in a continuously updated table on the website of Germany's national laboratory, FLI, including locations and, if available, age and gender of the positive wild boars.
