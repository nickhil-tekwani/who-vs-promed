2021 Texas Anthrax Situational Update
-------------------------------------
Since 24 Aug 2021, the Texas Animal Health Commission (TAHC) has received new confirmations of anthrax in a white-tailed deer on a Kinney County premise on 30 Aug 2021, a white-tailed deer on a Maverick County premise on 2 Sep 2021, and a kudu on a Real County premise on 9 Sep 2021. All premises have been placed under quarantine and will not be released until TAHC requirements are met.

The first anthrax case of the year [2021] was confirmed in a Val Verde County captive white-tailed deer on 11 Jul 2021. Since that time, anthrax was confirmed in a Hardeman County cow on 6 Aug 2021, 2 additional premises in Hardeman County on 19 Aug 2021, an Armstrong County horse on 23 Aug 2021, and an additional Armstrong County premise on 25 Aug 2021.

Texas Anthrax Confirmations
---------------------------
County / Number of premises confirmed
Armstrong / 2
Hardeman / 3
Kinney / 1
Maverick / 1
Real / 1
Val Verde / 1
TOTAL / 9

All of these premises were placed under quarantine and producers were advised on vaccinating exposed animals and the proper disposal of affected carcasses. These premises were not released until TAHC requirements were met.

"TAHC personnel are closely monitoring the anthrax cases in Texas," said Dr. Andy Schwartz, TAHC State Veterinarian and Executive Director. "Anthrax is often seen in the area of the state where our most recent confirmations have been found. We ask producers to remain vigilant and consult with their local veterinary practitioner if they suspect their animals are exposed to anthrax or are interested in vaccinating their livestock."

There is an effective anthrax vaccine available for use in susceptible livestock (includes but is not limited to, swine, equine, sheep, goats, cattle, etc.). The TAHC encourages owners of livestock in the triangular area, bound by the towns of Uvalde, Ozona and Eagle Pass, as well as other counties afflicted this year, including Armstrong, Hardeman and Real, to consult with a local veterinary practitioner and vaccinate livestock. Producers may order anthrax vaccines directly from the manufacturer.

It is common to see an increase in anthrax cases after periods of wet, cool weather, followed by hot, dry conditions. During these conditions, animals ingest the anthrax bacteria when they consume contaminated grass and hay, or inhale the spores. Outbreaks usually end when cooler weather arrives.

After exposure to anthrax, it usually takes 3 to 7 days for animals to show symptoms of anthrax. Once symptoms begin, death will usually occur within 48 hours. Acute fever followed by rapid death with bleeding from body openings are all common signs of anthrax in livestock. Owners of livestock and animals displaying symptoms consistent with anthrax or experiencing death of animals should contact a private veterinary practitioner or a TAHC official immediately.

Producers are encouraged to follow basic sanitation precautions when handling affected livestock or carcasses. It is recommended to wear protective gloves, long sleeve shirts and to wash thoroughly afterward to prevent accidental spread of the bacteria to people.

[There is an excellent map embedded in this report and it can be readily enlarged to be able to read the county names. Armstrong and Hardeman are in northern Texas. Val Verde, Real, Kinney, and Maverick are a south-western cluster in the part of Texas regularly afflicted with anthrax, especially the wildlife species. In this area tabanid biting flies play a significant part in the nature of the outbreaks. We have yet to get a good idea of how they are initiated in white-tailed deer which are very sensitive to minimal infective spore doses. Because of the part played by tabanid flies it is wise to vaccinate any cattle near deer outbreaks.

This is turning into a normal anthrax season in Texas. The kudu would have been on a high fenced ranch with exotics for rich clients to shoot in the deer season.

Texas has seen its share of human cutaneous cases from the careless handling and even skinning of infected carcasses. This area in south west Texas is largely deer ranches of various sizes. When doing research in this region we strongly advise that the anthrax deer carcasses be burnt. The most cost-effective method is to buy the necessary number of sacks of charcoal briquettes with a small bag for the head. Put the carcass on the bags and use diesel oil to ignite the fuel. It usually takes about an hour plus and one can then put a second carcass on top of the burnt first. This incineration method is a lot easier and quicker than collecting up dry branches. - Mod.MHJ
