Deadly child killer moving to the highlands
-------------------------------------------
Burkitts lymphoma, a child killer cancer mainly afflicting Nyanza and
other low lying areas of western Kenya, is now spreading to the Rift
Valley and other adjacent highland areas.
The disease, whose treatment cost is in excess of $3,950
(Sh300,000) in private hospitals is a leading child killer, with
Nyanza and Western provinces contributing 57 per cent of all the
cases.
But now the disease is spreading according to Dr O. W. Mwanda,
in-charge at Kenyatta National Hospital's paediatric ward.
"Only recently have we started receiving cases from other
communities like the Kalenjin and Maragoli indicating that the
cancer is now spreading to the highlands."
Dr Mwanda says: "It's fairly common in tropical countries with high
rainfall, high temperatures, low lying areas which are malaria areas.
But the relationship between malaria and Burkitts Lymphoma so far
is purely geographical. 'No area, no tribe, no region, no climate is
exempt from Burkitt's lymphoma."
For almost five decades, since this devastating cancer was
discovered by Dr Dennis Burkitt, Burkitt's lymphoma, a lymph gland
tumour, has become a nightmare for African and American
children. In Africa the disease is prevalent in malaria-prone areas.
David Violante, an Emergency medical service paramedic from
New York says Burkitts lymphoma is "an abnormal cell growth
which, if left untreated, leads to cancer. Finally it kills because the
patient cannot breath well with most of the throat blocked. It is
treated by Cytoxin, a very expensive anti-cancer drug."
The disease first manifests itself as a swelling of the lymph nodes
in the neck or below the jaw. It is often painless during the initial
stages but unlike post-infection nodes, these lymph nodes grow
very rapidly.
Dr Mwanda says: "The Burkitt's lymphoma tumour grows at a faster
rate than the human foetus. It has a half-life [sic] of 26 hours. This
means that every 26 hours, the tumour increases by half its size."
Professor William M. Macharia, of the University of Nairobi's
department of paediatrics & child health, concurs with Dr Mwanda.
"It is the fastest growing tumour known in history. It is the most
common cancer affecting children in Kenya."
The East African Medical Journal of October 1996 states that
Burkitt's lymphoma accounts for 38.4 per cent of all childhood
malignancies [in East Africa].
There are two types of Burkitt's lymphoma. African type, which is
endemic and the American type which is non-endemic. The
difference between the two, Prof Macharia says, is that the
American type affects the [lymph] nodes while the African type
affects the bones.
Prof Macharia says: "It first presents itself as a swelling on the
bones of the face mainly in the upper jaw. Even though we have
about 30 to 40 per cent of Burkitt's lymphoma, the first presentation
is in the abdomen in the glands of the gut. The second type is
similar to the American form of Burkitt's lymphoma. Sometime back
we also received reports of the American type Burkitt's lymphoma
in the Ruwenzori Mountains in Tanzania."

[This moderator worked with Dennis Burkitt in Uganda at the time
Dennis recognized BL as a distinct entity, & with Tony Epstein at
the time the latter discovered it was caused by the virus that bears
his name, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV, also known as human
herpesvirus 4, HHV4). I also studied the relationship of BL to
malaria in Uganda with Julian de Zulueta of WHO. We concluded
that it was coincidental, & due to some unknown geographical co-
factor common to both malaria & BL.
Among the many strange things about this tumor is that it is 100%
curable by chemotherapy (methotrexate) -- the tumour goes down
like a pricked balloon -- and that EBV has a worldwide distribution
(it's the cause of infectious mononucleosis) yet only causes
cancer in the malarious areas of Africa & Papua New Guinea,
apart from the rare cases elswhere (called the American type).
EBV is also associated with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC),
which is also global in distribution but most prevalent in China.
Since malaria has been spreading to the highlands of Kenya &
PNG, perhaps somebody should be looking for BL in the New
Guinea highlands also? - Mod.JW]
