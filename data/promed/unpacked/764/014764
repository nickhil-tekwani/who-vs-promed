Re: 20051118.3355 [1]: Viet Nam, cormorants - request for information
---------------------------------------------------------------------
I conducted water bird surveys on behalf of Wetlands International in
the Vietnamese part of the Mekong Delta in March/April and November
2000 in collaboration with Can Tho University, visiting all of the
Mekong's river-mouths and hinterland wetlands. My time in Dong Thap
province was limited but included some survey work in Tram Chim, the
most important water bird site in that province.
The Little (or "Black") Cormorant _Phalacrocorax niger_ is easily the
most numerous cormorant species that I encountered in Dong Thap
Province or other sites in the Vietnamese Mekong. I failed to observe
any Great Cormorants _Phalacrocorax carbo_ at any of the 10 or more
sites I surveyed throughout the region (Great Cormorant being a
species I have even more experience with, with 2000 to 3000 wintering
regularly at a local estuary here, The Nakdong in South Korea, none
with any evidence of disease up to now).
In addition, Birdlife International Viet Nam Program in collaboration
with the Institute of Ecology and Biological Resources produced in
1999 "Conservation Report Number 12," entitled "The Conservation of
Key Wetland Sites in The Mekong Delta" [Ref 1]. In it, they include
data from their surveys of 11 key wetland areas, including Tram Chim
National Park, and do not include any Great Cormorant in their tables
(though their surveys did find Little and Indian Cormorants _P.
fusicollis_, both at Tram Chim and also at other sites in the Mekong).
A further reference is the field guide to the Birds of Viet Nam
(Nguyen cu, Le Trong Trai and Karen Phillipps, 2000) which -- while
written in Vietnamese -- also has status comments in English. [Ref 2].
The 3 Cormorant species in Viet Nam are coded on p. 209 thus:
1) Great Cormorant _P. carbo_: Rare migrant, northern & central Viet
Nam; uncommon resident in Mekong provinces.
2) Indian Cormorant _P. fusicollis_: Resident common, Mekong Provinces
3) Little Cormorant _P. niger_: Rare resident in northern 5/6 of the country;
uncommon resident in Mekong Provinces.
Although none of any of the above actually proves the identity of the
cormorants [suspected to be infected], it does suggest very strongly
that the 30 cormorants will not be part of any migratory population
of Great Cormorant from China (or elsewhere).
In addition: throughout the Mekong wetlands that I visited, it was
extremely typical to see large flocks of domestic ducks sharing --
along with pigs, chickens, and people -- huts along the banks of
waterways, especially near Tram Chim National Park and other
protected areas. The reason for this concentration near remaining
natural wetlands is that local people regularly exploit the wild
vegetation, fish and birds within such areas to supplement an often
extremely poor local economy.
This potential for local infection of wild birds by infected poultry appears
to be increased even further, as I understand it, by the use of livestock
excrement in fish-ponds in the same region of Viet Nam, as discussed by T.
Watanabe of the Environment and Crop Production Division of JIRCAS at

[2] UK, imported Mesias

From: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>

[Further to 20051115.3343, which included the official information on the
detection of H5N1 infection in imported captive wild birds in a quarantine
station in Essex, UK, we have been forwarded the following BBC news item,
which might be of significance.]

Responding to the [Defra's epidemiological] report, the Taiwanese
government said: "There is a good possibility that profit-driven
traders smuggled mesias from China to Taiwan, using our avian
flu-free country as a front from which they laundered these birds to
the UK and other countries."

[The following interesting commentary, related to the above
information, has been forwarded to us from a reliable source in Japan:
"[The above scenario] sounds like a very promising possibility.
Practically the same thing happened in 1998 (though I am not aware if
there is an English language report on this). A consignment of
songbirds from Hong Kong (which was then H5N1 affected) was sent,
illegally, to Japan via Malaysia, using Malaysia as a false area of
origin for the birds. Legal action was immediately taken by the
Japanese government. At that time, Japan imported a large number of
wild birds labeled as "originating from Malaysia," [a country] which
was AI virus free and so a legal area of origin.
The URL of the engaged NGO (The National Wild Bird Poaching
Countermeasure of Japan):
<http://tatsutomi.co.jp/mittairen/> (Japanese only).
The above story is described in detail in the following book:
<http://www.amazon.co.jp/exec/obidos/ASIN/4062721635/250-2392309-4205055>
(Japanese, author: Kimio Endo)."
We are grateful for the above observation. It underlines the
complexity and the risks involved in the international trade in
captive and pet birds, a problem familiar to anyone engaged in
veterinary inspection thereon. Reliable, clear identification of
each consignment, preferably of each bird, is an elementary
requirement for effective animal health control upon this (huge)
trade. - Mod.AS]

[Recent posts dealt with the reported detection of an H5N1-positive flamingo
in Kuwait. The information was rather ambiguous and led to several responses
discussing issues such as the species involved and the bird's origin
(migratory or local). The following official notification to the OIE,
including an update of 17 Nov 2005, might shed some light on the case.

Avian Influenza In Kuwait (Detection of H5N1 antibodies in a flamingo)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Information received on 10 Nov 2005 from Dr. Mohammed Wael
Al-Muhanna, Acting Deputy Director General for Animal Health, The
Public Authority for Agriculture Affairs and Fish Resources (PAAF),
Safat:
Report date: 10 Nov 2005.
Precise identification of agent: avian influenza virus subtype H5N1.
Date of 1st confirmation of the event: 9 Nov 2005.
During routine surveillance for avian influenza, one out of 2
flamingos in a private property close to the beach was found to be
positive for antibodies against avian influenza virus subtype H5N1.
Laboratory where diagnostic tests were performed: Virology
Laboratory, Department of Animal Health.
Date of submission of the samples: 2 Nov 2005.
Diagnostic tests used:
1. Hemagglutination inhibition test using standard known
hemagglutinating H5N1 antigen (from CVL Weybridge, United Kingdom).
Date of results: 9 Nov 2005.
Results: One out of 2 samples was positive for H5N1 antibodies.
2. Standard antigen detection test for fecal samples from both flamingos.
Date of results: 9 Nov 2005.
Results: negative.
Source of outbreak or origin of infection: may be due to migratory
birds' droppings.
Control measures: both birds were killed and incinerated immediately
(stamping out), and the entire farm and the area were disinfected.
Other details/comments: serum and fecal samples collected from the
neighboring enclosures and the neighboring farms were found to be
negative for both antibodies and antigen detection.
Additional information received on 17 Nov 2005 from Dr. Mohammed Wael
Al-Muhanna, Acting Deputy Director General for Animal Health, The
Public Authority for Agriculture Affairs and Fish Resources (PAAF),
Safat:
Report date: 17 Nov 2005.
For routine surveillance for avian influenza (AI) in the bird
population in Kuwait, the laboratory has used the following samples
and procedures:
Samples:
- Serum samples from live birds.
- Cloacal swabs/feces from live or dead birds.
Procedures:
- Serological test: hemagglutination inhibition test standard AI
antigen (from CVL Weybridge, United Kingdom).
- Antigen detection: commercialized validated rapid AI virus antigen
test kit; immunochromatographic test for the qualitative detection of
AI virus antigen (all types) in avian feces; rapid H5 AI virus
antigen test kit; immunochromatographic test for the qualitative
detection of H5 AI virus antigen in avian feces.
Culture attempted on embryonated specific pathogen free chicken eggs
did not yield any AI isolates, hence no pathogenicity index test
could be performed. It should also be noted that the serological
tests (hemagglutination inhibition test), rapid antigen detection
tests and isolation procedures in embryonated chicken SPF eggs have
not revealed any positive results in any of the different kinds of
birds tested from various areas in Kuwait since the last report.

[The main points which can be deduced from the 2 reports are:
1. The tests were performed on live flamingoes, "in a private property close
to the beach," thus, most probably local and not migratory;
2. Sera and cloacal swabs were tested;
3. The said samples were obtained during "routine surveillance;"
4. One serum sample was found in which the bird reacted positively to the HI
test using standard AI antigen from CVL Weybridge, United Kingdom [the
reference lab. - Mod.JW].
5. No antigen could be detected.
Serosurveillance in live -- free or captive -- wild birds is a
commendable but rather unusual measure. Data on the background and
framework of the Kuwaiti surveillance scheme will be appreciated.
The current Kuwaiti case is regarded as "suspected" until further
details and confirmation from a reference laboratory are available. -
