Tasmania's Department of Primary Industries and Water (DPIW) has
confirmed the presence of _Wheat streak mosaic virus_ [WSMV] in the
Apple Isle [Tasmania] for the 1st time. It follows survey, sampling,
and testing work by the DPIW.
According to DPIW biosecurity and product integrity division general
manager, Alex Schaap, the department also surveyed for the existence
of the primary vector of the virus, the wheat curl mite, and found it
is widely distributed throughout Tasmania. "The presence of both
virus and vector indicate likely broad distribution of the virus in
the State," Mr Schaap said.
"It is difficult to predict the impact of the virus on Tasmania's
cereal crops. But, given the widespread nature of the virus, its
previous presence in the State, and no obvious manifestation of
disease to this date, the impacts may be low in Tasmania. Only time will tell."
The Tasmanian cereal and grains industry was last week [17-23 Sep
2007] advised of the confirmation of WSMV presence and DPIW will
provide additional management advice to growers as needed. As the
virus is present throughout [mainland] Australia, there are no trade
ramifications with this confirmation.

[_Wheat streak mosaic virus_ (WSMV; genus _Tritimovirus_, family
_Potyviridae_) is prevalent in North America, Russia, Eastern Europe,
and has recently been reported from Australia (2003) and Argentina.
It is spread by the wheat curl mite _Aceria tulipae_. Larvae acquire
the virus by feeding on infected plants and remain infectious for
approximately a week. The virus is not transmitted congenitally to
the progeny of the vector. WSMV can also be mechanically transmitted
and seed transmitted at a very low level. It infects wheat, maize
(some cultivars), grasses, and also oats and barley in experimental
inoculations. Heavy infection of WSMV can cause complete crop failure
in wheat. Control of the mite vector is difficult but disease
management may include controlling volunteer wheat and grassy weeds
to minimise inoculum.
