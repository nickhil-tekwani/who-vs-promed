[Dr Lernout has drawn attention to an error in the report on the
measles situation in the island of Mayotte, posted as part [1] of the
ProMED-mail Measles update 2011 (28) 20110821.2546]

In response to the measles update posted 21 Aug 2011, I would like to
correct the information on measles in Mayotte. The alert is indeed a
translation of a communication published in a local journal, except
for 3 words that have been omitted: "in Reunion Island". 3
autochthonous cases (without travel history to metropolitan France)
have been identified last week in Reunion Island. So far, no measles
cases were confirmed in Mayotte, but health professionals have been
alerted on the possible introduction of the virus on the island."

The Health Service Executive (HSE) has strongly advised parents to
ensure their children have 2 doses of MMR [mumps, measles, and
rubella] vaccine, as cases of measles begin to rise in Ireland and
across Europe. The MMR vaccine is the only protection available from
measles, which can be a very serious and sometimes fatal illness.

"We have seen a rapid increase in numbers of measles cases recently,
most of them centred in north Dublin city," said Dr Margaret
Fitzgerald, HSE director of public health. In the year 2000, a serious
outbreak in Dublin saw cases rise as high as 1600, and claimed the
lives of 3 young children."

Measles is a highly infectious and dangerous illness which spreads
very easily, particularly in homes, creches [day care centres],
playgroups, camps, schools, and universities. There have been 135
cases of measles in Ireland since the start of 2011. Of the more than
26 000 cases across Europe, some have resulted in some severe
outcomes, with 6 deaths, 14 neurological complications, and 444 cases
of severe pneumonia.

In Ireland, the 1st MMR dose is given at 12 months of age, and the 2nd
dose at 4 to 5 years of ages. At the moment, only 90 per cent of
children in Ireland have received one dose of MMR by 24 months of age,
which is below the target of 95 per cent to prevent cases of measles
and measles outbreaks.

Measles cases in Europe: update to end-July 2011
------------------------------------------------
In June [2011], as part of an initiative to step up measles
surveillance in Europe the European Centre for Disease Prevention and
Prevention (ECDC) launched a monthly report, European monthly measles
monitoring (EMMO) which includes timely updates on measles outbreaks
and endemic transmission in Europe based on active surveillance
reported from EU and EEA/EFTA countries [1].

In the 2nd EMMO report for July 2011 an additional 5000 new cases were
confirmed across 30 reporting countries across Europe, bringing the
total cases for the 1st 7 months of 2011 to more than 26 000 [2].
France (14 040), Italy (4000), Spain (2407), Romania (2072), and
Germany (1361) have reported the highest cumulative number of measles
in 2011. The report warns that World Youth Day and other
mass-gathering events in Europe during the summer months increase the
risk of spreading measles in Europe and exportation of measles to
other parts of the world. Those planning holidays or travelling to
mass-gathering events in Europe during the summer should ensure they
are protected against measles.

Confirmed measles cases in England and Wales
--------------------------------------------
In England and Wales, 777 laboratory confirmed measles cases have been
reported so far in 2011 to the end of July. 100 cases had onset in
July compared with 133 in June and 176 in May, although the number for
June is known to be an underestimate as around 80 unvaccinated
children with clinical measles associated with an outbreak in an
anthroposophical school declined to be tested for measles infection.
Outbreaks in schools and small family clusters are continuing to be
reported in London (310 cases), while most of the recent cases in
South East (207 cases) and South West (67 cases) are associated with
schools attended by children of families known to oppose vaccination,
with limited onward transmission to the wider community. Measles has
been identified in a traveller community in London. This is likely to
result in a spread in the wider traveller communities in coming
months. As anticipated, there have also been a small number of cases
linked to music festivals during the last 2 months [2,3]. Cases
continue to be reported in unvaccinated individuals with more than 50
per cent of cases in children and adolescents aged 5 to 19 years.

An outbreak of measles raging in recent days the municipality of Cuito
Cuanavale, Cuando Cubango province, is causing the local authority
great concern. According to an ANGOP [news agency] report of Tue 23
Aug 2011 the outbreak has been responsible for the deaths of 4
children.

According to Joaquim Kantema, the city manager, after the onset of the
measles outbreak the local authorities implemented a routine
vaccination campaign. The campaign will be extended to cover 3
communities -- Lupiri, Longa, and Baixo-Longa -- with a view to
stalling the spread of the disease.

In the last few days, 3 deaths have been reported in the Dumba
neighbourhood and 16 cases in the Longa commune resulted in the deaths
of 5 children.

In July 2011 alone, 1019 suspected measles cases and 31 related deaths
have been reported in South and Central Somalia, representing almost
20 per cent of all cases for this year. Compared with the same period
in 2010, the number of suspected measles cases has increased by 666
per cent 4 [sic]. Since January 2011, 5176 suspected measles cases
were reported in South and Central Somalia alone.

Measles is a highly contagious viral disease, which affects mostly
children. It is transmitted via droplets from the nose, mouth, or
throat of infected persons. Initial symptoms, which usually appear
10-12 days after infection, include high fever, runny nose, bloodshot
eyes, and tiny white spots on the inside of the mouth. Several days
later, a rash develops, starting on the face and upper neck and
gradually spreading downwards.

There is no specific treatment for measles and most people recover
within 2-3 weeks. However, particularly in malnourished children and
people with reduced immunity, measles can cause serious complications,
including blindness, encephalitis, severe diarrhoea, ear infection,
and pneumonia.

The major factors for a measles outbreak in Somalia are low [vaccine]
coverage, malnutrition, population movements, and overcrowded
internally displaced (IDP) camps. WHO fears that the measles outbreak
could lead to serious illness and a high number of deaths, especially
among the vulnerable IDPs whose overall health is already fragile.

Measles can be prevented by vaccination. The routine immunization
against measles in Somalia is 29 per cent. As response to the
suspected measles outbreak, WHO, UNICEF, health partners, and health
authorities kicked off an emergency measles vaccination campaign in
all accessible areas of South and Central Somalia. About 2.3 million
children aged between 6 and 15 years in 10 regions of South and
Central Somalia, including 745 000 children in Mogadishu, will be
targeted during this campaign.

The 1st measles outbreak in 5 years on Zanzibar's main island has
prompted health officials to mount a 2-day emergency immunization of
10 000 children under 5.

Most of the 76 cases recorded occurred over the past 2 weeks, said
health minister Malik Abdallah Juma. "We have had no deaths so far,
and we managed to treat 62 children; the remaining 14 are still in
hospital under close [observation] by doctors," he said.

Abdulhamid Ameir Salum, the manager of Zanzibar's Expanded Programme
on Immunization, said the outbreak was partly due to delays in vaccine
delivery caused by high global demand as well as to parents'
reluctance to bring their children to health centres for
immunization.

A confirmed case of measles in the Edmonton area has prompted Alberta
Health Services to issue a public alert. The health-care provider
wants to follow up with anyone who may have been in close contact with
the ill person, who recently had travelled outside Canada.

Passengers on Air Canada Flight AC244 on 15 Aug 2011 between Vancouver
and Edmonton are asked to call HealthLink Alberta as soon as possible.
The request extends also to anyone who was in the baggage claim area
at Edmonton International Airport between 7 pm and 9:30 pm that day.

Measles is an extremely contagious respiratory disease caused by a
virus and causes fever, runny nose, cough, and a full-body rash.
Individuals who have not already had measles or who haven't been
immunized are at the highest risk.

[Dr A Uma Chandran, MD, FRCPC,
(<uma.chandran@albertahealthservices.ca>), medical officer of health -
Edmonton Zone has supplied further details of the incident as of 25
Aug 2011:

Alberta Health Services has laboratory-confirmed a case of measles in
the Edmonton-area and is following up with individuals who may have
been in close contact with the ill person. The male, who is between 12
and 29 years old, acquired measles while on a family trip in Thailand.
He has no documented measles immunization and is currently recovering
at home.

Onset of rash was 15 Aug 2011. Therefore, the individual is presumed
to have been infectious until 19 Aug 2011. He presented to a local
emergency department (ED) on 16 Aug 2011 for assessment. Astute ER
staff recognized the symptoms and quickly placed the individual in a
negative pressure room on airborne precautions as soon as was
possible.

Local Public Health is currently investigating contacts from the ED
and from the final flight, which landed in Edmonton, in addition to
household contacts. The affected flights are
- Korean Air flight KE668 Chang Mai to Seoul (arrived approx 0630h 15
Aug 2011; 13h layover)
- Korean Air flight KE071 Seoul to Vancouver (arrived approx 1400h 15
Aug 2011; 2h layover)
- Air Canada flight AC224 Vancouver to Edmonton (arrived approx 1850h
15 Aug 2011)

Measles was last identified in the Edmonton-area in August 2010, at
which time one case was identified. Prior to that, the last case was
identified in 2002 (3 cases).

The MMR vaccine, which includes protection against measles, mumps, and
rubella, is part of the routine Childhood Immunization Program in
Alberta. Children in Alberta typically receive their 1st dose of MMR
Vaccine at 12 months of age and their 2nd dose between the ages of 4
and 6 years. Both doses are required to be fully protected.

As of 25 Aug 2011, there have been no secondary cases related to this
case.

Air travellers in Vancouver and Edmonton who were on the same flights
as a passenger with measles should quickly see a physician if they
begin to show symptoms of the highly contagious disease.

Symptoms, which can take from eight to 18 days to develop, include a
cough, runny nose, fever and rash, and can lead to respiratory
complications and diarrhea in vulnerable people, according to Dr
Monika Naus, the medical director of immunization programs for the
British Columbia Centre for Disease Control (BCCDC). There's no
treatment for the disease itself, but individual symptoms are
treatable.

On 15 Aug 2011 the infected traveller passed through Vancouver
International Airport on the way to Edmonton, Naus said on Wednesday.
The passenger came to YVR [Vancouver International Airport] from
Thailand, after transferring planes in South Korea. According to the
BCCDC, the traveller flew on Korean Airlines flight KE071, which left
Seoul, South Korea, about 6:30 pm on 15 Aug 2011. The flight arrived
in Vancouver the same day about 2 pm After spending a couple of hours
in YVR, the passenger boarded Air Canada flight AC244 about 4:30 pm
and flew to Edmonton where the measles diagnosis was made. "Measles is
highly infectious. It can affect any part of the body," Naus said,
explaining that it can easily spread through the air -- especially in
a contained space like an aircraft cabin. She said about 7 per cent of
British Columbians are not vaccinated, which is 5 per cent more than
the national average. "We have more conscientious objectors in this
province," Naus said, when asked about the gap.

Specific flight information pertaining to the infected traveller is
available on the BC Centre for Disease Control website at
http://www.bccdc.ca.

Measles in 2 children, 1 adult confirmed
----------------------------------------
State health officials have confirmed 3 Dakota County measles cases
this month -- possibly started by a toddler who was infected in Kenya.
The 12 month old child was unvaccinated when infected overseas. The
confirmed 2nd case involved a 15 month old who was exposed to the 12
month old and also was unvaccinated, according to the Minnesota
Department of Health.

The 3rd case involved a 43 year old woman who also was exposed to the
12 month old. It was unclear whether she was vaccinated.

Health officials said these cases are unrelated to another recent
measles outbreak in Hennepin County.

The Pennsylvania Department of Health and the Philadelphia Department
of Public Health are advising the public of exposure to a case of
measles in Lancaster and Philadelphia counties. An international
traveler visiting Pennsylvania has been diagnosed as having measles.
He may have exposed other people to the disease while contagious at
the following dates, times and locations:

The individual departed on the Amtrak Keystone Line Train #643 to
Lancaster, Pennsylvania.
- 17 Aug 2011, 1:30 -- 5 pm, 30th St Station, 2955 Market St
The individual departed on the Amtrak Northeast Regional Train no. 171
to Manassas, Virginia

Lancaster County
- 16 Aug 2011, 12:06 - 3:30 pm, Lancaster Amtrak stop, 53 McGovern
Ave, Lancaster, Pennsylvania. The individual arrived via the Amtrak
Keystone Line train no. 643 from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. This
train also continued from Lancaster and arrived in Harrisburg,
Pennsylvania at 12:40 pm; persons riding between Lancaster and
Harrisburg might also have been exposed to measles virus remaining in
the air inside the train.
- 16 Aug 2011, 2:30 -- 7 pm at the following locations: Amish
Experience at Plain and Fancy Farm, 3121 Old Philadelphia Pike,
Bird-in-Hand, Pennsylvania. Glick's Roadside Stand, 248A Monterey
Road, Bird-in-Hand, Pennsylvania. Riehl's Farm/Quilt Shop, 247 E Eby
Road, Leola, Pennsylvania.
The individual reported riding in a taxi (company unknown) from
Lancaster arriving in Philadelphia before 6 pm

Based on the dates of exposure in Pennsylvania, it is possible that
symptoms could develop as late as 7 Sep 2011 if individuals were
infected during the timeframes mentioned above.

An individual with measles can spread the virus to others for 4 days
before and 4 days after the rash begins. It is spread during sneezing
or coughing, by touching contaminated objects, and by direct contact
with infected nasal or throat secretions. Infected droplets and
secretions can remain contagious on surfaces for up to 2 hours.
Complications from measles can include ear infection, diarrhea and
pneumonia, encephalitis (an inflammation of the brain), and even
death.

Health care providers who treat patients with a suspected case of
measles should immediately call their local health department and/or
the Pennsylvania Department of Health at 1-877-PA-HEALTH
(877-724-3258) for consultation and to arrange testing.

Townsville residents have been urged to be on the lookout for measles
symptoms following a confirmed case in Alice Springs in a traveller
who had passed through North Queensland.

The Northern Territory (NT) Health Department said the unvaccinated
tourist had travelled through Townsville and Cairns from 4 to 8 Aug
2011 while infectious with the virus. A Queensland Health spokesman
said residents needed to be aware but not unduly alarmed following
confirmation of the case. He said there had been no suspected cases
reported in North Queensland since the diagnosis in Alice Springs.

"The NT Health Department has informed Queensland Health that the
person would not have acquired the illness in North Queensland," he
said. "There have been no locally acquired cases of measles in the
Townsville and Cairns regions in 2011, and therefore no outbreaks."
This recent case should be a timely reminder for all Queenslanders to
make sure they have been vaccinated against measles." Symptoms usually
start around 10 days after infection but can take longer, with a range
of between 7 to 18 days. According to the Federal Government's
Department of Health and Ageing, there have been 16 measles cases
measles in Queensland this year.

Auckland can only be sure its measles outbreak is over when no new
cases are confirmed in 4 weeks, a public health doctor says. As of
this morning [22 Aug 2011]there were 111 confirmed cases of the
disease in Auckland in the latest outbreak to hit the city. 6
unimmunised people are in quarantine to stop the spread of the disease
and 8 patients have required hospitalisation. A further 5 cases of
rubella have also been confirmed.

Dr Richard Hoskins of the Auckland Regional Public Health Service
(ARPHS) says the number of new cases over the past 2 weeks has
decreased but it is not time to relax yet. "Measles is highly
infectious and one case in a group where immunity is low can rapidly
lead to many more cases over the next 2 weeks," he says. "It usually
takes 4 weeks with no new cases before we are confident an outbreak
has finished."

ARPHS aims to have 95 per cent of children immunised at 15 months and
again at the age of 4. Dr Hoskins says this would reduce the risk of
this type of outbreak reoccurring in Auckland.

Most cases in the latest outbreak have occurred in west Auckland with
some cases confirmed in central Auckland, North Shore, and Manukau.

Since last week [week of 15 Aug 2011], 2 more cases of measles have
been recorded in the Waikato [region, upper North Island of New
Zealand] bringing the total number of cases in the region to 21. The
latest cases were in adults, and medical officer of health Dr Anita
Bell says they may have links to the Te Awamutu area.

Of the 21 cases 20 have been in people who were unimmunised, with one
person having only received one of the 2 recommended doses of the
measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine. Dr Bell says this is a
testament to how effective the vaccine is in protecting people from
becoming infected. "Immunisation is the only protection from this
potentially serious disease," she says. "Immunisation protects not
only the individual, but also blocks the spread of this disease within
our communities."
