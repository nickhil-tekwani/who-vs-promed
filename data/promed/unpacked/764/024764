A 5th pony has died in Chincoteague [Virginia] this year [2018]. Rain Dancer died Monday [3 Dec 2018] from what is colloquially known as "swamp cancer," the town's volunteer fire company posted on Facebook. The illness is a fungus-like infection. "This baby just couldn't kick it and developed some ligament and tendon issues related to this disease," the fire company wrote on Facebook.

Rain Dancer's death follows 4 others earlier this year [2018]. In April [2018], 2 ponies -- Surf Queen and Wild Island Orchid -- died after they became stuck in the mud. Another, Butterfly Kisses, died the day after the annual pony swim in what officials called a "freak accident." Then Essie died from "swamp cancer" in October [2018].

The department has been posting regular updates as it works to combat the disease among its herd. Some ponies had surgery. In October [2018], volunteers posted on Facebook that the fungus "looks exactly like sesame seeds" that "bunch up in one area like grapes and then spread to other areas."

The fire company said Tuesday [4 Dec 2018] that the pony population is not "out of the woods yet on this swamp cancer situation. Our vet has been up here every other day and of course our great team of cowboys have basically put their lives on hold attending to these ponies."
