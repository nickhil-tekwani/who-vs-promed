[1] Norovirus - UK, new emerging norovirus variant

UK: new emerging Norovirus variant
-------------------------------------------------
The Virus Reference Department (VRD) at the Health Protection Agency's (HPA)
Centre for Infections has recently reported an increasing proportion of
norovirus outbreaks caused by a new variant of the genogroup II.4
[Bristol/1993/UK (Grimsby)] strain of the virus. Capsid sequencing indicates
conserved amino acid changes within the virus capsid, which defined this new
variant, when compared to other strains of this genotype such as Farmington
Hills and Hunter 284 strains, the latter being the most predominant strain
until the end of 2005. The new variant was 1st detected in December 2005.
The table shows the number of outbreaks sampled in the UK up to May 2006. In
April and May 2006, the proportion of all genogroup II.4 strains that were
identified as new variant was 27/93 (29 per cent) and 36/63 (57 per cent),
respectively.
This new variant has also been reported from The Netherlands, France, and
Denmark. In recent weeks, several cruise ship outbreaks have been reported
in the UK media and elsewhere in Europe. Outbreak strains from 2 of the
cruise ship outbreaks have been identified as the new variant.
Table: Emergence of a new GII-4 variant strain associated with outbreaks of
gastroenteritis in the UK in 2006:
Month / Total no. referred / Total no. genotyped / per cent typed / Total
GII -4 / per cent identified as GII-4 / Total GII-4 variant / per cent GII-4
variant
January 2006 / 184 / 63 / 34.2 / 47 / 74.6 / 4 / 8.5
February 2006 / 257 / 63 / 24.5 / 52 / 82.5 / 8 / 15.4
March 2006 / 218 / 109 / 50.0 / 94 / 86.2 / 23 / 24.5
April 2006 / 208 / 97 / 46.6 / 93 / 95.9 / 27 / 29.0
May 2006 / 145 / 68 / 46.9 / 63 / 92.6 / 36 / 57.1
The HPA's Environmental and Enteric Diseases Department (EEDD) and VRD are
currently reviewing the epidemiological and microbiological information and
trying to find out more about these outbreaks. A notification has been sent
out through the regional epidemiologists and gastrointestinal illness leads
in HPA regions, as well as through the Clinical Virology Network, to achieve
comparable data sets from 2005 and 2006 to investigate these outbreaks in
more detail. The aim is to compare outbreaks caused by the new variant to
the outbreaks caused by the other variants. This seasonal pattern is
unusual, as norovirus outbreaks normally decline by the summer. Unusual
seasonal patterns occurring in the past have coincided with the emergence of
novel strains (1); further investigations are needed to explore whether this
new variant of the genogroup II.4 strain is likely to emerge as the
predominant outbreak strain.

[2] Norovirus outbreak - Sydney, Australia

Norovirus gastroenteritis outbreak in Sydney, Australia
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
An epidemic of norovirus gastroenteritis has emerged in New South Wales,
Australia. Early cases occurred in February 2006 in a children's hospital
outbreak involving 102 individuals, 26 of whom were patients. The increasing
number of cases of acute gastroenteritis amongst adults and children
presenting to acute facilities prompted increased surveillance for
norovirus. In May 2006, norovirus was detected in 95 of 405 (23.5 per cent)
stool samples received from patients treated at 5 different hospitals within
the South Eastern Sydney and Illawarra regions as well as referred samples
from private laboratories. A preliminary investigation has shown the
predominance of variants closely related to the Farmington Hills/02/US
(GII.4) and Sydney C14/02/AU (GII.3) strains.
