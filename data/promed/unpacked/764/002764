MYSTERY DISEASE - HAWAII RFI
============================
I was recently contacted by a physician about a possible zoonotic
disease associated with manual removal of ticks (Rhipicephalus
sanguineus). The symptoms are flu like and duration is about 4 to 6
weeks. Diagnostic tests are usually normal except sometimes a low
platelet count and some cold agglutins. Occurance is sporadic and
there are few cases considering the number of tick infested dogs.
Patients seem to respond to tertracylcline antibiotics if they should
by chance be put on one. I know we have Ehrlichia canis and Ehrlichia
platys in dogs. I also am aware of a patient diagnosed with Q-fever.
Is there anything new with borrelia sp. or bartonella sp. ? Is
Ehrlichia platys zoonotic? This is ocurring in Hawaii on the island
of Kauai, and as far as I know , we don't have lyme disease.

My father (walterh@aloha.net) and I are practicing veterinarians on
the island of Kauai, state of Hawaii. The physician is also from the
island of Kauai.
