[Now that the West Nile virus (WNV) surveillance data reported to the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) through ArboNET are
appearing weekly in MMWR, ProMED-mail will no longer provide abstracted
information from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) West Nile virus
maps. A summary map of the current situation is reproduced in MMWR, and the
more detailed USGS maps, down to county level in some categories, can be
accessed via <http://westnilemaps.usgs.gov> for anyone requiring such
detailed information.
Now that the 2003 West Nile virus season is in full swing, only extensions
of West Nile virus geographic range or host species, and exceptional items,
will be posted separately from these weekly updates. - Mod.CP]

[The following are extracts from a report of a paper presented by Thomas
Unnasch and others (University of Alabama at Birmingham) at a meeting of
the Ecological Society of America on 4 Aug 2003. It describes new data on
the transmission and dispersal of West Nile virus by birds. - Mod.CP]
West Nile virus and the brown-headed cowbird
--------------------------------------------
The primary hosts of West Nile virus (WNV) are birds. Mosquitoes that
normally feed only on birds maintain a cycle of infection within them, and
the virus breaks out of that cycle to infect other species only when
"bridge vectors" -- mosquitoes that bite both humans and birds -- come into
contact with an infected bird. For that reason, the degree of contact
between bird and mosquito [may be] a major factor determining whether the
virus crosses the species barrier. When contact is high, the virus [is
amplified] more [extensively], and there is a [greater] chance that the
bridge vector will come into contact with it.
To investigate how the degree of contact affects viral levels, and hence
the risk of infection for humans, Thomas Unnasch of the University of
Alabama at Birmingham and colleagues analyzed the stomach contents of
bird-biting mosquitoes in 3 US states: New Jersey, New York, and Tennessee.
They used a reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay to detect
the presence of WNV and another sensitive assay to determine the species of
origin of the mosquitoes' blood meals.
At all the test sites, they found that of the 24 bird species on which the
mosquitoes fed, 3 [avian] species accounted for more than 50 per cent of
the blood the mosquitoes had ingested. Of these, the most abundant was the
brown-headed cowbird. The American crow seemed not to be to the mosquitoes'
liking at any of the sites, although American crows are regarded as
"sentinels" for the arrival of WNV, because they are highly susceptible to
it and die off quickly once infected.
In the WNV studies, the researchers were surprised to find that the birds
the mosquitoes preferred to bite were not endemic to the swamps the
mosquitoes inhabited. The birds' usual habitats were grasslands or higher
altitude ecosystems. According to Unnasch, that suggests the mosquitoes'
habitat could be larger than had been previously thought, and the
mosquitoes might forage outside swamp areas before returning to them to
digest their meals and lay their eggs. At the same time, forest clearance
could be enabling grassland-dwelling cowbirds to stray closer to
mosquito-ridden areas. "What we are seeing is a consistent pattern of these
arboviral vectors targeting just a very few species," he says.
His team also found that in July and August 2003, a higher proportion of
the mosquitoes' blood meals came from hosts other than birds. Before that
July drop-off, however, birds were their main targets. Unnasch thinks that
the mosquitoes might be zeroing in on fledglings of certain species. He
suggests that young birds are a dead-end population. Because they are
virally [or perhaps immunologically - Mod.CP] naive, they die quickly and
provide no reservoir for transmission to other birds or humans. However,
fledglings abound early in the season and transmission generally peaks in
late summer, he says, so more research is needed to explain the delayed
late summer peak.

Washington: Yakima County resident does not have WNV illness
------------------------------------------------------------
Follow-up testing by the Department of Health laboratory and negative test
results from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) show that
a Yakima County man in his 30s does not have West Nile virus (WNV)
infection. The case had been listed as "probable" pending confirmation and
has now been de-listed. The Yakima man had been admitted to hospital when
he first became ill in early August 2003 and is recovering.
"Its very important to follow through with confirmatory testing so we can
track new diseases like West Nile virus infection," said Dr Mira Leslie,
Washington State public health veterinarian. "West Nile virus is moving
across the country and may already be here, so it is important that people
take mosquito bite-prevention seriously, and reduce the places where
mosquitoes can live around their homes." The state Department of Health and
local health departments are working together on monitoring and testing
dead birds to detect West Nile virus and track the disease. The disease has
been spreading rapidly in other states this year, though it still has not
been confirmed in humans, horses or dead birds tested so far in Washington
in 2003. The disease appeared in Washington in 2002 in 2 dead birds and 2
horses. State and local health agencies also provide education on mosquito
bite prevention and reducing mosquito breeding sites around homes.

Navajo Nation: nearly 4500 horses vaccinated against WNV infection
------------------------------------------------------------------
Nearly 4500 horses of the Navajo Nation have been vaccinated against West
Nile virus (WNV) infection, Navajo health officials announced. Blood
samples from some horses were sent to state labs in Arizona, but results
have not been returned because of a backlog at the lab. As of Mon 26 Aug
2003, 4498 horses across the reservation had been vaccinated, said Scott
Bender, special projects veterinarian with the Navajo Nation Veterinary and
Livestock Program.
"However, keep in mind that the total number of horses who have received
the WNV vaccination shot is much higher because many horses have been
vaccinated throughout the year by our programs, as well as by private
veterinarians," Bender said. The Navajo Veterinary and Livestock
vaccination program will run through 17 Sep 2003.
The tribe also has completed the final draft of its action plan for dealing
with a WNV outbreak. The Navajo Division of Health will print a special
book about WNV. It will be distributed at the 57th annual Navajo Nation
Fair here.

[The states that remain free of cases of West Nile virus infection in
humans and other animals are Hawaii, Alaska, Idaho, Nevada, and Oregon. A
suspected human case in Washington State has not been confirmed, but West
Nile virus was detected there in birds and equines in 2002. - Mod.CP]
