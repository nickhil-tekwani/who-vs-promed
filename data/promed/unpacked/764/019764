The implications here would seem to be somewhat ominous. Plague was tested
at Aralsk, Nukus, and Rebirth Island (which is in the northwestern area of
the Aral Sea). There have been some reports that the Kazak government has
continued some of the research into several agents for use as biological
weapons at the former Soviet facility at Stepnogorsk, although Stepnogorsk
is rather far away from the focus of this outbreak.
Plague, generally speaking, would not warrant a response on the level that
this outbreak seems to have produced. Has the Kazak ministry of defense
had any involvement with the response to this outbreak or has there been
any kind of statement from Defense Ministry?

Whilst this may seem that there is a more serious situation than normal,
that is only if the other contacts have actually been hospitalized. The
posting says they have been sent to the hospital and have no signs of
plague. It may just be that they were asked to go for a check up rather
than being hospitalised, so perhaps we shouldn't read too much into this
too soon or that it could be linked to the island dumping ground in the
Aral Sea until we have more information?
You may think this picky. If so I apologise, but as the moderator notes,
plague is not unexpected at this time of year in that part of the world.
Indeed in neighbouring
Mongolia where I used to work, cars are regularly checked during the summer
to ensure that no marmot pelts are brought into Ulaanbaatar by returning
hunters precisely because of the risk of spreading plague.
