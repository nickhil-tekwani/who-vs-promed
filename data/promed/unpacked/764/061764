Anthrax has killed 37 cattle on a northeast Montana ranch now under
quarantine, the state veterinarian said Thursday.
Anthrax was last confirmed in the state in 1999, the Department of
Livestock said. But hundreds of cases have been reported this year in
neighboring North Dakota and South Dakota. The Montana ranch,
northwest of Culbertson, was placed under quarantine Monday on
suspicion of anthrax, later confirmed. Hundreds of remaining cattle
were moved to a different pasture, and animals deemed susceptible or
possibly exposed were given antibiotics and vaccinations, state
veterinarian Tom Linfield said. He said it's reasonable to expect
more local cases following an outbreak, and ranchers in the area were
told to be vigilant.

Anthrax has killed 37 cattle in northeast Montana, and additional
cases wouldn't be surprising, the state veterinarian said Thursday.
The ranch where the cattle lived, northwest of Culbertson, is under
quarantine and has been since Monday, Tom Linfield said. That's when
the Montana Department of Livestock first learned that anthrax was
suspected, he said. Hundreds of remaining cattle were moved to a
different pasture, and animals deemed susceptible or possibly exposed
were given antibiotics and vaccinations, he said. A 2nd round of
vaccinations is due within 10 days, and the premise will remain under
quarantine for about 40 days, the department said.
Anthrax was last confirmed in the state in 1999, the department said.
Meanwhile, the state Department of Public Health and Human Services
said in a statement that the outbreak poses "little threat" to humans.
Jim Murphy, a disease surveillance specialist with the department,
said officials came to that conclusion after consulting with the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
