In the wake of two elephant deaths from tuberculosis, zoos and circuses in
the US will have to periodically test the animals and their handlers for the
disease. The new rules, designed to protect elephants from infection by
their handlers, were introduced by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA).
They come after two elephants at the same circus died in 1996 in Los Angeles
within a week of one another. Postmortems showed that both animals were
infected with _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_.
In a paper to appear in Emerging Infectious Diseases posted on the Internet
last week (http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/eidtext.htm I think - I couldn't
get it to work this morning), Kathleen Michalak of the McHenry County
Department of Health in Woodstock, Illinois, examined handlers at a elephant
house run by the circus in the state, where the two animals had lived before
their trip to California. Eleven of the handlers tested positive for TB, and
DNA fingerprinting showed they had the same strain as the elephants.
It is not clear whether the one of the handlers infected the elephants or
whether the elephants picked up the bacterium from elsewhere, and then
infected their human care givers. According to the USDA, elephants will
have to
undergo regular tests to see if they have tuberculosis, including cell
cultures taken from their trunks. If they test positive for _M.
tuberculosis_, they will have to be treated with antibiotics. Handlers must
also give annual sputum samples to test for the bacterium.

[It is pleasing to note that the USDA is taking an aggressive attitude on
the risks of the human -> elephant route of infection. However, I must
declare a veterinary interest, in spite of the probable risks of later
elephant -> human spread. - Mod.MHJ
