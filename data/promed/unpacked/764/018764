Purwokerto, Central Java: bird flu virus attacks vaccinated chickens
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Bird flu H5N1 attacked hundreds of thousands of layer chickens in
several farms in Kabupaten Banyumas, Central Java [Jawa Tengah].
Infected chickens had received avian influenza vaccination.

The bird flu massive attack was distributed evenly in Sumbang,
Karanglewes, Kedungbanteng Serat, and Cilongok within weeks.

A 50-year-old chicken farmer reported that thousands of infected
chicken reared in Desa Limpakuwus, Kecamatan Sumbang had been
vaccinated previously. "Vaccination does not assure immunity in
chickens. Vaccination should be done repeatedly to avoid infection,"
said [the farmer] on Tuesday [8 Sep 2009].

Avian influenza infection did not kill chickens that received
vaccination, but it caused suppression of egg production.

[According to the newswire above, the vaccinated birds got infected
but there was no mortality. Is this indeed avian influenza virus?
And, in case affirmative, is it HPAI H5N1? Laboratory results are
anticipated with interest.

The following report on the H5N1 situation in Indonesia is derived
from FAO's periodic publication "FAOAIDEnews," Animal Influenza
Disease Emergency Situation Update No 61 of 31 Aug 2009:

"Indonesia continues to report a high number of H5N1 HPAI outbreaks
in poultry, as it has for the past 3 years. HPAI is endemic on Java,
Sumatra, Sulawesi, and probably Bali islands, with sporadic outbreaks
reported elsewhere. Village prevalence varies widely. Only 2 of its
33 provinces have not reported the occurrence of H5N1 HPAI. The high
number of reported outbreaks each month is partially explained by the
implementation of the 'participatory disease surveillance and
response' (PDSR)2 programme that targets village-type poultry
production systems (mainly backyard) and reports evidence of virus
circulation in the village environment.

The programme is financially supported by FAO with USAID (United
States Agency for International Development) and AusAID (Australian
Government Overseas Aid Program), and is operating in 331/448 (74
percent) districts through 31 Local Disease Control Centres (LDCCs)
in 27 out of 33 provinces in Java, Sumatra, Bali, Sulawesi, and
Kalimantan, including all known endemically infected areas.

Larger and less densely-populated provinces report HPAI outbreaks
less often than more densely populated provinces.

During June, PDSR officers visited 2112 villages, of which 193 (7.1
percent) were infected (187 were newly found, while the remaining 6
carried over the infection status from the previous month). This was
lower than the May 2009 infection rate of 9.1 percent. During the
previous 6 months, PDSR officers visited 10 667 villages (16.5
percent) in the 331 Districts under PDSR surveillance. Since May
2008, they have visited about 34 percent of villages under coverage
of the program. An average of 14.3 percent of the villages visited
during the previous 6 months was classified as infected at the time
of visit. Bali continued to have infected villages. Cases over the
last 6 months were concentrated in provinces on Java and Sulawesi
islands other than Gorontalo and North Sulawesi Provinces. - Mod.AS]
