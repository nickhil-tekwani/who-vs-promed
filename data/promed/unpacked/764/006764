Saudi Arabia said Friday [24 May 2013] it would send samples taken from animals possibly infected with a deadly SARS-like virus to the United States for testing in a bid to find the source of disease.

The Saudi health ministry has "collected large samples from bats and other animals, including camels, sheep and cats," said Saudi Deputy Health Minister Ziad Memish.

So far, there have been 44 lab-confirmed cases worldwide of the virus, which until now has been known as the novel coronavirus, or nCoV-EMC, but was this week redubbed the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, or MERS.

Saudi Arabia counts by far the most cases, with 30 confirmed infections and 17 fatalities, while cases have also been detected in Jordan, Qatar, Tunisia, the United Arab Emirates, Germany, Britain and France.

Memish told diplomats gathered in Geneva for the World Health Assembly, the decision-making body of the World Health Organization, that his country until now had not been able to send samples from animals besides bats to the United States. "But now ... we've got an approval to move these samples, and they will be shipped for testing," he said.

The virus is a cousin of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus, which triggered a scare 10 years ago when it erupted in east Asia, leaping to humans from animal hosts and eventually killing some 800 people.

Scientists at the Erasmus medical center in Rotterdam have determined that the virus appears to infect the body via a docking point in lung cells, suggesting bats may be a natural reservoir for it.

Bats were also pinpointed as a likely natural reservoir for SARS in a 2005 study and are known carriers of the deadly ebolavirus.

[So far, no animal species has been shown to be the maintenance host or vector of MERS-CoV. Bats have been mentioned as possible candidates (ProMED-mail posting 20130122.1508656). Later, a 73-year-old male patient from Abu-Dhabi, who died in a hospital in Munich, Germany on 26 Mar 2013, was reported by a German physician to have been exposed to a sick camel, one of his racing camels (posting 20130405.1623188).

Results of the tests in the USA in animal samples to be submitted from Saudi Arabia are anticipated with interest.

In relation to SARS in China, the natural reservoir of the causative coronavirus was considered to be the horseshoe bat, while palm civets were found to be playing the role of hosts for intermediate viral amplification. - Mod.AS
