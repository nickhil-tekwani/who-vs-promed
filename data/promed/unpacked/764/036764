Vesicular stomatitis in Belize

[I am so happy the OIE requested more information. We do know the
virus type but not where the tests were run or what type of tests
were used. The fact that this infection is a New Jersey-type VS is
about all we know. Even the location of the outbreak is not evident
from reading the report. Numbers of susceptible horses are missing,
so it appears as if there are no equine cases; but if so, why were
they listed? Fortunately, help -- in the form of updated information
-- will be on the way, when the OIE's request is responded to by the
animal health officials in Belize.
In any case, Andy Comer, in the 1997 reference below, provided a very
comprehensive but succinct overview of this insect-borne vesicular
disease that can be mistaken for Foot and Mouth Disease in clinically
ill cattle. However, it can be distinguished from FMD if horses
start getting vesicular lesions, as horses are not susceptible to the
FMD virus. - Mod.PC]
