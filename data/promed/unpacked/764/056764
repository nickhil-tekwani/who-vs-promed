The investigation into the current outbreak of salmonellosis linked
with the consumption of duck eggs is ongoing, with 5 new cases in
August 2010. The latest confirmed cases brings the total number to
date to 24 and it is now the largest food poisoning outbreak of
salmonellosis recorded in recent years in Ireland.

In light of this, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) today,
14 Sep 2010, reiterated its advice on the safe consumption of duck
eggs. The people infected have ranged from 5 months to 80 years of
age. The latest cases tend to be linked with the consumption of duck
eggs from small backyard flocks or private farms. The confirmed cases
are nationwide. Hen eggs are not implicated in this outbreak.

The FSAI has advised to only consume duck eggs that have been
thoroughly cooked and to cease using raw duck eggs in any dishes that
will not be cooked thoroughly prior to eating. It also cautions on
the importance of good hygiene practices being followed, such as
washing hands and preparation surfaces after handling or using duck
eggs.

Prof Alan Reilly, chief executive, FSAI said: "We are advising
caterers, retailers, and consumers to treat duck eggs in the same way
as they would raw chicken. We all know that we should never eat raw
chicken. This is a risk that is well understood by everyone, both in
terms of ensuring it is cooked thoroughly and also by maintaining
good hygiene practices, thereby preventing cross contamination
between raw food and ready-to-eat food."

He continued: "However, people may have forgotten that duck eggs have
been associated with _Salmonella_ in the past and therefore, are not
taking the correct precautions today. The fact that the outbreak is
ongoing, underlines the huge importance attached to maintaining
stringent hygiene practices when handling raw duck eggs. Even when
duck eggs look clean, they may still have salmonellae on the outside
of the shell and sometimes carry it on the inside of the egg."

"The symptoms of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Typhimurium DT8
infection vary from mild discomfort due to vomiting and diarrhea, to
life threatening illness. Infants, pregnant women, the frail elderly,
and the sick are most at risk from food poisoning. Anyone who may
have these symptoms and suspects it may have been from recently
eating duck eggs should contact their doctor for advice," added Prof
Reilly.

The FSAI is working in collaboration with the Department of
Agriculture, Fisheries and Food on control measures for commercial
flocks and also smaller backyard flocks on private farms. A code of
practice has been published for commercial flock owners and also
guidelines have been published for producers of small quantities of
duck eggs from backyard flocks. Work is also underway by Bord Bia
[Irish Food Board] to develop a new quality assurance scheme to
ensure a safe source of duck eggs in the future.

The FSAI is continuing to work closely with the Health Protection
Surveillance Centre; the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and
Food; and various local authorities to control this outbreak and to
prevent further cases of illness.

[Duck eggs are larger than hen eggs and richer in flavor, lending a
creamy depth to baked dishes. The shells of duck eggs are slightly
tougher to crack. The tougher shell gives duck eggs a longer shelf
life, about 6 weeks in the refrigerator, inside is a yolk that is
larger in proportion to the white than that of a chicken egg.

We commonly associate raw or poorly cooked chicken eggs (alone or in
recipes) with a risk of salmonellosis acquisition. The risk is also
present for the eggs of other fowl such as ducks (as shown in this
report), ostriches, and quail.
