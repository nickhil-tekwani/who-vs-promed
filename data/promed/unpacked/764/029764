Citrus canker eradication program enters final stage
----------------------------------------------------
The Department of Primary Industries says only a few people still have
concerns about the Government's citrus canker [CC] eradication program in
central Queensland. By the end of the program, there will be no citrus
trees left in the Emerald area.
Over the next few weeks 100 000 commercial trees, 4500 backyard trees and
2700 hectares of native citrus will be destroyed in the final phase of the
eradication process.
2 Emerald citrus growers have won a $2.3 million [USD 1.77 million]
contract to remove the commercial trees. According to Chris Adriaansan, The
Department of Primary Industries' says destruction should move quickly
despite a 1 week delay. As a consequence of CC, the citrus industry has
been crippled on the central highlands.
The state and Federal Governments are contributing $4.6 million each to an
$11.5 million package to help growers, with the remaining money to come
from industry and the local community.

[This appears to be the end of the road for the Emerald operation. A Senate
inquiry into the outbreak has already been told that the owner of Evergreen
Farms, where the disease was first detected, was allegedly illegally
importing plant cuttings from overseas. There are also questions about how
authorities handled the matter. It seems that no one can provide definitive
information on the source of the citrus canker outbreak.
