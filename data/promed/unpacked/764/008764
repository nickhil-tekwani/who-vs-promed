China has confirmed a new outbreak of African swine fever (ASF) in northwest China's Ningxia Hui autonomous region. On a local farm in Yongning County, 26 pigs were confirmed infected with the viral disease and 13 had died as of 11 p.m. [Sat 19 Jan 2019], said the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs on Sunday [20 Jan 2019], citing a report from the China Animal Disease Control Center.

A team has been dispatched to the area to give guidance, and local authorities have initiated an emergency response to isolate and cull the affected pigs and disinfect the venue. Transport of all pigs and related products out of or into the blockade zone is forbidden, the ministry added. It is believed ASF infects only pigs, and no humans or other species have thus far been infected. China reported its 1st case of the disease in August [2018] in the northeast province of Liaoning. Later outbreaks were reported in several other provincial regions.
