Re: Bordetella holmesii, pertussis-like illness - Canada (ON)
-------------------------------------------------------------
We appreciate ProMED-mail's posting of our initial report, and also
appreciate the Moderator's (Dr. Levison's) interesting questions and comments.
With respect to the question of whether our isolation of _B.
holmesii_ is related to the presence or absence of cephalexin in
culture or transport media, we think this unlikely. Indeed, all 5
isolates initially identified at the Ontario Central Public Health
Laboratory grew on Regan-Lowe charcoal agar with 20 ug/ml cephalexin,
and we have been able to grow all 6 isolates (a 6th isolate was
forwarded to us for reference identification) in the presence of up
to 40 ug/ml cephalexin. As such, our experience differs from that
described in Massachusetts (reference: Mazengia E, et al, J Clin
Micro 2000; 38(6): 2330-3).

The Moderator notes that Toronto has seen a marked increase in
pertussis rates since 2005, though the fact that most cases are IS481
PCR-positive but culture negative, and clinically quite mild (no
pertussis-related hospitalizations noted at the region's major
children's hospital) suggests that increased sensitivity of
laboratory methods may have led to the identification of individuals
with relatively mild infection and low organism burden. Nonetheless,
of 1340 specimens that tested positive for pertussis between January
2005 and March 2007, 104 (7.8 percent) were culture positive for _B.
pertussis_. In contrast, only 5 _B. holmesii_ isolates were
identified during the same period. As such, we think it unlikely that
_B. holmesii_ is a major contributor to increased local pertussis
rates. We recently presented a laboratory-based assessment of
pertussis epidemiology in the Greater Toronto Area at the meeting of
the Pediatric Academic Societies meeting; the abstract can be accessed at

[Many thanks for the additional data from Dr. Fisman and Ms.
Clatworthy. The _B. pertussis_ assay that targets insertion sequence
IS481 has been found to cross-react with isolates of _B. holmesii_
(see Reischl U, et al, J Clin Microbiol 2001; 39: 1963-6). Indeed,
Fisman and Jamieson reported that 4 of the actual nasopharyngeal
specimens that were culture-positive for _B. holmesii_ gave a
positive result by the PCR assay for IS481 (see ProMED-mail
_Bordetella holmesii_, pertussis-like illness - Canada (ON)
20070711.2215). However, the prevalence of _B. holmesii_ in the upper
respiratory tract of healthy individuals and its clinical
significance in patients with cough remain to be evaluated. In the
meantime, since the PCR assay for IS461 is not specific for _B.
pertussis_, other diagnostic tests would seem to be necessary. - Mod.ML]
