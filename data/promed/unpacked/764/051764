State and federal wildlife officials are investigating the deaths of
hundreds of seabirds turning up on the coasts of South Carolina (SC),
Georgia (GA), and Florida (FL).
Wildlife biologists say more than 1000 shearwaters -- large,
gull-like water birds that spend most of their lives far offshore
until they nest -- have been found dead over the past 2 weeks on
southeastern beaches. Since last week [25 Jun-1 Jul 2007], more than
160 of the dead birds have been found in South Carolina, including at
least 22 on Hilton Head Island.
Officials remain uncertain about what's causing the mass casualties,
but they say most of the birds recovered seem to have died of
dehydration and malnutrition during migration. "Most shearwater
carcasses recovered in South Carolina appear to be those of juvenile
birds," said Craig Watson, a wildlife biologist with the US Fish and
Wildlife Service in Charleston. "A small percentage has been found
alive. For some reason, these birds are dying, and most think it's
due to starvation," he said. "Whatever the reason, this appears to be
pretty significant; we just don't know how significant yet."
Biologists from the southeastern states are working with federal
agents to collect, tabulate and test bird carcasses to determine a
cause. Preliminary findings in Georgia and Florida indicate no
pathogen or disease including West Nile virus or avian influenza is
involved in the deaths, biologists said.
The problem surfaced in Florida about 2 weeks ago [see ProMED-mail
20070622.2014], and it's worked its way north since then, biologists
said. So far, more than 600 dead shearwaters have washed ashore in
Florida, and at least 100 were reported in Georgia.
The only common factor is that most of the birds are emaciated, said
Dr. Al Segars, a SC Department of Natural Resources veterinarian
who's helping to coordinate efforts to collect carcasses. Sometimes,
he said, they just run out of gas.
Each year, the birds migrate more than 7500 miles (about 12000 km)
from their breeding grounds on an isolated group of islands in the
South Atlantic to northern North America and Greenland. Typically,
the birds pass by South Carolina far offshore, usually near the Gulf
Stream or farther east, biologists said. "Unless you're a fisherman
and out by the Gulf Stream, you're not going to see these birds in
South Carolina," Watson said.
A similar die-off was reported in 2005, when dead birds washed up on
beaches from Florida to Virginia [see ProMED-mail 20050713.1990].
"It's not uncommon for some of these birds to die off during
migration, but the numbers here are significant enough to cause alarm
with natural-resources people internationally," said Jennifer Koches,
a spokeswoman for the US Fish and Wildlife Service in Charleston. "No
bird can sustain this type of die-off year after year."
The SC Department of Natural Resources requests that people who find
a dead or sick shorebird:
- record the location, date, time, and species found and send
information to Dr. Al Segars at <segarsa@dnr.sc.gov>. Leave the bird
where it was found.
- if live birds are found, do not attempt to catch or handle.
Seabirds can inflict stabbing injuries. Attempting to handle them
also can cause the bird to injure itself.
Greater shearwaters are gull-like in appearance, reaching 17 to 20
inches (43-51 cm) in body length with a 3- to 4-foot (0.9-1 m)
wingspan. Adults weigh about 2 pounds (0.9 kg). Their bodies are
mostly brown in color with a white underbelly and neck. The birds
have black, hooked bills with visible nostrils, pink webbed feet, and
dark spots just under the wing. Shearwaters breed in the Southern
Hemisphere at a group of isolated islands between southern South
America and Africa called Tristan da Cunha. Each year, they migrate
more than 7500 miles (about 12000 km) to portions of North America,
including northern New England states and Canada and farther north
near Greenland.
Shearwaters spend most of their lives far offshore and are rarely
seen in South Carolina. The birds fly close to the ocean with stiff
wings and few wing beats. They feed on squid and other fish, which
they catch from the surface or by plunge diving.

[The weather is a bit different than usual. There are floods in Texas
and droughts along the eastern seaboard so starvation of a large
number of birds may fit with the seemingly unusual weather pattern.
