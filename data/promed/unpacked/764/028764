Rabies Infection Survivor to Leave Hospital on Sat 1 Jan 2005
--------------------------------------------------
The Fond du Lac teenager who became the 1st person known to have
survived rabies without vaccination expects to come home from the
hospital on New Year's Day. The 15-year-old girl has spent nearly 11
weeks at Children's Hospital of Wisconsin in suburban Milwaukee,
which plans to discharge her on Sat 1 Jan 2005. In recent weeks, the
girl has worked to regain her weight, strength, and coordination.
Only 5 people in the world besides the Fond du Lac girl are known to
have survived rabies virus infection after the onset of symptoms, but
they had received standard treatment, a series of rabies vaccine
shots, or vaccine ahead of time.
One of the girl's doctors, Rodney Willoughby, said the teen is
medically sound and should eventually resume high school, although
she still shows some effects from the illness. Her mother said in a
statement that the family anticipates a long recovery. "My daughter
does not yet look or sound entirely like she used to, but she has
come tremendously far and her progress continues," she said. "We're
looking forward to being home together. We haven't had a chance to
celebrate Christmas yet as a family, and having her home with us is
the best gift we could have wished for."
The teenager was bitten by a rabid bat 12 Sep 2004 at church and went
to a doctor 13 Oct 2004 with only vague symptoms of fatigue and
tingling and numbness of the hand where the bite occurred. She was
hospitalized a few days later. As her condition worsened, doctors at
Children's Hospital induced a coma and administered a combination of
drugs. She was in intensive care for nearly 2 months and eventually
came out of the coma. At home, she will continue with speech,
physical, and occupational therapy, according to the hospital.
Willoughby, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at Children's
Hospital, has said the treatment used on the teenager must be
duplicated in another survivor before it can be credited as a rabies
treatment.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said it is
re-evaluating its approach to human rabies because of the results.
