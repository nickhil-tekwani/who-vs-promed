Saskatchewan and other regions of Western Canada are in the midst of the largest equine infectious anemia (EIA) outbreak the area has seen in years, involving more than 70 horses and 22 different properties thus far in 2012. In response, 2 veterinarians discussed the importance of disease surveillance in controlling -- and possibly even eradicating -- the deadly disease from North American horse populations.

EIA is an incurable infectious disease of horses that is spread by biting insects such as flies. Like the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), there is neither cure nor vaccine for EIA. All positive horses are either humanely euthanized or placed under lifelong quarantine.

First recognized in North America in Wisconsin in the late 1800s, EIA outbreaks were increasingly identified across the continent, causing alarm throughout the industry. The Coggins test, which reliably identifies affected horses, was introduced in the 1970s and plays a key role in stopping virus spread from infected horses, to the insect vectors, to more horses.

Is EIA an emerging disease?
Stacey Oke, DVM, MSc: "We don't know if EIA is a re-emerging disease, or whether the recent upswing in cases just relates to a limited number of local events that don't have much of an impact on the broader population," said Scott Weese, a professor in the Department of Pathobiology at the University of Guelph's Ontario Veterinary College. "One small outbreak can contribute to a large increase in the number of cases seen in Canada in a year. However, one small local outbreak, if undetected, can also lead to a large regional, national, or international outbreak given the right conditions. Only time and testing will tell us whether this is an emerging problem or a minor blip."

According to the latest statistics, less than 1 per cent of the horses residing in Saskatchewan are voluntarily tested for the EIA virus. Similarly, an estimated 75-80 per cent of horses in the United States are not currently tested for EIA, despite some states requiring annual testing of every horse residing within those borders.

"In many ways EIA is a disease that would be very easy to contain, if not eradicate, because we have a good test and horses are the only animals that are infected," said Scott Weese, a professor in the Department of Pathobiology at the University of Guelph's Ontario Veterinary College in Canada.

That said, Weese explained, "it would take time, commitment, and money, to ensure all horses are tested, and the willingness of the industry to accept the resulting need to euthanize an undetermined number of horses." Currently, in both Canada and the United States, testing is voluntary and owners are required to foot the bill.

"Many horses are tested regularly; however, there's actually more of a need to test horses that have never been tested before rather than horses that have been tested and been negative multiple times," added Weese.

Angela M Pelzel, a Western regional epidemiologist with the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service Veterinary Services, concurs and added, "State and federal regulatory officials have long lamented that if we were able to test every horse in the US we could eradicate this disease in our country."

Pelzel explained that large numbers of horses are being tested over and over that reside in or travel to states that haven't had an EIA case in many years. "Rather than using targeted surveillance, which we do in most of our other regulatory programs, we seem to only use convenient sample streams in which to test [for EIA]," she said. "Convenient sampling will only get you so far, as you can see."

The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) has thoughtfully provided educational material to owners, to state authorities, and to all of us. There is an educational brochure on EIA at the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service page at http://www.aphis.usda.gov/animal_health/animal_diseases/eia/downloads/eia-1996.pdf. Information regarding additional resources may be found in ProMED-mail post 20100415.1226.

Equine infectious anemia (EIA) affects Equidae and is caused by an equid-specific lentivirus in the retrovirus family, equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV). Although the majority of persistent infections appear to have minimal clinical consequences, EIA may be seen in epizootic form with high morbidity and mortality. Infection can be accurately diagnosed with laboratory tests. Because there are no effective and safe vaccines, many countries have established control programs based on serologic testing.

EIA is a bloodborne infection; the virus can be found free in the plasma or cell-associated. Infection with EIAV appears to persist for life and, in nature, blood-feeding insects initiate most infections by mechanical transfer of infective blood between horses in close proximity. Tabanids, horseflies, and deer flies appear to be the most efficient vectors because the pain of their bite initiates host defensive behavior that interrupts feeding and results in additional host-seeking behavior. As EIAV has not been shown to multiply in insects, infected equids appear to be the only reservoir of the virus. Iatrogenic transmission has a high epizootic potential that can be avoided by standard precautions, such as, disposal or decontamination of needles and equipment between horses.

Exposed equids generally support viral replication for days to weeks before antibodies to EIAV can be detected. The incubation period ranges from 10 to 45 days or more, usually lasting 21-42 days after natural transmission. Peak viremia often occurs during a febrile episode before the horse becomes test-positive. These acute signs often go unrecognized in horses on pasture and may be accompanied by a mild reduction in platelet counts and transient inappetence. Often, infection is noted only after routine surveillance testing for EIA or when the horse develops recurring clinical bouts of fever accompanied by marked platelet reductions, petechial hemorrhages, anemia, depression, weight loss, cachexia, and dependent edema (hallmarks of the chronic form of EIA). EIAV infection can therefore present as an inapparent infection or as an acute or chronic disease. The clinical manifestations are determined in part by the viral strain and dose, and the genetic makeup and status of the immune system of the equid. For example, strains of EIAV adapted by rapid serial passage in horses can kill horses within 14 days of infection but may have no clinical effect on donkeys. Likewise, strains that produce no or mild clinical disease in adults have killed immunologically immature fetuses or immunodeficient foals. Frequently, EIAV enters a herd and is transmitted silently until the chronic form of the disease is noted. By that time, a high percentage of the herd can be infected.

Clinical diagnosis should be confirmed by serology. The agar gel immunodiffusion (AGID, Coggins) test is internationally accepted; antigen sources include cell culture-propagated virus and recombinant proteins. ELISA tests for detection of antibody against EIAV antigens are accepted in many countries and aid in the practical diagnosis of EIAV infection. The ELISA tests can be done in minutes (compared with 1-2 days for AGID test results) and used under field conditions. In all cases, positive ELISA tests should be confirmed by AGID before regulatory actions are taken because of the higher rate of false positive results. When combined, ELISA and AGID testing afford the highest level of sensitivity and specificity.

No specific treatment or vaccine is available. As EIAV-infected equids present the only known source of infection, antibody-positive animals should be kept at a safe distance (around 200 m) from other equids. The only recognized exception to this rule is the progeny of test-positive mares, which may possess maternal antibodies to EIAV. In the majority of cases, passive antibody against EIAV wanes to negative on AGID tests by 6-8 months of age.

The risk associated with maintaining EIAV-infected breeding stock varies. Field studies have indicated excellent success in raising test-negative foals from inapparent carriers of EIAV. The risks of infection in utero increase dramatically if clinical signs of EIA are seen in the mare prior to parturition. Unfortunately, it is not possible to accurately determine the risk posed by any EIAV-infected equid. As EIAV persists in each infected equid for life, most regulatory agencies assume all EIAV-positive equids pose the same high risk.
