[Some countries in the Middle East are located along wild bird migratory routes, suggesting a likely source of transmission and spread of the virus along such routes.

"Migratory wild birds, especially waterfowls, are the natural host and reservoir of avian influenza viruses. Within their respiratory or intestinal tracts, they can carry different avian influenza virus strains. Depending on the virus strain and the species of bird, the virus can be harmless or fatal to the wild bird. When birds have little or no symptoms of the virus, it allows them to spread the viruses between neighbouring countries or over long distances, along their migratory pathways. Wild birds also play a major role in avian influenza viruses evolution and maintenance during low seasons.

"The main wild species involved in the viral cycle of avian influenza are waterfowls, gulls, and shorebirds; however, the virus seems to pass easily between different bird species. Direct exposure of farmed birds to wild birds is a likely transmission route of the virus. Therefore, it is critical to limit their exposure to wild birds to lessen the risk of introduction of avian influenza into flocks" (https://www.woah.org/en/disease/avian-influenza/). - Mod.CRD
