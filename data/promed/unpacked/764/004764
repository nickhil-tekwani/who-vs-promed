A baby is recovering at North Central Baptist Hospital after contracting an extremely rare illness. There are only about 7 cases year of infant botulism in the state of Texas each year, but it can be a killer.

The parents knew something was very wrong with their 5-month-old baby girl. She was constipated, lethargic and couldn't keep her eyes open. "We did an MRI; we did an EEG of her head, heart studies; they did a spinal tap to make sure it wasn't meningitis," the mother said. Even after those tests, doctors couldn't figure it out. The baby got worse.

"On Fri 2 Aug 2018, before we figured out what it was, she had coded, and they had to resuscitate her and intubate her, and it was just really scary going through all this and seeing our baby pretty much in a coma," the mother said.

After reviewing her symptoms, doctors discovered the baby had infant botulism, a rare and potentially fatal illness caused by a toxin made by a bacterium. Doctors gave her an anti-toxin, and the baby began to recover.

Dr. Pedro Chavez made the diagnosis and has treated infant botulism a few times in his career. He says the most common place babies get the disease is from honey. "The spores in the bacterium can drop in the honey, and when they ingest it, it breaks down in the stomach and liberates the toxin," Chavez said.

The bacterium can also come from contaminated preserves and jams or from dust kicked up into the air. It could take several months or even as long as a year of rehab for the baby to bounce back from the illness.

[Initially, infant botulism was linked to feeding infants honey; most cases are no longer linked to this vehicle. Spores of _Clostridium botulinum_ are ubiquitous in the environment, and many times a specific source is not discovered. It should be noted that even totally breast-fed infants can develop this disease.

The following is extracted from the CDC report on infant botulism in New York City (ProMED-mail post Infant botulism - USA (New York City) 20030117.0144):

"Intestinal botulism is the commonest form of human botulism in the USA; about 100 cases are reported among infants in the USA annually. Intestinal botulism occurs rarely in older children and adults [this form has been also referred to as adult colonization botulism. - Mod.LL]. Intestinal botulism results from colonization and bacterial production of botulinum toxin in the colon. Swallowing ambient _Clostridium botulinum_ spores, which exist worldwide in soil and dust, has been proposed as the principal route of exposure; honey is an avoidable source of some causative spores. A common source of exposure is not usually identified; apparent clusters are rare and often remain unexplained after investigations are complete. In a cluster of infant botulism cases identified previously in the mid-Atlantic region of the USA, no common source of exposure was identified.

"Botulism should be suspected in previously healthy infants aged less than 12-months-old who are constipated and who exhibit weakness in sucking, swallowing, or crying; hypotonia [decreased muscle tone]; and progressive bulbar and extremity muscle weakness. About half of patients require mechanical ventilation during hospitalization. Lumbar puncture and brain imaging generally yield normal results but can help differentiate among other causes of flaccid weakness. When infant botulism is suspected, local and state health departments should be notified promptly to arrange diagnostic stool testing."

Although not specifically stated in this post, botulism immune globulin (BIG-IV) is indicated in infants with clinically diagnosed infant botulism, before diagnostic confirmation. The prompt use of this specific immunoglobulin leads to a significant decrease in both ICU and total hospital stay. Reviews regarding BIG - IV use and infant botulism can be found in the references below.
