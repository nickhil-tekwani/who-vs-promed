A total of 80 pigs in Mozambique's Maputo Province of Mozambique have died
of African Swine Fever (ASF), while 220 are infected with the disease since
March this year.
Americo Conceicao, head of the Provincial Animal-farming Services, warned
that tens of thousands of pigs will be lost if no precautions are made.
The first case of ASF was discovered in the pig farm at the veterinary
facility in the University of Eduardo Mondlane. The epidemic then spread to
the suburban areas of capital Maputo and nearby cities.
The pig-farming industry in southern Mozambique was almost destroyed when
ASF broke out in the province in 1995.
African swine fever is very infectious; it is a strong, resistant virus. It
can be transmitted through blood, saliva, dung, dead body, equipment and
water. Once infected, blue spots can be detected on the pig within 4 to 24
hours.

[ASF is a highly contagious hemorrhagic disease of pigs that produces a
wide range of clinical signs and lesions closely resembling those of hog
cholera, also known as classical swine fever. This is an economically
important disease, and is enzootic in many African countries and part of
Southern Europe.
ASF virus is a large enveloped DNA virus replicating primarily in cells of
the mononuclear phagocytic system. The prolonged period during which ASF
has been an enzootic disease in Africa has led to the selection of viruses
of varying virulence.
ASF virus is maintained in Africa by a natural cycle of transmission
between wart hogs (_Phacochoerus aethiopicus_) and the soft tick vector
_Ornithodoros moubata_, which inhabits wart hog burrows and therefore, is
unlikely ever to be eliminated. The spread of virus from the wildlife
reservoirs to domestic pigs can be either by the bite of an infected soft
tick or by ingestion of wart hog tissues.
Virulent viruses produce acute disease, and all body fluids and tissues
contain large amounts of infections virus from the onset of clinical
disease until death. Pigs usually become infected vie the oronasal route by
direct contact with infected pigs or by ingestion of waste food containing
unprocessed pig meat or pig meat products. The primary route of infection
is the upper respiratory tract, and virus replicates in the tonsil and
lymph nodes draining the head and neck.
Acute disease has an incubation time of 5-7 days, followed by high fever
(up to 42 degrees C) and death in 7-10 days. There is a loss of appetite,
depression, and hyperemia (redness) of the skin of the ears, abdomen and
legs; respiratory distress; bleeding from the nose or rectum; sometimes
diarrhea; and occasionally abortion. Chronic disease is characterized by
emaciation, swollen joints and respiratory problems.
There is no treatment and vaccine development has been unsuccessful. All
successful eradication programs have involved the rapid diagnosis,
slaughter, and disposal of all animals on infected premises. - Mod.TG
