Livestock death from anthrax -- Scotland
-------------
A cow has died of anthrax on a Scottish farm, it has been confirmed.
Health officials in East Dunbartonshire said the disease was found in
an animal which died several days ago. The area was cordoned off to
be disinfected; but it was stressed that the incident posed no risk
to the general public.
It is thought to be the first case of the disease in Scotland for 5
years. The cow was kept at Balcorrach farm in Lennoxtown. It was
confirmed on Sunday that it had died of anthrax several days earlier.
Police sealed off the farm to allow health officials at East
Dunbartonshire Council to burn all the areas where the animal had
been kept. Council spokesman David Maclavin said the bacteria could
be present in the ground where cattle and sheep were kept, and could
come to the surface after heavy rain.
But he stressed: "There is absolutely no risk to public health. This
is a naturally occurring bacterium, and these outbreaks do occur
occasionally. You would have to be in direct contact with an infected
animal to run a risk of catching anthrax. We are not talking about a
highly-refined laboratory strain of the disease."
The last case of anthrax in Scotland is thought to have been in 1997.

[The anthrax incidence in the United Kingdom is now truly sporadic
with usually a number of years between cases. In these circumstances
cases follow from land disturbance (trenching, bulldozing, and such).
Heavy rains are a traditional precursor, but how the rain achieves
the movement of spores to the soil surface is more a matter of theory
(the spores are hydrophobic) than hard knowledge. As it is December
and well outside the normal June-September "anthrax season," I would
want to rule out any chance that the dairy feed might be involved
before invoking "rain." - Mod.MHJ]
