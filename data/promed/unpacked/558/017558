With respect, I would like to point out that PPR is not a capripox. PPRV belongs to the _Morbillivirus_ genus, as was mentioned later in the post.

PPR is not a capripox, rather, it is a _Morbillivirus_, as per human measles virus and rinderpest virus, spread primarily by the trafficking of infected animals.

Capripox is a whole transboundary animal disease of its own, another pestilence of small stock.

[Indeed, the causative agent of PPR is, as stated further in the same posting, "a morbillivirus, closely related to the rinderpest virus." This moderator regrets the lapse and apologises for any inconvenience caused.

A similar correction has been received from Dr Orly Friedgut. We are grateful to all 3 for their alertness and help. - Mod.AS]
