A rare disease has been found on a popular banana variety in the Howard Springs rural area near Darwin [Northern Territory]. It is the 1st report of banana freckle disease on Cavendish bananas in Australia.

Banana freckle has been recorded previously [in Australia], but only on Lady Finger and Bluggoe (cooking) varieties of bananas in both the NT [Northern Territory] and North Queensland.

Affected properties have immediately been placed under quarantine in order to prevent further movement of the disease. Surveillance teams are currently visiting the area. There are no commercial banana farms near the affected properties.

[Banana freckle disease is caused by the fungus _Phyllosticta maculata_ (previously _Guignardia musae_). It affects leaves and fruit of _Musa_ species. Symptoms include dark spots resulting in a rough surface ('sandpaper feel'; due to protruding fungal structures), leaf streaking and yellowing, as well as loss of plant vigour. Severe infections may lead to wilting and death of plants. Fruit yield and quality can be reduced significantly.

The fungus is spread on individual plants by spores moving in water on the leaf or fruit surface, or within plantings by windblown water droplets over short distances. Long distance spread occurs mostly with infected plant material. Disease management may include fungicide and cultural techniques (such as bagging of fruit bunches).

Cavendish varieties include most of the commercial eating bananas. Until now, the Cavendish strain of the fungus had not been reported from mainland Australia, but was known to occur in several countries in South East Asia, including the Philippines and Taiwan, and suspected in other areas such as India and several islands of Indonesia. While only a small part of the national banana production comes from the NT, main commercial banana growing regions in Queensland are now at risk from a possible spread of the new strain. Furthermore, the origin of the infection is as yet unknown and this may represent a threat from additional quarantine incursions.
