No magic bullet for FMD prevention: Minister denies preventive killing
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Mr. Hirotaka Akamatsu, Minister of Agriculture, Forestry and
Fisheries stated Friday [14 May 2010] at a news conference after the
cabinet meeting that there is no magic bullet in preventing
foot-and-mouth disease [FMD], and reaffirmed his perception that the
thorough countermeasures taken at present such as disinfection and
destroying infected animals are important.

He carefully opposed the idea suggested by Mr. Hideo Higashikokubaru,
Governor of Miyazaki Prefecture of the preventive killing of all
livestock including healthy animals in the specific area in case of
worse epidemic, saying "I'm afraid it's unacceptable to kill healthy
livestock. We have to think carefully about infringing someone's
personal property." [See comment under item 2].

"When will it end?" - more than 80 000 killed in FMD epidemic
-------------------------------------------------------------
As of today, 86 farms had FMD cases and the total number of cattle
and pigs to be killed reached as many as 80 275. Mr. Akamatsu,
Minister of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries who visited Miyazaki
on 10 May 2010, emphasized that the national government will fully
cover the loss of livestock, but farmers and people involved remain
quite apprehensive about a spate of FMD cases.

"We have no hope. We can't go on any longer." The representative of
agricultural groups tearfully complained to Mr. Akamatsu about the
plight of livestock farmers. Mr. Hideo Higashikokubaru, Governor of
Miyazaki Prefecture repeatedly explained that the financial situation
of livestock farmers dropped drastically compared with the situation
10 years ago, and requested an all-round support from the Japanese Government.

There is no comparison between the epidemic we face today and the
outbreak 10 years ago where [a significantly smaller number of
animals were slaughtered]. "One of the causes of this widespread
damage is that the outbreak occurred in a area with overcrowding
livestock farms," the official of the prefecture pointed out.
According to the source, more than a half of pigs in Kawaminami-cho
which has the highest incidence of FMD cases has been decided to be
destroyed, and the number of cattle to be destroyed will also reach a
half of the town's herd. Japanese Self Defence Force is helping
burying carcasses, but only about a half of the total cases finished burial.

[The Japanese authorities, confronted by the need to cull exceedingly
growing numbers of infected, suspected or in-contact animals, may
have to consider the option of "vaccination in response to the
outbreak". This, apparently, was the step undertaken by Mongolia when
the initial outbreak of FMD serotype O was recently detected there
(see 20100506.1474). Genotyping of the Mongolian virus strain is not
yet available; information on the observed efficacy of the
vaccination, and details on the vaccine strain applied, will help.

One of the key messages of a recently drafted EU policy paper was:
"Vaccination and testing should replace unnecessary culling"; see
SANCO/7070/2010, May 2010 Policy paper "Vaccine and/or diagnostic
banks for major animal diseases: strategic planning options for
emergency situations or major crises", available at

[3] A full genome sequence

Foot & mouth disease - Far East (P.R. China [including Hong Kong
SAR], Republic of Korea and Japan)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The FAO/OIE Reference Laboratory for FMD at the Institute for Animal
Health (UK) have determined the full genome sequence for a
representative serotype O isolate recovered from the recent outbreaks
of FMD that have occurred in the Far East. Since February this year,
outbreaks due to the southeast Asia topotype (Mya-98 lineage) of
serotype O have been confirmed in PR China (including Hong Kong SAR),
Republic of Korea and Japan. VP1 sequence analysis undertaken at the
IAH shows that viruses from Japan, Republic of Korea and Hong Kong
SAR are closely related to each other (sharing nucleotide
identities >97 percent;
<http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/>).

A full genome sequence (8123 nucleotides) was generated from an
isolate obtained from a pig with epithelial lesions that was sampled
in Hong Kong SAR on 3 Mar 2010. This sequence (draft GenBank
submission) is attached to the end of this bulletin or can be found at
<http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/far_east_2010.htm>.
[Unfortunately, ProMED-mail is technically unable to include the full
genome sequence in this posting; subscribers are, therefore, referred
to the URL, kindly provided by the authors, where the draft sequence
can be downloaded. The URL includes also a short overview "FMD
Situation in the Far East - 2010". - Mod.AS]

During previous FMD outbreaks in the UK (2001 and 2007), full genome
sequence data has been used to reconstruct transmission pathways at
the farm-to-farm level: for examples see Cottam et al., 2006, and
Cottam et al., 2008. This approach could be used now to support
epidemiological investigations that are being conducted to understand
the regional and local spread of the virus in Asia.

This sequence can also be used to check the suitability of molecular
tests used for the diagnosis of FMD in the region.

Further information, including detailed laboratory RT-PCR protocols
used to generate this sequence, can be obtained from WRLFMD:
