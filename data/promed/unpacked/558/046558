Chipotle has shut down a restaurant in Sterling, VA, after multiple reports of customers getting sick after eating there. Customers reported symptoms such as vomiting, diarrhea, severe stomach pain, dehydration and nausea to the website https://iwaspoisoned.com/, which 1st alerted Business Insider to the issues at the Sterling restaurant. One person reported 2 hospitalizations as a result of the illnesses.

In total, 8 reports were made to the website, indicating that at least 13 customers fell sick after eating there from 14-15 Jul 2017. Chipotle told Business Insider that it is aware of the illnesses and has notified local health officials. "We are working with health authorities to understand what the cause may be and to resolve the situation as quickly as possible," Jim Marsden, Chipotle's executive director of food safety, said. "The reported symptoms are consistent with norovirus. Norovirus does not come from our food supply, and it is safe to eat at Chipotle."

He said the illnesses are isolated to the Sterling restaurant and that the company plans to reopen that location on [Tue 18 Jul 2017] after sanitizing it. Customers who fell sick after eating at the Sterling restaurant reported "vomiting violently," fevers, "violent stomach cramps," and dizziness for several days.

"[Fri 14 Jul 2017] Daughter and friends went to Chipotle," one customer wrote on https://iwaspoisoned.com/. By the next morning [Sat 15 Jul 2017] the daughter was "violently sick, puking, diarrhea, severe pain, overnight into [Sun 16 Jul 2017]. Friends ill as well with one friend also in ER." The daughter was hospitalized for dehydration, nausea, and pain and the next day was still in "severe pain," according to the customer. "This is the worst that I have ever seen," the customer wrote.

Norovirus is different from _E. coli_, the bacteria that led to a widespread outbreak at Chipotle restaurants in 14 states 2 years ago [2015]. The virus is highly contagious and causes symptoms like stomachaches, nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting. It's the most common cause of food-borne illnesses in the USA with more than 21 million cases annually. Cases of norovirus stemming from restaurants can often involve a worker who failed to wash his or her hands after going to the bathroom.

Chipotle has dealt with norovirus cases in the past. In December 2015, nearly 120 Boston College students fell sick after a norovirus outbreak at a restaurant close to campus

[Worldwide, norovirus is the leading cause of acute gastroenteritis (inflammation of the stomach or intestines or both). About one in 5 cases of acute gastroenteritis, which leads to diarrhea and vomiting, is caused by norovirus (http://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/worldwide.html). Norovirus is more often the cause of acute gastroenteritis among people in developed countries. In developed countries, norovirus causes about one in 5 cases of acute gastroenteritis; in developing countries, it's about one in 6 cases. Overall, developing countries have more cases of acute gastroenteritis caused by different pathogens, such as viruses and bacteria. So, norovirus accounts for smaller fraction of all cases in these countries.

With the widespread use of rotavirus vaccine, norovirus has surpassed rotavirus as the most common cause of acute gastroenteritis for which children need medical care in some countries, like the United States and Nicaragua. This trend is likely to continue as other countries routinely vaccinate against rotavirus.

Norovirus infections and outbreaks are usually more common in cooler, winter months. About half of all cases occur from December through February in countries above the equator and June through August in countries below the equator. However, in places closer to the equator, norovirus may be less seasonal. This may be because of temperature or the timing of the rainy season, but may also be associated with the birth rate. - Mod.LL
