In the ProMED posting cited above it is said:

Actually, at the case report level, blastomycosis has been transmitted from
dogs to humans via bite and via needle. These [prior events were cases of
inoculation blastomycosis, similar to what happens (rarely) when there is
an accident during autopsy of a patient with blastomycosis.
A few references for those interested in case reports of blastomycosis
transmission
from dogs to humans are:
