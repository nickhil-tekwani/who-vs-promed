We are experiencing several cases of _Escherichia coli_- related HUS [hemolytic uremic syndrome] linked to a single goat farm here in Connecticut. Two cases in children remain hospitalized with HUS; so far other cases have either recovered or are mild. Interestingly, the stool cultures that I have seen have been Shiga-toxin negative yet were identified as _E. coli_ O157 by culture. Our micro lab states that, in validation, their Shiga toxin assay correlated 100 per cent with culture, so we found this a bit unusual. Our state lab is working up the isolates for clonality. I am aware of several mild cases seen at our hospital in children who have visited the farm, so I anticipate further cases of gastroenteritis and possible HUS over the next week or 2.

[ProMED thanks Dr. Bennett for his firsthand information.

Not finding Shiga toxin in the stool of a patient with a classical illness and the isolation of serotype O157 in the stool is not common but could be explained in the following source: Lutwick LI. Enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ infections. In: Confronting emerging zoonoses: the one health paradigm. Yamada A, Kahn LH, Kaplan B, et al, editors. Springer, 2014, pp 77-112, at least with regard to O26, with the citations renumbered:

Shiga toxin-negative strains of EHEC O26 can be isolated from patients who have had HUS (1). During the course of HUS, a subset of EHEC may suffer excision of the toxin-converted phage. This particular O26:H11 Stx2a clone, which is sometimes H-, has become more prevalent in Europe and is linked to a higher risk of HUS. It is postulated by Bielaszewska (2) that loss of the STx phage can increase adaptability in the human gut, increasing in the number of organisms and then requiring the STx gene to emerge highly virulent. Isolates losing the STx prophase have been designated EHEC-LST (EHEC-Lost Shiga Toxin (3).

The goat farm in Lebanon that may potentially be linked to an _E. coli_ outbreak has been given 2 stipulations by the health department, the owner told NBC Connecticut. Oak Leaf Dairy Farm is no longer allowed to have the public visit its goats and may not distribute unpasteurized products, Mark Reynolds, the farm's owner, said. Reynolds said that the outbreak has already started affecting his wholesale business. He said he had never had _E. coli_ linked to his farm before.

The Department of Health and other agencies began to investigate Oak Leaf Dairy Farm after 7 people contracted _E. coli_ [infection]. Six of those people were children who visited the farm and petted the goats. Connecticut Children's Medical Center said 2 patients have been diagnosed with hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), which attacks the body's kidneys and is associated with the _E. coli_ infection.

The DPH agency said they are bringing experts from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta to help investigate the outbreak. The DPH is asking anyone who visited Oak Leaf Dairy to contact them.
