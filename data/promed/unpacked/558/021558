Kenya: NASA Gave Warning Over Deadly Fever
-----------------------------------------------
The deaths from Rift Valley fever (RVF) could have been avoided if
Kenya had heeded a warning by an American body that changing climatic
conditions posed a risk.
The UN Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) says the US-based
National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Goddard Space
Flight center sounded the alarm way back in September [2006], 2
months before the 1st case was reported in Garissa.
However, it is not clear whether the country received the warning or
simply ignored it.
Since November [2006], more than 47 human deaths have been reported
in North Eastern Province.
The center had warned that rising temperatures accompanied by heavy
rains in the Central and Eastern Pacific Ocean and Western Indian
Ocean could spark an outbreak of the disease.
The warning was contained in FAO's September [2006] edition of the
Emergency Prevention Systems Magazine, Empress Watch. The center had
been monitoring climate in East Africa for several years.
"The heavy rains being experienced were similar to what was observed
in 1997/1998, when a major outbreak occurred in Tanzania, Somalia and
Kenya," read the warning.
"The outbreak of Rift Valley Fever is another example that requires a
quick and coordinated response," said FAO's New Crisis Management
Centre manager, Karin Schwabenbauer.

[The above newswire was circulated internally at ProMED-mail with the
following question posed by Mod.MPP: "What would/could they have done
to prevent the outbreak?" The response of our moderators definitely
warrants sharing with the general ProMED-mail community. - Mod.MPP]
[What, indeed could they have done? There is no commercial human RVF
vaccine available. The virus is in _Aedes_ eggs deposited in "dambos"
(periodically flooded wet areas), and when they hatch and adults
emerge, they come equipped with virus ready for transmission. _Aedes_
vector control in this large an area seems impractical and expensive.
Moving people and their small ruminant animal RFV hosts out of areas
of potential or active transmission also seems impractical,
especially along the Kenya-Somalia border given what has been going
on there over the past several days. The only feasible alternatives
that occur to me are: (1) vaccinating livestock as WHO proposes, (2)
educating people not to handle or butcher infected animals, to
minimize animal-to-human (non-vector) transmission, and even that
would be daunting with people spread over a large area of difficult
access, and (3) giving health care providers time to get ready to
attend the human cases that would result from an outbreak. - Mod.TY]
[A comment on some aspects of RVF in Kenya as posted in ProMED
archive 20070106.0058 and our internal discussions:
As regards vector transmission, at least 30 species of mosquitoes
have been found naturally infected with the virus of RVF. Although it
is stated that _Aedes_ species are the main vectors, considerable
transmission can be due to _Culex_ and _Mansonia_ species. In Kenya,
species found naturally infected include _Aedes dalzei_, _Ae.
durbanensis_, _Ae. lineatopennis_, _Culex antennatus_, _Cx.
simpsoni_, _Cx. vansomereni_, _Cx. zombaensis_, _Cx rubinotus_ and
_Anopheles christyi_ and _An. pharoensis_. Note the large numbers of
_Culex_ species.
In addition, the tick _Rhipicephalus appendiculatus_ was reported as
a vector in Kenya in 1933. In Nigeria (1967) _Culicoides_ species
were reported positive for the virus as were _Simulium_ species in
South Africa in 1953. However, whether these non-mosquito vectors are
important epidemiologically is questionable. I would guess not.
Whereas the eggs of _Aedes_ mosquitoes can tolerate desiccation for
months and even years, species of _Culex_ and other genera cannot.
Transovarial transmission was shown in _Ae. lineatopennis_ in Kenya
and in _Ae. vexans_ in Senegal, but most likely occurs in other
aedine species. It has been suggested that such transmission
maintains the virus in nature during inter-epidemic periods.
Recent epidemics in Kenya have shown the importance not only of
rainfall but also of crop irrigation practices.
If logistics and finances allow, then ultra-low-volume (ULV) aerial
applications of insecticides are the most appropriate method for
curtailing epidemics; or on a smaller scale, ground-based spraying
can be used. Commonly used insecticides include organophosphates,
such as malathion and pirimiphos-methyl, or pyrethroids, like
permethrin and deltamethrin, to kill the adults.
Insecticide-impregnated nets, which can remain effective for many
months or even years depending on the method of treating the nets
with pyrethroid insecticides, will only be effective at night, when
people are sleeping under them. Many of the potential RVF vectors
(e.g. most _Aedes_ species) bite during the daytime, not at night,
although in general, _Culex_, _Mansonia_ and _Anopheles_ species bite at night.
Indoor residual spraying, whether in human or animal quarters, will
only be effective if the vectors enter such quarters to feed and or
rest, and most potential vectors do not. By the way, one hopes that
Kenya will soon reintroduce DDT spraying of houses for malaria
control, as have at least 8 other African countries.
What is meant by larviciding stagnant pools? Many, if not most, RVF
vectors will not breed in stagnant waters but in relatively clean
aquatic habitats. Moreover, larviciding needs precise identification
of the aquatic habitats colonized by vector mosquitoes, which,
combined with the often extensive nature of such habitats, means that
larviciding is not likely to be very effective. Moreover, when
desiccated eggs are flooded, not all will hatch; it may take several
repeated flooding and drying periods to stimulate hatching.
Larviciding will kill only the larvae, not any un-hatched eggs. - Mod.MS]
[A live vaccine prepared from Smithburn's attenuated strain of RVF
virus has been used for the control of RVF in non-pregnant cattle and
sheep in endemic areas and during outbreaks, while inactivated
vaccines for use in pregnant animals and in RVF-free countries are
prepared from virulent field strains. RVF vaccines have been
extensively applied in RVF-infected countries, such as South Africa
(where both live and inactivated vaccines are commercially produced),
Zimbabwe, Kenya, Egypt and Saudi Arabia. For example, Egypt's annual
mass vaccination during 2004 included more than 7 million
vaccinations, of which 1 986 825 were in cattle, 1 259 195 in
buffaloes, 3 170 183 in sheep, 935 128 in goats and 95 308 in camels.
Both attenuated and killed vaccines are applied. Egypt's last RVF
outbreak was reported in July 2003.
Israel, an RVF-free country, carried out preventive vaccination
against RVF during the years 1979 -1981 in the face of the RVF
panzootic in neighboring Egypt. The entire country's ruminant
population and camels were vaccinated with a commercial inactivated
vaccine and earmarked; the country remained free of disease. No
vaccinations have been carried out since.
According to OIE's manual of Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines for
Terrestrial Animals, an inactivated experimental RVF vaccine has been
used for 25 years in humans with considerable success to protect
persons at risk. This vaccine is currently produced on diploid cells.
However, the limited availability of the vaccine precludes its use in
the general population.
Two new vaccine candidates produced from human RVF virus isolates are
undergoing extensive testing with a view to replacing existing animal
vaccines. The 1st, MV P12, is a mutagen-derived strain of virus found
protective in young lambs and in cattle, but its safety for pregnant
animals is still under investigation. The 2nd candidate is Clone 13,
a small plaque variant that did not react with 2 specific monoclonal
antibodies and which has undergone testing in lambs, sheep and young
and adult goats with promising results.
Further information, including description of live and inactivated
vaccine production and testing and data on the above mentioned
experimental vaccines, is available in chapter 2.1.8 of OIE's Manual
of Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines for Terrestrial Animals (available on-line at
<http://oie.int/eng/normes/mmanual/A_00031.htm>).
