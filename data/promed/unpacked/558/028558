Health officials are reporting the Navajo Nation's 1st case this year [2021] of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, a rare but potentially fatal disease spread by infected rodent droppings.

The tribal health department said the case was confirmed in McKinley County in northwestern New Mexico, but it wasn't known how the person contracted hantavirus.

Hantavirus typically is reported in spring and summer, often due to exposures that occur when people are near mouse droppings in homes, sheds, or poorly ventilated areas.

Recommended precautions to limit the spread of hantavirus include ventilating and cleaning areas where there might be mouse droppings.

[This case occurred on the New Mexico part of the Navajo Nation Reservation, the locality where the 1st diagnosed cases of Sin Nombre hantavirus infection occurred in 1993. The hantavirus involved in the case above doubtless is Sin Nombre virus as well. Sin Nombre hantavirus is endemic in New Mexico, and a few cases have occurred there annually in recent years except for 2018 and 2020. Infected rodents shed the virus in feces, urine, and saliva. Individuals opening up cabins or storage areas that have been closed over winter or cleaning areas with signs of rodent presence should heed the precautions that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provides, with more detail than in the above report, in order to avoid exposure to the virus (https://www.cdc.gov/rodents/cleaning/index.html).

The CDC advice includes the following:
"1st, clean up any urine and droppings.
- When you begin cleaning, it is important that you do not stir up dust by sweeping or vacuuming up droppings, urine, or nesting materials.
- Wear rubber, latex, or vinyl gloves when cleaning urine and droppings.
- Spray the urine and droppings with a disinfectant or a mixture of bleach and water and let soak 5 minutes. The recommended concentration of bleach solution is 1 part bleach to 10 parts water. When using a commercial disinfectant, follow the manufacturer's instructions on the label for dilution and disinfection time.
- Use a paper towel to pick up the urine and droppings, and dispose of the waste in the garbage.
- After the rodent droppings and urine have been removed, disinfect items that might have been contaminated by rodents or their urine and droppings.

Next, clean and disinfect the whole area.
- Mop floors and clean countertops with disinfectant or bleach solution.
- Steam clean or shampoo upholstered furniture and carpets with evidence of rodent exposure.
- Wash any bedding and clothing with laundry detergent in hot water if exposed to rodent urine or droppings.
- Lastly, remove gloves, and thoroughly wash hands with soap and water (or use a waterless alcohol-based hand rub when soap is not available and hands are not visibly soiled)."

Hantavirus cardiopulmonary disease (HPS) is a serious disease that can become life threatening very quickly. Individuals who develop febrile disease with pulmonary symptoms should seek medical attention immediately.

Deer mice, _Peromyscus maniculatus_, are the reservoir hosts of the Sin Nombre virus. An image of the deer mouse, _P. maniculatus_, can be seen at http://www.nsf.gov/news/mmg/media/images/mouse_f.jpg. - Mod.TY
