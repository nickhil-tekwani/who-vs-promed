See also: 14 and 28 Sep 2001
Reported on 22 November 2001 by Dr Shigeo Miyajima, director of Animal
Health Division, Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, Tokyo.
One outbreak, at Soya Gun, Hokkaido Prefecture, was confirmed by laboratory
diagnosis on 21 Nov 2001. A Holstein cow aged 5 years and 7 months that had
been kept on a dairy farm was slaughtered at the abattoir on 19 Nov 2001.
Total number of animals in the outbreak:
species / susceptible / cases / deaths / destroyed / slaughtered
bov / 79 / 1 / 0 / 0 / 2
The brain sample from the cow tested positive to the enzyme linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) based BSE screening test required by the
Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare for all cattle slaughtered at
abattoirs since 18 October and carried out at Ubushi Substation, Teshio
Branch, Rumoi Public Health Center (Teshio Gun, Hokkaido Prefecture). The
brain sample was sent to the Obihiro University of Agriculture and
Veterinary Medicine (Hokkaido Prefecture) for confirmation and was
subjected to Western blot analysis with a positive result on 21 Nov 2001.
The source of agent/origin of infection is under investigation.
Control measures are as follows:
- the dairy farm where the BSE case was found has been placed under
movement control by Soya Livestock Hygiene Service Center.
- identification of all animals that were kept with the infected cow.
- epidemiological investigation of the feed used on the farm, as a possible
source of infection.
