The spectre of a failed jute crop haunts thousands of farmers in the
coastal districts after a killer virus wreaked havoc on the hundreds of
acres of jute fields. Hoping against hope, jute farmer Narasingh Swain of
Bharatapur village tried his luck with the crop even after 2 successive
years of disaster. From May [2007], when the jute crop is sown, to June
[2007], Narasingh and nearly 30 000 jute growers of Kendrapara and
Jagasinghpur [state of Orissa] were happy that they had taken the right
decision. In July [2007], the dice suddenly rolled the wrong way.
Many jute growers are now facing a bleak future following an attack by a
deadly virus -- bud necrosis. The virus is spreading fast and eating away
growing jute crops, said Gayadhar Dhal, secretary of District Jute farmers'
Association. The farmers of Kendrapara district raised jute on about 25 000
acres [about 10 100 hectares]. Non-availability of water in the canals and
scanty rainfall in July [2007] are the main reasons behind the virus attack.
The district has jute-receiving centres at Danpur, Karilopatna,
Pattamundai, Marsaghai, Rajkanika, and Derabishi. A large number of farmers
had obtained advance money from the jute merchants of all the 6 centres.
After the news spread about crop loss, the jute merchants have been
spending sleepless nights. Ramesh Agrawalla, a jute merchant who had
provided at least Rs 5 lakh (about USD 12 300) to jute growers, is a
dejected man.
Sundry cooperative societies also provided financial help to many jute
growers. "Now it will be difficult to recover the amount," said Rajkishora
Sahoo, secretary of Maa Sarala Cooperative Society, Rajkanika. On Monday
[30 Jul 2007], hundreds of farmers demanded financial aid like crop
insurance cover and pesticides free from the district administration.
Collector Kashinath Sahoo said the district agriculture officer had been
directed to conduct an inquiry into the crop loss.

[Although it is not dealing with a food crop, this item has been included
because jute provides food security to these resource-poor farmers as a
vital cash crop. There are 2 commercially important species, _Corchorus
capsularis_ (white jute) and _C. olitorius_ (tossa jute). Jute grows under
a wide variation of climatic conditions and stress in the tropics and
subtropics, and it is a most important traditional cash crop in parts of
Asia and Africa.
A number of insect pests and fungal diseases can affect jute. Viruses known
to affect the genus _Corchorus_ include _Cacao swollen shoot virus_ (genus
_Badnavirus_), _Cotton leaf curl virus_ (_Bigeminivirus_), _Okra mosaic
virus_ (_Tymovirus_), _Corchorus yellow spot virus_ (_Begomovirus_),
_Corchorus golden mosaic virus_ (_Begomovirus_), and _Corchorus yellow vein
virus_ (_Begomovirus_). Several of these viruses are insect transmitted.
On the other hand, 2 viruses known to cause bud necrosis symptoms in their
hosts are _Watermelon bud necrosis virus_ (tentative member of genus
_Tospovirus_) and _ Groundnut bud necrosis virus_ (_Tospovirus_). No
information could be found on whether these can affect jute, but many
tospoviruses have a wide host range. Tospoviruses are spread by insects
(thrips) and many new species are being discovered, especially in tropical
areas (for more information on tospoviruses see ProMED-mail post no.
20070524.1670).
From the information in this news report it cannot be decided whether any
of these viruses causes the devastation or whether a new virus may possibly
be involved. It is also not clear why lack of water should have contributed
to the viral epidemic, other than that perhaps a general drought would put
more insect pressure on fewer available host plants and possibly lead to
more viral infections carried by these insects.
