[1] Cholera - Mexico (Hidalgo State)

After 6 months, cholera reappeared in Hidalgo [State], because in the last week [week ending 6 Jul 2014] there were 3 new cases, which were reported in La Huasteca [see comment], according to the latest report of the federal Secretariat of Health (SSH). The 3 cases are 2 men and a woman, who have been kept under observation and are in treatment.

Cholera, caused by the bacterium _Vibrio cholerae_, is a contagious disease characterized by vomiting and diarrhea, causing dehydration, and can be fatal.

The SSH reported that, unlike in 2013, this time there is more awareness among the people regarding transmission of the infection.

[2] Cholera - Mexico (Veracruz State)

Two cases of cholera have been confirmed by Sanitary District number 5 in the community of El Castillo [Veracruz State], said its municipal agent, Juan Gabriel Hernandez Baizabal. The patients are a young man of 32 years and one of his sons aged 5. The sick people live with their family, but to date there have been no other cases in the family.

In March 2012, the inhabitants were alarmed by an alleged cholera outbreak that was discarded by the health authorities. In 2013, there were also suspected cases, which forced the health authorities to carry out studies in springs and other sources of water without releasing the results, according to Hernandez Baizabal.

Tests are currently taking place with the support of the Directorate of Environmental Health, and are expected to be available no later than next week [week of 7 Jul 2014]. The tests include the physico-chemical and bacteriological analysis of the springs to see if the cholera cases come from some contamination of the water.

In a recently released report (MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep 2014; 63(25); 552-3 http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6325a5.htm?s_cid=mm6325a5_w) during 19 Sep 2013-15 Dec 2013, a total of 175 cases of cholera were confirmed in La Huasteca (159 in Hidalgo, 14 in Veracruz, and 2 in San Luis Potosi).

La Huasteca (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Huasteca) is a geographical and cultural region located in Mexico along the Gulf of Mexico that includes parts of the states of Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Puebla, Hidalgo, San Luis Potosi, Queretaro, and Guanajuato. It is roughly defined as the area in which the Huastec people had influence when their civilization was at its height in the Mesoamerican period. Today, the Huastecs occupy only a fraction of this region, with the Nahua people now the most numerous indigenous group. - Mod.LL
