[There is a correction of this report: Caprine arthritis/encephalitis - Romania: comment correction, not Switzerland 20201112.7937912.
In the moderator's comment below, the information from https://www.merckvetmanual.com/generalized-conditions/caprine-arthritis-and-encephalitis/overview-of-caprine-arthritis-and-encephalitis indicates that seroprevalence of caprine arthritis/encephalitis (CAE) virus is over 65 percent in some countries, including Switzerland. This is incorrect. The Swiss goat population has been considered free of CAE since the end of 2018. ProMED regrets any confusion or inconvenience that this post may have generated. - Mod.CRD]

["Caprine arthritis and encephalitis (CAE) virus infection is manifested clinically as polysynovitis-arthritis in adult goats and less commonly as progressive paresis (leukoencephalomyelitis) in kids. Subclinical or clinical interstitial pneumonia, indurative mastitis ("hard udder"), and chronic wasting have also been attributed to infection with this virus. Most CAE virus infections, however, are subclinical. Infection with the CAE virus decreases the lifetime productivity of dairy goats and is a barrier to exportation of goats from North America.

CAE virus infection is widespread among dairy goats in most industrialized countries but rare among indigenous goat breeds of developing countries unless they have been in contact with imported goats. In countries such as Canada, Norway, Switzerland, France, and the USA, seroprevalence of CAE virus is over 65 percent."
