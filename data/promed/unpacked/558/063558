The number of animals and locations affected by anthrax in the
northeast part of Saskatchewan's farmland continues to grow. As of
Thursday [27 Jul 2006] morning, 324 animals have died from anthrax,
and 71 premises have tested positive for anthrax, said Dr. Sandra
Stephens, disease control specialist with the Canadian Food Inspection Agency.
20 rural municipalities in Saskatchewan have a site with anthrax, she
said. Animals involved include cattle, horses, swine, bison,
whitetail deer, sheep and goats.

[The presence of isolated outbreaks in Chaplin, Foam Lake and
Insinger raises the probability that increased awareness in the
province of this disease has also increased the number of random
deaths that are being examined, thus finding anthrax outbreaks that
would not have otherwise been observed and recorded. This brings me
back to a personal conviction that this disease is maintained not by
the big epidemics, during which proper control procedures are usually
carried out, but by the pitter-patter of unseen cases in the
intervening years, which thereby maintain soil contamination. Also,
in general, if farmers cannot afford veterinary support, they can be
unaware of what has been killing their stock, therefore not asking
for nor applying appropriate vaccines in the spring round-up.
As ever, many thanks to Sandra Stephenson for her excellent work in
keeping us and others informed as to what is happening. - Mod.MHJ]
