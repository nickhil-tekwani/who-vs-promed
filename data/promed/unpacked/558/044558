A woman said she was walking her dog along Arizona Street, between Dwight Street and Myrtle Avenue, when they came across what looked like balls of meat laced with a green substance. The dog appeared to have eaten some, and the animal was taken to the vet to be examined.

L.O., who runs Lionel's Legacy Senior Dog, told 10 News that the dog is one of their rescue dogs that has been under the care of a foster family in North Park for the past 3 weeks.

"Our foster did gather some of the material and took it to the vet, and our vet did believe it was consistent with rat poisoning," L.O. said.

It's unclear how much of the substance the dog ate, or if any. So far, the 12-year-old lab is not showing any signs of sickness, but she will be back with doctors this week.

"This issue extends beyond being a danger just to dogs. We are also concerned about children and wildlife in the community who could be put at risk by something like this. We will be collaborating with our law enforcement partners in this investigation," said the San Diego Humane Society chief of humane law enforcement Steve MacKinnon.

The San Diego Humane Society is looking into the matter and asked anyone with information to contact them at 1-619-299-7012.

[It is sad and unfortunate some individuals lace tasty treats with toxins. The individual may have been trying to bait stray cats or dogs or even rodents. Or it may well have been intended to inflict pain on owned animals and their owners.

We like to believe our communities are safe, but unfortunately it is not always the case. Thankfully the individual took the bait and the animal to the veterinarian. Hopefully the veterinarian induced vomiting and also sent the vomit and the bait to a diagnostic lab to identify the suspicious substance.

Green bait may be one of a variety of rodenticides. Some, such as bromethalin, have almost no treatment, whereas others, such as the anticoagulant rodent baits produce at toxicosis, are more capable of being treated. So it is important to know which specific toxin the dog may have ingested to understand what the true prognosis may be. Another green substance may be strychnine. This produces convulsions and is very difficult to treat.

We certainly hope the dog is doing well. - Mod.TG
