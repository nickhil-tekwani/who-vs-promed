Personal communication with Dr Marasini in the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division (EDCD) of the Ministry of Health indicates that 15 persons in Batase village of Sindhupalchok are being treated for typhoid fever, and one or 2 of them have been confirmed to have the disease based on blood culture results.

This is the main season in Nepal for enterically transmitted infections like diarrhea, typhoid and hepatitis. There have been no reports of cholera so far.

Travelers who are volunteering for relief work in Nepal have also been seen in good numbers with diarrheal disease, and we have seen 2 cases of typhoid fever so far at the CIWEC Clinic.

With the onset of monsoon, cases of typhoid fever, the most common communicable disease in the country, have been reported in various earthquake-affected districts. The Epidemiology and Diseases Control Division (EDCD) under the Ministry of Health reported fresh cases of typhoid in Batase VDC of Sindhupalchok [Bagmati Zone, Central Region], one of the severely quake-affected districts, this week [week of 20 Jul 2015].

"A few cases diagnosed as typhoid fever are reported from Sindhupalchok. Locals have been found drinking polluted river water, and personal hygiene conditions are found poor," said Baburam Marasini, director of EDCD. The division has already mobilized a medical team, and patients are under treatment, he added. Typhoid patients need medication for 14 days. According to EDCD, sporadic cases of typhoid and diarrhea are found in other earthquake-affected districts as well. "Safe drinking water, safe food, and adequate facilities for personal hygiene are necessary in vulnerable areas," Marasini said.

Considering the risks of epidemic outbreaks and cases of communicable diseases, especially in earthquake-affected districts, the government body is promoting healthy behavior among locals through various messages. "The availability of drugs and medical teams are ready to be mobilised if required in affected areas in the coming days," according to EDCD officials.

Normally, during the summer monsoon between June and September, cases of water-induced and communicable diseases are reported from remote districts as well as urban areas in the country. Contaminated water sources, poor personal and community hygiene and unsafe food, among others, are considered major causes.

[With the onset of the rainy season, it is not surprising that waterborne diseases, such as typhoid fever, would become more prominent. Other diseases that may also increase are cholera, shigellosis, and amoebiasis. - Mod.LL]
