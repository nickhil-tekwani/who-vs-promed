[2] Vector control, France

----------------------------------------------------------------------
We aimed to identify the optimal strategy that should be used by public health authorities against transmission of chikungunya virus in mainland France. The theoretical model we developed, which mimics the current surveillance system, predicted that without vector control (VC), the probability of local transmission after introduction of viraemic patients was around 2 percent, and the number of autochthonous cases between 5-15 persons per hectare [2.47 acres], depending on the number of imported cases. Compared with this baseline, we considered different strategies (VC after clinical suspicion of a case or after laboratory confirmation, for imported or autochthonous cases): Awaiting laboratory confirmation for suspected imported cases to implement VC had no significant impact on the epidemiological outcomes analysed, mainly because of the delay before entering into the surveillance system. However, waiting for laboratory confirmation of autochthonous cases before implementing VC resulted in more frequent outbreaks. After analysing the economic cost of such strategies, our study suggested implementing VC immediately after the notification of a suspected autochthonous case as the most efficient strategy in settings where local transmission has been proven. Nevertheless, we identified that decreasing reporting time for imported cases should remain a priority.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary
Conventional vector control approaches often fail to result in effective and sustainable prevention of infection with viruses transmitted by _Aedes_ mosquitoes. CDC developed an Autocidal Gravid Ovitrap (AGO) to attract and capture the female _A. aegypti_ mosquitoes responsible for transmission of infectious agents to humans. Since 2012, 4 communities in 2 municipalities in southern Puerto Rico, Salinas, and Guayama, have participated in an ongoing field trial of AGO traps to control _A. aegypti_ mosquitoes. According to preliminary findings, lower incidence of chikungunya virus infection in the intervention compared with nonintervention communities occurred in the context of 10-fold lower mosquito densities in the intervention areas with AGO traps.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Chikungunya fever is an acute febrile illness caused by the chikungunya virus (CHIKV), which is transmitted to humans by _Aedes_ mosquitoes. Although chikungunya fever is rarely fatal, patients can experience debilitating symptoms that last from months to years. Here we comprehensively assess the global distribution of chikungunya and produce high-resolution maps, using an established modelling framework that combines a comprehensive occurrence database with bespoke environmental correlates, including up-to-date _Aedes_ distribution maps. This enables estimation of the current total population-at-risk of CHIKV transmission and identification of areas where the virus may spread to in the future. We identified 94 countries with good evidence for current CHIKV presence and a set of countries in the New and Old World with potential for future CHIKV establishment, demonstrated by high environmental suitability for transmission and in some cases previous sporadic reports. _A. aegypti_ presence was identified as one of the major contributing factors to CHIKV transmission but significant geographical heterogeneity exists. We estimated 1.3 billion people are living in areas at-risk of CHIKV transmission. These maps provide a baseline for identifying areas where prevention and control efforts should be prioritised and can be used to guide estimation of the global burden of CHIKV.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary
Chikungunya fever, a viral disease epidemic in some parts of the world is newly introduced in the Americas. This is of considerable international concern, with a growing incidence owing to developing urbanization, tourism, and trade. Ocular manifestations of chikungunya fever are not frequent, but of great relevance. Common manifestations include conjunctivitis, optic neuritis, iridocyclitis, episcleritis, retinitis, and uveitis. Diagnostic and monitoring investigations would include optical coherence tomography, fundus fluorescein, and indocyanine green angiography, visual field analysis, and electrophysiologic tests. There have been no prospective, randomized therapeutic trials, and it is unclear if the disease is self-limiting or if treatment is actually beneficial. Prognosis varies, ranging from full resolution to permanent vision loss despite intervention.
