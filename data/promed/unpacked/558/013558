7 Countries Have Confirmed Cases of Swine Flu
---------------------------------------------
A total of 2 new swine flu cases were confirmed in Israel and as many
as 11 in New Zealand, bringing the number of countries with confirmed
cases to at least 7 on Tuesday [29 Apr 2009]. But all, with the
exception of Mexico, said the patients were recovering or had been
hospitalized with only mild symptoms, leaving health officials
struggling to determine why the disease has killed only in Mexico.

In Mexico, 20 fatalities have been confirmed, and the number of
deaths considered likely to have been caused by the flu rose to 152,
up from 149 on Monday [28 Apr 2009], according to Mexico's health
minister. The number of people believed to be infected surpassed 1600.

In the United States, the number of infections stood at 50.
Preliminary tests by health officials in New Jersey had identified 5
"probable" cases -- 4 people who were recently in Mexico and one who
had been in California, the Associated Press reported. Other cases
have been reported in Ohio, Kansas, Texas and California. Most of the
cases were concentrated in New York, at a high school in Queens where
a group of students had recently traveled to Mexico. At least 28
students at the school tested positive, and another 17 were suspected
of having the flu, with testing underway. Investigators were also
examining between 10 and 15 possible new cases in 3 counties in
upstate New York, all involving people who had recently traveled to
Mexico or the southwest United States. "All of our cases continue to
be mild, with spontaneous recovery," said Richard F. Daines, the New
York state health commissioner.

In Mexico, state health authorities looking for the initial source of
the outbreak toured a million-pig hog farm in Perote, in Veracruz
State. The plant is half-owned by Smithfield Foods, an American
company and the world's largest pork producer. Mexico's 1st known
swine flu case, which was later confirmed, was from Perote, according
to Health Minister Jose Angel Cordova. The case involved a 5-year-old
boy who recovered. But a spokesman for the plant said the boy was not
related to a plant worker and that none of its workers were sick. On
Tuesday, company officials allowed a reporter to tour their
facilities after showering and donning a mask and sanitized clothing.
About 15 000 pigs could be seen in various enclosures, and officials
said that at least 3 pig carcasses were on the farm. But they said
the pigs had not died of influenza and insisted there had been no
spike in deaths. "We're just as worried about this as everyone else,"
said Mike Hawn, a Smithfield spokesman.

In Europe, Spanish Health Minister Trinidad Jimenez on Tuesday said
Spain had confirmed a 2nd case of swine flu, in the eastern province
of Valencia, but that the patient was recovering well.

Israel's Ministry of Health on Tuesday reported the 1st case in the
country. Smadar Shazo, a Health Ministry spokeswoman, said the man
who contracted the illness, a 26-year-old, had recently returned from
Mexico. Ms. Shazo said he is in good health now and is likely to be
released from hospital Wednesday [29 Apr 2009]. The Health Ministry
later reported that a 2nd man had contracted the flu as well, but his
condition was unclear.

Hospital authorities in Scotland said 2 people -- the 1st known cases
of the virus in Britain -- were recovering after contracting the flu
while on honeymoon in Cancun, Mexico.

Officials in Canada said in a statement that 2 new cases had been
diagnosed in Alberta as well -- one in Calgary, and another in a
northern community -- bringing the number of confirmed cases in
Canada to 8. Both patients are men who traveled recently to Mexico,
and both had only mild symptoms, said Dr. Andre Corriveau, Alberta's
chief medical officer of health.

Given extensive human-to-human transmission, the World Health
Organization (WHO) raised its global pandemic flu alert level on
Monday [27 Apr 2009], but it recommended that borders not be closed
nor travel bans imposed, noting that that the virus had already
spread and that infected travelers might not show any symptoms.

However, many countries are tightening border and immigration
controls, and on Tuesday Britain advised against any nonessential
travel to Mexico. Japan announced that it would no longer allow
Mexican travelers to obtain visas upon arrival. The United States,
France and Germany have also warned against nonessential travel to
Mexico. Canada had done the same, a decision that appeared to
contradict the country's campaign for international coordination of
health-related travel advisories.

During the SARS outbreak in 2003, recommendations against visiting
Canada severely impaired the country's tourism industry. Canada said
then that that warnings were unnecessary and has since promoted the
idea that the WHO should be the body which issues them.

Another 10 countries are investigating possible cases, including
China and Russia, which were set to quarantine passengers suspected
of having the flu. At least 9 countries in Asia were checking air
passengers arriving from North America, and China was tightening
land border checks as well. Hong Kong, Taiwan and Russia were set to
quarantine passengers suspected of having the flu.

On Monday, Indonesia banned all pork products coming from Canada, the
United States and Mexico, and said it would destroy any pork products
imported before the ban. International health experts said the flu
cannot be transmitted from pigs or from eating properly handled pork.

The increase of the WHO alert to level 4 from level 3 means that
there has been sustained human-to-human transmission. The change
"indicates that the likelihood of a pandemic has increased, but not
that a pandemic is inevitable," Dr. Margaret Chan, the WHO director
general, said Monday.

The WHO also recommended that vaccine makers keep making the seasonal
flu vaccine instead of switching over to a new one that matches the
swine flu strain, but it urged them to start the process of picking a
pandemic strain, weakening it and making large batches of it, which
could take 6 months.

American officials said their response to the epidemic was already
aggressive, and the WHO's decision to raise its pandemic alert to
level 4 from level 3 would not change their plans. The WHO decision
offered some official guidance to a world that, at least for the day,
seemed swept by confusion that unnerved international travelers and
the financial markets. European and Asian markets fell, and stock in
airlines and the travel industry fell while those in pharmaceutical
companies rose. Pharmacies in New York reported runs on Tamiflu, an
anti-flu drug -- something that public health officials badly want to
avoid because the drug could eventually be needed for the truly ill.
For now supplies of Tamiflu and Relenza, another anti-flu drug,
remain adequate, the manufacturers said, but both were increasing
production and expressed anxiety that shortages could develop if
governments placed huge orders.

Confirmation of news cases is slow because most nations' laboratories
lack the test kit the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) in Atlanta, Georgia, is developing for the new virus. The CDC
began sending out the new kits on Monday, meaning that soon some
states and foreign countries would be able to make their own
diagnoses -- a development that could lead to a sharp increase in
confirmed cases.

[The production and distribution of diagnostic reagents and protocols
from the CDC will accelerate the diagnosis of cases and facilitate
more accurate monitoring of the spread in infection.

In addition to the cases listed above there are reports of suspected
cases in numerous countries (see below). - Mod.CP]
