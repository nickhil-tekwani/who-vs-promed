A parasite is wiping out rainbow trout in Colorado, Montana, Wyoming and
Idaho. The parasite is carried by a worm and causes whirling disease, which
makes fingerling trout spin in circles until they die. Over the past few
years, the disease has infected a number of prize rainbow trout streams in
the West, including the Madison, the Yellowstone, the South Platte and even
the Blackfoot, which was celebrated in the book and the movie "A River Runs
Through It."
German brown, cutthroat, brook and lake trout are less susceptible to the
disease and are replacing the rainbow trout in many rivers. As a result,
some sportsmen say the disease hasn't really hurt trout fishing so much as
forced them to adapt their flies and their fishing times to catch different
species. However, many fishermen prefer rainbow trout because they're more
spectacular to catch. The rainbow is more active than other trout, and thus
more fun to fight. It is also more colorful, with its speckled hues
shimmering in the sun as it leaps. Many fishermen say it tastes better than
other trout.
Dick Greene, co-owner and guide at Bud Lilly's Trout Shop in West
Yellowstone, Montana, said sport fishing on the Madison dropped off more
than 10 percent four years ago when the disease first hit the stream, but
bounced back when the rainbow trout inexplicably began to return.
Biologists warn they have no cure and very little to offer in the way of
hope. Only one drug, fumagillin, has shown any promise, and it's impossible
to get enough of it into an infected river to do any good. The biologists
say the best solution is to cleanse and modernize hatcheries.
They say fishermen can prevent the spread of the parasite by cleaning all
equipment with chlorine after fishing in diseased waters, washing debris
from boats and not throwing fish remains into the water. "I don't know if
we'll ever be able to eradicate it. The best we can do is learn to control
it," said Ken Peters, a biologist for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in
Bozeman, Mont. Some say the disease runs in cycles, and rivers can recover
on their own. They point to the Madison as a river that has bounced back.
The disease is harmless to humans; it is one of many parasites that are
routinely consumed. The parasite was brought into the United States around
1950 in fish from Europe. It worked its way from the East to the West as
fishermen stocked streams with their favorite sport fish. Eventually, the
parasite got into hatcheries that are used to stock trout streams. Colorado
officials said 12 of 15 of its hatcheries have the parasite, which kills 90
to 100 percent of the hatchlings it infects.
Across the West, it has put a crimp in the fishing industry, which brings
in more than $1 billion a year to Colorado alone. The disease didn't take
hold in the East, where it was first introduced, because that region has
many free-flowing streams. But out West, it festered in slow-flowing
waters, a prime habitat for the worm that carries the parasite. The worms
are eaten by the fish.
Wildlife officials blame the proliferation of dams that have been built to
satisfy the thirst of growing Western communities. "If you do something
for someone, you do something to someone else," said Terry Sexson, a
spokesman for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in the West. "Now look
what it's done to the wildlife."

A disease that attacks the bone structure of young fish has wiped out 90%
of Colorado's wild rainbow trout in six of the state's best trout streams,
a state study shows. The study by the Colorado Division of Wildlife also
found that Whirling disease has reached 12 of the state's 15 trout
hatcheries, threatening the state's $420 million-a-year fishing industry.
"It's like getting pounded by a sledgehammer. The disease is having a
devastating effect," said Barry Nehring, state fishery biologist and author
of the five-year study. "These were the best of the best rivers in
Colorado."
Whirling disease has killed millions of fish in such rivers as the
Colorado, South Platte, Gunnison, Rio Grande, Cache la Poudre and Dolores.
The disease, which poses no threat to human health, is caused by a
microscopic spore that attacks the bone structure of baby fish. While it
may not kill the fish, the resulting whirling behavior makes the fish
unable to feed normally and more vulnerable to predators.
State officials say Colorado's fish became infected after a private
hatchery unwittingly accepted a shipment of diseased fish from Idaho. The
disease affects trout streams in 22 states. Eradicating the disease from
state fish hatcheries and making improvements to prevent another outbreak
are expected to cost at least $13 million. The hope is to have all
hatcheries disinfected - and producing 3.5 million fish a year - by 2002.
