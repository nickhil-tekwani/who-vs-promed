[The report states that the source of infection was "eating of city waste". If the crows did in fact become infected with and died from H5N1 due to eating contaminated garbage, then the virus must likely be circulating extensively in the country. Based on Bangladesh's last available OIE annual report (January-December 2014; http://tinyurl.com/z2no972), HPAI was reported as being limited to certain zones of the country.

Although West Nile fever has never been officially reported by the country, it would be of interest if this disease was considered in the differential diagnosis of this event. - Mod.CRD
