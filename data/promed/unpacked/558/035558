The Veterinary Services Department has reported a new anthrax outbreak in Chipinge [Manicaland province], which has killed 17 cattle so far. 39 cattle recently succumbed to the disease in Manicaland. The department's director, Dr Josphat Nyika, disclosed on Friday [17 Jan 2014] that they will be sending 6000 vaccines to the affected area this weekend. "In Manzvire District we have lost 15 cattle while in Chisumba only 3 cattle have been reported dead," said Dr Nyika. "We will be sending a new batch of 6,000 vaccines to Manzvire and Chisumba districts on Sunday [19 Jan 2014]. In Makoni, we vaccinated 2800 cattle at Svikini and Gandanzara dip tanks and we are continuously monitoring the situation."

"There were also some reports coming in from Checheche. Our provincial teams have since assembled a task force together with the Ministry of Health and Child Care. There were indications that the disease was spreading to humans. However, we are glad that we have managed to control that threat."

He added the turnout at vaccination posts was slow at first with 900 cattle turning up for the vaccination out of more than 2800 head of cattle. However, things improved after an awareness campaign.

Dr Nyika warned that there could be further outbreaks due to the continuous rains and [he] discouraged people from consuming uninspected meat.

He pointed out that anthrax is prevalent during the rainy season as top soils are washed away by running water. "This exposes anthrax spores to livestock when animals graze close to the ground. Anthrax spores can survive in the soil for more than 40 years," he said.

He urged farmers to carefully dispose of carcasses that would have died of anthrax to avoid contamination. He said farmers should burn or bury the carcass on site instead of carrying it to another place. They should also notify veterinary officers in their areas if they suspect anthrax cases.

"Symptoms of anthrax include sudden deaths of animals, bloated carcasses, blood oozing from all natural openings such as the mouth, nose, and rectum, among others. Humans usually get anthrax through direct contact with infected livestock. This often happens when spores get into cuts on the skin or when they eat infected carcasses. Early treatment with antibiotics is effective when treating anthrax but late or no treatment can be fatal.

Last year [2013] anthrax outbreaks were also reported in Mashonaland West province.

[There are 2 lessons to be learnt from these ongoing reports from Manicaland: (1) When the farming community is unaware of the need to report suspect cases; this is characterised by them coming forward with reports when they see government activity; (2) the veterinary services are chasing after outbreaks, which is exhausting and not cost effective. It is economically and epidemiologically better to both maintain farmer awareness and to reinforce this by effective vaccination programmes ahead of the anthrax season, in this case at the end of the dry season. It is notably easier to get around on country roads during the dry season.
