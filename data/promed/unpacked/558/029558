Poultry and Bird Disease
Suspected in Texas;
Owners Warned to Protect Birds and Poultry

A flock of non-commercial chickens south of El Paso is suspected of having
Exotic Newcastle Disease (END), a foreign-origin virus that is deadly to
poultry and birds.

A U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) veterinarian examined the birds
Saturday, 5 Apr 2003, after receiving a report of high death loss in the
flock. While awaiting laboratory confirmation of the presumptive
diagnosis, which should be completed by Friday, 11 Apr 2003, a team of
state and federal animal health officials has gathered on site to contain the
flock and to assess the area to determine if infection may have spread to
nearby flocks, or if birds or poultry might have been exposed to the
sick birds recently transported from the area.

If the disease is confirmed by the National Veterinary Service Laboratory
in Ames, Iowa, Texas would be the fourth state to be stricken by this
foreign poultry disease since October 2002, when an END outbreak was
detected in California. Since then, the virus also has been found--and
eradicated--in backyard flocks in Arizona and Nevada.

"An END outbreak creates an extremely serious situation for bird owners in
Texas. With the possibility that this disease is in our state, we again
remind bird owners that they must follow strict biosecurity procedures and
movement restrictions in order to guard against the accidental introduction
of disease to their flocks, to other backyard or hobby flocks, or to the
Texas and New Mexico commercial poultry industry," warned Dr. Bob Hillman,
Texas state veterinarian and executive director for the Texas Animal Health
Commission (TAHC), the state's livestock and poultry health regulatory agency.

"Bird and poultry owners must not move birds from the El Paso area," he
said. "When buying birds or poultry, ensure also that they did not
originate from quarantined areas in southern California. Because END can
spread from direct contact, keep newly purchased birds isolated for at
least 30 days. Maintain records on new birds, so if there is a health
problem, we can trace it to the source more quickly."

Dr. Hillman explained that, while END usually has an incubation period of 2
to 15 days, pet birds, especially parrots, can be infectious for more than
a year, without exhibiting any signs of illness. Commonly, END can cause
birds to sneeze or gasp and develop a greenish, watery diarrhea. Birds may
also develop muscle tremors, a twisting of the head and neck,
complete paralysis, or a swelling around the eyes and neck. In many cases,
sudden death loss is the only sign that a problem exists within the flock.

"END does not affect humans, and chicken and eggs are safe to eat. For the
poultry and bird industry, however, END has deadly--and expensive
consequences. Today, more than 1,400 animal health veterinarians and
inspectors from across the country are working on the END outbreak in
southern California, which so far, has spread to 22 commercial poultry
flocks. Another 2400 backyard flocks have either been infected or exposed
to the fast-moving virus, and about 15 500 flocks remain quarantined.

As of early April [2003] , more than 3.5 million birds in southern
California have been destroyed to stop the spread of the disease. In late
winter, END alsowas detected in several backyard flocks in Nevada and
Arizona, but fortunately these small outbreaks were eradicated quickly."

"Do not take chances with your birds," Dr. Hillman reiterated. "By
following some biosecurity practices, you can reduce the chance of
infection in your flock. However, if you see signs of illness or sudden
death loss in your flock, call your private veterinary practitioner or the
TAHC immediately."

Dr. Hillman reminded bird and poultry owners that the TAHC hotline is in
operation 24 hours a day at 1-800-550-8242. TAHC veterinarians, trained as
foreign animal disease diagnosticians, work with private veterinary
practitioners and poultry disease experts free of charge to assess the
flock and collect samples for laboratory testing.

"Please, keep an eye on your birds and poultry. Diseases spread quickly,
so immediate reporting is vital to saving the industry money, time and
heartbreak. The sooner we know of a disease problem, the sooner we can
deal with it and stop the outbreak," said Dr. Hillman.

Dr. Hillman urged bird and poultry owners to abide by the following good
biosecurity practices:

* Don't keep pet birds on commercial poultry operations. Don't allow
employees to maintain their own birds or poultry. Your staff could carry
bacteria or viruses from their birds to yours. Supply clean clothes and
footwear, or disposable coveralls and shoe covers, for your employees to
wear when working with your birds.

* Disinfect tires and the under carriages of all vehicles as they enter or
leave the farm or premises (no 'germs in,' no 'germs out'). In humid,
warm weather, viruses can live on surfaces for weeks, so don't hope that
they will 'wear off' trucks or tires.

* Going to the feed store or coffee shop? Don't work with your birds until
you've changed into clean clothes and disinfected footwear. Viruses can be
tracked into or from stores on boots and clothing.


* Avoid visiting other poultry operations. Dangerous bacteria and viruses
can be transported from one farm to another. If you must loan tools or
equipment, ensure the items are thoroughly cleaned and disinfected prior to
use.

* Maintain good records on purchases and sales. If a disease problem
arises, these documents can help animal health officials track and
eradicate disease.

[The spread from the western states to the western most edge of Texas is
interesting. Cases in other states have involved fighting birds. The
above report does mention that the involvement here is in non-commercial
flocks and one wonders if these may also be fighting birds as was seen in
California, Nevada and Arizona. There is frequently unlicensed transport
of these fighting birds, and such activity may represent biosecurity risks,
as the unlicensed transport is difficult to control. - Mods.TG/MPP]
