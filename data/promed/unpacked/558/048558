- No WPV1 cases have been reported in the past week. There are 11 WPV1 cases reported in 2019 from Afghanistan. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2018 remains 21.
- No WPV1-positive environmental samples were reported in the past week.

Pakistan
- No WPV1 cases have been reported in the past week. There are 45 total number of WPV1 cases in 2019.
- 3 WPV1-positive environmental samples were reported in the past week: 1 each from Quetta and Pishin districts in Balochistan province; 1 from S.I.T.E. in Karachi district, Sindh province. The samples were collected between [1 and 3 Jul 2019].

Nigeria, Lake Chad and West Africa
Nigeria:
- No cases of cVDPV2 have been reported in the past week. There are 12 cVDPV2 cases reported in 2019 so far. The total number of cVDPV2 cases in 2018 remains 34.
- 2 positive environmental samples were reported in the past week from Maidaguri, Borno State. The samples were both collected on [25 Jun 2019].
- Recent confirmation of spread of one of the cVDPV2 outbreaks, both within Nigeria and internationally, underscores the urgent need to fill remaining vaccination gaps in the ongoing outbreak response, and to optimize the geographic extent and operational quality of mOPV2 response.

Lake Chad:
- No case of cVDPV2 has been reported in the past week.
- In the Lake Chad region, cVDPV2 linked to the outbreak originating in Nigeria has been detected in Niger (1 case in 2019 and 10 cases in 2018) and Cameroon (1 positive environmental sample, collected on [20 Apr 2019] in Extreme Nord).
- The risk of further cVDPV2 spread across the Lake Chad subregion remains high.

West Africa:
- No cVDPV2-positive environmental sample was reported in the past week in Ghana.
- A genetically linked cVDPV2 environmental sample to the Jigawa outbreak, Nigeria has been confirmed in Northern province of Ghana.
- Across the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) partnership, the outbreak preparedness and response task team (OPRTT) is working with our regional and country colleagues in supporting local public health authorities in carrying out a full field investigation and determining if there is a risk of local spread of this virus that might require a response.
- Surveillance is also being strengthened in neighbouring Togo, Benin, Cote d'Ivoire and Burkina Faso.

Central Africa
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC):
- 4 cases of cVDPV2 have been reported this week in the DRC: 2 from Kalonda-Ouest and 1 from Nyanga, Kasai province, with onset of paralysis on [3, 7, and 5 Jun 2019]; 1 from Tshumbe, Sankuru province, with onset of paralysis on [14 Jun 2019]. There are 15 reported cases of cVDPV2 in 2019. The total number of cVDPV2 cases reported in 2018 is 20. DRC is currently affected by 8 separate cVDPV2 outbreaks; 1 each originated in Haut Katanga, Mongala, and Sankuru, 2 in Haut Lomami and 3 in Kasai provinces.

Angola:
- No case of cVDPV2 has been reported this week in Angola. A total of 3 cVDPV2 cases from 2 outbreaks are reported in Angola in 2019.

Central African Republic (CAR):
- No case of cVDPV2 has been reported this week in CAR.
- CAR has 2 distinct cVDPV2 outbreaks (4 cases); 1 originated in Bimbo province and 1 in Bambari province. Additionally, the country had also already reported genetically distinct VDPV2s in the same provinces affected by the current outbreaks.
- In response, the government had declared these events to be a national public health emergency and begun implementation of outbreak response.

Horn of Africa
- No case of cVDPV2 has been reported in the Horn of Africa.
- Somalia has reported a total of 15 cVDPV cases (8 type 2, 6 type 3 and 1 coinfection of both type 2 and type 3) since the beginning of the outbreaks. The most recent cVDPV3 virus was from an AFP case from Runingod district, Middle Shabelle province with an onset date of paralysis on [7 Sep 2018]. cVDPV2 has also been detected during 2018 in one environmental sample in Kenya collected on [21 Mar 2018]. There is also one reported case of cVDPV2 in Ethiopia, linked to Somalia, with onset on 20 May 2019.

Papua New Guinea
- No new cases of cVDPV1 were reported this week. The total number of cases in 2018 remains 26.
- The most recent cVDPV1 virus was isolated from an environmental sample collected in the National Capital district on [6 Nov 2018].
- A GPEI Outbreak Response Assessment reviewed the impact of current outbreak response and concluded that overall strong response had been implemented. Commending national and subnational public health authorities and health workers on their efforts, the Assessment team underscored the need on now filling any residual subnational surveillance and immunity gaps.
- The team reviewed all aspects of the response, and noted significant efforts and improvements, including on service delivery, surveillance strengthening, data analysis, cold chain/reverse cold chain refurbishment, vaccine acceptance and community engagement, health worker engagement, collaboration with neighbouring Indonesia and outreach to remote areas/communities. In particular, the group noted the strong collaboration between outbreak response and strengthening of routine immunization, including through systematic collaboration with Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, and highlighted that this model of working should be replicated in other outbreak settings.

Mozambique
- No case of cVDPV2 outbreak has been reported this week. The total number of cases in 2018 remains one.
- In addition to the confirmed case, the same virus was also isolated from 2 healthy community contacts, reported on [10 and 17 Dec 2018].
- The GPEI and partners are working with country counterparts to support the local public health authorities in conducting a field investigation (clinical, epidemiological and immunological) and thorough risk assessment to discuss planning and implementation of immunization and outbreak response.

Indonesia
- No cVDPV1 cases were reported this week.
- In total, 3 genetically linked cVDPV1 isolates were detected from Papua province: a cVDPV1 from an acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) case, with onset of paralysis on [27 Nov 2018], and 2 cVDPV1 isolates from healthy community contacts, collected on [24 Jan 2019] and [13 Feb 2019]. This outbreak is not linked to the cVDPV1 in neighbouring Papua New Guinea.

Iran
- In total, 3 WPV1-positive environmental samples have been reported in 2019, all from Sistan and Balochistan province. The isolated viruses have been detected in environmental samples only, and genetic sequencing confirms they are linked to WPV1 circulating in Karachi, Pakistan.
- The Ministry of Health and local health authorities are undertaking a detailed investigation and the partners of the GPEI are on standby to provide support as required. An immediate risk assessment suggests that this event has limited public health implications, given Iran's very high levels of routine immunization coverage and strong disease surveillance. However, this event further underlines the risk of international spread of WPV1 from Pakistan/Afghanistan.

China
- No cVDPV2 cases were reported in the past week. The total number of cVDPV2 cases in the country remains one.
- China continues to maintain strong routine immunization coverage both with IPV and bivalent OPV reaching more than 95% nationwide, and strong poliovirus surveillance including through environmental surveillance.
- The Government of China is reacting rapidly and efficiently to confirmation of the cVDPV2, by conducting a full field and epi-investigation, strengthening disease surveillance, investigating the origin of the virus and planning an appropriate outbreak response.
- China had successfully responded to a WPV1 outbreak in 2011, stopping an outbreak (due to an importation from Pakistan) in record time.

Myanmar
- No cases of cVDPV1 have been reported this week. The total number of cVDPV1 cases in the country remains 2.
- Myanmar's routine immunization coverage is strong, estimated at 89% at national level for bivalent OPV. Neighbouring countries have been informed of the confirmed cVDPV1, and subnational surveillance is being strengthened across the region.
- The Ministry of Health and local health authorities are undertaking a detailed investigation and the partners of the GPEI are providing support as required. A full epidemiological and virological field investigation is ongoing, including to ascertain the source and origin of the isolated viruses; active surveillance is being strengthened; subnational population immunity levels are being analyzed; and outbreak response is being planned.

[The good news this week is the absence of reports of newly confirmed cases of WPV1 associated paralytic disease. The not so good news are the WPV1-positive environmental samples in Pakistan, confirming that WPV1 is still circulating in the country. Other not so good news includes the 4 newly confirmed cases of cVDPV2 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the positive cVDPV2 environmental samples in Nigeria.

As done in previous posts, to visualize all of this activity, I am putting links to HealthMap/ProMED maps of countries with poliovirus activity during the past 12 months below. The size of the list as it grows is impressive.

[2] Pakistan (Karachi), positive environmental samples, media
Date: Wed 24 Jul 2019
Source: The Express Tribune [edited]
https://tribune.com.pk/story/2020392/1-sewage-samples-seven-karachi-localities-test-positive-poliovirus/


Environmental samples from 7 different locations in Karachi have tested positive for poliovirus, reported Express News. Poliovirus was detected in sewage samples taken from Sohrab Goth, Gadap Town, Hijrat Colony, Saddar, Pakistan Industrial Development Corporation (PIDC), Haji Mureed Goth and Liaquatabad.

Pakistan's polio eradication campaign has hit serious problems with an alarming spike in reported cases that have raised doubts over the quality of vaccination reporting and prompted officials to review their approach to stopping the crippling disease.

The country is one of only 3 in the world where polio is endemic, along with neighbouring Afghanistan and Nigeria, but vaccination campaigns have cut the disease sharply, with only a dozen cases last year [2018] compared with 306 in 2014 and more than 350 000 in 1988, according to Pakistani health officials.

The stubborn hostility against the polio health workers and the high levels of avoidance underline the problems with heavy-handed repeat visits by them and police going after families that refuse vaccination.

In October [2018], the Independent Monitoring Board, which oversees the global polio eradication effort, wrote in its annual report that there was "something seriously wrong with the programme in Pakistan."

In April [2019], fueled by rumours on social media that children were being poisoned by the vaccinations, mobs rioted in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and at least 3 polio workers were killed.

[The above media report, while listing 7 localities in Karachi, does not give the time frame during which these specimens were collected. I chose to post this article as a reminder of what the country is facing in recent times with a growing antivaccine movement and the pre-existing and continuing violence against vaccination workers. - Mod.MPP]
