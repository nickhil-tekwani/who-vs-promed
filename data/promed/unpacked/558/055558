Common virus may be at the heart of obesity
-------------------------------------------
University of Wisconsin researchers have found that mice and chickens
infected with a common human virus [adenovirus type 36 put on much more
fat than uninfected animals. They also have discovered that the same virus
is more prevalent among overweight people, a strong indication that it also
may cause obesity in humans.
In four experiments, the Wisconsin researchers inoculated chickens and mice
with adenovirus type 36, a member of the family [_Adenoviridae_, which
includes [avian, animal and human (47 distinct serotypes) viruses. After
several months, animals infected with adenovirus type 36 weighed only 7
percent more on average than those without the virus, but their bodies
contained more than twice as much fat. "This is the first human virus that
has been shown to cause obesity in animals," said Nikhil Dhurandhar, one of
the study's authors. It is also the first virus the researchers examined,
raising the possibility that other human viruses also may cause obesity.
Dhurandhar and his colleagues picked adenovirus type 36 simply because
little is known about it and the strain is relatively easy to work with.
Their study is being published in the August issue of the International
Journal of Obesity. "It raises a host of very interesting questions," said
John Foreyt, an obesity expert at Baylor College of Medicine. "If it really
does play a role, I think it's a real breakthrough." The latest results do
not indicate that all obesity is caused by viruses, Foreyt said. But they
strongly suggest that infection plays an important role. "There's just so
much more we need to do on this before we can say anything definitive,"
said Richard Atkinson, a University of Wisconsin professor and an one of
the authors of the study.
Unpublished studies in humans show that 20 to 30 percent of overweight
people are infected with adenovirus type 36, compared to about 5 percent of
the lean population. Experts are not completely surprised by the Wisconsin
group's results. In the past few years, they have found signs that many
chronic health conditions are caused by infections. Three microbes are
thought to contribute to clogged arteries. Long thought to be a product of
high stress and a poor diet, ulcers now are known to be caused by the
bacterium _Helicobacter pylori_.In addition, several animal viruses are
known to cause obesity in both animals and humans. But adenovirus type 36
is the first human virus known to cause an increase in fat.
Researchers do not know yet how adenovirus type 36 causes obesity. Infected
animals did not eat more than uninfected ones, suggesting that the virus
decreases energy expenditure rather than increasing appetite. "I feel that
it increases the number of fat cells, which encourages them to store more
fat," said Dhurandhar, who recently joined Wayne State University in
Detroit. The animal obesity viruses appear to work differently from
adenovirus type 36, by damaging the part of the brain that controls
appetite. Wisconsin researchers saw no brain damage in chickens and mice
infected with adenovirus type 36. "Aside from a day or two of cold-like
symptoms", Atkinson said, "the virus produced no observable effects besides
obesity". Paradoxically, animals infected with the virus also had decreased
levels of cholesterol and triglycerides in their blood. Generally, obesity
is associated with high cholesterol and triglyceride levels. Far more
research is needed before practical benefits can be reaped from this
research, Atkinson said. It is still too early to know whether it may be
possible to develop an effective vaccine against obesity or otherwise
counteract the effects of the virus.

[Adenoviruses infect many species of animals and birds. In general, human
adenovirus infections are common and usually asymptomatic. Some serotypes
have been associated with childhood respiratory infections (1, 2, 3, 5 and
6), epidemic keratoconjunctivitis (3, 4, 7, 8, 19 and 37) and
gastrointestinal illness (40 and 41). Adenovirus type 36, however, has not
been associated with any specific illness. The apparent association between
adenovirus-induced fat accumulation in mice and chickens is certainly
interesting, but it requires independent verification. It is premature to
suggest that adenovirus infection is associated with obesity in humans.
(There could be less esoteric explanations). The rationale for the choice
of adenovirus type 36 for these experiments is unusual to say the least. -
