[1] End of the Welsh H7N2 outbreak
Date: Tue 5 Jun 2007

Health officials say that the outbreak of a mild form of bird flu, which
affected 17 people in north Wales, has ended. The 1st case of avian flu was
found last month [May 2007], in poultry on a smallholding near
Cerrigydrudion, Conwy. At its height, 252 people who may have come into
contact with the virus were being monitored.
The National Public Health Service for Wales (NPHS) said there was "no more
risk," but investigations would continue into the outbreak and its causes.
A 1 km (0.62 mile) restriction zone was put in place around the
smallholding at Llanfihangel Glyn Myfyr on 24 May [2007], after the "low
pathogenic" H7N2 strain of bird flu was confirmed in chickens that died
there. Health officials stressed the disease found was not the more
virulent H5N1.
Tests were carried out on people who may have come into contact with the
farm and eventually, 252 people was monitored. Of those, 17 people
suffering conjunctivitis or a flu-like illness were identified with the
bird flu virus. Health officials confirmed on Tuesday [5 Jun 2007], that
those who had been in possible contact with infected birds, or who had been
ill, were now out of the 7 day incubation period for the flu virus.
Marion Lyons, lead consultant in communicable disease control for the NPHS,
said: "There is no more risk of people in North Wales being infected with
the virus. The illness people experienced was, for the most part, not serious."
The NPHS added investigations would continue into the outbreak and how it
occurred. There will also be further testing of the people who had symptoms
and a report into the outbreak will be published. Dr Lyons added: "There
will be lessons to be learned from this outbreak. These include scientific
lessons with the possibility of an addition to the body of knowledge about
bird flu. They also include practical lessons for the handling of other
outbreaks and for the management of a flu pandemic."

[2] LPAI and human disease

Low pathogenicity avian influenzas (LPAIs) and human health
-----------------------------------------------------------
Influenza A/H7N2 virus, as seen in the poultry outbreak described above is
one of many low pathogenicity avian influenzas (1). These have a genotype
associated with causing milder symptoms in birds than the more rare high
pathogenicity viruses [HPAI] and are negative on in vivo test (2,3).
Outbreaks of LPAIs in birds, both wild and domestic poultry, occur
regularly in Europe and are probably more common than recognised.
Serological surveys of domestic poultry have found evidence of outbreaks
that seem to have been missed (4,5). Occasionally, it seems that an LPAI
transforms in birds to become a high pathogenicity avian influenza (HPAI)
strain, but that is thought to be a rare event (4,6).
Human disease due to LPAIs
--------------------------
The fact that an avian influenza is highly pathogenic for birds does not
necessarily mean it is pathogenic for humans. However, one notable
influenza (type A/H5N1) is highly pathogenic for both birds and humans
(7,8). Influenza A/H7N2 virus infection in humans and all other human
infections with LPAIs have only been associated with mild to moderate
self-limiting disease, primarily conjunctivitis or flu-like illness. Some
cases have ended up requiring hospital treatment, but all have recovered.
In addition, it is likely that there are asymptomatic infections and
infections with mild symptoms that are never diagnosed because LPAI is not
suspected and tested for (5). It is unclear whether or not there has ever
been human-to-human transmission of an LPAI virus, although this has
happened with some highly pathogenic viruses (9-11). During case finding in
outbreaks, people are often found to have symptoms compatible with LPAI
infection, but turn out not to be infected (6). This was seen in an
influenza A/H7N3 virus outbreak in the United Kingdom (UK) in 2006, when a
single poultry worker presented with conjunctivitis and had confirmed
infection, but others with similar symptoms were test-negative (12).
Who is at risk from LPAIs?
--------------------------
Following requests from European Union (EU) member states and the European
Commission, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC)
is undertaking a formal risk assessment for avian influenza viruses
(excluding H5N1) in relation to human health. [The authors] also posted a
document examining this outbreak and its implications on [the ECDC] website
on 28 May 2007 (10) [or see ProMED-mail "Avian influenza H7N2, human - UK
(Wales) (06) 20070601.1772". - Mod.CP]. After a thorough review of the
literature, [the author's] assessment was that there is only limited public
health risk from LPAIs, but that those who are at risk should nevertheless
maintain vigilance and take precautions. The risk of infection with LPAIs
is almost entirely confined to people who have close contact with domestic
poultry (chickens, ducks etc) or their droppings. Human cases have almost
entirely been in this category (11). People with small domestic and pet
flocks are probably most at risk, as they are less likely to be able to
take precautions than those working in industry and may be less aware of
the dangers. Other groups that have occasionally been infected are
veterinarians and people involved in controlling outbreaks in birds
(culling) and people who work on industrial poultry farms. For the vast
majority of people, who have no direct contact with domestic birds or their
droppings, the risk of acquiring LPAIs and the risk to health are almost
non-existent. Human infection with LPAIs from wild birds has never been
reported.
What actions should those with domestic poultry take?
-----------------------------------------------------
The advice from the ECDC has not changed and is the same as for reducing
the risk of acquiring infection with HPAIs. People with small domestic
flocks in Europe should always look out for ill health in their birds and
promptly report such to the authorities. They and their families should
also maintain basic hygiene, as this will minimise the risk of them
catching LPAIs and the more dangerous pathogens that poultry may carry,
such as campylobacter and salmonellosis. The ECDC has produced model
guidance on this for use by national authorities (12).
What is the risk of a pandemic resulting from an LPAI?
------------------------------------------------------
Essentially this risk is unknown and unknowable. It is thought that each of
the 3 pandemics of the 20th century had a link with avian influenza, as
some avian genes seem to have appeared in the resulting human pandemic
strain. Although there is particular concern about avian influenza H5N1
because of its high pathogenicity in humans and its stability over time in
bird populations, there is no prima facie reason to imagine that the next
pandemic strain will contain genes from a HPAI rather than an LPAI (13,14).
