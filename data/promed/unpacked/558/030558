The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) is today (5 Jan 2015) closely monitoring an additional human case of avian influenza A(H7N9) in Shenzhen notified by the Health and Family Planning Commission of Guangdong Province (GDHFPC) and again urged the public to maintain strict personal, food and environmental hygiene both locally and during travel.

According to the GDHFPC, the female patient, aged 6, was hospitalised for isolation and management in stable condition.

A man from Dongguan, Guangdong Province, China is the latest person to contract avian influenza A(H7N9). According to the GDHFPC [Health and Family Planning Commission of Guangdong Province], the male patient, aged 36, was hospitalized for isolation and management and was in critical condition.

To date, 457 human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) have been reported by the Mainland health authorities, respectively in Zhejiang (141 cases), Guangdong (114 cases), Jiangsu (59 cases), Shanghai (42 cases), Hunan (24 cases), Fujian (23 cases), Anhui (17 cases), Jiangxi (8 cases), Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (8 cases), Beijing (5 cases), Shandong (5 cases), Henan (4 cases), Guangxi (3 cases), Jilin (2 cases), Guizhou (1 case) and Hebei (1 case).

This brings the total cases reported, including cases exported out of China, to 473.

Abstract:
"The emergence of human infection with a novel H7N9 influenza virus in China raises a pandemic concern. Chicken H9N2 viruses provided all 6 of the novel reassortant's internal genes. However, it is not fully understood how the prevalence and evolution of these H9N2 chicken viruses facilitated the genesis of the novel H7N9 viruses. Here, we show that over more than 10 years of cocirculation of multiple H9N2 genotypes, a genotype (G57) emerged that had changed antigenicity and improved adaptability in chickens. It became predominant in vaccinated farm chickens in China, caused widespread outbreaks in 2010-2013 before the H7N9 viruses emerged in humans, and finally provided all of their internal genes to the novel H7N9 viruses. The prevalence and variation of H9N2 influenza virus in farmed poultry could provide an important early warning of the emergence of novel reassortants with pandemic potential."

Abstract:
"Influenza A virus (IAV) infections in hosts outside the main aquatic bird reservoirs occur periodically. Although most such cross-species transmission events experience limited onward transmission in the new host, sustained influenza outbreaks have occurred in poultry and in a number of mammalian species including humans, pigs, horses, seals and mink. Recently, 2 distinct strains of IAV have emerged in domestic dogs, with each circulating widely for several years. Here, we briefly outline what is known about the role of intermediate hosts in influenza emergence, summarize our knowledge of the new canine influenza viruses (CIVs) and how they provide key new information on the process of host adaptation, and assess the risk these viruses pose to human populations." - Mod.LK
