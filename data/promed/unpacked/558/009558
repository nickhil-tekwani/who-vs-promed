While avian influenza has been successfully checked in Western Europe and
much of Southeast Asia apart from Indonesia, it is still expanding in
Africa and will remain a threat for years to come, FAO Deputy
Director-General David Harcharik told a high-level meeting of the United
Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) in Geneva today.
"In the majority of cases, wherever HPAI [highly pathogenic avian
influenza] has made its appearance we, the global community and the
countries concerned have been able to stop it in its tracks," Mr Harcharik
said, speaking at an ECOSOC special event meeting on bird flu.
But "HPAI poses a continuing threat and we must brace ourselves to go on
fighting it, quite likely for years," he warned. HPAI, he said, was still a
source of concern in Indonesia and continued to spread in Africa, where it
risked becoming endemic in several countries.
Mr Harcharik cited difficulties in enforcing appropriate control measures
such as culling, farmer compensation and checks on animal movements in
African countries. Another complication was illegal trade in poultry.
"Until such trade is effectively checked by stronger official veterinary
authorities, and until better surveillance, alert-response, diagnostics and
reporting [are] achieved, the risk will remain with us," Mr Harcharik said.
In the 2.5 years of the present avian influenza emergency, some 200 million
poultry have been culled, causing losses of 10 billion dollars in Southeast
Asia alone. At last count in early July 2006 there had been 229 human cases
of H5N1 infection resulting in the deaths of 131 persons.

The Secretary-General of the Nigerian Veterinary Association, Dr Bala
Mohammed, has said in spite of assurances by the Federal Government to the
effect that bird flu was a forgone conclusion, the disease was yet to be
eradicated.
Mohammed said the deadly H5N1 bird flu has hit Nigeria repeatedly according
to recent research findings in spite of government assurances.
According to him, "there has been some kind of a resurgence in Taraba and
Lagos states. Some people believe the bird flu had gone, but for those on
the job, the heat is on. We have new cases in Lagos and Taraba states."
Researchers said Nigeria may have been hit by different strains of bird
flu, raising the risk of human infection.
Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) representative in Nigeria, Helder
Muteia, said surveillance is being stepped up to get a clearer picture of
the current outbreak.
"We have designed an active surveillance programme, because we have to
know. Until this moment, we had a very passive surveillance strategy. So,
let us have an active surveillance. That means to go to the field and to
find out what is going on there, instead of waiting for people to announce
any outbreak. We are starting an active surveillance very soon to know
exactly what is going on."
"A whole lot of problems that I feel will have to be sorted out. Until
things are done properly, until regulatory agencies collaborate, until we
get -- either remotely or actively -- farmers to report cases, we would not
get out of the problem,"he said.
