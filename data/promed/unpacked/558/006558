["Newcastle disease (ND) is a highly contagious and often severe disease found worldwide that affects birds including domestic poultry. It is caused by a virus in the family of paramyxoviruses. The disease appears in 3 forms: lentogenic or mild, mesogenic or moderate and velogenic or very virulent, also called exotic Newcastle disease. The lentogenic strains are very widespread but cause few disease outbreaks. It usually presents as a respiratory disease, but depression, nervous manifestations, or diarrhoea may be the predominant clinical form."

"Newcastle disease is a minor zoonosis (disease of animals that can also infect humans) and can cause conjunctivitis in humans, but the condition is generally very mild and self-limiting." Source: OIE-Newcastle disease https://www.oie.int/en/disease/newcastle-disease/
