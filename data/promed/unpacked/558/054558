Firearms and an "anarchist type textbook" were found in the same motel
room where several vials of the deadly toxin ricin was found, police
said Friday [29 Feb 2008]. The room was most recently occupied by a
57-year-old man who has been in critical condition with breathing
problems at a hospital for more than 2 weeks.

Capt. Joseph Lombardo said at a news conference late Friday [29 Feb
2008] that the book was tabbed at a spot with information about ricin.
Lombardo did not give more information about the book or specify what
kinds of weapons were found.

Las Vegas police said there was no apparent link to terrorist activity
[in spite of the above findings? - Mod.JW], and no indication of any
spread of the deadly substance beyond the several vials of powder
found in a plastic bag in the man's room on Thursday [28 Feb 2008].
But what the ricin was doing there remained a mystery.

Police cordoned off the hotel and told residents to stay in their
rooms. The cordon was lifted early Friday morning [29 Feb 2008}, and
the motel has been open since then.

Las Vegas police Deputy Chief Kathy Suey said the manufacture of ricin
is a crime, but it was not clear the substance found belonged to the
man, who was hospitalized in critical condition 14 Feb 2008 after
summoning an ambulance to the motel and complaining of respiratory
distress. The man was unconscious and unable to speak, Suey said,
adding that he was not currently a suspect. Suey said, "We don't even
know that it was him that was in possession of the ricin." She said
she could not say how much ricin was in the vials.

An American Medical Response paramedic crew that took the man to the
hospital about 11 a.m. 14 Feb 2008 had no indication of ricin
poisoning, AMR general manager John Wilson said. Wilson would not say
whether the 2 paramedics who handled the call entered the man's room,
but said neither have shown symptoms of exposure. [If the previous
report quoted by ProMED -- see ref. below -- is accurate, the man was
found unconscious. So unless he was lying outside somewhere, they
must have entered. - Mod.JW].

Naomi Jones, spokeswoman for Spring Valley Hospital, said the patient
was in critical condition when he arrived at the hospital. She said
Las Vegas police contacted the hospital Wednesday [27 Feb 2008] about
a possible ricin exposure investigation.

"The investigation started 2 days ago, that's when we began
cooperating," Jones said. "The patient who has been exposed is not
contagious to anyone else, as ricin has to be injected, ingested or
inhaled." Police refused to comment on whether the hospital was
contacted Wednesday [27 Feb 2008], a day before police said the ricin
was found. [This is a strange discrepancy. - Mod.JW].

Greg Evans, director of the Institute for Biosecurity at Saint Louis
University in Missouri, said the fact that the man suffered
respiratory illness
suggested he was exposed to a powder fine enough to float in the air.
Multiple vials would probably contain enough ricin to sicken many
people if it was spread, for example, around a buffet table or sprayed
in a closed room. "If it was aerosolized in a confined space then it
certainly could harm dozens of people," he said.

Suey said there were several pets in the room when officers arrived. A
dog was found dead but the animal had gone at least a week withoutfood
or water, Suey said, and she did not attribute the death to ricin.
[There are no details about the other pets which had survived more
than a week without food or water. - Mod.JW]

Tom Obrig, an expert on ricin who teaches nephrology at the
University of Virginia, said there have been about 700 reports over
the years of people trying to commit suicide by eating castor beans.
"Usually it doesn't work because it's not digested well," he said.
[The beans must be adequately chewed to release the toxin. - Mod.LL].

For the most part, however, the toxin has more of a cloak-and-dagger
reputation linked closely to spies and assassins. He recalled
one particularly famous murder in 1978 involving Georgi Ivanov
Markov, a Bulgarian dissident in London. Markov "was standing on a
corner waiting for a bus and some spy came along and injected a
pellet in his leg from an umbrella," Obrig said. "The guy died 3 days
later. It was traced back by Scotland Yard who figured the only thing
potent enough to do that was ricin."

[This report gives some additional details about the time line here.
No information is known (or at least released) regarding the
hospitalized man or his "friend or relative." It is possible,
perhaps, that he was a target of a ricin attack.

Although "there was no apparent link to terrorist activity," someone,
perhaps the hospitalized man (we still are not certain but suspect
ricin disease), may have been planning to use the ricin at least as a
threat, if not try to kill someone.

Infectious Diseases. Springer-Humana, New York (in press):

Secondary aerosols
------------------
"No clear data is available regarding the potential of secondary
aerosols of ricin in the environment. The molecule, however, is
inactivated on surfaces by hypochlorite solutions such as 0.5 percent
sodium hypochlorite that can be used on skin after extensive washing
with soap and water. The toxin is, however, not inactivated by low
chlorine levels or by iodine. Although stable at ambient
temperatures, it is detoxified by heat either 80 degrees C for 10
minutes or 50 degrees C at pH 7.8 for an hour. There should be little
concern regarding a toxic dermal exposure per se since, unless
enhanced by solvents such as DMSO, absorption is insignificant."

Diagnosis
---------
"Specific confirmation of the diagnosis requires the detection of
ricin in or on the victim or, in survivors since the toxin is quite
immunogenic, rising anti-ricin antibodies developing by 2 weeks after
the illness. Ricin is quickly metabolized. In rats, only 11 percent
of an intravenously administered dose remains after 24 hours with
most of the toxin excreted in the urine as low molecular weight
metabolites. Additionally, regardless of the route of exposure, the
toxin is rapidly tissue bound so that direct tissue
immunohistological analysis may be preferable to body fluid testing.
Franz and Jaax state that, after a ricin inhalation, the castor bean
poison could be detectable from a nasal mucosal swab for at least 24
hours after exposure. ELISA using either polyclonal or monoclonal
antibody can detect ricin. If assays could be developed to detect the
low molecular weight metabolites of ricin, urine ricin testing could
be valuable even after several days. Among the methods to detect
ricin antibody is a biological system assaying the ability of a
sample to protect a tissue culture line against ricin toxicity."

Passive and Active Protection
-----------------------------
"Recently, a recombinant ricin A chain containing mutations at known
toxic sites has been shown to be nontoxic and immunogenic in humans.
In rodents, immunization was protective against either gastric or
aerosol ricin challenge.

Passive immunization against an aerosolized ricin exposure has also
been studied. Aerosol administered polyclonal goat anti-ricin IgG was
protective in a mouse model when ricin aerosol was administered 1
hour later but some lung pathology occurred in survivors. Polyclonal
antibody was also protective when given intravenously. Monoclonal
antibody was also protective against ricin toxicity in vitro and in
vivo when given before and after challenge. Pretreatment alone
delayed the onset of toxicity and death." - Mod.LL]
