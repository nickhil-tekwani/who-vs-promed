["In Europe, the 1st outbreaks of HPAI H5N8 were reported in August 2020 in Russia in both poultry and wild birds. Since then, a new wave of outbreaks of H5N8 has been continuously reported in several of the European countries especially in wild birds but also in poultry starting from mid-October [2020]. The H5N8 virus has also reassorted with other wild bird influenza viruses to form new strains of H5N5 and H5N1 HPAI virus, which were also reported by countries. A few Asian countries also reported HPAI H5N8 outbreaks in poultry and/or wild birds. It is more likely that the source of introduction in these outbreaks is through migratory wild birds and onward local spread. Report of increased number of outbreaks in wild birds indicate periods of heightened risk in countries due to migratory flyways during this season. Consequently, improving on-farm biosecurity measures is a priority to reduce the likelihood of exposure to poultry."
