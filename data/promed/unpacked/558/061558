A doctors' body on Wednesday, 2 Dec 2015, attributed the increase in the number of hepatitis B cases in the valley to the lack of vaccination among healthcare workers. In a statement issued here, the Doctors Association Kashmir (DAK) said that unvaccinated healthcare workers were responsible for the spread of the virus. Terming the situation as alarming, the President DAK Dr Nisar ul Hassan said that unvaccinated healthcare workers (HCWs) were a constant source of infection and risk lives of patients.

"The unprotected medical personnel are vulnerable to HBV infection which they can pass to hundreds of patients they come into contact with each day and can lead to institutional and community outbreaks," he said in the statement.

Dr Hassan said that it is unethical to leave the workers unimmunized as it endangered public health. "Majority of our doctors, nurses and paramedics are not vaccinated against HBV as they have not been offered. Some of them have been partially immunized and quite a few have received all 3 doses of vaccine but have not checked their antibody titer to confer 100 percent protection," claimed Dr. Hassan.

Although, he said, HBV vaccine is currently administered to all children and infants as part of universal immunization program but majority of adults especially those at high risk are unprotected and should be vaccinated. Blood banks, unsafe therapeutic injections and unhygienic dental clinics continue to be important modes of transmission, he said.

An estimated 2 billion persons worldwide have been infected and more than 400 million are chronic carriers of which 40 million are in India.
"The best way to protect high risk groups is vaccination and it is obligatory on state to vaccinate HCWs on priority to protect public health,"
he added.

[No direct information is given to support the alleged nosocomial transmission.

As previously noted regarding this "outbreak" of hepatitis B, it is difficult to assess how many of the patients have acute hepatitis B and how many have chronic infection when diagnosed. They can be differentiated serologically by the presence of IgM anti-hepatitis B core antigen in the blood in acute cases. When hepatitis B is acquired in adulthood, generally 5-10 percent of those affected will be chronic carriers with a risk of cirrhosis and primary hepatocellular carcinoma. However, if the disease is acquired neonatally from vertical transmission from infected mother to neonate, the risk of that individual being a chronic carrier can be 95 percent. The hepatitis B vaccine is quite effective and safe in preventing infection. In chronically infected individuals, there are a number of medications that can be useful in treatment include lamivudine, tenofovir, and adefovir, all used in HIV treatment as reverse transcriptase inhibitors.

Spread of hepatitis B in the health care setting can occur from provider to patient and vice versa. Overall the HBV carrier rate in the country is around 4 percent but it is unclear how many of these are health care professionals. Unlike airborne spread diseases, HBV requires parenteral transmission in the health care setting and, at least in the developed world, is by far more likely to be transmitted from patients to health care workers than the reverse. Doug LaBrecque and I with several colleagues and the University of Iowa examined this more than 30 years ago and found that, in a variety of situations, the risk of transmission is quite small when appropriate infection control is practiced.

Abstract
-----------
"A prospective study was designed to determine the risk of hepatitis B transmission from health care deliverers to patients in the hospital setting. Six chronic carriers of hepatitis B were identified: 2 surgeons, 1 dialysis nurse, 1 pediatric ICU nurse, 1 pharmacist and 1 orderly. Three of the six were HBeAg-positive. Two of the HBeAg-positive chronic carriers also had circulating hepatitis B virus DNA and accounted for approximately two-thirds of the total patient contacts. Two hundred thirteen patients were exposed 450 times to these six hepatitis B carrier staff without evidence of hepatitis B acquisition over a 6-month follow up. One-hundred nineteen control patients, exposed 789 times to noncarrier health care deliverers, were also negative. Another 33 patients were exposed to three additional individuals who were in the prodrome of acute hepatitis B: an intensive care nurse, a dental hygienist and a medical student. These patients showed no evidence of hepatitis B during 6 months of follow-up, nor did 25 separate control patients. Thus, 246 patients were exposed a total of 483 times to nine health care personnel who had either acute or chronic hepatitis B. No evidence of hepatitis B transmission was found. One-hundred forty-four controls revealed similar results after 814 exposures. Based on the number of exposures to chronic carriers alone, the risk of hepatitis B transmission is estimated to be less than 1%. Our data suggest that, with observation of appropriate hospital technique, the risk of hepatitis B transmission by health care workers is relatively low, even in the high risk settings of surgery or renal dialysis performed by an HBeAg-positive hepatitis B virus DNA-positive carrier. Available accumulated data do not support the automatic exclusion of chronic HBsAg carrier health care workers from any area of primary patient care."

Nevertheless, the HBV immunization of health care workers and the appropriate use of infection control to prevent blood to blood exposures in the nosocomial setting will decrease transmission in this arena.
