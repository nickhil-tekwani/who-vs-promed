Ebola Uganda: case fatality rates in Masindi
-------------------------------------
In his message on Ebola case fatality rates in Uganda [ProMED-mail posting
entitled 'Ebola hemorrhagic fever - Uganda (08),' dated 3 Feb 2001, Dr
Calisher has commented on differences between case fatality rates (CFR) in
and outside Gulu (38% vs. 72%). He suggests that undetected less severe
cases outside Gulu could explain the difference.
We would like to point out that CFR in confirmed (!) Ebola cases in one of
the Ebola wards in Gulu has been 58 per cent, according to Dan Bausch, who
worked there for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In
Masindi, CFR was 16/24 or 66% in confirmed cases. This is not a remarkable
difference. More importantly, local circumstances in Masindi do not suggest
that less severe cases remained undetected more frequently than in Gulu.
The same case definitions and surveillance procedures were used in both places.
In contrast to Gulu, it was well known in Masindi when, where, and how
Ebola virus was introduced into the district, and how it spread: the index
case was a former patient from Lacor hospital (close to Gulu); 19 more
cases were observed in the index case's extended family, 6 cases among
health workers caring for them, and one case in a contact of a health
worker. This adds up to the 27 cases officially declared by the Ministry of
Health (24 confirmed cases). All contacts were followed up on a daily
basis, and no case or chain of transmission with unknown origin was ever
observed.
