North Dinajpur district administration has decided to kill around 14
000 birds in several villages under Daspara and Ghinnigaon gram
panchayats [villages] near the Chopra police station of the district
in the next 4 days. The decision followed the official announcement
declaring the block as bird flu affected. It was reported that
hundreds of birds died in the region over the past week, alarming the
district administration. The North Dinajpur animal husbandry
department officials promptly visited the 'affected' villages and
collected samples from the dead birds, which were later sent to a
Pune-based national laboratory. The laboratory report confirmed bird
flu in the area. The culling exercise is scheduled to commence
tomorrow [30 Mar 2009].

The deputy director of the North Dinajpur animal husbandry department,
Mr Sajal Bhunia, said that his department had formed around 40 teams
to complete the exercise at the earliest.
