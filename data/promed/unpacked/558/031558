West Nile Virus National Surveillance Report
--------------------------------------------
English Edition
14 Aug 2005 - 20 Aug 2005 (Week 33)
Human:
During week 33, 31 West Nile virus (WNV) cases were reported in Quebec (1),
Ontario (12), Manitoba (8), Saskatchewan (8), and Alberta (2). As of the 20
Aug 2005, a total of 51 human WNV cases have been reported to the Public

Bird:
During week 33, 235 dead birds were tested and 71 (30 percent) were reported
positive for WNV (see bird table). 13 new health units reported dead birds
positive for WNV, including one region in Alberta (Palliser), one region in
Saskatchewan (Prince-Albert-Parkland), 8 health units in Ontario (Durham,
Elgin-St.Thomas, Grey-Bruce-Owen Sound, Haldiman-Norfolk, Haliburton-Kawartha,
Leeds-Grenville-Lanark, Perth, Windsor-Essex), and 3 regions in Quebec
(Lanaudiere, Montreal-Centre, Outaouais). A total of 3191 dead birds have been
tested since 2 May 2005, of which 252 (7.9 percent) were positive for WNV.
Domestic Animal:
As of week 33, 4 horses positive for WNV were reported in Manitoba (2) and
Saskatchewan (2). In addition, 2 domestic birds positive for WNV were reported
in Manitoba.
Mosquito:
As of week 33, 233 mosquito pools positive for WNV were reported in Manitoba
(50), Ontario (114), Saskatchewan (60) and Quebec (9). National West Nile
virus surveillance data and maps can be found on the Public Health Agency of
Canada (PHAC) web site at:

Provinces/Territories: Detailed WNV information can be accessed throug the
Links section on the PHAC WNV web site.

* Cases with neurologic manifestations (such as WN meningitis, WN
encephalitis, WN myelitis)
** Cases with no evidence of neuroinvasion
*** Illnesses for which insufficient clinical information was provided
**** Total number of human cases of WNV illness reported to ArboNET by state
and local health departments.
Neuroinvasive Disease refers to severe disease cases, particularly West Nile
meningitis and West Nile encephalitis. Click here [on CDC website] for further
explanations of neuroinvasive West Nile virus disease and West Nile fever.
West Nile fever refers to typically less severe cases that show no evidence of
neuroinvasion. West Nile fever is not currently on the list of nationally
notifiable diseases, and therefore it is optional whether or not state health
departments report these cases to CDC [further explanations of neuroinvasive
West Nile virus disease and West Nile fever are available at the URL above].
"Other Clinical" includes persons with clinical manifestations other than WN
fever, WN encephalitis or WN meningitis, such as acute flaccid paralysis.
Unspecified cases are those for which sufficient clinical information was not
provided.
Total Human Cases Reported to CDC - These numbers reflect both mild and severe
human disease cases occurring between 1 Jan through 30 Aug 2005 that have been
reported to ArboNet by state and local health departments. ArboNet is the
national, electronic surveillance system established by CDC to assist states
in tracking West Nile virus and other mosquito-borne viruses. Information
regarding 2005 virus/disease activity is posted when such cases are reported
to CDC.
Of the 689 cases, 275 (40 percent) were reported as West Nile meningitis or
encephalitis (neuroinvasive disease), 384 (56 percent) were reported as West
Nile fever (milder disease), and 30 (4 percent) were clinically unspecified at
this time. Please refer to state health department web sites for further
details regarding state case totals.
Note: The high proportion of neuroinvasive disease cases among reported cases
of West Nile virus disease reflects surveillance reporting bias. Serious cases
are more likely to be reported than mild cases. Also, the surveillance system
is not designed to detect asymptomatic infections. Data from population-based
surveys indicate that among all people who become infected with West Nile
virus (including people with asymptomatic infections) less than 1 percent will
develop severe neuroinvasive disease. See: Mostashari F, Bunning ML, Kitsutani
PT, et al. Epidemic West Nile Encephalitis, New York, 1999: Results of a
household-based seroepidemiological survey. Lancet 2001;358:261-264.

[Within one week' the number of states from which human cases have been
reported to CDC has increased from 25 to 31. The total case count has grown
dramatically. 188 new cases of human infections in 7 days (approximately 27
per day) have been reported nationwide. When all avian, animal, and mosquito
WNV infections are taken into account, 44 states have been affected as of 30
Aug 2005. The current epidemic season is far from being over. - Mod.RY]
