Tests Show India Powder Not Anthrax
------------------------------------------------
BOMBAY, India (AP) -- Tests conducted at a military laboratory showed that
a white powdery substance found in an envelope mailed to an Indian state
government office last week does not contain anthrax spores, officials said
Monday. One of 2 previous tests on the substance came back positive. But
the latest examination, conducted by the national Defense Research and
Development Organization, was negative, Maharashtra state health secretary
Subhash Salunke said. The letter arrived on Oct. 24 at the office of the
second highest ranking official in the western state of Maharashtra, deputy
chief minister Chagan Bhujbal.
The suspicious envelope was one more than 200 that have been tested in
India since anthrax spores were discovered in the mail in the United
States. None of the others have tested positive for anthrax.
