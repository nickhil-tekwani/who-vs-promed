During the gulf war, the Defense Ministry has now admitted, British
soldiers' tents were sprayed repeatedly with organo-phosphate insecticides to
combat flies and other insects.
Soldiers who were affected have complained of chronic fatigue, memory
loss, muscle pain, depression and other symptoms.
Some veterans say they are convinced their lives and health were wrecked
by the pesticides, by a "cocktail" of injections against various diseases, or
by a combination of the two.
Fifty-one thousand British troops served in the Persian Gulf area, and
there have been reports that up to 3,000 veterans, wives and children have
fallen ill. In the U.S., there are 78,000 veterans with unexplained illnesses
that they attribute to gulf war syndrome.
Former Cpl. Terry Walker of the Royal Ordnance Corps said he was living in
a "fog" of pesticide sprayed four or five times a day over his camp. He said
he left the army with headaches, rashes, swollen joints and stomach cramps.
His daughter Kirsty, 2, has had similar digestive problems and skin rashes.
Other veterans also say their wives and children have been affected.
Veterans said spraying even took place over tent canteens where soldiers
were eating.
Troops also were vaccinated against anthrax, plague, whooping cough,
cholera, tetanus, typhoid, polio and yellow fever. Some also were vaccinated
against hepatitis B, and some were given pills to protect them against
possible exposure to chemical weapons.
Many veterans say they suspect the vaccines may have contributed to their
illnesses. They have demanded more information about the content of
injections they received, but the Defense Ministry has said this is
classified. The ministry has admitted it did no long-term research into the
effects of a cocktail of vaccines given over short periods.
