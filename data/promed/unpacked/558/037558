The NPPO of Germany recently informed the EPPO Secretariat of the 1st record of grapevine flavescence doree phytoplasma (EPPO A2 List) on its territory. In October 2014, the pathogen was detected in grapevine (_Vitis vinifera_ cv. 'Chardonnay/SO4') in a nursery officially registered for the production of grapevine plants, located in Rheinland-Pfalz (Rhineland-Palatinate).

Diseased grapevine plants showed typical symptoms of flavescence doree. This finding was made during a monitoring programme. The phytoplasma was identified by the Julius Kuhn-Institute using different PCR methods, and sequencing was done by INRA [National Institute for Agricultural Research] in France. The lot concerned included 4400 grafted plants, [for which] scion and rootstock [material] originated from Germany and an Italian nursery, respectively. The vector of the disease, _Scaphoideus titanus_, is not known to occur in Germany.

Investigations have been initiated to trace back the possible origin of this infection. Phytosanitary measures have been taken to eradicate the disease. The movement of plants that are grafted on rootstocks of the same origin has been forbidden. Survey activities are on-going, and additional measures are planned.

[Flavescence doree (FD) is the most important and destructive phytoplasma disease of grapevines due to its fast rate of spread within vineyards. The disease was 1st reported in 1954 in France and has been spreading in southern Europe. FD was thought to have been introduced from the USA, the home of its vector. It is caused by a phytoplasma (_Candidatus_ Phytoplasma vitis) belonging to the 16SrV (elm yellows) group. The only known natural hosts are _Vitis vinifera_ and interspecific hybrids, but some wild American _Vitis_ species may be asymptomatic carriers.

Symptoms usually appear in late spring and may include shortened internodes, stunting, leaves with downward rolled margins and drooping shoots. Leaves turn yellow in white grape cultivars and red in red ones. Leaf necrosis and bark splitting may also develop; the crop is severely reduced, and some vines die, usually in the year following infection. The survivors continue to harbour the pathogen but appear symptomless (latent infections) unless they are re-infected.

FD is spread by the vine leafhopper _Scaphoideus titanus_ and through infected propagation material. Symptomless budwood can carry both eggs of the vector and the pathogen. Reliable diagnosis in both symptomatic and asymptomatic host tissue (preferably by molecular methods) is vital for disease management, which may include pathogen exclusion, certification of clean propagation material and removal of infected plants (pathogen reservoirs). Insecticides can reduce vector numbers. The phytoplasma may be eliminated by treating dormant canes with water at 45-50 C [113-122 F] (heat therapy).

So far, FD had only been reported from southern Europe, and this 1st report of FD in Germany is suggested above to be due to a quarantine incursion with infected Italian rootstocks. It is not stated, however, whether besides the phytoplasma, the originally imported material could also have harboured eggs of the vector, or whether it was treated against insects. The presence of FD in central Europe now may pose a risk of the disease and/or possibly the vector spreading in the region as another example of "warm climate diseases" getting established in cooler regions due to climate change (see, for example, Esca disease of grapevine, ProMED-mail post 20141024.2895414).
