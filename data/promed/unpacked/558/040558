A Roanoke physician who died Mon 12 Nov 2007 may be the 1st death
from food-borne botulism poisoning in Virginia since 2002. A relative
said that medical authorities told the family of the 57-year-old
female physician that her death may be related to botulism poisoning.
The doctor's younger brother said the family is still awaiting
laboratory results to confirm that the death was caused by botulism.
They expect those results Thu 15 Nov 2007, he said.

The brother said the state health department approached the family
last week about the doctor's illness. The doctor's husband is also
ill and was still hospitalized, he said, and added that he doesn't
know whether that illness is also related to botulism.

The relative's comments come a day after the Virginia Department of
Health said it is investigating 2 reported cases of possible
food-borne botulism in the Alleghany-Roanoke City Health District,
which includes Roanoke County, where the couple lives.

On Tue 13 Nov 2007, the health department would not specify when and
where the cases originated or whether either one was fatal. They said
the 2 cases are related to home-canned food and are isolated
incidents confined to a single household.

[ProMED would appreciate more information regarding all 4 cases,
whether botulism is indeed proven, and what the toxin type(s) are. It
would seem unusual to have a number of suspected or proven cases over
a short period of time.

The city and county of Roanoke are located in the central part of
Virginia just west of the Blue Ridge Mountains and can be found on a
