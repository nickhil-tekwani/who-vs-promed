American foulbrood disease is killing the bee population and this is threatening the pollination of next season's crop. "It is a crisis. There is no known cure for the brood. It is the Aids of honeybees," says Mike Miles, chairman of the SA [South Africa] Bee Industry Organisation.

With 1/3 of the Cape's bees infected, there will not be enough hives to rent to farmers for the pollination of fruit, an industry worth Rand 7-billion [about USD 530 million], said Miles. "If you do not have enough bees to pollinate you suffer a bad crop. Our export market collapses and so does foreign revenue earnings," Miles said. Among the vegetables and fruits needing bees for pollination are plums, pears, apples, melons, pumpkins, and butternut.

[A beekeeper says he] fears a pandemic without state intervention. Riaan van Zyl of the department of agriculture, forestry and fisheries said the department was investigating and would draw up a plan.

[American foulbrood (AFB) is caused by _Paenibacillus larvae_, a spore-forming gram-positive bacterium. AFB is a severe and notiÔ¨Åable disease of honeybees. _P. larvae_ is endemic to bee colonies worldwide. Spores are highly resilient and can survive in honey for years.

The infection can be transmitted to larvae by nurse bees or by spores remaining at the base of a brood cell. The susceptibility of larvae to AFB disease decreases with increasing age. Larvae cannot be infected later than 53 hours after the egg has hatched. This disease can result in severe colony losses. It affects only the brood, is highly contagious and extremely difficult to eradicate. The bacterial spores can remain viable for up to 60 years and are extremely resistant to heat extremes and chemicals.

Larvae can be killed rapidly at an early age when they are curled at the base of uncapped brood cells. Adult worker bees will remove these dead larvae leaving only an empty cell. Other larvae will die later on in their development, when they are in an upright position, filling most of the brood cell. Often the larvae or pupae will die after brood cell capping.

Infected larvae die and a distinctive foul smell develops upon decomposition. At this stage the remains can be drawn out as a string (that is, extend up to 10-30 mm [0.4-1.2 in]). There after the remains dry out to dark and highly infectious foulbrood scales that remain in the cell. Infected colonies have scattered and uneven brood patterns with dark, greasy looking, sunken cappings.
