Puerto Rico. 13 Dec 2018. (published) This study identified sexual contact as a risk factor for ZIKV infection. Persons living with ZIKV-infected individuals should be a focus of public health efforts. Of 366 contacts, 34.4 percent had evidence of ZIKV infection at enrollment, including 11.2 percent by RT-PCR. Having open doors and windows that were either screened or unscreened was associated with increased prevalence. Sexual partners were more likely to both be RT-PCR-positive relative to other relationships. At follow-up, 6.1 percent of contacts had evidence of incident infection.

Cuba. 14 Dec 2018. (published) The authors found that a large and unreported Zika outbreak occurred in Cuba during 2017, a year after peak transmission in neighboring countries, with cases still appearing in 2018. By sequencing Zika virus from infected travelers, they show that the 2017 outbreak in Cuba was sparked by long-lived lineages of Zika virus introduced from multiple places in the Americas a year prior. Their data suggest that aggressive mosquito control in Cuba may initially have been effective at mitigating Zika virus transmission.

* California. September 2018. (published). Travel-associated Zika cases in California were reviewed to assess the potential threat of local Zika virus transmission, given the regional spread of _Aedes aegypti_ and _Ae. albopictus_ mosquitoes. During November 2015-September 2017, a total of 588 travel-associated Zika cases were reported in California, including 139 infections in pregnant women, 10 congenital infections, and 8 sexually transmitted infections. Most case-patients reported travel to Mexico and Central America, and many returned during a period when they could have been viremic. By September 2017, _Ae. aegypti_ mosquitoes had spread to 124 locations in California, and _Ae. albopictus_ mosquitoes had spread to 53 locations. Continued human and mosquito surveillance and public health education are valuable tools in preventing and detecting Zika virus infections and local transmission in California.

[2] Biomarkers of fetal abnormality

ref: Foo SS, Chen W, Chan Y, et al. Biomarkers and immunoprofiles associated with fetal abnormalities of ZIKV-positive pregnancies. JCI Insight. 2018; 3(21). pii: 124152. doi: 10.1172/jci.insight.124152.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Background. An intricate fetal-maternal immune crosstalk during pregnancy is essential for a healthy birth. Hence, the infection-induced alterations of maternal immunity often lead to adverse outcomes for mother and/or child. The emergence of Zika virus (ZIKV) infection in pregnant women has been associated with more than 3000 cases of microcephaly and nervous system malformations.

Methods. To explore the potential correlation of ZIKV-induced alteration of maternal immunity with fetal abnormalities, we performed extensive sera immunoprofiling of 74 pregnant women: 30 symptomatic ZIKV+ pregnant patients and 30 healthy pregnant controls in ZIKV-endemic Rio de Janeiro, along with 14 healthy pregnant controls in non-endemic Los Angeles.

Results. Extensive multiplexing analysis of 69 cytokines revealed that CXCL10, CCL2, and CCL8 chemokines were specifically associated with symptomatic ZIKV+ infection during pregnancy, and distinct immunoprofiles were detected at different trimesters in ZIKV-infected pregnant women. Intriguingly, the high CCL2 level and its inverse correlation with CD163, TNFRSF1A, and CCL22 levels was apparently associated with ZIKV-induced abnormal birth.

Conclusion. Our findings provide insights into the alteration of ZIKV-elicited maternal immunity, serving as a potential clinical biomarker platform.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Background. North-eastern Brazil was the region most affected by the outbreak of congenital Zika syndrome that followed the 2015 Zika virus (ZIKV) epidemics, with thousands of suspected microcephaly cases reported to the health authorities, mostly between late 2015 and early 2016. Aim: To describe clinical and epidemiological aspects of the outbreak of congenital brain abnormalities (CBAs) and to evaluate the accuracy of different head circumference screening criteria in predicting CBAs.

Method. Between April 2015 and July 2016, the Centers for Information and Epidemiologic Surveillance of Salvador, Brazil investigated the reported cases suspected of microcephaly and, based on intracranial imaging studies, confirmed or excluded a diagnosis of CBA. Sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative predictive values of different head circumference screening criteria in predicting CBAs were calculated.

Results. Of the 365 investigated cases, 166 (45.5 percent) had confirmed CBAs. The most common findings were intracranial calcifications and ventriculomegaly in 143 (86.1 percent) and 111 (66.9 percent) of the 166 CBA cases, respectively. Prevalence of CBAs peaked in December 2015 (2.24 cases/100 live births). Cases of CBAs were significantly more likely to have been born preterm and to mothers who had clinical manifestations of arboviral infection during pregnancy. None of the head circumference screening criteria performed optimally in predicting CBAs.

Conclusion. This study highlights the magnitude of neurological consequences of the ZIKV epidemic and the limitations of head circumference in accurately identifying children with CBA. Gestational symptoms compatible with ZIKV infection should be combined with imaging studies for efficient detection of suspect CBAs during ZIKV epidemics.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Highlights
- Cross-reactive DENV antibodies enhance ZIKV infection in human Hofbauer cells
- Enhanced ZIKV infection in mid-gestation explants is IgG subclass dependent
- ZIKV immune complexes target Hofbauer cells within the villous stroma

Summary
Zika virus (ZIKV), which emerged in regions endemic to dengue virus (DENV), is vertically transmitted and results in adverse pregnancy outcomes. Antibodies to DENV can cross-react with ZIKV, but whether these antibodies influence ZIKV vertical transmission remains unclear. Here, we find that DENV antibodies increase ZIKV infection of placental macrophages (Hofbauer cells [HCs]) from 10 percent to over 80 percent and enhance infection of human placental explants. ZIKV-anti-DENV antibody complexes increase viral binding and entry into HCs but also result in blunted type I interferon, pro-inflammatory cytokine, and antiviral responses. Additionally, ZIKV infection of HCs and human placental explants is enhanced in an immunoglobulin G subclass-dependent manner and targeting FcRn reduces ZIKV replication in human placental explants. Collectively, these findings support a role for pre-existing DENV antibodies in enhancement of ZIKV infection of select placental cell types and indicate that pre-existing immunity to DENV should be considered when addressing ZIKV vertical transmission.

Zika virus may cause hormone deficiencies that could lead to irreversible growth delay and memory impairment, a recent study by Chinese scientists has shown.

Zika virus infection during pregnancy is widely known for causing infants to be born with brain abnormalities such as microcephaly and other malformations. However, its effects on body growth, as well as the development of children with Zika virus infection after birth, are largely unknown.

Researchers from Beijing-based Capital Medical University found that Zika virus infection in mouse pups caused damage to the hypothalamus, a center that regulates the endocrine system, and reduced the production of many hormones that are crucial for body growth and development.

The experiment showed that body weight, length, and bone density of the infected mice were significantly lower than those of normal mice. The learning abilities and spatial memory of the infected mice were also damaged.

According to Wang Peigang, one of the researchers, when the mouse pups were infected with Zika virus at birth, they suffered from dwarfism, growing slower than usual and maintaining a shorter body length through to adulthood.

"The good news is we found that growth hormone treatment could partially cure growth delay if it is administrated early," Wang said.

An Jing, another researcher, said long-term multidisciplinary follow-ups of Zika virus-infected infants and children is necessary.

"Unlike microcephaly, growth delay can't be noticed immediately when the baby is born. It takes time to appear and sometimes can be overlooked," An said.

The research on the potential impact of Zika virus on childhood development, which was published in the journal Cell Reports, will provide important references for future health policies.

[Because this is in a report by the popular press and not a scientific, peer-reviewed article, key information such as the strain of mice and clade of Zika virus used are not given. One cannot judge how good a model this is for human neonatal Zika virus infections. However, the hypothalamic damage with resulting effect on neonatal growth and development are things that clinicians practicing in areas of Zika virus transmission should watch for. - Mod.TY]

ref: van der Linden V, de Lima Petribu NC, Pessoa A, et al. Association of severe hydrocephalus with congenital Zika syndrome. JAMA Neurol. 2018. doi: 10.1001/jamaneurol.2018.3553.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Key points
----------
Question: Can hydrocephalus be part of the clinical spectrum of congenital Zika syndrome?

Findings: This case series describes 24 patients who developed hydrocephalus between 3 and 18 months of age and had at least 1 test positive for anti-Zika antibodies, including 14 who had symptoms and signs suggestive of hydrocephalus, 18 who had cerebellar or brainstem hypoplasia at baseline, and 2 who had no such symptoms but were found to have reduced brain volume on repeated imaging; at a 2nd computed tomographic scan, all showed marked increases of ventricular volume and reduction of brain tissue.

Meaning: Hydrocephalus may be a complication of congenital Zika syndrome with presenting signs and symptoms that are challenging to recognize; monitoring for it, including assessing the potential harbinger of cerebellar or brainstem hypoplasia, should be part of the standard care of patients with this condition.

Abstract
--------
Importance: Hydrocephalus is a treatable but potentially fatal complication that has not been previously described in congenial Zika syndrome (CZS).

Objective: To describe the clinical features and imaging findings in 24 patients with congenital Zika syndrome (CZS) who developed hydrocephalus.

Design, setting, and participants: This case series included patients with hydrocephalus who were born in October and November 2015 and followed up until mid-2017 in the 2 largest national referral centers for CZS in Brazil. The participants included consecutively enrolled children with a clinical and laboratorial diagnosis of CZS who developed clinical and/or image findings suggestive of hydrocephalus and who were confirmed to experience increased intracranial hypertension during ventriculoperitoneal shunt procedures.

Main outcomes and measures: To retrospectively describe clinical and image findings in these 24 patients.

Results: This multicenter cohort included 308 patients with CZS; 24 consecutive children were enrolled in this study. These children were aged between 3 to 18 months, and 13 of 24 (54 percent) were female. All patients presented with at least 1 positive test result for anti-Zika antibodies in cerebrospinal fluid or serum and had classic signs of CZS. At the time of hydrocephalus diagnosis, only 14 of 24 patients (58 percent) had symptoms and signs suggestive of hydrocephalus (mainly worsening seizures, vomiting, irritability, and/or sudden increase of head circumference percentile). Of 24 patients, 2 (8 percent) had no symptoms suggestive of hydrocephalus but were found to have reduced brain volume on repeated imaging. Cerebellar or brainstem hypoplasia on baseline imaging were found in 18 of 23 patients (78 percent). At the 2nd computed tomographic scan, all patients showed a marked increase of ventricular volume, compatible with communicating hydrocephalus, and reduction of brain tissue that was visibly worse than on baseline imaging for the 23 patients with repeated scans.

Conclusions and relevance: We present evidence that hydrocephalus is a complication of CZS in at least a proportion of patients. The clinical spectrum of this condition continues to evolve, but given that presenting signs and symptoms of hydrocephalus can be challenging to recognize in CZS, we provisionally recommend that high suspicion and appropriate monitoring for hydrocephalus should be part of the standard care of patients with CZS.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Key points
----------
Question: What does magnetic resonance imaging add to ultrasonography for detecting Zika-virus related brain lesions?

Findings: In this cohort study of 82 pregnant women with Zika virus infection, 3 cases of severe fetal brain abnormalities were detected by
magnetic resonance imaging; in 2 of these, ultrasonography results were abnormal. In neonates, cranial ultrasonography and brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed new relatively mild findings in 23 of 61 infants; most abnormalities were seen on ultrasonography.

Meaning: Although the combination of prenatal and postnatal ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging is needed to capture the full spectrum of Zika-virus related brain injury, ultrasonography detected most abnormal cases.

Abstract
--------
Importance: The evolution of fetal brain injury by Zika virus (ZIKV) infection is not well described.

Objectives: To perform longitudinal neuroimaging of fetuses and infants exposed to in utero maternal ZIKV infection using concomitant magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasonography (US), as well as to determine the duration of viremia in pregnant women with ZIKV infection and whether the duration of viremia correlated with fetal and/or infant brain abnormalities.

Design, setting, and participants: A cohort of 82 pregnant women with clinical criteria for probable ZIKV infection in Barranquilla, Colombia, and Washington, DC, were enrolled from 15 Jun 2016, through 27 Jun 2017, with Colombian women identified by community recruitment and physician referral and travel-related cases of American women recruited from a Congenital Zika Program.

Interventions and exposures: Women received 1 or more MRI and US examinations during the 2nd and/or 3rd trimesters. Postnatally, infants underwent brain MRI and cranial US. Blood samples were tested for ZIKV.

Main outcomes and measures: The neuroimaging studies were evaluated for brain injury and cerebral biometry.

Results: Of the 82 women, 80 were from Colombia and 2 were from the United States. In 3 of 82 cases (4 percent), fetal MRI demonstrated abnormalities consistent with congenital ZIKV infection. [Of these] 2 cases had heterotopias and malformations in cortical development and 1 case had a parietal encephalocele, Chiari II malformation, and microcephaly. In 1 case, US results remained normal despite fetal abnormalities detected on MRI. Prolonged maternal polymerase chain reaction positivity was present in 1 case. Of the remaining 79 cases with normal results of prenatal imaging, postnatal brain MRI was acquired in 53 infants and demonstrated mild abnormalities in 7 (13 percent). Of these infants, 57 underwent postnatal cranial US, which detected changes of lenticulostriate vasculopathy, choroid plexus cysts, germinolytic/subependymal cysts, and/or calcification in 21 infants (37 percent).

Conclusions and relevance: In a cohort of pregnant women with ZIKV infection, prenatal US examination appeared to detect all but 1 abnormal fetal case. Postnatal neuroimaging in infants who had normal prenatal imaging revealed new mild abnormalities. For most patients, prenatal and postnatal US may identify ZIKV-related brain injury.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
During the Zika virus (ZIKV) epidemic in Rio de Janeiro from September 2015 through June 2016, a prospective cohort study involving symptomatic pregnant women who had ZIKV infection confirmed by reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction assay was established.

A total of 182 children who were exposed to ZIKV in utero were followed longitudinally with specialized attention. Of these children, 131 (72 percent) were brought by their parents for at least one of the following evaluations: brain imaging (in 115 children), complete eye examinations (in 112), assessment with the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, and assessment of brain-stem auditory evoked response (in 49).

A total of 94 children underwent both Bayley-III and neuroimaging assessments. Abnormal findings on neuroimaging were identified in 39 of 115 children (34 percent) overall and in 35 of 94 children (37 percent) who also underwent neuropsychological testing. Among 94 children who underwent both neuroimaging and Bayley-III testing, neuroradiologists found that 10 (11 percent) had structural abnormalities, 5 (5 percent) had nonstructural abnormalities, and 20 (21 percent) had abnormal results that were limited to a nonspecific T2-weighted hypersignal on MRI.

Children with normal brain imaging were 20 percent less likely to have a Bayley-III score that was 2 SD below the mean (plus/minus SD) score than those with abnormal brain imaging (odds ratio, 0.80, 95 percent confidence interval, 0.70 to 0.91). Among children with abnormal findings on brain imaging, 7 of 112 (6 percent) had an abnormal eye examination and 6 of 49 (12 percent) had an abnormal hearing assessment. Among 131 children who were exposed to ZIKV in utero and who underwent imaging, neurodevelopmental assessment, sensory organ assessment, or all of these tests, 19 (14 percent) were found to have severe neurodevelopmental delay (2 SD below the mean [plus/minus SD] score), sensory organ dysfunction, or both; this rate is higher than that reported in previous studies. Although a significant association was noted between normal results on brain imaging and higher Bayley-III scores, neuroimaging did not predict developmental delay in 2 percent of children and normal development in 16 percent of children.

[9] Importance of published virus sequences

Publishing epidemic data on open access platforms can help countries tackle outbreaks better. Neither Rajasthan, which saw 154 cases, nor Madya Pradesh [MP], which saw 127, published the day-wise numbers of confirmed infections. The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has genetically sequenced Zika viruses from 5 patients in Rajasthan but has not published these sequences in any open access databases such as GenBank.

Both daily case counts and genetic sequences of the viruses circulating in India can be extremely useful to epidemiologists studying Zika [virus outbreaks]. Daily case counts can show how quickly the virus is spreading. Genetic sequences can help us understand from where the virus came to India and for how long it had been circulating in Rajasthan and MP before it was detected. Using data from previous epidemics, scientists have been able to estimate the rate at which the Zika virus mutates. So, by comparing genome sequences from multiple patients, they can estimate when these viruses diverged from their most recent common ancestor, giving an idea of when the virus entered India. If this date is much earlier than the date of the 1st detected case (September [2018] in Rajasthan), that would mean a larger number of patients were infected, which in turn could help customise our outbreak response.

The ICMR has only announced that the Rajasthan Zika strain is genetically close to the Brazilian strain (suggesting that the virus came from Latin America), and that it does not have certain mutations. "Genetically close" is a broad term, and without the sequence information, other researchers cannot independently interpret and validate ICMR's claims. ICMR says it has submitted the data to a peer-reviewed journal for publication, but publication in journals takes longer than publication in an open access database.

Given how important such data are during epidemics, the World Health Organisation (WHO) released a policy statement in 2016 saying "pathogen genome sequences be made publicly available as rapidly as possible through relevant databases." West Africa's 2013 Ebola virus outbreak and Latin America's 2015 Zika outbreak showed how useful such proactive sharing can be -- during the Ebola epidemic, around 80 percent of the epidemiological modelling studies used only open data, according to a 2016 PLOS Medicine paper.

There are reasons why researchers are often reluctant to share genome sequences. During the Ebola outbreak, some scientists were worried that they may not be credited for their work if someone else published an analysis based on their sequences and waited for months before publishing. Such concerns are valid, and the WHO says it is important to address this. But given the benefits to public health from data-sharing, Indian authorities should do their part too.

[Sharing sequence data is important for the reasons mentioned above. One hopes that these Zika virus sequences will soon be deposited in an open data base such as GenBank. - Mod.TY]
