Use of Sentinel Chickens as an Early-warning System Abandoned
-------------------------------------------------------------
Canadian health officials have abandoned the use of sentinel chickens as an
early warning system along areas of the Canada-U.S. border. "We've opted
not to use them because we don't feel they are effective," says Dr. Maureen
Baikie, Nova Scotia's Associate Provincial Medical Officer Of Health. West
Nile virus has appeared in 12 northeastern states of the United States but
hasn't been detected in Canada. It can be transmitted to humans by
mosquitoes that have fed on the blood of birds, which carry the virus. In
rare cases, the virus can cause serious illness or death in humans.
Last year, up to 600 sentinel chickens were placed in strategic areas near
the border, including New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, and were tested
regularly to see whether they'd contracted the virus. But this year,
officials have decided against relying on these birds as an early warning
system after U.S. health officials determined their sentinel chickens
failed to contract the virus, even in areas where wild birds were infected,
said Dr. Baikie, who sits on a provincial West Nile virus working group and
participates in national meetings on the disease. "In the United States,
they had sentinel chickens and they also had dead-bird surveillance and
mosquito surveillance. What they found is that in areas where they had dead
[virus-infected wild birds they didn't necessarily have virus-positive
chickens," said Dr. Baikie.
This year, provincial and federal surveillance teams will concentrate on
collecting and testing dead [wild birds for the virus. Birds of the corvid
family such as crows, blue jays, and ravens often die when they contract
the virus, said Dr. Harvey Artsob of Health Canada's National Microbiology
Laboratory in Winnipeg. This year, the lab hopes to test more than the 2200
dead [wild birds that it tested last year for the virus. In the next few
weeks, provinces will issue notices asking the public to contact wildlife
officials when they spot a dead bird. "Dead birds seem to be a good early
warning system. [in the United States in the areas where there were human
cases, without exception they found dead [wild birds with West Nile virus
well in advance of the human cases," Dr. Artsob said. Since only certain
[species of mosquito carry the virus, provinces will also begin mosquito
surveillance this spring.[Species of the genus _Culex_, which can carry
the virus, are known to be in Nova Scotia, Dr. Baikie said.
Provincial health departments also plan to notify family and emergency
physicians in coming weeks to be on alert for signs of the virus in
patients, Dr. Baikie said. Most people with the disease show no symptoms or
have mild flu-like symptoms. However, in rare cases the virus can cause
meningitis (inflammation of the lining of the brain) or encephalitis
(inflammation of the brain). The virus first appeared in the New York City
area in 1999, causing 62 confirmed cases and 7 deaths. It reappeared in
2000 in 12 states, causing 21 confirmed cases and 2 deaths.
