State health officials are investigating the cause of stomach illnesses
related to the consumption of Spam musubis [see comment for explanation] on
Maui. Since Jul 2006, 9 people have become ill probably from food
poisoning associated with Spam musubis sold at 4 stores in Central Maui,
officials said yesterday, 24 Aug 2006.
Most of the ill have been children, ranging from ages 3 to 9, and 2 of them
received emergency medical care, officials said. Lorie Whitsett, a state
epidemiologist, said none of the 9 required hospitalization. Whitsett said
there appears to be no connection concerning food preparation at the 4 food
establishments.
State officials said consumer mishandling of Spam, such as holding it
without refrigeration for too long, could be the cause of some of the
illnesses. Health officials said Spam musubi and other similar bento food
in stores are highly perishable and should be kept at safe temperatures,
either hot at 140 degrees Fahrenheit and above, or cold at 45 degrees
Fahrenheit or below. Health inspectors are conducting an investigation of
retail and production establishments on Maui and also doing random visits
on retailers to check if time and temperature requirements are being met.
For instance, if Spam musubi is put on the counter at room temperature, it
should contain an end time and date for consumption, Whitsett said.
Whitsett said under state law, Spam musubi at room temperature has a 4-hour
consumption span, after which it should be discarded.
Health officials said refrigerating Spam musubi after purchase is not
recommended because the product has already been held at unsafe
temperatures, and bacteria, if present, could begin to multiply and cause
illnesses.
In November 2005, 7 people suffered from food poisoning from Spam musubis
purchased at 3 locations in Central Maui, health officials said.

[Not enough information is given to assess the etiology of the illness. The
incubation period, presence or absence of fever, symptoms, and length of
illness can assist in distinguishing toxin from viral from bacterial disease.
The following information on Spam musubis and Spam itself is extracted from
<http://whatscookingamerica.net/History/Spam.htm>:
The Hormel Company, in Austin, Minnesota, USA, developed America's 1st
canned ham in 1926. After the hams were cut, the company was left with
thousands of pounds of nearly worthless pork shoulder. Jay C. Hormel, son
of Hormel founder George A. Hormel, developed the ideas of using the pork
shoulder in a new product called "Hormel Spiced Ham." Since the name was
rather uninspiring, a contest was held at a New Year's Eve party for a new
name with a $100 prize to the winner. The winning name was the name it goes
by today: Spam. Kenneth Daigneau, an actor and the brother of a Hormel vice
president Ralph Daigneau, won the contest.
During World War II, sales of Spam soared. In part because it requires no
refrigeration [while canned - Mod.LL], Spam was perfect for the military
and became a standard K-ration for U.S. soldiers. Military personnel
introduced it in Hawaii and elsewhere.
A favorite Hawaiian way to eat Spam is in the form of a musubi (pronounced
moo-soo-bee). It is a fried slice of Spam on rice pressed together to form
a small block, then wrapped with a strip of seaweed. A special kitchen
gadget, known as the Spam Musubi Maker, is responsible for the
proliferation of this treat. It is a special plexiglas mold with the
outline of a single Spam slice. The Spam musubi is eaten as a sandwich, and
it is perhaps the Island's favorite "to go" or snack food. Spam musubi is
literally everywhere in Hawaii, including local convenience stores, grocery
stores, school cafeterias, and even at the zoo. Eating a Spam musubi seems
to serve as a rite of passage for newcomers anxious to attain "local"
status. A picture of the delicacy can be found at:

The term "foodborne illness" in the title line will be used to place "food
poisoning," since the CDC has been using the former term for a number of
years. This was suggested by Dr. David E. Dassey from Communicable Disease
Control in Los Angeles <ddassey@ladhs.org>.
