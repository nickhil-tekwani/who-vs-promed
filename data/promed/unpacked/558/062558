I asked Dr. Zack Pretorius (UOVS, Bloemfontein, RSA) if there had been any
recurrence of the Sr31 pathotype in the wheat plots and he replied as follows:
"I have asked several wheat scientists working in central and eastern
Africa about the new rust pathotype. Apparently no one has seen any
outbreaks on Sr31 genotypes since the original detection in Feb 1999. This
year wheat plots in Uganda were infected with stripe rust, again
emphasizing the seasonal nature of the cereal rusts."

Dr. Alan Reolfs, former USDA plant pathologist, provided the following
edited comment regarding the occurrence of Sr31:
Sr31 is not wide spread in all bread wheat cultivars of recent origin, with
the exception of the USA and Canada programs. In Europe, it is in the
winter wheats through the Russian cultivars 'Kavkaz', and 'Aurora',
Romanian Loverin's, and world wide in spring wheats derived from the CIMMYT
crosses Verry, and Bobwhite. Clement was a western European wheat with the
1R translocation.
In Europe, stripe rust resistance was important, and at CIMMYT high yield
and rust resistance were important factors. Alondra grown in Brazil had
resistance to aluminum toxicity which added to it use as a parent. In the
USA the 1B/1R translocation has had less use because of the milling
quality, but Siouxland from Nebraska was grown on some acreage. Australia
has a lot of local wheat without the 1R but they currently use CIMMYT
germplasm in many of the breeding programs. Wheat cultivars sent to us from
China have had the 1R translocation but I am unsure of the acreage. Turkey
also grows significant wheat and CIMMYT would be the best source for
information on the amount with 1R. Because wheat with the 1B/1R
translocation generally are much higher yielding than the older normal
wheats acreage is not a real measure of the importance of the translocation
in the production figures.

Dr. Don Harder, a former research scientist of the Research Branch of
Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, has provided an assessment of the
likelihood of Sr31 spreading from wheat selections in Uganda to other
locations: <http://res2.agr.ca/winnipeg/rust.htm>
A list of wheat cultivars containing the Sr31 gene and their origins is
given in the following web site:
<http://www.cdl.umn.edu/Special_Rpts/Sr31vir/Sr31_cvs.html>
Please note that these data simply indicate the cultivar name and its
origin. They cannot be used to indicate acreages planted.
