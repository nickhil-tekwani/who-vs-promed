The reemergence of H7N9 [avian influenza virus] in China during the past month has reinforced the [potential] need for a vaccine. Candidates from Chinese and Taiwanese manufacturers have grabbed the headlines recently [see: Avian influenza, human (129): China, H7N9 vaccine work 20131027.2023660], but now a U.S. player, Novavax (SNVAX), has joined the race with positive Phase I data.

Novavax reported a summary of the results in a letter to The New England Journal of Medicine [see part [2] below: A recombinant viruslike particle influenza A (H7N9) vaccine 13 Nov 2013, DOI: 10.1056/NEJMc1313186]. The trial enrolled 284 people in Australia and gave them a placebo or one of 6 H7N9 vaccine formulations. Based on the antibody responses, Novavax thinks 2 shots of 5ug of antigen will protect 4 in 5 people when given with 60 ISCO units of CSL's Iscomatrix adjuvant. Higher antigen doses were given without the adjuvant, but using smaller quantities increases the number of available vaccines.

In a pandemic situation, when manufacturing can be a bottleneck, this is important, and observers are encouraged by the data. "These are very preliminary results, but it appears for the 1st time that we may have a vaccine that would work against an outbreak [of avian flu]. This is a very important milestone. We have a promising vaccine where before we had none," Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) director Robin Robinson told Reuters News Agency.

Novavax expects to start a US clinical trial of its H7N9 vaccine in the 1st half of next year [2014]. A trial of Sanofi's ($SNY) H7N9 vaccine in conjunction with adjuvants from GlaxoSmithKline ($GSK) and Novartis ($NVS) is already under way.

Letter: A recombinant viruslike particle influenza A (H7N9) vaccine. Louis F Fries, Gale E Smith, Gregory M Glenn.

Avian-origin influenza A (H7N9) viruses emerged as human pathogens in China in 2013 and have caused 137 cases and 45 deaths to date. These viruses have acquired mutations that could facilitate infection in mammals, which could pose a pandemic threat if the viruses become readily transmissible in humans. Vaccines are a key defense against pandemics, but candidate vaccines featuring H7 hemagglutinins (HA) have been poorly immunogenic.

We have previously described the development, manufacture, and efficacy in mice of an A/Anhui/1/13 (H7N9) viruslike particle (VLP) vaccine produced in insect cells with the use of recombinant baculovirus. This vaccine combines the HA and neuraminidase (NA) of A/Anhui/1/13 with the matrix 1 protein (M1) of A/Indonesia/5/05. We enrolled 284 adults (18 years of age or older) in a randomized, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial of this vaccine; all the participants provided written informed consent. The trial was approved by the Bellberry Human Research Ethics Committee in Adelaide, Australia. Study participants received 2 identical doses, 21 days apart, of placebo, vaccine alone at doses delivering 15 ug or 45 ug of HA, or vaccine at doses delivering 5 ug or 15 ug of HA combined with 30 or 60 units of the saponin-based ISCOMATRIX adjuvant. A total of 37 participants (13 per cent) were excluded from the per-protocol analysis before unblinding because of protocol violations.

The VLP vaccine with adjuvant was associated with increased local and systemic reactions. Few of these reactions were severe, and no body temperatures exceeded 38.5 C [101.3 F]. The sole serious adverse event was a recurrence of a previous illness). By day 35, after immunizations at day 0 and day 21, seroconversion and hemagglutination-inhibition (HAI) reciprocal antibody titers of 40 or more (the value cited by regulatory authorities as having a potential association with clinical benefit) were detected in 5.7 per cent and 15.6 per cent of participants receiving 15 ug and 45 ug of HA, respectively, without adjuvant. In contrast, 3 of the 4 treatment groups receiving VLPs with adjuvant had HAI seroconversion and reciprocal titers of 40 or more in more than 60 percent of participants, including 80.6 per cent of those receiving 5 ug of HA with 60 units of adjuvant.

Significant increases in N9 neuraminidase-inhibiting antibodies occurred in up to 71.9 per cent of recipients of the vaccine without adjuvant, 92.0 per cent of recipients of vaccine with 30 units of adjuvant, and 97.2 per cent of recipients of vaccine with 60 units of adjuvant. The vaccines that were studied here were released for human use within 3 months after the availability of the HA and NA sequences.

[This NEJM letter reports encouraging results in development of a vaccine to combat avian H7N9 virus infection in humans, which appears to be well tolerated and able to induce potentially protective immune responses to H7N9 avian influenza virus infection, in the presence of a compatible adjuvant. A particular advantage is the potential to propagate the vaccine in the form of VLP (virus-like particles ) in insect cells.

At present, there has been no unequivocal evidence of human-to-human transmission of avian H7N9 influenza virus, which allows the Novartis vaccine developers more time to develop this potential vaccine. - Mod.CP]
