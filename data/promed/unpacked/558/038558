When an exclusive private school suddenly extends its Easter break, it might be a good time to check with social media to see if, in fact, an outbreak of foodborne illness has occurred. That appears to be what has happened with Louisiana's Silliman Institute, where the original schedule for the term shows Easter break not beginning until today, 2 Apr 2015. However, Silliman sent students home last Friday, 27 Mar 2015, resumed classes Monday, 30 Mar 2015 and then called it quits until Monday, 6 Apr 2015. What gives? Silliman isn't talking and the answer is hard to find because Louisiana's Napoleonic Code is not about sunshine in government.

"There is an outbreak of STEC (Shiga toxin-producing _Escherichia coli_ [also called enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ or EHEC - Mod.LL]) in a school in Region 2 and it is being investigated," Ashley Lewis, spokeswoman for Louisiana's Department of Health and Hospitals, told Food Safety News. "As the investigation progresses, the Department continues to take all necessary preventive measures to protect public health," Lewis noted, adding, "Louisiana law prohibits the disclosure of the content of epidemiological investigations except to the institutions concerned. The Department would also clarify that any decisions related to facility closure have been made by the facilities themselves."

The answer about an apparent outbreak of _E. coli_ O157:H7 appears to come from a Facebook group known to its members as HUS moms. They were 1st to report on a Clinton, Louisiana, school closure. The school opened and closed again. The 1st child sickened in the Louisiana outbreak, a girl, was reportedly hospitalized with the kidney disease known as hemolytic-uremic syndrome, or HUS. The 2nd child, also hospitalized but without HUS, was not being held in a pediatric intensive care unit and was likely going to avoid kidney dialysis. None of this was being shared, however, with the parents and students of Silliman Institute. The administration was getting the word out about the newly extended Easter break with a red-letter announcement on the school's website, but not explaining why.

The announcement states: "Silliman is closed Tuesday, 31 Mar 2015, and Wednesday, 1 Apr 2015, to extend the Easter break that is scheduled for Thursday, 2 Apr 2015, through Monday, 6 Apr 2015. We will resume regular schedule Tuesday, 7 Apr 2015, unless otherwise notified."

Silliman is a non-sectarian private school with a history that dates back 150 years. With about 500 students, it offers classes from pre-kindergarten through 12th grade.

[There is little information in this posting to characterize the pathotype of _E. coli_, but given the illnesses, as stated, it is likely to be an enterohemorrhagic one, the prototypic strain in this group being O157:H7. ProMED awaits more information regarding the organism, the clinical illnesses and presumed reservoir, whether food, water or animal exposure. It is interesting that the only media sites found to mention the cluster of 2 cases were legal related. - Mod.LL

The story also illustrates the use of social media in outbreak investigation. - Mod.LM
