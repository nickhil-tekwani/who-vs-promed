FMD strain catches Russia's Khabarovsk territory unprepared
-----------------------------------------------
Russia's Khabarovsk territory, together with neighboring regions, found
itself helpless against the attack of foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] virus
type Asia-1, officials said on Friday [26 Aug 2005].
The federal center did not allocate the required vaccines in time, said the
crisis commission, which reviewed a range of emergency measures to localize
the outbreak of the dangerous infection.
On Friday [26 Aug 2005], Khabarovsk was expected to receive 180 000 doses
of the vaccine from Moscow.
The local veterinary services failed to obtain the vaccine against the
Asia-1 serotype during the cattle inoculation in the spring. The
vaccination, therefore, was carried out against other types of the FMD
virus, but animals were helpless before the Asia-1 virus.
It was the Asia-1 strain that infected cattle in the village of Busse, Amur
region. The Maritime territory received vaccine after the infection as well.
The crisis commission had to decide on slaughtering all the 106 cattle at
the Lermontovskoye agribusiness in the Khabarovsk territory's Bikin
district. The cadavers will be burnt and buried in line with sanitary and
veterinary instructions.
The situation remains difficult, as FMD cases were reported in the villages
of Vidnoye and Sheremetyevo and other settlements of the neighboring
Vyazemsky district.

[Since 30 Jun 2005, when the Russian authorities sent to the OIE a
follow-up report on the outbreak in Busse, no additional reports have
become available.
The Asia 1 epizootic in Russia's far east seems to continue its pace; a
look at the map will reveal that this is not necessarily a spread within
Russian territory, but more probably repeated introductions from
neighboring China. Busse, where the 1st outbreak was reported in June 2005,
is situated on the Amur river, which separates Russia from China. The 3
villages in the Khabarovsk region, found infected last week, are situated
on the Ussuri river, also separating Russia from China. This area is more
than 1000 km distant (southeast) from Busse. The new outbreak, reported on
26 Aug 2005 in the Primorskiy region, also borders China, about 700 km
south of the foci in Khabarovsk.
According to an analysis by the FAO (June 2005, following the Amur
outbreak), countries bordering China to the south and east could be
considered at risk of Asia 1 on a geographical basis. Indeed, outbreaks
have been recorded in Mongolia and Myanmar. Unless drastic and efficient
control activities are immediately applied in China, additional
introductions of the virus to other countries might be expected along her
borders. The further spread, observed since June 2005, prescribes the need
for increased alertness in the region, including consideration of the need
to apply mass vaccinations against serotype Asia 1. - Mod.AS]
