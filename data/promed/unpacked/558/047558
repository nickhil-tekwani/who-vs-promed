[Both Dengue and Chikungunya are vector borne diseases which are essentially endemic to Sindh and other provinces. Aedes Aegypti and Aedes Albopictus are the principal mosquito vectors that are quite widespread. Therefore there is need to develop medium and long term vector management programs to control both these diseases and their associated impact on the health systems year after year. - Mod.UBA
