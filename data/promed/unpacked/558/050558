Infectious bacterial disease _Mycoplasma bovis_ has been discovered on a Pahīatua sheep and beef farm in Tararua District. It is the 2nd infection of a cattle herd in the North Island after the virus was discovered on a farm near Hastings in December [2017].

In a statement, the Ministry for Primary Industries [MPI] said the affected farm was connected to other infected properties through animal movements. Wairarapa MP Alastair Scott said MPI had blown its chance to contain the disease in the South Island and was disappointed by the toll it was likely to take on local farmers. "We've had the pea weevil outbreak in Wairarapa so we're familiar with how to lock down everything and get everyone on board and work together and make a sacrifice to make sure the peas don't get out. You'd think the same thing could be repeated with this virus [bacterium], but unfortunately MPI have let it get away on them."

In July 2017, _Mycoplasma bovis_ was found in cattle in the Oamaru area of the South Island.

The difficult-to-treat disease causes mastitis, abortion, pneumonia, and arthritis in cattle, which can carry and spread the disease for long periods. MPI is now undertaking large-scale culling operations aimed at eradicating the virus and destroying an estimated 36.5 million NZD [approx. 25.7 million USD] worth of cattle. MPI director of response Geoff Gwyn said the Pahīatua farmer had been very cooperative with movement controls and had not moved any animals off the property, except to slaughter, since even before legal restrictions were issued.

While this was the 2nd North Island detection it should not be considered a major turning point in the response, Gwyn said. "This is, in fact, just a further property uncovered through robust tracing activity. It is likely we will find further positive properties as this tracing continues. We have a number of farms in the North and South Islands under quarantine while we carry out testing. The reality of farming is that large numbers of cattle are routinely moved about the country."

The Pahīatua farm was owned and run by Landcorp. Landcorp (Pāmu) head of communications Simon King said the infection was found on their Rangedale farm. "Pāmu is working with MPI and local veterinary services and we are currently culling the impacted herd." He said they had been in touch with neighbouring properties to advise them of the potential that the farm was infected last week. They also held a community meeting on [Wed 25 Apr 2018] to update neighbours and the actions being taken.

As well as the Pahīatua property, MPI also confirmed 2 further positive properties in Southland. Gwyn said, despite speculation, there had been no positive detections in Waikato. The areas spread throughout New Zealand with infections included Canterbury, Hawke's Bay, Mid-Canterbury, South Canterbury/North Otago, and Southland.

Federated Farmers Tararua president Neil Filer said the district's farmers had watched with concern during the testing, and his phone had been ringing off the hook. "We were hoping it would turn out to be nothing ... [but] it looks like a fact of life at the moment." Flier said Rangedale was unlikely to be the only farm hit. Neighbouring farms were stepping up their biosecurity, fortifying their farms and had formed an informal support network. Filer asked the Tararua community to rally behind their neighbours, whose livelihoods could be seriously affected by the outbreak. "We're going to face some short-term pain for the long-term gain [of containing _Mycoplasma bovis_.]"

Federated Farmers and the Rural Support Trust were working closely with MPI to provide resources and financial aid to help the farmers through the outbreak.
