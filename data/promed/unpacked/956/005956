Re: [Infected birds are apparently moving west, both north and south of the
Great Lakes, and being preyed on by crows and blue jays which, if they have
not already been infected by mosquito bite will get infected through the
gut. - Mod.JW
On what evidence do you base your premise that crows will become infected
through the gut?

[On the fact that a hawk was found dead of West Nile virus [WNV infection
in winter -- February 2000 -- in the northern USA, when there were no
mosquitoes about (Garmendia AE et al. Recovery and identification of West
Nile virus from a hawk in winter. J Clin Microbiol 2000; 38(8): 3110-1).
Also, in "West Nile virus, oral infection: comment" (ProMED archive
20000316.0370) Ernest Gould <eag@ceh.ac.uk> reported infection of grouse
chicks when they ate ticks infected with louping ill virus [a flavivirus
related to WNV and said it is well known from experimental evidence (not
necessarily published), that many mosquito-transmitted flaviviruses may
infect susceptible animals by the oral route.
You could argue that it was a relapse of an infection from a summer
mosquito bite. And if it was the result of eating a sick bird or rodent,
one has to wonder how the prey, presumably infected by a summer mosquito,
survived into winter with a chronic infection. - Mod.JW

Crows (that is, the American crow, the only crow species that occurs in
Indiana), are omnivores, carrion-feeding, and prey on the weak and young,
but blue jays are not. Blue jays feed on nuts, seeds, and lesser quantities
of fruit, insects, and eggs according to an internet search on "bird blue
jay" [information written by Gregory Gough of the USGS Patuxent Wildlife
Research Center. This matches my own observations. Therefore, I believe
that the positive blue jays are due to mosquito bites rather than any
carrion-feeding tendencies.

[Other sources refer to small rodents and reptiles forming part of a blue
jay's diet; and if they eat eggs, do they deliberately avoid nestlings? -
