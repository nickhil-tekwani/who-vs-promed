The Secretariat of Health investigates the suspected yellow fever [YF] deaths of monkeys
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A team travels to the municipalities in the north of Minas [Gerais] in order to collect samples of visceral organs and blood from dead animals in the region. There are no human deaths [from YF].

A team of technicians of the state Secretariat of Health (SES) involved in surveillance of epizootics (diseases in animals) is traveling in the municipalities of Brasília de Minas, Coração de Jesus and Mirabela, in the north of Minas, in order to investigate recent primate mortality in the region. Their goal is to know if the primate mortality was caused by the virus that causes yellow fever, which could be transmitted by the phlebotomus mosquito after biting ill animals. Until now, there have not been any cases of yellow fever [in humans] in the region. [Sylvan YF is not transmitted by phlebotomus sand flies, it is transmitted by _Haemagogus_ spp. mosquitoes. - Mod.TY]

In a note, SES reported that a technical team from the epizootic surveillance unit is doing field work in the 3 municipalities since 28 Mar [2016] and will remain there until Friday [8 Apr 2016]. The number of dead monkeys was not stated.

According to SES, they are making collections of mosquitoes and dead animals (viscera and blood). The material must be sent for laboratory tests in order to confirm if there is presence of the virus that causes yellow fever.

Also, according to SES, they are carrying out routine work, following recommendations of the Ministry of Health when monkey mortality is found in specific communities of the region. "Such activity is an action of monitoring and routine surveillance of non-human primate epizootics, and is justified when mortality of these animals occurs as reported by the community in the localities in the listed municipalities. This type of surveillance response is a sentinel event in the prevention and control of diseases, among them yellow fever, routinely," according to an SES statement.

[Surveillance of epizootics is one of the principal pillars of yellow fever surveillance. When one occurs, the epizootics must be considered a potential sentinel event (suggestive of virus circulation), and, where appropriate, preceding occurrence of human cases of the disease in a specific locality, including in disturbed environments.

For this reason, actions are complex and involve investigation of the primate deaths, circulation of viruses (by means of serum surveys, for example), active searches for human cases (syndromic surveillance can be one strategy), vector control and vaccination.

YF virus is endemic in Brazil in its sylvan cycle, with the risk of human infections in the forest and subsequent spill over into urban and suburban human populations. ProMED-mail would be interested in knowing what the findings of the laboratory and field investigations are.
