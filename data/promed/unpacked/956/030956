Another case of the highly pathogenic avian influenza [HPAI] virus has been confirmed in Buan, North Jeolla Province. The provincial government said on Tuesday [28 Dec 2021] that the latest case was confirmed at a farm raising about 10 000 ducks. This is the 18th confirmed case involving poultry farms this winter and the first in the province.

The local government launched a preventive cull and ordered a movement ban on 15 poultry farms within a radius of 10 kilometers (about 6 miles) from the duck farm to prevent the spread of the virus.

[As elsewhere in Eurasia, during the previous avian influenza season, winter 2020/2021, HPAI H5N8 was the causative agent, replaced during the current season by HPAI H5N1 which continues its spread. South Korea maintains a stamping out policy. - Mod.AS]

In a modern laying hen coop, in the Moshav (cooperative village) Devorah, bird flu HPAI H5N1 has been diagnosed. The 96-week old flock includes 35 000 laying hens.

It appears that the epizootic continues its spread.

[The above new outbreak is situated close to 2 earlier outbreaks in the same region within Israel's Northern District (Hazafon), namely Ram-on, Kfar Baruch and Nahalal. If the outbreak is confirmed, it will become Israel's 11th HPAI H5N1 outbreak on poultry farms since the start of the current season in September 2021. In particular, egg-layers and turkeys have been affected.

Israel submitted its 7th follow-up report to the OIE on Wed 28 Dec 2021, adding 3 new outbreaks to the 7 reported earlier. The report, with a map, is available at https://wahis.oie.int/#/report-info?reportId=45430 and includes the following (slightly abridged) epidemiological comments: "H5N1 was diagnosed last time in Israel in 2015. October is a month during which [a major bird migration] passes over the country on their migration from Europe to Africa, including water-birds. Around the affected farms, there are some water bodies where wild birds can rest and feed. The distance between Ein Zurim and Avigedor events is about 2.5 kilometers. The outbreak in MARGALYYOT is the first outbreak in Israel that occurred in laying hens. The area near the northern border, is populated with a large number of laying hen pens."

This epizootic has involved a major event among migrating cranes, residing in the Hula valley, north Israel (see earlier postings, and https://news.in-24.com/news/446377.html). The number of dead cranes has already exceeded 5200; the affected nature reserve has been closed to the public.

The Asian countries which have reported HPAI H5N1 outbreaks during the current season are China, China (Hong Kong), India, Israel, Japan, South Korea, the Syrian Arab Republic and Iran. For more detail see FAO's last monthly report "Global AIV with Zoonotic Potential situation update" at https://bit.ly/32DPw3C. Table 1 includes more detail from the said Asian countries; a map is included. - Mod.AS
