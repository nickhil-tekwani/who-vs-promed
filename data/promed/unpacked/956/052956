Anxious watch over vet staff in virus outbreak
----------------------------------------------
The owner of a Brisbane veterinary clinic is anxiously waiting to see if
more of his staff have contracted the potentially fatal Hendra virus. A
nurse and a veterinarian at the Redlands Veterinary Clinic were diagnosed
with the virus after treating several infected horses. Owner Dr David
Lovell said if no more staff were diagnosed this weekend [19-20 Jul 2008],
the worst of the crisis should be over. "If we get through this weekend I
get the feeling we will be on the road to recovery," Lovell said. "The
anticipated maximum incubation period is 14 days and certainly by Tuesday
[22 Jul 2008] there would be absolutely no chance of there being a human or
horse being exposed or infected because everything would have been shut
down and secured for that time."

Lovell said staff had visited the nurse and veterinarian Ben Cunneen in the
Princess Alexandra Hospital. "They are no way near being cured but it just
means they are not deteriorating and that has to be some cause for
optimism. But this is not detracting one bit from the seriousness of the
condition."

The veterinarian of 38 years has closed his horse practice during the
crisis as 8 other staff who worked closely with affected horses are
monitored to see if they are incubating the bug. One of the horses was put
down, another died and a 3rd is recovering. Lovell said those horses showed
signs of neurological damage such as a staggered gait and falling over.

Cunneen and the nurse suffered flu-like symptoms from the virus, which
claimed the life of trainer Vic Rail and 14 horses during the last outbreak
in 1994. Brisbane Southside Population Health Unit medical officer Dr Brad
McCall said the affected pair would have acquired the infection through
close contact with the horses in the late stage of illness or at autopsy.
There had been no evidence of person to person transmission of the virus
and no risk to the wider community.

Queensland Health continues to monitor 7 people in Proserpine, north
Queensland, who have undergone blood tests following a 2nd outbreak of the
virus. A virus-affected horse died late last week at a Cannonvale property.

[The 1st human case of Hendra virus infection in the outbreak affecting
horses at the Redlands Veterinary Clinic in Brisbane was reported on 15 Jul
2008. Now a 2nd person working at the Redlands Veterinary Clinic has been
hospitalised with Hendra virus infection. The condition of these 2 patients
appears to be serious but not life-threatening.
