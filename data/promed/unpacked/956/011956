This comment is sent in response to the ProMED-mail request for
relevant information on causative agents for the Nicaragua and/or
Honduras outbreaks of pneumonia [see: Pneumonia - Nicaragua,
Honduras: alert RFI 20080817.2550].

I recently returned from Nicaragua while on a medical mission trip
(VIMM) [Volunteers in Medical Missions] from 2 to 9 Aug 2008 and our
group treated and evaluated 1015 people near the Nicaraguan/Honduran
boarder. We saw many children and mothers with chief complaints of
URIs [upper respiratory tract infections] and viral like symptoms
[febrile illness?]. We had no ability to do laboratory testing.

Very few cases were empirically diagnosed with pneumonia. Only one
child was taken to the hospital by our group for moderate dehydration.

[Dr. Scott's observations are consistent with the 2nd report from
Nicaragua (see below) indicating that most of the cases are thought
to be due to influenza A H1 virus or respiratory syncytial virus
infection. It is clear that in the original report the term
'pneumonia' is being used broadly as indicative of respiratory tract
infection, rather than in its strict definition as infection of the
small air sacs of the lungs (alveoli) and the tissues around them.
