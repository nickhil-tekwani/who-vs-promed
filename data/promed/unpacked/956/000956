Measles Outbreak Claims 70
------------------------------------
A suspected fresh measles outbreak has hit some parts of the country
[of Zimbabwe], reportedly killing about 70 children over a 2-week
period. Health officials yesterday [22 Sep 2010] confirmed that 24
children died of measles in Chiweshe in Mazowe District, while
traditional leaders and officials from the district administrator's
office covering some parts of remote Mbire area recorded 40 deaths in
Mashonaland Central.

Epidemiology and disease control director in the Ministry of Health
and Child Welfare Dr Portia Manangazira yesterday confirmed the
outbreaks reported in Mudzerengi Village in Mbire District and the
Chiweshe area. "We noted a significant decline in the measles cases
as early as 2 weeks post-campaign (the national immunisation campaign
held in May 2010). "There are, however, areas that have continued to
report cases of measles since the start of the outbreak because the
communities have continued to evade health authorities. "The
persistent refusal by some segments of society means these closed
communities have large numbers of unvaccinated children," Dr Manangazira said.

She said a number of factors could have contributed to the recurrence
of measles, chief among them the general decline in routine
immunisation and persistent refusal by some people. "Of note is the
Madida sect of Matabeleland South Province and apostolic sects in
Mazowe District of Mashonaland Central who chased away the campaign
teams. "In fact, in these areas by the time of the post-campaign
coverage surveys, they were already having outbreaks," Dr Manangazira said.

She said the provincial medical directorate for Mashona-land Central
had already dispatched a team to Mazowe and Mbire to respond to the
crisis. However, Mashonaland Central Governor and Resident Minister
Advocate Martin Dinha last Friday [17 Sep 2010] expressed
disappointment over the health officials' response to the outbreak.

"We started receiving reports of deaths due to the suspected measles
outbreak on (last) Tuesday and the numbers are continuing to grow.
These cases were reported through our rural leadership structures and
we have since communicated with the relevant ministry (of Health and
Child Welfare) but they are responding slowly," said Adv Dinha. "I am
not happy with the response from the Ministry of Health and Child
Welfare to this issue because the community reported that no
intervention has so far been done by health officials yet we alerted
them of the outbreak," he said.

Measles is considered an outbreak when a cluster of 5 or more
suspected cases or at least 3 confirmed positive cases in a district
or health facility within a month have been reported. Measles is a
highly contagious viral respiratory infection that causes high fever,
skin rash, running nose, watery eyes and a cough. The disease mainly
affects children under the age of 5 years. In unvaccinated children,
measles can cause severe diarrhoea leading to dehydration, blindness
to those with inadequate vitamin A, inflammation of the middle ear,
brain damage and death due to pneumonia.

The last wave of measles outbreaks claimed more than 400 children
mainly from apostolic sects, prompting Government and its partners to
launch a national immunisation campaign.

[Measles virus infection continues to kill many children in Zimbabwe.
Over a period of 2 weeks, 70 children have died. Most of the deaths,
according to the government, were in communities that decline
vaccination on religious grounds.
