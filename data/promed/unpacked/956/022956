FOOT & MOUTH DISEASE, CONTROL - BOTSWANA (02)

Mary Brown- I do not think that report is accurate- can you check? It
sounds like the die-off described in that report was the one due to
Contagious Bovine Pleuropneumonia (CBPP), not FMD. This is a very important
distinction, given that CBPP is a disease of cattle, not thought to be
transmitted by a wildlife vector. Hence, the disease epidemiology and
control measures are different. In addition, Botswana has a new ~190 km
double-fence going up south of Namibia's Caprivi strip, which has been
receiving much attention lately. Perhaps the author meant Namibia instead
of Zimbabwe? Please clarify with the source, in case incorrect information
is being disseminated.
