Pandemic (H1N1) 2009, Ukraine -- WHO Update 2
---------------------------------------------
As of 17 Nov 2009, preliminary tests reveal no significant changes in
the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus based on investigations of samples
taken from patients in Ukraine. Analyses are being performed by 2 WHO
influenza collaborating centres as part of the global influenza
surveillance network. Preliminary genetic sequencing shows that the
virus is similar to the virus used for production of the pandemic
influenza vaccine, reconfirming the vaccine's efficacy at this time.
Additional questions about the pandemic virus circulating in Ukraine
will be answered as more data is available.

The WHO commends the government of Ukraine for its open sharing of
samples to inform global monitoring of the virus for signs of change.
A total of 34 samples were analysed independently by the WHO
Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza, Mill
Hill in London, UK, and the WHO Collaborating Centre for the
Surveillance, Epidemiology and Control of Influenza in Atlanta, Georgia, USA.

[This statement from WHO has scotched some of the wilder rumours
regarding the identity of the agent responsible for the current
outbreak of influenza and acute respiratory illness in Ukraine. The
genome sequencing analyses carried out in the UK and the USA indicate
that the Ukrainian outbreak is an extension of the 2009 pandemic of
H1N1 influenza spreading eastwards through Europe and beyond. - Mod.CP]
