Spain adopts European BSE recommendations despite cattle farmers anger
-------------------------------------------------------------------
The Spanish Ministry of Health has angered the Spanish cattle industry by
banning on 15 May 1999 the sale of veal chops, intestines, and nervous
tissue
from cattle imported from European Union (EU) countries that have had cases
of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE).
On 28 June 1999, slaughterhouse workers from several Spanish regions went on
an
indefinite strike in protest at the ban, which will force them to separate
and destroy veal-calf spinal columns, making it almost impossible for them
to make veal chops. Removal of such tissues may represent an average loss of
US$350 per animal -- Spain imports 750 000 calves each year for this food
product.
FarmersÂ´ trade-unions have crititicised the ban, saying it was announced
without warning. A spokesperson for the National Association of Bovine Meat
Producers has said that the measure will probably paralyse a lot of
slaughterhouses and quartering facilities because of the time wasted
carrying out the spine separation procedure.
The director of the Basque government farming department, Asier Albizu,
criticised the ban saying that "to take such a measure suddenly and without
giving explanation has no sense". Albizu noted that 50km away in Hendaya,
France, slaughterhouses will continue the same practices and continue to
sell veal chops.
