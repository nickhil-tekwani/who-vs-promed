A suspected case of hantavirus infection was admitted to the regional hospital during the afternoon of Thursday [5 Nov 2015]. According to the information released, the case is a 44 year old man who works as a truck driver from San Antonia city in the Valparaiso region.

According to the preliminary information, the man came in to the Pozo Almonte clinic with a number of symptoms. After various examinations and checks, the medical staff decided to send the patient to the regional hospital as a suspected hantavirus [infection].

It is worth noting that the patient remains isolated until test results come in. Also, as a preventive measure, they decided to close the Pozo Almonte clinic immediately.

[Cases of human hantavirus infections occur fairly frequently in the endemic region of the central and southern coastal areas of Chile. Although not specified in this or previous reports from the region, the hantavirus involved in these cases is no doubt Andes virus. This virus is endemic in Chile, and cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome occur every year. The diagnostic system has been substantially improved. Rapid, accurate diagnosis is critical because of the speed with which the disease can progress and the urgency of proper treatment. Andes virus is rarely transmitted directly person-to-person and then only with very close physical contact, usually within the family.

Images of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_), the sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus, can be seen at http://www.hantavirus.cl/ecologia_enfermedad/galeria_reservorio.htm.
