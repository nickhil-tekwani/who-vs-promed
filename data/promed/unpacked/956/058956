Animal welfare workers fear one of County Durham's [England] largest colonies of swans could be wiped out after a spate of deliberate poisonings. The group of about 130 swans and cygnets on the River Wear at Chester-le-Street has been reduced to less than 80 since Christmas [December 2014].

Postmortem examinations have revealed all the dead birds were poisoned with lead -- probably in powder form. One theory is that bread laced with lead powder is being fed to the birds.

Linda Charlton, of the Swans Trust, said: "All the tests have shown the dead birds had lead poisoning, but the ducks and fish have not been affected. The Environment Agency have also done their own tests on the water and they have come back clear. I've been working with swans for 20 years and I've never seen deaths like this on this scale before. Some ill swans are being treated by vets. We have to reluctantly accept that this is deliberate poisoning and the swans are being targeted."

A number of ill birds -- some of which have gone blind -- are still being treated by vets. Vet Laura Petts said: "We are giving the ill birds medicine to help them excrete the heavy toxins in their bodies, but we fear some will have to be put down."

RSPCA [Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals] inspector Jaqui Miller added: "We are working closely with the police to try and discover exactly what's happening. Patrols in the area have been increased in the hope whoever is doing this will stop or we catch those responsible."

[Lead powder either as pure lead, lead oxide, or litharge lead (litharge is one of the natural mineral forms of lead oxide) find multiple applications in many industries including oil and gas exploration, radiological medical protective clothing, industrial X-ray shielding, golf club manufacturing, and anti-friction products.

Powered lead, powdered babbitt, and lead oxide have been used in lubricating grease, to reduce or eliminate wear. Lead powder is also used as the basis for some corrosion resistant paints. Lead oxides are used in producing fine "crystal glass" and "flint glass" of a high index of refraction for achromatic lenses.

So the question may be how is the lead, as lead powder being 'administered' to the birds, but not to other wildlife? While this may sound harsh, realizing that the lead is used in industry, is it possible for lead contamination to occur in any feed being fed to the birds? Are they fed on the land, or is the feed thrown into the water? If into the water, then one has to wonder why the fish are not testing positive. Unless the birds are fed in an enclosure, then one would wonder why other wild birds are not affected. So it seems we are backing into a corner of malicious poisonings targeting these particular birds.
