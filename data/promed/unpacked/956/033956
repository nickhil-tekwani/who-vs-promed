Ottawa Public Heath warns of provincial mumps outbreak
------------------------------------------------------
Even though there is no outbreak in Ottawa, public health officials
are making an appeal to parents to vaccinate their children. So far 31
cases have been reported in Ontario, including 2 in Ottawa.

"There were 2 cases ... they have completely recovered and they have
passed the stage where they could pass the virus on to anyone else,"
says Brenda MacLean of Ottawa Communicable Disease Prevention.

Mumps used to be a common childhood disease, but has been under
control since the development of a vaccine. Mumps is a viral infection
transmitted through direct contact. Signs of the infection include:
Fever, swelling or tenderness in the throat glands, and pain while
chewing.

Ottawa typically sees 3 or 4 cases of mumps per year. Public Health
officials say the recent cases are not cause for alarm.

[ProMED-mail received the following comment subsequent to the post
entitled: "Mumps - USA: (IL) university students, archive number 20110928.2936," about a mumps outbreak in Illinois, USA, which is
equally applicable to the preceding Canadian post. - Mod.CP]

One can't help but wonder from the reassuring tone of the news release
whether the health department and/or the University health officials
didn't miss a "teachable moment" with this outbreak, considering there
is no mention therein about the potential (although perhaps uncommon)
complications of preventable mumps infections, including orchitis,
aseptic meningitis, pancreatitis, hearing loss, etc.
