Grape mildews developing fungicide resistance
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The fungi causing downy mildew and powdery mildew of grape are
developing resistance to strobilurin fungicides according to a recent
report in Plant Health Progress, one of the journals found in the
on-line Plant Management Network (PMN). The research, reported by A
Baudoin, et al, is entitled "QoI (quinone outside inhibitors)
resistance of _Plasmopara viticola_ and _Erysiphe necator_ in the
mid-Atlantic United States." [see summary below]

The researchers reported on 2005 and 2006 pathogen collections made
in Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and North Carolina vineyards. In
one year, 75 percent of downy mildew isolates sampled were resistant
to strobilurin fungicides and over 90 percent of powdery mildew
collections were also resistant. The resistant pathogen strains were
obtained from vineyards where strobilurin fungicides had been used an
average of 2 to 3.4 times per year over several years. Where these
fungicides were not used, these grape pathogens were still
strobilurin-sensitive.

These results document that resistance of downy and powdery mildews
to strobilurin fungicides is widespread in the mid-Atlantic states
and suggest that fungicide resistance could be occurring in Kentucky
as well. Downy mildew (_Plasmopara viticola_) and powdery mildew
(_Erysiphe necator_) commonly occur in Kentucky grapes. Several
fungicides are listed for management of these diseases, including
strobilurins (also known as QoI compounds).

Mildew management techniques, if [strobilurin] fungicide control
failure is occurring, may include the use of other fungicides to
alternate with or substitute for strobilurins, being aware that some
of the alternative fungicides could develop resistance problems of
their own. In addition to the fungicide application critical period
between pre-bloom to 3-4 weeks after bloom, these 2 diseases still
may require management through the rest of the growing season.

and _Erysiphe necator_ in the mid-Atlantic United States. Plant
Health Progress, doi:10.1094/PHP-2008-0211-02-RS]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Of 20 _Plasmopara viticola_ isolates from 4 locations in Virginia and
northwest North Carolina, 16 were resistant to QoI fungicides. The
resistance factor was over 100, and label rates of formulated
azoxystrobin and pyraclostrobin provided little or no control.
Additional sampling revealed at least 15 additional vineyards with
QoI-resistant _P. viticola_ in Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania.
Of 22 isolates of _Erysiphe necator_ collected in 2005 from 5
Virginia locations, 20 isolates from 4 locations showed resistance to
QoI fungicides. The G143A mutation for resistance was detected in
several isolates of both pathogens. This is the 1st detection of this
type of resistance in _P. viticola_ in North America, and the 2nd
North American report of QoI resistance in _E. necator_.

[On grapevine, downy mildew is caused by the fungus _Plasmopara
viticola_. It causes lesions on leaves, which later become necrotic,
and can also affect flowers and fruits. During years with warm,
extended wet periods during bloom, fruit clusters may be partially or
totally destroyed. Grapevine powdery mildew is caused by the fungus
_Erysiphe necator_. Heavily infected leaves have reduced
photosynthetic ability resulting in decreased plant vigour, as well
as increased chance of winter injury to the vines. Mildew spores are
spread to the leaves and berries mainly by splashing rain, wind, or
mechanical means. The fungi overwinter in infected leaves on the
ground. Mildew diseases on grapevine can be extremely serious and
will cause severe crop loss. They are present worldwide and are
usually controlled with fungicides.

Downy and powdery mildews are fungal groups with each group causing
similar symptoms on a range of host plants. Each group includes many
species in a number of genera. Generally, each fungal species is
confined to a number of host species it affects. Mildews cause
serious losses in many important crops including cereals, hops,
sunflower, and a number of vegetable crops. Since these pathogens are
adapting and evolving constantly in response to agricultural
practices and chemicals used for disease control, strains with
increased virulence and additional fungicide resistances must be
expected to emerge.

Strobilurins are strongly antifungal agents produced by fungi. They
were first discovered in 1977 in _Strobilurus tenacellus_, a
basidiomycete growing on pinecones. Synthetic derivatives with
increased stability are now available. At present, strobilurins are
used worldwide as protectants against most major fungal plant
pathogens. Being derived from natural products, strobilurins are
considered to be environmentally safe and are rapidly degraded in the field.
