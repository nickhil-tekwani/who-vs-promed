[The above outbreak is China's 3rd reported peste des petits ruminants (PPR) outbreak since 5 Dec 2013; all 3 in the north-eastern regions of China, bordering Kazakhstan and Mongolia. For their respective locations, see map appended to the summarising report at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000014593_20140102_130916.pdf. The distance (in km/miles) between the recent Chinese outbreaks is measured in 3-digit figures; this may be indicative of a wider, and probably earlier circulation of the virus in China. An earlier PPR outbreak was reported in June 2010 from Tibet.

In several countries invaded by PPR during recent decades, the diagnosis was achieved only after some spread, PPR becoming endemic. Stamping out without vaccination has not been found effective for eradication.

PPR is known to be endemic in numerous African and Asian countries; for their list in OIE's WAHID system, see http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/statuslist (to view the list of countries by sanitary situation, choose the disease).

Following the officially accomplished global eradication of rinderpest, a bovine epizootic disease, the FAO and OIE have decided to target PPR, rinderpest's equivalent in small ruminants. Global eradication of PPR is an ambitious undertaking, considering the husbandry of small ruminants and, in particular, nomadism and their shorter pregnancy and higher twinning rates. In May 2013, PPR was added to the list of diseases for which the OIE has put in place a specific procedure for official recognition of disease status. The OIE Scientific Commission for Animal Diseases is responsible for undertaking the assessment of OIE Member Countries' applications for their compliance with OIE standards. The assessment carried out by the Scientific Commission is based on the recommendations formulated by a relevant experts ad hoc group. Further details are at http://www.oie.int/animal-health-in-the-world/official-disease-status/peste-des-petits-ruminants/.

In October 2012, OIE published the launching of a new project, "Vaccine Standards and Pilot Approach to PPR Control in Africa," to establish a PPR vaccine bank and develop a pilot strategy to control and progressively eradicate the disease in 2-3 African countries (http://www.oie.int/en/for-the-media/press-releases/detail/article/oie-launches-pilot-project-to-design-efficient-control-methods-for-peste-des-petits-ruminants-a-dev/).

FAO's global framework document, intended to serve as a guideline to formulate subregional or regional strategies for the progressive control and eradication of PPR, is available at http://www.fao.org/docrep/017/aq236e/aq236e.pdf. - Mod.AS
