The Ministry of Health (MOH) has advised that the use of 2 influenza vaccines in Singapore be "temporarily ceased" as a precautionary measure after deaths were reported in South Korea following vaccinations.

South Korean health authorities said they have found no direct link between the deaths and the flu shots.

"This is a precautionary measure following reported deaths after influenza vaccination in South Korea," the MOH said in a press release on Sunday [25 Oct 2020]. "No deaths associated with influenza vaccination have been reported in Singapore to date."

Dozens of South Koreans died this month [October 2020] after receiving flu shots as part of a state-run vaccination programme. As of Saturday [24 Oct 2020], 48 deaths had been reported.

On Sunday [25 Oct 2020], the MOH said that the ministry and the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) were monitoring the situation closely.

"HSA is in touch with the South Korean authorities for further information as they investigate to determine if the deaths are related to influenza vaccinations. Based on information released by the South Korean health authorities, 7 brands of influenza vaccines were administered to the individuals involved in the deaths reported in South Korea," the ministry said.

Two of the 7 brands are available in Singapore, MOH added. They are SKYCellflu Quadrivalent, manufactured by SK Bioscience and locally distributed by AJ Biologics; and VaxigripTetra, manufactured by Sanofi Pasteur and locally distributed by Sanofi Aventis.

"As a precautionary measure while HSA is assessing the implications of the reported deaths in South Korea, the MOH has informed healthcare providers and medical practitioners to temporarily stop the use of these 2 vaccines," the ministry said.

It added: "Healthcare providers and medical practitioners may continue to use the 2 other influenza vaccines that have been brought into Singapore for the Northern Hemisphere 2020/21 influenza season."

The MOH said that people recommended to receive the influenza vaccination may continue to receive their vaccination using other brands of vaccines. This included people recommended to receive the vaccination under the National Childhood Immunisation Schedule and National Adult Immunisation Schedule.

The ministry added that the vaccination provided protection against seasonal influenza viruses and was effective in reducing the risk of complications and deaths due to influenza. "This is especially so for vulnerable groups such as the elderly, the young, pregnant women and those with certain pre-existing medical conditions," it said.

"Influenza vaccination is generally safe and well tolerated." The ministry said common side effects from influenza vaccination may include soreness and redness at the injection site, fever, headaches, muscle aches, fatigue and nausea. "These side effects are generally mild and resolve on their own. In rare instances, a person may experience high fever or severe allergic reactions (such as breathing difficulty, wheezing and swelling around the eyes) and immediate medical attention should be sought," the MOH said.

It added that vaccines approved for use in Singapore have been evaluated by HSA to ensure that they meet "required international standards of quality, safety and efficacy. To ensure that the benefits continue to outweigh the risks, HSA monitors the safety of vaccines through an adverse event monitoring system. It draws on the network of local healthcare professionals and international regulatory counterparts to pick up adverse events suspected to be associated with the vaccines," MOH said.

The ministry said it would continue to assess the situation as more information became available and further advise on the use of the affected vaccines.

[Singapore also announced a halt to the 2 vaccines associated with the deaths in South Korea. No deaths associated with influenza vaccination have been reported in Singapore to date, but the decision to halt the use of SKYCellflu Quadrivalent and VaxigripTetra was precautionary, the health ministry and the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) said in a statement on Sunday (25 Oct 2020; https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/10/26/singapore-halts-use-flu-vaccines-48-die-south-korea/).

ProMED thanks Monir Taha, MD, Associate Medical Officer of Health, Ottawa Public Health, for her comments regarding the report ProMED-mail Influenza (10): South Korea 20201025.7888308 concerning the question whether "a parallel steep increase in deaths was seen in the general population who were not vaccinated." Dr. Taha wrote: "If a significant proportion of the Korean population is getting vaccinated, including elderly persons and those with chronic conditions, then if every death in someone who was vaccinated is reported, likely most deaths represent expected mortality. The question that is not addressed by the news story is if there have been more observed deaths than expected in a specified time period, if the adjusted mortality rate in vaccinated is different from those not vaccinated, or if the risk of death is higher in some specified time period after vaccination than before."

These are important points Dr. Taha raises. My concern with the mortality as reported was that it was not clear whether the observed deaths were within the range of background mortality, data on which would serve as a baseline to evaluate the safety profile of the immunization. Other studies have demonstrated no increase in mortality within a few days following vaccination, with some increase by 30 and 60 days, particularly in older people who one would expect would be dying of multiple causes, less so in younger people. But the report out of South Korea is not clear on the time between vaccination and death. It also does not break down the deaths by age-group. Thus, it is not clear whether an unusual event is taking place. Forty-eight reported deaths following vaccination does seem high, especially with a jump from 12 on one day to 48 the next. But again, a baseline mortality would assist in evaluation. The government's conclusion to continue with the mass vaccination campaign with alternative vaccines is a good approach, during which an investigation is warranted to try to elucidate whether there is a problem. It is interesting that Taiwan also has experienced a few deaths -- see next post -- but similarly ruled out the flu vaccine. - Mod.LK]

[2] Taiwan: Flu vaccine
Date: Wed 28 Oct 2020 10:54 CST

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4039237


Taiwan's health authorities on Tuesday [27 Oct 2020] ruled out influenza vaccination as the cause of death for 4 seniors who died after receiving a flu jab.

Seeking to allay public fears about the safety of the shots, Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) head Chen Shih-chung stated at a press conference that the 4 cases had died of chronic conditions, including cardiovascular disease, and that their deaths are not believed to be related to the vaccine.

On the status of a 51-year-old man in Taichung, who was admitted into intensive care for the rare Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) less than 2 weeks after getting a flu vaccine, CECC advisory specialist panel convener Chang Shan-chwen said no correlation between the man's illness and the vaccine had been established yet. More tests would be needed to clarify the issue, CNA cited him as saying.

Around 4.3 million of the government-funded shots had been administered as of Monday [26 Oct 2020], with 76 cases reported of recipients experiencing adverse reactions, including 25 serious ones. This rate is considered normal and does not necessitate a halt to the program, Chen pointed out.

The CECC urged people to seek treatment should they exhibit concerning symptoms after being vaccinated, such as sustained fever for over 48 hours, difficulty breathing, or rapid heartbeat.

The Taiwan Centers for Disease Control has cautioned 5 types of people against getting an influenza vaccine:
- Those with a fever or acute or serious health condition
- Infants younger than 6 months old
- Those who developed GBS within 6 weeks after a previous inoculation
- Those allergic to eggs
- Those advised after a medical assessment not to receive the vaccine

[It is a little concerning that both Taiwan and South Korea have identified deaths following flu vaccination, yet both state the deaths are not related to the vaccine itself. Also, in this report out of Taiwan, Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) was observed following vaccination of one patient, yet again considered to not be related to the vaccination.

GBS is a rare disorder in which a person's own immune system damages their nerve cells, causing muscle weakness and sometimes paralysis. GBS can cause symptoms that usually last for a few weeks. Most people recover fully from GBS, but some people have long-term nerve damage. In very rare cases, people have died of GBS, usually from difficulty breathing. In the USA, an estimated 3000-6000 people develop GBS each year.

The background rate for GBS in the USA is about 80-160 cases of GBS each week, regardless of vaccination. The data on the association between GBS and seasonal flu vaccination are variable and inconsistent across flu seasons. If there is an increased risk of GBS following flu vaccination, it is small, on the order of 1-2 additional GBS cases per million doses of flu vaccine administered (https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevent/guillainbarre.htm). - Mod.LK
