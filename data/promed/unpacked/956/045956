The origin of the BTV-6 in the Netherlands has for a while been
associated with the vaccine strain from Onderstepoort Biological
Products (OBP). At OBP, we feel that this is inconclusive, and we
wish to affirm our availability to assist in any way reasonably
possible. We believe that more needs to be done to determine and
confirm the origin of this outbreak through comparative sequencing
studies and phylogenic comparisons of the whole genome of the vaccine
strain to isolates of wild type BTV's from Africa and Asia. Only then
can an acceptable confirmation in terms of origin of the BTV-6 be
made. We do know that the BTV phylogeny of South African and, for
that matter, African viruses have on VP2 alone a close serotype
relatedness with each other and the vaccine strain.

According to information derived from the Central Veterinary
Institute in Lelystad (Wageningen University and Research Centre),
only one to 2 animals per holding have been found infected by BTV-6.
A surveillance, carried out around the 1st affected farms in Eastern
Netherlands, has been practically completed. So far, 11 farms have
been found affected; all the affected animals are cows with the
exception of one single sheep. The fact that only one to 2 animals
have been found infected (by PCR) in each of the 11 farms is
puzzling, but serological tests may follow to help in clarifying the situation.

In addition to the infections in the Netherlands, 4 cattle holdings
have been found infected last week in Germany (Bentheim, Lower
Saxony). No other BTV-6 cases have been discovered elsewhere in Europe.

[Posting 20081031.3431 included the report of an investigation of the
Dutch BTV-6 strain, carried out commonly by the following 3 institutes:
1. Institute for Animal Health, Pirbright Laboratory, Surrey (OIE
Reference BTV laboratory);
2. Onderstepoort Veterinary Institute, Onderstepoort, South Africa
(OIE Reference BTV laboratory);
3. The Central Veterinary Institute of Wageningen UR (CVI), Lelystad,
The Netherlands.

The following appears in the last part of the concluding remarks:

"It has been suggested that the virus could have arrived in the
region as the result of illegal use of live attenuated BTV vaccines,
and Bottle-A of the South African BTV vaccine does contain BTV-1, a
strain of current concern in many regions of Europe. However, the
absence of antibodies to multiple other serotypes in the antiserum
from Heeten indicates that this animal at least had not received
either of the multivalent vaccine preparations that are known to have
been generated by OBP in South Africa.

We are currently sequencing the entire genome of the new virus strain
to see if it is completely similar to the live vaccine strain or if
it is a reassortant containing genome segments from other strains.
This might provide additional indications concerning its origins and
movement (as with the BTV-16 strain from Italy 2002 - Batten et al 2008)".

To reach final conclusions about the origin of this enigmatic
outbreak, the expected results of the serological tests in Lelystad
and of the sequencing of the entire genome of the new virus strain in
Pirbright should be taken into consideration. - Mod.AS]
