There are 20 intoxicated with adulterated liquor. The cases of poisonings have increased in these weeks, compared to the same period of 2021.

The latest data related to the consumption of adulterated liquor in Colombia are disturbing: according to the National Institute of Health (INS), as of 9 Dec [2022], 20 cases of poisoning by methanol have already been detected. The alcohol is used as a paint thinner and to manufacture antifreeze, pesticides, and certain types of fuel.

These cases are due to an outbreak that began in late November [2022]. The 1st symptoms began to present in patients from Bogotá on 22 Nov [2022]. Unfortunately, 3 men and one woman passed away on 5-6 Dec [2022]. Their ages ranged from 37 to 74 years. All the people tested positive, precisely, for methanol. They consumed, specifically, 4 drinks, according to the INS: Rey de Reyes, Cabañitas, Old Jhon, and Capo.

In fact, Invima admitted they have identified products not meeting the sanitary conditions or the necessary requirements to be marketed. In some cases, an article does not have sanitary registration; in others, the drinks use, fraudulently, the sanitary registration of products that do have it.

This Fri 9 Dec [2022], another health alert was published warning about 3 fraudulent products: El Parrandero, Ardiente El Gran Niche Xtreme, and Anís Cartujo.

[While illegal alcohol or some mixture thereof occurs from time to time, it seems to be primarily because methanol is used instead of ethanol.

"Methanol toxicity initially lacks severe toxic manifestations. Its pathophysiology represents a classic example of lethal synthesis in which toxic metabolites cause fatality after a characteristic latent period."

In other words, these people may not realize they are sick or ill until sometime after consumption.

"Methanol is sometimes used as an ethanol substitute for alcohol."
(https://nap.nationalacademies.org/download/4795)

"Foods such as fresh fruits and vegetables, fruit juices, fermented beverages, and diet soft drinks containing aspartame are the primary sources of methanol in the human body," but they contain minute quantities.
(https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/ershdb/emergencyresponsecard_29750029.html)

Also known as wood alcohol, methanol is a commonly used toxic organic solvent that, when ingested, can cause metabolic acidosis, neurologic issues, and death. It is a part of many commercial industrial solvents and of adulterated alcoholic beverages or is mistaken as being the same as alcohol for ingestion. "Methanol toxicity remains a common problem in many parts of the developing world, especially among members of lower socioeconomic classes."
(https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1174890-overview)

Neurological complications are recognized more frequently due to advanced technologies and because of early recognition of the toxicity and advances in supportive care. "Hemodialysis and better management of acid-base disturbances remain the most important therapeutic improvements."
(https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1174890-overview)

"Serum methanol levels of greater than 20 mg/dL correlate with ocular injury. Fundoscopic changes are notable within only a few hours after methanol ingestion."

"The mechanism by which the methanol causes toxicity to the visual system is not well understood. Formic acid, the toxic metabolite of methanol, is regarded as being responsible for ocular toxicity," and blindness can occur in humans.

"The prognosis in methanol poisoning correlates with the amount of methanol consumed and the subsequent degree of metabolic acidosis; more severe acidosis confers a poorer prognosis."

"Methanol has a relatively low toxicity. The adverse effects are thought to be from the accumulation of formic acid, a metabolite of methanol metabolism."

"The prognosis is further dependent on the amount of formic acid that has accumulated in the blood, with a direct correlation existing between the formic acid concentration and morbidity and mortality. Little long-term improvement can be expected in patients with neurologic complications.

"The minimal lethal dose of methanol in adults is believed to be 1 mg/kg of body weight. The exact rates of morbidity and mortality from methanol intoxication are not available.
(https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1174890-overview#showall)

Rapid early treatment is necessary for survival, but sequelae such as blindness may be permanent.

"Metabolic acidosis in methanol poisoning may necessitate the administration of bicarbonate and assisted ventilation. Bicarbonate potentially may reverse visual deficits. In addition, bicarbonate may help to decrease the amount of active formic acid.

"Antidote therapy, often using ethanol or fomepizole, is directed toward delaying methanol metabolism until the methanol is eliminated from the patient's system either naturally or via dialysis. Like methanol, ethanol is metabolized by ADH, but the enzyme's affinity for ethanol is 10 to 20 times higher than it is for methanol. Fomepizole is also metabolized by ADH; however, its use is limited because of high cost and lack of availability.

"Hemodialysis can easily remove methanol and formic acid. Indications for this procedure include (1) greater than 30 mL of methanol ingested, (2) serum methanol level greater than 20 mg/dL, (3) observation of visual complications, and (4) no improvement in acidosis despite repeated sodium bicarbonate infusions."
(https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1174890-treatment)

Intravenous administration of ethanol in a 10% dextrose solution may be helpful. As ethanol prolongs the elimination half-life of methanol, the treatment may take several days, and the patient should be hospitalized. Dialysis may be necessary to prevent kidney failure as well. Hemodialysis remains an effective treatment. - Mod.TG
