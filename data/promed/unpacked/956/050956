Days after a St. Johns County warning of possible mosquito-borne
illnesses to animals and humans, Clay County health officials
reported that 2 horses have tested positive for eastern equine encephalitis.

Encephalitis, along with West Nile virus and dengue fever, are spread
by mosquitoes, which are prevalent across the area due to hot weather
and standing water left by summer rain storms, which are where the
insects are hatched.

Clay County Mosquito Control and the Clay County Health Department
continue surveillance and prevention efforts. Residents and visitors
are encouraged to take basic precautions to help limit exposure to mosquitoes.

Jacksonville Mosquito Control officials told Channel 4 earlier in the
week that the peak season for mosquitoes is just arriving.

"We're trying to stay ahead of the game and to prevent an outbreak or
the spread of disease," Clark said.

Mosquito Control workers said chickens are used as sentinels to alert
agencies of what's going around from bug bites. Smith and other
health officials said the most important thing to avoid the illnesses
is preventing the bite.

They recommend the following guidelines to stay safe:

- Try to avoid being outdoors at dusk and dawn when the bugs are most active.
- Dress appropriately, covering your arms and legs.
- Use DEET or other repellents.
- Be proactive and drain all standing water around your home, which
is where mosquitoes breed.

"Every year can be a bad year," Smith said. "[With] afternoon
thunderstorms, warm temperatures, mosquitoes are going to be
increasing very quickly."

[While protecting ourselves from mosquitoes and the diseases they can
transmit, we also need to protect our pets, especially our horses.
Horses can be protected against this deadly disease by a vaccination
conferring protection from eastern equine and western equine
encephalitis and West Nile virus. It takes at least 2 weeks for
horses to develop immunity. If you have not vaccinated your animal,
please so do at once and avoid a tragedy.

Eastern equine encephalitis cannot be passed from horses to humans or
humans to horses. The mosquito is responsible for spreading the
disease. Controlling mosquitoes and their breeding places, which can
be tiny bits of standing water, are critical to stopping the
mosquitoes. - Mod.TG]
