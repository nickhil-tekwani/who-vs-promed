The viruses from 5 cases of porcine epidemic diarrhoea (PED) recently investigated by Iowa State University have a different gene sequence from those investigated since April 2013, showing greater similarity to strains isolated in China between 2004 and 2012.

Iowa State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory (ISU VDL) is offering PED virus (PEDV) S1 (1st 2.2kb portion of the spike gene) sequencing to the clientele to help determine the genetic relatedness and molecular epidemiology of PEDV in US swine. During the time periods of 24 to 29 Jan 2014, PEDV S1 sequencing was performed on 15 PEDV cases at ISU VDL. Among them, PEDV S1 sequences from 10 cases (ISU cases 6 to 15) are similar to each other and to the PEDV strains identified in US swine since April 2013 (99.1 to 100 per cent nucleotide identities).

In distinct contrast, the PEDV S1 sequences from the other 5 cases (ISU cases 1 to 5) only have 93.9 to 94.6 per cent nucleotide identities to the PEDV strains previously identified in US swine. However, these 5 PEDV cases shared 99.6 to 100 per cent nucleotide identities with each other based on the S1 sequences.

Phylogenetic analysis based on the S1 sequences demonstrated that aforementioned 10 PEDV cases clustered together with PEDV strains identified in US since April 2013. However, the aforementioned 5 PEDV cases clustered very differently from the PEDV strains previously identified in US swine. Sequence alignment showed that the S1 sequences of these five PEDV cases had some deletions and insertions compared to PEDVs previously identified in US.

Based on the data currently available, it appears unlikely that this strain is a mutant evolved from PEDV previously identified in US swine. Determination of the entire genome sequences of these new PEDVs is in progress and will help determine the origin of the viruses.

The PEDV real-time RT-PCR offered at ISU VDL is targeting the nucleocapsid (N) gene. The N-gene is known to be a conserved portion of the PEDV genome. Thus far, the PEDV N-gene real-time RT-PCR being conducted at the ISU VDL seems to be readily detecting these new PEDVs. The full-length N gene sequences of the new PEDVs have been determined and were similar to the PEDVs previously identified in the US.

The porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV) retained infectivity in drinking water for more than one week, according to new research.

Samples of PEDV negative ground water and recycled water were autoclaved, spiked with PEDV, and then stored at room temperature (around 25 deg C [77 deg F]), reports the University of Minnesota College of Veterinary Medicine. Samples were taken weekly from the stored water to infect 10 day old pigs in bioassay.

Bioassay results showed virus infectivity in the one-week sample and inactivity in the 2-week sample both drinking and recycled water.

[This fast moving disease seems to be one step ahead by adapting to increasing pressures. We can only hope at this point that it is not necessarily a more resistant strain to our attempts to rid ourselves of this virus.

The research thus for on the length of time the virus remains active in the water may be longer than thought and this may be a key to finding a way to kill it. - Mod.TG]
