Black Fungus or Mucormycosis, a rare fungal infection in Covid patients, has claimed 9 lives in Pimpri-Chinchwad's Yashwantrao Chavan Memorial Hospital (YCMH), with 2 patients losing vision in one of their eyes.

The city has been recording a rise in Black Fungus infections over the past 2 months.

YCMH Dean Dr. Rajendra Wable said the hospital alone has seen 9 deaths so far and around 40 to 50 patients are undergoing treatment. "Of the total patients undergoing treatment, half were discharged after they recovered from COVID. The rest of them have come to YCMH from other hospitals for treatment," he added.

"Mucormycosis is the primary cause of the deaths and COVID the secondary cause. Mucormycosis occurs due to the virus. It can happen while the patient is undergoing treatment or after the patient has recovered from COVID," he added.

Dr. Wable said once a COVID patient has recovered and discharged from the hospital, he or she should strictly adhere to the medical regimen prescribed by his/her doctors.

"The medicines, especially for thinning blood, should be regularly taken. Some patients suddenly stop the medicines, which could prove detrimental to them as it leads to the formation of the Black Fungus in nose or jaws," he said.

Dr. Aniket Lathi, who heads the ENT section at YCMH, said, "Mucormycosis cannot be treated as an isolated cause of death. It happens because of COVID and post- COVID complications. The Black Fungus usually starts from the jaws, spreads to the eyes and brain. It proves fatal if left untreated."

Dr. Lathi said Mucormycosis affects those COVID patients, who had been on antibiotics, steroids and remdesivir and were admitted in the ICU. "Such cases are common post-COVID and among those with comorbidities, especially those with high blood sugar," he said.

Dr. Roopali Maheshgauri, an ophthalmologist at YCMH, said: "2 patients have lost vision in one of their eyes, impacted by Mucormycosis. Both of them are female, aged above 60, and diabetic." She said they had to perform eye surgeries on the patients to save their lives. "One eye of each patient had to be removed to save their lives. There was no other alternative. The patients are stable now but will take some time to recover fully," she added.

Dr. Yeshwant Ingle, who heads the dental department at YCMH, said: "After recovering from COVID, patients should take their prescribed medicines regularly and use antiseptic-diluted solution for gargle etc. Care should be taken to ensure that the solution is properly diluted."

Dr. Ingle said in the 1st wave, they had hardly seen such cases. "In the 2nd wave, we see Mucormycosis cases regularly with symptoms like headache, constant light fever, clogging of the nasal tract, bloody or blackish mucus emission from the nose, pain on only one side of the face, the severity of redness of jaw, prominent aching in teeth and hazy vision," Dr. Ingle added.

Dr. Shrikrishna Joshi of Lokmanya Hospital said, "Excess use of steroids and uncontrolled diabetes are the 2 major reasons behind the growth of Black Fungus. If steroids are used judiciously, glucose levels won't rise in a patient and therefore, there will be fewer chances of fungal growth. However, if steroids are used excessively, the possibility of fungal growth cannot be ruled out. Steroids are mainly used to reduce inflammation among COVID patients."

Comorbidities, racial disparity found in homeless hospital COVID patients
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Almost 2 thirds of homeless patients hospitalized for COVID-19 were of non-White descent and more than 80% had at least one comorbidity, according to a descriptive study in The Journal of Infectious Diseases yesterday [Sun 16 May 2021].

The researchers analyzed 199 COVID-hospitalized adults who were experiencing homelessness out of the 2872 (30.2%) patients in the COVID-NET database with homelessness status from [1 Mar - 31 May 2020]. The cohort was 82.9% men, had a median age of 53 years, and were mostly non-White (63.3%).

When analyzing the patient data, the researchers used weighted percentages (WPs) to reflect what the population estimates would be if every medical record they pulled had homelessness information. For instance, in the cohort, almost 1 in 5 patients had a mental illness (38, 19.1%), but weighting changed the proportion to 1 in 12 (8.4%).

Most patients had at least one underlying health condition (155; WP, 83.0%), with the most common being high blood pressure (77; WP, 43.9%), cardiovascular disease (36; WP, 24.9%), obesity (59; WP, 23.6%), and chronic lung disease (43; WP, 22.3%). Most were also current smokers (105; WP, 45.9%), and 70 (WP, 33.7%) abused alcohol.

The median length of hospital stay was 4 days, and 37 were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU; WP, 16.9%). A total of 18 people needed invasive mechanical ventilation (WP, 11.3%), while 27 (WP, 15.0%) needed any type of respiratory support. As many as 6 patients died (WP, 1.1%).

Compared with a COVID-NET study of the general adult population in Clinical Infectious Diseases in July 2020 [Kim L, Garg S, O'Halloran A, et al. Risk Factors for Intensive Care Unit Admission and In-hospital Mortality Among Hospitalized Adults Identified through the US Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)-Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network (COVID-NET), Clinical Infectious Diseases 72 ( 9). 1 May 2021, Pages e206-e214, https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa1012], this study similarly shows a high prevalence of comorbidities. The current study group, however, had a younger median age (53 vs 62 years) and a higher proportion of minorities and current smokers.

Additionally, the 2020 study revealed that mechanical ventilation procedures did not vary by race and ethnicity and that White patients had a higher prevalence of in-hospital death. This study's results indicated that Hispanic and Black people accounted for most instances of mechanical ventilation or in-hospital death.

https://doi.org/10.1093/infdis/jiab261

Abstract
People experiencing homelessness (PEH) are at higher risk for chronic health conditions, but clinical characteristics and outcomes for PEH hospitalized with COVID-19 are not known. We analyzed population-based surveillance data of COVID-19-associated hospitalizations during [1 Mar to 31 May 2020]. A total of 2% of the people hospitalized with COVID-19 for whom a housing status was recorded were homeless. Of 199 cases in the analytic sample, most were of racial/ethnic minority groups, and had underlying health conditions. Clinical outcomes such as ICU admission, respiratory support including mechanical ventilation, and deaths were documented. Hispanic and Non-Hispanic Black persons accounted for most mechanical ventilation and deaths. Severe illness was common among persons experiencing homelessness who were hospitalized with COVID-19.

Discussion
...These findings fill a critical gap in understanding morbidity and mortality among people hospitalized with COVID-19 experiencing homelessness and highlight the importance of targeting effective prevention strategies including COVID-19 vaccination efforts among marginalized groups. (14,15).]

[See URL for references. This study seeks to address the gap in available data on the impact of COVID-19 on the homeless population.

"Many outbreaks occurred in homeless shelters and unsheltered people have been infected as well. One study showed the mortality rate of homeless people in New York was 75% higher than the city's rate https://www.coalitionforthehomeless.org/age-adjusted-mortality-rate-for-sheltered-homeless-new-yorkers/. It's just that an accounting of these deaths, like homeless people themselves, seems to have slipped through the cracks." (excerpted from https://www.statnews.com/2021/03/11/the-uncounted-people-who-are-homeless-are-invisible-victims-of-covid-19/).

The increased mortality is likely a consequence of the greater level of comorbidities of the homeless as well as poor nutrition. The fact that Hispanic and Non-Hispanic Black persons accounted for most mechanical ventilation [thus severe illness] and deaths is a consequence of the inequities in the economic and health care systems that COVID has highlighted. - Mod.LK]

[3] South Carolina: reinfection

COVID-19 reinfection found in 2% of university students
-------------------------------------------------------
In the spring 2021 semester, 2.2% of Clemson University, South Carolina, students previously infected with COVID-19 were diagnosed as having been reinfected, according to a study published yesterday in Clinical Infectious Diseases.

The researchers looked at 16 101 students 17 to 24 years old from [19 Aug to 5 Oct 2020], as those after may have lingering viral RNA during weekly spring semester testing. Going into the spring semester, 12.6% of the cohort were considered to have a previous COVID-19 infection.

The university conducted mandatory weekly saliva tests during the spring 2021 semester, with a compliance rate of 83%. Overall, 44 students were reinfected (2.2% of the previously infected cohort), compared with 12.1% of students who had their 1st COVID-19 infection during the spring 2021 semester. The researchers estimate that protection from reinfection was 84% (95% confidence interval, 78% to 88%).

The reinfected students had a median age of 20.3 years. Most were female (51.4%) and didn't live in the dorms (66.2%) The median time to reinfection was 129 days, and the researchers say the Kaplan-Meier probability estimate of no reinfection for at least 8 months is 97.2%.

"Since 16% of this population remains susceptible to reinfection, precautions should still be employed by previously infected individuals (e.g., face coverings)," the researchers write. (The article was received by the journal 17 Apr 2021, before the CDC's revised mask guidelines 13 May 2021). "As natural protection is not guaranteed, these findings strongly support vaccination of those previously infected with SARS-CoV-2. However, individuals without previous SARS-CoV-2 infections could be given prioritization when vaccines are in short supply."

https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciab454

"Conclusion. In a university student population subjected to mandatory repeated testing, we estimate that previous SARS-CoV-2 infection protects 84% of young people from reinfection in the 3 to 8-month study time period. While this age group is largely asymptomatic and therefore less likely to experience severe outcomes, (14) it is estimated that asymptomatic individuals account for over half of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. (15) Since 16% of this population remains susceptible to reinfection, precautions should still be employed by previously infected individuals (e.g., face coverings). As natural protection is not guaranteed, these findings strongly support vaccination of those previously infected with SARS-CoV2. However, individuals without previous SARS-CoV-2 infections could be given prioritization when vaccines are in short supply."

This study suggests either vaccination of previously infected students or wearing of masks in spite of having been infected is recommended as precaution against re-infection and possible further spread of the virus. - Mod LK]

[4] Convalescent plasma

Plasma from recovered patients found not helpful for COVID hospital patients
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Convalescent plasma given to hospitalized COVID-19 patients did not improve survival or rates of release from the hospital within 28 days, need for invasive mechanical ventilation, or death, according to the most recent findings of the Randomised Evaluation of COVID-19 Therapy (RECOVERY) trial in the United Kingdom.

The results, published late last week [w/e 16 May 2021] in The Lancet, add to evidence that SARS-CoV-2 antibody-rich plasma taken from COVID-19 survivors doesn't benefit severely ill coronavirus patients. The RECOVERY trial is evaluating several possible treatments for hospitalized COVID-19 patients at 177 National Health Services sites.

Death, mechanical ventilation, hospital release
-----------------------------------------------
The researchers assigned 11 558 patients to receive either convalescent plasma or usual care in a 1:1 ratio from [28 May 2020] to [15 Jan 2021].

There were no significant differences in 28-day death rates (24% in both groups; rate ratio [RR], 1.00) or in any patient subgroup, including those with no detectable SARS-CoV-2 antibodies at treatment assignment and those treated with convalescent plasma within 4 days after symptom onset.

Neither did convalescent plasma significantly affect the share of patients released from the hospital within 28 days (66% in both groups; RR, 0.99) or requiring mechanical ventilation after treatment assignment (29% in both groups; RR, 0.99). Median time to hospital release was 12 days in those who received convalescent plasma and 11 days in the usual-care group.

Similarly, no differences were observed in the use of ventilation, successful weaning from invasive mechanical ventilation, need for dialysis, or cause-specific death rate.

Severe allergic reactions occurred in less than 1% of both groups, and there were no differences in the occurrence of sudden worsening of respiratory status, fever, sudden low blood pressure, hemolysis (red blood cell rupture or destruction), abnormal blood clotting, or major heart rhythm abnormalities.

A total of 9 patients in the convalescent plasma group had pulmonary reactions, including 3 possible transfusion-related deaths, and 4 patients developed fever, allergic reactions, or low blood pressure.

Patients were, on average, 63.5 years old, and the median time from symptom onset to study treatment assignment was 9 days. At randomization, 5% of patients were receiving invasive mechanical ventilation, while 87% were on supplementary oxygen (with or without noninvasive respiratory support), 8% required no supplementary oxygen, and 92% were receiving corticosteroids. Of the 83% of all patients with baseline serology results, 38% had no evidence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies at treatment assignment.

Weighing costs, defining benefits
---------------------------------
The authors noted the appeal of using convalescent plasma in seriously ill COVID-19 patients because it became available weeks after the emergence of the pandemic and its broad use for this purpose outside of clinical trials. "Until now, there has been insufficient evidence from randomised trials to reliably assess its safety and efficacy," the authors concluded.

"In RECOVERY, the largest clinical trial of convalescent plasma for any infectious indication, we did not find evidence that high-titre convalescent plasma improved survival or other prespecified clinical outcomes in patients hospitalised with COVID-19. Whether convalescent plasma would benefit other patient groups is unknown and would need to be evaluated in other, adequately powered, randomised clinical trials."

In a commentary in the same journal, Sean Liu, MD, PhD, and Judith Aberg, MD, both of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City, said that hospitalized COVID-19 patients with impaired antibody-mediated immunity may still benefit from convalescent plasma. But given plasma donors', blood banks', and medical teams' considerable investments in each convalescent plasma infusion, each one should be considered carefully as to whether it will provide any benefit.

"Future ambulatory trials with convalescent plasma might need to be matched against monoclonal antibody therapies or hyperimmune immunoglobulin, and eligibility criteria will need to tightly define the population most likely to benefit," Liu and Aberg wrote.

"Current and future studies are exploring the next class of COVID-19 therapeutics, including small-molecule antivirals, next-generation monoclonal and polyclonal antibody therapies, and immunomodulatory agents."

https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(21)01064-3

"Several retrospective observational studies in 2020 suggested a beneficial role of convalescent plasma for patients hospitalised with severe COVID-19. Following these initial reports, a series of peer-reviewed randomised trials did not confirm the positive findings. The absence of efficacy of convalescent plasma is now reinforced by the results from the RECOVERY Collaborative Group, published in The Lancet [above].

"The RECOVERY Collaborative Group has contributed valuable conclusions against the use of convalescent plasma for patients hospitalised with COVID-19. Special populations, such as patients with impaired humoral immunity, who were not actively considered in this study, might still benefit from convalescent plasma when admitted. ... "
