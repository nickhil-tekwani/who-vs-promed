Technicians who are investigating the Legionnaire's outbreak at Lisbon's Sao
Francisco Xavier Hospital have found poor maintenance in the cooling towers and detected conditions that were conducive for bacteria to multiply, the general health director said on [Wed 29 Nov 2017].

Speaking to MPs at a parliamentary health commission, Gra√ßa Freitas said that deficient maintenance had been found.

The preliminary report drawn up by the health authorities who visited the hospital said that the cooling tower was in a poor state of repair.

Taking into account the degradation inside the cooling tower, the specialists suggested it should be replaced by another one without water. This comes after the Portuguese health minister, Adalberto Campos Fernandes, apologised to the Legionnaire's victims and said that they must be compensated for the damage done, during the parliamentary discussion about the state budget for health. The Minister said Sao Francisco Xavier Hospital in Lisbon, the companies responsible for surveillance and the Lisbon and Tagus Valley Regional Health Administration must also apologise to the victims.

The Legionnaire's outbreak at Sao Francisco Xavier Hospital infected 56
people, 5 of whom died as a result.

[The news report above now says that the total number of cases of nosocomial Legionnaires' disease at Sao Francisco Xavier Hospital in Lisbon is 56; 5 of the cases were fatal. This total, we were told previously, included 2 hospital employees. The above news report intimates that the hospital's cooling tower was at fault.

However, we have never been told what _Legionella_ species was isolated from the cases, whether the genotypes of the clinical isolates matched each other, which would establish a common source outbreak, or whether the species and genotype of the isolates from the suspected environmental source matched the species and genotypes of the clinical isolates, which would establish the transmission pathway.

The Hospital of Sao Francisco Xavier opened 24 Apr 1987 in the western part of Lisbon and serves a population of about 934 723 residents (https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=pt&u=https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital_de_S%25C3%25A3o_Francisco_Xavier&prev=search). - Mod.ML
