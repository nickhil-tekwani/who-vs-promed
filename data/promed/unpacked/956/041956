With the deadly anthrax outbreak reported in tribal districts of the State, the Fisheries and Animal Resources Development Department has come up with a new project which not only looks to cover the endemic pockets with vaccination but also incentivize the disease reporting. Anthrax has been reported in 19 districts including Angul, Balasore, Bargarh, Cuttack, Deogarh, Dhenkanal, Jajpur, Jharsuguda, Koraput, Kandhamal, Kalahandi, Keonjhar, Khurda, Malkangiri, Mayurbhanj, Nuapada, Puri, Rayagada and Sundargarh which have been designated endemic. Elephants, at least 12 of them, have died due to anthrax in last 2 years.

Under the project, the Department plans to conduct vaccination in the 19 endemic districts where it plans to cover 19 lakh [1.9 million] animals. It has also made a provision of remuneration to farmers for reporting the disease and for disposing the carcass of a dead animal.

Commissioner-cum-Secretary Bishnupada Sethi said, the person who reports anthrax incidence in the endemic pockets first will be eligible for a Rs 1000 [15 USD] incentive provided the disease is confirmed as anthrax by the veterinarian. Similarly, animal owners will be provided an incentive of Rs 1000 [15 USD] per dead animal for proper disposal which has to be done through deep burial with lime treatment to prevent further transmission.

Besides, massive awareness on safe handling and non-consumption of meat affected with anthrax through mass media, preliminary as well as confirmatory diagnosis, surveillance and research on anthrax epidemiology will be carried out. Sethi said, the project will control and contain anthrax not only in animals but also in human population in the endemic districts.

[This is an admirable programme and should be very successful. The Canadians introduced a very similar programme in the mid-1960's and saw the rancher reporting of suspect case take off from a baseline of virtually no reports of anthrax. And it provided the backbone for their successful control of this disease. But latterly they learnt something else. As the incidence fell away lately to just a few outbreaks per year they found that their ranchers were not vaccinating their stock and retroactively responding as & when an outbreak was reported. And this brought about a couple of province-wide epidemics. So I suggest that in about 3 years when the Odisha programme has settled in, the extent of the reward should reflect whether the herd had been vaccinated prior to the dead animal(s) being reported. You still want them to report but it is very important that the livestock are vaccinated each year until the serious problematic areas have been identified. Then you can limit vaccination to just those areas while you see the disease out. But from today to then it is going to be some 10-15 years. But it will succeed.

In the meanwhile a fascinating study has been published on how the toxic factors interact in the production of the lethal and oedema toxins; see:
