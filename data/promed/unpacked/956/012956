Rift Valley Fever kills 60 people in Sudan -- WHO
-------------------------------------------------
An outbreak of Rift Valley fever in Sudan has struck at least 125 people,
killing 60 of them, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Friday [2
Oct 2007]. The United Nations health agency said 2 weeks ago that it was
investigating a deadly outbreak in Sudan suspected to be yellow fever [see:
ProMED-mail post "Yellow fever - Sudan: susp., RFI 20071020.3419"], but
laboratory tests have shown it was Rift Valley fever, WHO spokesman John
Rainford said.

"There are 125 human cases and 60 deaths," he told Reuters. More
investigation was needed into the outbreak, which had erupted in White
Nile, Sennar, and Jazeera provinces in central and eastern Sudan, including
the exact timing of the first cases, Rainford said. "Right now we don't
have a clear picture." [A map of Sudan and its constituent provinces can be

Rift Valley fever virus, transmitted by contact with the blood or organs of
infected animals, can also be carried by mosquitoes, according to the WHO.
Herders, farmers, veterinarians and slaughterhouse workers are deemed at
higher risk of infection from the disease, which can devastate livestock.

While most human cases are relatively mild, a small percentage of patients
develop a much more severe haemorrhagic form which can cause them to vomit
blood or pass it in their faeces. Bleeding from the nose or gums can also
occur.

The nearly 50 per cent fatality rate was "very high" compared to the usual
expectations for Rift Valley fever, but it was likely that many more mild
cases have not been detected in Sudan, according to Rainford. "The Sudanese
government has been highly cooperative and transparent in sharing
information," Rainford said. WHO officials were in the area of the outbreak
and the United States Naval Medical Research Unit NAMRU-3 laboratory in
Cairo had helped with the laboratory analysis, he added.

[Rift Valley fever virus is a member of the genus _Phlebovirus_ (family
_Bunyaviridae_). The virus was 1st identified in 1931 during an
investigation into an epidemic among sheep on a farm in the Rift Valley of
Kenya. Since then, outbreaks have been reported in sub-Saharan and North
Africa. In 1997-98, a major outbreak occurred in Kenya, Somalia, and
Tanzania and again in September 2000, and more recently mainly affecting
livestock in 2006/2007, Rift Valley fever cases have been confirmed also in
Saudi Arabia and Yemen (see references below), being the first reported
occurrence of the disease outside the African continent. A map of the
distribution of endemic and sporadic Rift valley fever can be accessed at
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/spb/mnpages/dispages/rvf/rvfmap.htm>.

The vast majority of human infections result from direct or indirect
contact with the blood or organs of infected animals. The virus can be
transmitted to humans through the handling of animal tissue during
slaughtering or butchering, assisting with animal births, conducting
veterinary procedures, or from the disposal of carcasses or fetuses.
Certain occupational groups such as herders, farmers, slaughterhouse
workers and veterinarians are therefore at higher risk of infection. The
virus infects humans through inoculation, for example via a wound from an
infected knife or through contact with broken skin, or through inhalation
of aerosols produced during the slaughter of infected animals. The aerosol
mode of transmission has also led to infection in laboratory workers. There
is some evidence that humans may also become infected with Rift Valley
fever by ingesting the unpasteurized or uncooked milk of infected animals.

Human infections have also resulted from the bites of infected mosquitoes,
most commonly the _Aedes_ mosquito. Transmission of Rift Valley fever virus
by hematophagous (blood-feeding) flies is also possible. To date, no
human-to-human transmission of Rift Valley fever has been documented.

Illness in humans is usually mild. However, in some patients the illness
can progress to hemorrhagic fever (which can lead to shock or hemorrhage),
encephalitis (inflammation of the brain, which can lead to headaches, coma,
or seizures), or ocular disease (diseases affecting the eye).
