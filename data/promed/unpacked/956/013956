MADISON, Wisconsin. Oscar Mayer Foods announced that it is voluntarily
recalling one day's production of two OSCAR MAYER sliced luncheon meat
products that may contain _Listeria_ bacteria. The two recalled products
are 9 oz. OSCAR MAYER Club Sandwich Variety-Pak sliced luncheon meats and
10 oz. OSCAR MAYER All American Variety-Pak sliced luncheon meats both with
the JAN 12 date in the upper left corner on the back of the package. The
two products were distributed nationally and should no longer be in stores,
since they are now past their shelf life date.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has tested samples of the JAN 12
OSCAR MAYER Club Sandwich Variety-Pak and found _Listeria_. The OSCAR MAYER
All American Variety-Pak was made on the same day on the same line, so the
company is recalling both products with the JAN 12 date. There has been a
single report of illness potentially linked to the OSCAR MAYER Club
Sandwich Variety-Pak product.
OSCAR MAYER Club Sandwich Variety-Pak contains smoked turkey breast, smoked
cooked ham and oven roasted turkey breast slices. OSCAR MAYER All American
Variety-Pak contains cotto salami, bologna and chopped ham slices. Both
variety packs have a JAN 12 date in the upper left corner on the back of
the package.
No other dates of Variety-Pak are part of the recall. No other OSCAR MAYER
sliced luncheon meats, hotdogs or bacon are part of the recall.
The company is cooperating fully with USDA.
"Safety is our first and highest concern. We are doing everything possible
to ensure the well-being of our consumers and the integrity of our
products," said Richard G. Searer, President of Oscar Mayer Foods.
Consumers who have purchased the two products with the JAN 12 date should
not eat them and should return the packages to the store where purchased
for a full refund. Consumers with questions about the products involved in
the recall can call 1-800-433-9362 from 7:00 A.M. CST to 10:00 P.M. CST.
Information about the recall can also be found at the company's website at
www.oscar-mayer.com/specialreport, beginning at 5:00 PM CST on January 15.
****
This recall is at least the fourth in the United States related to
_Listeria_ since October. Oscar Mayer was cited as saying there has been
one report of potential illness linked to the Oscar Mayer Club Sandwich
Variety-Pak product.
The U.S. Agriculture Department was cited as saying that so far it did not
believe that this case of _Listeria_ [contamination was linked to an
outbreak being investigated by the department and the Atlanta-based Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention, adding, "At this point FSIS (the USDA's
Food Safety and Inspection Service) has no evidence linking this product to
the nationwide listeriosis outbreak, which is still under joint FSIS and
CDC investigation," the USDA said in a statement on the Oscar Mayer recall.
