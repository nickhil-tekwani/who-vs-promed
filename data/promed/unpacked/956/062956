Japan calls a halt to encephalitis vaccinations
-----------------------------------------------
Japan's Health, Labor and Welfare Ministry asked municipal governments
across the country on Monday [30 May 2005] to stop recommending
vaccinations for minors against Japanese encephalitis, after a case of
suspected serious side effects.
The ministry issued the rare instruction because a female junior high
school student in east Japan's Yamanashi Prefecture fell into critical
condition after receiving an inoculation against the disease last year [2004].
According to the ministry, the student was diagnosed as suffering acute
disseminated encephalomyelitis, known as ADEM, a disease causing a nerve
disorder, and doctors suspected it was a side effect of the vaccination.
The student's symptoms were so serious that she needed respiratory aid.
The ministry's decision is also based on the fact that the number of
Japanese encephalitis patients has been reduced to 10 or less a year, and
in some years, the number of those reported suffering ADEM and other side
effects have outnumbered patients. More than 4 million young Japanese
annually receive the vaccinations under municipal recommendations.
Children have been recommended to receive it 3 times between 6 months and
7-and-a-half years of age. They are then to get another between the ages of
9 and 12, and the last one at the age of 14 or 15.
ADEM causes brain and spinal cord damage, which brings about headaches,
sensory disruption, impaired consciousness and paralysis.
The ministry has recognized cases of more than 10 people suffering ADEM
linked to the vaccination since 1994.
As mouse brains are used in producing Japanese encephalitis vaccines, some
medical experts say tiny amounts of mouse brain tissue remaining in the
vaccines may have a causal link with the side effects.
Japanese encephalitis is a disease transmitted via mosquitoes that suck pig
blood containing the virus. It cannot be transmitted between humans. One to
0.1 percent of people who contract the virus develop the disease, and the
rate of death among the patients is about 15 percent. Some 45 to 70 percent
of survivors are said to suffer complications. Tens of thousands of people
suffer the disease every year around the world.

[Weighing the risks and benefits of a vaccine program has to be done prior
to considering its launch or re-launch with modifications. The current
program of Japanese encephalitis (JE) vaccinations has been carried out
routinely in Japan since 1994 and has involved 4 million young Japanese
annually. I wonder whether the sudden decision to halt the program is as
well thought out as it appears to be. Who knows, it may be just a temporary
decision allowing health authorities to do a series of retrospective
studies, such as a re-estimate of the risks and benefits ratio or checking
on the quality of the vaccines used, before arriving at a better solution.
Surveillance of JE vaccine-related complications in Japan during the years
1965-1973 disclosed neurological events (principally, encephalitis,
encephalopathy, seizures, and peripheral neuropathy) among one to 2.3 per
million persons vaccinated. ProMED appreciates further information from
either the Japanese health authorities or colleagues familiar with the
field and the situation.
