Tangerang regency in Banten province has recorded 5 deaths from bird
flu after the latest victim, a 12-year-old boy, died from the virus
on 13 Oct 2007. The regency health agency's head of communicable
disease prevention, Yuliah Iskandar, told The Jakarta Post on Tuesday
[16 Oct 2007] that the boy, a resident of Ceger village in Sepatan
district, had suffered high fever from 30 Sep 2007 but was only
admitted to Tangerang General Hospital on 8 Oct 2007. The boy was
then transferred to Persahabatan Hospital on 9 Oct 2007 under
suspicions he had contracted bird flu.

The boy had shown symptoms of fever, leukopenia (a decrease in the
number of white blood cells), thrombocytopenia (a decrease in the
number of platelets in the blood) and pneumonia (an infection of the
lung that causes respiration problems). The Health Ministry's
research and development center confirmed a day later the boy had
been infected by the H5N1 virus. "He was brought here last Tuesday
[16 Oct 2007] and placed directly in the special care unit for bird
flu patients. He died on Saturday [20 Oct 2007]," said an on-duty
nurse at the hospital.

Yuliah said the agency had taken blood samples from the victim's
family members and his neighbors to be tested at a Health Ministry
laboratory, with the results to be announced within 3 days. Yuliah
said the victim and his family had not had direct contact with live
poultry and birds near the house in the village, but there was a
poultry-breeding business some 500 meters away from the victim's
house. "We have assigned a team to investigate the source of the H5N1
virus in the neighborhood, but there are no indications bird flu has
spread in the neighborhood," she said.

Following the deaths of an official at the Supreme Audit Agency (BPK)
and his 2 young daughters from bird flu early in July 2005, the
central government declared Tangerang a bird flu red zone. In August
[2007], a Tangerang maid died from bird flu 2 days after being
treated for a high fever and acute pneumonia at Tangerang's Sari Asih
Hospital. Her employers, residents of Perumnas II complex in
Tangerang regency, said they had no idea how their maid contracted
the virus, because there were no chickens at their home or in the
neighborhood.

Banten province has recorded 19 human cases of bird flu, 15 of which
have been fatal. Banten Governor Ratu Atut Chosiah issued a bylaw on
poultry restrictions on 19 Jan 2007, which included a ban on keeping
backyard fowl. Unfortunately, the ordinance has yet to take effect
due to prolonged protests from the Banten Council.

[No human cases of H5N1 avian influenza virus infection have been
reported anywhere in the world except Indonesia since 25 Jul 2007.
The continued sporadic occurrence of human cases in Indonesia may be
a consequence of the inability of local authorities to enforce a ban
on the keeping of backyard fowl rather than any exceptional virulence
of the virus circulating in Indonesia. However, in the case of the
latest victim described above, a direct link with diseased fowl has
not yet been established.
