American visceral leishmaniasis, popularly known as kala-azar, was
classically a rural zoonosis, but the destruction of natural habitat has
led to a reduction in wild hosts and a change in the feeding habits of the
sandfly vector, which now seeks domestic animals -- mainly dogs -- and
humans, leading to infection in the suburbs of towns and cities.
Urban transmission was first detected in the Northeast Region of Brazil,
and later elsewhere with the exception of the South. In the state of Mato
Grosso do Sul, the first case of human infection was confirmed in 1937, in
Coxim township, to the north of Campo Grande [the present state capital]
and northeast of Tres Lagoas.
Tres Lagoas
-----------
In this township the first 2 cases were confirmed in 2000. In 2001 there
were 30 cases, including 4 deaths. This year [2002] 44 cases have been
notified to date. Most of these cases have been children, suggesting that
adult urban immigrants may have some previous immunity.
Campo Grande
------------
The first 2 autochthonous cases in the capital were confirmed recently.
Control
-------
Control measures have been implemented since the year 2000, with a
serosurvey of dogs -- the positives were euthanized -- and residual
insecticides sprayed in houses. There have also been health education
campaigns. Since December 2001 diagnostic kits and drugs for treatment have
been distributed, and in January 2002 a course in diagnosis and treatment
was held for health workers of the Basic Health Network.
On 22 May 2002 the Manager of the Visceral Lieshmaniasis Control Program
will visit Tres Lagoas to evaluate the situation. On 7 Jun 2002 there will
be a seminar for health workers in Campo Grande on surveillance, treatment
and control.

Correction
----------
The following section of the previous post on this subject (see ref. below)
"The centre has confirmed leishmaniasis in 16.5 per cent of cases
investigated in the first 3 months of 2002, which indicates epidemic activity."
should have read
"The centre has confirmed leishmaniasis in 16.5 per cent of dogs
investigated in the first 3 months of 2002, which indicates epidemic
activity. Last year [2001], only 2.1 percent of dogs tested were positive."
