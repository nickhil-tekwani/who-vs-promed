Mystery disease claims 7 lives
------------------------------
An outbreak of a mystery disease has claimed the lives of 7 people in
Sindhupalchowk district in the last 5 days [21-25 Jul 2008]. Local
residents said that patients suffering from the mystery disease died
within 24 to 72 hours of contracting the disease.

The outbreak has direly affected 3 VDCs [Village Development
Committees] in the district because of which locals are starting to
flee to save their lives.

Dr. Nandalal Sikarmi of the district hospital said that patients
suffering from the disease complain of vomiting and headache. He said
that they haven't been able to identify the disease yet. Villagers are
terrified after finding persons who had gone to bed in a normal
condition dead the next day.

[The above newswire does not provide sufficient information to narrow
down a possible differential diagnosis listing for the described
deaths. A symptom complex that includes headache and vomiting is too
vague to narrow down possibilities. Headache could simply be a symptom
related to a high fever, or could be related to a central nervous
system infection as seen with encephalitis or meningitis. In addition,
there is no information on the age distribution nor gender of the
cases which. for example. might suggest an occupational exposure if
the cases were male adults. In the absence of more information, this
moderator is hesitant to speculate further on the possible etiology of
these reported deaths.

ProMED-mail would greatly appreciate more information on this as yet
unsubstantiated report of an outbreak of fatal illnesses in Nepal.
