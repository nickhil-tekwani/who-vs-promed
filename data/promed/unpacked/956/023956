South Georgia peanut crops [are being] destroyed by diseases called white mold and leaf spot. "Both are caused by fungi," said Bob Kemerait, University of Georgia. "It's an interaction of the wet year, the amount of disease that was already present from previous years, the ability to get fungicide in properly, and the selection of fungicide," he explained. "Yields are probably cut by 30 or 40 per cent. There is no recovery once it gets this bad."

Specialists said growers spend millions of dollars trying to fight these diseases. The only hope of restoring the crop, they said, would be to aggressively manage it for 2 to 3 years by removing debris, finding a good crop rotation and fungicide, or just finding something else to plant, like cotton or corn.

[White mould on peanut is caused by _Athelia rolfsii_ (previously _Sclerotium rolfsii_). This fungus can also cause seedling blight on the crop and is a major pathogen of peanut with yield losses of up to 60 per cent. White mould symptoms on peanut may include wilting of upper shoots ("shepherd's crook") as well as white fungal growth and brown sclerotia on stem and crowns of the plant.

The fungus is soilborne and has a wide host range in warm, humid regions, including many crops. Many wild and weedy species may serve as pathogen reservoirs. The pathogen survives between seasons as sclerotia (hard, protective structures) which then provide primary inoculum for new crops. It does not produce spores but is spread with soil, farm machinery and plant debris. Disease management may include deep plowing, phytosanitation, crop rotation of several years and some fungicide treatments. Similar diseases on other crops, which are also called white mould, may be caused by _Sclerotinium_ species.

Peanut leaf spot diseases can be caused by _Cercospora arachidicola_ ('early') or _Nothopassalora personata_ ('late'; previously _Phaeoisariopsis personata_). Leaf spots reduce photosynthetic ability and vigour of plants and therefore lead to reduction in yield and quality of crops. Leaf spot fungi are spread via infected plant material and some may also be seed borne. Disease management generally relies on fungicides, but resistant pathogen strains may be emerging. Rotating or mixing chemical classes of fungicides is used to extend the useful life of the compounds. Resistance breeding to develop new crop cultivars is an alternative.

Leaf spot diseases on a range of crops (such as sugar beet, soybean, coffee, maize) can be caused by other fungi previously classified as _Cercospora_ species. While some of them have since been attributed to different genera, the diseases are often still referred to as cercospora leaf or eye spots.
