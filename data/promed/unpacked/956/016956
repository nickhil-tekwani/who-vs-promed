The visceral leishmaniasis, or kala-azar, outbreak in Kenya has been continuous since 2020. A total of 2037 visceral leishmaniasis (suspected and confirmed) cases have been reported in Marsabit, Garissa, Kitui, Baringo, West Pokot, Mandera, Wajir, and Isiolo counties, with a total of 10 deaths reported.

The outbreak is active in 4 counties, West Pokot County in Pokot North, Pokot South, and West Pokot sub-counties; Kitui County from Mwingi North and Mwingi Central sub-counties; Wajir County from Wajir East, West, South, and Eldas sub-counties; and Isiolo County.

In the past week, 22 new cases were reported from West Pokot County.

Leishmaniasis is a parasitic disease spread by the bite of an infected sandfly. The most common types of leishmaniasis are cutaneous and visceral. The cutaneous type causes skin sores, and the visceral type affects internal organs such as the spleen, liver, and bone marrow.

[The Kenyan Ministry of Health (MoH) has prepared "The Strategic Plan for Control of Leishmaniasis 2021-2025"; see at https://www.health.go.ke/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/KSPC-OF-LEISHMANIASIS-STRATEGY-2021-2025.pdf. Figure 1.2 of this report shows a map of visceral leishmaniasis cases reported in Kenya at Ward level in each of the endemic counties 2017-2020, naming many of the counties listed in the news report above.

From the Introduction of the MoH report:
"In Kenya, leishmaniasis remains a public health problem mainly distributed in more than 20 sub-counties in the arid and semi-arid regions. These are generally marginalized areas with high levels of poverty and vulnerability, with poor health and development infrastructure."

"Kenya has no strategy to guide the control and elimination of leishmaniasis with the disease expanding to new foci. This strategic plan will therefore guide MoH and all partners working on leishmaniasis in controlling the disease and work towards its elimination as a public health problem. The main goal of this strategic plan is to reduce morbidity due to leishmaniasis in Kenya by 60% by 2025 and also reduce the occurrence of leishmaniasis outbreaks in Kenya by 50%. The strategy will guide the control and management of leishmaniasis with a focus on disease ecology and mapping, case identification and management, health systems strengthening, surveillance and vector control." - Mod.LXL
