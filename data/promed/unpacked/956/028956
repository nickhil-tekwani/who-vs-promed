The New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene issued an alert Wednesday [13 May 2015] over an uptick in Legionnaires' disease cases in Queens [one of the 5 boroughs of New York City]. According to health officials, the increase in Legionnaires' disease was noted in the Flushing-Clearview section of Queens.

From April to May 2015, 10 cases were diagnosed among Queens residents compared with 4 in May 2014 and 4 in April-May 2013. In the past 5 years, a median of 50 Legionnaires' disease cases was reported in Queens each year. Within Queens, 9 of the 10 recent case-patients resided in the Flushing-Clearview neighborhoods; in 2014, 7 of 50 total Queens cases were from these neighborhoods.

The Health Department is investigating to determine whether or not cases are due to a common exposure. In addition, health officials are reminding practitioners to test for _Legionella_ when evaluating Queens residents who may have community-acquired pneumonia.

This follows the December 2014-January 2015 outbreak at Co-Op City [Co-op City, located in the Baychester section of the Bronx in northeast New York City, with 15 372 residential units, is the largest housing cooperatives in the world] in the Bronx [another one of the 5 boroughs of New York City, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Co-op_City,_Bronx].

Legionnaires' disease gained national notoriety in 1976 when the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) discovered it during an epidemic of pneumonia among American legion members at a convention in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].

The causative organism is the bacterium _Legionella pneumophila_. Other species have also been implicated in Legionnaires' disease. The _Legionella_ bacteria are found throughout nature; because of this, most people become exposed to it, but few develop symptoms. The primary place in nature it's found is water sources, particularly at warmer temperatures; lakes, rivers and moist soil. It is also found in man-made facilities (frequently the source of outbreaks) such as air-conditioning ducts and cooling towers, humidifiers, whirlpools and hospital equipment. People get exposed through inhaling infectious aerosols from these water sources. There is no transmission from person to person.

The infection can appear in 2 clinical forms: Legionnaires' disease and Pontiac fever. Both conditions are typified by headache, fever, body aches and occasionally abdominal pain and diarrhea. Legionnaires' disease is the cause of pneumonia where a non-productive cough is typical. Fatality rates of this form of the infection are around 15 percent even with improvements in treatment. Pontiac fever is a self-limiting flu-like illness that does not progress to pneumonia or death. Diagnosis is usually made by typical symptoms in an outbreak setting. Diagnosis of Legionnaires' disease depends on identifying the bacteria in microbiological culture, detecting the antigen in urine samples or a 4-fold increase in antibody titer.

Certain health conditions that make you more susceptible to infection include increasing age, smoking, chronic lung disease, malignancy and diabetes mellitus. Legionnaires' disease is treatable with antibiotics.

[The] following things can be done as preventive measures: cooling towers should be drained when not in use and cleaned to remove scale, and sediment and biocides can be used to limit bacterial growth. Tap water should not be used in respiratory therapy devices.

[Flushing is a neighborhood in the north-central part of the borough of Queens in New York City. While much of the neighborhood is residential, downtown Flushing, centered on the northern end of Main Street, is a large commercial and retail area and is the 4th largest business district in New York City (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flushing,_Queens). The Clearview neighborhood is bounded on the west by the Murray Hill subsection of Flushing and bounded on the east by the Clearview Expressway (I-295), a connector between the Throgs Neck Bridge and mid-Queens (http://www.streetadvisor.com/clearview-queens-new-york-city-new-york). The Flushing-Clearview area is approximately bounded on the north and west by highway I-678, east by I-295 and south by I-495 (Long Island Expressway). For a map of this area, see https://www.google.com/maps/place/Flushing,+Queens,+NY/.

For discussions of Legionnaires' disease, please see the moderator's comments in prior ProMED-mail posts.

Genotyping of patient and environmental _Legionella_ isolates may aid in establishing transmission pathways. The predominance of one genotype of _Legionella_ isolated from patient specimens would suggest transmission from a common source. Because _Legionella_ may be found in environmental samples without linkage to any cases of legionellosis, the actual causative infectious reservoir can be confirmed by matching the genotype of clinical and environmental isolates (see http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC86783/ and http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2730281/). However, this is often difficult in legionellosis outbreaks, because the diagnosis of Legionnaires' disease is frequently made only on the basis of urinary _Legionella pneumophila_ serogroup 1 antigen testing or serology rather than isolation of the organism from cultures of respiratory tract specimens. Consequently, clinical isolates are often not available for genotyping.

ProMED-mail would appreciate more information from knowledgeable sources if there are any epidemiologic links among the cases and if genotyping has been done on clinical and possible environmental sources and if there are any common genotype patterns. - Mod.ML
