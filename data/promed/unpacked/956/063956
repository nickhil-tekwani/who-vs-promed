[Some] wheat crops in Pathankot [district] have been affected by 'yellow rust' disease. Earlier, the disease was detected in a few parts of [Rupnagar district]. The Punjab Agriculture department has alerted the farmers to take immediate precautions [and] to use spray as per the recommendations by the Punjab Agriculture University (PAU).

Officials and farmers of [the] entire sub-mountainous region of the state which includes parts of Rupnagar, Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar, Gurdaspur and Hoshiarpur districts, are kept on high alert and have been asked to conduct regular surveys of the crop.

[Stripe rust (also called yellow rust) of cereals is caused by the fungus _Puccinia striiformis_. The disease affects wheat (_Triticum aestivum_), durum wheat (_T. turgidum_), some barley varieties, triticale (wheat/rye hybrids) and a number of wild grasses. It causes yellow stripes on leaves which leads to loss of photosynthetic ability and plant vigour, as well as stunting of plants. Yield losses of 40 to 100 per cent have been reported in wheat.

Spores are wind dispersed in several cycles during the cropping season. Grasses and volunteer crop plants may generate a "green bridge", providing inoculum for the next crop cycle. Disease monitoring is important so that timely action can be taken to limit the spread of the pathogen as well as build-up of inoculum. Disease management may include the use of resistant varieties, fungicide applications and control of pathogen reservoirs. Monitoring and resistance breeding programmes have been established in different regions for early detection of new rust strains and to attempt to stay ahead of pathogen evolution.

While stem rust (_Puccinia graminis_) poses a huge potential threat to world wheat production, stripe rust is currently causing the most damage to wheat crops on a global scale. New strains of both rusts with increased virulence and additional fungicide resistances have been reported in recent years from wheat-growing areas worldwide. Climate warming allowing survival of wheat rusts on green bridges into higher latitudes is another example of pathogens extending their range due to climate change (see also ProMED-mail posts 20141024.2895414, 20120809.1235745, 20090914.3230, 20110718.2172). Projects for double resistance breeding to manage both stripe and stem rusts simultaneously are in progress (see ProMED-mail post 20120831.1274190).

In India, of the cereal rusts, stripe rust is the most serious constraint to wheat production. Leaf rust (_Puccinia recondita_) can be problematic, stem rust occurs regionally but is considered to be under control. Rust monitoring and pathotyping is coordinated by the national Directorate of Wheat Research; resistance breeding is carried out at ICAR (Indian Institute of Wheat and Barley Research; see link below).
