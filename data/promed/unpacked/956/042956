Declining trends in influenza activity in WHO European Region
-------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
-------
- This issue is based on data reported in week 10/2011 [7-13 Mar
2011] by 47 [of the 53] Member States in the WHO European Region.
- Influenza-like illness (ILI) and acute respiratory infection (ARI)
activity has passed recent peaks in 37 countries of the Region.
- Sentinel hospitalizations for severe acute respiratory infection
(SARI) are generally declining, but remain above pre-season levels in
some countries.
- 42 percent of sentinel specimens from patients with ILI and/or ARI,
and 46 percent of specimens from sentinel SARI patients tested
positive for influenza.
- Pandemic influenza A(H1N1) 2009 and influenza B continue to
co-circulate in the Region.

Current situation -- week 10/2011 [7-13 Mar 2011]
-------------------------------------------------
During week 10/2011 [7-13 Mar 2011], 23 countries reported a low
intensity of influenza and 20 countries reported medium intensity.
Among 43 countries reporting on the geographical spread of influenza,
a majority reported either sporadic (14) or local (13) activity, while
16 reported either regional or widespread activity. The impact of
influenza on health care systems was low in 20 and moderate in 5 of
the 25 countries reporting on this indicator. Clinical data also
suggest decreasing influenza activity in much of the WHO European
Region. Of the 44 countries reporting on consultation rates for ILI
and/or ARI, 18 countries reported decreases and 37 have passed
apparent peaks in ILI or ARI clinical activity.

Data from sentinel hospital-based surveillance for SARI were received
from 10 countries (Armenia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Malta,
the Republic of Moldova, Romania, the Russian Federation, Serbia, and
Ukraine). During week 10/2011 [7-13 Mar 2011], sentinel SARI
hospitalizations decreased substantially in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan,
and the Russian Federation. In Georgia, the Republic of Moldova,
Romania, Serbia, and Ukraine, SARI hospitalizations have decreased
compared to recent weeks, but they remain above pre-season levels. In
the 4 countries (Georgia, the Republic of Moldova, Romania, and the
Russian Federation) testing 10 or more sentinel SARI specimens, the
percentage testing positive for influenza ranged from 30 percent in
the Russian Federation to 63 percent in Romania.

Virological situation -- week 10/2011 [7-13 Mar 2011]
-----------------------------------------------------
Pandemic influenza A(H1N1) 2009 was reported to be dominant in 7
countries and co-dominant with influenza B in 12 countries. Influenza
B was dominant in 6 countries.

Sentinel physicians collected 1107 respiratory specimens, of which
459 (42 percent) were positive for influenza virus: 212 (46 percent)
were influenza A and 247 (54 percent) were influenza B. Of the
influenza A viruses, 194 were subtyped: 180 (93 percent) as pandemic
A(H1) and 14 (7 percent) as A(H3). In the 18 countries testing 20 or
more sentinel specimens, influenza positivity ranged from 0 percent to
88 percent, with a median of 31 percent (mean: 38 percent). In
addition, 2318 non-sentinel specimens were reported positive for
influenza: 1518 (65 percent) influenza A and 800 (35 percent)
influenza B. Of the influenza A viruses, 1248 were subtyped: 1216 (97
percent) as pandemic A(H1) and 32 (3 percent) as A(H3).

Out of 145 sentinel SARI specimens collected during week 10/2011
[7-13 Mar 2011] (data from 9 countries), 67 (46 percent) tested
positive for influenza: 39 (58 percent) were influenza A; 28 (42
percent) were influenza B. Of the influenza A viruses, 31 were
subtyped: 25 (81 percent) as pandemic A(H1), and 6 (19 percent) as
A(H3).

Cumulative virological update -- weeks 40/2010-10/2011 [4 Oct 2010-13
mar 2011]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
A total of 77 832 influenza virus detections were reported during
this period, of which 55 808 (72 percent) were influenza A and 22 024
(28 percent) were influenza B. Of the influenza A viruses, 43 910 were
subtyped: 42 419 (97 percent) as pandemic A(H1), 1490 (3 percent) as
influenza A(H3), and 1 as influenza A(H1).

From week 40/2010 [4-10 Oct 2010] to week 10/2011 [7-13 Mar 2011],
1312 out of 4583 sentinel SARI specimens (29 percent) tested positive
for influenza. Of these influenza viruses, 707 (54 percent) were
influenza A and 605 (46 percent) influenza B. Of the influenza A
viruses, 478 were subtyped: 437 (91 percent) as pandemic A(H1) and 41
(9 percent) as influenza A(H3).

Since week 40/2010, 3384 influenza viruses have been characterized
antigenically: 1668 were A(H1) pandemic A/California/7/2009
(H1N1)-like; 1482 were B/Brisbane/60/2008-like (B/Victoria/2/87
lineage); 112 were A(H3) A/Perth/16/2009 (H3N2)-like; 121 were
B/Florida/4/2006-like (B/Yamagata/16/88 lineage); and 1 was
B/Bangladesh/3333/2007-like (B/Yamagata/16/88 lineage). Based on the
genetic characterization of 485 influenza viruses, 207 belonged to the
pandemic A/California/7/2009 A(H1N1) clade; 10 belonged to the
pandemic A/Christchurch/16/2010 A(H1) clade; 46 belonged to the
pandemic A/Hong Kong/2213/2010 A(H1) clade; 41 were reported as A(H1)
pandemic not attributed to group category but belonging to the
recently emerged A/England/142/2010 subgroup characterized by S185T
substitution in the HA; 11 belonged to the A(H3) clade represented by
A/Perth/16/2009; 7 belonged to the A(H3) clade represented by
A/Victoria/208/2009; 29 belonged to the subgroup represented by A/Hong
Kong/2121/2010 in the A/Victoria/208/2009 A(H3) clade; 16 belonged to
the B/Bangladesh/3333/2007 clade (Yamagata lineage); and 118 to the
B/Brisbane/60/2008 clade (Victoria lineage).

Since week 40/2010, 8 countries (Germany, Ireland, Italy,
Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Switzerland, and the UK) have screened
1227 viruses for susceptibility to the neuraminidase inhibitors
oseltamivir and zanamivir. The UK analysed most of the viruses
screened (728). Out of the 1144 pandemic A(H1N1) viruses that were
tested, 1112 were sensitive to both inhibitors, and 32 viruses (2.8
percent) carried the NA H275Y mutation. These 32 viruses were
resistant to oseltamivir but remained sensitive to zanamivir. 3
influenza A(H3N2) viruses were tested and found to be sensitive to
both inhibitors. All of the 80 influenza B viruses tested for
susceptibility to oseltamivir and zanamivir were found to be
sensitive. All 174 pandemic influenza A(H1N1) 2009 viruses and 2
A(H3N2) viruses that were screened for susceptibility to adamantanes
were found to be resistant.

Comment
-------
ILI and ARI consultation rates continue to decline throughout most
parts of the WHO European Region with all countries reporting medium
or low activity during week 10/2011 [7-13 Mar 2011]. The percentage of
sentinel ILI, ARI and SARI specimens testing positive for influenza
has also declined in recent weeks in many countries, but influenza
activity continues. While pandemic influenza A(H1N1) 2009 and
influenza B currently co-dominate in northern, western and central
Europe, pandemic influenza A(H1N1) 2009 is the dominant virus in
eastern part of the Region.

[In brief: clinical data suggest decreasing influenza activity in
much of the WHO European Region. The percentage of sentinel ILI, ARI,
and SARI specimens testing positive for influenza has also declined in
recent weeks in many countries. Pandemic influenza A(H1N1) 2009 was
reported to be dominant in 7 countries and co-dominant with influenza
B in 12 countries. Influenza B was dominant in 6 countries. All of 32
pandemic A(H1N1) viruses resistant to oseltamivir remained sensitive
to zanamivir.

The EuroFlu website features an interactive map presenting
qualitative indicators of influenza activity (intensity, trend,
geographical spread, and impact) and the dominant virus as assessed by
each of the countries. This information can be accessed by clicking on
the individual countries in the map and readers are recommended to
make use of this facility. - Mod.CP]
