Ministry of Health Head of Communications and External Relations Stanslous Ngosa said in a statement that the number of cholera cases has now increased to 1045 since the disease broke out on 6 Oct 2017. Mr. Ngosa said a total of 96 patients are currently receiving treatment at various cholera centres in Lusaka district.

He has meanwhile said K34 million [USD 3.5 million] has been released by the Ministry of Finance towards the cholera response. He said the funds are being used to improve the availability of clean and safe water and improving sanitation, including solid waste management, health promotion and education, supporting and enforcement of the Public Health Act.

Mr. Ngosa added that community interventions have been intensified through increasing the number of volunteers and environmental staff.

He has since appealed to the public to observe basic rules of hygiene, boil water for drinking or add chlorine to it. He strongly discouraged residents from using water from shallow wells.

Mr. Ngosa has instead advised the residents in affected areas to use the toilet and to cooperate with health workers and all those working in the community to prevent cholera. He further advised the public to take anyone having diarrhea and vomiting to the nearest health facility without delay.

The number of people who have died following a cholera outbreak in Lusaka, the Zambian capital, has risen to 25, Zambia's health authorities said on Wed 20 Dec 2017.

Ministry of Health Head of Communications and External Relations Stanlous Ngosa said the city has recorded 50 new cases this week, bringing the total cases since the outbreak in October 2017 to 912. However, only 75 patients were currently admitted to various treatment centers in the city, he added.

The WHO recently warned of the further spread of the water-borne disease as the rainy season intensifies. The health ministry has announced measures to halt the further spread of the disease such as banning the sale of ready-to-eat foodstuffs on the streets. The disease is mainly concentrated in densely populated slums of Chipata and Kanyama, according to the ministry.

At least 4 persons have died in a fresh outbreak of cholera in Nasarawa state. The victims, who were from Shege, a village in Toto local government area of the state, were said to have died before they could reach the only primary healthcare center in the community. The Cable learnt that among those killed were a mother and her daughter.

According to a resident, people of the community have always "appealed to the state government for provision of motorized borehole [a well] to curb the spread of water-borne diseases."

Musa Abdullahi, public relations officer of the state ministry of health, said the situation is under control from spreading to other communities.

[4] Cholera - Kenya
Date: Mon 11 Dec 2017

http://www.who.int/csr/don/11-december-2017-cholera-kenya/en/


From 1 Jan 2017 - 29 Nov 2017, a total of 3967 laboratory-confirmed and probable cases including 76 deaths (case fatality rate = 1.9 percent) were reported by the Ministry of Health to WHO. Of the cases reported, 596 were laboratory confirmed.

From 1 Jan 2017 through 29 Nov 2017, 20 of 47 counties (43 percent) in Kenya have reported cases. As of 29 Nov 2017, 7 counties continue to have active cholera outbreaks (Embu, Garissa, Kirinyaga, Mombasa, Nairobi, Turkana, and Wajir).

The epidemiology of cholera for Kenya in 2017 is characterized by continuous transmission in affected communities coupled with outbreaks in camp settings and institutions or during mass gathering events. Continuous transmission in the community accounts for around 70 percent of the total cases with the majority of cases coming from the capital county, Nairobi. Transmission in camp settings occurred mainly within Garissa and Turkana counties, accounting for around 23 percent of the total reported cases. Both counties host big refugee camps, namely Dadaab and Kakuma refugee camps. Refugees in these camps come from countries currently experiencing complex emergencies and large cholera outbreaks. Seven percent of cases occurred in institutions and mass gathering events, where a number of people get infected from a point source.

The country experiences cholera outbreaks every year; however, large cyclical epidemics occur approximately every 5-7 years and last for 2-3 years.

The country has activated the national task force to coordinate the outbreak response activities. Since January 2017, WHO and other partners have been providing technical support to the country to control the outbreak. Following the development of the national response plan, WHO and other partners supported the country to scale-up outbreak response activities such as surveillance, case management, and social mobilization. This was also coupled with the improvement of food hygiene standards and promotion of safe food handling, besides scaling-up Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH) related activities. This resulted in a decline in the number of cholera cases.

Despite the decline in the number of cases reported, the outbreak appears to be clustered around 2 major types of settings. First, the refugee camps, particularly Kakuma and Dadaab, and 2nd in the populous Nairobi capital county. Both settings are concerning, considering the overcrowded conditions and limited access to care in the 1st setting, and the high population density in the 2nd setting. This could enable the spread of the outbreak to other districts. Also, previous outbreaks have shown that cases increase during the rainy season, which has started recently.

In addition, various physical, social, political, and environmental factors increase the vulnerability and the susceptibility of the country's population to the cholera outbreaks. These include regional drought, conflict, and insecurity in the Horn of Africa, and the increased movement within and to the country by people fleeing conflicts in Somalia and South Sudan.

Overall, the risk of the current outbreak is assessed as high at the national level and low at the regional and global levels.

WHO recommends proper and timely case management in cholera treatment centres. The affected communities should have improved access to water, effective sanitation, proper waste management, and enhanced hygiene and food safety practices. Key public health communication messages should be provided. WHO encourages travellers to the affected area to take proper hygiene precautions to prevent potential exposure.

WHO does not recommend any restriction on travel and trade to Kenya based on the information available on the current outbreak.

[5] Cholera - Malawi

Karonga District Council and other stakeholders working in the health sector are in dilemma over the fast spreading of a cholera outbreak in the district, where 2 people have died, with a total of 51 registered cases in 4 weeks. The district council and the stakeholders met Monday [18 Dec 2017] to discuss how they could contain the outbreak of the disease.

A report presented at the meeting by Karonga District Environmental Health Officer Lewis Tukula indicated that about 23 villages have been affected in all the 5 traditional authorities. "So far, we have registered 2 deaths and 51 cases within 4 weeks and most affected are females," said Tukula. Tukula said most of the cases have been registered within communities in the fishing camps of Nyungwe, Ngala, and Phapa.

"People in these areas do not have pit latrines and relieve themselves in the lake, yet they use the same lake as a source of water for consumption and other domestic uses. They do not use boreholes [deep wells], alleging that water drawn from the boreholes is salty, hence the outbreak," said Tukula. He, therefore, advised the general public to refrain from eating cold foods and practice hand-washing at the stipulated times, such as after using a toilet, before and after eating any food, after changing napkins, and proper use of toilets that have drop hole covers.

District Commissioner for Karonga, Richard Hara said the district would form a taskforce to tour all fishing camps in the district and engage communities in the fight against the outbreak.

The DC commended the stakeholders for contributing towards initiatives such as cholera public awareness campaigns and hygiene and sanitation promotion in a bid to contain the situation.

[The mortality from cholera and most diarrheal illnesses is related to non-replacement of fluid and electrolytes from the diarrheal illness.

As stated in Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In: Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in press), oral rehydration therapy can be life-saving in outbreaks of cholera and other forms of diarrhea:

"As reviewed by Richard Guerrant et al (1), it was in 1831 that cholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement, and, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not until 1960 was it 1st recognized that there was no true destruction of the intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could be effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the intravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could be just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (for example, refs 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy (ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact on the morbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant et al (1) highlights the use of oral glucose-salt packets in war-torn Bangladeshi refugees, which reduced the mortality rate from 30 percent to 3.6 percent (4) and quotes sources referring to ORT as "potentially the most important medical advance" of the 20th century. A variety of formulations of ORT exist, generally glucose or rice powder-based, which contain a variety of micronutrients, especially zinc (5).

"The assessment of the degree of volume loss in those with diarrhea to approximate volume and fluid losses can be found in ref 6 below. Those with severe hypovolemia should be initially rehydrated intravenously with a fluid bolus of normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution of 20-30 ml/kg followed by 100 ml/kg in the 1st 4 hours and 100 ml/kg over the next 18 hours with regular reassessment. Those with lesser degrees of hypovolemia can be rehydrated orally with a glucose or rice-derived formula with up to 4 liters in the 1st 4 hours, and those with no hypovolemia can be given ORT after each liquid stool with frequent reevaluation."
