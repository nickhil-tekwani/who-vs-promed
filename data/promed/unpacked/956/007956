Bluetongue In Algeria
-------------------------
(Date of previous outbreak of bluetongue (BT) in Algeria reported to
the OIE: July 2000).
Translation of information received on 24 Jul 2006 from Dr. Rachid
Bouguedour, Director of Animal Health Services, Ministry of
Agriculture and Rural Development, Algiers:
Report date: 23 Jul 2006.
Reason for immediate notification: reoccurrence of a listed disease
or infection in a country or zone/compartment following a report
declaring the outbreak(s) ended.
Identification of agent: serotyping in progress.
Date of start of the event: 12 Jul 2006.
Five outbreaks of bluetongue have been reported in ovine in El Bayadh
and Laghouat wilayas. The animals showed classical clinical signs of
the disease:
El Bayadh Wilaya
- Boualem outbreak: 5 cases and 2 deaths out of 120 susceptible animals.

[Obviously, from the number of previous reports, new bluetongue
activity is a cause of significant concern. To get a good overview of
the problem to date, please reference the summary 2005 report in
"Bluetongue, domestic ruminants, 2005 - Spain 20060223.0590," kindly
sent in by Pablo Nart. Mod.AS's comments in "Bluetongue, domestic
ruminants - Europe 20050205.0392," which are reproduced below, and
Peter Roeder's comments in "Bluetongue, upsurge - Mediterranean basin
20011122.2864" are useful.
Mod.AS's comments:
"Portugal has not reported any outbreaks during 2005; the last
outbreak there, according to Portugal's follow-up report No. 4 to the
OIE (14 Jan 2005), occurred in a sheep flock in Alentejo, starting 7
Dec 2004. Of 135 susceptible animals, 49 showed clinical signs, 22
died, and 113 were destroyed.

As recently summarized by Purce et al. [1], since its arrival in
Europe in 1998, BT has caused the deaths of more than one million
sheep. The epidemic began during October 1998, when BTV-9 was
detected on 4 Greek islands close to the Turkish coast (Rhodes,
Leros, Kos and Samos). In subsequent years, up to 2004, BTV-9 spread
northward (into western regions of Turkey, Bulgaria, Kosovo, Albania,
Bosnia and Herzegovina, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia,
Serbia and Montenegro, and Croatia) and westward (into mainland
Greece, Italy, Sicily, Sardinia and Corsica). A further 3 serotypes,
BTV-1, BTV-4 and BTV-16, also entered Europe from the east (through
Greece) and then spread westwards. A separate incursion of BTV-2 also
occurred in 2000, spreading from Tunisia and/or Algeria into
Sardinia, Sicily, mainland Italy, Corsica and the Balearic islands.
In late 2004, further incursions (this time of BTV-4) occurred from
Morocco into southwestern Spain and southern Portugal. This last
outbreak is expected to be terminated by now, following the seasonal
pattern, related to the annual fall in temperatures, as observed in
other BT-infected Middle-Eastern countries for decades.
The outbreaks involving Spain and Portugal were caused by BTV
serotype 4. Its recurrence next season (generally, commencing in
July/August) cannot be predicted at this stage. Some serotypes have
now persisted for up to 6 years in parts of Europe, a pattern that is
consistent with frequent over-wintering as opposed to re-incursion of
particular strains.

with BT spread into and within Europe:

bluetongue in Europe. Nature Reviews Microbiology 3, 2, 171-181 (2005).
