Researchers in north eastern China discovered a new segmented RNA virus associated with febrile illness in dozens of patients, and they suspect that the virus is transmitted by ticks, according to a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine. They named the previously unknown pathogen the Alongshan virus (ALSV).

"ALSV infection can cause clinical disease, and, therefore, it should be differentiated from other tickborne diseases, such as severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome, tickborne encephalitis, anaplasmosis, rickettsiosis and babesiosis," Quan Liu, from Foshan University in Guangdong Province and the Academy of Military Medical Sciences in Jilin Province, told Infectious Disease News.

According to the study, routine tickborne disease surveillance identified a 42 year old female farmer who presented to a hospital in Inner Mongolia with symptoms similar to those of infectious tickborne encephalitis virus (TBEV). Liu and colleagues collected a blood sample from the patient but did not find TBEV RNA or antibodies against the virus.

Because of the similarity of the patient's symptoms to those caused by a tickborne pathogen, the hospital initiated a heightened surveillance program to identify patients with a history of tick bites or bite-related symptoms. Liu and colleagues took serum specimens from patients and 100 healthy people living in the area, and collected local ticks and mosquitoes for testing, according to the study.

Reverse transcription-PCR testing confirmed ALSV in 86 patients from Inner Mongolia and Heilongjiang Province who presented with fever, headache and a history of tick bites, the researchers found. Among them, 73% were men, 98% were farmers or forestry workers, and 95% had "a clear history" of prior tick bites before disease onset, Liu and colleagues reported. According to the study, seroconversion occurred in all 19 patients with specimens available from the acute and convalescent phases of their illness.

Liu and colleagues reported that _Ixodes persulcatus_ ticks -- taiga ticks -- collected from areas where patients were bitten also tested positive for ALSV RNA. "We suspect that ALSV is transmitted by the tick _I. persulcatus_," Liu and colleagues wrote. "Common hosts of _I. persulcatus_ include most mammals (such as sheep, cattle, horses, dogs, rabbits, humans) and occasionally some birds. _I. persulcatus_ is widely distributed in Asia and eastern Europe, including China, Korea, Japan, Mongolia, and Russia."

The researchers said they cannot exclude mosquitoes as a possible vector of the virus and that more studies are needed to determine the geographic distribution of ALSV. Thus far, Liu and colleagues said they have found no epidemiologic evidence of person-to-person transmission of the virus.

Ze-Dong Wang, Bo Wang, Feng Wei, Shu-Zheng Han, Li Zhang, Zheng-Tao Yang, et al. A new segmented virus associated with human febrile illness in China. N Engl J Med. 2019; 380: 2116-2125, DOI: 10.1056/NEJMoa1805068.

Abstract

Background
In 2017, surveillance for tickborne diseases in China led to the identification of a patient who presented to a hospital in Inner Mongolia with a febrile illness that had an unknown cause. The clinical manifestation of the illness was similar to that of tickborne encephalitis virus (TBEV) infection, but neither TBEV RNA nor antibodies against the virus were detected.

Methods
We obtained a blood specimen from the index patient and attempted to isolate and identify a causative pathogen, using genome sequence analysis and electron microscopy. We also initiated a heightened surveillance program in the same hospital to screen for other patients who presented with fever, headache, and a history of tick bites. We used reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) and cell-culture assays to detect the pathogen and immunofluorescence and neutralization assays to determine the levels of virus-specific antibodies in serum specimens from the patients.

Results
We found that the index patient was infected with a previously unknown segmented RNA virus, which we designated Alongshan virus (ALSV) and which belongs to the jingmenvirus group of the family Flaviviridae. ALSV infection was confirmed by RT-PCR assay in 86 patients from Inner Mongolia and Heilongjiang who presented with fever, headache, and a history of tick bites. Serologic assays showed that seroconversion had occurred in all 19 patients for whom specimens were available from the acute phase and the convalescent phase of the illness.

Conclusions
A newly discovered segmented virus was found to be associated with a febrile illness in north eastern China. (Funded by the National Key Research and Development Program of China and the National Natural Science Foundation of China.)

[This interesting finding of a new flavivirus, Alongshan virus, opens the door for future studies. Although the virus was found in _Ixodes persulcatus_, the authors are prudent in suggesting but not concluding that this tick is the vector. One hopes that transmission studies in the laboratory will establish vector capacity of this tick. Similarly, serological studies of domestic and wild animals may provide clues about the vertebrate hosts of the virus, followed by determination of the magnitude and duration of viremia in suspected hosts. Further clinical studies of infected humans will also be of interest. - Mod.TY
