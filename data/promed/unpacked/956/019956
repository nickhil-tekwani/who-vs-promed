As of press time, the dreaded dengue fever already claimed 3 lives in
Iloilo City. However, the City Health Office (CHO) said it is far from
alarming. There were already 10 reported cases of dengue fever in the city
from January to June 2006.The said number is lower compared to the same
period of 2005, when there had been 40 cases. There remained many similar
cases, but they were not yet confirmed.
While there were no deaths caused by dengue fever during Jan-Jun 2005,
there were already 3 dengue-related during the first half of 2006. These
include a girl, age 5, of Barangay Gustilo, La Paz, a boy, age 15 of
Barangay Lanit, Jaro and the recently reported death of a girl from
Calaparan, Molo.
The district which has the most number of confirmed dengue cases was Jaro
(5), La Paz (2), and one each for Molo, Arevalo and City Proper areas.
Instead of being alarmed, City Mayor Jerry P. Trenas urged city residents
to do massive cleanup activities in their areas to avoid the breeding of
mosquitoes carrying dengue fever. He also asked village officials to
initiate cleanup programs.
Meanwhile, the province of Iloilo already has reported 27 dengue cases. The
Provincial Health Office (PHO) revealed that the towns of San Dionisio and
Sara have the largest number of confirmed dengue cases with 5. Estancia and
San Joaquin with 3 confirmed cases each; Duenas, Pototan and Zarraga with 2
each and Concepcion, Miag-ao, Oton, San Enrique and San Miguel with one
case each.
The PHO revealed there was no confirmed death caused by dengue fever in the
province. It concluded that the number of dengue cases is also not
alarming. [Although perhaps not alarming, the occurrence of 3 DHF deaths
among 27 reported cases is of concern. It would also be of interest to know
which dengue virus serotypes were circulating in the affected areas at the
time these cases were reported. - Mod.TY]

Ho Chi Minh City has so far in 2006 reported some 3000 cases of
mosquito-borne dengue fever with 2 people reportedly perishing, leaving the
southern hub ranked as the city hit hardest by the pandemic.
In the first 6 months of the year, Vietnam recorded around 20 000 cases of
dengue fever, up 54 percent from the corresponding period last year,
according to figures released by the Bureau of Preventive Health.
The disease is most common during the peak rainy season (May-November) in
the Mekong Delta provinces such as Kien Giang, An Giang, Ca Mau, Tien Giang
and Ho Chi Minh City.
The Ministry of Health recently instructed affected provinces and cities to
deploy necessary movements such as cleaning up the environment and training
medical personnel to curb the pandemic.
People are also advised to take necessary precautions to avoid mosquito
bites, as the pests are the main carrier of the disease. Dengue fever is
fatal in about 5 percent of cases, mostly among children and young adults.

June 2006 ended with 373 autochthonous dengue cases in the capital (Sao
Paulo), about 10 times the number of cases in the same period of 2005,
close to the number found in 2002, when the country suffered the highest
number of cases. The cold weather of winter kills the mosquitoes but its
eggs remain dormant, deposited at the edges of water-holding receptacles,
capable of surviving for more than an year, hatching when the humidity and
temperature rise.
In 2006 a new phenomenon occurred: there is no epidemic in the country. The
total number of imported cases is 549, a little higher than the number of
autochthonous cases. Apart from this, for the first time serotype 3 was
found in Sao Paulo, which can cause hemorrhagic forms of the disease in
persons with previous infection by other dengue virus serotypes.

[This news is rather imprecise. There has been an increase in dengue cases
throughout Brazil in 2006. Usually the months of March and April are when
the highest number of cases occur. In the state of Sao Paulo alone, there
were 17 654 confirmed dengue cases up to June 30, a number not seen since
2002, when the state experienced the worst dengue epidemic in its history,
with more than 50 000 confirmed cases.
The capital city of Sao Paulo state, also named Sao Paulo, is not a place
badly hit by dengue. The 390 cases confirmed this year (official figure) as
of June 30 is unusual, but far from an epidemic, as the city has around 10
million inhabitants (the metropolitan area has around 20 million). Numbers
from the rest of the country are not available for 2006, but fragmentary
data show that dengue epidemics are occurring in different parts of the
country.
Dengue virus, serotype 3 has been identified in the state of Sao Paulo
since 2002; the fact that it was found in the city is not remarkable. -

At least one person died and over 100 others have been infected as dengue
fever resurfaced in the Bangladeshi capital Dhaka during the last 3 days, a
health ministry control room said on Saturday.
An emergency doctor in the Holy Family Hospital confirmed the death of a
dengue patient and said everyday they are receiving many new patients of
dengue in the hospital.
Dr ASM Raihan in the Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University on
Saturday said the dengue outbreak this time was a bit earlier due to the
scattered rains. He said the _Aedes_ mosquito, responsible for carrying the
virus, might grow due to the scattered rains.
"The number of patients is increasing every day in the university
hospital," Dr Raihan said. He said the number of dengue patients
comparatively was more than that of the previous year and these patients
are getting admitted to different hospitals and clinics.
Raihan could not give the exact number of patients, but said everyday many
patients are falling ill with the fever and being admitted to different
hospitals and clinics.
In Bangladesh during the monsoon, the deadly dengue surfaces almost every
year and kills scores of people annually.

The official count in the number of dengue infection cases has risen to 15,
as per the record books of the Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC).
The civic health department today added to its list the name of a resident
of ward 119 in Behala who was brought to the Balananda Brahmachari Hospital
with high fever on 29 Jun 2006. Subsequent blood tests confirmed that he
was suffering from dengue.
The health department of KMC has suggested that this infection be
considered an "imported case". "He had arrived in the city on 25 Jun 2006
after a prolonged stay in Bihar. The incubation period of the dengue virus
(the period between the virus' entry into the human body and the detection
of symptoms) is usually 8-10 days.
"Our probe suggests that he had to be admitted to hospital in less than a
week's time. This prompts us to believe that he brought the infection from
Bihar," said Dr DD Chattopadhyay, chief municipal health officer.
Dey said the KMC health officials have been urged to take the "dengue
awareness and control programme" in right earnest. "Some officials don't
understand the importance of the exercise. We want a motivated staff," said
Dey. "The state health department told us that it shall make all necessary
arrangements in 4 city hospitals -- Calcutta Medical College and Hospital,
National Medical College and Hospital, RG Kar and NRS Hospital -- for free
dengue tests," Dey added.

Children at Yezagyo Township, Magwe Division in central Burma have been ill
due to an outbreak of dengue fever, and a 4-year-old girl died as a result
on 8 Jul 2006, according to local residents.
The child was transferred to nearby Pakokku hospital as the local hospital
was unable to cope and she died at the hospital. Around 20 children with
dengue fever symptoms are also receiving medical treatments at Yezagyo
hospital, a health staff on duty told DVB, but refused to confirm the
figure on fatality.
A local resident said that not fewer than 2 children had died as the result
of the outbreak. The authorities are reminding people not to let themselves
bitten by mosquitoes and to clear rotten drainage systems so that
mosquitoes could not breed. Health authorities are also planning to inspect
the region tomorrow.
The authorities should have carried out preventative measures before the
outbreak started, said an unnamed doctor from Yezagyo.
The report of the death follows another report of the death of child at
nearby Yenanggyaung due to the outbreak there.
