A total of 22 cases of acute diarrhea have been reported in Hanoi
since the health ministry announced 25 Dec 2007 that the epidemic had
been contained. Minister of Health Nguyen Quoc Trieu Monday [7 Jan
2008] said further that 17 of the 22 cases had tested positive for
severe acute diarrhea.
The health ministry has urged the local government to instruct health
and other officials to thoroughly inspect hygiene and safety at food
production facilities and pumping stations supplying water to the
city.
After severe acute diarrhea was first detected in October 2007 in
Hoang Mai precinct, a series of outbreaks hit the rest of the city.
It spread to 13 northern provinces and cities, affecting more than
1900 people. Of these, 295 tested positive for cholera.

[Severe acute diarrhea can be a synonym for cholera. It is not clear
how many of the new cases are indeed infections related to _Vibrio
cholerae_. Hanoi in the north of Viet Nam can be found on a map of

Since the start of the current cholera outbreak in Mozambique in
October 2007, 12 people have died from the disease, according to
Health Ministry statistics cited in the Friday [11 Jan 2008] issue of
the independent newssheet "Mediafax."
The 1st cholera case was diagnosed in Maputo on 8 Oct 2007. By
Thursday [10 Jan 2008] morning, the number of diagnosed cases stood
at 1396. Almost half of these cases, 673, occurred in Maputo city; 7
of these patients died. Maputo province reported 346 cases and 3
deaths. The other areas affected were Cabo Delgado in the far north
(138 cases and 1 death), and the central province of Sofala (133
cases and 1 death).
Cholera is endemic in Mozambique, and there are outbreaks,
particularly in urban areas, almost every rainy season. The number of
cases, however, does seem to be declining. Thus in 2006, 5431 cases
were diagnosed, of whom 24 died. This compares with 20 000 cases and
117 deaths in 2004 (and 15 000 cases and 113 deaths in 2003).
