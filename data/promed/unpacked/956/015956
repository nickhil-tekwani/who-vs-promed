[The spread of the LSD virus to the cattle population of Azerbaijan is not surprising, following the reports of its circulation in neighbouring Iran. Iran has submitted its 2nd follow-up report on 17 Jul 2014, giving information about the 1st occurrence of LSD in the province of Kermanshah. The total number of LSD outbreaks reported from western Iran, bordering Iraq, since the start of the event on 24 May 2014 is 4 (see, with map, at http://tinyurl.com/kgf5fgj.

According to the FAO's "Emergence of lumpy skin disease in the Eastern Mediterranean Basin countries," EMPRES WATCH, Vol. 29, Nov 2013: "Uncontrolled livestock movements heighten the risk that LSD may move into additional areas of Turkey or LSD-free countries within the region. Examples include the documented, large, seasonal Kurdish transhumance movements in the southeast Anatolia region. In addition, riverine agriculture and related activities at the deltas of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers in Iraq have a potential to be hot spots for vector transmission. There is an immediate risk of LSD incursion into the Islamic Republic of Iran and the trans-caucasus countries." See complete document at http://www.fao.org/docrep/019/aq706e/aq706e.pdf.

To view the distribution of LSD (2013/2014) in the regional context, go to the OIE interactive map at http://tinyurl.com/o9um9nl; for individual outbreaks in each of the affected countries, zoom in. Note the absence of information from Syria and the distance between the outbreaks reported in Iran and in Azerbaijan (a need for enhanced surveillance in northwest Iran?). Hopefully, Azerbaijan will soon obtain diagnostic kits needed for confirmation of clinical observations and for further surveillance (see their epidemiological commentary).

In view of LSD reported from south Azerbaijan and the circulation of the virus in eastern Turkey, enhanced surveillance in Armenia deserves to be considered. - Mod.AS/CRD
