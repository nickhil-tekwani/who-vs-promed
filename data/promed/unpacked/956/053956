Sapovirus [SaV] cases confirmed in Taipei County, CDC says
----------------------------------------------
The Centers for Disease Control (Taiwan CDC) reported yesterday [12
Jun 2007] that 55 faculty members of a college in Taipei County had
been diagnosed with Sapovirus infections, the 1st known cases of such
infections in Taiwan [see official government press release on this
outbreak available at:
<http://english.www.gov.tw/TaiwanHeadlines/index.jsp?recordid=33148&action=CNA>
- Mod.MPP]. Sapoviruses are caliciviruses which, together with the
noroviruses, are the leading causes of acute viral gastroenteritis in
humans. The virus is named after Sapporo, Japan, where the virus was
first recognized during an outbreak at an orphanage. It generally
causes only mild gastroenteritis in young children.
CDC officials said that the virus is hard to diagnose and that the
center only became capable of testing for the virus after cooperating
last year with Japan's National Epidemiological Surveillance of
Infectious Diseases. The officials said they were not ruling out the
possibility that others might have been infected with the virus at an
earlier date, but that such an outbreak had gone unrecognized.
Officials said they were notified by the Taipei County Government
Department of Health last month [May 2007] that a cluster of 55
people had exhibited symptoms of nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, and
that the possibility of food poisoning had initially been ruled out.
Fecal specimens from 8 infected people were sent to a laboratory for
a series of tests that presented negative results to the initial
battery of tests. The samples were then retested using the recently
developed test for Sapovirus and 7 of the 8 showed a positive result.
Officials said the virus is often transmitted through feces and oral
contact, and that cases often arise in nurseries and kindergartens,
but only rarely in colleges and universities. Little research has
been done on Sapovirus, and the prevalence rate is unclear, officials
said.
They urged the public to wash their hands and maintain a healthy diet
and good personal hygiene to avoid contracting the virus.

[This Sapovirus (SaV) outbreak is the 1st one found in Taiwan.
Sapporo virus (SV) is difficult to differentiate among other
food-borne diseases, therefore laboratory confirmation procedures are
necessary to find the source of infection and lead for outbreak
investigation as well. This will be very interesting about sources of
infection, especially about traveling histories among the patients or
food-handlers for those patients.
The following information about Sapovirus (SaV) can be found at
<http://pathport.vbi.vt.edu/pathinfo/pathogens/Sapovirus.html>:
"Sapporo-like viruses, (genus Sapporo-like virus, family
Caliciviridae), are a causative agent of acute gastroenteritis. The
caliciviruses derived from humans have been formerly classified into
2 distinct types, the small round structured virus (SRSV) and the
classical calicivirus, on the basis of their morphological features.
In the report of the Seventh International Committee on Taxonomy of
Viruses, the family Caliciviridae was divided into the following four
genera: Vesivirus, Lagovirus, Norwalk-like viruses (NLV) and
Sapporo-like viruses (SLV). The Norwalk virus and Sapporo virus are
the type species of NLV and SLV, respectively (Okada et al., 2002 --
ref.1). Human SaVs are primarily associated with 1.8 to 9 percent of
cases of pediatric acute gastroenteritis (Wang et al., 2005 -- ref
2). Human sapoviruses (SVs), formerly known as Sapporo-like viruses,
are single-stranded positive sense RNA viruses in the family
Caliciviridae. Other genera in the same family include Norovirus,
Lagovirus, and Vesivirus. Genetically, SV is divided into 5
genogroups (genogroup I [GI], GII, GIII, GIV, and GV). GI, GII, GIV
and GV infect humans while GIII infects porcine species (Chan et al.,
2006 -- ref. 3)
"Sapporo virus (SV) was 1st named after its discovery in an outbreak
of gastroenteritis in a home for infants in Sapporo, Japan, in
October 1977. Morphologically similar viruses were detected in a
subsequent series of outbreaks in the same institution between 1977
and 1982. They have a typical 'Star-of-David' configuration by EM and
are antigenically identical to each other by immune EM (IEM) (Chiba
et al., 2000 -- ref. 4). The Sapporo virus (SV) was one of the first
HuCVs [human calciciviruses] with classical morphology to be
characterized as antigenically distinct from NV and to be partially
characterized at the sequence level (Green et al., 2000 -- ref. 5)." - Mod.KS]

As this is a relatively newly recognized virus responsible for
outbreaks of gastroenteritis, one wonders if we will be hearing more
about outbreaks due to this virus as the awareness to look for the
virus increases. - Mod.MPP]
