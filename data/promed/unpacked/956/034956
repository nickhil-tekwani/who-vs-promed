Foot and mouth disease in South Africa
----------------------------
Virus type SAT 2 in the FMD controlled area (follow-up report No. 2)
See also: 16 Jul 2004, 9 Jul 2004, 2 Jul 2004, 15 Aug 2003
Information received on 19 Jul 2004 from Dr Emily Mmamakgaba Mogajane,
Assistant Director General, National Regulatory Services, National
Department of Agriculture, Pretoria:
End of previous report period: 9 Jul 2004 (see Disease Information, 17
[29], 192, dated 16 Jul 2004).
End of this report period: 19 Jul 2004.
Following the detection of cases of foot and mouth disease (FMD), strict
movement control of all cloven-hoofed animals and their products was
instituted by means of road blocks in the whole of the surrounding area
(Surveillance Area) with a complete embargo on all movements from the
affected areas of the Buffer and Surveillance Zones (Quarantine Area).
Since 7 Jul 2004, only another 3 diptank epidemiological units have been
found to be infected. These are all within the declared Quarantine Area,
where there is a complete movement embargo on cloven-hoofed animals and
their products. The spread of the disease has thus been slowed down
considerably.
Furthermore, despite intensive surveillance during the second (5-11 July)
and third (12-18 July) weeks of the outbreak, with mouthing [mouth
inspection?] of animals at all inspection points, no infected animals were
found in the previously declared Free Zone without Vaccination. Intensive
surveillance has revealed no evidence of the infection anywhere in the
declared FMD Free Zone without Vaccination, including the small part of the
Free Zone that was cordoned off and excluded from national and
international trade as part of the Surveillance Area created to control the
current outbreak.
The infected area therefore remains confined to portions of the previously
declared Buffer and Surveillance Zones.
The communities, organized agricultural structures and authorities are very
supportive of the intensified efforts by the national and provincial
veterinary authorities to contain the outbreak and to prevent any undue
effects on the agricultural industry as a whole.
Source of agent / origin of infection: the source of infection is most
probably direct contact between cattle and African buffalo that
occasionally escape from the adjacent game reserve in the infected zone.
The overpopulation of elephants in the Kruger National Park, due to the
embargo on the culling programme since 1994, has escalated the number of
breaks in the boundary fences, resulting in an increased frequency of
escapes by non-fence-breaking species, such as buffaloes.

Foot-and-mouth disaster looms
------------------------------
A disaster and the loss of millions of rands is threatening the Letaba
Valley area in Limpopo after the dreaded foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] broke
through the buffer zone next to the Kruger National Game Park. This comes
about 3 weeks after an outbreak of the disease in a dip tank in a
controlled area south of the Letaba River.
The situation has since worsened to such an extent that even yoghurt and
cheese are being confiscated from farm labourers at road blocks.
Dr Theo de Jager of AgriLetaba in Tzaneen told Beeld on Wednesday that a
broken fence on a government farm possibly led to the spread of the disease
outside the controlled area. The fence between the Letaba Ranch and the
controlled area has been broken for the past 3 months.
There have been problems in the past with this broken fence. The area is
continuously monitored for FMD. "We have a file as thick as the Bible in
which we have asked the government up to 3 times a month to fix the fence
because FMD spreads so quickly." He said the outbreak of the disease
outside the buffer zone came from infected animals that had moved through
the broken fence.
Segoati Mahlangu of the national department of agriculture said on
Wednesday the fence was monitored and repaired regularly. "We can't help it
if elephants break it or if poachers cut it. We repair it regularly." He
said the outbreak was under control and it was still within the buffer zone
of 25km alongside the game reserve and in the quarantine area of 15 to 30km
between Giyani and Phalaborwa.
However, De Jager said the area was much larger than this. "It stretches
from Giyani, past the Letaba Dam, Mooketsi, Tzaneen to Gravelotte. It
includes thousands of hectares." He said the effect of the outbreak was
being underestimated.
Millions of rands worth of citrus in the Letaba region could be withheld
from export because of the disease. De Jager said that although citrus
products were seldom affected by the disease, countries to which South
Africa exported could place a ban on imports. "Japan, China, the United
States and the European Union have very strict import rules. Farmers are
concerned because we are in the middle of the export season."
In addition, millions of rands are being lost by the hunting industry, as
hunters are not allowed in this area. De Jager said that during 2003
foreign hunters spent more than R500m in this region alone. Now, not even
meat was being allowed out of the area. Meanwhile, the 1st round of
vaccinations against FMD was completed in the area on Wednesday, said
Mahlangu. No deaths among animals with the disease had been reported so
far. Meat and dairy products have been confiscated at 42 roadblocks in the
area. Regular inspections of cattle, cloven-hoofed animals as well as meat
are being carried out constantly.

[One gets a very different view of the situation from the 2 postings. The
official OIE information indicates "only another 3 diptank epidemiological
units" have been infected since 7 July. (For those of you wondering, this
is probably the most appropriate epidemiologic unit for the extensive type
cattle production system referred to in this report). Since the
abbreviation for FMD can accurately be interpreted as Fast Moving Disease,
3 additional diptanks in over 2 weeks' time, while of concern, does not
constitute rapid and disastrous spread. Adding to the overall level of
concern is the previous inclusion of a "small piece" of the Free Zone as
part of the Surveillance area. Incorporating a "piece" of the Free Zone
rather than the whole Free Zone in the Quarantine Area is definitely an
appropriate use of geography to direct the epidemiologic approach.
Concurrently, however, the inclusion of any part of the Free Zone makes
everyone understandably anxious whenever any new occurrence is reported
even outside the Free Zone.
Interestingly, just as in the case of the U.K. epidemic in 2001, the 2nd
report indicates that economic effects in non-animal production segments
may take as great a monetary toll as the actual damage caused by the
disease itself. - Mod.PC]
