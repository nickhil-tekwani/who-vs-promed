African swine fever [ASF] has infected 185 pigs on a farm in Wuhu City in eastern China's Anhui province, the Ministry of Agriculture said on Thursday [30 Aug 2018]. The infection killed 80 of 459 hogs on a farm in Wuhu's Nanling County.

Transport of hogs and related products has been banned in the affected area, said a notice on the ministry's website.

[Since 3 Aug 2018, 4 ASF outbreaks have been officially reported by the OIE, namely (in chronological order) Liaoning, Henan, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang. In addition, the location of a live market in Jiamtsu, Heilongjiang province, "where pigs infected in the 2nd outbreak (Henan) came from," was published. The named 5 provinces and Ainhu, the province added in the current report, all in eastern China, are presented in China's administrative map at https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e9/China_administrative_alt.svg.

[2] Expert opinion on China's ASF situation

Since the 1st of August, in less than a month, a total of 4 outbreaks have been reported in China in the provinces Liaoning, Henan, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang. [But see added 5th province, in item 1. - Mod.AB]. That may not sound like a lot if you compare it to the spread of porcine epidemic diarrhoea (PED) in the USA a few years ago or even the continuing reports of outbreaks of African swine fever (ASF) in middle and eastern Europe.

Every report by the World Organization of Animal Health (OIE) as well as Reuters mentions the determination of the Chinese authorities to deal with the challenge as quickly as possible, and large amounts of culls are being reported in the direct vicinity around outbreak spots to avoid further spread. Yet, there are a few reasons to be gravely worried that this is going to be much bigger, not only in China, but also in the remainder of Asia. I hope I am wrong, but I don't think so. Here is why.

1. History of ASF in China
It looks like August does not constitute the onset of African swine fever in China at all. There is a serious study on the web stating that the virus has been around in China since at least June [2018], and other sources even mention April [2018]. Even if stringent measures were taken after the discovery, it looks like the virus had the chance to spread through the country relatively "unnoticed" for at least 2 months.

On top of that, the origin of the batch that was confirmed at the slaughterhouse in Henan province came originally from Heilongjiang province, close to Russia. How long did the virus circulate there before it was picked up?

2. The speed of the spread is worrying
In Europe, to travel from Georgia to the Czech Republic, a distance of almost 3000 km [about 1864 mi], it took the virus 11 years, from 2007 until 2018. In China, however, the virus spread from Shenyang in northern China to Wenzhou, south of Shanghai, in about 3 weeks. That equals a distance of 2100 km [about 1305 mi].

3. Look at the spread pattern in Europe
In eastern and middle Europe, most of the outbreaks have followed a pattern of dissemination in local wild boar population, after which it mostly stayed local or creeped further. This is mostly because the ASF virus combines high mortality with a low contagiousness (it requires physical contact for the virus to transmit). What emerged was local wild boar populations being infected and the odd farm in the same region, but outbreak zones hardly moved.

Every so often, the virus would pop up 500 km [about 311 mi] down the road, most likely because humans took infected pork with them on their travels. So far, in eastern Europe, the virus could not be stopped. It looks like what happened at a relatively slow pace in Europe is now unfolding at enormous speed in China.

4. China's pig density
Half of the world's pigs -- around 457 million in 2016 -- are in China, according to data of the FAO. As two-thirds of China is either mountainous or desert, this magnitude of pigs can be found mainly in the eastern one-third, sharing this space with 1.3 billion humans. Wherever ASF will be found, culling operations will always include many pigs.

5. Still many backyard farms
China, as often stated, is a country that is in transition. On its way to industrialisation and modernisation, people leave the countryside and move to the cities. It doesn't mean, however, that all is already "converted." Recently, Dr John Strak estimated in his overview that by the end of 2017, 52 percent of the Chinese herd still existed in backyard farms. Huge developments, but this means that half of the pigs in China are still kept in backyard conditions.

6. Many huge swine farms
It follows that 48 percent are then kept in modern farms. Some of these pigs are kept in farms modelled after European or American farms, in a large set-up and often with the principles of good biosecurity. The vast market has even invited the Chinese to build complexes that surpass anything seen in Europe or North America, like the multi-story swine farms. What will happen if ASF is confirmed near a complex like this?

7. One policy covering all ASF?
As professor Yang Hanchun pointed out mid-August in Science Magazine, the biggest challenge perhaps for the Chinese government is to implement one ASF policy that will cover all sections of the market, both backyard as well as developed swine farming. That will be a virtually impossible job given the sheer size of the country.

8. The understanding of the virus
And that brings me to how the Chinese themselves deal with the virus. To put it bluntly, everybody who is dependent on pigs to make a living of course knows about any disease the animals can have. But how about families who have kept a few pigs on the side for centuries? Do they know about a virus that wasn't officially present in China until a month ago?

9. The understanding of biosecurity
Are these backyard farmers suitably aware of biosecurity and the importance of it? When hearing about live pigs being transported from Heilongjiang province only to discover in Henan province that the animals were suffering from ASF, one can have doubts.

In addition, it wasn't that long ago (2013) when many dead pig carcasses were found floating in the Huangpu River, close to Shanghai, in what later turned out to be a mass collapse of the animals due to circovirus. Owners were afraid of the police and disposed of them in the water.

10. The weather doesn't help
To the element of biosecurity, another element can be added: that of nature. Just to illustrate, in late August 2018, a huge typhoon called "Rumbia" hit the Chinese east coast, with massive flooding as a result. The picture shows an affected greenhouses, but swine farms have also been affected, with dead animals as a result. It takes only one infected swine farm, and again, carcasses can float from place to place.

11. Availability of diagnostics and laboratories
Now let's assume that much has changed for the better since then. And even if owners do realise it is better to ask for help when the pigs suddenly start dying, will the way be found to the right laboratories, one that can confirm it is the ASF virus?

12. Transparency of the Chinese authorities
The paradox with open, transparent countries is that the more is being communicated about ASF outbreaks, the worse the situation appears, with potential negative trade consequences. Belarus, for instance, reported only 2 outbreaks of ASF in 2013 to the OIE, whereas all neighbouring countries had countless numbers of outbreaks. It remains to be seen how communicative the Chinese authorities will be. The rather unusual pattern of the outbreak (see points 2 and 3) suggests that perhaps more is going on than the authorities have communicated.

13. People complain on social media
That thought is reinforced by messages on WeChat. Sources in China tell me that many Chinese people are complaining about the lack of information.

14. There are wild boar in China too!
China does harbour wild boar as well. Even stronger, modern-day pigs are most probably a result of breeding efforts of indigenous wild boar in China. That, in theory, is a reservoir for ASF to stay. Should ASF follow the same pattern as in Europe? I wouldn't be surprised if wild boar are dying in China as well.

15. Ticks: the right climate
Apart from wild boar, the virus can also be transmitted by (sub-)tropical soft ticks. Not a problem in Europe, as there it is too cold for this type of tick. But in southern China, where the climate is warmer, that might be different. I'm told that China hosts over a 100 different species of ticks. Additional pig-producing countries to the south of China (even more tropical!) also like pork.
