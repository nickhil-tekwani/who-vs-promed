Fungal rot disease hits ginger crop
-----------------------------------
15 percent of the ginger crop has been infected with fungal rot disease in Shimoga district.

The symptoms of the disease are rotting of tubers [rhizomes] and yellowing of leaves. The affected plants will die in a few days. Last year [2013], ginger was cultivated on 12 500 acres of land in the district, the area increased to 15 000 acres this year [2014].

Deputy Director of Department of Horticulture M Vishwanath [said that] excess moisture in the weather was responsible. The infection was severe in ginger plots in low-lying areas. Fields in some villages had remained inundated for more than 10 days. Farmers have been asked to construct drainages in their fields to avoid water-logging, he said.

Mr Vishwanath said that farmers should treat the infected plants with metalaxyl [fungicide]. The Department of Horticulture has organised a series of awareness programmes to help farmers, he added.

[Fungal rhizome (soft) rots of ginger due to several pathogens (including _Fusarium_ and _Pythium_ species) have been reported from various locations. They are serious diseases which may lead to total crop losses. In India and the surrounding region, _Pythium_ species are most commonly reported as the cause of soft rot of ginger (as well as related crops like cardamom), with young shoots being most susceptible.

Symptoms generally include yellowing and wilting of leaves, rotting of leaf bases and rhizomes and eventually death of the plants. The pathogens are mostly soil borne and also spread with infected plant material (including seed rhizomes), water and by mechanical means. Rhizome rots are favoured by humid conditions and high soil moisture. Disease management may include the use of well-drained planting sites, crop rotation, preventative chemical treatments of rhizomes for planting and use of certified disease free planting material. However, in affected areas, even plants derived from disease-free rhizomes have a very high risk of being infected from local pathogen reservoirs.

All of the commercial ginger germplasm available today is highly susceptible to _Pythium_ soft rot, but the related ornamental _Zingiber zerumbet_ was identified as a potential source of genetic resistance.

Metalaxyl is a systemic fungicide used in the control of _Pythium_ and other soil borne fungi.

Bacterial rhizome rots (_Ralstonia_ and _Erwinia_ species) are also known to affect the crop with similar symptoms, and occasionally nematodes have also been reported to be associated with such diseases.

Rotting diseases ("koleroga") due to heavy rains are also currently affecting other crops such as coffee, cardamom and black pepper in the state (see link below).
