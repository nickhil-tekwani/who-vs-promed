Abstract
--------
Using viral metagenomics of brain tissue from a young adult crossbreed steer with acute onset of neurologic disease, we sequenced the complete genome of a novel astrovirus (BoAstV-NeuroS1) that was phylogenetically related to an ovine astrovirus. In a retrospective analysis of 32 cases of bovine encephalitides of unknown etiology, 3 other infected animals were detected by using PCR and in situ hybridization for viral RNA. Viral RNA was restricted to the nervous system and detected in the cytoplasm of affected neurons within the spinal cord, brainstem, and cerebellum. Microscopically, the lesions were of widespread neuronal necrosis, microgliosis, and perivascular cuffing preferentially distributed in gray matter and most severe in the cerebellum and brainstem, with increasing intensity caudally down the spinal cord. These results suggest that infection with BoAstV-NeuroS1 is a potential cause of neurologic disease in cattle.

[Background]
------------
Astroviruses are small, nonenveloped, positive single-stranded RNA viruses with a genome of 6.4-7.3 kb. The family _Astroviridae_ comprises 2 genera, _Mamastrovirus_ and _Avastrovirus_, known to infect mammals and birds, respectively. Since the 1st description of human astrovirus (HAstV) in children with diarrhea in 1975, a wide variety of astroviruses have been reported in multiple animals including humans, cattle, pigs, sheep, minks, dogs, cats, mice, sea lions, whales, chickens, and turkeys.

Enteric astroviruses are transmitted through the fecal-oral route, and regardless of species, most infections are asymptomatic. In humans, the prevalence of exposure is very high, and astrovirus infection is a major cause of acute enteritis in infants. Clinical disease also can affect elderly and immunocompromised persons. In these persons, the clinical course of infection is acute, with 2-4 days of watery diarrhea and, less commonly, vomiting, headache, fever, abdominal pains, and anorexia.

Astroviruses have been implicated twice in central nervous system (CNS) disease. One study demonstrated an HAstV-PS, which is distinct from the original HAstV and closely related to astrovirus HMO-C (AstV-HMO-C) and HAstV-VA1) in the brain tissue of a 15-year-old boy with X-linked agammaglobulinemia who had encephalitis. HAstV-PS was the only virus detected, and astrocyte infection was confirmed by anticapsid antibody staining. Serologic evidence of exposure to the closely related AstV-HMO-C was found in 36 percent of 5-10-year-old children in the United States, which reflects a common childhood infection and indicates that the encephalitis in this child was a likely consequence of his immunodeficiency. In an outbreak of so-called "neurological shaking disease" in mink, an astrovirus (Mink AstV-SMS) was detected in the brain tissues of multiple naturally and experimentally infected animals showing neurologic signs, including shaking and ataxia.

One hopes that these interesting findings will stimulate other, similar investigations of cattle with nervous system disease. It would be desirable for virus isolations to be made and a repository of them established to enable further studies of pathogenesis and genetic variability of any viruses encountered, and for comparative studies with astroviruses found in other species. Although not mentioned in the report above, interestingly, a laboratory in Hong Kong reported that astroviruses were also detected in a high proportion of insectivorous bats (see Chu DK et al. J Virol at: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18550669).
