Via: FSNET (D. Powell, Univ. Guelph):
According to a summary of this story (kindly provided by a FSnet reader --
dp) about 40 cases of the E-coli (EHEC) bacteria have been reported this
year in Sweden. Nearly a third of them have happened in the county of
Halland. A little boy have been affected seriously. He is in intensive care
with dialysis.
The most usual infections are coming from beef, unpasteurized milk and
vegetables, says Anders Lindberg, a disease control official in the county
of Halland.
