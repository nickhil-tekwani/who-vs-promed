A new case of TB in Mayenne (France)
--------------------------------
Two outbreaks of bovine tuberculosis have been detected in the past 3 months in the department of Mayenne (France). The cattle, 247 animals in total, were slaughtered, said the prefecture on Thursday [21 Feb 2013].

An outbreak of the disease was identified and confirmed by analysis in 67 bulls in Couesmes-Vauce, according to the prefecture of Mayenne, which states that the herd was killed on 14 Feb 2013.

"Before reintroducing animals, the premises will be disinfected. Compensation for animals slaughtered and fees for disinfection will be paid entirely by the state," the prefecture said.

The contamination of the farm followed the introduction of a bovine from a previous outbreak of infection in Mayenne, the prefecture indicated.

The contamination was 1st reported in November 2015 [?], in Asse-le-Beranger, in a herd of 180 cattle that were all slaughtered. A bull from the farm, however, had been included in the herd shot recently but its origin was only found later; at least that is what was explained to the prefecture.

"Bovine tuberculosis (_Mycobacterium bovis_) is potentially transmissible to humans," says the prefecture in a press release, noting that, however, "in France the percentage of human tuberculosis cases due to _Mycobacterium bovis_ was small."

[According to EU's Animal Disease Notification System (ADNS), France reported 10 outbreaks of bovine tuberculosis (bTB) in cattle during the period 1 - 31 Jan 2013. No other EU member has reported outbreaks of this disease during the said period.

The annual (herd) prevalence of bTB in cattle in France is currently about 0.07 percent; the annual incidence is about 0.04 percent. The disease is rare but it still occurs at low level in some areas; there is presence of the disease in wildlife in some of these areas.

France is "officially bTB free" since Dec 2000, according to international criteria ("at least 99.8 percent of the herds free"). Herd surveillance has been maintained in areas with historical background and in herds with high potential for spread (raw milk dairy farms).

According to Ref 1, France has been experiencing a resurgence of bTB since 2004. The rate of herd prevalence increased from 0.02 percent in 2004 to 0.07 percent in 2010. This increase, if continuing, could jeopardize the free status of France.
