The northern Mozambican province of Nampula has recorded so far 133 cases of cholera, after an outbreak that was 1st reported in January 2021 in the district of Meconta, which is also the epicentre of the disease.

Addressing a meeting of the Emergency Operational Centre (COE), at which the province's current epidemiological situation was presented, the Secretary of State for Nampula, Mety Gondola, said 52 patients are now hospitalized with cholera, but there have been no deaths.

"Taking into account the cumulative number of cases, we have declared a cholera outbreak in the district of Meconta. The situation is worrying, but we hope we can depend on everyone's support so that we can bring it under control," Gondola said.

Besides Meconta, he has also expressed concern with the growing number of diarrhea cases in Moma, Memba, and Erati districts, which might also be cholera, and urged the stakeholders to constantly share information about the spread of the disease. He said that health authorities are monitoring the movement of people in the affected districts, especially in the administrative post of Namialo, in Meconta. "We have stepped up the alert level, as we fear that some people might bring the disease to Nampula city and Monapo district," said Gondola.

Gondola added that the authorities must also attach great importance to other diseases affecting the province such as malaria and COVID-19.

He said the province is ready to provide the necessary assistance to the cholera patients, as Nampula has sufficient stocks of medicines for the next 3 months. "After an assessment of the stocks, we can firmly state that there are enough stocks and medical equipment available for the next 3 months," Gondola said, adding that a request for further medicines has been submitted to strengthen the province's capacity for at least 5 months.

[As stated in Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In: Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience; 2017, pp 113-127, oral rehydration therapy can be lifesaving in outbreaks of cholera and other forms of diarrhea:

"As reviewed by Guerrant et al. (1), it was in 1831 that cholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement, and, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not until 1960 was it 1st recognized that there was no true destruction of the intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could be effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the intravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could be just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (e.g., refs. 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy (ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact on the morbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant et al. (1) highlight the use of oral glucose-salt packets in war-torn Bangladeshi refugees, which reduced the mortality rate from 30% to 3.6% (4) and quote sources referring to ORT as "potentially the most important medical advance" of the 20th century. A variety of formulations of ORT exist, generally glucose- or rice powder-based, which contain a variety of micronutrients, especially zinc (5).

The assessment of the degree of volume loss in those with diarrhea to approximate volume and fluid losses can be found in ref 6 below. Those with severe hypovolemia should be initially rehydrated intravenously with a fluid bolus of normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution of 20-30 mL/kg followed by 100 mL/kg in the 1st 4 hours and 100 mL/kg over the next 18 hours with regular reassessment. Those with lesser degrees of hypovolemia can be rehydrated orally with a glucose or rice-derived formula with up to 4 liters in the 1st 4 hours, and those with no hypovolemia can be given ORT after each liquid stool with frequent reevaluation."
