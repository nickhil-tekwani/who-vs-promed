An Additional Comment on Hantavirus Infection in Slovenia
---------------------------------------------------------
Since Moderator Emeritus CHC finished his Invited Comment on Hantavirus
Infection in Slovenia [see: ProMED-mail post archived as "Hantavirus
infection - Slovenia 20020512.4187"] with the invitation for additional
comment, I have decided to write a short report.
Hantaviruses and hantavirus infection have been registered in Slovenia
since 1985. Broad epidemiological, clinical, and virological studies of
endemic regions revealed that hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS)
in Slovenia is caused by 2 hantaviruses: Dobrava virus and Puumala virus.
Further, we have demonstrated that Dobrava and Puumala viruses coexist in a
single region of endemicity and are capable of causing HFRS with
significant differences in severity.
In Slovenia, Puumala virus infections are usually presented with moderate
clinical manifestations; Dobrava virus infections generally have a severe
course with CFR of 8-10 percent. The major clinical complications seen in
HFRS patients in Slovenia are hemorrhagic manifestations and acute renal
failure, not the liver damage described in the ProMED-mail post of 10 May
2002 [Hantavirus infection - Slovenia 20020512.4187]; for a review see
Avsic et al.: CID 1999; 28:860-5.
In 1988 the prototype Dobrava virus was isolated from the lungs of [an
individual of the] natural reservoir rodent _ Apodemus flavicollis_,
captured in the village of Dobrava in Slovenia, where a number of severe
HFRS cases had occurred. Complete genetic and antigenic characterization
identified Dobrava virus as a unique hantavirus (for a review see Avsic,
Journal of General Virology 1995; 76:2801-8) which has been later
implicated as a causative agent of severe HFRS present in the Balkans.
The incidence of HFRS in Slovenia is modest, with the appearance of
epidemics in the years 1986, 1989, 1992, 1995, and 2000. From January 2002
until 14 May 2002 we have registered 8 clinically well-documented cases
including the 3 soldiers mentioned in the ProMED-mail report. All of the
cases were serologically confirmed and were [genotypically] identified as
Puumala virus infection. For the particular period of the year this means
an increased number of patients, which will probably lead to a new HFRS
epidemic year in this part of Europe. Since we are the WHO Collaborating
Centre for Arboviruses and Viral Hemorrhagic Fevers, we have received an
increased number of samples from suspected HFRS cases from Croatia, Bosnia,
and Herzegovina. The majority of the samples were confirmed as HFRS caused
by Puumala virus. Based on the information obtained from the Natural
History Museum of Slovenia, there is a huge increase of the small mammal
population this year. Therefore, we should expect more cases during the
coming months due the fact that HFRS infection caused by Dobrava virus has
its peak in summer and fall.

[ProMED-mail welcomes Dr Avsic-Zupanc's contribution, and in particular the
information that the 3 soldiers who were the subject of the original report
experienced infection with the less dangerous of the 2 hantaviruses
prevalent in Slovenia. It should be noted that Dobrava virus is now
designated Dobrave-Belgrade virus in the current (7th) Report of the
International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. - Mod.CP]
[Because of the relatively mild nature of their illnesses, the patients
mentioned in the BBC report were more likely to have been infected with
Puumala than with Dobrava hantavirus. That impression has now been
confirmed by Dr. Avsic.
It should be noted that the term "mild" is a relative one. Puumala virus
has been associated with what was once described as "the mild form" of
hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS). This is an excellent example
of the need for an exact, laboratory-based diagnosis, rather than having
merely a clinical impression.
Certain hantaviruses (examples: Hantaan virus, Dobrava virus) are more
often associated with severe HFRS than are other hantaviruses (e.g.,
Puumala virus). Nonetheless, if a patient with Puumala virus is severely
ill or dies from the infection, it is irrelevant whether we call this a
"mild" or "severe" form of disease. I cannot think of any virus that causes
a more severe illness outcome than death. The terms "mild" and "severe"
relate to the disease at the population level, so that if a high proportion
of patients have life-threatening illnesses, that would be considered
"severe", whereas if a low proportion of patients have life-threatening
illnesses, that would be considered "mild". Illnesses in patients dying of
Puumala virus infection or needing renal dialysis cannot be considered
"mild". Specific diagnosis is required for determination of likely
prognosis and for epidemiologic reasons.
In 2002, more than 50 cases of hantaviral infections have been detected by
excellent clinicians and laboratories in Croatia, Bosnia, and Slovenia.
Some of the patients involved have required renal dialysis, but all thus
far appear to have been victims of Puumala virus. This year seems to be
another hantaviral epidemic period for the Balkan region.
We are greatly indebted to Dr. Tatjana Avsic for providing ProMED-mail
readers with timely information and thorough discussion. - Mod Emeritus CHC]
