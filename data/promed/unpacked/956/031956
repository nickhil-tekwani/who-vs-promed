In China, a survey to assess the presence of _Grapevine Pinot gris virus_ (_Trichovirus_, GPGV) was carried out in 2014. 36 samples (dormant canes) were collected from the Chinese provinces of Liaoning (29 samples), Beijing (5), and Zhejiang (2). These samples included 24 different cultivars, in which 14 cultivars had showed chlorotic mottling.

Molecular tests (PCR) showed that 15 samples (out of 36) tested positive for GPGV. The PCR products obtained from [cultivars] 'Red Globe' (symptomless), 'Merlot' (symptomless), 'Muscat Hamburg' (symptomless), 'Cabernet Franc' (symptomatic) and 'Moldova' (symptomatic) were sequenced and showed high similarity when compared with 7 previously reported GPGV genomes.

During grafting experiments, it was also found that the cv. 'Beta' which is widely used as a rootstock in China may be susceptible to GPGV infection. This is the 1st time that GPGV is reported from China.

[_Grapevine Pinot gris virus_ (GPGV; genus _Trichovirus_) is a newly described virus of grapevine which was identified in Italy on grapevine cv. Pinot gris with symptoms of chlorotic mottling and leaf deformations. It was detected by new large scale sequencing methods ("deep sequencing") in co-infection with several other viruses and viroids. Therefore, it was initially not possible to clearly associate the virus with specific symptoms.

Amongst the grapevine viruses, GPGV appears to be most closely related to _Grapevine berry inner necrosis virus_ (GINV) of the same genus. Trichoviruses are mostly transmitted by grafting material and mechanical means, and GINV is also transmitted by a mite vector. Work is in progress to investigate symptomatology (alone and in co-infections), possible vectors, epidemiology and impact of GPGV.

Disease management of grapevine viruses and viroids may include phytosanitation, such as removal of infected plants and disinfection of vineyard tools. Use of certified clean planting material (including tissue cultures, rootstocks and scions for grafting) is essential.

GPGV has now been reported from Europe, North America and Asia. However, given the vegetative propagation methods used for grapevines, longevity of the host and historic international exchange of germplasm, it may be widely distributed in some or many commercial cultivars.
