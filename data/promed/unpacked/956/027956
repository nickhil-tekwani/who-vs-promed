PCB CONTAMINATION, SALMON - MULTICOUNTRY: BACKGROUND

Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) include a possible 209 chemically related
[compounds] of the biphenyl ring structure, where a chlorine molecule has
been substituted for hydrogen in one or more locations. Individual
chlorobiphenyls vary widely in their chemical reactivities and biological
effects, depending on the numbers and locations of chlorine [molecules] on
the ring.
PCBs do not occur naturally but enter the environment via industrial
synthesis and release from a variety of industrial uses. In the USA, PCBs
were sold as mixtures developed for their physical and electrical properties,
and were sold under the trade-name "Aroclor".
Generally, PCBs are relatively resistant to degradation, and their
persistence and toxicity to humans and marine organisms led to restrictions
in most countries. Through open-system applications and careless handling,
many tons of PCBs have been lost to the environment.
Physical-chemical properties of PCBs result in their [ad]sorption to and
incorporation in sediments, and they are found especially in urban harbors
and downstream from industrial activities that produced or used them.
PCBs have a half-life of several decades, are tightly bound to soil, and have
a natural "sink" in water beds as a result of erosion. They are also
semivolatile, are routinely measurable in air, rain, and snow at locations
remote from areas of high concentration, including at both poles. Because of
high lipid solubility, they bioaccumulate to a very high extent in fatty
tissues.
Recommendations
------------
The one meal per month restrictions are also currently in place for fish in
Pennsylvania and for fish and crabs in NJ. It is further recommended that
all skin and fat be removed prior to cooking and that fish be grilled over an
open rack to allow residual fat to drip free, and that juices or fat obtained
from the fish during cooking should not be eaten or reused to cook other
foods.
