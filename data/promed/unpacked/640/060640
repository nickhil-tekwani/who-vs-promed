["Since 2014, HPAI A(H5N6) has been responsible for widespread outbreaks in birds across China, Japan and South East Asia and in 2018 significant outbreaks have been reported from Mainland China, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Vietnam. The Philippines has also reported H5N6 in poultry. The virus is highly pathogenic in birds and has been isolated from both poultry and wild birds.

"In April 2014, the World Health Organization (WHO) 1st reported a case of human infection with avian influenza A(H5N6) from China. As of 24 Dec 2019, a total of 24 human cases of infection with avian influenza A(H5N6) have been reported from 10 different provinces across mainland China. Four of these cases were in children, 2 of whom had only mild illness. Of the remaining 20 adult cases, all had a severe illness and at least 15 were fatal.

"The majority of human cases of HPAI A(H5N6) in mainland China are known to have had contact with birds or their environments or exposure to suspected contaminated meat prior to becoming ill, and there is currently no evidence of human-to-human transmission. WHO considers that the H5 avian influenza viruses have not acquired the ability to transmit easily among humans and therefore the risk of sustained human-to-human transmission is low at present".
