If you intend to visit Mount Charleston, NV you'll need to take some
precautions. A plague warning is in effect there.
4 gray foxes that were trapped in Mount Charleston tested positive for
plague. The disease is transmitted to people through a fleabite or direct
contact with an infected animal. Health officials say if you're visiting
Mount Charleston you should wear long-sleeved shirts and pants and stay
away from wild animals.
Residents who live in the area are already taking precautions. Christopher
Olson, who lives on Mount Charleston, said, "I have heard that the rodents
here do have some type of infection, so we told the kids to stay away from
the mice and whether they're dead or alive."
Plague can be transmitted to humans through a fleabite or direct contact
with an infected animal. The symptoms are swollen glands, fever, chills,
headache, and extreme exhaustion. The Clark County Health District advises
anyone who visits the Mount Charleston area to avoid contact with rodents
and wild animals.
Health officials say if you take your pet up to Mount Charleston, don't let
them wander and keep a flea collar on them. If a human were to contract it,
if it's detected early, plague responds well to antibiotics.

[The introduction of plague into the US via California about a century ago
led to the spread of the infection eastward across about halfway across the
country. It did not reach the east coast. The infection continues to be
endemic in rodents in the southwestern parts of the US including Colorado,
New Mexico, Arizona, and California.
_Yersinia pestis_ is the agent responsible for bubonic plague. Endemic foci
of sylvatic plague exist in the western USA and several other areas of the
world. Fleas are the vectors primarily responsible for spreading _Y.
pestis_ from these reservoirs, although contact with infected rabbit
carcasses has been a significant source of infection for man during the
winter. Throughout history, outbreaks of human plague involving rats in
densely populated agricultural or urban areas have occurred when rats
commingled with infected sylvatic rodents.
Prairie dogs are often considered sentinel animals because of their
susceptibility to the organism. However, cats are extremely sensitive as
well and may be the source that exposes humans. The swollen lymph glands
may be mistaken for normal abscesses where a cat has been bitten. If one of
these buboes (swollen lymph glands) ruptures, it may be the source of
bacteria to people associated with the cat.
In humans, the bubo in the groin or under the arm is most common. However,
there may also be a systemic infection involving the lungs and,
consequently, transmission between people is possible. Pneumonic plague can
be recognized by the bloody sputum coughed up by patients that are TB-negative.
The flea vector of _Y. pestis_ would rather feed on its usual host, but in
the absence of a warm-blooded prairie dog, it may attempt to feed on a
human. Infection in the flea causes obstruction in the gastrointestinal
tract of the flea, which regurgitates the bacilli while attempting to
feed. In addition to warnings, other possible measures to curb outbreaks
include treating die-off areas with insecticides to kill the fleas.
Pet owners should be encouraged to keep their pets free of fleas. There are
a number of excellent products to combat fleas on your pets available from
your veterinarian; however, some such products may be toxic to cats. Pet
owners should consult their veterinarian about anti-flea products and
should thoroughly read the label of the product. - Mod.TG]
