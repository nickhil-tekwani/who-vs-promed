[Rabies is a viral disease that affects the central nervous system of mammals, including humans. The virus is particularly present in the saliva and brain of infected animals. It is transmitted via the saliva of an infected animal, most often a dog. The incubation period varies from several days to several months. Once symptoms are present, the disease is fatal for both animals and humans.

More than 95 percent of human cases of rabies are due to bites from infected dogs. Controlling and eradicating rabies, therefore, means combatting it at its animal source http://www.oie.int/en/animal-health-in-the-world/rabies-portal/about-rabies/.

Rabies can be found in dogs, bats, and other mammals in Lebanon, so CDC recommends this vaccine for the following groups, see https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/lebanon:

- Travelers involved in outdoor and other activities (such as camping, hiking, biking, adventure travel, and caving) that put them at risk for animal bites.
- People who will be working with or around animals (such as veterinarians, wildlife professionals, and researchers).
- People who are taking long trips or moving to Lebanon
- Children, because they tend to play with animals, might not report bites, and are more likely to have animal bites on their head and neck. - Mod.CRD
