Bulgaria's agriculture minister fears Romania's bird flu
--------------------------------------------------------
Now that Bulgaria has calmed down because the bird flu found in the south
has been tamed, the country should worry about pressure from its northern
neighbor Romania, agriculture minister Nihat Kabil said.
Romania's bird flu hotbeds may present a problem for Bulgaria in the fall,
as they are of the deadly-to-humans H5N1 strain, Kabil said for private
Darik radio on Saturday [29 Jul 2006].
The bird flu found in Bulgaria is not of the strain that may kill humans,
but the danger is far from gone, Kabil explained, as once the migration
period starts, Romania's outspread may become a threat.
Kabil also said that the preemptive halt of poultry exports was good for
Bulgaria, as this would allow the country to resume exports on its own
terms, since it beat the EU to placing the embargo.

[It would be helpful if the full data on the causative agent of the recent
Bulgarian outbreak (an LPAI H5 virus?) becomes available. The public
interest would be served if results of investigations from reference labs
were made available in a timely manner; see commentary to the following
item. - Mod.AS]

Thailand is offering help to Laos in stamping out bird flu, a Thai official
said on Monday [31 Jul 2006].
A delegation is due to arrive in the Lao capital Vientiane on Thursday [3
Aug 2006] to discuss cooperation in fighting bird flu outbreaks, which led
to the culling of hundreds of thousands of chickens in Thailand and Laos
last week, livestock development chief Yukol Limlaemthong said. "We are at
high risk," Yukol told Reuters after the slaughter of 310 000 hens in an
egg-producing village in the north eastern Thai province of Nakhon Panom,
which Thai officials say probably became infected via contaminated egg
trays from Laos.
Thai officials said on Sunday [30 Jul 2006] that 78 farms in Nakhon Panom
had been hit by the virus shortly after the UN Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO) confirmed an outbreak in a suburb of Vientiane, the Lao
capital.
The Vientiane outbreak is the only known case in Laos, while Nakhon Panom
is 300 km (200 miles) to the south east. Lao Foreign Ministry spokesman
Yong Chanhthalansy said there had been no reports of outbreaks across the
border from Nakhon Panom.
The farm in Vientiane, where about 2500 chickens died earlier this month
[July 2006], according to Lao state media, also had an outbreak in early
2004, when the virus swept through parts of Asia, including Laos, where
most of the 5.6 million people live in remote, rural areas.
FAO bird flu expert Laurence Gleeson said he was trying to find out whether
the Thai and Lao outbreaks were related. "We do not know whether the
recurrence of avian influenza in some parts of the poultry in the 2
countries is a result of low-grade circulation of the virus in backyard
farms or a reintroduction from outside," Gleeson said. "A lesson learnt
from the outbreaks in the 2 countries is that the animal health
surveillance system needs to be reviewed," said Gleeson, who is due to
arrive [in] Vientiane on Tuesday [1 Aug 2006].
Thailand has tried to step up its defenses against bird flu following the
return of the virus after an 8 month lull and the death of a 17 year old
youth in the northern province of Phichit. Adopting an extra cautious
stance, health officials have placed more than 800 people involved in
culling in Nakhon Panom or in hospitals in the area on a bird flu watch-list.
The Agriculture Ministry also banned imports of poultry and equipment from
neighboring countries, with violators facing a maximum penalty of 2 years
in jail and/or a 40 000 baht [USD 1000] fine.

[The evolving epidemiology of avian influenza in the Balkans and in South
East Asia, including the possible interrelations between neighboring
countries (Bulgaria/Romania and Thailand/Laos are just recent examples)
could be lucidly investigated if samples are dispatched in an urgent manner
to the reference laboratory. These 4 countries, for their part, are
expected to publish the outcome of their investigations, including sequence
results and -- if possible -- the resulting dendograms.
The recent establishment of OFFLU -- the Joint OIE/FAO worldwide scientific
network for the control of avian influenza -- is a welcome contribution to
transparency as related to avian influenza. OFFLU's website, which is under
construction, already provides the data of sequenced HA genes from 21 H5N1
isolates, as updated on 5 Aug 2006; see <http://www.offlu.net/>.
It is to hoped that all reference laboratories will provide their data
expeditiously to this useful website. - Mod.AS]
