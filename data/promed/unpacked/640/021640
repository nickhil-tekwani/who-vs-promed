Health officials in Georgia confirm a horse in Colquitt county has tested positive for eastern equine encephalitis [EEE]. "EEE is a viral disease that affects the central nervous system and is transmitted by the bite of infected mosquitoes," said Colquitt County Environmental Health county manager Lawanda Lovett.

According to the Georgia Department of Public Health, symptoms in horses include fever, depression, lack of appetite, facial paralysis, tongue weakness, difficulty swallowing, behavioral changes, gait abnormalities, or severe central nervous system problems, such as head-pressing, circling, blindness, and seizures. Officials say death can occur within 2 to 3 days even with intensive care.

A vaccine to protect against EEE is available for horses, but not for humans. "Horses that have been vaccinated in past years will need an annual booster shot," Lovett advised. "In areas with a long mosquito season, veterinarians might recommend 2 boosters per year -- one in the spring and one in the fall."

[Horse owners should vaccinate their horses and use equine-approved fly and mosquito spray. Home owners as well as horse owners should remove mosquito breeding locations of standing water in such places as old tires, and even the catch pans of potted plants. Some counties do widespread spraying.

This disease can affect humans and birds. It is a serious disease and should be taken seriously by horse owners for their animals and themselves. - Mod.TG
