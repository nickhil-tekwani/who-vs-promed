A cholera case was confirmed on 7th January 1998. The patient was a
50-year-old woman living in Kwai Tsing district. She had a history of
travelling outside Hong Kong from 28th to 29th December 1997. Upon return
to Hong Kong, she developed profuse painless watery diarrhoea on 30th
December 1997. She was seen at the Princess Margaret Hospital on 2nd
January 1998 and a stool sample was collected. She was subsequently
admitted into the same hospital on 5th January 1998 for treatment and
isolation when the initial laboratory finding suggested cholera. The
diagnosis was confirmed on 7th January 1998 and the patient is now in good
condition.
The organism isolated was _Vibrio cholerae_ O1, El Tor, Ogawa. It was
sensitive to ofloxacin but resistant to tetracycline, chloramphenicol and
septrin.
Investigation was carried out and control measures were implemented. The
patient's home was disinfected. Stool cultures from the travel companions
and family contacts were collected. The local food premises visited by the
patient during the incubation period were also investigated. None of the
contacts or food collaterals reported any gastrointestinal symptoms. There
is no evidence of secondary spread.
This is the first cholera case reported in 1998.

[Can it be assumed that this case was imported from outside China, since a
case contracted on the mainland would not be classed as imported? It would
be a service to international public health if countries would disclose the
origin of their imported cases - Mod.JW
