An outbreak of equine herpesvirus 1 (EHV-1), a contagious virus potentially fatal to horses, has already infected at least 10 horses in Minnesota, Iowa, and Wisconsin, killing 3 according to Anoka Equine Veterinary Services [Minnesota].

Infected horses have been documented in Chisago, Dakota, Hennepin, Freeborn, and Wright counties in Minnesota; Polk and St Croix counties in Wisconsin; with the last confirmed case on 8 Apr 2014.

According to Anoka Equine Veterinary Services, EHV-1 can cause 4 clinical presentations: neurological disease, respiratory disease, neonatal death, and abortion. The virus is spread by direct horse-to-horse contact but can also spread indirectly through tack, grooming equipment, or feed and water buckets. Although the virus is not harmful to humans, it can spread to horses by people's hands or clothing.

Vet offices are recommending limiting horses' potential exposure to the virus by avoiding situations where horses gather such as horse shows, trail rides, or clinics. Horse owners are also being advised to limit sharing tack or grooming equipment or at least taking steps to sterilize the equipment first.

The University of Minnesota Equine Center recommends keeping horses home for at least 2 weeks following the most recent confirmed case of EHV-1.

In order to minimize spread of the virus, the very popular Minnesota Horse Expo 25-27 Apr 2014 at the Minnesota State Fairgrounds issued a letter 9 Apr 2014 declaring it is limiting the horses allowed at the expo to PRCA [Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association] rodeo stock, Ma'Ceo show horses, clinician presentation horses, and pony and wagon ride horses. Breed and registry groups, private farms, and stables are not allowed to bring horses but may set up informational displays in the Horse Barn.

[This disease can spread fairly fast. It is often recommended to take the animal's temperature at least twice a day to help catch an early rise, which may be the 1st sign of the disease. If there is a rise in resting temperature (1st thing in the morning, before the animals have begun to move around much), then it is advisable to contact your veterinarian immediately.

This disease is often abbreviated as EHV for equine herpesvirus or EHM for equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy.

Equine herpesvirus (EHV-1) infection in horses can cause respiratory and neurological disease, abortion in mares, and neonatal foal death. The neurological form of the disease is known as equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy (EHM) and has the potential to cause high morbidity and mortality.

EHV-1 is easily spread and typically has an incubation period between 2 and 10 days. Respiratory shedding of the virus generally occurs for 7-10 days but may persist longer in infected horses. For this reason, the isolation period recommendation for confirmed positive EHM cases is 21 days. Clinical signs of EHM in horses may include nasal discharge, incoordination, hindquarter weakness, recumbency, lethargy, urine dribbling, and diminished tail tone. The prognosis for EHM positive horses depends on the severity of signs and the period of recumbency. Employing supportive treatment with intravenous fluids, anti-inflammatory drugs, antiviral drugs, and other supportive measures may be beneficial, since there is no specific treatment for EHM.

Currently, no EHV-1 equine vaccine has a label claim for protection against the neurological strain of the virus.

This is a disease that has a profound effect on horses and owners. Horses have a very tough time recovering from this disease, and owners have a difficult time treating or euthanizing their pets/companions.

This disease is not to be toyed with. Owners should heed the words of the veterinarians. Enforce the rest and isolation of your horse. Protect your horse and other horses as well.
