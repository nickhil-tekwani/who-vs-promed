The virulent Asian strain of citrus canker may be infesting trees in a
commercial grove in Collier County in South Florida, agriculture officials
said Tuesday. Lab results are still pending from the grapefruit samples
taken at the [name removed] grove in Immokalee. Canker is a bacterial
disease that is not harmful to people but can ruin fruit and weaken trees.
