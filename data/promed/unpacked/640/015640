NHS [National Health Service] staff are investigating 2 suspected cases of wound botulism in injecting drug users. It has been confirmed that 1 case has been identified in NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde and 1 in NHS Lanarkshire. Both individuals are receiving hospital treatment. The reported onset of symptoms was in early October 2015.

The cause of the infections is being investigated with the focus on injecting heroin users. The development comes 4 months after Police Scotland confirmed 44 people in Scotland were admitted to hospitals in the 6 months from December 2014 with illnesses where botulism was suspected. It was understood 10 of those people died.

In a circular Duncan Hill, specialist pharmacist in substance abuse for NHS Lanarkshire has said the source of the infection is "currently unknown" but warned that previous investigations have linked cases to batches of illicit contaminated heroin. "As such there is a potential for more cases to arise," he warned.

In June 2015 it emerged more than 2000 packs of foil had been handed out to Glasgow heroin users in a bid to stop them injecting the drug.

Foil was given out by healthcare workers to cut down the risks connected to injecting, following a botulism outbreak in the city. Users can use the foil to heat up and inhale the class-A substance instead of injecting with a needle. Around 300 addiction staff were trained up as part of the project to encourage drug users to try foil. The pilot started in September 2014 but was stepped up following the cases of heroin being contaminated with the botulism toxin.

Mr Hill warned: "Due to the complex nature of heroin distribution across Scotland, there is a potential for cases of wound botulism to arise locally." He asked all relevant health practitioners to increase awareness in hospitals and other healthcare settings to support prompt diagnosis and treatment as well as reporting possible or probable cases to the NHS.

He called for increased awareness among heroin users, their social networks, and drug treatment and harm reduction services regarding the signs and symptoms of wound botulism infection and of the importance of seeking medical treatment immediately. He said heroin users should be encouraged to reduce or eliminate use by promoting access to appropriately-dosed opiate substitution treatment.

Mr Hill added: "The potential risk will depend on the stage of contamination. If heroin contamination occurred early in the stage of distribution, it cannot be excluded that additional wound botulism-infected heroin injectors will be identified. "Wound botulism is a rare and very serious bacterial infection that is acquired when spores of the botulism bacterium get into the body. The spores can be found in soil but may also be present in contaminated supplies of street drugs such as heroin. Drug users may become infected through injecting the contaminated drugs into the skin and muscles."

[The following is a discussion regarding black tar heroin, which, because of being injected intramuscularly, can subject the injected drug user to a number of infections, including botulism, tetanus, and necrotizing fasciitis (http://www.drugaddictiontreatment.com/types-of-addiction/heroin-types-of-addiction/comparing-heroin-and-black-tar/):

Black tar heroin is a type of illegal narcotic derived from morphine. Commonly called black tar heroin, heroin content is not actually what distinguishes this particular drug from other kinds of opiates. While black tar does contain an amount of heroin that can range from 29 to 80 percent, the drug is actually identified by the amount of comparatively crude derivatives of morphine that result from incomplete acetylation. Without delving into the chemistry too exhaustively, black tar is an unrefined product that is made without the complex equipment and chemicals necessary to produce heroin with a high level of purity. Black tar is manufactured primarily in Mexico, and is also commonly referred to as black, brown, manteca, night, or dark. It is also produced in smaller quantities in other parts of Latin America.

Black tar use has spread throughout North America and can also be found in parts of Europe. Since the drug does not require the advanced equipment necessary to make pure heroin in white powder form, it is relatively cheap to manufacture and therefore cheap to purchase. It is less expensive to buy than white powder heroin, and it is much less expensive than commonly abused prescription opiates such as Vicodin or OxyContin.

Black tar is distinct in appearance from white powder heroin. It ranges in color from black to light brown, and it is sold either as a cola-like chunk, a coarse powder, or a sticky substance with the consistency of melted tar, hence the name. Black tar can be injected in its tar-like form, snorted in its powder form, or smoked. The effects of black tar are similar to the effects of other kinds of opiates, and include feelings of euphoria, relaxation, loss of anxiety, and anesthesia. Side effects can include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, and dry mouth.

The most common method of using black tar is injection, and this method poses risks apart from the dangers of the drug itself. For one, black tar users frequently suffer from venous sclerosis, a condition in which the veins shrink and harden. It may become impossible for users to inject intravenously if they develop venous sclerosis, forcing them to resort to subcutaneous injection. However, this method includes its own risks, such as cellulitis and necrotizing fasciitis. When black tar users inject repeatedly, they put themselves at risk for contracting wound botulism due to the impurities and adulterants present in the drug. The sticky consistency of the drug may also put users at greater risk of HIV if they are washing needles and reusing them.

The cheapness of black tar has helped to make it comparatively popular among young users who are inexperienced with drug use. Complications from drug use are more common when users are inexperienced. In addition, the impurities present in black tar, as well as the inconsistent ratio of heroin present in the drug, make overdose or death from complications due to the adulterants much more likely. Like all derivatives of morphine, black tar is extremely addictive. Dependency can occur after very few uses, and tolerance can also increase rapidly, causing users to experience irresistible cravings for increasingly large amounts of the drug. - Mod.LL
