More than 1000 people have fallen ill after taking part in a Mud Day race in southern France. Thousands of people turned up for the festivities in Nice on the Cote d'Azur, with around 8000 taking part in an obstacle course that ended with many of them almost completely submerged in mud. The next day, at least 30 participants complained of rapid-onset diarrhoea, vomiting and fever. That figure has now shot up to 1000.

Mud isn't naturally filled with loads of harmful bacteria (although it goes without saying it isn't particularly clean), leading some of the runners to suspect that the mud was laced with a toxic substance. Other participants recalled smelling horse manure at various points in the race.

The organisers have promised to 'make every effort' to find the cause of the stomach upsets, but we think it's safe to say fewer people will be running next year.

[A fuller description of the Cote d'Azur Mud Day in can be found at http://www.themudday.com/fr/presentation/concept. Analysis of similar outbreaks of gastrointestinal disease are common elsewhere. Mud Days are common, and it has been suggested that gastrointestinal disease associated with these events is due to norovirus infection.

For example: Illness following a Mud Day in Brooklyn in 2013 (Ess: CBS Health Detroit <www.cyclinmissy.com/2013/.../tough-mudders-bonus-obstacle-norovirus.html>) was attributed to norovirus infection.

Also in 2013, a similar event and outbreak took place in Michigan:
http://detroit.cbslocal.com/2013/07/05/200-sickened-by-norovirus-at-tough-mudder-event/
"State health officials said they've pinpointed what sickened more than 200 people following an event at the Michigan International Speedway. The Michigan Department of Community Health said they received call after call from spectators and participants of the 'Tough Mudder' competition -- which involves people running and crawling through mud, along with jumping over logs and other obstacles.

The callers, numbers more than 200, complained about "gastrointestinal symptoms, Officials said lab tests had confirmed that norovirus was the culprit. Health officials said there is no specific medication to treat norovirus. Sick people were urged to drink plenty of fluids to prevent dehydration and visit their doctor if they are concerned about their illness. Race attendees are asked to stay home for at least 48-72 hours after their symptoms subside in order to help stop the spread of the outbreak."

The short incubation period, accompanied by vomiting and diarrhoea, are characteristic of norovirus infection rather than a bacterial infection. It is likely that the 'gastrointestinal illness' frequently associated with any Mud Events is a consequence of norovirus infection, although noroviruses are not present in soil or water. - Mod.CP
