State veterinarian Robert Johnson confirmed yesterday that the bobcat that
attacked a dog and then tried to get into a West Rutland home at 3:30 a.m.
Sunday morning was rabid.
"I heard this awful noise coming from our German shepherd on the porch,"
said [a local woman]. "When I opened the door this big cat lunged, but I
slammed the door and caught its head and one paw." [Her husband managed to
kill the animal].
This left the family understandably shaken.
When the game warden came the next morning, he inspected the animal, which
appeared normal. It was only Sunday night, when scratches the wife had
gotten began to ache "like a terrible toothache," that they went to the
emergency room. The dead bobcat was then tested and found positive for
rabies which is spread through saliva and nervous system tissue. The family
will be treated for rabies today.
About half of the 803 rabies diagnosed rabies cases diagnosed in Vermont
between 1992 and 1999 occurred in raccoons. Skunks, foxes and bats account
for most of the other infections with a few cases each in dogs, cats,
cattle, bats and other mammals. The Rutland attack is the first documented
case in Vermont of an infected bobcat in recent memory. The wild felines,
which range throughout the state can weigh up to 40 pounds.
The dog, which suffered only scratches had been vaccinated and was given a
booster. "We bought him a great juicy steak and a kielbasa. My reward is
that my family is safe."
