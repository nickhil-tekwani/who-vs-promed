More than 500 people are currently [affected by an outbreak of measles],
which is 10 times the number recorded in previous years. About 75 per cent
of those infected are young people under the age of 35. The University and
the Medical College have been closed and additional beds are being made
available in hospitals. Funding is being sought for drugs [vaccine?].
Rooms at the Khmelnizkiy National University are empty due to imposition of
a quarantine. The disease has already affected almost 1500 students.
Measles can be a serious infection, affecting both mucous membranes of the
upper respiratory system, the eyes and can even result in inflammation of
the brain. The spread coefficient is 100 per cent.
Viktoriya Lenga of the Infectious Diseases Hospital commented that in 2005
only 5 measles cases were admitted to the hospital, whereas this year they
have had 150 patients. Patients are still being admitted; 10 new patients
at the weekend. Additional beds are being provided [for measles patients].
According to epidemiologists, the outbreak could have been avoided if
re-vaccination had been undertaken in time. Larisa Kliner, the chief of the
Epidemiological Department, commented that vaccination had been planned
with the assistance of WHO. But this had not happened and the outbreak had
occurred. Vaccine has now been purchased and a vaccine programme has been
initiated.
