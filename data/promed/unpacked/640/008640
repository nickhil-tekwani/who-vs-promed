Bird flu reaches Istanbul
---------------------------
Bird flu has been detected in dead chickens in Istanbul, confirming
the westward movement of the virus, which has already killed 3 people
in eastern Turkey, officials said on Sunday [8 Jan 2006].
Samples from chickens found dead in the district of Kucukcekmece, on
Istanbul's European side, tested positive for avian influenza, but it
was not yet clear whether it was the lethal H5N1 strain, agriculture
ministry spokesman Faruk Demirel said.
Istanbul is the westernmost point of Turkey in which the virus has
been detected since last month [December 2005], when it resurfaced in
remote regions, some 1500 km to the east.
The 1st outbreak, in a fowl farm in the northwest, was successfully
contained in October 2005.
The 3 deaths from the H5N1 strain in Turkey last week [1st week
January 2006] marked the 1st human fatalities from bird flu outside
Southeast Asia and China, where the disease has killed more than 70
people since 2003. 7 other Turks, all but one of them children, have
been confirmed as H5N1 carriers, including 3 cases in the capital
Ankara. Earlier on Sunday [8 Jan 2006], officials reported cases of
bird flu in 2 other western regions: Zonguldak and Yozgat. [See
commentary further; an administrative map of Turkey available at
<http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/middle_east_and_asia/turkey_admin83.jpg>].
The agriculture ministry said bird flu among winged animals had now
been confirmed in 10 of Turkey's 81 provinces.

Turkey not to blame for bird flu spread - FAO
-----------------------------------------------
There is no evidence so far that Turkey might have helped the spread
of bird flu by not reacting swiftly enough when the virus was 1st
identified in the country last October 2005, an international expert
said on Monday [9 Jan 2006].
Juan Lubroth of the U.N.'s Food and Agriculture Organization [FAO]
said the virus that recently caused a deadly outbreak in eastern
Turkey was slightly different, from a genetic point of view, from the
one detected among birds in the northwest 3 months ago, indicating
that Turkish authorities were not to blame. [Details on the genetic
differences between the current and previous Turkish H5N1 strains,
and the possible implications of observed viral changes upon
diagnosis and control, will be helpful. - Mod.AS]
"I recognize that this could be in people's minds (that the initial
response was inadequate), but there is no evidence of that so far,"
said Lubroth, who heads the infectious disease group at FAO's Animal
Health Service.
"The virus found in eastern Turkey is different from the one that
occurred in the west (in October 2005). It is more like the one found
in central China and Ukraine. So was the way in which the virus was
controlled the 1st time around inadequate? I don't think so," he said.
Turkey's Health Minister, Recep Akdag, said on Monday [9 Jan 2006] a
total of 14 people across the country have tested positive for bird
flu, including 3 children already dead.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has so far confirmed 4 cases in
Turkey, including 2 of the deaths. The WHO said other cases had not
so far been verified by laboratory tests.

killed. 3 were hospitalized at the Hospital of Sivas Cumhuriyet
University as a precaution against
possible bird flu stroke.
Sanliurfa: A 13 [year old], transferred from Siverek to Diyarbakir
and hospitalized at the Hospital of Dicle University, remains in
critical condition and is receiving intensive care.
Siirt: 5 children from the [same] family were hospitalized at
the Research Hospital of Dicle University on suspicion of bird flu
infection. The family, residents of the Celikli Village of the
Baykan District, lost their
chickens 4 days ago.

Erzurum on suspicion of the bird flu infection. The number of animals
killed increased to 27 843.
