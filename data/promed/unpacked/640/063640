Indiana authorities are about to fence out Michigan cattle, in a desperate
attempt to ward off a tuberculosis outbreak. State livestock authorities
and wildlife biologists admit they're powerless, however, to embargo [free
ranging whitetail deer in Michigan that are spreading the respiratory
disease among other animals.
The deer could migrate to Indiana and start an uncontainable outbreak. "If
we ever did get it, how are you going to get rid of it?" said Jim Mitchell,
a deer management biologist in the Indiana Division of Fish and Wildlife.
The Indiana State Board of Animal Health, for the first time in over a
decade, will vote Thursday whether to impose severe restrictions on
out-of-state livestock.
It likely will require cattle and several other species coming from
Michigan originate from herds where every animal has been tested for
tuberculosis within a year. Animals must be tested within 60 days of
entering Indiana. Those animals must be tested again 90 to 120 days after
entry.
While the bovine tuberculosis bacteria can be contracted by humans and any
other warm-blooded creature, it likely won't affect people, Denise Derrer
said. People would need to inhale mucous coughed or sneezed from an
infected animal. Pasteurization kills the bacteria in milk.
However, the stakes are enormous for Indiana's one-million cattle -- valued
at nearly $600 million last year -- and its overall livestock industry.
Indiana has enjoyed its tuberculosis-free status for nearly 20 years. An
outbreak would end that standing and almost certainly result in other
states slapping their own restrictions on Indiana livestock.
Michigan cattle producers will sell their cattle in Michigan instead of
trucking them to his Shipshewana Auction and enduring the cost and hassle
of testing.
In spite of the expected losses, Keith Lambright a sale barn operator in
Shipshewana said the board is doing the right thing by acting now.
Nevertheless, Lambright predicted, a few scofflaws will ignore the board's
emergency rule.
Michigan's problem was highlighted in the mid-90s, when deer bagged by
hunters began showing lesions characteristic of the disease on the lungs
and inside the rib cage.
Last year, alone, Michigan recorded 58 cases. Tuberculosis has moved into
several cattle herds in the northeastern section of the lower peninsula.
Experts think the disease is spreading through sneezing and other exchanges
of mucous when deer congregate around piles of feed set out legally by
hunters and wildlife watchers during Michigan's harsh winters.
The state has limited hunters' baiting the deer, and banned other feeding.
Michigan has lengthened hunting seasons to thin herds. Yet, tuberculosis
incidents are spreading to other parts of Michigan.
Michigan has a harsh option which Indiana couldn't replicate. Michigan
could ban all feeding and let the winters starve out diseased animals.
Indiana winters aren't that cold or snowy, Mitchell said.
He and other observers say they're most worried about the possibility of
deer farmers importing infected animals. Michigan deer are prized for their
large antlers, and deer farmers who raise game animals for preserves might
be tempted to buy Michigan deer, said Paula Yeager, executive director of
the Indiana Wildlife Federation, a conservation group.
Deer might not be the only wildlife capable of spreading tuberculosis.
Evidence suggests coyotes and other carnivores can be infected by eating
deer carcasses, Mitchell said.
Indiana authorities don't want to be caught flat-footed like their Michigan
counterparts. They plan to begin scouting for the disease during this fall.
Deer hunters will receive brochures asking them to report internal lesions.
