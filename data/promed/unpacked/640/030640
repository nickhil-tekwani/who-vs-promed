In mid-March 2015, an adult female eastern foxsnake (_Pantherophis gloydi_, formerly _Elaphe gloydi_) with signs of dermatitis was accidentally disturbed while hibernating at a location close to Lake Erie in Ontario, Canada. The snake was treated in captivity, and samples were submitted to the CWHC [Canadian Wildlife Health Cooperative] because the observed lesions were consistent with snake fungal disease.

The presence of the fungus _Ophidiomyces ophiodiicola_ was confirmed by culturing the fungus as well as by PCR [polymerase chain reaction]. Snake fungal disease was confirmed with histological examination of a full depth skin biopsy. We believe this is the 1st documented case of snake fungal disease in Canada. The disease has previously been confirmed in 16 US states.

Snake fungal disease (SFD) is an emerging disease affecting a variety of snake species in eastern North America, including the northern water snake (_Nerodia sipedon_), eastern racer (_Coluber constrictor_), rat snake (_Pantherophis obsoletus_ species complex), timber rattlesnake (_Crotalus horridus_), massasauga (_Sistrurus catenatus_), pygmy rattlesnake (_Sistrurus miliarius_), and milk snake (_Lampropeltis Triangulum_). First noted in 2006, the disease varies in severity but has been associated with significant morbidity and mortality in some cases. This is cause for concern in Ontario, where 10 of our 17 snake species, including the eastern foxsnake, are already provincially listed as species at risk.

Clinical signs of SFD can be severe and can include skin ulcers, invasion of deep muscle tissue and bone and, in rare cases, has been noted to invade the lungs and liver. However, the most consistent signs of the disease are scabs or crusty scales, subcutaneous nodules, abnormal molting, white opaque cloudiness of the eyes that is not associated with molting, or localized thickening or crusting of the skin. In many cases, affected snakes exhibit relatively mild signs similar to "hibernation sores".

Several agencies, researchers and organizations including the CWHC are working together to investigate the distribution and impact of this disease in Canada. We encourage conservation agencies, wildlife managers and members of the public to contact the CWHC if snakes with clinical signs consistent with SFD are encountered.

[Snake fungal disease (SFD) is an emerging disease of wild snakes in the eastern and midwestern USA, now also found in Canada. Recently, an experimental study reproduced the skin lesions observed in the field and confirmed that the etiologic agent is the fungus _Ophidiomyces ophiodiicola_. This fungus has been consistently associated with the often-fatal skin, face, and eye lesions characteristic of the disease. In recent years, cases of this fungal infection have been increasing.
