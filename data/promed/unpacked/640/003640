[As reported in EUFMD's most recent Global FMD situation report (July 2017), the WRLFMD at Pirbright has sequenced a field isolate received there from Mongolia (O/MOG/10/2017), genotyped as 'O/ME-SA/PanAsia'. The Mongolian virus was subjected to vaccine matching strain differentiation (VMSD) test, with the following results: "good matching results with O/TUR/5/2009 but not with O 3039 and Manisa". It will be interesting to note if the vaccine applied in Mongolia has been selected according to the said VMSD test results. The genotyping results above are not yet available on the WRLFMD website.

An OIE interactive map showing the locations of the 20 FMDV-O outbreaks reported from Mongolia since the start of the event (20 Jan 2017) is available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=22811.

According to Mongolia's National Broadcast, dated 30 Aug 2017 (machine-translated from https://www.mnb.mn/i/121355), FMD is also circulating in the eastern province (aimag) of Sukhbaatar, as well as the central province of Tuv (Tov), and in 2 districts (soums) (Songino Khairkhan and Khan-Uul) of the Mongolian capital of Ulaanbaatar. This presents a spread of the virus westwards, not yet reported to the OIE (map at http://www.ezilon.com/maps/images/asia/political-map-of-Mongolia.gif).

The media report also includes the following data on vaccination: "The vaccination program was implemented from 11 Aug 2017 in 934 427 livestock . Currently, vaccinations of 750 363 heads of livestock in 6 districts are being implemented, of which 83.7 percent have already been completed." It is not clear if the said vaccinations cover also the recently infected central regions. - Mod.AS
