Vancomycin-resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_ -- New York, 2004
--------------------------------------------------------------
_Staphylococcus aureus_ is a common cause of hospital and community
acquired infections (1,2). The development of vancomycin-resistant
enterococci in 1988 led the way to the emergence of vancomycin-resistant
_S. aureus_ (VRSA) (minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC] >32 microg/mL
[3]), first recognized in 2002
(<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5126a1.htm> 4-7). This report
describes the 3rd documented clinical isolate of VRSA from a patient in the
United States and provides evidence of failure to detect this VRSA by
commonly used automated antimicrobial susceptibility testing.
On 17 Mar 2004, a urine culture obtained from a resident of a long term
care facility yielded _S. aureus_. The isolate was tested for antimicrobial
susceptibility by using Microscan overnight panels (Dade Behring,
Deerfield, Illinois); vancomycin MIC was 4 microgram (mcg)/mL. Further
testing by Etest (AB Biodisk North America, Inc, Piscataway, New Jersey)
indicated that the isolate was resistant to vancomycin (MIC greater than
256 mcg/mL). After notification and subsequent analysis by the New York
State Department of Health (NYSDOH), the isolate was forwarded to the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), where it was confirmed to
be VRSA (vancomycin MIC = 64 mcg/mL, using the National Committee for
Clinical Laboratory Standards broth microdilution reference method). The
isolate contained both the mecA and vanA genes mediating oxacillin and
vancomycin resistance, respectively. The isolate was susceptible to
chloramphenicol, linezolid, minocycline, quinupristin-dalfopristin,
rifampin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.
The patient remains in a long term care facility, and NYSDOH is
investigating the case. The goals of the investigation include assessment
of infection control practices and whether transmission to other patients,
health care providers, family, and other contacts has occurred. Previous
investigations of VRSA demonstrated no transmission among contacts
(<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5140a3.htm> 5,6). This VRSA
isolate appears to be unrelated epidemiologically to the VRSA isolate
identified previously in Michigan and Pennsylvania
(<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5140a3.htm> 5,6).
Although the New York isolate contained the vanA resistance gene, the
vancomycin MIC of the isolate appeared low when tested initially by an
automated method. Additional testing at CDC indicated that Microscan and
Vitek (bioMerieux, Hazelwood, Missouri) testing panels and cards available
in the US did not detect vancomycin resistance in this VRSA isolate.
Consequently, additional VRSA infections might have occurred but were
undetected by laboratories using automated methods. Potential VRSA isolates
should be saved for confirmatory testing, and clinical microbiology
laboratories must ensure that they are using susceptibility testing methods
that will detect VRSA. The most accurate form of vancomycin susceptibility
testing for staphylococci is a nonautomated MIC method (for example, broth
microdilution, agar dilution, or agar-gradient diffusion) in which the
organisms are incubated for a full 24 hours before reading results.
Therefore, when performing automated susceptibility testing of _S. aureus_
strains, particularly methicillin resistant _S. aureus_, laboratories
should include a vancomycin-agar screening plate containing 6 microg/mL of
vancomycin and examine the plate for growth after 24 hour incubation.
The public health response to identification of this VRSA infection is
ongoing. Use of proper infection control practices and appropriate
antimicrobial agent management can help limit the emergence and spread of
antimicrobial resistant microorganisms, including VRSA. CDC recommends
contact precautions when caring for patients with these infections,
including 1) placing the patient in a private room; 2) wearing gloves and a
gown during patient contact; 3) washing hands after contact with the
patient, infectious body tissues, or fluids; and 4) limiting the use of
patient-care items to individual patients. In addition, the number of
people caring for a patient with VRSA or vancomycin-intermediate _S.
aureus_ should be minimized (for example, by assigning dedicated staff to
care for the patient). Isolation of _S. aureus_ with confirmed or
presumptive vancomycin resistance should be reported immediately through
state and local health departments to the Division of Healthcare Quality
Promotion, National Center for Infectious Diseases, CDC, telephone
800-893-0485.

true resistance. The issues regarding detecting the resistance by the
