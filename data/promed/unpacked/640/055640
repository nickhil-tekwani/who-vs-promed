The department of health in the UK has identified another case of legionellosis related to the Calpe Hotel in an individual who stayed there from 3-24 Jan 2012.

The British health authorities were informed of this new case, and the Director General of Health has confirmed the "time-space relationship" with the outbreak [associated with the (AR Diamante Beach) Hotel in Calpe, Costa Blanca Spain] that has led to the deaths of 3 people who stayed at the hotel during those dates.

There have been 16 cases reported thus far. Those patients who are presently in the hospital are in "stable" condition according to the Health Department. Of the 16 affected individuals, 12 are British and 4 are Spaniards (3 workers at the center and one tourist), whose ages range from 44 to 88 years.

The health authorities are confident that the Diamante Beach Hotel in Calpe will be able to reopen later this week after a thorough cleaning.

For a discussion of legionellosis, see ProMED-mail post: Legionellosis - Spain (05): Madrid 20101115.4142. Dr Steve Berger has noted that rates of legionellosis have been increasing in Spain (http://www.gideononline.com/2010/06/12/legionellosis-in-spain/). It is not known whether this is due to increased reporting or an actual increase in acquisition of this infection.
