The Ministry of Health confirmed that the death this past 21 Sep
[2008] of a 17-year-old youth from the community of Villarreal in the
Nata district was due to acute pulmonary syndrome caused by a
hantavirus [infection].

Francisco Navarro, regional health director in Cocle province, said
that the results from the samples sent to the Gorgas Commemorative
Institute confirm that it was another case of hantavirus [infection].

So far in 2008, 6 cases of hantavirus infection have been recorded in
Cocle province, of which 3 youths of 13, 17, and 18 years have died,
causing the authorities to call community [attention] to [the
implementation] of sanitary measures.

"The hantavirus came and it will not leave, so it is necessary to
take preventive measures so that more cases do not appear and [even
more] that they do not end up as fatalities," Navarro emphasized.

This physician indicated that the Cocle health region maintains
constant operations in all the areas and in [areas of] suspected
cases it provides community orientation. However, since the harvest
season is beginning and the dry season is [coming] next, preventive
programs will be intensified.

This year [2008], cases of hantavirus [infections] have been
registered in Nata, Ola, and Aguadulce districts, but since the
report of the 1st case in 2000, cases have occurred in the 6
districts of the province.

[This report does not indicate which hantaviruses were the
etiological agents involved in these cases, but are most likely
Choclo virus. Hantaviruses (and their rodent hosts) recognized in
Panama include Rio Segundo (_Reithrodontomys mexicanus_), Choclo
(_Oligoryzomys fulvescens (costaricensis)_), and Calabazo
(_Zygodontomys brevicauda (cherriei)_). Of these 3 viruses, only
Choclo is a known human pathogen, causing hantavirus pulmonary
syndrome. ProMED-mail thanks Dr James Mills for providing a current
list of worldwide hantaviruses and their reservoir hosts.
