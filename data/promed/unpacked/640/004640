--------------------------------------------------------------------------
The German NPPO has informed the EPPO Secretariat of the following:
_Clavibacter michiganensis_ subsp. _michiganensis_ (EPPO A2 quarantine
pest) (EU Annexes) [was] found in 1998 in Sachsen on tomatoes grown under
plastic (1 ha). All infected plants were destroyed.
The status of [the] pest in Germany can be described as:
Present: only in some areas.
Potato spindle tuber viroid (EPPO A2 quarantine pest) was found in 1998 in
Nordrhein Westfalen on transgenic potato material (4 breeding lines of
potato cv. Bintje) grown in an experimental field of a [plant] breeding
institute. The viroid was detected by visual observation of symptoms and
laboratory tests. [All] infected potato material was immediately destroyed
[and] the experimental field and surroundings were treated with an
herbicide. [No symptomatic plants were observed] within a radius of 5 km.
Surveys will continue to verify absence of the disease.
The status of potato spindle tuber viroid in Germany can be described as:
Present: only in one area and under eradication.
