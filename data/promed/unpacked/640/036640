The Clinton administration is supporting plans to expand a two-year-old
program for halting and tracking the worldwide spread of infectious diseases,
Vice President Gore said yesterday. [President Clinton will expand CDC's
mandate to explicitly include international health - Mod.JW].
The $26 million budget increase would greatly expand the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention's [National Center for Infectious Diseases - NCID],
which has been heading the project that began in 1994.
'Today, guaranteeing the nation's security means more than guarding our
borders,' Gore said in a speech to the National Council for International
Health. 'Guaranteeing the national security also means guarding our nation's
health.'
Under the CDC plan, [the NCID] budget would grow from $18.4 million
to $44.4 million to help create what Gore called a 'global surveillance
system.'
A key component would be a worldwide system of computer links with poor
countries lacking such technology, thus allowing medical researchers to work
together more closely. [USAID received $15 million last week to connect
health centers in 20 African countries to the Internet].
CDC asked for the infectious-diseases money in its budget for the fiscal year
beginning Oct. 1, 1996, and Gore's backing yesterday suggests the administration
intends to fight hard for the project.
The plan also would allow the CDC to expand from four to 10 its number of
regional infectious-disease centers [in the USA]. State and local health
systems would be able to begin sharing research and disease information by
computer.
[At least 18 states & Puerto Rico are already interacting through
ProMED-mail - Mod.JW]
The administration's proposal would vastly expand a network, created in 1994
and under evaluation since then, that warns of exotic new germs and watches
for the return and migration of old ones.
Other aspects of the initiative include:
- Allowing foreign researchers to use Defense Department laboratories abroad to
conduct tests and studies, as well as expanding existing research and
training programs within the National Institutes of Health.
- Expanding private-sector input by scientists and health-care companies
already working with the government to prevent the spread of disease.
- Tightening regulations for quarantine at U.S. ports of entry [presently
there are quarantine offices at only 7 US ports of entry - Mod.JW].
Gore said the need for the program is underscored by the fact that even when
AIDs-related deaths aren't counted, the US mortality rate from infectious
diseases climbed by 22 percent between 1980 and 1992.
