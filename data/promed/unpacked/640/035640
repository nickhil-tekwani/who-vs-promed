Bulgaria's food safety agency reported an outbreak of the virulent bird flu virus on Monday [29 Oct 2018] on 2 duck farms in southern Bulgaria.

All ducks in the farms in the village of Malevo and the village of Garvanovo will be culled to prevent the spread of the disease, which was confirmed by laboratory tests, the agency said in a statement, without specifying which strain of bird flu was involved [see comment].

Earlier this month [October 2018], veterinary authorities culled over 100 000 chickens and over 16 000 ducks after bird flu virus was detected on a poultry and a duck farm in southern Bulgaria.

[According to Bulgaria's recent notifications to the OIE (20181001.6064181, 20181009.6080595, 20181020.6101904), earlier outbreaks of avian influenza on poultry farms in the southern, neighboring districts Plovdiv and Khaskovo (Haskovo) were caused by HPAI H5N8. It is highly likely that the new outbreaks within the same districts, which are yet to be officially notified, have been caused by the same pathogen.
