The [Kedah] state Health Department has received a total of 70 reports on dog bites as of Wednesday [7 Oct 2015], an increase of 22 cases from the week before. According to state health director Datuk Dr Norhizan Ismail, Kuala Muda recorded the highest number of dog bite cases with 21. This was followed by Kulim with 18, Kubang Pasu at 10, Kota Star with 7, Bandar Baharu and Langkawi with 4 each, 3 in Baling, and 1 each in Yan and Padang Terap.

In his statement, he said from the total number, only a husband and wife couple in Kota Star were placed under observation, as their dog was confirmed to have rabies. "The Kota Star district health office will monitor the health of this couple, who have been advised to seek immediate treatment if they experience fever, headaches, and muscle fatigue," he said. It was earlier reported that there was an outbreak of the zoonotic virus in Perlis, Kedah and Penang. Measures had been stepped up to ensure that the public is safe from the disease.

[It is hard to make out the timeline in this report, and the scale of the dog biting; the simplest explanation is that it is the October (2015) total as of the 7th. But it does shine a light on the problem "What bites do you pay attention to?", noting that dogs have a natural tendency to bite, especially when on alert. And at the community level, awareness of an individual dog's habits may be slim. Which brings home the importance of having all dogs vaccinated against rabies when canine rabies is a known and recognised problem.

These bite reports are for the state of Kedah in NE Malaysia, on the Thai border; see http://www.fallingrain.com/world/MY/02/Kota.html. Kota Setar is a district in Kedah, Malaysia where the state capital Alor Star is situated. - Mod.MHJ
