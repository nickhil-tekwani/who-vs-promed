A 10-year-old boy died in the Asht central district hospital on 31 Mar 2014 of botulism poisoning. The boy was one of 33 residents of the Qahramon village in Sughd [Sogd]'s Asht district who have contracted botulism poisoning by eating home-canned tomatoes.

According to the Sughd Center for Sanitary and Epidemiological Supervision, 4 of them were in the intensive care unit. "On 21 Mar 2014, some 95 residents of the village of Qahramon gathered to celebrate the Navrouz holiday, and 33 of them contracted botulism poisoning by eating home-canned tomatoes," said the source. "On 23 Mar 2014, they were taken to the Asht central district hospital, where they were treated for botulism."

Botulism is a rare and potentially fatal paralytic illness caused by a toxin produced by the bacterium _Clostridium botulinum_. The disease begins with weakness, trouble seeing, feeling tired, and trouble speaking. This may then be followed by weakness of the arms, chest muscles and legs. The disease does not usually affect consciousness or cause a fever.

Botulism can occur in a few different ways. The bacterial spores that cause it are common in both soil and water. They produce botulinum toxin when exposed to low oxygen levels and certain temperatures. Foodborne botulism happens when foods containing the toxin are eaten. Foodborne botulism results from contaminated food in which _C. botulinum_ spores have been allowed to germinate in low oxygen conditions. This typically occurs in home-canned food substances and fermented uncooked dishes. Given that multiple people often consume food from the same source, it is common for more than a single person to be affected simultaneously. Symptoms usually appear 12-36 hours after eating, but can also appear within 2 hours to 10 days.

[Tomatoes can be at the borderline of what is considered a low-acid food, which makes canning them somewhat hazardous for the risk of botulism. It is generally suggested to add a few drops of lemon juice prior to the canning procedure to lower the pH further. - Mod.LL
