Chile: Fewer Cases of Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome So Far in 2003
--------------------------------------------------
As of Fri 26 Sep 2003, 39 cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) have
been confirmed, a number lower than that recorded during the same period
both in 2002 and in 2001 (60 and 62 cases respectively). 11 deaths have
been recorded, representing a mortality rate of 29 percent. During 2003
thus far, cases of HPS have been registered in the metropolitan region (2),
and regions VII (4 cases), VIII (16 cases), IX (7 cases), X (9 cases), and
XI (1 case). The highest incidence of HPS has been recorded by the health
services of Nuble (2.2 x 100 000 inhabitants), Valdivia (1.7 x 100 000),
Aysen (1 x 100 000), and A. Sur (0.9 x 100 000). In addition, to date,
there has been one confirmed case of mild disease caused by hantavirus
infection in Nuble.
During 2002, 65 cases of HPS were confirmed, with the following
characteristics:
(1) 19 deaths due to HPS, a mortality rate of 29 percent, representing the
lowest rate recorded since the disease was first detected in the country.
(2) The number of cases of HPS registered between January and December
2002, was lower than that observed during the same period in 2001 (81 cases).
(3) Cases were distributed among regions V through XI as follows: V region
(2), Metropolitan region (2), VI region (4), VII region (10), VIII region
(14), IX region (9), X region (20), and XI region.
(4) The Health Services of Aysen (4.1 x 100 000 inhabitants), and Valdivia
(3.1 x 100 000) recorded the highest incidence rates in the country.
(5) In addition, 2 cases of mild disease caused by hantavirus infection
were recorded in Maule and Valdivia.
This disease will continue to be endemic in Chile, with seasonal outbreaks.
Although to date cases have only been registered in regions V through XI,
the virus reservoir is present in regions III through XI and, therefore,
cases might appear in all of them. Thus, the inhabitants of these regions
must adopt the necessary preventive measures to avoid contact with rodents,
in particular at the beginning of the spring.

[The likely causal agent is the hantavirus species _Andes virus_ (family
_Bunyaviridae_, genus _Hantavirus_), which is prevalent in Chile and whose
reservoir host is the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys
longicaudatus_), which is found in rural areas throughout most of the
country. The Chilean Ministry of Health Epidemiology web-site contains
tables giving the geographic and demographic characteristics of cases of
hantavirus pulmonary syndrome by year since reporting began in 1993. See:
<http://epi.minsal.cl/epi/html/bolets/reportes/Hantavirus/Hantavirus26dic2002.htm>.
