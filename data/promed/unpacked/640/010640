A major outbreak of equine infectious anemia on the Ute Indian Reservation
in Utah, where an unprecedented 14 percent of 200 wild horses gathered in a
roundup last month tested positive, has prompted the US Bureau of Land
Management and the Utah Department of Agriculture to announce the round-up of
about 500 additional horses in the state. (Rate of infection is higher in
the eastern part of the US.)
Horses testing negative will be immediately released; horses testing
positive will be euthanized. The disease, also known as swamp fever, is
incurable. Mortality can be as high as 30 percent, and infected animals
become permanent carriers of the insect vectored virus.

[I asked Tom McGinn to summarize his considerable experience with the EIA
and the wild horse populations on the Outer Banks of North Carolina, those
isolated ribbons of land on the very eastern edge of the state which snared
the famous Blackbeard's ship. The "structural factors" pushing the
emergence of disease has been well delineated for human populations
(demographics, travel, technology etc). I have yet to see a similar list
for animal populations but I suspect the relocation of wild horses, swine
and other populations may be candidate "structural factor" promoting the
emergence of disease in animal populations. - Mod.PC

North Carolina Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (NCDA&CS)
started testing wild horses on the Outer Banks Islands in 1988 when 32
horses were removed by boat from Carrot Island. These horses were removed
because overpopulation had resulted in starvation the prior winter. Prior
to adoption, 9 of the 32 horses removed tested positive to Equine
Infectious Anemia (EIA). The positive animals were euthanized and the
negatives were quarantined for 60 days post exposure and the released for
adoption.

In 1996 NCDA&CS assisted the National Park Service in testing 184 horses
on Shackleford Banks. The purpose of this test was to prepare horses for a
similar adoption effort to reduce the population of horses on the island.
76 positive were identified and euthanized. No adoptions occurred. The
horses left on the island were re tested a year later and 4 out of 100
tested positive.

On Cedar Island 12 of 14 total wild horses tested positive to EIA. The
positive were euthanized and the two negative horses were rounded up 60
days post exposure for a negative test. This is the only island of the
three that has road access and exposure to horses from the mainland.
