New York potato growers' victory over golden nematode
-----------------------------------------------------
Potato growers are declaring victory in a 60 year long battle with the golden nematode [GN]. In total 300 000 acres [120 000 ha] of land have been removed from regulation for the pest.

"Our farmers truly deserve all the credit as they adhered to rigid crop rotation schedules and conducted the necessary equipment sanitation," State Agricultural Commissioner Darrel Aubertine said. He announced that 262 118 acres [106 000 ha] in Livingston County, 43 520 acres [17 600 ha] in Genesee County, and 729 acres [295 ha] in Steuben County meet all requirements for removal from GN regulation.

The pest free status is according to a set of rules drawn up in 2009 jointly between the US and Canada. In accordance with these most of the currently regulated areas of New York State can now be reclassified over the next few years and removed from state and federal quarantine.

[Both golden (_Globodera rostochiensis_, with at least 5 races) and pale (_G. pallida_) potato cyst nematodes (PCNs) cause serious crop losses in potato. Other solanaceous crops (such as tomato) and weeds may serve as pathogen reservoirs. Symptoms on potato include stunting of plants, yellowing and wilting of leaves, as well as a reduced root system. PCNs may lead to complete crop failure. Diseased plants first occur in isolated patches and these become larger with each new crop.

The nematodes can survive in soil for up to 20 years as cysts. Spread occurs via infected soil, water, wind, or on plant material. Disease management includes exclusion, long crop rotation with non-host species, use of crop cultivars resistant to specific PCN races, and nematicides. These control measures can be combined to keep nematode levels below economic thresholds.

Eradication of PCNs from affected fields, as reported above, is difficult and rarely successful. Successful eradication of golden PCN has also been reported in 2010 from Western Australia after a 24-year programme (ProMED-mail post 20110321.0885).
