Central Darfur's minister of health, Issa Mohamed Moussa Yousif, announced on Tue 18 Dec 2012 the start of the 2nd stage of the yellow fever vaccination campaign in the localities of Bendessey and Mukjar.

He told Radio Dabanga that the vaccination campaign in the 2 localities will continue for about 12 days. The minister explained that the targeted number of people in the locality of Mukjar is about 69 000 and 67 000 in Bendessey. He appealed to all citizens to visit the vaccination centers in the 2 localities as soon as possible.

Furthermore, he revealed the emergence of 8 new cases of yellow fever in the state, explaining that 5 of the cases came from Jebel Amer and the other 3 from the locality of Zalingei. The minister noted that the number of infections in the state has reached 424, while no new cases were added to the death toll.

In South Darfur, the 2nd phase of the campaign has begun at Nyala Stadium, targeting more than one million citizens in the localities of Nyala, Bilail, Salam, Nitega, and the camps for displaced.

The state's minister of health, Ahmed Tayyeb, said in a press statement that the campaign will continue for a period of 12 days, in conjunction with the vaccination campaign against polio, for all children in the state. He stated that the vaccines for the 3rd phase are expected to arrive in Sudan next Sunday [23 Dec 2012] so as to vaccinate the entire population of the state.

For his part, the director of comprehensive vaccination in the state, Siddiq Abdullah Abbaker, noted that the campaign which began in Nyala is being implemented through 122 location centers, including schools, health centers, and temporary centers for citizens.

[The situation in Central Darfur is of concern with the appearance of new cases, especially in Jebal Amer, the area of gold mining with a fairly large, and probably transient population. It is now clear that the vaccination campaign will require a lengthy effort to achieve coverage adequate to stop the outbreak. The initiation of the 2nd phase with plans to begin a 3rd phase over extended geographic areas is encouraging. One hopes that an active surveillance effort will promptly detect new cases and will elicit a rapid response by vaccination teams.
