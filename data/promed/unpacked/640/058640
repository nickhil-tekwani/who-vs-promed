There are 10 positive cases of JE [Japanese encephalitis] in Churachandpur [distict], according to officials of the District Surveillance Office [DSO].

Dr Ngahneikim Haokip, DSO IDSP [Integrated Disease Surveillance Program], said 16 samples from the district were tested for JE, of which 10 were found positive. The DSO also maintained that there are no confirmed cases of swine flu or scrub typhus in the district.

The district health authorities have meanwhile activated a rapid action team to monitor and respond to JE and dengue cases in the district.

[It is not surprising that JE cases are occurring in Manipur state. It is adjacent to Assam state, where a JE outbreak with additional cases of acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) is occurring. In this Manipur report, however, no AES cases are mentioned. Since this is still the JE virus transmission season, it is likely that there will be more cases over the next 2 months. The report above does not mention that the JE vaccine is available, nor does it say if there have been recent JE vaccination campaigns in the affected areas, or if any are planned. - Mod.TY
