TYPHOID WARNING: WALES (GLAMORGAN)(02)
======================================
[see: Typhoid warning - Wales (Glamorgan) 970314152651]

There have been several articles in the press describing a case of typhoid
in a 16-year-old girl in Glamorgan, South Wales, with onset at the
beginning of March, 1997. Neither the girl, nor members of her family, had
traveled abroad recently; health officials are investigating the possible
role of local restaurants.
An article by O. Boycott in The Guardian newspaper (March 12, 1997) cited a
health official as saying "Because of the incubation period, we cannot rule
out that there will be more cases to come."
During 1996, 173 cases of typhoid were diagnosed in England and Wales, but
only 21 were thought to have involved infection in the country, and almost
all were traced to carriers who had recently arrived from abroad.
