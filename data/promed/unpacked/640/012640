Unseen anthrax cases
------------------------------
Thinking back to my days in clinical laboratories, monitoring blood
cultures, I think that contamination rates of 5 percent were not
uncommon. In some institutions, contamination rates have run as high
as 10 percent, which is not acceptable. I believe 3 percent is
generally considered achievable.
The majority of blood culture contaminants are _Staphylococcus_ sp.,
usually coagulase-negative (i.e., not _Staph. aureus_). _Bacillus_
spp. are probably the second most common contaminant. Most of these
would be _B. cereus_. Most often this would involve perhaps one blood
culture bottle out of 2 or 3 sets (a set would be 2 bottles: one
aerobic and one anaerobic). [I don't know how many are normally
collected these days. Â­ Mod.MHJ
My guess would be that _Bacillus_ spp. contamination rates in blood
cultures may range up to 1 percent. An acute care hospital of 100 beds
should expect to see one or more _Bacillus_-contaminated cultures a
month, while larger medical centers might see one or more a week.
In 20+ years of medical laboratory work, I don't think I ever saw a
non-hemolytic _Bacillus_ spp. on a blood culture (noting that
_Bacillus anthracis_ is typically hemolytic on sheep blood agar).
Given that hospital-based bacteriologists are used to seeing
_Bacillus_ species as contaminants, it would not be at all surprising
if a _Bacillus anthracis_ slipped through rarely. On the other hand, a
fulminant case might well yield multiple positive blood cultures,
positive CSF, etc., and heighten the index of suspicion, albeit most
often post-mortem.
There are a few facilities that I know that routinely screen
_Bacillus_ isolates from blood or other sterile body fluids for _B.
anthracis_. [In response to my question, no positives were ever
found, but denominator data were not available. - Mod.JW The typical
response in most facilities, though, has not been to identify
_Bacillus_ isolates. Rather, they are generally presumed to be
contaminants and discarded.
Incidentally, Dr. Nesemann's concern [see ref. at top about anthrax
being mistaken as diphtheroids is probably not warranted: diphtheroids
are much smaller and of irregular morphology than _Bacillus_ species
on Gram stain (_Listeria monocytogenes_ is also encountered in
clinical samples but is markedly more slender than _Bacillus_ on Gram
stain). Pneumococci are distinctive lancet-shaped diplococci.
A competent microscopist should readily be able to distinguish among
_Bacillus_, _Listeria_, diphtheroids, and pneumococci. Their colonial
morphologies on sheep-blood agar plates also differ.

[In reply to the above:
Although much of the background information is accurate, there has
been a major effort made over the course of the past 2 to 3 years to
get all clinical microbiology laboratories in the U.S. to come up to
speed on the identification of agents of bioterrorism. The statement:
"There are a few facilities that I know that routinely screen
_Bacillus_ isolates from blood or other sterile body fluids for _B.
anthracis_. The typical response in most facilities, though, has not
been to identify Bacillus isolates. Rather, they are generally
presumed to be contaminants and discarded"
was likely true several years ago, but is simply no longer the case.
There have been many regional and local meetings via the NLTN
(National Laboratory Training Network) in which these issues were
addressed and in which tables to identify agents of bioterrorism, the
publication last year of Cumitech 33, Laboratory safety, management,
and diagnosis of biological agents associated with bioterrorism by the
American Society for Microbiology Press (a series to which numerous
clinical microbiology laboratories subscribe) and, more recently, a
set of laboratory procedures for Level A labs (standard hospital,
clinic, and reference laboratories) that has been co-promoted by CDC,
ASM, and the American Public Health Association. These protocols can
be downloaded from the ASM web site as .pdf files at
<http://www.asmusa.org/pcsrc/biodetection.htm>
The protocol for identification of _B. anthracis_ has, essentially,
the requirement that laboratories look for beta-hemolysis (_B.
anthracis_ is non-hemolytic) and motility (_B. anthracis_ is
non-motile). Isolates of _Bacillus_ species that are non-hemolytic and
non-motile are to be transferred rapidly from the Level A laboratory
to a Level B laboratory within the Laboratory Response Network, in
which further testing (including definitive identification of the
isolate) is performed. Level A laboratories are not trained to
identify agents of bioterrorism definitively, but are trained to "rule
out" these agents. If these agents cannot be ruled out, the isolate is
referred to a Level B laboratory.
Though _B. anthracis_ is non-hemolytic and non-motile, there are other
_Bacillus_ species that also can have these properties. Of the
potential agents of bioterrorism, _B. anthracis_ is probably the
easiest to *not* miss by a Level A laboratory if the laboratory
follows the protocol. Since _Yersinia pestis_, _Francisella
tularensis_, and _Brucella_ species can be misidentified by
commercially available kits, these are more likely to be missed.
