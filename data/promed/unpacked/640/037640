The 1st anthrax case in Texas for 2014 has been confirmed in a goat in Kinney County. The premises is located 4 mi [6.5 km] north of Bracketville, Texas. The Texas Animal Health Commission (TAHC) has quarantined the premises. TAHC rules require proper disposal of affected carcasses and vaccination of other cattle on the premises prior to release of the quarantine.

Anthrax is a bacterial disease caused by _Bacillus anthracis_, which is a naturally occurring organism with worldwide distribution, including certain parts of Texas. It is not uncommon for anthrax to be diagnosed in livestock or wildlife in the southwestern part of the state. A vaccine is available for use in susceptible livestock in high risk areas.

Acute fever followed by rapid death with bleeding from body openings are common signs of anthrax in livestock. Carcasses may also appear bloated and appear to decompose quickly. Livestock or animals displaying symptoms consistent with anthrax should be reported to a private veterinary practitioner or a TAHC official. If affected livestock or carcasses must be handled, producers are encouraged to follow basic sanitation precautions such as wearing protective gloves, long sleeve shirts, and washing thoroughly afterward to prevent accidental spread of the bacteria to people.

"The TAHC will continue to closely monitor the situation for possible new cases across the state. Producers are encouraged to consult their veterinary practitioner or local TAHC office if they suspect their animals are affected with anthrax, or if they have questions about the disease or the vaccination of their livestock," said Dr TR Lansford, TAHC Assistant Executive Director for Animal Health Programs.

For more information regarding anthrax, contact your local TAHC region, call 1-800-550-8242, or visit http://www.tahc.texas.gov/agency/TAHC_RegionalOfficeMap_2013.pdf

The Texas Animal Health Commission works to protect the health of all Texas livestock, including: cattle, swine, poultry, sheep, goats, equine animals, and exotic livestock.

[I checked with the TAHC regional veterinarian Brodie Miller and the Bracketville veterinarian Zack Davis for background. This is a old ranch with 200 Boer goats and 70 Dahl sheep. A dead 3-year-old buck was found on Mon 23 Jun 2014, and taken by the goat herder to the veterinary clinic in Uvalde from which samples, presumably blood as anthrax was strongly suspected, were forwarded to the Texas A & M diagnostic laboratory in College Station, and anthrax confirmed. In the meanwhile they were strongly advised to get the flock and herd vaccinated, and to include a clostridial ('7-Way') vaccine as they had dropped behind in their vaccinations. When the goat herd was collected up for these 2 vaccines on Fri 27 Jun 2014, 3 more dead goats were found. The sheep were vaccinated sometime over the weekend. This ranch has suffered repeated outbreaks of anthrax in the past. They were strongly advised to burn the carcasses.

With the recent rains in the area, following a long extended drought, there would have been a forage flush which the goats, though normally browsers, would have grazed, putting themselves at risk. There is a suggestion that the salt blocks needed replacing in which case Zack has noticed that livestock will paw at the soil around where the block had been to get at any salt they can find. Another way to ingest anthrax spores in the soil. The help provided by Brodie & Zack is greatly appreciated.- Mod.MHJ
