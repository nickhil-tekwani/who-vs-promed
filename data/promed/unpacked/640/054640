Pests and diseases plague rice crops
------------------------------------
Pests and rice diseases have caused widespread damage to rice crops
in northern and central provinces. Changeable weather, including a
prolonged hot spell, had created favourable conditions, reported the
Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, and said that the
improper use of pesticides at the beginning of the crop had possibly
contributed to the situation.

Over 5200 ha [12 850 acres] of the rice crop in 19 northern
provinces, including Son La, Lao Cai, Dien Bien, Thai Binh, and Hai
Duong, had suffered from black stunt disease. In addition, the
summer-autumn crop had reportedly been hit by various pests.

Nghe An Agriculture and Rural Development Department said that local
farmers faced a high risk of crop loss because of drought and rice
diseases. Black streaked dwarf disease has also spread in 2300 ha
[5700 acres] over 11 districts.

At least 70 ha [173 acres] of paddy rice crop in northern Bac Giang
Province's Hiep Hoa District are suffering from an unidentified viral
disease that has made the rice leaves turn yellow and then red,
leaving the rice paddy withered. The district People's Committee said
that hundreds of hectares of paddy field was vulnerable to catching
the disease because of the high speed of contamination.

The locality witnessed the disease in the previous rice crop at the
same time in 2009 [when] it hit 600 ha [1483 acres] out of 8000 ha
[19 800 acres] of rice, reducing productivity by between 10-40
percent. Plant Protection Institute and Ha Noi Agriculture University
said laboratory tests found the disease was caused by a virus. More
exact findings would be released in the next 2 weeks.

Diseases raging through farmers' crops
--------------------------------------
Farmers around the country have struggled with diseases killing their
rice crops, while the Government assistance has been low and specific
remedies have not been found.

In Hiep Hoa District in the northern province of Bac Giang, a farmer
uncovered over 500 square meters [5380 sq ft] of her rice fields had
a strange disease that made the rice turn saffron and unable to grow
properly. The disease, which stunted rice even though she sprayed
chemicals and fertilized the fields, spread widely frightening
farmers. The district People's Committee said that the disease is in
other communes as well, affecting thousands of households.

Meanwhile, in an adjacent commune farmers have seen the return of
another disease, which causes green fields to turn dull red with
black stripes along the veins of leaves. Agricultural University in
Hanoi have investigated and said it is bacterial streak disease. The
owner of 2000 square meters [21 500 sq ft] of 2-month old sick rice
fields said that last year [2009] his fields also contracted the
disease, forcing him to burn the fields, as his buffalos refused to
eat the sick rice.

In Thai Binh Province, the rice stripe virus has also plagued fields
in Tien Hai District. The rice stripe virus disease has rapidly
spread in the province and become an epidemic in northern provinces,
sending farmers racing to buy pesticides to save their crops.
Department of Plant Protection said that the Government has yet to
find specific remedies.

[Black streaked dwarf and rice stripe viruses
---------------------------------------------
Black streaked dwarf disease of rice can be caused by _Rice black
streaked dwarf virus_ (RBSDV; genus _Fijivirus_), or the new, closely
related Southern rice black streaked dwarf virus reported from
northern Viet Nam and China. The viruses are spread by different
planthopper species. _Rice stripe virus_ (RSV; genus _Tenuivirus_) is
spreading in eastern Asia. An epidemic of its planthopper vector was
reported from northern Viet Nam in 2009 (ProMED-mail post
20090608.2118). Serious yield losses may be caused by these viruses
and their insect vectors. Disease management for rice viruses
includes cultural practices, vector control, and use of cultivars
with reduced sensitivity or resistance to the virus, the vector, or both.

Bacterial leaf streak
---------------------
Bacterial leaf streak of rice is caused by _Xanthomonas oryzae_ pv.
_oryzicola_ causes bacterial leaf streak of rice. It occurs in Asia
and West Africa and yield losses of up to 30 percent have been
recorded. Disease management includes phytosanitation (control of
weed and volunteer rice reservoir hosts, removal of contaminated
materials), cultural measures (optimal plant spacing and
fertilizers), and use of resistant crop varieties. Another strain of
the pathogen, _X. oryzae_ pv. _oryzae_, causes bacterial leaf blight,
which is also prevalent in the region.

Undiagnosed diseases
--------------------
The term 'black stunt' used above is not an official name of any rice
disease. A number of rice viruses can cause symptoms of
discolouration and stunting, but it is not clear which pathogen may
be referred to, or whether this is used as an alternative name for
black streaked dwarf.

The unidentified diseases in Hiep Hoa District described as viral in
item 1, and as "strange disease" in item 2, may refer to the same
problem. The symptom descriptions could apply to several viral but
also other pathogens, and a widespread undiagnosed disease was
reported from the area earlier in 2010 (ProMED-mail post
20100114.0162). In 2009, ragged stunt, rice stripe, and maize rough
dwarf viruses were reported from northern Viet Nam (ProMED-mail post
20090608.2118) and may have reappeared, but other diseases such as
bacterial leaf blight and fungal rice blast are also know to occur in
the region.
