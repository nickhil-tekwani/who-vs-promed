Fever, undiagnosed - USA (New Mexico) 981214124706

[This report has drawn a plethora of suggestions for the etiologic
agent, covering the gamut from arboviruses in search of a disease,
through leptospirosis -- 50% of the cases seen in Hawaii are reported
to have thrombocytopenia -- to "It's a hantavirus after all." Below
are a selection of responses - Mod.JW

The Infectious and Parasitic Disease knowledge base lists the
following diseases known to occur in the U.S.A. which have a perfect
match with thrombocytopenia and the clinical signs described:
Brucellosis
Endemic Relapsing Fever
Typhoid
Toxoplasmosis
Flea Borne Typhus
Ehrlichiosis
RMSF [Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever
Squirrel Borne Epidemic Typhus
Viral Hepatitis A
Cache Valley Fever
Lack of mention of any type of rash would seem to raise Brucellosis,
Ehrlichiosis and Cache Valley to a higher suspicion level than the
other diseases.
This list is based on the old DOS version. I will hand audit the
rewrites to be used in the Window's version and send an addendum if
one is necessary.

I ran this through GIDEON. Among several compatible diseases the
software lists:
Ehrlichiosis (both granulocytic and monocytic)
Colorado tick fever (known to occur in New Mexico)
Relapsing fever
Leptospirosis
Legionellosis (Pontiac fever)
Plague
Brucellosis
Dengue
Tularemia and
Q fever.

I agree that dengue could be suspect here. Recently, _Ae. aegypti_
has colonized parts of Arizona. Has any checked in New Mexico?

All the symptoms described in these cases are consistent with
ehrlichiosis and the timing is correct for a tick borne disease.
I've never heard of pain being such a prominent symptom in every
case, as described, but it certainly is a known symptom of
ehrlichiosis, along with abdominal pain, thrombocytopenia,
leukopenia, fever, chills, headache, etc.
I would be interested to know if they checked for ehrlichiosis or any
of the patients responded to doxycycline as treatment.

Although not specifically mentioned, did the investigators rule out
Colorado Tick Fever? Sounds a lot like it.
