----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Medical Microbiologists of Victoria (MMV) group of the Royal College of Pathologists Australasia (RCPA) has major issues with this misleading paper and subsequent commentary in MJA [Medical Journal of Australia] Insight and ProMED.

In order to claim a government rebate for pathology testing, Australian diagnostic microbiology labs must have National Association of Testing Laboratories Australia (NATA)/RCPA accreditation, comply with all relevant Australian testing guidelines and be enrolled in appropriate Quality Assurance Programs (QAPs). This requires confirming any positive _Neisseria gonorrhoeae_ NAAT result with culture or a 2nd nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) directed at a different genetic target.

The paper has used no direct clinical evidence, but has come to its conclusions by combining data from 3 separate reporting sources. MSHC [Melbourne Sexual Health Centre] did not have access to routine _Neisseria gonorrhoeae_ NAAT until after the study period and was not able to directly compare culture and PCR on a non-selected low risk female population. We believe that by using flawed methodology and without input from the laboratories performing the testing, they have made several false assumptions.

This is in the setting of a local gonorrhoea and syphilis epidemic in MSM [men who have sex with men] -- and we are also seeing increasing numbers of cases of locally-acquired syphilis in women. A full rebuttal is to follow.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Sarah Garner for her comments. We await a more detailed rebuttal from Dr Garner and colleagues of the article that recently appeared online in the Medical Journal of Australia: Chow EPF, Fehler G, Read TRH, et al: Gonorrhoea notifications and nucleic acid amplification testing in a very low-prevalence Australian female population. Med J Australia. 2015; 202(6): doi:10.5694/mja14.00780; available at https://www.mja.com.au/journal/2015/202/6/gonorrhoea-notifications-and-nucleic-acid-amplification-testing-very-low. - Mod.ML]
