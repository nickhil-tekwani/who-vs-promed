An observational Swedish study yesterday [6 Apr 2022] in BMJ reveals an elevated risk of serious blood clots and abnormal bleeding up to 6 months after recovery from COVID-19 (https://www.bmj.com/content/377/bmj-2021-069590).

A team led by Umea University researchers analyzed data from national registries in Sweden to follow 1 057 174 people diagnosed as having COVID-19 and 4 076 342 matched, uninfected controls from 1 Feb 2020 to 25 May 2021. They used a self-controlled case series (up to 6 months after diagnosis) and matched-cohort study design (first 30 days). Thirty-seven cases were likely reinfections. Average patient age was 40.2 years, and 51% were women.

In the case series, incidence rate ratios (IRRs) rose significantly 70 days after COVID-19 diagnosis for deep vein thrombosis (blood clot in a leg), after 110 days for pulmonary embolism (blood clot in a lung), and after 60 days for abnormal bleeding. Patients with mild cases also were at increased risk for clots but not bleeding.

In the 6 months after diagnosis, 1761 participants had a first deep vein thrombosis (DVT), 3267 had a first pulmonary embolism (PE), and 7927 had major bleeding for the first time. IRRs for a first DVT were 5.59 in the 1st week after diagnosis and 7.44 in the 2nd week, while IRRs for a first PE were 36.17 in the 1st week and 46.40 in the 2nd.

In the first 30 days, IRRs were 5.90 for DVT, 31.59 for PE, and 2.48 for bleeding. The absolute risk among COVID-19 patients in the 1st month after diagnosis was 0.04% (401 events) for DVT, 0.17% (1761 events) for PE, and 0.10% (1002 events) for bleeding.

Likewise, after adjustment for possible confounders, the matched cohort study showed that IRRs 1 to 30 days after COVID-19 diagnosis were 4.98 for DVT, 33.05 for PE, and 1.88 for bleeding. IRRs were highest for critically ill COVID-19 patients and those with underlying medical conditions during the 1st pandemic wave in Sweden, relative to the 2nd and 3rd waves. The researchers said the latter finding could be a result of improvements in treatment and vaccine coverage in older patients as the pandemic evolved.

The study authors said the results support the use of treatments to prevent blood clots in COVID-19 patients, particularly for high-risk patients, and they strongly encouraged vaccination. "These results could impact recommendations on diagnostic and prophylactic strategies against venous thromboembolism after COVID-19," they wrote. "It remains to be established whether SARS-CoV-2 infection increases the risk of venous thromboembolism or bleeding more than it does for respiratory infections, such as influenza, but also whether the period of thromboprophylaxis after COVID-19 should be extended."

In a related editorial, Frederick Ho, and Jill Pell, both of the University of Glasgow in Scotland, said that the study findings are still relevant, despite nearly 65% of the world's population having received at least one COVID-19 vaccine dose (https://www.bmj.com/content/377/bmj.o817). "Current vaccines are highly effective against severe COVID-19 but confer only moderate protection against infection with the omicron variant," they wrote. "Breakthrough infections are common, even after a 3rd dose, and effectiveness against symptomatic disease appears to decrease to less than 50% 10 weeks after vaccination."

Ho and Pell said that while many omicron infections are mild, the study shows that even unhospitalized patients with mild cases are at increased risk for blood clots. "Mild disease accounts for a much larger proportion of infections (94.5% in this study)," they wrote. "This patient group may therefore contribute a substantial number of thromboembolic events."

[2] COVID-19 news scan
[A] Fluvoxamine for COVID outpatients
Date: Thu 7 Apr 2022

A new systematic review and meta-analysis of 3 randomized clinical trials with 2196 patients suggests that early use of the antidepressant fluvoxamine reduces the risk of all-cause hospitalization in symptomatic adult outpatients. Fluvoxamine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor used to treat conditions such as obsessive compulsive disorder, also activates the sigma-1 receptor, which quells inflammation, the researchers noted.

McGill University researchers in Montreal led the study, which was published yesterday [6 Apr 2022] in JAMA Network Open (https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2790742). They extracted study data from the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov on 12 Nov 2021. All 3 clinical trials recruited unvaccinated COVID-19 outpatients with symptoms who had tested positive within 7 days of diagnosis but did not require supplemental oxygen.

The relative risk [RR] of a 50% chance of fluvoxamine effectiveness against hospitalization was 0.78, while it was 0.73 for an 85% chance of efficacy against hospital admission. A sensitivity analysis yielded an RR of 0.75.

Depending on the scenario, the odds of any link with reduced hospitalization after fluvoxamine treatment were 94.1%-98.6%, and the probability of a moderate association was 81.6%-91.8%.

Previous studies of fluvoxamine in COVID-19 patients have generated mixed results, and the Infectious Diseases Society of America recently recommended against its use in COVID-19 outpatients except in clinical trials. The study authors said, however, that widely available, safe, inexpensive options such as fluvoxamine, which costs about USD 1 a day, are needed for the prevention of COVID-19 hospitalization.

"Ongoing randomized trials are important to evaluate alternative doses, explore the effectiveness in vaccinated patients, and provide further refinement to these estimates," they wrote. "Meanwhile, fluvoxamine could be recommended as a management option, particularly in resource-limited settings or for individuals without access to SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibody therapy or direct antivirals."

[B] COVID-19 and pulse oximetry

Asking COVID-19 patients to use a pulse oximeter at home to measure oxygen levels was no better than asking if they experienced shortness of breath in determining outcomes, according to new research in the New England Journal of Medicine (https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2201541). The study was based on results seen in COVID Watch, a study from the University of Pennsylvania that sent text messages and monitoring prompts to patients with COVID-19 who were well enough to stay home to recover. The program launched in March 2020, with 28 500 patients using the program in the subsequent 2 years.

Previous studies showed that COVID Watch was linked with a 68% reduction in mortality. In this study, a randomized controlled trial was developed using 2000 patients who were assigned either a pulse oximeter or the standard care without home oxygen measurements.

There were no significant mortality outcomes with patients using the oximeter, even when the patient population was divided by age, race, and sex. The authors wrote there was no significant between-group difference in the number of days that patients were alive and out of the hospital at 30 days (mean, 29.4 days in the pulse oximetry group and 29.5 days in the standard program group).

Having a pulse oximeter also did not lessen patient anxiety, the authors of the study said. "Compared to remotely monitoring shortness of breath with simple automated check-ins, we showed that the addition of pulse oximetry did not save more lives or keep more people out of the hospital," said the study's co-lead author, Anna Morgan, medical director of the COVID Watch program, in a University of Pennsylvania press release (https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/948681).

[Also from the University of Pennsylvania press release: "'Overall, these findings suggest that a low-tech approach for remote monitoring systems based on symptoms is just as good as a more expensive one using additional devices. Automated text messaging is a great way for health systems to enable a small team of on-call nurses to manage large populations of patients with COVID-19,' said the research project's co-principal investigator, Krisda Chaiyachati, MD, an assistant professor of Internal Medicine and now the physician lead for Value-based Care and Innovation at Verily. 'There are a lot of other medical conditions where the same kind of approach might really help.'" - Mod.LK]

Over the last 7 days, 7292, 289, 1261, 103, and 794 COVID-19 cases were detected in India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nepal, and Sri Lanka, respectively, compared with 9403, 586, 1572, 145, and 1232 in the preceding 7 days, revealing a decreasing trend of the disease in all the 5 South Asian countries mentioned compared with the previous week.

The trends of daily confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths attributed to the disease in Pakistan can be seen at https://covid19.who.int/region/emro/country/pk.

In the last 7 days, the total number of people who died due to COVID-19 was 393 in India, 1 in Bangladesh, 2 in Pakistan, and 10 in Sri Lanka, but no one has died from the disease over the last 3 weeks or so in Nepal. Over the last 24 hours as of 8 Apr 2022 at 08:00 IST, COVID-19 deaths were reported from only 3 states of the 36 states and union territories in India -- Kerala (36), Maharashtra (6), and Uttar Pradesh (1) (https://www.mohfw.gov.in/).

As of 8 Apr 2022 at 08:00 IST (GMT+5:30), India has administered 1 853 888 663 doses of COVID-19 vaccine (https://www.mohfw.gov.in/).

Bangladesh has a plan for vaccinating 70% of the population. As of 6 Apr 2022, 107.50% have received the 1st dose and 96.24% of the target population have received the 1st and 2nd doses. Around 9.10% of the target population have also received a 3rd dose as a booster vaccination (http://103.247.238.92/webportal/pages/covid19-vaccination-update.php).

As of 8 Apr 2022 at 08:03 PKT (GMT+5), a total of 242 473 429 doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been administered in Pakistan (https://covid.gov.pk/).

As of 3 Apr 2022, Nepal has administered at least 43 549 489 doses of COVID-19 vaccine (https://covid19.who.int/region/searo/country/np).

Sri Lanka has administered at least 39 334 477 doses of COVID vaccines so far. Assuming every person needs 2 doses, that is enough to have vaccinated about 90.2% of the country's population (https://graphics.reuters.com/world-coronavirus-tracker-and-maps/countries-and-territories/sri-lanka/).

To compare the situation in South Asian countries above with previous disease data, ProMED readers are referred to the ProMED-SoAs archives.

The lowest number of confirmed cases recorded so far is from Bhutan (37 049) with 12 deaths. However, considering the population size in the country, the total number of weekly new cases is now proportionately much higher in Bhutan than in other South Asian countries. - Mod.PKB]
