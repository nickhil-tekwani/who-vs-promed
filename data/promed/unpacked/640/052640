A total of 16 people in Kampung Ulu Choh [Johor state] have been
diagnosed with chikungunya, a non-lethal viral fever [seldom lethal.
- Mod.TY] with symptoms similar to dengue. Women and Family
Development, Welfare and Health state Committee chairman, Dr Robia
Kosai, said the victims were infected by the viral fever 2 weeks ago.
It was confirmed on Thursday [24 Apr 2008] that it was chikungunya.

She said although the symptoms were similar to dengue fever, it was
not a life-threatening disease [some deaths attributed to chikungunya
virus infection occurred in the massive chikungunya epidemic that
occurred in Indian Ocean islands 2005-2006 and in India (see
ProMED-mail archive no. 20061224.3598). - Mod.TY]

"It is under control and was not classified as an outbreak.
Chikungunya is a self-limiting disease, which means the patients will
recover from it in due course, while treatment is symptomatic."

Dr Robia said patients would suffer viral fever, including joint
pains and measles-like rashes.

Since the virus is spread by the _Aedes_ mosquito, the same mosquito
that carries the dengue virus, preventive measures such as fogging
and health checks are conducted by the state Health Department in
targeted areas.

"We are urging the public to keep their homes and surrounding areas
clean and free from containers which can be an _Aedes_-breeding
ground," she said.

She added that those who suffered from prolonged fever with rashes
should seek treatment at hospitals.

[Ulu Choh is located in the far south of the Malay Peninsula in an
area on the Straits of Johor (also known as the Straits of Tebrau),
separating Malaysia and Singapore. There were cases in nearby
Singapore 2 months ago [February 2008], so it is not surprising that
there may have been spillover into this area of Malaysia.
