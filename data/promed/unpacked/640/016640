A virus outbreak is being blamed for an unusually large number of
deer found dead in south La Grande [in northeast Oregon; see map and
more information at <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Grande,_Oregon>].
Ten white-tailed deer and 3 mule deer have been found dead in the
past month, according to the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife [ODFW].
Blue tongue, a virus that periodically hits deer populations and
poses no threat to humans, is the likely culprit, said Jim Cadwell,
an ODFW biologist. The disease typically strikes between late August
through October and primarily hits whitetails. The outbreaks, which
occur during dry years, are related to the abundance of tiny biting
flies known as midges.
"When the weather cools the insect is suppressed," Cadwell said. "The
cause of the disease is shot down."
The ODFW was finding about 2 dead deer a day in south La Grande until
the weather cooled a week ago. Then another dead deer was spotted Monday.
Samples taken from the deer were sent to Oregon State University to
be tested. Samples from other deer were not submitted because they
were found well after their deaths. Cadwell said biologists need to
reach a deer within hours after its death for it to be tested for the
virus, which kills by causing internal bleeding.
Dead deer have also been reported at Ladd Marsh this month. Dave
Larson, manager of the Ladd Marsh Wildlife Area, said that a number
of people reported seeing dead deer there during a youth pheasant
hunt 9-10 Sep 2006.

[Epizootic hemorrhagic disease (EHD) is a vector-borne disease that
is not contagious. It is closely related to Bluetongue virus, another
orbivirus. Although Bluetongue virus (BTV) can affect white-tail deer
(_Odocoileus virginianus_), it is more likely that EHD is
responsible. However, samples have been sent to the Oregon
laboratory, so we will await a final report.
These orbiviruses are transmitted most often by Culicoides_ spp. --
biting flies or gnats. In North America it is most often _Culicoides
variipennis_.
Generally when the weather becomes cold enough or there is a freeze
these insects die, and so the disease disappears as well.
The disease generally has a sudden onset, although there is
approximately a 7-day incubation time. Deer are often dead by the
time they are found with the disease. When clinical signs are
observed, the animals are anorexic, weak, they may have no fear of
humans, sometimes there is excessive salivation, and their pulse and
respiration are rapid prior to unconsciousness and death. From the
first clinical signs until death is seldom longer than 36 hours.
There is no treatment. Insect control is helpful but generally very
difficult. Most outbreaks occur in the fall, so the cold weather may
be a limiting factor.
Although this is being reported out of Oregon, there are unofficial
reports that many herds in Indiana have been affected. More
information on this current outbreak and the reports of similar
occurrence in Indiana would be appreciated. - Mod.TG]
