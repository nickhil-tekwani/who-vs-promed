[After 8 days with no newly confirmed cases, 2 cases were posted on the Saudi MOH website. One case had date of confirmation listed as 12 Dec 2019; the other case, today's date. These are the 2nd and 3rd cases reported from Saudi Arabia since 1 Dec 2019. Early in this interval was a report of a fatality in a previously confirmed case.

As previously stated, it appears as though Saudi Arabia has a clear background pattern of sporadic cases with the occasional secondary spread to a healthcare worker or household contact.

The 3 cases reported since the beginning of December each came from a different region (Ash Sharqiyah, Asir and Riyadh). The fatality was the 1st case reported in December 2019 and involved a primary case with known contact with camels. The other 2 cases (just reported today, 14 Dec 2019) are classified as primary cases with an unknown history of camel contact. - Mod.MPP
