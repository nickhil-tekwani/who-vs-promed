A Chinese hospital has received 14 kidney stone patients, all infants
under 11 months who drank the same brand of milk formula, reviving
memories of a milk-powder scandal that killed at least 13 babies.

The infants, from a rural area of northwest Gansu province, were all
admitted in the past 2 months, Xinhua news agency said, citing
doctors at a local hospital.

"It is rare for babies to get kidney stones, let alone so many babies
at the same time," Zhang Wei, a doctor at the Gansu-based No. 1
Hospital of the People's Liberation Army, was quoted as saying.

Parents told the hospital their babies had all been drinking the same
milk powder, Xinhua added without mentioning the brand.

The provincial Public Health Bureau said further investigations would
be carried out to find out whether there was any connection between
the kidney stones and the milk powder.

Kidney stones are small, solid masses that form when salts or
minerals normally found in urine crystallize inside the kidney.

If they become large enough, they can move out of the kidney, cause
infection and lead to permanent kidney damage. In 2004, at least 13
babies in eastern Anhui province died after drinking fake milk powder
that investigators later found had no nutritional value, a scandal
that rocked the country and triggered widespread investigations into
food and health safety.

14 infants from country areas of Gansu Province are suffering from
kidney stones after drinking a particular brand of milk powder.

The latest patient, an 8-month-old infant from Min County, was sent
to the No. 1 Hospital of the Chinese People's Liberation Army in
Lanzhou, the capital city of Gansu, yesterday [8 Sep 2008], Lanzhou
Morning Post reported today [9 Sep 2008].

The infant is the elder of twins. The father said the younger one was
diagnosed with kidney stones in August [2008] and had just been
released from hospital after surgery.

Li Wenhui, a doctor from the urological department of the hospital,
told the newspaper he saw the 1st infant patient on [28 Jun 2008] and
more in the following months. All the infants had the same symptoms.

The ages of the infants range from under 6 months to 11 months,
according to the report, and they came from counties of the province,
including Wushan, Yongjing, Min, Yongdeng, Qin'an.

The youngest patient had been in critical condition, with blood
potassium levels exceeding the norm by 50 percent, and could have
died at any minute.

Doctor Li said kidney stones rarely occur in infants.

The parents of the children all fed their babies with the same brand
of milk powder. The milk powder sells well and is the 1st choice for
young parents in these areas.

The report didn't name the brand or the production. According to the
report, the manager of the company's Lanzhou Office said experts had
been sent to investigate.

An earlier milk powder scandal in Fuyang, Anhui Province killed at
least 13 babies. Hundreds of other babies suffered from "big head"
disease, a condition stemming from malnutrition caused by inferior
milk powder.

The scandal was uncovered in April 2004 and involved several
companies, powder producers, wholesale dealers and officials in
governments and supervisory departments.

[Kidney stones (nephrolithiasis) are relatively rare in infants and
are usually related to metabolic disorders such as cystinuria. In
"Baldwin DN, Spencer JL and Jeffries-Stokes CA. Carbohydrate
intolerance and kidney stones in children in the Goldfields. J of
Paediatrics and Child Health. 2003. 39 (5): 381-385," concerning that
renal stones are common findings in children of the Goldfields region
of Western Australia, the authors hypothesize that "carbohydrate
malabsorption (related to lactose intolerance) together with the
ensuing chronic diarrhea and intraluminal breakdown of sugars by
enteric bacteria may result in a situation of chronic metabolic
acidosis. Chronic metabolic acidosis can lead to protein catabolism,
increased urate excretion and the formation of renal stones."

More information on the findings of investigations into this apparent
"outbreak" of nephrolithiasis (kidney stones) among infants in Gansu,
including biochemical studies on the contents of the implicated milk
powder, would be greatly appreciated.

Deficiencies in quality control in China have led to substandard
pharmaceutical products produced and distributed both domestically
within China as well as internationally (see prior PRO/MBDS and
ProMED-mail postings referenced below). The prior incident of
substandard infant milk powder distributed in China occurred in April
2004, during the height of the SARS epidemic, and seems to have been
missed by ProMED-mail. At that time, substandard infant milk with no
nutritional value was distributed to 11 provinces, Beijing, and
Shanghai, resulting in severe malnutrition of hundreds of infants as
well as the deaths of 13 infants.
