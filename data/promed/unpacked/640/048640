Epizootics [non-human primate cases] notified to National Public Health: 7410 cases
738 confirmed
2225 under investigation
2544 undetermined
1903 discarded

Cases in humans notified: 6565
1257 confirmed (394 deaths)
1499 under investigation
3809 discarded

Beyond the confirmation of new cases, the variation of case numbers and deaths between publication [of these bulletins] is due in part to constant review and reclassification of the cases in light of new data that are incorporated weekly in the database as epidemiological investigations of reported cases bring together key information that has implications for the critical assessment of these events. Thus, there may be a reduction in the number of confirmed cases when the reviewed and reclassified cases outweigh the new cases.

I. Background
-------------
In recent decades, yellow fever (YF) has been recorded beyond the limits of the area considered endemic (Amazon region). At the same time, the observation of a seasonal pattern of occurrence of human cases, based on the analysis of the historical series, supported the adoption of surveillance based on a pattern of seasonality. Thus, the YF monitoring period begins in July and ends in June of the following year. Human cases and epizootics in non-human primates (NHP) have recently been recorded in a wide area of the national territory. Initially, between 2014/2015, the transmission occurred in the North region, with subsequent expansion in the east and south of the country, where it affected primarily the Central West region between 2015/2016. More recently, between 2016/2017, the most significant outbreak in Brazil occurred, affecting mainly the states of the Southeast region, when 779 human cases and 262 deaths were registered, in addition to 1659 YF epizootics reported by [states and the Federal District] in Brazil (Figure 1).

II. Epidemiological situation
-----------------------------
Surveillance of epizootics in non-human primates - NHP (monkeys)

Surveillance of epizootics in non-human primates (NHP) consists of capturing information about the illness or death of NHP (monkeys) and to investigate them in a timely manner, in order to detect early circulation of the yellow virus and to support the decision making for adopting measures of prevention and control, in order to reduce the morbidity and mortality of the disease in the human population, mainly in the affected areas (with active transmission) and its extension (into adjacent areas).

In the monitoring period 2017/2018 (July 2017 to June 2018), up to epidemiological week (EW) 18, 7410 epizootics were reported to the Ministry of Health in NHP, of which 1903 were discarded, 2544 were indeterminate (without samples collected), 2225 remain under investigation, and 738 were confirmed (per laboratory). NHP epizootics were confirmed in: Tocantins (3), Mato Grosso (1), Espirito Santo (2), Rio de Janeiro (39), Minas Gerais (100), and Sao Paulo (593), with the highest number of epizootics confirmed in the Southeast region (99.4 percent, 734/738) (Table 1).

The epidemic curve (Figure 2) shows the maintenance of viral circulation in the period of low occurrence (June to September), when low temperatures and rainfall generally imply conditions less favorable to transmission. Epizootics in NHP confirmed in the states of Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Espirito Santo and Minas Gerais, detected in the same affected areas and close to the previous outbreak (2016/2017), indicated the maintenance of regional transmission and risk to human populations. In the monitoring period 2016/2017 until EW 18, 1548 epizootics were confirmed in NHP, of which 353 met laboratory criteria, while in the current period (2017/2018), 738 epizootics were confirmed (by laboratory) (Figure 3).

Surveillance of human cases
---------------------------
Surveillance of human cases is done through the notification of cases with symptomatology compatible with YF. Every suspected case must be promptly communicated by telephone, fax or email to the authorities, (within 24 hours), as it is a serious disease with risk of dispersion to other areas of national and international territory. It is important to fill out the Investigation form of the Notification of Injury Information System (Sinan).

In the monitoring period 2017/2018 (July / 2017 to June / 2018), up to EW18, 6525 suspected cases of YF were reported, of which 3963 were discarded, 1301 remain under investigation and 1261 were confirmed. Of the total confirmed cases, 409 resulted in death (fatality of 32.4 percent [394 / 1257]). Most confirmed cases were reported in the Southeast region (99.9 percent [1260 / 1261]) (Table 2).

The 1st confirmed human case in this period had the onset of symptoms in mid-July [2017] (Figure 4) with probable site of infection in Guapimirim, Rio de Janeiro, where epizootics in NHP by YF had been detected in the previous month of occurrence of the case. The demographic profile of the confirmed cases coincides with that usually observed in outbreaks of wild-type [sylvan o forest] yellow fever, with the majority of cases in males and of an economically active age, since these individuals are more frequently exposed to areas and risk situations, especially as a result of labor activities (Figure 5).

In the monitoring period 2016/2017 until EW 18, 762 cases of forest yellow fever were confirmed, while in the current period (2017/2018) 1249 were confirmed (Figure 6). In a preliminary comparison between the 2016/2017 monitoring period and the most recent period (2017/2018), it was observed that, although the absolute number of confirmed cases is higher in the current period (762 vs. 1249 included in the analysis, respectively), the incidence of YF per 100 000 inhabitants in municipalities with a record of confirmed human cases was lower (6.43 vs. 3.28) (Table 3). This fact can be explained by the more recent occurrence of YF in areas with greater population contingent (population at risk), since the metropolitan areas of Belo Horizonte, Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo were affected. On the other hand, the number of municipalities with confirmed human cases was higher in the most recent period (222) when compared to the previous one (143). However, the highest population percentage at risk in the current period is precisely that of newly affected areas (58.3 percent), where the vaccine was not recommended (AVNR), differently from the previous period (42.2 percent, reinforces the importance of intensification strategies and vaccination campaigns in newly affected areas, as well as the intensification of selective vaccination where circulation of the virus has previously been documented (AVNR). It is important to consider that part of the municipalities registered YF only in NHP, and the vaccinated portion of the population was not at risk, so this preliminary comparison should be interpreted with caution.

Transmission localities (Affected areas)
----------------------------------------
The human cases and epizootics in NHP recorded during this monitoring period are presented in Tocantins, Federal District, Mato Grosso, Minas Gerais, Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo and Espirito Santo (Figures 7 and 8), where actions to intensify vaccination and are ongoing. All confirmed human cases were in federated unit areas [FA] where NHP epizootics were previously documented by FA (Figures 7 and 8), except for the case confirmed by SES / DF.

Figure 9 [map]. Areas of recommended vaccination, areas without recommended vaccination, areas affected and increased and municipalities participating in the Campaign for Vaccination Against Yellow Fever.

Vaccination against yellow fever
--------------------------------
On [Thu 25 Jan 2018], the Yellow Fever Vaccination Campaign began in 77 municipalities selected from the states of BA, SP and RJ, namely: 8 municipalities (BA); 54 municipalities (SP) and 15 municipalities (RJ). It should be noted that during the course of the Campaign, Sao Paulo expanded vaccination gradually, to another 52 municipalities, according to steps 1 and 2 (Table 4).

With the closure of the Campaign in these municipalities, the vaccination actions continue, in order to guarantee the reach of the vaccination coverage target of 95 percent of the eligible population.

The target population for vaccination consists of people from 9 months of age onward, without proof of vaccination, living in the defined municipalities. It is noteworthy that for this strategy the estimated number of unvaccinated persons is estimated to be vaccinated, approximately 26.5 million people.

In these stated municipalities the yellow fever vaccine in standard doses (0.5 mL) and fractional doses (0.1 mL), that is, a 5th (1/5) of a standard dose (0.5 mL) are used. This measure is in line with the recommendations of the World Health Organization (WHO), because it is in populated areas with risk of disease spread.

From January to May 2018, the Ministry of Health, forwarded to the Federated Area Units the amount of approximately 25.1 million doses of the yellow fever vaccine. For the states of Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Bahia, about 18.4 million doses were sent for the Vaccination Campaign: 13.4 million (SP), 4.7 million (RJ) and 300 000 thousand (BA).

Before starting the Vaccination Campaign, the states of RJ, SP and BA had already vaccinated about 13.2 million people. Considering the total accumulated doses and doses of the Campaign, Rio de Janeiro vaccinated about 6.8 million people, Sao Paulo about 13.3 million and Bahia vaccinated 1.85 million. The vaccination coverage of the states of RJ, SP and BA corresponds to 55.68 percent, 53.62 percent and 55.03 percent of the population, respectively (Table 4).

Table 4. Data of cumulative doses and doses of vaccination against yellow fever, reported by the states of Bahia, Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. Brazil, up to EW 18.

Considering the epidemiological history of the disease in the country, based on the evidence recorded up to June 2017, the area with recommended vaccination was considered according to the classification in Figure 9. The affected areas (in red on the map) indicate the municipalities with active transmission during the current monitoring period (2017/2018), and added to the enlarged areas (in yellow), indicate the areas of risk, where surveillance and response actions are a priority.

Post yellow fever vaccination adverse events
--------------------------------------------
Post vaccination adverse events (PVAE) are any undesired medical occurrence after vaccination and that, not necessarily have a causal relationship to the use of a vaccine or other immunobiologicals. They can be classified as severe adverse events (SAE) when they require hospitalization for at least 24 hours, cause sequelae, congenital anomaly, risk of death or death, and non-adverse events (NAE), which are those that are not included in the SAE.

The yellow fever vaccine is recognized as one of the most effective and safe vaccines; however, SAE have been reported and are related to the dissemination of the vaccine virus [in the body].

Results of the standard dose - campaign
---------------------------------------
From [Thu 25 Jan-Sun 6 May 2018], 1204 PVAE were reported in the states of BA, RJ and SP with the standard dose of the yellow fever vaccine, with 42 (3.5 percent) in BA, 353 (29.3 percent) in RJ, and 809 (67.1 percent) in SP.

Of the 1204 PVAE reported, 357 (29.7 percent) were SAE, 56 (17.2 percent) with 2 (0.6 percent) in BA, 58 (16.3 percent) in RJ and 297 (83 percent) in SP. The data presented for the standard dose are reported cases and are still under investigation for completion and are subject to change.

Results of the fractionated dose - campaign
-----------------------------------------
In the period from [Thu 25 Jan-Sun 6 May 2018], 897 PVAE were reported in the states of RJ and SP with the fractionated dose of the yellow fever vaccine, of which 159 (17.7 percent) were in RJ and 738 (82.2 percent) in SP. There was no BA state notification of any cases of PVAE with the fractional dose of the yellow fever vaccine in the above-mentioned period. Regarding severity, 158 SAE cases occurred, 27 (17 percent) in RJ and 131 (83 percent) in SP. The data presented for fractional dose are reported cases and are still under investigation for conclusion and are subject to change.

[This current update from the Brazil Ministry of Health gives the latest detailed summary of the yellow fever situation in Brazil, including cases in humans as well as in monkeys. As noted in previous comments, despite the occurrence of human cases in a relatively wide geographic area in the country, all are attributed to spillover from the sylvan (forest) transmission cycle and none to the urban cycle involving human-to-human transmission, via _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito vectors. This is remarkable, considering that this mosquito is abundant and responsible for transmission of Zika, chikungunya, and dengue viruses in recent outbreaks in Brazil. The vaccination campaign has been running behind schedule, but efforts are being made to catch up. A recent decision has been made to vaccinate the entire 77 million population of Brazil within the next 12 months. Apparently, supplies of the vaccine are adequate for the current phase of the campaign, doubtless facilitated by the application of fractionated dose that extends the supply 5-fold. One hopes that vaccination coverage of the population will soon reach the 80-95 percent level in areas at risk and end new human cases. The sylvan cycle will probably continue, since there is no way to vaccinate the non-human primate population.
