Information received on 15 Mar 2006 from Dr. Junaidu A. Maina, Acting

End of this report period: 15 Mar 2006.

Details of new outbreaks:
12 new outbreaks are reported in Bauchi (1), Jigwa (1), Kaduna (2), Kano
(2), Katsina (2), Lagos (2), Ogun (1) and Plateau (1) states.
The largest outbreak is in Ogun state, where there were 94 000 deaths from
a 135 000 bird flock. The outbreaks in Lagos are at Agege. See map at
<http://encarta.msn.com/map_701515127/Nigeria.html>.
Description of affected populations:
- At Gayawa Mallam village in Jigawa State and at Dargage village in
Katsina State, the affected animals were free-range local birds.
- At Vom (Jos South, Plateau State), the case was in a wild vulture.
- The rest of the affected farms are commercial and backyard poultry layer
production units in towns.
Diagnosis:
Laboratory where diagnostic tests were performed: National Veterinary
Research Institute, Vom, Nigeria; hemagglutination test; agar gel
immunodiffusion test; virus isolation; RT-PCR: positive.
[The outbreak in Ogun and 2 in Lagos indicated the outbreak has spread to
most of the country. Lagos has been cited by some as Sub-Saharan Africa's
most populous city. This new information only reinforces previous concerns
about the untoward turn of events in West Africa in terms of the prospect
of the disease becoming endemic. The Nigerian animal health authorities are
to be congratulated on their concerted efforts to report the disease and
promote transparency. - Mod.PC]
