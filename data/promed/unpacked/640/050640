Bandung, West Java -- bird flu suspect
--------------------------------------
A 50-year-old female resident of Karawang District is suspected to
have contracted bird flu virus. The victim was admitted to Hasan
Sadikin hospital at 8 pm Sun 29 Mar 2009 by recommendation of Dewi Sri
clinic, Karawang.

According to the patient's 40-year-old wife, her husband developed
fever and breathing difficulty signs. He was then brought to Ramerta
clinic and then directed to the Dewi Sri clinic. The patient's wife
said that the doctor at Dewi Sri clinic told her that her husband has
developed bird flu symptoms, but [the diagnosis] had still to be
confirmed.

The woman also mentioned that her husband had fever and breathing
problems before Sat 21 Mar 2009. But then the symptoms had recovered
[diminished?] by Mon 23 Mar 2009. During the past 2 weeks a number of
chickens were found suddenly dead in the victim's area. "My husband is
the only onewho developed symptoms," she added.

[Apart from the proximity to diseased poultry, there is no compelling
evidence to suggest that this is a human case of avian influenza.
