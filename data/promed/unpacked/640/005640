----------------------------------------------------------------------
One other explanation for the recent outbreak in Mexico is relapsing
fever. Over 350 cases of relapsing fever were officially reported in
the country in 2008. Similar outbreaks of febrile illness are reported
in Israel, among groups of people exposed to caves or military bunkers
(the Hebrew term for relapsing fever translates as "cave fever"). The
Israeli pathogen, _Borrelia persica_, is acquired from the bites of
_Ornithodoros tholozani_; while the Mexican pathogen, _Borrelia
turicatae_, is transmitted by _Ornithodoros turicata_. Both _O.
tholozani_ and _O. turicata_ are known to infest bats.
