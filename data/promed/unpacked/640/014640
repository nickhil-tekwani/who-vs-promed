[David Thompson sent the following comment in response to the 23 Sep
2009 ProMED-mail post (archive no. 20090923.3343) reporting the
current Ross River virus [RRV] outbreak in Australia's Northern
Territory. - Mod.TY]

It may be enlightening to see if they [veterinarians] have recorded
any transient fever with more persistent poly or shifting arthritis
or tenosynovitis in horses in the Darwin area this year [2009].
Symptoms are usually also quite common in horses during bad RRV years.

[Ross River virus human infections are proportionally more frequent
in the Northern Territory than in other states. Dr Steve Berger,
Geographic Medicine, Tel Aviv Medical Center, comments that the
recent Ross River virus outbreak in Australia serves as a classic
exercise in epidemiology. Although Queensland and New South Wales
account for most cases of Ross River disease, rates per 100 000 are
consistently highest in the Northern Territory. (See GIDEON [Global
Infectious Disease & Epidemiology Network] graphs at
<http://www.gideononline.com/blog/2009/09/24/ross-river-disease-northern-territory/>)

Whether equine Ross River virus cases are common is an interesting
question. A 2008 report from southwestern Victoria state indicated
that horses infected by Ross River virus may develop clinical
disease. Although no virus was isolated from horses in that study,
elevated Ross River virus IgM antibody was found in horses presenting
with clinical signs including petechial haemorrhages,
lymphadenopathy, distal limb swelling, and reluctance to move.

[Horses more often than other animals are diagnosed with RRV. Horses
demonstrate stiffness, arthritis, and joint swellings, which may
become infected. Horses may develop a fever with the arthralgia, but
not all horses develop the fever. Horses can develop a viral toxemia
and can die from this disease. Horses may also survive the disease
and supposedly have lifetime immunity.

Other animals including dogs, cats, and rodents are susceptible to
the virus. However, they are not as frequently diagnosed with RRV.

Rodents and the flying fox bat may be the reservoirs for the virus.
The evidence is not conclusive on either of these species.

Australia's equine industry has had a tough year with Hendra and now
RRV, both coming on the heels of equine influenza. - Mod.TG]
