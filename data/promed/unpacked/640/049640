MOOSE DIE-OFF - USA (ALASKA) (02)

At this point, speculation about species, or even genus, is rampant but
unhelpful! It is probably a protostrongylid (_Parelaphostrongylus_ or
_Elaphostrongylus_), but filarioid nematodes (_Setaria cervi_) have turned
up in moose in Europe and Asia, and cause neurological signs in cervids.
Based on DNA sequencing of larvae in feces, we have found
_Parelaphostrongylus odocoilei_ in Dall's sheep in the central Alaska range
(paper in prep).
_P. odocoilei_ is also likely present in black-tailed deer in the coastal
range of AK. Recently, thinhorn sheep experimentally infected with _P.
odocoilei_ developed neurological signs very similar to those in hosts
infected with _P. tenuis_ or _E. rangiferi_ (paper in prep). Therefore, in
addition to other protostrongylids known to have a neural migration, _P.
odocoilei_ is a possible differential diagnosis and is known to be in Alaska.
The game-ranched elk are also interesting; they are one of the few
"accidental" hosts that will shed _P. tenuis_ larvae, and there is a
possibility of introduction with translocated elk from eastern North America.
If any nematodes, adult or larval, can be recovered from the moose or
sympatric ungulates, we can sequence them and rule in or out the
protostrongylids known to be in North America (_Elaphostrongylus
rangiferi_, _Parelaphostrongylus tenuis_, _P. andersoni_, _P. odocoilei_,
as well as _Elaphostrongylus alces_, not known to be in North America but
present in moose in Fennoscandia). We prefer them to be in saline, but
alcohol-fixed and, apparently, formalin-fixed (Junnila, 2002) specimens can
also be used. I suspect the amount of parasite material in a histological
section would be too small for our methods.
Finding adult protostrongylid parasites in the CNS [Central Nervous System]
or muscles is very difficult in normal hosts, and may not be possible in
lightly infected or abnormal hosts. But without molecular identification,
the only way to positively identify the species is to recover and identify
adult male nematodes using specialized morphometrics.
There are very few people in North America who can do either molecular or
morphological identification of protostrongylids. To my knowledge, in
addition to us (Research Group for Arctic Parasitology in Saskatoon, SK),
there is the Centre for Animal Parasitology, CFIA, Saskatoon (A Gajadhar
and M Lankester), and the US National Parasite Collection & Animal
Parasitic Disease Laboratory, USDA, Agricultural Research Service,
Beltsville, Maryland (E Hoberg and B Rosenthal). There may well be more
that I am not aware of.
