Kilimanjaro fails to meet production targets
--------------------------------------------
Some 1.5 million tonnes of cash and food crops were harvested in
Kilimanjaro region, of the projected 1.7 million tonnes last financial year.

Mrs Hilda Mkamba, an agricultural expert at the regional secretariat,
informed delegates of the Regional Consultative Committee (RCC) that during
last rainy season, sunflower production was very poor as the crop continued
to be attacked by "powdery mildew", a devastating powder-like fungus.
Farmers have been advised to plant certified seeds during the next crop
season to contain the plant disease.

Despite the achievement in irrigated agriculture, Moshi, Mwanga, Rombo, and
Same districts were faced with shortage of food and needed subsidized or
affordable food supplies.

[Powdery mildew of sunflower is caused by the fungus _Golovinomyces
cichoracearum_ var. _cichoracearum_ and can cause serious economic losses
in crops growing in warmer regions. It causes white 'powdery' growth on
leaves and other plant parts, which may coat large areas. The disease can
seriously reduce the vigour of the host affecting crop yield. The fungus is
spread with wind, water, and mechanical means and survives on crop residue.
Disease management relies mainly on fungicides. Partial genetic resistance
has been reported in commercial sunflower, but additional resistance in
wild relatives (_Helianthus_ species) has been shown to be available for
possible use in interspecific crosses.

While _G. cichoracearum_ (formerly _Erysiphe cichoracearum_) has a wide
host range and geographical distribution, numerous races exist, which can
be distinguished by molecular analysis. They are usually specific to a
small number of hosts. Some strains of the pathogen can cause serious
disease in melons and other cucurbits.
