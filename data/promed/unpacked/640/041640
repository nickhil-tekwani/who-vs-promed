About 14 000 broiler ducks at 3 farms in Pingtung County's Yanpu and Kaoshu townships were culled on Thursday [3 Sep 2015] after it was discovered they were infected with avian influenza, the 2nd confirmed case in Pingtung County within a week.

Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine Director-General Chang Su-san said ducks at the 3 farms were found to have contracted a new strain of the avian influenza H5 subtype virus on Wednesday [2 Sep 2015], and a full culling was conducted at the affected farms on Thursday.

Chang said the 3 farms are within a 1-km radius of a farm in Pingtung's Sinyuan Township, where 5780 broiler ducks infected with the H5 subtype virus were culled last Thursday [3 Sep 2015].

She said the ducks culled this week were healthy, but preventive culling was conducted in accordance with epidemic prevention regulations, adding that the bureau instructed farmers to disinfect and clean the animals' enclosures to prevent the spread of the virus.

Ducks are potential carriers of avian influenza that exhibit few symptoms and low mortality rates when infected.

The bureau said it will now take samples from all farms within a 1-km radius of the affected farms.

Any operators that refuse the bureau's inspection will face a fine of between NTD 30 000 and NTD 150 000 (USD 913 and USD 4569), and those who fail to report any erratic farm animal deaths will face a maximum fine of NTD one million [USD 30 000], Chang said

The Pingtung outbreak is the latest in a series of reported cases since ducks and chickens at farms in Chiayi and Changhau counties were found infected with avian influenza late last month [August 2015]. The total number of ducks and chickens culled this year [2015] has exceeded 5 million, the bureau said.

The bureau said a serious outbreak might occur in the autumn [2015] and has called on epidemic prevention officers to thoroughly disinfect affected facilities, as well as vehicles and equipment used for disease control purposes.
