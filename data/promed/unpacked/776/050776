Hepatitis broke out in the temple town of Kangra today [19 Dec 2014] in epidemic form, and the health authorities identified 55 patients including children below the age of 15. The Health Department asked the IPH authorities to super chlorinate the water sources immediately before it spreads further.

Kangra district epidemiologist and district surveillance officer R K Sood said that the disease started from ward 1 and 3 of old Kangra locality, and he visited personally today [19 Dec 2014] to supervise house to house case search operations in the area. He said 3000 residents in the population of more than 10 000 was checked today, and 55 patients were detected, which included 37 children.

He said the patients were detected from Old Kangra, Guptganga, Tehsil Chowk, Ronkhar, surrounding areas of Polytechnic college Kangra, SDM Complex, and almost the entire town was affected, he added. He said that being a waterborne disease, contaminated water initiated the problem in old Kangra locality in the 1st instance. He said water samples were being tested.

Dr Sood said that out of 55 patients, 26 were detected during house to house searches, and 29 had reported to different hospitals.

A joint team of health department ICDS and IPH departments has been formulated to combat the epidemic. Dr Sood said that the incubation period of the disease is up to 20 days. Super-chlorination has been started; however, people affected before super-chlorination will continue to develop symptoms for another 2 weeks.

[As a consequence of poor sanitary conditions and hygienic practices in many developing countries, most children (up to 90 per cent) have been infected with the hepatitis A virus before the age of 10. Those infected in childhood do not often experience any noticeable symptoms. Consequently, epidemics are uncommon because older children and adults are generally immune. Symptomatic disease rates in these areas are low, and outbreaks are rare.

Because of this, the cause of this outbreak is likely to be the other food/waterborne form of viral hepatitis, hepatitis E. Hepatitis E virus (HEV), which is transmitted via the fecal-oral route, is the commonest cause of acute viral hepatitis globally. Large HEV outbreaks have been documented in crowded settings that have poor water, sanitation, and hygiene conditions. Pregnant women suffer disproportionately high mortality from hepatitis E.

A recombinant, 3-dose series HEV vaccine has been produced but has not yet been pre-qualified by WHO. The vaccine has been shown to prevent symptomatic HEV infection and proven to be safe and effective in people aged 16-64 years. Limited vaccine safety data in 37 pregnant women receiving 57 doses have been reported; however, further research is needed, and safety for children is unknown. The vaccine is expected to be protective against HEV genotype 1, the strain associated with most waterborne outbreaks in Africa and Asia. - Mod.LL
