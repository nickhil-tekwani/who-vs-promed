Issa Mohamed Moussa Yousef, Minister of Health in Central Darfur, announced the emergence of 2 new cases of yellow fever in the localities of Zalingei and Umm Dukhun. The new cases bring the total incidence to 413 and the death toll to 81 in Central Darfur, according to the latest statistics issued on Wednesday [12 Dec 2012].

The minister explained to Radio Dabanga that, overall, the incidence of yellow fever in the locality comes from the gold mining area of Jebel 'Amer in North Darfur. He pointed out that no new cases emerged in Central Darfur and asserted that the situation has stabilized.

About the upcoming vaccination campaign in the localities of Mukjar and Bendessey, the minister stressed that the vaccines against yellow fever arrived in Khartoum but have not yet arrived in the state.

He added that the state has completed all preparatory arrangements for the campaign in both localities and is waiting for the arrival of the drugs [vaccine].

[Although the date when the Central Darfur Minister of Health gave the above statement is not given, the numbers of cases and fatalities have increased over the previous report. Without the arrival of the next lot of vaccines and the occurrence of new cases in Central Darfur, it is difficult to understand why the situation has been declared stabilized. It is good to learn that preparations have been made to launch the vaccination campaign as soon as the vaccine arrives from Khartoum.

This above report also indicates that the African section of the Arab League has allocated USD 250 000 for the purchase of vaccines for Darfur.
