Equine piroplasmosis, Japan
-------------------------
Report type: immediate notification
Started: 24 Jul 2021
Confirmed: 24 Jul 2021
Reported: 26 Jul 2021
Reason for notification: 1st occurrence in the country
Causal agent: _Theileria equi_
Nature of diagnosis: clinical, laboratory
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country.

Outbreak location: Equestrian Park, Setagaya, Tokyo
Started: 24 Jul 2021
Ended: ongoing
Epidemiological unit: other
Affected animals:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered or killed for commercial use / Vaccinated
Equidae / 1 / 1 / 0 / 0 / 0 / 0

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreaks(s): unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: the horse developed clinical signs (fever and anemia) suggesting protozoal infections in the morning on 24 July. Blood sample was immediately collected and tested for equine piroplasmosis (both _Theileria equi_ and _Babesia caballi_) at the Equine Research Institute of Japan Racing Association and found to be _Theileria equi_ positive, on the same day of the evening, by blood smear microscopic test and PCR while the indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT) for both _T. equi_ and _B. caballi_ resulted negative. The affected horse has been moved to the isolation unit in a sanitary manner and the original stable was cleaned and disinfected in the morning on [25 Jul 2021], under the supervision of veterinary biosecurity coordinator (VBC) and MAFF [Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries]. The affected horse has been continuously isolated since its arrival to Japan. Passive surveillance is being conducted in the EDFZ and no other horses in the EDFZ have not developed any clinical signs suggestive for the disease. Biosecurity of the venue: Equine disease-free zone (EDFZ) has been established in the venue in accordance with the OIE guidelines on the establishment, management, and self-declaration to the OIE of an equine disease-free zone including freedom from equine piroplasmosis. The venue was declared free from ticks competent to transmit the disease following a five-year tick surveillance and in addition to that, the venue has been disinfected and vector control has been carried out prior to any horse arrivals [21 to 24 Jun 2021]. Moreover, all horses lodged in the venue are kept separately in a compartment surrounded by wall so that any physical contact with other horses as well as contamination with litters and other fomites is prevented. The cause of infection is not yet known, but considering the incubation period of _T. equi_ and the abovementioned set of biosecurity measures, it is considered unlikely that the index horse could have been infected after arrival. Moreover, given that the index horse was immediately placed under quarantine in a dedicated isolation area and there has been no additional cases identified by monitoring in accordance with the established Standard Operating Procedures of the EDFZ, thus the free status of the zone (EDFZ) is considered to be retained.

Control measures at event level
Domestic control measures applied: surveillance within containment and or the protection zone; movement control inside the country; disinfection; quarantine; control of vectors; vector surveillance; traceability; treatment.

["Equine piroplasmosis is a tick-borne protozoal disease of horses, mules, donkeys, and zebra. The etiological agents are blood parasites named _Theileria equi_ and _Babesia caballi_. Infected animals may remain carriers of these parasites for long periods and act as sources of infection for ticks, which act as vectors. These parasites are also easily spread by blood contaminated instruments.

"The introduction of carrier animals into areas where tick vectors are prevalent can lead to an epizootic spread of the disease."

"The clinical signs of equine piroplasmosis are often nonspecific, and the disease can easily be confused with other conditions. Piroplasmosis can occur in peracute, acute, and chronic forms. The acute cases are more common, and are characterised by fever that usually exceeds 40d deg C [104 deg F], reduced appetite, and malaise, elevated respiratory and pulse rates, congestion of mucous membranes, and faecal balls that are smaller and drier than normal.

"Clinical signs in subacute cases are similar. In addition, affected animals show loss of weight, and fever is sometimes intermittent. The mucous membranes vary from pale pink to pink, or pale yellow to bright yellow.

"Petechiae and/or ecchymoses may also be visible on the mucous membranes. Normal bowel movements may be slightly depressed and the animals may show signs of mild colic. Mild oedematous swelling of the distal part of the limbs sometimes occurs.

"Chronic cases usually present nonspecific clinical signs such as mild inappetence, poor performance and a drop in body mass. The spleen is usually found to be enlarged on rectal examination.

"A rare peracute form where horses are found either dead or moribund has been reported."

"There are no vaccines available."
