A contagious disease that causes cows to spontaneously abort their
calves has been detected in 3 [British Columbia] animals sent to a US
slaughterhouse.

Rob McNabb, spokesman for the Canadian Cattlemen's Association, said
[Wed 26 May 2010] the cows that had brucellosis came from herds on 2
farms.

He said the last case of brucellosis, which is mostly transmitted
from cows to calves through milk or birth fluids, occurred in Canada
in 1989.

Mr McNabb said the Canadian Food Inspection Agency will likely
confirm the US results, but additional testing is being done because
false positive tests have been a problem in the past.

Keith Lehman, a spokesman for the agency, said the unidentified farms
have been quarantined and blood samples taken from their herds to
determine if any of the animals have the disease. He said preliminary
results could be completed by next week [week of 31 May 2010]. But
meanwhile, the agency continues investigating the movement of cattle
to and from the farms in an effort to determine the origin of the
brucellosis.

It's not known why the disease would make a comeback after it was
thought to have been eradicated 20 years ago. "We worked very hard,
probably in the mid-1900s to the later 1900s, at eradicating
brucellosis from the Canadian herd and that was done through a
slaughter and testing program," Mr. Lehman said.

People can contract undulant fever [brucellosis in humans] by
drinking unpasteurized milk from infected cows or through contact
with animal tissue during the slaughter process if good sanitary
measures aren't used, Mr. Lehman said.

Symptoms include joint and muscle pain.

[Clearly the Canadians are doing a thorough epidemiological
investigation to learn where the disease originated. They will be
testing the herd of origin and likely, any animals that have moved
into the herd or been removed from the herd (trace-ins and
trace-outs) in an effort to locate any nidus of infection within any
other herds of contact.

The disease in cattle, water buffalo, and bison is caused almost
exclusively by _Brucella abortus_ ; however, _B. suis or _B.
melitensis_ are occasionally implicated in some cattle herds. _B.
suis_ does not appear to be contagious from cow to cow. Infection
spreads rapidly and causes many abortions in unvaccinated cattle. In
a herd in which the disease is endemic, an infected cow typically
aborts only once after exposure; subsequent gestations and lactations
appear normal. After exposure, cattle become bacteremic for a short
period and develop agglutinins and other antibodies; some resist
infection and a small percentage of infected cows recover. A positive
serum agglutination test usually precedes an abortion or a normal
parturition but may be delayed in about 15 per cent of cows. The
incubation period may be variable and is inversely related to stage
of gestation at time of exposure. Organisms are shed in milk and
uterine discharges, and the cow may become temporarily infertile.
Bacteria may be found in the uterus during pregnancy, uterine
involution, and infrequently, for a prolonged time, in the non-gravid
uterus. Shedding from the vagina largely disappears with the decrease
of fluids following parturition. Some infected cows that previously
aborted shed brucellae from the uterus at subsequent normal
parturitions. Organisms are shed in milk for a variable length of
time -- in most cattle for life.

Natural transmission occurs by ingestion of organisms, which are
present in large numbers in aborted fetuses, fetal membranes, and
uterine discharges. Cattle may ingest contaminated feed and water, or
lick contaminated genitals of other animals. Venereal transmission by
infected bulls to susceptible cows appears to be rare. Transmission
may occur by artificial insemination when _Brucella_ -contaminated
semen is deposited in the uterus but, reportedly, not when deposited
in the mid-cervix. Brucellae may enter the body through mucous
membranes, conjunctivae, wounds, or intact skin.

Brucellae have been recovered from fetuses and from manure that has
remained in a cool environment for more than 2 months. Exposure to
direct sunlight kills the organisms within a few hours.

Because organisms are shed in the milk, unpasteurized milk, and
cheese represent a human health concern. Many individuals believe
drinking unpasteurized milk is better for their health. Diseases that
are not killed by pasteurization represent a risk to the consumer.
Brucellosis in humans (undulant fever, Malta fever) causes malaise,
fever, chills, sweats, headache, neck pain, low back pain, joint
pain, muscle pain, occasionally diarrhea, constipation, anorexia,
weight loss, abdominal pain, weakness, irritability, insomnia, and
depression. Brucellosis has been called undulant fever because of its
habit of producing fever and signs that wax and wane over an extended
period of time.
