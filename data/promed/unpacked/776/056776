Regarding the change of food supply for the herbivores in that zoo, I recall
an outbreak of hemorrhage with fatalities in racing camels (_Camelus
dromedarius_) in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, a couple of years ago.
Investigators from the Central Veterinary Research Laboratory there found
high levels (up to 2 x 10 to the 8 colony forming units per gram) of
_Bacillus cereus_ in alfalfa and manure imported from Pakistan.

[I can understand importing forage for camels, but manure? Maybe it was in
the faeces from the affected racing camels. - Mod.MHJ
