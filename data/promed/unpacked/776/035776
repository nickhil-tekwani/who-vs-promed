RINDERPEST IN PAKISTAN:
The Delegate declares the country "provisionally free" from this disease
------------------
(Information received on 29 Jan 2003 from Mr Rafaqat Hussain Raja, Animal
Husbandry Commissioner, Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Livestock, Islamabad)
Report date: 29 Jan 2003.
Serious rinderpest epizootics occurred in Pakistan between 1990 and 1995,
stimulating Pakistan to embark on an eradication programme in line with its
commitment to the Global Rinderpest Eradication Programme. This greatly
reduced the incidence of rinderpest outbreaks. In 2000, an analysis of
earlier information indicated that rinderpest was mainly associated with
the peri-urban dairy colonies in Karachi and/or small-scale livestock
farmers in the interior of Sindh province, in the southern part of the
country. With the assistance of the FAO(1) and the European Union, Pakistan
embarked in 2000 on a broad programme of strengthening disease surveillance
at both national and provincial levels with special emphasis on rinderpest.
The last cases of rinderpest were detected and confirmed by laboratory
tests in September 2000 in a buffalo dairy farm in Karachi in Sindh
province(2).
In a deliberate attempt to uncover any residual foci of infection,
generalised rinderpest vaccination was withdrawn in November 2000. Since
then, there has been no confirmed report of rinderpest anywhere in the country.
Passive and intensive active disease surveillance systems incorporating
participatory disease searching and concerted investigations --
concentrated particularly, but not exclusively, in areas considered at high
risk for rinderpest transmission -- have provided no evidence that
rinderpest has occurred in the last 2 years in the Indus River buffalo
tract (which used to be a rinderpest stronghold) nor anywhere else in the
country. Combined with this, ongoing purposive serosurveillance studies
using the OIE-prescribed competitive ELISA(3) (approximately 15 000 sera)
are similarly supportive of the view that rinderpest virus has ceased to
circulate in Pakistan.
Rinderpest vaccination remains prohibited for all species except in an
emergency. All rinderpest vaccine stocks have been withdrawn from field
offices and are now contained in 3 vaccine banks for use in an emergency,
should they be needed. Issuing of rinderpest vaccine in these circumstances
requires authorization by the Animal Husbandry Commissioner on a
case-by-case basis.
Homologous vaccine is being supplied instead of rinderpest vaccine for
protection of small ruminants against peste des petits ruminants.
Based on this information, the Delegate of Pakistan to the OIE declares the
whole of the Pakistan territory as "a country provisionally free from
rinderpest" [beginning] 1 Jan 2003.
