Salmonellosis has hospitalized 24 people after one of the biggest foodborne illness outbreaks in Queensland. Queensland Health has confirmed that 175 people have fallen ill after eating at the Brisbane Convention and Exhibition Centre on Thursday and Friday, 26-27 Feb 2015. None of the people that have been hospitalized is in a critical condition, but their conditions vary, with the illness "exacerbating" some pre-existing conditions, chief health officer Dr Jeannette Young said.

Authorities are working out what food on the "variable" menu was eaten by the people who fell ill. Dr Young said the "usual causes" of salmonellosis were poorly cooked meat, poultry and eggs.

Queensland Health was alerted on Sun 1 Mar 2015 that the people had fallen ill. All of the people who have fallen sick attended a conference for Queensland state school principals. There are about 4000 cases of salmonella in Queensland every year.

The Brisbane Convention and Exhibition Centre says it is investigating its food supply chain in the wake of the mass outbreak. A spokeswoman said it underwent "rigorous" council, state government and external health audits prior to last year's [2014] G20 Leaders' Summit. There were the "strictest food safety requirements" in place, and the outbreak was the 1st of its kind for the centre, which hosts 1300 events a year. "We are taking this matter very seriously, and we are cooperating fully with Queensland Health," the spokeswoman said.

Delegates were served morning tea and lunch as well as finger food on Thursday evening, 26 Feb 2015. Prawns and cold smoked salmon were among the food served. One sick principal questioned food handling standards. "All the hot food -- curry and rice and so on -- was in pretty white bowls without heating. Not a bain-marie in sight," the principal said. Queensland Secondary Principals' Association president Andrew Pierpoint said an email was sent to principals yesterday, 3 Mar 2015, urging them to contact a doctor if they felt ill.
