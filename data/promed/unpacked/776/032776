[This thread name was retroactively changed from "Trypanosomiasis,
foodborne - South America" to "Trypanosomiasis, foodborne - Brazil (Santa
Catarina)" to reflect the lack of cases outside of Brazil and to
distinguish this outbreak from another similar, but unrelated outbreak
elsewhere in Brazil. - Mod.MPP]

Further information on the outbreak of Chagas in Brazil
--------------------------------------------------
I am sorry for taking so long to write you back about this completely
odd outbreak, but we are up to our eyeballs of work and questions.
Many of the questions are still to be answered, but I believe it is
in our group's interest that I sum it up.

1. Santa Catarina is very important state for tourism in the south of
Brazil, with many gorgeous beaches; it is very well prepared to
welcome tourists.

2. Sugar cane juice, also known as "garapa," is a very common
beverage all over the country and is made by crushing the cane. The
triatomid insect vector may have been crushed during this process, or
the cane could have become contaminated with infected bugs' feces.

3. So far there have been 25 confirmed cases (around 14 suspicious
and symptomatic) and 6 deaths. There may have been more than 50 000
possible exposures (which includes international travellers) .

4. All cases are apparently related to drinking garapa in cities
along the northern beaches of the State (to name all the suspicious
cities: Itapoa, Garuva, Joinville, Araquari, Sao Francisco do Sul,
Balneario Barra do Sul, Barra Velha, Picarras, Penha, Navegantes,
Itajai, Balnearion Camboriu, Camboriu, and Itapema). All are close to
the federal road named BR 101.

5. There are 2 research papers referring to previous outbreaks of
Chagas disease associated with the oral route of transmission (1968 -
Teutonia RS and 1991 - Catole do Rocha PB), the larger of which
presents 26 confirmed cases.

6. Incubation period seems to be around 7-28 days, and the main signs
and symptoms include high fever for more than 5 days; myalgia;
headache; orbital swelling and hepatosplenomegaly. In such cases
diagnosis must be confirmed with serology (remember that many labs
perform only IgG); IgM and direct visualization on smears.

7. Treatment with either benzonidazol or nifurtimox must be provided
ASAP for all acute cases, especially symptomatic ones. Cure rates are
around 70 percent.

8. For diagnosis in asymptomatic cases, we are recommending just
serology IgG and IgM. In negative cases with more than 30 days
elapsed from exposure, close the case; less than 30 days, repeat
serology within 2-4 weeks.

9. All positive cases must be confirmed with a 2nd serological exam
or direct visualization of _T. cruzi_.

[ProMED is grateful to Dr Rocha for supplying this additional very
useful information. The main factor for the risk of spreading Chagas
disease by food and drink is the survival of the trypanosomes after
they have left the intestine of the triatomid bug. How sensitive are
they to changes in temperature, pH, and osmolarity? This will
determine how long they can stay infective in bug feces on sugar cane.

ProMED would appreciate if anyone can provide data or knowledge of
studies of this aspect of the infection. For the time being it is not
possible to estimate the extent of the outbreak. - Mod.EP]
