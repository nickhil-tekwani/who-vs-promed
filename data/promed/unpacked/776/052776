On Saturday [7 Apr 2007], [Mahmoud] Najdawi, [Jordan's Ministry of
Agriculture's spokesperson] said a delegation from the Saudi
agriculture ministry is due to visit the Kingdom soon to examine
health procedures in the country on breeding livestock.
Saudi Arabia suspended the import of livestock from Jordan early this
year [2007] after anthrax fever was detected in cattle from some
areas in the country.
According to the ministry figures, a total of 440 000 live cattle
were exported to Saudi Arabia at a total value of JD 36 million [USD
50.8 million] last year [2006].

[The above newswire is posted by ProMED-mail for the following reasons:
1. Anthrax, endemic in Jordan (as in most countries), is usually not
regarded as a typical trans-boundary animal disease (TAD); it is
doubtful that this was the cause for the Saudi restrictions;
confirmation or otherwise will help. It is more likely that a serious
TAD was at stake.
2. Two important epizootic cattle diseases are known to have recently
affected Jordanian cattle: Foot and Mouth disease (FMD) of serotypes
A and O, officially notified to the OIE in January 2007; and
Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease (EHD), known to have been observed in
Jordan during November-December 2006 (see archive 20061215.3525) but
not notified. Have the Saudi restrictions been, in fact, related to
one of those TADS?
3. The Jordanian export figures are also of interest. Jordan's
national cattle population (2005 figures) is 69 100 strong, while the
number of live cattle exported from Jordan to Saudi Arabia during
2006, according to the above newswire, was 440 000. The discrepancy
between those figures is explained by the fact that Jordan is a
transit country for cattle and sheep en route to other Middle Eastern
countries, including Saudi Arabia. It might be assumed that the Saudi
import restrictions were, in fact, related to cattle originating
outside Jordan.
FMDV of serotype O has been reported to be circulating in Israel and
the Palestinian Authority (PA) since January 2007, affecting large
and small ruminants and even wildlife (gazelles). See FMD map for
Israel at
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=event_summary&this_country_code=ISR&public_disease=1&reportid=4351>
and for the PA at
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=event_summary&this_country_code=PSE&public_disease=1&reportid=4851>.
The updated FMD (an extremely infectious disease) situation in
adjacent areas within neighboring Jordan, where the epizootic started
in November 2006 and was reported (once) in January 2007, is not
clear. Updated information (preferably a follow-up report) will be appreciated.
Information on the FMD-disease situation in other regional countries,
particularly Syria and Lebanon, will also be helpful. - Mod.AS]
