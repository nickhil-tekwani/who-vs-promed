The Department of Health (DOH) Center for Health Development 6 here
noted an increase in measles cases in Western Visayas, with Iloilo top
of the list registering 33 out of the 41 confirmed measles laboratory
results. Dr. Renilyn P. Reyes, CHD regional coordinator for the
Expanded Program for Immunization (EPI), said there is a resurgence of
measles cases in the region, although there are no recorded deaths.

In 2008, there were no recorded measles cases in Iloilo and Panay. The
provinces of Antique, Capiz and Negros Occidental have 3 cases each of
measles, and Guimaras has 5. Iloilo, including Iloilo City, component
city of Passi and 41 municipalities have 33 cases. Of the 33 confirmed
measles cases in Iloilo, Iloilo City has 15 confirmed measles cases,
and 18 are registered in the 10 municipalities in the province and the
component city of Passi.

Jaro II has 4 cases while La Paz and Mandurriao districts have 3 cases
each. Jaro I has 2 confirmed cases. The districts of Arevalo, Molo and
City Proper have one case each.

In the CHD-DOH figures, the town of Oton has the largest number of
measles cases with 5, Pavia, 3 and Banate, 2. The municipalities of
Pototan, Duenas, Anilao, Dumangas, Sta. Barbara, Leganes, Sara and
Passi City have one measles case each.

Reyes said measles ranks as one of the leading causes of childhood
mortality in the world. It is considered to be a "vaccine preventable
disease," and humans are the only natural host of the measles virus.
The disease is not deadly except for the complications it brings to
the patient. The complications include diarrhea, otitis media,
pneumonia, croup and encephalitis. There are no anti-viral drugs for
measles [virus infection]. Physicians can only treat the
complications, said Reyes.

The disease affects children as young as 6 months old to 15-23 months
of age. The symptoms may include prodromal fever, conjunctivitis,
coryza, cough and Koplik spots.

Reyes explained that measles vaccination may be given as early as 6
months old. The presence of maternal antibodies to 6 months old and
below will neutralize the effect of the vaccine. It is not
administered at 5 months of age or below. The vaccine efficacy depends
on the child's age. "Even high immunization coverage will not prevent
outbreaks."

The vaccination should also be repeated at 9 months old. Vaccination
given at 6 months old is considered to be a "bonus vaccination," and
the vaccination at 9 months old is considered "primary vaccination."

In yesterday's [10 Nov 2009] press conference, Reyes attributed the
resurgence of measles cases in Western Visayas to the "accumulation of
susceptibles." The poor vaccination coverage contributes to the
recurrence of the disease.

From 2005 until 2007, there were no confirmed measles cases in
Western Visayas. In 2007, the government launched a mass immunization
program to prevent its resurgence. The Knock-out Tigdas [measles]
program (see comment below) was purposely designed to anticipate the
resurgence of the disease, said Reyes.

With the increasing measles cases in the region, the health department
is pushing for the active participation of the local government units
in the measles elimination campaign. The health department strongly
recommends strategies that will help in the campaign. One of those
actions recommended is for the barangay [district] health workers to
visit the barangays, especially in far-flung regions, to inform
residents about the government health campaign against measles, said
Reyes.

The measles vaccination is given without cost to recipients in the
different health centers. Vitamin A is also provided to complement the
vaccination, said Reyes.

[In 1998, the Philippines adopted a 10-year plan to eliminate measles.
The strategies to achieve this goal were based on the Pan American
Health Organization proposal for measles elimination, which are the
following: 1) an initial catch-up mass immunization intervention
targeting all children aged 9 months to 14 years and improved
surveillance including laboratory confirmation of suspect measles
cases; 2) at an appropriate interval after the catch-up campaign, a
"follow-up" campaign targeting usually children 9 to 59 months of age
every 4-5 years depending on the measles coverage and epidemiological
data; 3) progressively improved routine immunization coverage that
should be kept high through a keep-up strategy.

The Catch-Up Mass Immunization started in September 1998. The target
population was the estimated 27 million children aged 9 months up to
14 years of age. Official reported coverage was 96 percent. Reported
coverage in each one of the 16 regions of the country was equally
high. Immediately following the campaign, efforts to improve measles
surveillance were undertaken, and laboratory-based case classification
started with improved case investigation forms. Sustaining high
routine immunization (fully immunized children or FIC) coverage (keep
up strategy) proved to be a challenge. Several factors were cited for
declining FIC, but the major cause was the erratic supply of vaccines.
Several outbreaks occurred, especially in areas with low routine
measles immunization coverage. Supplemental door-to-door immunization
activities were done from 25 Jun to 5 Jul 2002 among 9-59 month-old
children, particularly in the selected high risk areas of the National
Capital Region, Lubao, Pampanga in Region 3 and Antipolo City in
Region 4 using the door-to-door strategy. The coverage was 98 percent
or a total of 495 195 children 9-59 months old.

A "follow-up" Campaign in February 2004, widely acknowledged as
successful, reported that 17.2 million (94 percent) 9-month to below
8-year-old children were given a dose of anti-measles vaccines
nationwide. Validation of the reported coverage through grab sampling
and house-to-house interviews revealed 95.9 percent and 95.8 percent
coverage, respectively. Following the campaign, measles cases and
deaths decreased by 96 percent and 99 percent, respectively. After 2
years without a positive measles case, multiple measles outbreaks were
reported in certain areas of the Philippines. Failure of the routine
program to reach every child has resulted in accumulation of an
estimated 2.5 million susceptible children since 2004. Without
decisive action, this may result in a nationwide outbreak of a
magnitude the country has never seen.

"Knock-out Tigdas 2007 [Knock-out Measles 2007]" is a sequel to the
1998 and 2004 "Ligtas Tigdas" mass measles immunization campaign. All
children 9 months to 48 months old (born 1 Oct 2003-1 Jan 2007) should
be vaccinated against measles from 15 Oct-15 Nov 2007 door-to-door.
All health centers, barangay health stations, hospitals and other
temporary immunization sites, such as basketball courts, town plazas
and other identified public places, will also offer free vaccination
services during the campaign period.
