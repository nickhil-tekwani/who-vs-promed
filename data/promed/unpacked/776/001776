The outbreaks of anthrax in hippos in most African ecosystems appear to be
density-related. Excessive densities may be relative (when resources are
scarce, as in drought) or absolute, following optimal climatic conditions
when resources are abundant, and reproductive success and recruitment are
high. Excessive densities frequently result in resource depletion,
increased competition, and intra-specific aggression and conflict. Hippos
can be extremely aggressive, and fights frequently leave the combatants
with numerous lacerations, and may be fatal.
Hippo cannibalism has occasionally been reported from different parts of
Africa but is rare and appears to be triggered by stress-induced
"displaced" behavior, or possible nutritional deficiencies or needs. Hippos
have a well developed (partially fermenting) foregut, but they are not
ruminants. They also have a very well developed (fermenting) hindgut
(similar to rhinos and elephants), hardly the digestive anatomy that one
would expect in an evolved omnivore.
With regards to anthrax infection of hippos, I believe that there are
multiple mechanisms and routes involved, namely:
1) Contamination of grazing, generally as a result of an infected animal
[carcass] leaking infected blood from its orifices onto the pasture.
2) Ingestion of contaminated water, particularly in small stagnant pools
that are drying up during dry periods. In this situation, the infection
appears to be related to stress, stagnation (no diluting or flushing of
spores), and relative overpopulation. Most outbreaks of anthrax in Africa
occur during the dry season or dry cycles.
3) Open wound lacerations resulting in per-cutaneous infections. This route
of infection may possibly even occur in larger expanses of water, where
there is a dilution factor, but is more likely to occur in smaller stagnant
pools that have become heavily contaminated.
4) Cannibalism with ingestion of tissues from an infected carcass.

[Some 10 years ago, there was a severe anthrax epidemic among park hippos
in eastern Zambia. This followed an explosion in their population from
around 2000 to over 6000, with resulting overgrazing, long treks to find
food, and crowded rivers, clearly very stressful, as Roy has mentioned. On
this informed comment from a very experienced African wildlife veterinarian
-- thank you, Roy -- I will be cutting this thread. - Mod.MHJ]
