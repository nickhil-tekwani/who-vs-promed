WHO delays destruction of smallpox virus
----------------------------------------
[The World Health Organization (WHO) announced on Fri 18 May 2007 that it
is postponing for at least 4 years] any decision on when to destroy the
world's last known stockpiles of smallpox [virus], a deadly virus
eradicated nearly 30 years go.
There is no treatment for the [viral disease] that killed millions of
people a year as recently as the 1960s and left many more blind and
scarred. In 1979, it became the 1st disease officially stamped out after a
worldwide vaccination campaign. The United States and Russia, however,
which hold the only known stockpiles of the virus in high-security
laboratories, have long resisted calls to destroy them in case smallpox is
found to exist elsewhere.
The 60th annual World Health Assembly, the top decision-making body of the
United Nations agency, reaffirmed a previous commitment to [destroy] the
remaining stockpiles, but agreed to postpone any decision on when this
should happen until its 2011 meeting. In 2010, the WHO secretariat will
carry out a review of all research undertaken and still planned, in order
that the "64th World Health Assembly may reach global consensus on the
timing of the destruction of existing variola [smallpox] virus stocks."
A previous 2002 deadline for destroying smallpox [virus] was delayed by WHO
until new vaccines or treatments for smallpox were found, after the United
States said it would keep stocks on hand to combat any re-emergence of the
disease. That decision was made in the wake of the "September 11" suicide
plane attacks on the United States, which stirred fears that deadly viruses
could fall into the hands of terrorist groups.
