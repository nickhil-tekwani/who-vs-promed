Malaria outbreak in southern Nepal
-----------------------------------------
There are patients with brain malaria in Dhanusha district in
southern Nepal, the Janakpur Zonal Hospital in the district said on
Sunday [11 Mar 2006].
According to a statement issued by the hospital, brain malaria is
more dangerous than common malaria. Patients with brain malaria
become unconscious just after having fever a few times. The General
Branch of Disease Control has provided 10 sets of disease diagnostic
equipment to the hospital after discovering brain malaria cases in
the district.
There are 700 patients with brain malaria in Nepal, and the number is
greater in Dhanusha, Jhapa and Kanchanpur districts than in other
parts of the country. In the primary stage of treatment, patients are
given an injection called "Kuinidin" when they are unconscious and
then given medicine after they become conscious, Chief of the
Hospital Lakhanlal Shah said.
The Nepali Epidemiology and Disease Control Division (EDCD) started
spraying against malaria and kala-azar in the high-risk Terai
districts in southern Nepal this year [2006] to check the mortality
rate. The spraying drive for malaria is expected to cover over 250
000 people, the EDCD said. Statistics show that 32 out of 2229
kala-azar patients in 2003 were reported as having died and 15 out of
1526 in 2004. The National Malaria Eradication Program was launched
in 1958 with the objective of eradicating the disease within a
limited period.

[Nepal has a population of 27.5 million (as of a 2005 estimate); it
is estimated that about 45 percent of this population live in the
Terai region. The statistics are uncertain, but about 10 000 cases of
malaria are reported annually, of which 90 percent are _Plasmodium
vivax_, which does not cause cerebral (brain) malaria. (Source: WHO:
<http://w3.whosea.org/en/Section10/Section21/Section340.htm>).
Almost all cases are reported from the Terai region from below 2000
meters altitude, and the season runs April to October, with peak
transmission from June through August. Cerebral malaria develops when
_Plasmodium falciparum_ malaria is not treated in time. This can be
due to delays by patients and doctors, or may be due to treatment
with drugs against which the parasite is resistant. Chloroquine
resistance has been reported from Nepal. Further information would be
appreciated. Map of Nepal population density:
