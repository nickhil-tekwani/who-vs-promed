Thurmond Lake toxin again threatens eagles
------------------------------------------
A bird-killing neurotoxin linked to the aquatic weed hydrilla
re-appeared this fall [2011] at Thurmond Lake, where at least one dead
eagle has been recovered in Lincoln County.

Avian vacuolar myelinopathy (AVM) is believed to be caused by an
unusual alga that grows on the dense mats of hydrilla that are popular
feeding sites for migrating waterfowl.

âWe have been doing some preliminary eagle and waterfowl survey work
and have seen fairly high numbers of both,â said Ken Boyd, a
conservation biologist with the Army Corps of Engineers. As winter
begins, observers have seen lesser scaup, teal, redheads, canvasback,
ruddy ducks, ringnecks and large numbers of coots.

Because coots feed heavily on hydrilla and are often eaten by bald
eagles, the small birds play a major role in AVM outbreaks that have
killed dozens of eagles at the reservoir since the invasive weed first
appeared there in the mid-1990s. University of Georgia scientists
studying the disease visited the lake recently to observe bird
activity and test captured birds for AVM. âWe have recovered a
number of sick coots during this period, and there are thousands in
the area all feeding on hydrilla,â Boyd said. âUnfortunately, with
the low lake levels, more hydrilla is exposed and available.â

The first confirmed eagle death this season [2011] occurred the day
before Thanksgiving [fourth Thursday of November]. A Georgia Wildlife
Resources Division official found the dead bird near Cherokee Boat
Ramp. The possible remains of a second dead eagle, a pile of
feathers, were found earlier this month at Bussey Point, where a
number of dead or dying eagles have been recovered in past years.
The disorder, which causes fatal lesions in the brains of infected
birds, does not affect mammals.

One option under study to control the problem involves introducing
grass-eating carp to the reservoir in hopes that the fish would
eliminate the hydrilla, which in turn would reduce the likelihood of
AVM outbreaks.

[Avian Vacuolar Myelinopathy (AVM) was first detected in 1994, when 29
bald eagles were found dead during the fall and winter at De Gray Lake
in southwestern Arkansas. The most consistent finding across species,
locations and years is a microscopic change or âlesionâ in the
brain and spinal cord of affected birds.

This disorder is diagnosed by microscopic examination of very fresh
brain tissue. It appears as open spaces in the white matter
(myelinated areas) of the central nervous system in affected birds.
Recent studies have implicated exotic hydrilla and associated
epiphytic cyanobacterial species as a link to AVM (Environ Toxicol 20:
348-353). Hydrilla is an aquatic plant invasive in the United States
following release in the 1960s from aquariums into waterways in
Florida. It is now established in the south & east from Connecticut to
Texas. Hydrilla can be controlled by the application of aquatic
herbicides and it is also eaten by grass carp, itself an invasive
species in North America. Portions of this comment were extracted from
