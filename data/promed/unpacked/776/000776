b. Assessing the severity of an influenza pandemic - 11 May 2009
<http://www.who.int/csr/disease/swineflu/assess/disease_swineflu_assess_20090511/en/index.html>

Assessing the severity of an influenza pandemic
-----------------------------------------------
The major determinant of the severity of an influenza pandemic, as measured
by the number of cases of severe illness and deaths it causes, is the
inherent virulence of the virus. However, many other factors influence the
overall severity of a pandemic's impact.

Even a pandemic virus that initially causes mild symptoms in otherwise
healthy people can be disruptive, especially under the conditions of
today's highly mobile and closely interdependent societies. Moreover, the
same virus that causes mild illness in one country can result in much
higher morbidity and mortality in another. In addition, the inherent
virulence of the virus can change over time as the pandemic goes through
subsequent waves of national and international spread.

Properties of the virus
-----------------------
An influenza pandemic is caused by a virus that is either entirely new or
has not circulated recently and widely in the human population. This
creates an almost universal vulnerability to infection. While not all
people ever become infected during a pandemic, nearly all people are
susceptible to infection.

The occurrence of large numbers of people falling ill at or around the same
time is one reason why pandemics are socially and economically disruptive,
with a potential to temporarily overburden health services.

The contagiousness of the virus also influences the severity of a
pandemic's impact, as it can increase the number of people falling ill and
needing care within a short time frame in a given geographical area. On the
positive side, not all parts of the world, or all parts of a country, are
affected at the same time.

The contagiousness of the virus will influence the speed of spread, both
within countries and internationally. This, too, can influence severity, as
very rapid spread can undermine the capacity of governments and health
services to cope.

Pandemics usually have a concentrated adverse impact in specific age
groups. Concentrated illnesses and deaths in a young, economically
productive age group will be more disruptive to societies and economies
than when the very young or very old are most severely affected, as seen
during epidemics of seasonal influenza.

Population vulnerability
------------------------
The overall vulnerability of the population can play a major role. For
example, people with underlying chronic conditions, such as cardiovascular
disease, hypertension, asthma, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, and several
others, are more likely to experience severe or lethal infections. The
prevalence of these conditions, combined with other factors such as
nutritional status, can influence the severity of a pandemic in a
significant way.

Subsequent waves of spread
--------------------------
The overall severity of a pandemic is further influenced by the tendency of
pandemics to encircle the globe in at least 2, sometimes 3, waves. For many
reasons, the severity of subsequent waves can differ dramatically in some
or even most countries.

A distinctive feature of influenza viruses is that mutations occur
frequently and unpredictably in the 8 gene segments, and especially in the
hemagglutinin gene. The emergence of an inherently more virulent virus
during the course of a pandemic can never be ruled out.

Different patterns of spread can also influence the severity of subsequent
waves. For example, if schoolchildren are mainly affected in the 1st wave,
the elderly can bear the brunt of illness during the 2nd wave, with higher
mortality seen because of the greater vulnerability of elderly people.

During the previous century, the 1918 pandemic began mild and returned,
within 6 months, in a much more lethal form. The pandemic that began in
1957 started mild, and returned in a somewhat more severe form, though
significantly less devastating than seen in 1918. The 1968 pandemic began
relatively mild, with sporadic cases prior to the 1st wave, and remained
mild in its 2nd wave in most, but not all, countries.

Capacity to respond
-------------------
Finally, the quality of health services influences the impact of any
pandemic. The same virus that causes only mild symptoms in countries with
strong health systems can be devastating in other countries where health
systems are weak, supplies of medicines, including antibiotics, are limited
or frequently interrupted, and hospitals are crowded, poorly equipped, and
understaffed.

Assessment of the current situation
-----------------------------------
To date, the following observations can be made, specifically about the
H1N1 virus, and more generally about the vulnerability of the world
population. Observations specific to H1N1 are preliminary, based on limited
data in only a few countries.

The H1N1 virus strain causing the current outbreaks is a new virus that has
not been seen previously in either humans or animals. Although firm
conclusions cannot be reached at present, scientists anticipate that
pre-existing immunity to the virus will be low or non-existent, or largely
confined to older population groups.

H1N1 appears to be more contagious than seasonal influenza. The secondary
attack rate of seasonal influenza ranges from 5 per cent to 15 per cent.
Current estimates of the secondary attack rate of H1N1 range from 22 per
cent to 33 per cent.

With the exception of the outbreak in Mexico, which is still not fully
understood, the H1N1 virus tends to cause very mild illness in otherwise
healthy people. Outside Mexico, nearly all cases of illness, and all
deaths, have been detected in people with underlying chronic conditions.

In the 2 largest and best documented outbreaks to date, in Mexico and the
United States of America, a younger age group has been affected than seen
during seasonal epidemics of influenza. Though cases have been confirmed in
all age groups, from infants to the elderly, the youth of patients with
severe or lethal infections is a striking feature of these early outbreaks.

In terms of population vulnerability, the tendency of the H1N1 virus to
cause more severe and lethal infections in people with underlying
conditions is of particular concern.

For several reasons, the prevalence of chronic diseases has risen
dramatically since 1968, when the last pandemic of the previous century
occurred. The geographical distribution of these diseases, once considered
the close companions of affluent societies, has likewise shifted
dramatically. Today, WHO estimates that 85 per cent of the burden of
chronic diseases is now concentrated in low- and middle-income countries.
In these countries, chronic diseases show an earlier average age of onset
than seen in more affluent parts of the world.

In these early days of the outbreaks, some scientists speculate that the
full clinical spectrum of disease caused by H1N1 will not become apparent
until the virus is more widespread. This, too, could alter the current
disease picture, which is overwhelmingly mild outside Mexico.

Apart from the intrinsic mutability of influenza viruses, other factors
could alter the severity of current disease patterns, though in completely
unknowable ways, if the virus continues to spread.

Scientists are concerned about possible changes that could take place as
the virus spreads to the southern hemisphere and encounters currently
circulating human viruses as the normal influenza season in that hemisphere
begins.

The fact that the H5N1 avian influenza virus is firmly established in
poultry in some parts of the world is another cause for concern. No one can
predict how the H5N1 virus will behave under the pressure of a pandemic. At
present, H5N1 is an animal virus that does not spread easily to humans and
only very rarely transmits directly from one person to another.

On 10 May 2009, Brazil, Colombia, and El Salvador each notified 2 new
confirmed cases of influenza A (H1N1).

Up to 11 May 2009, the total of confirmed cases of influenza A (H1N1)
recorded is 5029 including 61 deaths, in 10 countries of the Americas
(Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala,
Mexico, Panama, and the United States). This figure could be higher,
however, because some countries are still waiting for the laboratory
confirmation of samples collected in previous weeks.

To date, the United States has confirmed a total of 2600 human cases of
influenza A (H1N1) including 3 deaths, in 44 states including the District
of Columbia: 4 in Alabama, 182 in Arizona, 191 in California, 39 in
Colorado, 24 in Connecticut, 44 in Delaware, 54 in Florida, 3 in Georgia, 6
in Hawaii, 1 in Idaho, 487 in Illinois, 39 in Indiana, 43 in Iowa, 18 in
Kansas, 10 in Kentucky, 9 in Louisiana, 4 in Maine, 23 in Maryland, 88 in
Massachusetts, 130 in Michigan, 7 in Minnesota, 14 in Missouri, 13 in
Nebraska, 9 in Nevada, 4 in New Hampshire, 7 in New Jersey, 30 in New
Mexico, 190 in New York, 11 in North Carolina, 6 in Ohio, 14 in Oklahoma,
17 in Oregon, 10 in Pennsylvania, 7 in Rhode Island, 32 in South Carolina,
1 in South Dakota, 54 in Tennessee, 179 in Texas, 63 in Utah, 1 in Vermont,
16 in Virginia, 128 in Washington, 4 in Washington, DC and 384 in
Wisconsin. Other suspected cases are being investigated.

From [1 Mar 2009 to 10 May 2009], Mexico has reported 2059 confirmed cases
of influenza A (H1N1), including 56 deaths, in 30 of 32 states. The states
with the highest number of confirmed cases are Distrito Federal, Estado de
Mexico, San Luis Potosi and Hidalgo.

In Canada, to date 330 human cases of influenza A (H1N1) have been
confirmed, including a death, in 9 of 13 provinces: (52 in Alberta, 79 in
British Columbia, 2 in New Brunswick, 57 in Nova Scotia, 16 in Quebec, 1 in
Manitoba, 110 in Ontario, 3 in Prince Edward Island and 10 in Saskatchewan).

To date, Argentina has confirmed 1 human case of influenza A (H1N1);
Brazil, 8 cases; Colombia, 3 cases; Costa Rica, 8 cases including a death;
El Salvador, 4 cases, Guatemala, 1 case; and Panama, 15 cases.

Various countries of the region are reporting suspected and probable cases.
This indicates that surveillance enhancement is producing results.

A new virus emerges
-------------------
Novel influenza A (H1N1) is a new flu virus of swine origin that was 1st
detected in April 2009. The virus is infecting people and is spreading from
person-to-person and has sparked a growing outbreak of illness in the
United States with an increasing number of cases being reported
internationally as well.

CDC anticipates that there will be more cases, more hospitalizations and
more deaths associated with this new virus in the coming days and weeks
because the population has little to no immunity against it. Novel
influenza A (H1N1) activity is now being detected in 2 of CDC's routine
influenza surveillance systems as reported in the [8 May 2009] FluView [see
<http://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/>].

FluView is a weekly report that tracks US influenza activity through
multiple systems across 5 categories.

The 8 May 2009 FluView found that the number of people visiting their
doctors with influenza-like-illness is higher than expected in the US for
this time of year. Also, laboratory data shows that regular seasonal
influenza A (H1N1), (H3N2) and influenza B viruses are still circulating in
the US, but novel influenza A (H1N1) and "unsubtypable"* viruses now
account for a significant number of the viruses detected in the US.

It is thought that novel influenza A (H1N1) flu spreads in the same way
that regular seasonal influenza viruses spread; mainly through the coughs
and sneezes of people who are sick with the virus.

CDC continues to take aggressive action to respond to the outbreak. CDC's
response goals are to reduce the spread and severity of illness and to
provide information to help health care providers, public health officials
and the public address the challenges posed by this new public health threat.

[From Flu view Week 17:

[To summarize the current situation as of 11 May 2009, a total of 4694
cases and 53 deaths of influenza A (H1N1) infection have been officially
reported to WHO/PAHO coming from 30 countries, up from 4379 confirmed cases
and 49 deaths from 29 countries yesterday (10 May 2009). In the past 24
hours, Norway has confirmed the 1st case of H1N1 infection, and China has
confirmed the 1st case on the mainland.

The USA has officially reported 2600 laboratory confirmed cases from 44
states (compared with 2532 cases from 44 states on 10 May 2009) and 3
deaths (one in a Mexican child with pre-existing illness visiting in the
USA, a 2nd in a resident of Texas with known pre-existing illness, and a
3rd in Washington State with known pre-existing illness). Canada has
reported 330 cases from 9 provinces with one death in an individual with
pre-existing illness, up from 284 cases and one death reported from 9
provinces on 10 May 2009. Mexico has reported 2059 confirmed cases with 56
deaths (compared with 1624 cases and 48 deaths on 9 May 2009).

Age specific case fatality rates in Mexico continue to show high rates in
the 20-49 year old age group (4.9 per cent), the 50-59 year old age group
(6.6 per cent), and those aged 60 years and over (5.4 per cent).

According to influenza surveillance data in the USA, reported cases of all
types of influenza are high for this time of year, and while all strains of
seasonal influenza are still being isolated, the novel A(H1N1) and
unsubtypable represent 40 per cent of influenza viruses identified in week 17.
