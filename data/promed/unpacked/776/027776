A low-risk strain of bird flu has been found at a smallholding near St
Helens in Merseyside. [map at

- Mod.AS] A restriction zone has been placed around the area following the
positive tests for the disease.
Some of the infected chickens had been bought from the market held in
Chelford associated with the recent outbreak in north Wales. All the farm's
birds, including peacocks, have been culled. The strain is not thought to
pose a human risk. Low pathogenic avian influenza typically causes little
or no clinical symptoms in infected birds.
Fred Landeg, deputy chief veterinary officer said: "The tests were carried
out as part of the normal tracings activity, which is underway following
the outbreak in Wales. This is an extensive exercise, and this is the only
premises to date with evidence of infection."
The birds included 20 chickens, 3 ducks, 3 peacocks and some peacock chicks.
A restricted zone extends 1 km from the holding, which is thought to be in
Rainhill, near St Helens. People are forbidden from moving poultry or any
sort of live birds or eggs through this zone.
The 2 people who live on the smallholding have been tested for the disease
after exhibiting flu-like symptoms, but results came back negative. Animal
Health is tracing movements and contacts. Defra is working closely with the
Health Protection Agency on all potential human health aspects.

Tests have provided positive results for low pathogenic avian influenza in
poultry on a non-commercial smallholding near St Helens, Lancashire,
England. Birds at the holding were purchased on Mon 7 May [2007], from the
market held in Chelford associated with the recent outbreak of H7N2 low
pathogenic avian influenza in Conwy, North Wales.
Fred Landeg, deputy chief veterinary officer said, "The tests were carried
out as part of the normal tracings activity which is under way following
the outbreak in Wales. This is an extensive exercise, and this is the only
premises to date with evidence of infection."
A restricted zone has been put in place extending 1 km from the holding.
Animal Health is tracing movements and contacts, and all the birds at the
holding will be slaughtered. The necessary surveillance and all appropriate
worker protection measures have been put in place. Defra is working closely
with the Health Protection Agency on all potential human health aspects.

UK (England): Avian flu found at smallholding
---------------------------------------------
A restriction zone has been placed around the area following the positive
tests for the disease. Some of the infected chickens had been bought from a
market held in Chelford that was associated with a recent bird flu outbreak
in north Wales. All the farm's birds, including peacocks, have been culled.
The strain is not thought to pose a human risk. Low pathogenic avian
influenza typically causes little or no clinical symptoms in infected birds.
Fred Landeg, deputy chief veterinary officer for the Department for
Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) said: "The tests were carried
out as part of the normal tracings activity which is under way following
the outbreak in Wales. "This is an extensive exercise, and this is the only
premises to date with evidence of infection."
The birds included 20 chickens, 3 ducks, 3 peacocks, and some peacock
chicks. A restricted zone extends one km from the holding, which is thought
to be in Rainhill, near St Helens. People are forbidden from moving poultry
or any sort of live birds or eggs through this zone.
The 2 people who live on the smallholding have been testing for the disease

[This finding seems to provide supportive evidence for the Chelford-market
connection of the recent outbreak in Conwy, North Wales. - Mod.AS
The statement in "Avian influenza H7N2, human - UK (Wales) (08)" that the
outbreak of LPAI H7N2 disease in the UK was over has proved to be
premature, and will remain so until the source of the infection contracted
at Chelford market is identified. - Mod.CP]
