4 people affected with botulism in Buryatiya in the past week
-------------------------------------------------------------
4 new cases of botulism were reported in Buryatiya in the past week
[1st week of September 2004]. Since the beginning of this year
[2004], there have been 21 reported cases of botulism in Buryatiya,
and 2 of the people affected have died. So far, the intoxication has
been reported in Ulan-Ude and in the Kabanskiy rayons of Buryatiya.
Presently, one person with botulism is in critical condition in the
Kabanskiy rayon [district] hospital, while there are 5 people in less
severe condition in the Ulan Ude infectious disease hospital. The
cause of the toxicity is the consumption of smoked omul [fish].

[Omul is a type of fish in Buryatiya. It can be potentially dangerous
if smoked under home conditions. Home smoking does not eliminate the
bacteria, _Clostridium botulinium_, that produce the toxin botulin.
Botulism is not infectious and cannot be passed from person to
person. It is a toxin and must either be consumed (as in this case),
or the bacteria must infect a wound and then produce the toxin (wound
botulism).
Since eating smoked omul is a habit/ritual in Buryatiya, there are
several cases of botulism reported every year. - Mods.NR/TG]
