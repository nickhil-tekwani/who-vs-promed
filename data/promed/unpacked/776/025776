A local newspaper (La Nazione, page 15) today [31 May 2008] reports
that a producer of canned truffle sauce (Castello di Magrano Srl,
Carbonesca, Gubbio, Italy) has recalled lot No. 23 of "Salsa
tartufata bianca" produced on 3 May 2006 (best before end December
2009) [because of] the presence of botulism toxin. Apparently a man
suffered from typical botulism poisoning symptoms after ingestion of
this truffle sauce.

I am going to contact local authorities to get further information.
