[Three of the outbreaks are located in the middle of Belize but the
one in Orange Walk is located in the northern region of the country.
The outbreak in Orange Walk also appears to have occurred in mid June
(2010), about 6 weeks prior to the other 3 outbreaks. It appears that
at the time when Belize submitted this report to OIE, they had not
completed their vaccination campaigns in response to the outbreak,
because vaccination is listed as a measure that will be applied in
future.

According to the OIE WAHID database summaries, West Nile virus
infection has been reported from several countries in Central America
between 2008 and 2009. Costa Rica reported 3 outbreaks of West Nile
virus infection in 2009; Guatemala reported that the disease was
suspected but not confirmed in both 2008 and 2009; and Mexico
confirmed the disease existed there in 2009, but could not provide
quantitative data on the number of outbreaks.

Again, according to the OIE WAHID database, West Nile virus
infections have occurred in Caribbean countries and in North America.
In both 2008 and 2009, Cuba reported the presence of the disease but
without quantitative data. Guadeloupe reported confirmed infection
without clinical signs for a 12 month period from July 2008 into
2009. Haiti likewise reported the presence of the disease but no
clinical signs in both 2008 and 2009. The USA and Canada both
reported the disease in 2008 and 2009.

It is important to remember that West Nile virus emerged in the
Western Hemisphere in New York City in late August 1999, barely over
a decade ago. This resulted in human and equine infections with 62
cases of severe disease and 7 human deaths in New York City during
the 1st year. By 2003, West Nile had spread to most states in the USA
(Hawaii, Alaska, and Oregon being the exceptions) and Canada. West
Nile virus first appeared in the Cayman Islands and Florida Keys in
2001. Since then, it has spread steadily, year by year, so that now
it is considered endemic in the Central America and the Caribbean
regions. - Mod.PC]
