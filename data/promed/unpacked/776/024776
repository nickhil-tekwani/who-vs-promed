Five confirmed seropositive samples for dengue fever were reported by the
Ministry of Health today [24 Oct.1997, and further investigation is
underway. Two of the cases were from the Suva area (pop. 150,000), two
from Lautoka (pop. 80,000) and one from Lakeba island -- a 17 year old male
(pop. approx. 2000). Further investigation is underway. A press release
has already gone to the public, listing actions to be taken to avoid
mosquito bites. The Breteau index [measure of infestation by the vector
mosquito is high in some areas based on larval survey. Local authorities
have been notified, and breeding source reduction campaigns are underway by
local authorities and the Ministry of Health. Focal spraying around
schools and hospitals is also being considered in an attempt to limit the
spread of the disease.
