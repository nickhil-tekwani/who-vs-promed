Authorities have started a programme to vaccinate the entire cattle
population in the northern Indian state of Punjab after an outbreak of foot
and mouth disease, state animal husbandry department secretary R.N. Gupta
said Thursday.
The outbreak has already killed more than 140 cattle and movement of cattle
from the affected areas has been banned to stop the spread of the disease.
