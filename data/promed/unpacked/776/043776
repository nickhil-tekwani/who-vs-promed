Six people have been affected by anthrax after eating infected beef in a village of Tangail. Doctors are working hard to help the people recover from this disease.

Shahida Akter, a sanitary inspector of the city, reported that on 4 May 2013, one of the villager's cows was infected by disease, and then they slaughtered the cow. Those people who consumed the meat are affected by anthrax.

[Our previous report of anthrax in Bangladesh (20130517.1720541) had some 14 human cases in mid-May 2013, so this case near Tangail would appear to be part of the same series. Reporting in Bangladesh has its own priorities.
