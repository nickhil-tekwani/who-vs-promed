Two More Cases of Hantaviirus Pulmonary Syndrome Reported in Panama
-------------------------------------------------------------------
PANAMA CITY: The Panamanian Health Ministry announced on Thu 23 Nov 2000
that 2 new cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) were reported in
the Panamanian provinces of Los Santos and Cocle, in the country's
interior. The director of Panama's Gorgas Institute said that the first
case was detected in the community of Cocal de Las Tablas, Los Santos,
where a 30-year-old man was reportedly infected with the disease.
According to the Health Ministry, the patient, who is now out of danger,
did not suffer from a [pre-existing lung problem but [had contracted a
hantavirus infection. The second case was reported in Churube, district
of Ola, in the province of Cocle. The 40-year-old patient is also out of
danger, but remains in the intensive care unit of the Santo Tomas Hospital
of the capital.
Since the first case of hantavirus infection was reported in March [2000
at Los Santos, a total of 23 lung disease cases have been recorded, as well
as [including? 6 confirmed cases of hantavirus infection. A total of 5
deaths has been recorded as a consequence of hantavirus infection. The
Health Ministry recommended that precautionary hygiene measures be
observed, contact with rodents be avoided, and that crops be maintained a
minimum of 300 meters (980 feet) from homes.

[Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS), a severe respiratory disease with
high mortality, is caused by rodent-borne hantaviruses. It has previously
been identified in the United States and Canada as well as central and
southern South America. In late 1999 and early 2000, an outbreak of acute
illness compatible with HPS was reported in Los Santos, Panama, with the
death of 3 of the 12 (25 percent) suspected cases. Vincent MJ et al.
(Virology
2000 Nov 10;277(1):14-19) have now shown that hantavirus-specific
antibodies were present in patients' sera, and virus RNA was detected by
reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Sequence analysis of
virus genome N-, G1-, and G2-encoding fragments showed this to be a novel
hantavirus, Choclo virus. Serologic and virus genetic analyses of rodents
trapped in the area showed _Oligoryzomys fulvescens_ to be the likely
reservoir for the HPS-associated Choclo virus. In addition, _Zygodontomys
brevicauda_ rodents were shown to harbor another genetically unique
hantavirus, Calabazo virus. - Mod.CP
