Massachusetts
------------
State health officials confirmed the 2nd human case of Eastern Equine Encephalitis (EEE) virus infection in a female in her 60s who was exposed to EEE in Hampden County.

As a result, the EEE risk level in Wilbraham has been raised to critical, and the EEE risk level in Hampden and Monson has been raised to high.

Across the Commonwealth, 3 municipalities are at critical risk, 8 are at high risk, and 20 are at moderate risk for EEE.

All residents are reminded to use mosquito repellent any time they are outside, and those in high and critical risk communities are advised to schedule their outdoor activity to avoid the dusk to dawn hours to reduce exposure to the mosquitoes most likely to spread EEE.

EEE is a rare but potentially fatal disease that can affect people of all ages. There has already been one other human case identified this year [2020]. In 2019, there were 12 human cases of EEE in Massachusetts with 6 deaths.

Connecticut
-----------
In neighboring Connecticut, officials announced that mosquitoes trapped in Stonington on [5 Aug 2020] tested positive for EEE virus.

These results represent the 1st EEE positive mosquitoes identified in the state by the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station (CAES) this year [2020].

"The detection of EEE virus in mosquitoes in early August [2020] and the continued spread of West Nile virus is cause for concern," said Dr. Philip Armstrong, Medical Entomologist at the CAES. "Virus activity can quickly escalate so we'll continue to closely monitor mosquitoes for further virus amplification and spread."

"Now is the time to take precautions against mosquito bites," said Dr. Jason White, Director of the CAES. "We encourage everyone to take simple measures such as wearing mosquito repellent and covering bare skin, especially during dusk and dawn when mosquitoes are most active."

Last year [2019], Connecticut reported 4 confirmed human cases of EEE and 3 individuals died.

[EEE virus transmission is becoming more active in Massachusetts this year (2020). As noted earlier, the 1st human case of EEE appeared about 3 weeks after the virus was found in mosquitoes for the 1st time this year (2020). EEE virus has been detected in Plymouth (where the human case occurred) and Franklin Counties for the 1st time this year and for the 3rd time in Massachusetts, the Department of Public Health announced Wednesday (15 Jul 2020). Now, there is a human case in Hampen county, and this county and 2 others now have been placed on critical status. Last year (2019) was an unusually active year for EEEV transmission in the eastern USA, with cases in humans and horses, including in Massachusetts. As mentioned in many previous ProMED-mail posts, horse owners in eastern and upper midwestern USA states should vaccinate their animals now if they have not done so already. There is no commercially available vaccine for humans, so avoidance of mosquito bites is the only preventive measure to take.
