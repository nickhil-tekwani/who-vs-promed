On 21 Nov 2015, a 24-year-old male presented with high-grade fever with shaking chills, sweating and severe headache admitted to Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital (STIDH).

He had 1st developed severe pain in the right arm followed by severe joint pain in the upper limb. The next day, he gradually developed fever with rigors, for which he was taken to a nearby hospital. There were, however, no eschar, rash, or a history of conjunctiv[itis]. A platelet count was found to be decreased significantly (60 000/cumm) in the routine laboratory test. He was then referred to STIDH for accurate diagnosis and effective treatment. Serological tests for dengue fever, brucellosis, leptospirosis, and enteric fever were negative. ELISA tested positive for scrub typhus.

The patient was a resident of Gaidakot-10, Nawalparasi district of Lumbini Zone. Previously, Epidemiology and Disease Control Division (EDCD) had informed that scrub typhus cases were reported from Sankhuwasabha, Bhojpur, Siraha, Khotang, Dhading and Kailali districts. Later, it was reported in Kathmandu district. This report, hence, suggests that either scrub typhus might have been highly under-diagnosed, long before the sudden increase in the scrub typhus cases was 1st noticed, a couple of months ago, or may still continue to spread to other parts of the country.
