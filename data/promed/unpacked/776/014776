Our nation is now concerned over the deaths of 14 Orang Asli from the Bateq community in Kuala Koh, Kelantan. The real cause for the string of deaths must be quickly ascertained to prevent more from becoming victims.

Environmental groups are saying that water pollution is the cause. While water pollution is a very important factor, the effect should be gastroenteritis rather than pneumonia. Apparently, tuberculosis and leptospirosis have been ruled out, but has miliary tuberculosis been considered? It may present differently and is often missed, and it is very treatable if diagnosed early.

For example, they are the only race affected by a special form of ringworm (fungal) infection called tinea imbricata or Tokelau, which was first described in the aborigines of the Pacific island of Tokelau. Hence, the rarer form of tuberculosis, which affects people with poor nourishment, must also be considered.

Our Orang Asli are also slightly more prone to other infections like leprosy, which is caused by the bacterium _Mycobacterium leprae_, a close cousin of _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ [the cause of tuberculosis].

Orang Asli generally prefer to live in their own environment but let us continue to help them.

Unexplained deaths among the 300 strong Orang Asli villagers have caused widespread concern in Malaysia. Media reports claim 14 deaths and about 101 members of the "Orang Asli" (meaning the original people) village in Kelantan rainforest area of Malaysia, affected by a mysterious illness.

As of [12 Jun 2019], 4 of them were still in ICU and about 50 of them were admitted. Adults, children, and babies were among those admitted. 47 others received outpatient treatment. They were suffering from cough, fever, and breathing difficulties. Postmortem reports of 2 patients suggest the cause of death to be pneumonia.

Chemical causes for the pneumonia have been ruled out and laboratory testing is being done to identify any infectious aetiology. The bodies of those who died earlier are being exhumed for conducting postmortems.

According to the social media the villagers have been suffering from skin disease for a long time, suggesting the water source of the Orang Asli is contaminated, probably from a manganese mine in that area. The authorities have cordoned off the area during their investigations. Everything from infectious disease to pollution or poisoning from nearby mines has been suggested as the cause of this disease. As yet the reason for this outbreak remains unknown.

[ProMED-mail thanks the EpiCore member for responding to the request for information.

The reports above now say that about 1/3rd (100 individuals) of the Bateq community in a village in the Malaysian state of Kelantan have suffered from cough, fever, and breathing difficulties. The illness has been severe enough to cause hospitalization in about half of the ill and 14 have died (case fatality rate of 14%). Postmortem reports of 2 patients suggest the cause of death is pneumonia, but the etiologic agent has not as yet been identified. According to ProMED-mail post (Undiagnosed illness - Malaysia: fatalities, iron mining wastewater, TB susp, RFI 20190610.6511742), this outbreak started during the 1st week of May 2019 and it has affected all age groups. Tuberculosis (TB) has been suspected and the 1st report above raises the possibility of miliary or disseminated TB in an immunocompromised Bateq population.

A person with active pulmonary or laryngeal TB disease may have mild disease for many months, which can lead to delays in seeking care. Because a person with active TB may be contagious for prolonged periods of time before the disease is diagnosed and treated, a large number of their contacts may become infected (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/17/3/10-1550_article). It is estimated that people with contagious TB can infect 10-15 other people through close contact over the course of a year.

Contacts may become infected following exposure in poorly ventilated enclosed spaces, such as overcrowded households or other transmission sites ("hotspots") where contacts spend substantial time together with a contagious person. Transmission sites have included "drug houses", correctional facilities, homeless shelters, churches, workplaces, bars, and internet cafes). Most contacts who become infected develop latent TB infection (LTBI), which means they have been infected by TB bacteria but are not (yet) ill with the disease and cannot transmit the disease. People with LTBI have a 5-15% lifetime risk of falling ill with TB, with half of the risk occurring in the 1st 1-2 years after infection. However, persons with a compromised immune system, for example, by HIV-infection, have a much higher risk of falling ill; people with HIV/AIDS are 20 to 30 times more likely to develop active TB disease than people without HIV infection.

The risk of rapid progression is much greater among persons with HIV infection, because HIV impairs the host's ability to contain new TB infection. In several outbreak settings, 35-40% of HIV-infected patients exposed to TB in healthcare or residential settings developed active TB disease within 60-100 days of exposure (DiPerri G, Danzi MC, De Checchi G, et al. Nosocomial epidemic of active tuberculosis among HIV-infected patients. Lancet. 1989; 30; 2(8678-8679):1502-4; https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(89)92942-5/fulltext and Daley CL, Small PM, Schecter GF, et al. An outbreak of tuberculosis with accelerated progression among persons infected with the human immunodeficiency virus. An analysis using restriction-fragment-length polymorphisms. N Engl J Med. 1992; 326(4): 231-5; https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJM199201233260404). In the current outbreak of respiratory illness among the Bateq, a third of the village developed symptomatic illness within 4 weeks, a large proportion within a very short interval of time for TB, but perhaps not if all these contacts were close together and severely immunocompromised. We await more information from the investigating team on their findings.

The Bateq are part of the Orang Asli indigenous people of Peninsular Malaysia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batek_people). Orang Asli constitute only 0.5% (about 150 000 people) of the total population of Malaysia; the majority of Orang Asli live in rural areas in poverty, with a high infant mortality rate (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orang_Asli). Gua Musang is a town, district and parliamentary constituency in southern Kelantan, Malaysia. Kelantan, located in the northeastern corner of the peninsula is a state of Malaysia on the border with Thailand to the north (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelantan).
