An investigation has been launched after a dog died and 2 others suffered seizures following visits to a popular walking spot.

The Forestry Commission said at least 3 dogs were taken ill after visiting Poppy Wood Park in Melbourne, Derbyshire in recent days.

The site's parking area has been closed by park volunteers, who cannot guarantee it is "a safe environment."

A park-wide search for poisonous substances will now be carried out.

Alan Dowell, from the Forestry Commission, said: "Our local volunteers took the decision to close the car park because we were getting reports a dog had unfortunately died and a couple of others had suffered seizures which were out of character. We've not done any recent operations on site, so there's nothing on there relating to any form of fungicides or pesticides. We're going to be doing a walk-through on [Thu 30 Mar 2017] to see if anything has been inadvertently left on site, checking, particularly, the area of the stream."

Volunteers are planning a thorough search of the park.

A 3-year-old female dog fell ill within hours of visiting the park on [Sat 25 Mar 2017]. She was taken to an emergency vet but later died. Her owner said: "It looked like she'd had a seizure, with drool and stuff around her mouth, and her tongue hanging out. She couldn't move and was crying the whole time because she was in so much pain. The emergency vet said it looked like she had eaten something that poisoned her."

Reports of 2 other dogs having seizures after visiting Poppy Wood Park came to light when the woman posted on the site's Facebook page. Mr Dowell said the car park would remain closed until he was satisfied the park was safe.

Nearly 30 volunteers swept a Derbyshire park on Thursday [30 Mar 2017] morning in the search for poisonous substances which are thought to have killed 2 dogs.

Odd-looking mushrooms, tennis balls and countless bags of poo were found at Poppy Wood, in Melbourne, during the search, but nothing suspicious was discovered.

The Environment Agency took several water samples from a stream which runs through the popular beauty spot, and an officer from Derbyshire Police sealed anything unusual in evidence bags.

Paul Reeves, from the Environment Agency, said the water will be tested over the coming days for dangerous toxins, such as pesticides, heavy metals, and pollution. The results are likely to be released next week

[The one thing clear from these articles is that 2 dogs are dead, and there are number, at least 2 and maybe more, ill from their visits to the park. It appears that all the ill or deceased animals visited the park within the last few days.

From the picture of the park on the news page of article [1], it looks large and beautiful, large enough that a dog could ingest something before an owner could get to the dog if the dog were off leash.

The seizures immediately make me think of strychnine or metaldehyde, which could both be put into a maliciously-baited tasty treat. The vague description here even fits the clinical signs for a number of mushrooms. However, seizures, illness, and death are common to other toxins, and even toxic plants, so there are not enough clinical signs presented here for a reasonable diagnosis. Mushrooms are very short lived in many environments. They may be present for a day, occasionally 2 or 3 days, and can vanish as quickly as they appear.

If a necropsy were done on any of the deceased animals, then laboratory tests were hopefully done for a range of toxins, including pesticides.

Searchers looking for something in the park may not see mushrooms if they were either completely consumed or have vanished. Searchers may not see issues with the water, including toxins from an algae bloom. The algae may be gone, but the toxins can still be present.

Hopefully, the emergency room veterinarian was able to collect blood and tissues to be tested. If this is the case, ProMED will appreciate the sharing of any significant results. If the park searchers should find something out of the ordinary and have it analyzed, then we hope they will share the results as well.

It should be noted that this particular situation does not fit the profile of Alabama rot. Alabama rot is apparently a seasonal disease and can cause lesions on the skin and occasionally in the mouth that may look like bites or sores. The disease can lead to dogs developing kidney failure. Lesions are not mentioned regarding the dogs at the park. - Mod.TG
