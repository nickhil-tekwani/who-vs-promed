Argentina Will Not Carry out Mass Slaughter of Diseased Herds
----------------------------------------
Buenos Aires - The Argentine government said it would not use mass
slaughter to fight foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), adding it was developing
a plan allowing the nation to recover its certification as "free from
disease with vaccination."

National Food and Agriculture Health and Quality Service (SENASA) chief
Bernardo Cane said the mass slaughter of diseased livestock "is not the
formula to use at this time," even as he denied Brazil was demanding
Argentina use the "sanitary rifle" to restore bilateral confidence.

Brazil, along with other major beef markets such as the United States and
the European Union, closed its doors to Argentine meat products after
Argentina finally admitted in mid-March FMD was once again appearing in
the nation's herds.

"Mass slaughter is a strategy used very early on in the epidemic, just
as it was used several times between 1993 and 1994, but it cannot be used
at this time," Cane said.

The SENASA chief told Buenos Aires-based Radio America that Argentina could
regain its certification as a "nation free from FMD with vaccination"
within 4 years, adding it took the 1989-1999 government of President Carlos
Menem the same amount of time to gain the certification.
