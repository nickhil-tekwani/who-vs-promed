Cannabis sprayed with insecticides is suspected to have killed 52 sheep in high altitude pastures near Devgarh panchayat of Kullu district, Himachal Pradesh, India.

Mysterious death of 52 sheep and goats in high altitude pastures near Devgarh panchayat of Kullu district [Himachal Pradesh] is pointing at active charas [hashish] mafia in the region. Locals allege that charas mafia has cultivated cannabis in this remote area and sprayed it with pesticides to prevent crop from disease and keep it safe from animals.

Locals are shocked by the incident, as dozens of sheep and goats dying in high altitude pasture is something unusual, but no one has come forward to lodge a complaint. Police are now taking help of forensic experts to know the exact reason of the death.

Sheri Jot above Shirar village, notorious for cultivation of cannabis, is popular among locals. Three shepherds reported on Wednesday [20 Jun 2018] dozens of sheep had died of unknown reason. Many villagers have blamed pesticides and insecticides on cannabis plants, which are generally grazed by sheep and goats, for the death.

"Shepherds reveal cannabis has been cultivated in the area and sprayed with insecticides, which killed the animals. However, there is no clear evidence of their death and there is a possibility of sheep eating some poisonous grass. Police are now investigating the matter," said Devgarh panchayat up-pradhan Narottam Kumar.

Another villager also blamed poisonous cannabis for killing the sheep and goats. "We have heard that charas mafia has started spraying insecticides on cannabis plants to protect them from animals, especially sheep and goats which usually graze in the area. How is it possible that such a large number of animals die together? Some wild plants are poisonous, but they are rare and it is not possible that such a large number of sheep graze on them together. Neither did they die of disease," he said.

According to sources, 45 shepherd families with 1456 sheep and goats take them for grazing in remote Shari Jot area, which can be reached only after hours of trekking from Himri village. Like Parvati valley, the area above Shirar and Fojal is notorious for cannabis cultivation.

While animal husbandry department has collected grass from the area and viscera of dead sheep and sent it to Palampur for laboratory examination, police have collected samples for forensic examination. Investigation officer Tarun Kumar said, "The samples have been sent to Mandi for examination. We cannot say anything without lab report."

[Cannabis (marijuana) is not necessarily known to be toxic to sheep. That being said, any thing in excessive amounts can be toxic. In other words, the dose makes the poison. There is a case of alleged poisoning in sheep causing the ovine to appear to be psychopathic, but there is no scientific evidence of it.

The article does not tell us of any insecticides nor does it give it any clinical signs of the animals to try and determine what happened.

High altitude disease can kill animals. We do not know if this is the case here. Again there are no clinical signs listed in the article.

Perhaps we will know more when a necropsy is performed and there is some laboratory testing on the tissues of the animals. More information from knowledgeable sources would be greatly appreciated. - Mod.TG
