Because of the millions of exotics imported into the North America,
including pygmy hedgehogs, sugar gliders as well as reptiles, amphibians and
tropical fish, there is no way it is possible to inspect every shipment or
even a random sampling of every shipment for enteric pathogens such as
Salmonella. And there is no point either (see below).
The U.S. CDC. insofar as I am aware, urges the promulgation of appropriate
hand washing, hygienic and other measures such as voluntary banning of
contact between these animals and small children, pregnant women and those
with any disorders, disease or who are undergoing any medical treatment
results in immunodeficiency rather than banning such imports.
Although exotic strains of Salmonella may be imported from overseas, there
are also hundreds of strains, many of which once were "exotic" already
endemic in such animals in the U.S./Canada and, where reptiles, amphibians
and rodents are concerned they are so commonplace (causing no symptoms to
the carriers) they are considered part of their normal enteric flora.
Banning imports now may be like closing the proverbial barn door after the
horse has been stolen. Efforts would be better directed at promoting
hygienic practices and limiting contact between carrier pets and the
aforementioned subsets of the population.
Attempts to eliminate Salmonella from the gut of these animals often causes
the elimination of beneficial enteric flora, killing the animal or, even
worse, it results in the emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains making
treatment of humans that much more difficult.
