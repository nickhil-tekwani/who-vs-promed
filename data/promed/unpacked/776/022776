Cases of mumps have doubled, with almost 1700 cases diagnosed in the
last 3 months [of 2009] alone, official figures have found. The cases
are mostly among older teenagers and students in their early 20s, as
they were too old to have received the measles, mumps and rubella
vaccine or only received one of the 2 doses required for full
protection [against mumps virus infection].

In the last 3 months of 2008, there were 695 cases of mumps reported
compared with 1691 in the 1st 3 months of 2009. There were 2440 cases
in total in 2008, but this remains well below figures seen in the
last mumps epidemic in 2005, when there were 43 378.

Cases have been reported across England and Wales, with outbreaks in
universities and colleges. A report from the Health Protection Agency
said that only 12 per cent of cases are in people born after 1990,
when the 2-dose MMR schedule became universal, showing this approach
is working well.

Mumps virus is spread through saliva, and symptoms begin with a
headache and fever before the characteristic swelling of the glands
in the neck, but in 30 per cent of cases, there are no outward signs.
Complications can include swelling of the ovaries and testicles,
aseptic meningitis and deafness.

New cases of measles have dropped in the 1st 3 months of 2009, with
382 cases confirmed compared with 404 in the last 3 months of 2008.
Nine in 10 of these cases were in people aged 19 or younger, and, in
14 cases, the patient had received one dose of the MMR jab, and in 3
cases, they had received 2 doses. Dr Mary Ramsay, an immunisation
expert at the Health Protection Agency, said: "We would urge parents
to ensure their children are immunised against these infections. It's
good to see that recent MMR coverage is starting to improve, but we
cannot stress enough that measles is serious, and in some cases it
can be fatal. Delaying immunisation puts children at risk. It is
never too late to get your child immunised with the MMR vaccine.
Mumps is also on the increase but not because of the recent decline
in MMR uptake. The high numbers are mainly among older teenagers and
young adults in their early 20s, and mostly among those in further or
higher education establishments. Some in this age group were too old
to be routinely vaccinated with MMR when it was 1st introduced in
1988, and some others may only have received one dose of MMR. The
number of cases has increased more steeply in recent years because
many of the young adults in this cohort (born between 1981 and 1989)
are now at university or in further education colleges. This large
number of people in semi-closed institutions allows the disease to
pass more easily from one person to another. As the susceptible group
is quite large, we expect to see high numbers of cases to continue
over the next few years."

[These figures suggest that there is a case for offering
supplementary MMR vaccination to college entrants in their late teens
and early 20s who were too old to have received the MMR vaccine or
only received one of the 2 doses required for full protection against
mumps virus infection. - Mod.CP]
