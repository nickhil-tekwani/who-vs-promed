In the Podhrabina neighbourhood of the village of Chmelov in the Presov district, another outbreak of the avian flu (HPAI, the H5 sub-type) was confirmed; a 2nd confirmed case in a small private breeding farm producing eggs and meat for its own consumption, spokesperson of the Agriculture Ministry, Michal Feik, informed. The breed was placed behind the house, in a fenced place which was, however, not secured against wild birds.

The illness started on [Fri 6 Jan 2017], with diarrhea. The 1st death occurred on 8 Jan with 3 hens under 5 years of age. On [Tue 10 Jan 2017], 5 more birds died and the breeder reported this to the veterinary doctor who later informed the Regional Veterinary and Food Administration (RVPS) in Presov. A later inspection took samples on [Thu 12 Jan 2017]. Avian influenza of the H5 sub-type was confirmed on [Fri 13 Jan 2017].

Also, tests confirmed bird flu in the swans which died on a lake close to Dvory nad Zitavou in the Nové Zámky district in southern Slovakia, the SITA newswire wrote on [Mon 16 Jan 2017] [see 20170113.4764108. - Mod.AS].

The risk of bird flu stopped the selling exhibition of exotic birds, poultry, rabbits, pigeons and supply goods that was to take place on 22 Jan 2017 at the Agrokomplec fair ground in Nitra. The Regional Veterinary and Food Administration in Nitra has ordered a ban on all exhibitions, breeding meetings and selling exhibitions of birds, poultry and water birds based on the situation concerning the bird flu in Slovakia and in Europe. The head of the fair ground Agrokomplex Národné výstavisko, Mário Dinga, confirmed this to TASR [The News Agency of the Slovak Republic].

[This report informs the 2nd outbreak of HPAI H5N8 in poultry in Slovakia; the 1st one was recorded during the last week of Dec 2016 in Bratislava, on Slovakia's western frontier bordering Austria, affecting "backyard laying hens - pullets and adults up to 4 years of age" (see 20161230.4731666). The OIE report of the mentioned 1st event identified the causal agent as "Highly pathogenic avian influenza virus, serotype H5". Similarly, cases in wild fowl in Slovakia have been attributed to HPAI H5. A follow-up report, specifying the full serotyping results of the virus, including its Neuraminidase ("N") ingredient and adding epidemiological information on the 2nd event, may be expected soon.
