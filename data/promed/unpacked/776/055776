Outbreaks among humans:
- 1967 (publication year) Brazil. An outbreak at a Paulist seminary in
Braganza, Sao Paulo State.

[ProMED-mail thanks Steve Berger for this list of recorded outbreaks
in humans. Infection with _Toxoplasma gondii_ is not a notifiable
infection in most countries and published reports therefore most
probably represents a minority of the outbreaks. - Mod.EP]
