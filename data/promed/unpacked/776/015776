Those with an interest in cleft palates in bats in Queensland might like to
look at Pearn JH and Hegarty MP (1970) "Indospicine - the teratogenic
factor from _Indigofera spicata_ extract causing cleft palate." My
recollection of this article, now somewhat hazey, is that cattle (in
Queensland) eating this plant during a very narrow interval during
pregnancy gave birth to calves with cleft palates.

Indigofera spicata extract causing cleft palate. Br J Exp Pathol 51, 34-36.

["If" this is the answer to the bats' problem, the question would now be
how they obtained such a chemical or access to the key active parts. -
