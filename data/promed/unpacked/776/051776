This "outbreak" may represent a particularly high incidence winter for
invasive GAS infections in some parts of North America. The Ontario Group
A Streptococcal Study has performed population-based surveillance for all
invasive GAS infections (defined as those associated with a positive
culture of GAS from a sterile site) in Ontario (population 11M) since 1992.
There have been more invasive GAS cases in January and February, 1999 than
in any two month period since surveillance started. Our winter average has
been 44 cases per 2 month period; this year there have been 79 cases in
January and February (the previous high for a two month period was in
Jan/Feb 1995 when there were 57. The increase in the number of cases
associated with streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS) has been even
more striking: in Jan/Feb 1999 we have seen 21 cases, compared to a
two-month average of 8, and a previous two month high of 11. The number of
cases of necrotizing fasciitis has also increased.
In Ontario, the infections have been spread across the province, with no
marked clustering. The increase has been sufficient to be noticed by
several hospitals and health units. Typing of the strains by pulsed-field
gel electrophoresis (PFGE) (which correlates well with M typing) indicates
that the STSS cases are of a variety of strains. There are no type M3
isolates (the frequency of M3 isolates increased sharply in association
with the increase in cases we and others in North America saw in 1994/5).
Physicians treating these cases might wish consider using IVIG (polyclonal
intravenous immunoglobulin). There is considerable evidence that STSS is a
superantigen mediated disease, providing theoretical support for this
treatment. There are a number of case reports of its use, and our
"case-control" study of its use in STSS will be published in Clinical
Infectious Diseases in April this year. In our data, the use of IVIG was
associated with a reduction in 7 day mortality in STSS from 50% to 10%.
The dose we are currently recommending is 2 g/kg (very large volume) given
as a single dose as quickly as is feasible (usually 6-24 hours). There is
also some evidence that adding clindamycin (usually 600mg q8h) early on may
improve outcome. (It is also important to remember that a significant
fraction of cases - as many as half - were not eligible for our study
because they were dead on arrival, or died before a diagnosis of STSS was
entertained - this can be a very rapidly progressive disease with focal
symptoms until very late).
The Ontario Group A Streptococcal Study is continuing studies of
pathogenesis of this condition. We would be happy to hear from physicians
about individual cases, and to talk about management issues. We would also
be happy to have patients enrolled in our current study (in general, this
involves sending us isolates, clinical information, and three green top and
one red top tube collected as early as possible in illness, then repeated.)
You can get the Ontario Group A Streptococcal Study by emailing Don Low or
Allison McGeer (dlow@mtsinai.on.ca; amcgeer@mtsinai.on.ca), or calling the
office 416-586-4435 (after hours, locating is 416-586-5133; operators will
page us if they know it is a Group A _Streptococcus_ case).
