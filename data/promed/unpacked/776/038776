----------------------------------------------------------------------
Complementary clinical findings and follow-up of a patient with cutaneous melioidosis in Belgium after a visit to Thailand:

We report the detailed travel history and additional clinical findings of the patient with cutaneous melioidosis notified on 9 Oct 2012 (ProMED-mail posting 20121007.1329106). This 60-year-old Thai woman was referred to the post-travel clinic of the Institute of Tropical Medicine, Antwerp (Belgium), for further management and follow-up.

She has been living in Belgium since 1984 and visits Thailand every year. Her last visit to Thailand was in July and August 2012. She visited the mountains in Phetchabun, in Central North Thailand. There was rain, but not so much as compared with other years. During her visit to Udon Thani in Northeast Thailand in July 2012, she fell in a muddy field. In the following weeks, when still in Thailand, she developed a small painless lesion on the right lower leg. This wound became progressively larger over the following 6 weeks. She remained afebrile and without any other symptoms.

Culture of a wound swab, taken by her general practitioner on 3 Sep 2012, showed presence of _Burkholderia pseudomallei_. Upon consultation on 18 Sep 2012, physical examination was unremarkable, apart from an indurated indolent, non-suppurative skin ulcer (3 cm diameter) with a purple edge on her right lower leg. In her medical history we noted knee surgery and non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus for the past 4 years, for which she took gliclazide 80 mg daily and metformin 500 mg daily. She had been empirically treated by her general practitioner with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid 875/125 q8h for 7 days (8-14 Sep 2012), which had led to partial improvement.

In spite of this, a new wound swab taken on 18 Sep 2012 and cultured in a BSL-3 facility still yielded abundant growth of _B. pseudomallei_ (as confirmed by _B. pseudomallei_-specific latex agglutination, Mahidol-Oxford Tropical Medicine Research Unit, Bangkok, Thailand) with an identical [antimicrobial] susceptibility pattern as the 1st isolate, that is, susceptible to ceftazidime, imipenem, SMX-TMP (sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim), amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, and doxycycline and resistant to amikacin and polymyxins (as determined by disk diffusion and E-test macromethod, Biomerieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France).

Blood analysis revealed an increased HbA1c of 7.9 percent (normal value 4.8-6.0 percent); no signs of inflammation were noted. A chest X-ray and abdominal ultrasound were normal. As a treatment for cutaneous melioidosis, the patient was restarted on amoxicillin-clavulanic acid 875/125 mg q8h with additional SMX-TMP 800/160 mg q8h (dose adapted for her actual weight of 55 kg). Of note, the prescription of SMX-TMP proved unexpectedly challenging due to the temporary unavailability of the product in the Belgian pharmacies.

Upon follow-up consultation 2 weeks later (2 Oct 2012), the wound appeared clearly improved but not fully healed. The medication was correctly taken and well tolerated. A new wound swab yielded no more bacterial growth. A follow-up consultation is planned in 2 weeks.

[ProMED-mail thanks the authors for a more detailed description of this patient with cutaneous melioidosis.

The diagnosis of melioidosis usually relies on culture of the organism from clinical specimens. _Burkholderia pseudomallei_ is not difficult to isolate and will grow on a large variety of culture media; however, isolation of _B. pseudomallei_ is more difficult from non-sterile body sites because of overgrowth of other microorganisms (http://www.hpa.org.uk/Topics/InfectiousDiseases/InfectionsAZ/Melioidosis/GeneralInformation/melioLaboratorydiagnosisMelioidosis/). Because of the danger of laboratory-acquired melioidosis, this organism should be handled by trained personnel within a Biosafety Level 3 (BSL-3) facility when processing clinical isolates. However, workers in clinical diagnostic laboratories may be unwittingly exposed to _B. pseudomallei_, during isolation, identification, and antimicrobial susceptibility testing, before its identity is recognized (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc2600349/). Exposure to aerosols represents the greatest biohazard because it can result in inhalation, ingestion, and mucous membrane contact. Other high-risk exposure events include puncture wounds.

The recommended management for all forms of melioidosis consists of an intensive phase of intravenous antimicrobial agents (such as, ceftazidime or a carbapenem) for a minimum of 10-14 days, followed by a prolonged course (3 months or longer) of an oral antimicrobial agent (such as, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole) to prevent relapse (Cheng AC, Currie BJ: Melioidosis: Epidemiology, Pathophysiology, and Management. Clin Microbiol Rev 2005; 18(2): 383-416. Available at http://cmr.asm.org/content/18/2/383.full). Patients with localized primary skin melioidosis have been reported to do well with only oral antibiotics (Gibney KB, Cheng AC, Currie BJ: Cutaneous Melioidosis in the Tropical Top End of Australia: A Prospective Study and Review of the Literature. Clin Infect Dis 2008; 47(5): 603-9. Available at http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/47/5/603.full). However, some patients with seemingly isolated primary cutaneous melioidosis may actually have complicated or disseminated melioidosis upon thorough investigation that would require treatment with initial intravenous antibiotics as well as oral antibiotics subsequently (http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/18/2/11-1603_article.htm). Prolonged monitoring has been recommended because relapses occur despite well-conducted antimicrobial drug treatment (Meckenstock R, Therby A, Marque-Juillet S, et al: Cutaneous Melioidosis in Adolescent Returning from Guadeloupe. Feb 2012, Available at http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/18/2/11-1603_article.htm).
