Death came quickly, as is typical for this disease. A few weeks ago, on 8 May [2013] the 2 young men had been out with friends in Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg and visited a gay club. Two days later, both felt sick. One suffered from nausea, vomiting, and a stiff neck. A little later, he was admitted to the hospital and remains in a coma. The other went to work; in the evening, he met friends, but he felt worse. Two days later, he died in his apartment. A bacterium called _Neisseria meningitidis_ was isolated from both men.

Many people may carry these bacteria on the mucous membranes of nose and throat for months without becoming ill; the organism may then disappear. "20-30 per cent of young people in Germany may carry the pathogen," said Wiebke Hellenbrand, of the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). What distinguishes the healthy carrier from the sick, nobody knows.

How the 2 Berliners were infected is unclear. Meningococci are transmitted by droplet [aerosol or secretions from the nasopharynx of colonized persons]. Humans can be infected by kissing or coughing. "Maybe the 2 infected each other. Or maybe they were both infected by a 3rd party," said Ulrich Marcus of RKI. The exact route of the pathogen cannot be reconstructed but has led to investigations that have uncovered additional cases and a call to vaccinate some 80 000 men who have sex with men in Berlin.

Deaths caused by _N. meningitidis_ are not unusual. In Europe, the subgroups B and C are particularly responsible for causing illness, mostly in children and teenagers. In 2012, the Robert Koch Institute (RKI: the German national disease surveillance insitute) reported 300 ill, 33 of whom died.

"This case was really only noticed because these 2 men were diagnosed within 24 hours, and it was clear that they had spent the night together," said Hellenbrand. That sounds like an outbreak. Meningococcal infections tend to break out in places where people come together in a confined space: guests on a cruise ship, fans at a rugby game, kids at a carnival party.

And another thing made the RKI experts take notice: the 2 men were gay, or, as the RKI epidemiologists called them, MSM (men who have sex with men). Epidemiologists are concerned with behavior, not sexual orientation. MSM includes gays, as well as bisexuals and male prostitutes.

Actually, gays are not considered particularly vulnerable to meningococcal disease, which affects men and women, homo- and heterosexuals alike. But doctors in Toronto in 2001 described a small outbreak of meningococcal disease among MSM: six people developed the disease, and 2 of them died. This was followed by outbreaks in Chicago and Los Angeles. But doctors were really attentive only when an outbreak in New York City last year [2012] afflicted 22 gays, 7 of whom died.

And now Berlin: investigation revealed that a young gay man had come to the hospital in February [which year?] with meningococcal disease. He died 10 hours later in the operating room. Later in Berlin, 2 cases were yet to be identified, one died in October 2012, the other fell ill in February 2013 and survived.

Concerns have been expressed by the European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC). On 3 Jul 2013, ECDC experts published a brief risk assessment. They concluded that in big cities in Europe, there is an increased risk that gay men are infected with meningococcus and warned that huge gay festivals, such as the Christopher Street Day in Berlin, might contribute to the dissemination of the pathogen. Countries should, therefore, be particularly vigilant for meningococcal cases.

Why gays in particular? Don Weiss of the health department in New York, who experienced the outbreak in his own city, wonders whether the pathogen has changed and adapted to the group of MSM. Could meningococci be colonizing the urethra of gay men and be transmitted during oral sex? Or has the pathogen adapted to the anal mucosa? "We know that smoking is a risk factor, because it damages the lining of the airways and makes it easier for bacteria to enter the body," says White [Weiss?]. "The same could happen if the anal mucosa is irritated." Then, anal intercourse would be a risk factor.

Amanda Cohn of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta believes there is a simpler explanation: gays are a social group with close contacts and could, therefore, be affected like a school class. Many gay men have multiple sexual partners quickly, kiss in greeting, and go to crowded parties, which could magnify the problem. In one study, 43 per cent of gays carried the pathogen.

The question of whether a special strain of bacteria is circulating in the gay community must be examined in each case, says Ulrich Vogel from the National Reference Center for Meningococcal Disease at the University of Wurzburg. It would be possible to examine whether bacteria isolated from the Berlin patients grew better in intestinal mucosal cells or urethral cells than bacteria from other patients. Genetic sequencing of the Berlin strains is planned, and American and French researchers also want to sequence their samples. Perhaps a tiny change in the genetic material appears only in cases in MSM.

Marlen Suckau of the Berlin Impfbeirat [vaccination advisory board] had wide ranging discussions to decide whether the situation was disturbing enough for them to issue a recommendation for vaccination. In essence, vaccination would be recommended if a regional cluster were identified. For meningococcal disease, that means 10 cases per 100 000 people in one year. The group of MSM in Berlin is estimated at 80 000, and 5 cases in 10 months is significantly below the threshold. On the other hand, France had already issued a recommendation for vaccination and gays were vaccinated in New York and Chicago.

In the end, the Impfbeirat noted that the cases were all aged 20 to 29 years, says Suckau. In this age group, there are an estimated 18 000 MSM in Berlin. Thus, the threshold was exceeded in this group.

The recommendation is still valid for all MSM. "It's easier to communicate, and you cannot send away a 19 year old from a doctor's office," says Suckau. The recommendation was published in the Official Journal. On Sat 27 Jul 2013, it will come into force. For 6 months, gays will be eligible for vaccination in Berlin.

"This is a unique vaccine that is well tolerated," says Suckau, who wonders how high uptake will be. Germans have a hard time with vaccination -- for example, debating measles vaccination. Against the swine flu virus H1N1, only 5 per cent in Berlin were vaccinated, says Suckau. "So 20 per cent uptake for meningococcal vaccine would be a great success."

The Berlin Impfbeirat on 17 Jul 2013 has recommended an extension of public vaccination in Berlin, according to which men who have sex with men (MSM) should be vaccinated against meningococcal disease. The scheme is expected to start on 27 Jul 2013. The reason for the extended vaccination recommendation is an increased incidence of meningococcal disease among MSM in Berlin.

Of the total of 18 [cases of] meningococcal disease in Berlin in 2013, 7 were caused by group C _Neisseria meningitidis_. Of the latter, 3 patients died, and a 4th remains ill. These 4 patients are MSM and recent disease outbreaks among MSM have occurred in New York and Paris.

Meningococcal bacteria are found in the nasopharyngeal cavity in humans and can be transmitted by kissing, for example, or coughing. About 10 per cent of the population carry the bacteria without necessarily being ill. It is assumed that about 40 per cent of MSM are carriers of the bacteria and thus may be at higher risk of disease. The disease is taken very seriously, as it may be associated with serious complications and permanent damage. 2/3rds of affected patients suffer meningitis, and 1/3rd a life-threatening bloodstream infection (sepsis). In 10-20 per cent of cases, there are permanent sequelae. The mortality rate of group C meningococcal disease is as high as 10 per cent.

The only effective way to prevent meningococcal disease is vaccination. According to the recommendation of the Standing Committee on Vaccination at the Robert Koch Institute (STIKO), all children up to the age of 18 years should receive a single dose of vaccine against group C meningococcal infection. In adults, the STIKO recommends vaccination for certain people with immune deficiencies, such as those who are HIV positive, or for travelers to certain countries. The STIKO has not issued any recommendation for vaccination for MSM, but this gap is now closed due to the current events. The vaccine used for the current outbreak in MSM must contain a meningococcal group C component and be approved for adults. The vaccine is very well tolerated in general.

The recommendation for vaccination is planned to expire on 31 Jan 2014, and its effectiveness will be reviewed after this period. At the same time, the state of Berlin is committed to ensuring that the issues of vaccination for MSM by STIKO be uniform and thus cleared for other states.

[The following is extracted in part from moderator ML's comments in ProMED-mail post Meningitis, meningococcal - USA: (New York City) fatal, MSM, alert 20130308.1576590:

_Neisseria meningitidis_, the cause of invasive meningococcal disease (meningitis and sepsis), is transmitted from person to person via droplets of respiratory secretions, mostly from asymptomatic nasopharyngeal carriers of the microorganism. It is estimated that between 10 to 25 per cent of the population carry _N. meningitidis_ at any given time, and the carriage rate may be much higher in epidemic situations. Close and prolonged contact (such as kissing, sneezing, and coughing on someone), living in close quarters or dormitories (military recruits, students), sharing eating or drinking utensils, etc. facilitates the spread of the disease. The average incubation period for meningococcal meningitis is 4 days, ranging between 2 and 10 days (http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs141/en/). Invasive meningococcal disease carries a high mortality rate if untreated. Even with early and appropriate treatment, patients can die within 24-48 hours.

At least 13 serogroups, based on polysaccharide capsular antigens, have been described: 5 serogroups (A, B, C, Y, and W-135) most commonly cause human disease. Molecular epidemiology has revealed that most cases of invasive meningococcal disease are caused by only a few hypervirulent clonal lineages, whereas the genetic diversity is higher in meningococci recovered from healthy carriers (Claus H, Weinand H, Frosch M, Vogel U. Identification of the hypervirulent lineages of _Neisseria meningitidis_, the ST-8 and ST-11 complexes, by using monoclonal antibodies specific to NmeDI. J Clin Microbiol. 2003; 41(8): 3873-6; available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC179822/).

However, less virulent strains have been reported to cause invasive meningococcal disease in immunocompromised HIV infected patients (Ferreira de Andrade C, Cotrim da Cunha D, Cavalcanti V, de Filippis I. Fatal meningococcal meningitis in a HIV-infected patient caused by serogroup C _Neisseria meningitidis_ belonging to the non-hypervirulent clonal complex ST-60 (cc60). Braz J Infect Dis. 2011; 15(2): 178-80, available at http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/S1413-86702011000200017).

Since 2010, there have been 22 cases due to serogroup C in New York City among MSM (http://eziz.org/assets/docs/cdphmemo_2012_12_MeningitisAdvisoryMSM.pdf); this serogroup accounts for most US outbreaks (Woods CW, Rosenstein NE, Perkins BA. _Neisseria meningitidis_ outbreaks in the United States 1994-1997 (abstract). In: Proceedings of Annual Meeting of IDSA. 12-15 Nov 1998. Denver, Colorado. Alexandria (VA): Infectious Disease Society of America; 1998).

According to the 2nd news report above, there have been 18 cases in Berlin in 2013, 7 of which were due to serogroup C, but only 4 of the 18 cases were MSM, all of whom were infected with serogroup C organisms. The 3 deaths in Berlin were among MSM. Genotyping the Berlin and New York City serogroup C isolates would enable us to see if the same strain has spread to Europe.

We are not told whether any of the 4 infected MSM were co-infected with HIV and whether their CD4 counts were low. Severely immunosuppressed patients with HIV infection and a low CD4 cell count of less than or equal to 200/mm3 are likely to be at greater risk of developing invasive meningococcal disease (Domingo P, Suarez-Lozano I, Torres F, et al. Bacterial meningitis in HIV-1-infected patients in the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy. J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr. 2009; 51(5): 582-7; available at http://www.researchgate.net/publication/26279285_Bacterial_meningitis_in_HIV-1-infected_patients_in_the_era_of_highly_active_antiretroviral_therapy).

The primary method for preventing sporadic meningococcal disease is chemoprophylaxis with antibiotics, such as rifampin, ciprofloxacin, or ceftriaxone for persons who are known to be close contacts after a case is identified. Close contacts of patients are considered to be household members, day-care center contacts, and other persons directly exposed to the patient's oral secretions. Administering chemoprophylaxis to persons who are not close contacts of patients usually is not recommended. Neither oropharyngeal nor nasopharyngeal cultures for _N. meningitidis_ are useful for deciding who should receive chemoprophylaxis.

However, in the face of multiple anonymous sexual encounters among some MSM, a mass vaccination campaign is being used to control this outbreak as detailed in the news releases above. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) has released recommendations for the use of meningococcal vaccine to control outbreaks of serogroup C meningococcal disease (CDC. Control and prevention of serogroup C meningococcal disease: evaluation and management of suspected outbreaks: recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). MMWR Recomm Rep. 1997; 46(RR-5): 13-21; available at http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00046237.htm).

Berlin, located in north eastern Germany, with a population of 3.3 million people, is the capital of Germany and one of its 16 states; it is Germany's largest city and the 2nd most populous city in the European Union (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin). The city has a long history of gay culture and a large number of gay clubs and festivals (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin#Gay_life). - Mod.ML
