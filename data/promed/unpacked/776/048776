Avian influenza situation in Cambodia
-------------------------------------
On Wed 9 Feb 2011, the Ministry of Health of Cambodia announced a new
confirmed case of human infection with avian influenza A (H5N1)
virus.

The 5 year old girl, from Prek Leap village, Sangkat Prek Leap, Khan
Reussey Keo, Phnom Penh, developed symptoms on 29 Jan 2011, was
admitted to a hospital on 3 Feb 2011, and died 12 hours following
admission. The presence of H5N1 virus in nasopharyngeal specimens was
confirmed by the Institut Pasteur, the National Influenza Centre in
Cambodia. The case had been in contact with sick poultry during the 7
days before she developed symptoms.

The Ministry of Health has been coordinating the response. Actions
have included contact tracing, collecting specimens from suspected
cases, and providing oseltamivir prophylaxis to close contacts; active
surveillance and joint investigation with animal health authorities;
community education; and public communications coordination with the
assistance of WHO.

Of the 11 cases of human H5N1 virus infection confirmed since 2005 in
Cambodia, 9 have been fatal.
