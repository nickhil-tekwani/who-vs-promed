Early Season West Nile Virus Activity in the Negev
--------------------------------------------------
The first signs this year of West Nile [virus] have been found in mosquitos
in the Negev, the Environment Ministry said yesterday [Mon 13 May 2002]. A
routine check by inspectors from the ministry's division for pest
surveillance and control found infected mosquitos in the area of Wadi
Shikma, near Kibbutz Or Haner. The ministry says local authorities have
been told about the mosquitos and are taking action to spray where
mosquitos breed. Uri Shalom, head of division for pest surveillance and
control says that this is the earliest in the year that infected mosquitos
have been found. "Over the past 2 years, we usually detected infected
mosquitos around August. Dr. Yossi Anbar, a deputy director for
infrastructure at the Environment Ministry, says that due to the heavy rain
last winter and the recent late rains there is likely to be a wave of fever
problems caused by pools of stagnant water, a favorite breeding site for
mosquitos. "We had 600 millimeters of rain in the Negev this year, whereas
the average is 350 mm."

The Health Ministry is not concerned about the Environment Ministry's
discovery of West Nile virus in mosquitoes in the South, even though its
appearance comes a bit early in the season. Dr. Emilia Anis, deputy chief
epidemiologist at the Health Ministry, said yesterday that: "We are not
worried. We're working to prevent an outbreak this year. The Environment
Ministry has responsibility to ensure that the local authorities are
spraying pesticides to kill mosquitoes. We urge everyone to report to their
local authority or municipality if they have noticed a mosquito problem,
and it should be taken care of." She also advised checking near your home
for open water where larvae breed. Decorative pools should be stocked with
Gambusia fish, which feed on mosquito larvae.

West Nile fever is spread by infected mosquitos. The fever, which is not
contagious, can be fatal to those with a weakened immune system. Last year,
37 people fell ill with West Nile fever; 2 died. In 2001, there were 430
cases and 29 fatalities. People at risk for complications of West Nile
fever (the elderly and people with chronic diseases or weak immune systems)
should protect themselves during the mosquito season by covering themselves
up outdoors, installing screens, and using mosquito repellent.
