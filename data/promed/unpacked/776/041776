Laos: 1st suspected human case of avian influenza
-----------------------------------------------
The transmission of avian influenza to a human host is now suspected
for the 1st time in Laos, but more scientific research is being
conducted to confirm it as fact, the government announced on Sun 25
Feb 2007. Minister of Public Health, Dr Ponmek Dalalay, said at the
emergency press conference that the patient in question was a
15-year-old, where bird flu broke out 2 weeks ago.
"She went for treatment at Setthathirath hospital on 15 Feb 20075.
She was sick with a headache and pain in some parts of her body. She
also had a runny nose and cough. All of these things can indicate the
common cold," the minister said. Dr Ponmek added that her parents
sent her for treatment in a hospital in Thailand 's Nong Khai
province on 17 Feb 2007. Later, samples were sent to Bangkok for
testing. "This morning we received a letter showing initial research
from the Thai side. That the [virus] is an H5-type virus is clear,
but it is not yet clear whether it is H5N1 or not. We cannot yet say
whether she was infected with bird flu or not, as more detailed
scientific research is needed," the minister said. "Today, we sent
our doctors to collect a blood sample from the patient, who is now in
Thailand, to continue researching the matter. We will also cooperate
closely with the Thai side to observe the progress of her health."
The Director of Vientiane's Health Department, Dr Inlavan
Keobounphan, said the girl did not play with chickens. "We are
surveying her family members, in particular those who live with her
in close proximity," she said. Health teams have surveyed and
interviewed residents in more than 7800 households in 20 villages of
Xaysettha and Sisattanak districts, being areas identified as red and
yellow zones respectively, after the avian influenza outbreak was
detected on 16 Feb 2007. Doctors have recorded 150 cases of people
who have reported symptoms of illnesses such as colds and flu in the
surveyed areas, according to Director of the National Avian Influenza
Coordination office Dr Bounlay Phommasack. "We continued researching
11 of the 150 cases in more detail, as we suspected that these people
might have been infected with bird flu. We found that only 3 of them
were possibly infected with the virus. Finally, just one girl is
currently suspected to be infected with avian influenza," he said.
The government announced the strict implementation of a 5-fold
strategy to prevent bird flu and its transmission to humans in
cooperation with other countries and international organizations. "We
will continue to be on alert for bird flu outbreaks and will increase
the dissemination of information to the public to make sure people
understand the issue," Dr Ponmek said.
Head of the Secretariat of the National Infectious Disease Prevention
and Control Committee, who is also Minister and Head of the
Government Secretariat, Mr Cheuang Sombounkhane, urged all people, in
particular people in Vientiane , not to panic about the issue. "Our
government is setting up strict controls for bird flu, systematically
and transparently, by cooperating [with] other countries and
international organizations," he said. "We are confident in the
ability of our officials to fulfill our ultimate goal."
WHO Representative Dr Dong-il Ahn congratulated the Lao government on
the efforts made to take action very quickly and transparently. Laos
is surrounded by 4 countries that have suffered from avian influenza,
namely China, Cambodia, Viet Nam and Thailand. "We have to strengthen
all our efforts for the prevention of the human cases that may occur
if we do not take it seriously," Dr Dong-il Ahn said. "We may have to
change our methods to include actual surveillance of the hospital
system, conducting a hospital health survey. This system has already
been tested by the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Agriculture
and Forestry." He added that the Lao government has actually been
successful in terms of improving their capacity and adopting new
health surveillance techniques. He said that, so far, around 174
human cases have been recorded over the last 3 years, mainly in
Indonesia and other Asian countries.
Bird flu 1st broke out in Laos in January 2004 on 45 farms around
Vientiane, and in the provinces of Savannakhet and Champassak. The
outbreak was suppressed with the slaughter of 155 000 chickens. In
July 2006, bird flu broke out again in Dong Bang, Nasala and Nontae
villages, in Xaythany district in Vientiane, where authorities
slaughtered around 20 000 poultry.

[During the past several days, there have been reports of suspected
human cases of avian influenza from Indonesia, the Philippines,
Russia, Turkey and the UK, but none have been confirmed. Although
there have been recent outbreaks of poultry disease in Laos as
recently as mid-2006, it seems unlikely that this single human will
be confirmed positive, as there appears to have been no contact
between the patient and poultry. Further information is awaited.
