Health chiefs have issued a food safety warning after recording "a higher than usual number" of cases of a potentially deadly strain of _E. coli_. NHS [Scottish National Health Service] Tayside has launched an investigation into a spike in the bacterial infection which is contracted by eating undercooked or contaminated meat.

A statement from the health board said: "NHS Tayside has been notified of a higher than usual number of people who have become ill recently with _E. coli_ O157 infection. Although the total number of cases remains small, we are investigating this in line with normal procedures, as we would for all cases of _E. coli_ O157."

Doctors warned that summer barbecues posed a particular risk because of the close proximity of cooked and uncooked meat and the chance of cross-contamination. They warned cooks to ensure their hands are washed thoroughly after handling raw meat and to cook food throughout. The statement advised: "Wash your hands before preparing any food and especially between handling raw and cooked meat. Raw and cooked foods should be kept apart at all times to avoid cross-contamination of bacteria from raw meat. Don't allow cooked food to make contact with hands, chopping boards, knives or tongs which have touched raw food.

"Always ensure that meat is cooked throughout, none of the meat is pink and the juices run clear. This is especially important for chicken, burgers, sausages and kebabs. If barbecuing, food should be kept in the fridge or cool bag until they are ready to go on the barbecue, and serving bowls should always be covered to protect from dirt and insects.

"If you're barbecuing for lots of people, you could cook meat indoors and finish it off on the barbecue to add that summer barbecue flavour. When you reheat food on the barbecue, make sure it's piping hot all the way through before serving."
