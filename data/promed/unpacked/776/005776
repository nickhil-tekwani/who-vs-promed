[According to OIE's WAHID database, China reported 10 foot and mouth
disease (FMD) outbreaks in 2005, 17 in 2006, 8 in 2007 and 3 in 2008.
This is the 1st report in 2009. Xinjiang province, in far
northwestern China, where this outbreak occurred had reported 4
previous outbreaks since 2005, with the last being in February of
2008.

A couple of items are hard to understand in this report. The most
perplexing is that the epidemiological is given as "Not applicable."
Yet, there seems to be a definite and substantial number of
susceptible cattle, 1408 and cases of FMD, 321. Be able to count
definitively in such a manner indicates that the population is
defined but yet the epidemiologic unit is not a farm. A clarification
would be appreciated. A 2nd anomaly is that dipping/spraying are
listed as a control measure to be used in the future, yet this is not
a known control measure for FMD.

The location of the outbreak can be seen in the OIE WAHID Alert
message posted above. - Mod.PC]
