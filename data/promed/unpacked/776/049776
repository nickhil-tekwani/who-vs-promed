First record of _Tomato spotted wilt virus_ in Jordan
-----------------------------------------------------
In Jordan, tomatoes showing necrotic and chlorotic ring patterns were
observed in many vegetable markets in 2003. In 2004 and 2005, severe
disease symptoms resembling those of _Tomato spotted wilt virus_
(genus _Tospovirus_, TSWV - EPPO A2 List) were observed in tomato
fields in the Jordan Valley. Molecular tests (RT-PCR, IC-RT-PCR,
sequencing) confirmed the presence of TSWV. This is the 1st report of
TSWV in Jordan.

First record of _Tomato infectious chlorosis virus_ in Jordan
--------------------------------------------------------------
In Jordan, symptoms resembling those of _Tomato infectious chlorosis
virus_ (genus _Begomovirus_, TICV - EPPO A2 List) were observed in
2004 on tomato plants grown under greenhouses in the Jordan Valley.
Molecular tests (RT-PCR, sequencing) confirmed the presence of TICV.
The virus was also detected in weeds (_Chenopodium album_ and _C.
murale_). The incidence of TICV was studied in 4 regions of the
Jordan Valley. In all surveyed areas, disease incidence was high and
ranged from 74 to 100 percent. This is the 1st record of TICV in Jordan.

[_Tomato spotted wilt virus_ (TSWV; type species of genus
_Tospovirus_) has one of the broadest host ranges among plant viruses
and has had a serious impact on many crop species worldwide causing
up to 100 percent yield loss in some instances. On tomato, it affects
both leaves and fruit causing spotting and necrosis. It is one of the
few plant viruses with a host range that includes dicots and
monocots. Weed species can serve as pathogen reservoirs.
TSWV is transmitted by various species of thrips, including the
western flower thrips (_Frankliniella occidentalis_), the onion
thrips (_Thrips tabaci_), and the chilli thrips (_Scirtothrips
dorsalis_). The insects retain the ability to transmit the virus for
life. TSWV is not seed transmitted but transmission by mechanical
means has been reported. Disease management includes vector control,
clean planting material, and phytosanitary measures. Natural
resistance appears to be rare amongst tospovirus hosts. For more
information on tospoviruses see ProMED-mail post 20070524.1670.
_Tomato infectious chlorosis virus_ (TICV, genus _Crinivirus_) is
transmitted by the whitefly vector _Trialeurodes vaporariorum_.
Insects remain infectious for 2-3 days after virus acquisition. It
has been reported from southern Europe and a few locations in North
America and Asia. Besides tomato, TICV can also affect artichoke,
potato, lettuce, and several weed and ornamental species. Symptoms
include interveinal leaf yellowing and necrosis. They may be confused
with nutritional problems and are also similar to those of _Tomato
chlorosis virus_, a related species in the same genus (see recent
ProMED-mail post 20071215.4030).
TICV has been reported to cause serious yield losses in both
glasshouse and field tomato crops. Since the insect vector is
widespread, long distance spread of the virus occurs mainly with
infected plant material. Disease management of whitefly transmitted
viruses is difficult and includes vector control, removal of
reservoirs of both virus and vectors, use of crop varieties with
increased pathogen tolerance, and clean planting material.
