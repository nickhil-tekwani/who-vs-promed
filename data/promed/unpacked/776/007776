Black rot in lettuce: a new disease caused by _Ceratocystis fimbriata_ in
hydroponic culture in Brazil
-----------------------------------

Accepted for publication 14 Jul 2005.
_Ceratocystis fimbriata_ is a pathogen reported on 31 plant host species
representing 14 families. In April 2004, a large hydroponic lettuce
greenhouse reported serious losses due to root rot. The Plant Pathology
Laboratory of Embrapa Roraima, Brazil, received samples of _Lactuca sativa_
cv. 'Vera' exhibiting black rot symptoms on roots and hypocotyl. White
mycelial growth and partly embedded perithecia was observed on the diseased
tissue.
A fungus was isolated as greenish colonies on potato dextrose agar (PDA).
Perithecia were dark brown, base globose, 140-210 micrometers, ornamented
with brown hyphal hairs; neck erect, 650-890 micrometers, ornamented with
divergent ostiolar hyphae; width at the base was 23-33 micrometers and at
the apex, 15-18 micrometers. Hyaline acospores were hat shaped, 7.3-7.8 x
2.6-4.7 micrometers, surrounded by a gelatinous sheath. The anamorph
corresponded to _Chalara_. These characteristics permitted the
identification of the fungus as _Ceratocystis fimbriata_ [Cf].
Pathogenicity tests were carried out on wounded and unwounded 35 day old
lettuce plants cv. "Baba de verao". A 40 microliter aliquot of the conidial
suspension (80 000 conidia per ml) or ascospore suspension (2 masses from
the top of perithecial necks in 40 microliters sterile water) was deposited
on the axil of the bottom leaf. Wounding was done by puncturing the leaf
axil with a needle tip through the inoculum droplet. Each treatment
consisted of 6 plants; there was also a sterile water control. The plants
were kept in a humidity chamber for 24 hours after inoculation and then
maintained under greenhouse conditions.
Black rot symptoms were observed after 4 days on wounded plants inoculated
with conidia or ascospores. Cf was recovered from lesions. No symptoms were
observed on unwounded inoculated plants or on controls.
To our knowledge, this is the 1st report of Cf causing disease in lettuce
or any other member of the _Asteraceae_.

[This report appears to be the 1st instance of Cf being reported infecting
an agricultural crop. _Ceratocystis fimbriata_ was 1st detected in Place,
VIC, Australia in 1987 on _Syngonium_ sp. It has been reported on White
Butterfly, White Knight, White Wings; as being well established in eastern
States when 1st detected; common overseas; with taro importation
intercepted in quarantine. It was introduced with _Syngonium_ sp., possibly
in tissue cultures, with taro tubers from Fiji. Other diseases include
black rot (sweet potato and _Araceae_), _Ficus_ wilt, mango wilt, coffee
wilt and canker, xylem stain and canker (Bitternut hickory), and in
Sycamore (California, North Carolina and Wisconsin).
