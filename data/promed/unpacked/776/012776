Viet Nam: 2 More Human Deaths Linked to Avian Influenza
-------------------------------------------------
The local Tuoi Tre newspaper on Friday [29 Jul 2005] reported 2 new human
deaths linked to avian influenza in south Viet Nam since 25 Jul 2005.
Initial test results from the Ho Chi Minh City Pasteur Institute confirmed
that the victims' sample tests were positive for the H5 avian influenza strain.
A man aged 24 from the Mekong Delta province of Tra Vinh was infected with
the H5N1 serotype avian influenza virus. Relatives said he and his family
had eaten dead chicken.
A 26-year-old from Ho Chi Minh city's Binh Tan district, was infected with
H5 avian influenza virus, the Pasteur Institute said. He [she?] had also
eaten chicken, according to his [her?] family.
The virus has killed 40 people in the country, half of whom have died since
December 2004. The H5N1 virus has also killed 12 Thais, 4 Cambodians, and
3 Indonesians since it first swept across much of Asia in late 2003.
On Friday, the Hanoi Animal Health Department also reported bird flu
recurrence at a farm in Long Bien district. Department officials culled
1500 ducks, disinfected the site, and sent samples to a test center.
Viet Nam will use more than 415 million batches of vaccine to inoculate its
chickens and ducks against the deadly bird flu in a program starting in 2
provinces from Mon 1 Aug 2005, an agriculture official said recently.
