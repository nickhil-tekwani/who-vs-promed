Russia has registered the 1st case of a strain of bird flu virus named A(H5N8) being passed to humans from birds and has reported the matter to the World Health Organization (WHO), Anna Popova, head of consumer health watchdog Rospotrebnadzor, said on Saturday [20 Feb 2021].

Outbreaks of the H5N8 strain have been reported in Russia, Europe, China, the Middle East, and North Africa in recent months but so far only in poultry. Other strains -- H5N1, H7N9 and H9N2 -- have been known here to spread to humans.

Russia reported the case of human infection to the WHO "several days ago, just as we became absolutely certain of our results," Popova said on Rossiya 24 state TV. There was no sign yet of transmission between humans, she added.

Seven workers at a poultry plant in Russia's south had been infected with the H5N8 strain in an outbreak at the plant in December [2020], Popova said, adding that the individuals involved felt fine now. "This situation did not develop further," she said.

In an email, WHO's European arm said it had been notified by Russia about a case of human infection with H5N8 and acknowledged that this would, if confirmed, be the 1st time the strain had infected people.

"Preliminary information indicates that the reported cases were workers exposed to bird flocks," the email said. "They were asymptomatic, and no onward human-to-human transmission was reported. We are in discussion with national authorities to gather more information and assess the public health impact of this event," the email added.

The majority of human bird flu infections have been associated with direct contact with infected live or dead poultry, though properly cooked food is considered to be safe.

Bird flu outbreaks often prompt poultry plants to kill their birds to prevent the virus from spreading and to avoid importing countries having to impose trade restrictions.

The vast majority of cases are spread by migrating wild birds, so producing countries tend to keep their poultry indoors or protected from contact with wildlife.

Siberia's Vector Institute said on Sat 20 Feb 2021 that it would start developing human tests and a vaccine against H5N8, RIA news agency reported.

Russia has reported the 1st case of a bird flu strain, H5N8, being passed from poultry to humans.

Officials said 7 workers at a poultry plant in the south of the country had been infected following an outbreak there in December 2020.

"All 7 people are now feeling well," said the head of Russia's consumer health watchdog, Anna Popova. She said that adequate measures had been quickly taken to stop the spread of infection.

There was no sign of transmission between humans, Ms Popova said, adding that the case had been reported to the World Health Organization.

She praised "the important scientific discovery" by Russia's Vektor laboratory, which had isolated the strain's genetic material from the infected workers.

"The discovery of these mutations when the virus has not still acquired an ability to transmit from human to human gives us all, the entire world, time to prepare for possible mutations and react in an adequate and timely fashion," Ms Popova said.

She said Russian scientists could now start working on developing test systems.

Other strains of bird flu occasionally infect humans and have led to deaths, but this is the 1st report of the H5N8 strain being passed on.

[Avian influenza or "bird flu" is a disease of birds caused by type A strains of the influenza virus. It can affect all species of birds, some other animals (e.g., cats, horses) and can very rarely infect humans. Only virus types H5 and H7 are known to cause the highly pathogenic (HPAI) form of the disease. The most well-known examples are the avian influenza subtype H5N1 viruses currently circulating in poultry in parts of Asia and northeast Africa, which have caused human disease and deaths since 1997. Other avian influenza subtypes, including H7N9 and H9N2, have also infected people. Some of these infections have been very severe, and some have resulted in deaths, but many infections have been mild or even without symptoms in humans.

H5N8 is a subtype of the influenza A virus, which is highly lethal in wild birds and poultry. Poultry outbreaks due to influenza A/H5N8 have been reported as early as 1983 in Ireland, and since 2010, H5N8-associated outbreaks were detected among wild birds in Asia with subsequent spread to domestic birds across China, South Korea, and Japan [1-3]. In 2016, a novel reassortant virus of subtype H5N8 clade 2.3.4.4 was reported in Russia, with further spread to many countries in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East [4-5].

The spread of HPAI (H5N8) strains has been linked to the overlapping flyways of migratory wild birds that come from different continents; this mingling of wild birds poses a major concern worldwide [6-7].

All human infections caused by a new influenza subtype are required to be reported under the International Health Regulations (IHR, 2005). This includes any influenza A virus that has demonstrated the capacity to infect humans when its haemagglutinin gene (or protein) is not a mutated form of those -- i.e. A(H1) or A(H3) -- circulating widely in the human population. Information from these notifications is critical to inform risk assessments for influenza at the human-animal interface [8].

The above newswires report the 1st human cases of avian influenza A/H5N8 and highlight the potential for zoonotic transmission of this novel subtype and other influenza viruses and the need for continuous monitoring and surveillance of the circulating strains in animals and humans. In this regard, Global influenza surveillance has been conducted through WHO's Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS) since 1952, with key objectives:

- Global mechanism of surveillance, preparedness and response for seasonal, pandemic and zoonotic influenza;
- Global platform for monitoring influenza epidemiology and disease; and
- Global alert for novel influenza viruses and other respiratory pathogens.

There are enough historical events that have resulted in limited or global pandemics due to influenza, and more recently, novel SARS-CoV2, that highlight the need for a One Health approach towards public health preparedness.

H5N8 is typically not associated with humans; however, as per the recent reports from various sources, up to 7 people in Russia have been found to be infected with the virus to date.
