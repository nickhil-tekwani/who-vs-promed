[1] Senegal: top priority emergency (WHO)
Date: 30 Aug 2014

On 30 Aug 2014, Senegal's Ministry of Public Health and Social Affairs provided WHO with details about a case of Ebola virus disease (EVD) announced in that country on 29 Aug 2014. WHO has also received details of the emergency investigation immediately launched by the Government. Testing and confirmation of EVD were undertaken by a laboratory at the Institut Pasteur in Dakar [capital of Senegal].

The case is a 21-year-old male native of Guinea who arrived in Dakar by road on 20 Aug 2014 and stayed with relatives at a home in the outskirts of the city. On 23 Aug 2014, he sought medical care for symptoms that included fever, diarrhoea, and vomiting. He received treatment for malaria, but did not improve and left the facility. After leaving the facility, he continued to reside with his relatives. Though the investigation is in its early stages, he is not presently known to have travelled elsewhere. On 26 Aug 2014, he was referred to a specialized facility for infectious diseases, still showing the same symptoms, and was hospitalized. On 27 Aug 2014, authorities in Conakry, Guinea issued an alert informing medical services in Guinea and neighbouring countries that a person who was a close contact of a confirmed EVD patient had escaped the surveillance system. That alert prompted testing at the Dakar laboratory, launching an investigation and triggering urgent contact tracing.

Health sector response
-------------------
WHO is treating this 1st case in Senegal as a top priority emergency. Key operational personnel were dispatched to Dakar [30 Aug 2014]; others will follow. The Government of Senegal has informed WHO of the urgent need for epidemiological support, personal protective equipment, and hygiene kits. These needs will be met with the fastest possible speed.

[2] Ebolavirus vaccine to be trialed in September 2014 in Oxford, UK
Date: 30 Aug 2014

Oxford University's Jenner Institute, led by Professor Adrian Hill, is to begin human trials of a potential vaccine against the ebolavirus. The 1st round of trials should take place at the Oxford Vaccine Centre in Churchill Hospital in September [2014], subject to approval, and involve 60 volunteers from the Oxford area. If these prove successful, trials will be extended to volunteers in the Gambia and Mali to account for potential differences between European and West African responses.

There is no risk of volunteers becoming infected with ebolavirus themselves, as Professor Hill explains: "The vaccine takes a gene from the ebolavirus and puts in it a virus carrier. The carrier happens to be a safe version of a common cold virus."

The trials have received accelerated funding due to the current EVD epidemic, which has killed more than 1500 people at the time of writing. The Jenner Institute is working in tandem with GlaxoSmithKline and the US government's National Institute of Health. ...

[3] Prevention & suspect cases

Nigeria: contacts
----------------
31 Aug 2014: (PressTV) Some 160 people have been placed under medical surveillance over the deadly Ebola virus [disease] in the Nigerian city of Port Harcourt in Rivers State. "As of today [31 Aug 2014], none of them has shown symptoms of any kind. We are in touch with them constantly, and they also call us to tell us their condition," Sampson Parker, the health commissioner of Rivers State, said on Fri [29 Aug 2014]. The people who are being monitored had been in contact with a doctor who died from the virus. The Nigerian government said on Thursday [28 Aug 2014] that the doctor, Ikyke Samuel Enuemo, was the country's 6th person to die from the disease. http://www.presstv.ir/detail/2014/08/29/377028/nigeria-monitors-160-people-over-ebola

Spain (Malaga) ex Nigeria
---------------------
31 Aug 2014: Malaga Regional Hospital has activated its EVD protocol after the arrival at 5:30 a.m. of a 40-year-old man with symptoms of the virus. The patient, of Nigerian origin and a resident of Antequera, returned on 17 Aug 2014 from a journey to his homeland; he presented with a very high fever at the moment of his admission.

These circumstances obliged the Andalusian Health Service to activate its EVD protocol and immediately admit the patient. He is now in isolation in the infectious-cases unit of the 5th floor of Carlos Haya Hospital. He is in a room designed for his condition and is being cared for by professionals "prepared and equipped for it," according to sources in the Regional Hospital.

The patient arrived in the morning at the Carlos de Haya Regional Hospital, having come from Antequera to Malaga. Although an ambulance was ready to transport him, he used his own vehicle to make the trip to the capital. He arrived accompanied by his wife and 2 [other] children, who had no symptoms and could return home [to their holiday apartment].

The entire family recently returned from a trip to Nigeria, where, according to WHO, the virus has spread with force recently. "At the moment, this is only a suspected case, but since he has been in a danger zone recently, we feel obliged to treat the case as if he were infected with EVD," hospital sources said. http://www.laopiniondemalaga.es/malaga/2014/08/31/paciente-padecer-ebola-varon-nigeriano/703738.html [in Spanish, trans. by Crawford Kilian.

WHO helps Gambia prevent EVD
-------------------------------
30 Aug 2014: (Xinhua) The World Health Organization (WHO) has equipped the Gambian Ministry of Health and Social Welfare with laboratory materials to combat the deadly EVD, Gambia's officials said on Sat [30 Aug 2014]. "We are supporting the government through its ministry to close ranks against the deadly EVD, which is spreading in West Africa," said Charles Saego Moses, a WHO country Representative in Gambia. The materials were handed over to the ministry through the ministry deputy permanent secretary Dawda Ceesay, who noted that Gambia should not be complacent despite [the fact] that no EVD case has been detected in the country. ... The ministry has increased surveillance teams at the border to ensure the health check of those going out of and coming into Gambia, Ceesay said. According to the WHO, more than 3000 people have been infected with EVD. On Fri [29 Aug 2014], Senegal, Gambia's neighboring country, confirmed its 1st case of EVD, making it the 5th West African country to be affected by the outbreak.

Sierra Leone: strike averted
----------------------
31 Aug 2014: (AP) In Sierra Leone on Sunday [31 Aug 2014], officials said they had avoided a strike threatened by workers at an EVD treatment center [Kenema] in the east of the country, the region hardest hit by the outbreak. Protective equipment is being sent to the health workers and a "monthly incentive allowance" will be paid on Mon [1 Sep 2014], health ministry spokesman Sidie Yahya Tunis told The Associated Press. On Fri [29 Aug 2014], Sierra Leone President Ernest Bai Koroma replaced Health Minister Miatta Kargbo with Abu Bakarr Fofanah, a move his office described as necessary to more efficiently combat the outbreak. Kargbo was recalled to work in the president's office. http://bigstory.ap.org/article/who-senegal-ebola-case-top-priority-emergency
