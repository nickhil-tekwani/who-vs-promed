Yogyakarta has 2 bird flu suspects early 2009
---------------------------------------------
The Yogyakarta authorities have warned the people to be on alert, as
2 bird flu suspects were found in Yogyakarta in early 2009. Bird flu
cases were first detected in Yogyakarta in 2005, Tri Harjun Ismaji,
the secretary of the Yogyakarta special autonomous province, said [in
Yogyakarta] on Tuesday [24 Feb 2009] in a speech read out by Bondan
Agus Suryanto.

In 2005, Yogyakarta had 6 bird flu suspects, 4 suspects in 2006, 24
in 2007, and 3 suspects last year [2008], he said. Bird flu or avian
influenza (AI) was very dangerous as there were 129 cases of AI
infections including 113 fatalities, or 81.3 percent, he said.

Two children suspected bird flu infection in Klaten, Central Java
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Two children, a 5-year-old boy and his one-year-old cousin, residents
of Dusun Kemalang, Desa Dompol, Kecamatan Kemalang, were admitted to
RSUP Dr Soeradji hospital on Wednesday [25 Feb 2009] as suspect [bird
flu] patients. These 2 children are developing fever, flu, and
breathing difficulty after a dozen chickens belonging to the family
suddenly died.

Patients are relatives and their houses are close to each other. The
5-year-old was admitted to hospital on Tuesday evening [24 Feb 2009]
after [a] few days developing fever. He was admitted to a public
health [center] prior to this, but his fever and breathing problem
did not improve. Investigation showed a history of dead fowls in the
neighborhood, therefore the patient was redirected to RSUP for bird
flu observation where he was placed in the isolation unit.

His baby cousin exhibited the same symptoms after that and was
admitted to RSUP on Wednesday [25 Feb 2009]. His mother said that her
child had fever and breathing problem after the sudden death of 15
chickens in their village. The dead chickens are being tested for
bird flu infection by the Agricultural Service and Livestock
Subdivision.

The 2 suspects are still under observation. Blood and swab sample
also have been taken for further examination. Patients are also
examined every 8 hours at the isolation unit. Current results showed
no specific [signs of] bird flu infection such as pneumonia, acute
lung inflammation, or leukocyte depression.

[Respiratory infections of varying severity are common in childhood.
Consequently not all of these suspected cases of avian H5N1 influenza
virus infection are likely to be the result of exposure to diseased
poultry. Indeed, no human case of avian influenza has been confirmed
since December 2008 according to the WHO Timeline at
<http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/Timeline_09_02_23.pdf>.
