Epidemiological update: Hepatitis of unknown etiology in children
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
The etiology and pathogenetic mechanisms of disease are still under investigation. A possible association with current adenovirus infection has been found in cases in the UK in particular, but other hypotheses and possible co-factors are under investigation. Most cases continue to be reported as sporadic un-linked cases.

This report presents an update of probable cases identified in the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and worldwide. Whereas cases detected in the EU/EEA have been reported according to the ECDC/WHO case definition, worldwide cases are collected through screening of official websites and media sources, and therefore, different case definitions could have been used.

Case definition used in EU/EEA:
----------------------------------
Confirmed: N/A
Probable: a person presenting with an acute hepatitis (non-hepatitis viruses A, B, C, D, and E) with aspartate transaminase (AST) or alanine transaminase (ALT) over 500 IU/L, who is 16 years old or younger, since 1 Oct 2021
Epi-linked: a person presenting with an acute hepatitis (non-hepatitis viruses A, B, C, D, and E) of any age who is a close contact of a probable case since 1 Oct 2021
Cases of hepatitis with known etiology such as those due to specific infectious diseases, drug toxicity, and metabolic, hereditary, or autoimmune disorders should not be reported under this protocol.

In EU/EEA countries, approximately 105 cases have been identified in 13 EU/EEA countries as of 10 May 2022.

Number of identified cases by country, EU/EEA, 10 May 2022
---------------------------------------------------
Country / Cases
Austria / 2
Belgium / 3
Cyprus / 2
Denmark / 6
France / 2
Ireland / Fewer than 5
Italy / 35
Netherlands / 6
Norway / 4
Poland / 1
Portugal / 8
Spain / 22
Sweden / 9
Total / Between 102 and 106

Worldwide update
---------------------
UK: As of 3 May 2022, the UKHSA has identified a total of 163 children, aged under 16 years, with acute hepatitis of unknown etiology. Of these cases, 11 children have received a liver transplant. A 2nd detailed technical briefing on the investigations among the UK cases was published by the UKHSA on 6 May 2022.

Outside of EU/EEA and the UK: As of 10 May 2022, there are at least 181 cases of acute hepatitis among children. Cases have been reported by Argentina [8], Brazil [16], Canada [7], Costa Rica [2], Indonesia [15], Israel [12], Japan [7], Panama [1], Palestine [1], Serbia [1], Singapore [1], South Korea [1], and the USA [at least 109].

The total number of cases reported worldwide is approximately 450, including 11 deaths reported from Indonesia [5], Palestine [1], and the United States [5]. On 3 May 2022, the media quoting public health authorities reported a death of an 8-year-old child with acute hepatitis of unknown etiology in Palestine. It is currently unclear whether this is the same child who was diagnosed in the previous week. Confirmation of this case is pending.

Actions: On 28 Apr 2022, ECDC published a rapid risk assessment. ECDC has established reporting of case-based data for cases of acute hepatitis of unknown etiology in The European Surveillance System (TESSy). The reporting protocol is available here, and countries are strongly encouraged to report cases to TESSy. A separate report based on the data reported in TESSy will be published shortly.

An EpiPulse item remains available to member states (MS) to report updates on their investigations in order to inform and facilitate communication between MS and ECDC.

ECDC will continue to monitor this event through its epidemic intelligence activities.

A pediatric hepatitis outbreak with mysterious origins is continuing to grow, as more USA states investigate cases of kids developing the liver illness without a known cause. The CDC are investigating 109 cases in 24 states and Puerto Rico, Dr. Jay Butler, CDC's deputy director for infectious diseases, said during a media briefing Friday [6 May 2022]. The agency is also investigating 5 deaths linked to the outbreak. Most of the 109 children required hospitalization, and 8 needed a liver transplant. Two weeks ago, just 11 cases in the USA had been identified. Worldwide, at least 228 such cases have been reported in 20 countries, the WHO said earlier this week. Hepatitis refers to an inflammation of the liver, which is usually caused by one of the hepatitis viruses -- hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E -- but in these recent cases, these viruses were ruled out as the cause.

The 1st reported cases in the USA were in Alabama in October 2021. The CDC issued an alert and a report on the cluster of 9 cases. All of the children, between one and 6 in age, tested positive for adenovirus, which the CDC and WHO are investigating as a possible cause of the global outbreak. It has not been confirmed. Five of the Alabama children tested positive for a specific type of adenovirus, adenovirus 41.

In the USA cases overall, adenovirus was detected in half of patients, the CDC said Friday [6 May 2022]. Adenoviruses are common, usually causing cold-like and gastrointestinal symptoms. Prior to these cases, adenoviruses were not known to cause hepatitis in otherwise healthy children, per the CDC. In all of the US cases under investigation, the children were previously healthy with no underlying conditions.

"There's no link to one geographic area, common exposure to particular foods or animals, travel, or to toxins," Dr. Philippa Easterbrook, an infectious disease physician with the WHO, said during a media briefing Wednesday [4 May 2022]. Most of the children are too young to have received the COVID-19 vaccine and do not have any evidence of a COVID-19 infection.

"If indeed adenovirus is the responsible virus, this potentially is contagious," Dr. Esther Israel, a pediatric gastroenterologist Mass General Hospital for Children, previously told Today.

The following states have either said they are investigating cases of pediatric hepatitis with an unknown cause or have health facilities that have reported seeing such cases:

Alabama:
The 1st report the CDC issued on the mysterious hepatitis focused on a cluster of 9 cases spread across different parts of Alabama. The CDC said Alabama is one of the 24 states where it is investigating cases.

Minnesota:
The Minnesota Department of Health is investigating "several cases" of hepatitis in kids with an unknown cause, local NBC affiliate KARE 11 reported in late April 2022. The CDC said Minnesota is one of the 24 states where it is investigating cases.

Wisconsin:
As of late April 2022, the Wisconsin Department of Health is investigating at least 4 cases of unusual hepatitis in children, including one death and one liver transplant. The CDC said Wisconsin is one of the 24 states where it is investigating cases.

South Dakota:
The South Dakota Department of Health is investigating a case in a child under 10 years old in Brown County, it announced Wed 4 May 2022.

[These 2 posts contain pretty up-to-date tabulations of the overall suspected cases. It remains to be seen whether all of the cases are due to one etiology or not.

Possible etiologies:
- Adenovirus type 41, one of the enteric adenoviruses, has been found in the blood of many of the cases but has not been known to cause hepatitis in immunocompetent people and was not found using metagenomics in the liver. It is not yet known whether type 41 is similar to older isolates of this adenovirus serotype.

- SARS-CoV-2 can cause hepatitis, which may be much more prominent in children with MIS-C (multisystem inflammatory disease in children). Only some of the children were actively infected with this virus at the time of the hepatitis, but no substantial data has yet been published regarding past infection with SARS-CoV-2, as some cases of MIS-C are thought to be late sequelae. It is not clear if the undefined severe hepatitis cases actually fit the multi-system disease case definition.

- Adeno-associated virus 2 was found in some cases in the liver as reported by UKHSA, but it has not been known to cause hepatitis in humans and may be just reactivating the latent genome, which can integrate into the human genome.

- A possible link to dog ownership has also been suggested by UKHSA.

To date, no peer-reviewed studies on this growing outbreak have been published. ProMED awaits more information regarding blood and liver metagenomics, evidence for past COVID-19 infection, and screening of asymptomatic household contacts for elevated aminotransferases. I am sure that patient serum specimens and hopefully samples from household contacts are being saved for later testing. - Mod.LL]
