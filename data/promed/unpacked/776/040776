Kinnow [mandarin hybrid] orchards have been attacked by an unknown disease in [Sargodha] district. Growers [said that] no action had been advised. Officials have termed the disease viral, caused by excessive use of pesticides at orchards [see comment below].

Citrus Research Institute Sargodha (CRIS) said growers should consult the experts [and] also urged farmers to ensure proper irrigation of orchards. CRIS experts were counseling farmers regarding diseases. [They] confirmed that 30 per cent low[er] kinnow yield was expected during [the 2018] season and farmers should pay maximum attention to their orchards.

[Numerous diseases of citrus are being reported from the region, as well as multifactorial 'dieback' complexes, which may also include additional environmental factors. It is not clear which specific problem is reported here. While disease management for most citrus pathogens includes clean planting stock and elimination of pathogen reservoirs, conclusive molecular diagnosis of the pathogen(s) involved is needed to design effective management strategies.

It is thought that combinations of various pathogens may have contributed to the general decline of citrus health in the region due to accumulation of parasitic pathogens in old orchards over time. Extensive harvest failures have led to citrus replanting programmes (ProMED-mail post 20080130.0375), but these will only be of long term benefit if linked to an ongoing crop sanitation and monitoring programme to prevent re-introduction of pathogens, especially into orchards used as sources for propagating material.

The claim above that the problem in Pakistan is due to a "viral" pathogen and at the same time caused by excessive pesticide use makes no sense -- one would preclude the other as a cause. It appears likely that the term "viral" is used as a general indication of a disease or disorder, not to indicate a particular pathogen. An outbreak of citrus canker (_Xanthomonas axonopodis_ pv. _citri_) in Punjab was reported initially in early 2015 in orange groves (ProMED-mail post 20150415.3298470) and later also in kinnow mandarins (_Citrus nobilis_ x _C. deliciosa_; ProMED-mail post 20160111.3927802). The report above may also refer to a continuation of that problem.
