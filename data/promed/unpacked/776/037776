The western Mongolian province of Govi-Altai has been quarantined for an indefinite period [see comment below] due to the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) in animals, local media reported on Wednesday [20 Oct 2021].

"Currently, the highly contagious FMD has been diagnosed in Sharga, Taishir, and Esunbulag soums (administrative subdivisions) in our province [see comment], and the prevalence is increasing. Therefore, a quarantine regime has been imposed across the province for an indefinite period," local media quoted the provincial government as saying in a statement.

So far this year [2021], the highly contagious disease, which spreads among cloven-hoofed animals such as cattle, sheep, and pigs, has broken out in more than half of Mongolia's 21 provinces, according to the General Authority for Veterinary Services.

Govi-Altai is one of the western provinces of Mongolia that are adjacent to China.

The livestock sector is a main pillar of the Mongolian economy with around 70 million heads of livestock in the country with a population of around 3.4 million.

The landlocked country is striving to develop its livestock sector by raising meat exports in a bid to diversify its mining-dependent economy, while frequent outbreaks of livestock diseases such as FMD and [lumpy skin disease] are impeding the process.

The country's meat exports have been suspended since June [2021] due to infectious animal diseases, according to the Mongolian National Chamber of Commerce and Industry.

[According to the local media, the infected livestock holdings are located in Ulaantug in Sharga soum, Khurimt in Taishir soum, and Rashaant bagh in Esenbulag soum. The movement of households with outbreaks of highly contagious animal diseases will be stopped until the end of this year (21 Dec 2021). Other activities, such as competitions, are completely banned (https://bit.ly/3C7WQRM; in Mongolian, machine trans).

The FMD (serotype O) epizootic in Mongolia, started (recurred) on 6 Aug 2021 (was confirmed 9 Aug 2021 and reported on 7 Sep 2021; see OIE data in ProMED post 20210908.8654984). It involved the aimag (province) of Uvurkhangai. Reportedly, vaccination "following an outbreak" has commenced.

According to Mongolia's page on WRLFMD [FAO World Reference Laboratory for Foot-and-Mouth Disease] website, the most recent samples received from Mongolia were sampled in 2018. Of the 6 genotyped samples, 5 were serotype O, topotype 'ME-SA,' lineage 'Ind-2001', sublineage 'e', and one was serotype O, topotype 'SEA', lineage 'Mya-98'. The genotyping results and relations of the Mongolian 2018 strain to other FMDV O strains are available at https://www.wrlfmd.org/sites/world/files/quick_media/WRLFMD-2019-00003-MON-GTR-O-O_002.pdf. Chinese strains were not included in the comparative tests. Genotyping results of FMD strains currently circulating in China will be helpful.

Data on the genotyping profile of the current strain and the efficacy (matching rate) of the vaccines used will be helpful. The matching strain differentiation report of 3 vaccines to the strains circulating in Mongolia during 2018 is available at https://www.wrlfmd.org/sites/world/files/quick_media/WRLFMD-2019-00003-MON-VMR-O-O_001.pdf. - Mod.AS
