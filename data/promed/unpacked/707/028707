Multistate Outbreak of Listeriosis Â— United States, 1998
Since early August 1998, 40 illnesses caused by a single strain of Listeria
monocytogenes (LM) have been identified in 10 states: Ohio (13 cases); New
York (12); Tennessee, Massachusetts, and West Virginia (three each);
Michigan (two); and Connecticut, Oregon, Vermont, and Georgia (one each).
Dates of illness onset or LM isolation ranged from August 2 through
December 2. All LM isolates from these cases are serotype 4b and share an
unusual pattern when subtyped either by pulsed field gel electrophoresis or
by ribotyping methods. Historically, this pattern is rare among LM isolates
from humans.
Among 38 patients for whom demographic data are available, six were
newborns and 32 were adults (median age: 69 years; range: 18-88 years); 55%
of patients were female. Four deaths occurred, including one fetus and
three elderly persons. In collaboration with CDC, health departments in
Connecticut, New York, Ohio, and Tennessee conducted a multistate
case-control study comparing 4-week food histories of 20 patients infected
with the outbreak strain with those of 20 control patients infected with
other LM strains. Sixteen (89%) of 18 cases but only six (32%) of 19
controls consumed cooked hot dogs during the month before illness onset
(odds ratio=17.3; 95% confidence interval=2.4-160.0; p less than 0.01). On
December 19, the outbreak strain of LM was isolated from an open package of
hot dogs. These hot dogs had been eaten by a patient 4 weeks before onset
of listeriosis caused by the outbreak strain.
On December 22, the manufacturer, Bil Mar Foods, voluntarily recalled
specific production lots of hot dogs and other meat products that might be
contaminated. The affected products bear the establishment numbers EST P261
or EST 6911 and include the Ball Park, Bil Mar, Bryan Bunsize and Bryan
3-lb Club Pack, Grillmaster, Hygrade, Mr. Turkey, Sara Lee Deli Meat, and
Sara Lee Home Roast brands. The establishment number appears on the outer
edge of all packages. Packages for the above brand names that carry any
other establishment numbers are not affected by the recall. An
investigation by CDC is ongoing with local and state health departments.
Recent cases of listeriosis should be reported to CDC through state and
local health departments. Consumers should return recalled product to the
point of purchase.
