This week [week of 14 Jul 2015], there are already 96 cases. In the same period of last year [2014], there were 58 cases of infection. The increase amounted to 65.5 percent.

Last week [week of 6 Jul 2015], 3 people contracted encephalitis, so the number of encephalitis cases rose to 15 cases. Last year [2014], the number of encephalitis was 3 times less.

In 2015, the number of registered tick bites is 6997, including 1552 children (in 2014, the number of bites was 32 percent less, with 5299 cases).

This is the season of tickborne encephalitis (TBE) virus transmission in Russia. Russia, especially western Siberia, has the largest number of reported TBE cases. For additional details on TBE, see Mod.LL's extensive comments drawn from the US CDC (http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2014/chapter-3-infectious-diseases-related-to-travel/tickborne-encephalitis). The CDC information notes that in Russia, 2 inactivated TBE vaccines are available: TBE-Moscow (Chumakov Institute, Russia) and EnceVir (Microgen, Russia). The European and Russian vaccines should provide cross-protection against all 3 TBEV subtypes. Vaccine failures have been reported, particularly in people aged over 50 years. - Mod.TY]
