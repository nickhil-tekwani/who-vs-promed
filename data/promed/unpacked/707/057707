[1] Impact of COVID-19 on health systems

Medical staff in UK hospitals told Insider they're struggling to cope with the chaos of the coronavirus crisis.

Dr. Tom Dolphin, who works in a London hospital, said the oxygen tank outside is creaking from the amount needed for COVID-19 patients. Cancer wards are being emptied to make way for coronavirus patients, Dr. Danish Dewan told Insider. As you walk past the oxygen tank outside one London hospital, you can hear it creaking and clanking because of just how much oxygen it's pumping out to support patients inside the building.

That's according to Dr. Tom Dolphin, an anaesthetic consultant in the city, who told Insider that medical staff across the UK are anxious about oxygen running out. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said Tuesday [12 Jan 2021] that the health service wasn't facing an oxygen shortage but admitted some hospitals may have to transfer COVID-19 patients to other hospitals to get them the oxygen they need. Without sufficient oxygen supplies, doctors and nurses can't properly treat patients suffering from shortness of breath, one of the many symptoms of COVID-19.

Diminishing oxygen levels are just one part of a serious crisis brewing in the country. The UK's National Health Service (NHS) is on the brink of collapse as floods of patients suffering from COVID-19 overwhelm hospitals, and a recent surge in cases will likely make things [worse]. According to the latest government statistics, 417 570 Brits tested positive between 4-10 Jan 2021, which is 14% more than the previous week. UK prime minister Boris Johnson said in a meeting Wednesday [13 Jan 2021] there was a "very substantial" risk of intensive care capacity in hospitals being "overtopped." He added that the situation in the NHS was "very, very tough" and the pressure on staff was "colossal."

Chris Whitty, England's chief medical officer, warned that the country was entering the "most dangerous time" of the pandemic and that the "next few weeks are going to be the worst" for the NHS. Dolphin told Insider that hospitals across the nation suddenly got very busy in the 48 hours after 6 Jan 2021. He said that NHS staff are so afraid of services being stretched that some hospitals will likely have to shut their doors to patients without COVID-19 and send them to other hospitals. "The sheer size of this wave and the ferocity of it has really left us struggling as an NHS nationally to cope, which is why we're seeing people being treated in car parks in some hospitals," Dolphin said. In some cases, patients are waiting up to 10 hours in the back of ambulances to be transferred into hospitals, a leading paramedic, Tracy Nicholls, told Sky News on 10 Jan 2021. This will have long-term consequences for the NHS, Dolphin said.

After a new, more transmissible coronavirus strain was found in south-east England in December 2020, and has since spread round the country, UK hospitals have become some of the fullest in Europe. Medical staff have been forced to cancel planned operations because COVID-19 sufferers are displacing other patients.

On 6 Jan 2021, an NHS presentation to senior doctors, reported by the Financial Times, forecasted hospitals in London would be short of nearly 2000 beds by 19 Jan 2021 as a "best-case scenario." The following day, NHS officials warned that 800 patients were being admitted to hospitals in the capital city every day, and that the health service would be overwhelmed in 2 weeks if cases don't drop significantly.

London will send hundreds of soldiers into hospitals to support struggling intensive care units, the Independent reported Thursday [14 Jan 2021]. "Some cancer work is being postponed again like it was in March and April 2020, which is not where we want to be. But we just don't have the staff, the space, or the capacity in the hospital to manage those patients," Dolphin said.

Hospitals in Nottingham, in the East Midlands region, are seeing a rise in COVID-19-related admissions and have more patients now than during the peak of the 1st wave in April 2020, according to Dr. Keith Girling, a medical director at Nottingham University Hospitals Trust. "The increase in COVID-positive cases within our hospitals started to accelerate over the Christmas period, which is very concerning," Girling said in a statement, but added they are making "excellent progress" on vaccinations. Instead of doing his normal job anaesthetizing patients for operations and other procedures, Dolphin has retrained, and now spends his days vaccinating as many people as he can. In order to be able to keep services afloat, Dolphin said that all healthcare workers must be vaccinated by the end of January 2021. More than one in 7 staff are off work sick in some hospitals, he said.

According to the chair of the British Medical Association, Chaand Nagpaul, there are more than 46 000 hospital staff off sick with COVID-19, per the Guardian, nearly 4% of the entire 1.3 million NHS workforce.

Johnson said Monday [11 Jan 2021] that 2 million people in the country have already received a coronavirus vaccine, and about 400 000 people have had 2 doses. The plan is to get 13 million people vaccinated by mid-February 2021, but Dolphin described the vaccine rollout as "chaotic." "We are at that point of potential catastrophe for the NHS, and if we don't vaccinate the healthcare staff 1st, there won't be an NHS for people to come to." Nearly half of London's hospital workers, including ambulance workers, cleaners, porters, and frontline nurses, are still waiting to be offered a COVID-19 vaccine, according to a survey by the trade union GMB, cited by the Independent Wednesday [13 Jan 2021].

Dolphin compared it to a passenger on a plane putting an oxygen mask on someone else before themselves. "You've got to look after the healthcare staff, otherwise we're not going to be there to help everybody else."

Portugal's fragile health system is under growing pressure due to a worrying rise in coronavirus infections, with the country reporting 10 947 new cases and 166 deaths on Saturday [16 Jan 2021], the worst surge since the pandemic started last year [2020]. The cases, which come a day after a new lockdown was put in place, bring the total number of cases in a country of just over 10 million people to 539 416, with the death toll increasing to 8709.

The number of infections per 100 000 people measured over the past 14 days is 901, nearly double that in hard-hit neighbouring Spain, data from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control showed. The health system, which prior to the pandemic had the lowest number of critical care beds per 100 000 inhabitants in Europe, can accommodate a maximum of 672 COVID-19 patients in ICUs, according to Health Ministry data. There are currently 638 people in ICUs, and the Portuguese Association of Hospital Administrators said the number of coronavirus patients needing hospitalisation was likely to dramatically increase over the next week.

A group of 3 major hospitals in Lisbon only had 3 intensive care beds left for coronavirus patients on Saturday [16 Jan 2021] morning, according to the Observador newspaper. Media images of ambulances with coronavirus patients queuing outside hospitals in Lisbon and elsewhere as they waited for beds to vacate have raised fears that the health system is close to reaching its limit. "I have received information of a patient who died inside an ambulance," Jaime Soares, the head of the Portuguese Firefighters League, told Lusa news agency, adding hospitals are also running out of emergency stretchers.

In Porto, the country's 2nd largest city, the Sao Joao hospital is already receiving "various" patients from Lisbon as hospitals in the capital struggle to cope, a spokesman said.

[It has been over a little over 12 months, and the COVID-19 pandemic continues to exert enormous pressure on health systems around the world, which highlights the preparedness levels of even those classified as high-performing and their capacity to cope with protracted demands for services. Not only the resilience of the health facilities has been and continues to be tested, the physical and psychological impacts of continuous demands for provision of critical health care on the health staff have also become apparent.

Three levels of resilience can be applied to understand the capacity of health systems to cope: absorptive capacity, adaptive capacity, and transformative capacity. In response to the current COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen that even previously high-performing health systems have been overstretched to adapt, affecting their ability to transform and manage the surge demands.

It is important going forward that the global health community evaluates its current metrics for health systems based on the lessons we have learned and are still learning during this pandemic. Doing so will help more reliably assess the world's preparedness at the country level, to prevent future pandemics from having a disastrous effect similar to COVID-19's and contain them as close as possible to their source.

Somehow, we will have to ride out these waves of the ongoing pandemic and hopefully learn from it to plan our health system resources in line with principles of Universal Health Coverage (UHC) coupled with better disease surveillance and detection at all levels. - Mod.UBA]

[2] Vaccine-related adverse reactions
[A] Israel
Date: Sat 16 Jan 2021
Source: RT [edited]
https://www.rt.com/news/512736-israel-facial-paralysis-13-covid-vaccine/


At least 13 Israelis have experienced facial paralysis after being administered the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine, a month after the US Food and Drug Administration reported similar issues but said they weren't linked to the jab.

Israel has been hailed for its speedy and efficient mass inoculation program, which has vaccinated a staggering 20 percent of the country's population since the drive began at the end of December [2020]. For a handful of Israelis, however, the initiative has led to some unexpected health scares. At least 13 people have reported mild facial paralysis after receiving the Pfizer/BioNTech jab, Israeli outlet Ynet reported, citing the Health Ministry, adding that officials believe the number of such cases could be higher. "For at least 28 hours I walked around with it [facial paralysis]," one person who had the side effect told Ynet. "I can't say it was completely gone afterwards, but other than that, I had no other pains, except a minor pain where the injection was, but there was nothing beyond that." The unnamed individual noted, though, that the unpleasant reaction was "something rare" and stressed that it was "important" people get vaccinated. However, he conceded that he was undecided about receiving a 2nd dose of the vaccine.

Israel's Health Ministry has stated that it is safe to administer the 2nd shot, provided the facial paralysis passes and there are no lingering, long-term effects from the 1st jab. But some Israeli medical experts have chosen to ignore this advisory. Ynet quoted Prof. Galia Rahav, director of the Infectious Diseases Unit at Sheba Medical Center, who said she did not feel "comfortable" with administering the 2nd dose to someone who had received the 1st jab and subsequently suffered from paralysis. "No one knows if this is connected to the vaccine or not. That's why I would refrain from giving a 2nd dose to someone who suffered from paralysis after the 1st dose," she told the outlet.

Last month [December 2020] the FDA disclosed that Bell's palsy, a form of temporary facial paralysis, was reported by 4 participants during phase 3 trials of the Pfizer vaccine. All 4 cases involved individuals who had been given the actual jab. There were no reports of paralysis among the control group that received a placebo. In its report, the FDA noted the "numerical imbalance" of Bell's palsy cases among the vaccine and placebo groups, but it said there were no other "non-serious adverse events" that showed a similar pattern. Ultimately, the US drug regulator concluded that the issue was "consistent with the expected background rate in the general population," and added that there was no clear evidence linking the coronavirus vaccine to the unpleasant medical condition. Still, the agency recommended "surveillance for cases of Bell's palsy with deployment of the vaccine into larger populations."

Over the past several weeks, the Pfizer drug has received emergency approval from governments scrambling to vaccinate their citizens. In December 2020, the UK became the 1st country in the world to begin administering the jab to the general population. Although health officials have described the vaccine as safe and effective at reducing Covid-19 symptoms, worrying reports continue to surface about serious adverse effects. Mexico launched a probe in early January 2021 after a young doctor was left paralyzed minutes after being administered the drug. There have also been numerous cases in which people who suffer from allergies have experienced severe reactions to the shot.

Several reports have also linked the jab to unexplained deaths, but authorities have insisted that there is no evidence to suggest the vaccine is to blame in such cases. For example, a Portuguese doctor who was reportedly in "perfect health" died shortly after being given the jab, but officials later concluded that there was no relationship between the death and the vaccine, adding that they could not disclose the exact cause of her death for legal reasons.

23 people died in Norway within days of receiving their 1st dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine, with 13 of those deaths -- all nursing home patients -- apparently related to the side effects of the shots, health officials said. Common reactions to the vaccine, including fever and nausea, "may have contributed to a fatal outcome in some frail patients," Sigurd Hortemo, chief physician at the Norwegian Medicines Agency, said in a Friday [15 Jan 2021] statement. All 13 were nursing home patients and at least 80 years old. While officials aren't expressing serious concern, they are adjusting their guidance on who should receive the vaccine. The news comes just over a week after officials reported the deaths of just 2 nursing home residents after they received the Pfizer jab.

More than 30 000 people in Norway have received the 1st shot of the Pfizer or Moderna coronavirus vaccine in the Scandinavian country since late last month [December 2020], according to official figures. "We are not alarmed by this," Steinar Madsen, medical director with the agency, told Norwegian broadcaster NRK. "It is quite clear that these vaccines have very little risk, with a small exception for the frailest patients. Doctors must now carefully consider who should be vaccinated," he added. "Those who are very frail and at the very end of life can be vaccinated after an individual assessment."

The agency reported Thursday [14 Jan 2021] that a total of 29 people had suffered side effects, including the 13 people who died. 21 women and 8 men experienced side effects, officials said. Besides those who died, 9 had serious side effects -- including allergic reactions, strong discomfort, and severe fever -- while 7 had less serious ones, including severe pain at the injection site.

In total, more than 57 000 cases and 500 coronavirus-related deaths have been reported in Norway, according to Johns Hopkins University. Health officials noted that around 400 people die each week in the nursing home population.

A Pfizer rep said the pharmaceutical giant is "aware of reported deaths" following the administration of the vaccine in Norway and is working with the Norwegian Medicines Agency "to gather all the relevant information." "Norwegian authorities have prioritized the immunization of residents in nursing homes, most of whom are very elderly with underlying medical conditions and some which are terminally ill," a spokeswoman said in a statement. "[The Norwegian Medicine Agency confirms] the number of incidents so far is not alarming and in line with expectations."

[Even though most vaccines are tested extensively for safety prior to introduction, like other pharmaceutical products, they are not completely risk-free, and adverse events can occasionally occur. Although most adverse events are minor (e.g., redness at the injection site, fever, pain, etc.), more serious reactions (e.g., seizures, anaphylaxis) can occur, albeit at a very low frequency.

The general public has low tolerance to any adverse events following vaccination because vaccines are given to healthy persons to prevent disease. For this reason, a higher standard of safety is expected of immunizations compared with medications that are used to treat people who are sick (e.g., antibiotics, insulin). This lower tolerance for risks from vaccines translates into a greater need to detect and investigate any adverse event following immunization (AEFI) than is generally expected for other pharmaceutical products.

Monitoring of adverse events following immunization (AEFI) is an essential strategy for ensuring the safety of vaccines. Pharmacovigilance is the practice of detecting, assessing, understanding, responding, and preventing adverse drug reactions, including reactions to vaccines. It is now an integral part of the regulation of drug and vaccine safety. Surveillance systems exist at national and international levels to ensure effective monitoring and prompt actions in response to AEFIs [https://vaccine-safety-training.org/overview-and-outcomes-4.html].

The WHO manual titled "Global Manual on Surveillance of Adverse Events Following Immunization," provides guidance on setting up AEFI surveillance systems with standardized methodologies and tools. It addresses the investigation of AEFI, how to analyze surveillance data, causality assessment, and how to respond to serious AEFI, including communication. It also includes a description of the most common vaccine reactions and provides the most recent references in vaccine pharmacovigilance; https://www.who.int/vaccine_safety/publications/aefi_surveillance/en/. - Mod.UBA]

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/1/15/more-transmissible-uk-covid-19-variant-found-in-10-us-states-cdc


A new, more transmissible variant of the coronavirus 1st discovered in the United Kingdom has been detected in 10 US states, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has said, warning that it could become the dominant circulating variant in the United States by March [2021]. The variant, known as B.1.1.7, is believed to be twice as transmissible as the current version of the virus circulating in the US, but so far, there is no evidence that it causes more severe illness or is transmitted differently. Its rapid spread will increase the burden on health resources at a time when infections are surging, further sapping strained healthcare resources and increasing the need for better adherence to mitigation strategies, such as social distancing and mask-wearing, the CDC said on Friday [15 Jan 2021] in its weekly report on death and disease.

It also increases the percentage of the population that needs to be vaccinated to achieve protective herd immunity to control the pandemic, the CDC said.

The UK variant currently is in 10 states but has been diagnosed in only 76 of the 23 million US cases reported to date. However, it's likely that this version of the virus is more widespread in the country than is currently reported, according to CDC scientists.

https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/15/brazil-a-new-covid-variant-has-been-discovered-heres-what-we-know-so-far.html


Key points
----------
- News of the variant in Brazil comes after 2 separate mutant strains of the virus were discovered in the U.K. and South Africa earlier this year [2021].
- The U.K. imposed a ban on travelers from South America (and Portugal and Cape Verde) on Friday [15 Jan 2021] in an effort to stop people from bringing the new variant into the country.
- Professor Devi Sridhar, chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh, said Friday [15 Jan 2021] that the world had become "the virus's playground to mutate and evolve, (especially) in countries which have allowed higher prevalence."

A new coronavirus variant identified in Brazil has exacerbated concern among public health experts and led to warnings that additional new strains were likely to develop. News of the variant in Brazil comes after 2 separate mutant strains of the virus were discovered in the U.K. and South Africa earlier this year [2021]. Researchers are urgently studying the Covid-19 variants, which are suspected to share similar characteristics, to gain a better understanding of the threat they pose.

Viruses naturally mutate, and there is no evidence that the newly-discovered strains have more severe disease outcomes. However, the Covid variants are thought to be more transmissible than the original one that started the pandemic, and this could lead to higher numbers of serious infections and additional deaths.

Health authorities have recommended handwashing, physical distancing, and the use of personal protective equipment as a means to prevent virus spread.

Earlier this month [January 2021], Japan's National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID) said it had detected a new Covid variant in 4 travelers from Brazil's Amazonas state on 2 Jan 2021. One male in his 40s, who was found to be asymptomatic on his arrival in Japan, was hospitalized as his respiratory condition worsened. One female in her 30s reported a sore throat and headache; one male aged between 10 and 19 recorded a fever, and one young woman over the age of 10 was asymptomatic. This variant of the virus belongs to the B.1.1.248 strain and has 12 mutations in the spike protein, the NIID said. Spike proteins are used by the virus to gain entry into cells within the body. The NIID said it was difficult to immediately determine how infectious the new strain is and the effectiveness of vaccines against it.

To date, Brazil has recorded more than 8.3 million Covid cases and 207 000 virus deaths, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. The South American country is 2nd only to the U.S. for Covid-related fatalities worldwide.

The U.K. imposed a ban on travelers from South America (and Portugal and Cape Verde) on Friday [15 Jan 2021] in an effort to stop people from bringing the new variant into the country. The country's Transport Minister Grant Shapps told the BBC it was a precautionary measure. He added that scientists think the coronavirus vaccines will work on the new variant. "We had a look at this particular mutation, as opposed to many other thousands, very carefully [and] saw there may be an issue, not so much that the vaccine won't work; in fact, scientists think it will work, but just the fact it is more spreadable," Shapps said, according to Reuters. On Thursday [14 Jan 2021], the U.K.'s Chief Scientific Adviser, Patrick Vallance, told ITV that there was a "bit more of a risk" regarding the Covid variant identified in Brazil when it came to vaccine effectiveness.

On 14 Dec 2020, health authorities in the U.K. reported a variant to the WHO identified as SARS-CoV-2 VOC 202012/01. It is unclear how the new strain originated, but preliminary findings have determined that it is highly infectious. It initially appeared in southeast England, but it has since become the dominant strain across much of Britain and has spread to more than 50 other countries. Numerous nations have imposed bans on travelers from the U.K. as a result.

Separately, national authorities in South Africa on 18 Dec 2020 announced the detection of variant 501Y.V2. Preliminary studies have shown the 501Y.V2 variant also has increased transmissibility. It has since reportedly been found in at least 20 other countries. The variants, which originated separately, both share a genetic mutation of the spike protein. Studies are ongoing to understand the transmissibility and severity of the newly-discovered Covid variants, as well as their potential impact on vaccines.

After approximately 10 months of relative inactivity, "we've started to see some striking evolution of SARS-CoV-2 with a repeated evolutionary pattern in the SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern emerging from the UK, South Africa and Brazil," Dr. Trevor Bedford, a virologist and associate professor at the University of Washington, said via Twitter on Thursday [14 Jan 2021]. Bedford, who also works with Fred Hutch's Vaccine and Infectious Disease Division, cautioned that the hypothesis was "highly speculative" at this point. "But separately, the fact that we've observed 3 variants of concern emerge since September 2020 suggests that there are likely more to come."

To date, more than 93.2 million people have contracted Covid-19 worldwide, with 1.99 million deaths. Professor Devi Sridhar, chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh, said Friday [15 Jan 2021] that the world had become "the virus's playground to mutate and evolve, (especially) in countries which have allowed higher prevalence."

A lab in Italy reported a cluster of the U.K. coronavirus variant, but that wasn't enough to stop the spread. The scenario in Italy's mountainous center shows how even when a worrisome variant is detected early, governments can miss the narrow window to mount a rapid response and limit the spread. Containment measures come too late in the wait for more substantial evidence. And the virus races ahead.

Lorusso's director quickly notified the affected region of the 4 cases. But it took more than 2 weeks for any official confirmation to reach the town of Guardiagrele and its population of 9000. During that time, overall coronavirus cases there tripled, from 35 on 28 Dec 2020 to more than 100 by mid-January 2021.

Italy reported its 1st detected case involving the British variant on 20 Dec 2020, in a traveler who had arrived from Britain. The government in Rome stopped flights from the United Kingdom the same day. But even by then, the variant was apparently already circulating in Italy. Lorusso spotted the initial 4 cases from Guardiagrele -- 3 within one family -- on 26 Dec 2020, and by 30 Dec 2020, according to a document, the lab had informed regional government officials.

Regional officials, in turn, said they needed national government confirmation of the lab results. Into mid-January 2021, the region was insisting that there was still no "definitive proof" of a variant that might be spreading differently. "The region never said to me, 'Dear mayor, there is a cluster in your town of the most infectious variant, so you'd better put a stop to everything,'" said Guardiagrele's mayor, Donatello Di Prinzio. "Had that been the case, I would have taken all the required actions." Instead, after the end of a national holiday lockdown, all of Abruzzo -- including his town -- landed back in the lightest tier of Italian restrictions, with shops and hair salons open and restaurants allowed to offer dine-in service until 6 p.m.

Meanwhile, coronavirus infections in the town were rising rapidly, reaching a point far exceeding anything from earlier waves. A local media report pointed to the variant, and there was speculation about it on Facebook. But without official word, the mayor said he didn't want to be alarmist. "I only talk when there is data in my hand and official information," he said.

[Multiple variants of the virus that causes COVID-19 have been documented in the United States and globally during this pandemic. The currently identified variants seem to spread more easily and quickly than other variants, which can lead to more cases of COVID-19. Currently, there is no evidence that these variants cause more severe illness or increased risk of death. However, an increase in the number of cases will put more strain on health care resources, lead to more hospitalizations, and potentially more deaths. Rigorous and increased compliance with public health mitigation strategies, such as vaccination, physical distancing, use of masks, hand hygiene, and isolation and quarantine, will be essential to limiting the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and protecting public health. - Mod.UBA]

[4] "Long COVID" in the skin
Date: Fri 15 Jan 2021

Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, multiple studies have reported that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is associated with dermatological manifestations. However, data on duration of signs and symptoms for the myriad dermatological manifestations of COVID-19 are lacking. Patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 who experience prolonged symptoms have been termed "long-haulers" or are said to have "long COVID," with studies reporting that 66-87% of patients continued to have one or more COVID-19 symptoms 60 days after PCR positivity. Using an international registry of COVID-19 dermatological manifestations, we evaluated the duration of dermatological signs and symptoms of COVID-19 and assessed the presence of patients with persistent skin manifestations.

In collaboration with the International League of Dermatological Societies and the American Academy of Dermatology, we established an international registry for COVID-19 dermatological manifestations in April 2020. Physicians and other health-care providers entered information on confirmed or suspected COVID-19 cases with dermatological manifestations, including PCR test results, antibody test results, and total sign and symptom duration when known. Additionally, providers were contacted in June and August 2020 to update COVID-19 laboratory test results and COVID-19 dermatological sign and symptom duration. Laboratory tests for SARS-CoV-2, including nasopharyngeal swab PCRs and serum antibody tests (IgM, IgG, and IgA), were reported when available. We defined long-haulers as patients with dermatological signs of COVID-19 that persisted for more than 60 days. Data were analysed descriptively with medians and IQRs using Stata (version 16). Duration of skin signs was calculated separately for each dermatological condition and plotted using a boxplot to illustrate IQRs and outliers.

From 8 Apr 2020, to 8 Oct 2020, 1030 total cases and 331 laboratory-confirmed or suspected COVID-19 cases with dermatological manifestations were reported in the registry from 41 countries. Of these cases, 234 total cases and 96 laboratory-confirmed cases reported data for dermatological sign and symptom duration (appendix p 1). Median duration of signs was 13 days (IQR 7-21) for all patients, and 7 days (IQR 5-14) for the subset of patients with laboratory-confirmed disease (appendix p 2). Morbilliform lasted a median of 7 days (IQR 5-10) and urticarial eruptions lasted a median of 4 days (IQR 2-10) among patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, with a maximum duration of 28 days. Papulosquamous eruptions lasted 20 days (IQR 14-28) in laboratory-confirmed cases, with one case having a confirmed long-hauler eruption lasting 70 days. Pernio lasted a median of 15 days (IQR 10-30) in patients with suspected COVID-19, and 12 days (IQR 7-23) in laboratory-confirmed cases.

7 (6.8%) of the 103 cases with pernio were long-haulers with pernio lasting for more than 60 days, of whom 2 cases were laboratory-confirmed. One long-hauler patient who presented with 20 days of cough and fatigue and 13 days of pernio lesions initially tested negative for COVID-19 by SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal PCR, serum IgM, and IgG. The patient seroconverted to anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM positivity within 6 weeks after pernio onset and continued to experience severe pernio and fatigue for over 133 days (detailed case timeline is shown on appendix p 2). Additional ELISA-based testing of banked serum drawn 24 days after symptom onset showed IgA reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 full spike protein and spike protein receptor binding domain, consistent with reported IgA immunoreactivity detected in other COVID-19-associated cohorts of patients with pernio (appendix p 3). This finding increases our confidence that this patient had a true SARS-CoV-2 infection. Another long-hauler patient who developed pernio and livedo reticularis one month after exposure to a SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal PCR-positive family member tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 serum IgG one month after pernio lesion onset, and continued to experience pernio and livedo reticularis lesions for over 150 days.

A limitation of this registry-based study is that providers might have entered data at only one timepoint, often soon after seeing the patient, when the full-time course of disease had not yet been observed. We attempted to overcome this issue by proactively requesting case updates. This challenge probably biased our results towards inclusion of cases with a shorter duration of dermatological signs and symptoms. Indeed, 58% of providers reported that patients had ongoing COVID-19 dermatological manifestations at the time of case entry. Therefore, the duration of dermatological manifestations reported here probably underestimates both average duration and the number of long-hauler patients.

Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, appreciation for persistent morbidity beyond the acute phase of disease has increased. To our knowledge, our data represent the largest dataset to date on persistent skin signs and symptoms of COVID-19 and the duration for several distinct skin manifestations. Urticarial and morbilliform eruptions were relatively ephemeral, whereas papulosquamous eruptions, and particularly pernio, were longer-lasting. Our analysis revealed a previously unreported subset of patients who experience long-hauler symptoms in dermatology-dominant COVID-19, raising questions about persistent inflammation even in patients who initially experienced relatively mild COVID-19.

[Multiple skin manifestations have been described in patients with confirmed or suspected severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. These include a morbilliform rash; urticaria; pernio-like, acral lesions; livedo-like, vascular lesions; and vesicular, varicella-like eruptions. A severe multisystem inflammatory syndrome with mucocutaneous, systemic, laboratory, and imaging findings of atypical, severe Kawasaki disease has also been reported in children and adolescents with COVID-19; https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-cutaneous-manifestations-and-issues-related-to-dermatologic-care/print.

Genovese et al have proposed a classification, based on the polymorphic nature of COVID-19-associated cutaneous manifestations, which distinguishes 6 main clinical and histopathological patterns: (i) urticarial rash, (ii) confluent erythematous/maculopapular /morbilliform rash, (iii) papulovesicular exanthem, (iv) chilblain-like acral pattern, (v) livedo reticularis/racemosa-like pattern, (vi) purpuric "vasculitic" pattern [https://www. karger.com/Article /Fulltext/512932].

Telemedicine provides an opportunity to provide care while reducing risk for exposure of clinicians, staff, and patients to individuals with COVID-19. Both synchronous (e.g., simultaneous, 2-way communication between the patient and clinician via telephone or videoconferencing) and asynchronous (e.g., store-and-forward transmission of images for later assessment by the clinician) modalities have been used for tele-dermatology care [101]. A structured triage process may be helpful for identifying patients who require in-person, rather than a telemedicine visit.

In-person visits should be performed with appropriate infection control precautions. This typically includes at least patient screening and use of appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE). Although the risk of transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) through procedures such as dermoscopy remains unclear, clinicians should be cognizant about the potential for transmission through equipment that may come into contact with multiple patients [https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-cutaneous-manifestations-and-issues-related-to-dermatologic-care/print#H1181096409. - Mod.UBA]

[In the past 24 hours, the USA (202 767), Brazil (62 452), and UK (41 346) have reported the highest numbers of cases. A global total of 12 634 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (late 15 Jan to late 16 Jan 2021).

Countries reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours (15 countries) include the USA, Brazil, UK, Russia (24 092), Mexico (21 366), France (21 406), Colombia (20 855), Italy (16 310), India (15 051), Germany (14 844), Indonesia (14 224), South Africa (13 973), and Portugal (10 947). A total of 51 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 24 of the 51 countries that reported more than 1000 newly confirmed cases are from the European region, 12 are from the Americas region, 6 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 2 are from the South East Asia region, 3 are from the Western Pacific region, and 4 from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased by 4.6%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 4.1%.

Impression: The global daily reported cases are over 600 000 newly confirmed infections daily in the past 24 hours and over 94.94 million cumulative reported cases with over 2.03 million reported deaths. Countries in the European and the Americas regions are still showing the largest increases in daily new case counts. Africa has been showing increases over the last few weeks with now 3-4 countries reporting over 1000 cases per day. China has been reporting over 100 new cases per day for 6 out of the last 7 days. It is too early to tell whether the major lockdowns in Europe are impacting transmission. - Mod.UBA]
