The Ministry of Health [MoH] released information today [18 Sep 2014] about 19 historical (old) cases of MERS-CoV [Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus], as part of an ongoing review of patient data. Each of these cases had a date of onset prior to [3 Jun 2014].

Since launching a comprehensive response to MERS-CoV earlier this year [2014], the number of [new] reported cases in Saudi Arabia has declined dramatically.

Other aspects of MoH response include public health education, new procedures and equipment to quickly identify and treat patients and promotion of best practice to prevent the spread of MERS-CoV between healthcare workers.

The new information was discovered during an ongoing validation process designed to ensure the accuracy of MERS-CoV historical infection data. The review, undertaken by an independent auditor, is part of MoH's effort to minimize data discrepancies, with the goal of capturing information that enables healthcare workers to better control the disease.

MoH is conducting a retrospective analysis that includes a case-by-case review to better understand how to capture patient data in a more timely and complete way. It has also stepped up efforts to communicate to healthcare workers the requirement for quick and accurate reporting of infectious disease information. The new data has been shared with the World Health Organization.

Many of the additional cases were identified through a review of patient records at hospitals that perform on-site laboratory testing. All but 3 of the cases were in Jeddah.

Further revisions to the overall MERS-CoV statistics include:
1. The status of 18 cases was changed from active to recovered, while the categorization of 3 cases was changed from active to deceased
2. One duplicate case was identified and deleted
3. In addition, 2 cases reported [9 Jun and 26 Aug 2014] were subsequently identified as a false positive and have been removed from the statistics.

This effort complements the on-going implementation of the Health Electronic Surveillance Network (HESN), a comprehensive, integrated public health information system that helps public health workers collaborate to manage individual cases, outbreaks, immunizations, and medical inventories. Regular reviews are part of the MoH effort to introduce internationally accepted standards for due diligence, and can result in changes to reporting statistics arising from reclassification, retrospective investigation, consolidation of cases and laboratory data, and enhanced surveillance outcome.

In total, MoH had identified 748 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV as of [18 Sep 2014].

[The Saudi MOH is to be commended for its transparency and efforts to improve the knowledge base on the MERS-CoV. In summary, the retrospective review/audit of surveillance data and patient records has resulted in a net increase of 16 retrospectively identified laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV infected individuals and 14 deaths among laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV infected individuals. This retrospective review and reclassification of status of cases also resulted in an increase of 25 MERS-CoV confirmed individuals who have recovered, and resulting in a decrease of 23 individuals from the active case count. As of yesterday, 18 Sep 2014, there were a total of 748 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection identified in Saudi Arabia since June 2012, including 316 deaths, 424 recovered cases and 8 cases under treatment. As of today, 19 Sep 2014, with the addition of the newly confirmed case in Taif (see below), the tally has increased to 749 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection, including 9 cases currently under treatment. - Mod.MPP]

[With the commendable retrospective review of MERS-CoV cases and surveillance information, and the addition of the newly reported laboratory-confirmed case of MERS-CoV infection in Taif, the total number of MERS-CoV infections confirmed in Saudi Arabia since the 1st case occurred in June 2012 is now 749 cases including 316 deaths. Of interest, this is now the 3rd case confirmed in Taif this month (September 2014), although the 1st case to have a history of exposure to animals. Of note is that Taif is located in Makkah province, where millions of pilgrims will be gathering in less than a month. The number of cases of MERS-CoV infection confirmed this month is now up to 7, with 3 from Taif, 2 from Riyadh, 1 from Najran, and 1 from Jubail.
