8 of the rarest type of kiwi have died from a respiratory tract infection at Wellington Zoo.

The young rowi, who had been living on predator-free Motuara Island in the Marlborough Sounds, were being treated for a type of worm at the zoo when they started showing signs of respiratory problems, thought to be caused by the bark they were being housed on. Biodiversity manager Jo Macpherson said the bark was regularly used by the zoo with no adverse effects, and the birds' weakened immunity had made them more susceptible to the illness.

The respiratory tract infection was caused by a fungus called _Aspergillus_ spp which is common to the natural environment but can cause severe damage to the lungs and air sacs in birds. "This is an extremely rare and unfortunate occurrence and has come as a great blow," she said.

Macpherson said it a difficult disease to treat and the zoo and DOC [Department of Conservation] staff are devastated by the loss. "It is also a tragic loss for 'Kiwis for kiwi', who have supported the rowi programme and have been an integral player in the return of 200 rowi back to the wild."

With fewer than 400 of the birds remaining, DOC has been working to bring rowi back from the brink using BNZ [Bank of New Zealand] Operation Nest Egg.

Unmanaged, a tiny proportion of rowi survive to adulthood -- around 95 per cent are killed by stoats [short-tailed weasels].

"These birds were removed from the wild as eggs in order to protect them while they grew big enough to defend themselves," said Macpherson.

The kiwi had been transferred from the Marlborough Sounds to the zoo last month [September 2013] for specialist treatment.

The zoo's veterinary science manager, Lisa Argilla, said the 1st kiwi died on [11 Sep 2013], after which the remaining kiwi were removed from the enclosure.

Despite treatment for the respiratory infection, 7 further kiwi died over the month.

"It was one of those races against time, we needed the birds to hold on a little bit longer for the drugs to do their work... but everything was against them once they got the disease; it's notoriously difficult to treat especially when they're stressed."

Wellington Zoo chief executive Karen Fifield said she was satisfied staff had acted quickly once they saw signs of respiratory infection.

These animals were "in some way... compromised when they came," she said. "Their stress levels are different, things affect them more than they would a healthy animal. It's not excusing what happened and weasel[ing] out of it, but you do have to take even more precaution when dealing with animals like this."

Fifield said the bark was old and weathered so it was unusual for it to contain the spores which are thought to have caused the infection.

The zoo would be working with DOC on the protocol for working with endangered animals to assess how deaths like these could be prevented, including looking at whether or not it would continue to use the bark.

An unrelated kiwi death occurred at Massey University, for which the department is awaiting autopsy results.

[The mold _Aspergillus_ spp cause a common fungal infection in birds resulting in respiratory illness. Birds are commonly exposed to the spores of this fungus but only develop the respiratory disease under certain conditions. Aspergillosis may be induced by stress.

The rowi, or Okarito kiwi (_Apteryx rowi_) was described as new to science in 2003. The species is part of the brown kiwi complex, and is morphologically very similar to other members of that complex. It is found in a restricted area of the Okarito forest on the West Coast of New Zealand's South Island, and has a population of only a few hundred birds.
