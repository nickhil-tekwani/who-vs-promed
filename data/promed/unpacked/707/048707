The latest OIE avian influenza report mentioned that: "In Europe, the 1st outbreaks of HPAI H5N8 were reported in August 2020 in Russia, in both poultry and wild birds. Since then, a new wave of epizootic outbreaks of H5N8 has been continuously reported in several European countries especially in wild birds, but also in poultry starting from mid-October [2020]. The H5N8 virus has also reassorted with other wild bird influenza viruses to form new strains of H5N5 and H5N1 HPAI virus, which were also reported by countries. There has been continued virus change by genetic reassortment in wild birds resulting in other H5 subtypes like H5N3 and H5N4 also reported by few countries in the current epidemic wave."

"To summarize, the current HPAI H5 epidemic is still progressing in Europe, Asia, and Africa causing severe impact due to dead and culled birds in the infected premises. It is more likely that the source of introduction in these outbreaks is through migratory wild birds and onward local spread. A similar situation of H5N8 epizootics associated with wild bird migration occurred in 2016/17. Report of increased number of outbreaks in wild birds indicate periods of heightened risk in countries due to migratory flyways during this season. Consequently, improving on-farm biosecurity measures is a priority to reduce the likelihood of exposure to poultry.

"Veterinary Authorities in the affected countries have responded to contain outbreaks in poultry with stamping out measures, heightened surveillance, and recommendations to poultry owners to increase biosecurity".

As was mentioned in ProMED-mail posting 20210205.8166203, given the presence HPAI H5N8 in the region, there is a high likelihood that this recent outbreak reported by Bulgaria is also associated with this same subtype.

To date, no human cases of infection with HPAI H5N8 have been reported. - Mod.CRD]
