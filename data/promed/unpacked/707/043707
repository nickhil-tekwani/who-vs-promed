---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Crown rust of barley, caused by _Puccinia coronata_ var. _hordei_ (Pch), has so far only been reported in Hungary and the US. In China, stripe, stem, and leaf rusts have been reported on barley. Recently, a rust sample collected from barley appeared different from these with respect to colour, size, and arrangements of fungal structures. Based on the disease symptoms and morphology of urediniospores and teliospores, the fungus was identified as _P. coronata_ var. _hordei_.

PCR analysis was carried out with primers derived from previous Hungarian and US isolates and specific to Pch. Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of resulting amplicons found that the Chinese isolates from barley and buckthorn (_Rhamnus_ sp.) clustered in one clade with Pch isolates from barley and the grass _Elymus repens_ but in a different clade from varieties of _P. coronata_ from oats and grasses.

At the seedling stage, most of the tested cultivars of barley and rye were susceptible to the 2 Chinese Pch isolates, but cultivars of oats, triticale, wheat, and most grasses in genera _Aegilops_, _Brachypodium_, _Bromus_, _Calamagrostis_, _Deschampsia_, _Elymus_, _Festuca_, and _Phleum_ were resistant. This indicates a host specialisation of the Chinese isolates on barley.

[Both the oat and barley crown rust pathogens have now been classified as pathovars (variant strains) of the same fungal species, _Puccinia coronata_. In addition to their respective crop hosts, each can also infect a number of grasses. The strains do not cross into each other's host range. Orange spores are produced within pustules on leaves and sheaths. Severe crown rust epidemics have been reported in oat with yield losses of 40% or even total crop loss. The diseases are favoured by warm and humid weather.

Rust spores are wind dispersed over long distances. They can also be spread by mechanical means (human or insect activities) and on contaminated materials (equipment, clothing, crop debris). The life cycle of _P. coronata_ includes species of buckthorn (_Rhamnus_) or alder buckthorn (_Frangula_) as obligate alternate hosts. Part of the rust life cycle needs to be completed on these before the pathogen can infect its original grassy host again.

Disease management may include timely fungicide applications, cultural methods, and use of resistant crop varieties. Eradication of reservoirs and alternate hosts within about 2 km [1.2 mi] of the cereal fields has been recommended for oat, but this may be impossible in some areas. Early discovery of infection is important so action can be taken to limit pathogen spread as well as build-up of inoculum.
