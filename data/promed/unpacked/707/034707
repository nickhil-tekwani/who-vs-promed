Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever and dengue in Pakistan
------------------------------------------------------
As of Fri 15 Oct 2010, the IHR [International Health Regulations]
National Focal Point, Ministry of Health (MoH), Pakistan, has notified
WHO of 26 cases, including 3 deaths, of Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic
fever (CCHF).

Both CCHF and dengue fever are endemic in Pakistan with seasonal rise
in cases. However, recently, the transmission of both CCHF and dengue
fever has intensified in the country with increased incidence and
geographic expansion. The recent floods in Pakistan may have
contributed to this upsurge as a result of changes in risk factors for
these diseases.

Operational response
--------------------
The MoH has scaled up response activities to prevent and mitigate CCHF
and dengue fever, including awareness-raising campaigns on exposure
risks and preventive measures for the general public, strengthening
clinical and case management of patients with haemorrhagic fevers,
stockpiling appropriate drugs and personal protective equipment, and
implementing targeted vector control activities.

Upon request from the MoH in Pakistan, WHO is mobilizing experts in
the clinical management of severe dengue fever and in infection
control in health care settings through the Global Outbreak Alert and
Response Network (GOARN). WHO is also assisting the country with
resource mobilization, strengthening disease surveillance, laboratory
diagnostics, and training of health care providers.

For more information on these diseases see the WHO CCHF website
(<http://www.who.int/csr/disease/crimean_congoHF/en/index.html>), and
the WHO Dengue/dengue haemorrhagic fever website
(<http://www.who.int/csr/disease/dengue/en/index.html>).

[CCHF and dengue fever viruses are responsible for haemorrhagic
fevers. Such diseases may be difficult to distinguish on clinical
grounds initially. However CCHF virus and dengue fever virus are
biologically distinct being transmitted by arachnids (ticks) in the
case of CCHF virus and by insects (mosquitoes) in the case of dengue
virus. Hopefully the intervention of the WHO will improve facilities
in Pakistan for the diagnosis of the disease caused by these viruses.
