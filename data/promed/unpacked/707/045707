Netanya mystery: hundreds of dead fish found on beach
-----------------------------------------------------
Visitors to the beach of the Israel Nature and Parks Authority at
South Poleg, near Netanya, were surprised to see hundreds of dead fish
lying on the sand. Authorities are trying to determine whether fish
died from infection or disease.

The Director of beaches in Netanya, Zion Sadeh, confirmed the details
and told Walla News that "South Poleg beach was covered by hundreds
of dead fish. At 1st we thought it was poisoning or contamination of
the water and told authorities to check. We are not accustomed to such
spectacles."

The affected fish are reportedly rabbitfish _Siganus luridus_,
originally a Red Sea species introduced into the Mediterranean through
the Suez Canal, usually found mainly in the reefs.

The tests are meant to enable defining the etiology of the event:
water contamination or by a virus.

Netanya Municipality stated that the issue is being examined by the
authorities.
