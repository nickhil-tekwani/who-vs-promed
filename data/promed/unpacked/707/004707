The Minister of Health, Guillermo Maza, confirmed this morning [20
Sep 2006] another fatal case of dengue. An 11-month-old infant was
victim number 4 in the epidemic this year. The child, who came from
the Mejicanos Municipality, died 1 Aug [2006] in the Benjamin Bloom
Children's Hospital.
The Minister emphasized the role of the population in eradication of
dengue and that it was vital that the number of cases of this disease
did not increase.
Official statistics indicate that 195 people have had DHF and 6497
have had classical dengue fever this year [2006]. At present, 3
departments [state equivalents Mod.TY] are under "red alert:"
Sonsonate, La Libertad y San Salvador, due to a significant increase
in dengue cases and especially DHF.
Nonetheless, [Minister] Mazo indicated that there has been a decrease
in cases and discarded the need to take stronger measures to combat
mosquito breeding places in Santa Ana and San Vicente, which have not
reported an increase in cases in recent days.
The Epidemiological surveillance report indicates that 17 244
suspected classical dengue fever cases and 316 [suspected] DHF cases
have received medical attention [this year 2006].

Ribeirao Preto [Sao Paulo State] is 3rd in dengue cases
-----------------------------------------------
Ribeirao Preto, with 3283 cases of dengue, is experiencing the worst
epidemic of this disease in its history. In the ranking of the State
Secretary of Health, this city occupies 3rd place after Catanduva and
Sao Jose do Rio Preto. According to data collected as of 8 Sep
[2006], Ribeirao Preto had 2888 cases, versus 3055 in Catanduva, and
7841 in Rio Preto.
Due to the seriousness of the situation, the Municipal Secretary of
Health, Oswaldo Cruz Franco, issued this alert, "The situation is
very dangerous. The population has not eliminated [mosquito] breeding
sites, and when the rains begin, we run the risk that the epidemic
will become worse.
A Breteau [vector] survey will begin in October 2006. The Division of
Vector Control intends to initiate, in the 2nd half of October 2006,
the year's 2nd Breteau index [BI] survey in Ribeirao Preto. This
indicator measures the number of [containers harboring] dengue vector
mosquito larvae [_Aedes aegypti_] for each 100 premises [inspected]
and is important for officials working to prevent or combat dengue.
In July 2006, when the 1st survey was made, Ribeirao Preto had an
index of 2.3, considered high by [the standards set by] the World
Health Organization, which sets limits at 0 to 1.
Jardim Recreio and Lagoinha lideram had BIs of 5.2 and 5.1,
respectively. Alto da Boa Vista and Sumare, in the south region, had
BIs of 4.5.

Dengue Deaths in Dominican Republic
-------------------------------------------
The dengue epidemic ravaging the Dominican Republic has raised the
death toll to 37 and filled hospital emergency rooms, although health
authorities say it is declining.
Two additional people died this weekend, a man of 33 and a 6-year-old
girl, but officially neither death has been confirmed as dengue yet.
The State Health Secretary, Bautista Rojas, insisted that the trend
[in dengue cases] is decreasing, since of 2180 patients that have
received [medical] attention Saturday [23 Sep 2006] up to early on
Sunday [24 Sep 2006] in the capital, only 38 have been considered
[dengue] infected.
With this last figure, cases reported by hospitals rose to 3562,
despite a national campaign to eliminate the 2.5 million possible
sources of the mosquito _Aedes aegypti_, the transmitter of this disease.

The Cuban government today [24 Sep 2006] confirmed that dengue is a
resurgent public health problem, and that they have not been able to
stop the life cycle of the vector, but maintain silence about the
numbers of cases and the area affected by this disease.
The interim President, Raul Castro, headed up a meeting of provincial
governors, some of whom criticized the status of the massive battle
in recent weeks. [The government] will not rest until this dangerous
vector has been eradicated, according to today's [23 Sep 2006]
official daily newspaper, Granma. This newspaper indicated that the
Minister of Health, Jose Ramon Balaguer, reported [on the outbreak],
but did not report what he said.

26-81 percent of dengue cases in RP unreported - study
-----------------------------------------------
A new study revealed that the reported dengue incidence in the
Philippines constitutes only a fraction of the actual cases. The
study, entitled the "Burden of Disease and Economic Impact of
Dengue," conducted by the University of the Philippines' College of
Public Health, showed that 81 percent of dengue cases in the country
are unreported, while those monitored have logical inconsistencies in
reports from various sources of health data.
The study reviewed monitoring results of the National Epidemic
Sentinel Surveillance System (NESSS) from 248 sentinel hospitals and
the data from the Field Health Surveillance Information System
(FHIS), both by the Department of Health's National Epidemiological
Center (NEC), likewise data from the serologic confirmatory tests
done by the St. Luke's Hospital on blood specimens from 4367
suspected dengue cases and various documents pertinent to the dengue
prevention and control program of LGUs and at the national level.
It cited NEC's FHSIS and NESSS 2004 report which revealed some
inconsistencies. The FHSIS reported a total of 19 067 cases, while
the NESSS reported 22 828 hospitalized cases. "Logically, the number
of cases should be more than the hospitalized cases," the study pointed out.
The study also cited that many cases are clinically diagnosed without
the benefit of confirmatory tests. The same study disclosed that even
the serological test that is commonly used has relatively low
sensitivity (77 percent) and specificity (76 percent) and takes an
average of 4 days before the results are available.
NEC Director Dr. Eric Tayag, however, maintained that this is not the
reason why dengue cases are lower this year 2006. He added that
dengue shows a wide spectrum of ailments, some of which are
asymptomatic, so many cases go unnoticed or undiagnosed, partly
because many patients choose to ignore the innocent symptoms of
dengue, one of which could be a mild fever. He said that the UP study
is a review from consultations in hospitals, wherein they found out
that, for example, only 19 in 100 dengue cases were reported. "We are
only seeing the tip of the iceberg," he said. For example, Tayag
said, if there are 16 000 dengue cases at any given time, there are
actually hundreds of thousands of dengue cases left unreported.
Proponents of the study, meanwhile, have called on the government to
enhance the country's health information system. "If indeed the key
to action is early detection and valid reporting, then there is no
need to improve and harmonize the health information system perhaps
through actual implementation of the Department of Health (DoH)
comprehensive surveillance system that covers clinical, laboratory,
epidemiological and vector surveillance," Dr. Fely Marilyn Lorenzo, a
professor from the University of the Philippines-Manila said.

[Quantifying mild or inapparent dengue cases is a daunting challenge.
Infections not resulting in visits to health providers usually go
undetected and, hence, unreported. The kinds of prospective studies
required to accrue this information, such as the study of school
children in Thailand reported at last year's [2005] meeting of the
American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, require monitoring
of large numbers of people and are labor-intensive and expensive.
However, studies like that one are necessary to determine incidence
of infection and ratios of clinical to inapparent infections, and to
associate severity of disease with the infecting virus strain and
serotype and with prior immune status of the individual infected.
WHO describes dengue fever as a severe, flu-like illness that affects
infants, young children, and adults, but seldom causes death. The
clinical features of dengue fever vary according to the age of the
patient. Infants and young children may have a non-specific febrile
illness with rash (although some infants and very young children may
develop shock syndrome, with sudden loss of circulating fluid volume,
and die). Older children and adults may have either a mild febrile
syndrome or the classical incapacitating disease, with abrupt onset
and high fever, severe headache, pain behind the eyes, muscle and
joint pains, and rash.
Dengue hemorrhagic fever is a potentially deadly complication that is
characterized by high fever, hemorrhagic phenomena -- often with
enlargement of the liver -- and in severe cases, circulatory failure.
The illness commonly begins with a sudden rise in temperature
accompanied by facial flush and other non-specific constitutional
symptoms of dengue fever. The fever usually continues for 2 to 7 days
and can be as high as 40-41 C [104-105.8 F], possibly with febrile
convulsions and hemorrhagic phenomena. In moderate DHF cases, all
signs and symptoms abate after the fever subsides. In severe cases,
the patient's condition may suddenly deteriorate after a few days of
fever; the temperature drops, followed by signs of circulatory
failure, and the patient may rapidly go into a critical state of
shock and die within 12-24 hours or quickly recover following
appropriate volume replacement therapy. There is no specific
treatment for dengue fever. However, careful clinical management by
experienced physicians and nurses frequently saves the lives of DHF
patients. With appropriate intensive supportive therapy, mortality
may be reduced to less than one percent. Maintenance of the
circulating fluid volume is the central feature of DHF case management.
