Regulators and safety officials should look closely at a vaccine
reported to be causing a few calves fed colostrum to bleed to death,
Green Party MP Sue Kedgley says. The fact that some babies are fed cow
colostrum, a form of milk rich in antibodies, means the checks should
be made, she said.

Multinational agrichemical company Pfizer Animal Health yesterday [26
Aug 2011] said it was "not aware" of a risk to human health from dairy
ingredients or veal potentially compromised by the PregSure BVD
vaccine, used on almost a million New Zealand dairy cows.

Five confirmed and 2 suspected cases of bleeding calf syndrome linked
to vaccinations with PregSure have been reported in New Zealand, the
1st on 18 Aug 2011.

"If the colostrum caused the damage in the calves, could it also be
causing problems in humans?" said Ms Kedgley. She asked whether there
had been adequate consideration of the potential human health impacts
by either regulators or the pharmaceutical company. "I would want to
know whether food safety officials or dairy companies such as Fonterra
knew last year [2010] that the vaccine had been withdrawn from sale
throughout Europe," she said. "Did they know about it, and could
humans be affected by the same reaction to the colostrum?" she said.
"If calves are developing the disease from the milk provided by their
vaccinated mothers, what potential risk is there for humans?"

In some cows, the vaccine is reported to have triggered changes that
affected their colostrum, and a small proportion of calves drinking
that milk apparently suffered an immune reaction and bled to death
after their bone marrow was destroyed.

Pfizer pulled the PregSure BVD vaccine from the New Zealand market on
Wednesday [24 Aug 2011], 14 months after it stopped sales of the
vaccine in all European markets in June 2010, and even earlier in
parts of Germany, which was worst-affected by "bleeding calf
syndrome," recently renamed bovine neonatal pancytopenia (BNP).

"Independently conducted research suggests that the consumption of
colostrum by the calf may be a key triggering event for the occurrence
of BNP," Pfizer said.

New Zealand dairy farmers harvest colostrum milk and sell it for high
prices to be used in human pharmaceuticals, and health foods, and
unwanted male "bobby calves" are sent to meatworks in their 1st couple
of weeks of life. "We are not aware of any evidence of any risk to
human health in respect of humans who have consumed colostrum from
vaccinated cows or calves sold as vealers," the US-based company
said.

Pfizer said it had acted "responsibly", and the exact cause of
bleeding calf syndrome was not known and could involve multiple
factors. The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF) said it had
been working with Pfizer since the 1st local case was reported, and
the company had fulfilled all its regulatory obligations.

"MAF is not aware of any evidence of a risk to human health, but we
will continue to review the information from the European Union and
other sources," said Debbie Morris, director of MAF's veterinary
medicines arm. The vaccine had been used without any reports of calves
bleeding to death in a number of countries outside Europe, including
New Zealand. "Until 18 Aug 2011, there were no reported cases of BNP
in New Zealand and, therefore, no basis on which to remove the product
from the New Zealand market," she said.

A spokesman for Fonterra said it was working with regulatory
authorities and seeking further information from Pfizer on the vaccine
implicated in the deaths of calves.

[It is interesting to note that the company pulled the vaccine in
Europe in 2010 but waited to pull the vaccine in New Zealand until
this month. Given the situation with the colostrum, one has to wonder
whether the company has done adequate safety testing on the colostrum
itself. - Mod.TG
