Request for information from veterinary epidemiologists, laboratory
scientists, and field veterinarians
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Although rinderpest disease has been eradicated, existing vaccine and
virus stocks continue to present a risk of re-emergence. For this
reason, FAO has commissioned the Royal Veterinary College and AusVet
to conduct a risk assessment. This information will be essential for
national authorities, FAO, and OIE to manage existing vaccine and
virus efficiently.

We are asking all government epidemiologists, senior laboratory
staff, and field veterinarians to complete a confidential survey,
which should take a few minutes and is available in several different
languages. We will not pass on any information that identifies you
without obtaining your permission first.

The password for all surveys is: morbillivirus.

To access the survey for government epidemiologists, click
http://survey.ausvet.com.au/index.php?sid=39887.
To access the survey for senior laboratory staff (private, government
or NGO), click http://survey.ausvet.com.au/index.php?sid=56755.
To access the survey for field veterinarians (those involved in
national or regional livestock disease control programmes), click
http://survey.ausvet.com.au/index.php?sid=92742.

The deadline is 6 Jun 2011.

Many thanks,
