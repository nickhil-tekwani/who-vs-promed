Why are the deer dying in Ashland?
----------------------------------
State wildlife biologists are trying to uncover why seemingly healthy
black-tailed deer are dying in droves within Ashland's city limits.

At least a dozen healthy-looking deer have died in city backyards in
the past 2 weeks, prompting Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife
(ODFW) biologist Steve Niemela to seek lab tests for diagnoses. Field
necropsies done on 2 deer this week [week of 8 Dec 2008] revealed
that these animals did not die from ruminitis, a disease killing
Jacksonville-area deer that were fatally fed corn by residents there,
Niemela said. "They had lots of fat and looked like healthy animals,
but were dead," Niemela said.

Organ-tissue samples from 2 deer found dead Tuesday [9 Dec 2008] were
shipped Wednesday [10 Dec 2008] to the ODFW's veterinarians for
tests. One of those 2 deer showed possible signs of the adenovirus, a
highly contagious disease that earlier this decade wiped out deer
around Ashland, Jacksonville, and other areas where the animals had
unnaturally concentrated because some people were feeding them. One
of the dead deer was a fawn with a plastic grocery bag in its
stomach, Niemela said. Niemela said it was premature to conclude the
adenovirus has resurfaced here. "Hopefully the lab will give us a
better diagnosis," he said.

Public works crews occasionally get calls to remove dead members of
Ashland's bountiful herd of "city deer" that regularly roams
neighborhoods, Lithia Park, and even the Southern Oregon University
campus, said utility worker Dan Gunter. But calls came in regularly
starting last week [week of 1 Dec 2008], with 2 in 2 days and 4 on
Friday, he said. "4 in one day? That was unheard of for us," Gunter
said. "Their fur was in good shape and healthy-looking, but they were dead."

Some of the deaths were gruesome, residents said. For 3 days last
week, a doe stayed bedded down near Al Alsing's house in the 900
block of Walker Avenue, 3 blocks above the boulevard. "I left her
there and could see she wasn't getting anywhere," Alsing said. "It
was healthy, up to that point." The last day, the doe was convulsing,
Alsing said. He telephoned Ashland police, and an officer shot it, he
said. Alsing said he knows of no neighbors who feed the deer.

Jacksonville residents placing food and water out for blacktails were
blamed in 2001 for the state's 1st documented outbreak of the
so-called adenovirus hemorrhagic disease. The virus attacks the
deer's mouth and/or digestive tract, causing a bloody diarrhea that
can scour the animal or mouth lesions that keep it from feeding. A
deer can catch the virus simply by breathing air from an infected
animal. Humans and pets are not considered at risk. While the
adenovirus has similar strains affecting cattle and sheep, there are
no known instances of the virus spreading from deer to other animals.
ODFW state veterinarian Collin Gillin said the known adenovirus
outbreaks in Oregon typically occur in Southern Oregon and around
Bend. "Any scenario where folks are feeding really increases the
chances of it," Gillin said. "I wish people would stop it."

[Metropolitan deer, presumably whitetails, are a very different
population from their wild brethren. As no signs are reported along
with these deaths, other than "convulsions," which could be almost
anything, the question remains open until further necropsy reports
are released. By the numbers reported there will be ample animals for
examination. However, I would point out that until the cause is
better delineated moribund animals should not be put down by shooting
them in the head. It makes brain tissue examinations difficult to say
the least. Any guidance from informed members would be appreciated. - Mod.MHJ
