[For additional background information, including diagnostic methods and references, please refer to OIE Terrestrial Manual 2016, Chapter 2.6.2 "Rabbit haemorrhagic disease", from which the following commentary is quoted, (http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.06.02_RHD.pdf; adopted by the World Assembly of Delegates of the OIE in May 2016):

Rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD) is a highly contagious and fatal hepatitis of wild and domestic European rabbits (_Oryctolagus cuniculus_). RHD is caused by a calicivirus (genus _Lagovirus_, family Caliciviridae), a nonenveloped small round RNA virus with only one major capsid protein (VP60). The genus _Lagovirus_ also includes the European brown hare syndrome virus (EBHSV), the causative agent of a disease of brown hare (_Lepus europaeus_) termed EBHS, very similar to RHD. Despite their high genetic relationship (VP60 nucleotide similarity of 70 percent), RHDV and EBHSV are 2 distinct viral species.

Genetic and antigenic comparison and epidemiological data indicate the existence of 3 main RHDV groups:
i) The "classical RHDV", including genogroups G1-G5, first reported in China (People's Rep. of) in 1984. To date, this RHDV has been reported in over 40 countries in Asia, Africa, Americas, Europe, and Oceania and is endemic in most parts of the world where European rabbits live naturally or are domesticated.

ii) The subtype RHDVa/G6 identified in Europe on 1996 and currently reported in other continents (Oceania, Asia, and Americas).

iii) The "new" RHDV (provisionally called RHDV2 or RHDVb) emerged in France in 2010 in wild and farmed vaccinated rabbits, and rapidly spread in Europe and the Mediterranean basin (Malta and Tunisia), and also in Australia in 2015. According to Le Gall-Recul√© et al. (2013), RHDV2 did not derive from classical RHDV, but rather it originated as a 2nd emergence of unknown origin. Antigenic and disease protection data led to it being classified RHDV2 as a second RHDV serotype.

RHD is characterised by high morbidity but a variable proportion of rabbits die according to the type of virus. The incubation period of RHDV/RHDVa is 1-3 days, and death usually occurs 12-36 hours after the onset of fever (80-90 percent lethality). Around 5-10 percent of rabbits show a subacute-chronic clinical course. Although rabbits of all ages can be infected, the infection is subclinical in animals younger than 6-8 weeks of age. The disease caused by RHDV2 has typical features: the mortality rate is lower but highly variable (5-70 percent) with an average mortality of 20 percent in experimentally infected rabbits; death occurs in lactating rabbits from 15 days of age onwards and the course of the diseases is usually longer (3-5 days), with higher proportion of rabbits showing subacute-chronic disease. In addition, RHDV2 is able to cause an RHD-like disease in two hare species: Cape hare (_Lepus capensis_ var. _mediterraneus_) and Italian hare (_Lepus corsicanus_).

Indirect control of the disease is easily achieved by vaccination. Although the capsid RHDVs has been expressed as recombinant VPLs, as of 2015 the vaccines used are inactivated vaccine prepared from livers of experimentally infected rabbits, and thus inactivated and adjuvanted. Vaccinated animals quickly produce solid protective immunity against RHDV infection (within 7-10 days) and experimental data indicate that protection lasts for a long period (over 1 year). As RHDV2 is a distant antigenic subtype or even a second RHDV serotype combined vaccination with both antigenic types or the use of a vaccine homologous to the RHDV strain identified during the epidemics or the outbreak, is highly advisable."
