CDC is collaborating with public health officials in multiple states across
the USA and with the Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection
Service (USDA/FSIS) to investigate an ongoing multistate outbreak of
_Salmonella_ I 4,[5],12:i:- (pronounced "four five twelve eye minus")
infections in humans. An investigation that used interviews comparing foods
eaten by ill and well persons is showing that eating Banquet brand pot pies
produced by the ConAgra Foods company is the likely source of the illness.

Between 1 Jan 2007 and 29 Oct 2007, at least 272 isolates of _Salmonella_ I
4,[5],12:i:- with an indistinguishable genetic fingerprint have been
collected from ill persons in 35 states. Ill persons whose strain has this
genetic fingerprint have been reported from Arizona (1 person), Arkansas
(4), California (18), Colorado (9), Connecticut (7), Delaware (5), Florida
(2), Georgia (2), Idaho (11), Illinois (7), Indiana (3), Iowa (1), Kansas
(4), Kentucky (9), Massachusetts (7), Maryland (7), Maine (2), Michigan
(3), Minnesota (7), Missouri (18), Montana (6), Nevada (6), New York (10),
North Carolina (2), Ohio (11), Oklahoma (1), Oregon (4), Pennsylvania (18),
Tennessee (6), Texas (4), Utah (12), Virginia (9), Vermont (2), Washington
(27), Wisconsin (24), Wyoming (3). Their ages range from less than one to
89 years with a median age of 18 years; 51 per cent of ill persons are
female. At least 65 people have been hospitalized. No deaths have been
reported.

Investigation of the outbreak
-----------------------------
CDC coordinated a case-control study designed to identify the source of
these infections. For this study, a case was defined as salmonella
infection on or after 1 Aug 2007, with a strain that had the outbreak
genetic fingerprint. Eating a Banquet brand pot pie was significantly
associated with illness. State health departments are collecting and
testing pot pie products recovered from patients' homes. To date, 3
patients' pot pies have yielded _Salmonella_ I 4,[5],12:i:- isolates with a
genetic fingerprint indistinguishable from the outbreak pattern.

[CDC has stated that this posting is the last planned web update on this
outbreak. The total number of cases has increased by 24 in the 10 days
since CDC's last web update with cases in 35 states. It is not specifically
stated when the onsets of the latest reported cases were. The entire
report, which reproduces much about the outbreak previously posted, can be
