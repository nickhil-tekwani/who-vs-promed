[3] Mexico (Tijuana, Baja California): elevated mortality
Date: Fri 8 May 2020 11:08 PM PDT
Source: Reuters [edited]
https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-mexico-tijuana-ins/tijuana-coronavirus-death-rate-soars-after-hospital-outbreaks-idUSKBN22K2U6


The number of deaths from the coronavirus [COVID-19] in Mexico's best-known border city, Tijuana, has soared and the COVID-19 mortality rate is twice the national average, the health ministry says, after medical staff quickly fell ill as the outbreak rampaged through hospital wards. A floor at one of the city's main public hospitals has been left empty because so many workers are sick there are not enough left to care for patients, the hospital director said, despite people with COVID-19 symptoms lining up outside to get in for treatment.

More than 21% of patients who have tested positive for coronavirus in the city do not survive, health ministry data showed as of Thursday [7 May 2020]. In the rest of Mexico, the figure was just under 10%. While Tijuana's figure might be due partly to an unduly high proportion of very sick patients being tested for coronavirus, Alberto Reyes Escamilla, director of Tijuana General Hospital, said he thought it was directly linked to the hospital's personnel shortage.

"It has a lot to do with the fact that we don't have staff," he said, adding that about 500 of his 1200 person pre-pandemic staff are either off sick or furloughed because of vulnerability to the illness. "We have a floor that could hold 30 more patients, but we can't use it because I don't have the personnel," said Reyes, who heads one of 3 public hospitals treating coronavirus. The 2 other public hospitals in Tijuana that are treating coronavirus patients also had a large number of staff out sick but the agency running those clinics denied that the high death rate was due to staff shortages.

Tijuana is the municipality with the most deaths attributed to COVID-19 in Mexico, 243 so far, according to state and federal health department data. That is more than across the US border in San Diego, California, which has a similar population but 4 times as many confirmed cases.

Outside Tijuana's 3 coronavirus hospitals, patients line up for hours to enter, mingling with crowds of family members who wait for days for news about loved ones, according to nurses and a Reuters witness. Another doctor at Tijuana General, who asked not to be named because he was not authorized to speak to media, said the staffing shortage, especially of nurses, was forcing medics to concentrate on treating the most serious cases, risking allowing other COVID-19 patients' conditions to worsen in the meantime. However, some officials blamed the nature of the virus itself.

The Baja California state health department, which operates the hospital, did not respond to multiple requests for comment. In April [2020], state health secretary Alonso Oscar Perez acknowledged in public comments that staffing shortages had prevented the hospital from opening more beds. The 2 other coronavirus hospitals in the city are operated by the federal government's Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS). IMSS Baja California planning coordinator Clemente Martinez told Reuters nearly 14% of doctors at each of the IMSS hospitals in Tijuana had been sent home with coronavirus-related symptoms since the pandemic began, and that other high-risk doctors had been furloughed proactively.

He described the IMSS hospitals as having "a large number of workers who have been infected by the virus" but said Tijuana's high number of deaths was not caused by a staff shortage. "Does it mean that the disease's mortality or lethality increases? No. The disease's lethality is clear," he said. Last month [April 2020], Baja California governor Jaime Bonilla said doctors, many of whom work in both the state and federal system, were "dropping like flies" in Tijuana.

Mexico's national coronavirus mortality rate is already well above the global average, a result largely attributed to the country having the lowest testing rate in the OECD [Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development] group of developed nations, and a high incidence of obesity-related diseases. Alan Rafael Muro, an emergency room doctor who also works with the Mexican Red Cross in Tijuana, said deaths in the city were even higher than registered because some fatal victims with respiratory distress or other coronavirus-related symptoms were not reaching hospital.

"We're not even counting people who die in their homes," he said. Reuters witnessed Muro and fellow paramedics respond to multiple 911 calls within a 24-hour period where people they suspected of having COVID-19 were dead when help arrived. "It's 2 pm and we've already had 10 dead-on-arrival," he said. Deputy health minister Hugo Lopez-Gatell, who has spearheaded Mexico's response to the outbreak, told Reuters this week that the country's coronavirus death toll is higher than the official count which now stands at around 2900.

IMSS official Martinez said Tijuana was hard-hit by coronavirus earlier than the rest of Mexico because of proximity to the United States, but that mortality figures nationally would likely rise as the virus spreads throughout the interior. "Statistically that's what we expect, although I firmly hope it's not what happens, despite the statistics saying otherwise," Martinez said.

[Unfortunately, many common threads with other countries in terms of impact of insufficient surge capacity. While there is no mention of PPE (personal protective equipment), the high attack rate among hospital staff strongly suggests shortages of PPE for the healthcare workers. In yesterday's post (7 May 2020) there were articles of dire situations in Amazon cities in Peru and Brazil. The media is full of similar stories of locations in upper income countries as well as middle and lower income countries, and socioeconomic disparities in morbidity and mortality rates. - Mod.MPP

The composition of the committee was expanded to reflect the nature of the pandemic and the need to include additional areas of expertise. The director-general commended the committee members and advisers for their commitment to enhancing global public health and provided an overview of the major achievements in the COVID-19 response since the 2nd meeting on [30 Jan 2020]. The WHO regional emergency directors, and WHO Health Emergencies Programme executive director Dr Mike Ryan, provided an overview of the regional and global situation.

Following the advice of the Emergency Committee, the director-general declared that the COVID-19 pandemic continues to constitute a public health emergency of international concern. He accepted the advice of the committee to WHO and issued the committee's advice to states parties as temporary recommendations under the IHR. The Emergency Committee will be reconvened within three months or earlier, at the discretion of the director-general.

The Statement on the 3rd meeting provides further details on proceedings and advice provided by the Committee (https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/01-05-2020-statement-on-the-third-meeting-of-the-international-health-regulations-(2005)-emergency-committee-regarding-the-outbreak-of-coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)).

Subject in focus: smallpox eradication and key lessons for tackling COVID-19
-------------------------------------------------------------------
"When it comes to epidemic disease, we have a shared responsibility and a shared destiny," WHO director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus

8 May 2020 marks the 40th anniversary of the Declaration of Smallpox Eradication by the World Health Assembly. Smallpox claimed more than 300 million lives in the 1st 3/4 of the 20th century alone and on average around 4 million deaths each year. It had existed for at least 3000 years and was one of the world's most feared diseases until it was eradicated by a global effort, led by WHO. It is now the only human disease to have been eradicated worldwide. How the global community came together at the time to eradicate smallpox offers important and valuable lessons today in the fight against COVID-19.

COVID-19 is not the same as smallpox. Smallpox was caused by the variola virus, an orthopoxvirus, transmissible from one person to another by respiratory droplets or direct contact, and a vaccine had been available for over 150 years. COVID-19 also passes from person to person and via contact with contaminated surfaces, but there are currently no licenced vaccines available. Regardless, measures and approaches employed to eradicate smallpox, which centred around strong political will, basic field epidemiology and life-saving public health interventions, are equally pertinent today as the world battles the COVID-19 pandemic.

The key public health strategies and the effort at the national level that were critical to succeed at the time remain at the core of everything we must do to combat COVID-19. These include but are not limited to: surveillance, case-finding, contact-tracing, isolation and quarantine where appropriate, building a sense of community ownership, and concerted and accelerated global research and development into vaccines, diagnostics, therapeutics and diagnostics to supplement public health and social measures, and life-saving clinical practices.

Just as it was for smallpox, effective communication to enable people to protect themselves and others, and to find new cases, remains central to outbreak response today. Getting the right information to the right people in the right way at the right time remains absolutely critical -- from posters for polio in the 1950s, picture cards for smallpox in the 1970s, large-scale social mobilization for major public health programmes over the last forty years, to clear risk communication and 'managing the infodemic' in 2020 to fight misinformation. Rumours have always abounded, even if the way we address them must change in today's world.

Nonetheless, these time-tested strategies alone could not have saved humanity from the scourge of smallpox were it not for global cooperation and mutual support. This gives us hope that we can achieve the same result in a new era. Despite the geopolitical tensions today, just as there were during the Cold War when smallpox was finally eradicated during the 1970s, scientists and public health workers from around the world are working together to contain a virulent infection that threatens our health.

The 40th anniversary of the eradication of smallpox is also significant for immunization. The eradication of smallpox laid the foundation for immunization programmes worldwide, underpinning the establishment of primary healthcare in many countries. Today, vaccine hesitancy is on the rise and may yet derail the global response to COVID-19 if communication countermeasures are not in place. Vaccines work, and vaccination continues to save up to 3 million lives every year from polio, measles, and other infectious and chronic diseases, beyond the millions of deaths averted thanks to the discovery and adoption of the smallpox vaccine.

On 8 May 2020, WHO launched a commemorative smallpox postal stamp to mark this historic achievement in public health history. The stamp designed for WHO by the United Nations Postal Administration was unveiled to honour our collective legacy, the people who made it possible, and the global solidarity we need today to fight a new common threat (https://unstamps.org/shop/40th-anniv-of-eradication-of-smallpox-chf-170-ge-definitive-full-stamp-sheet/).

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 214. This includes 19 countries (including 4 territories) from the Western Pacific region, 61 countries (including 7 territories) from the European region, 10 countries from the South East Asia region, 22 countries (including 1 territory) from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 54 countries (including 19 territories) from the Americas region, and 48 countries (including 2 territories) from the African region.

In the 24 hours since the last WHO update:
------------------------------------------
The Americas region reported 43 300 new cases (49.4% of the global newly reported cases), and 3126 deaths (57.6%) were recorded for this 24-hour period. Of the newly confirmed cases in the region, 51.1% were reported by the USA, followed by Brazil at 24.3%, and Peru at 8.4%. Recognizing that USA data are overshadowing the regional proportions, if newly confirmed cases from the USA are excluded, then Brazil reported 49.6% of the newly reported cases in the region, followed by Peru at 17.1%, Mexico at 7.6%, and Chile at 7.2%.

The European region reported 28 308 new cases (32.3% of the global newly reported cases) and 1941 deaths (35.8%). Russia reported 37.8% of the newly confirmed cases in the region, the UK 19.5%, Turkey 7.0%, Italy 4.9%, Germany 4.3%, and Spain 4.0%.

The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 8125 new cases (9.3% of the global newly reported cases) and 143 deaths (2.6%). Saudi Arabia reported 22.1% of the regional newly reported cases, followed by Pakistan at 21.7%, Iran at 18.3%, Qatar 11.3%, and the United Arab Emirates at 6.2%.

The African region reported 2247 new cases (2.6% of the global newly reported cases) and 47 deaths (0.87%). South Africa reported 18.9% of the newly reported cases in the region in the past 24 hours, followed by Nigeria at 17.0%, Ghana at 16.6%, Algeria at 8.2%, Mayotte at 5.1%, Gabon at 4.8% at 6.2%, and the DR Congo 4.5%.

The Western Pacific region reported 1263 new cases (1.4% of the global newly reported cases) and 33 deaths (0.61%). Singapore reported 58.7% of the newly reported cases, followed by the Philippines at 26.8%, and Japan at 6.7%. Removing Singapore from the denominator has the Philippines at 64.9%, Japan at 16.1%, Malaysia at 7.5%, and Australia at 4.0%.

The South East Asia region reported 4486 new cases (5.1% of the global newly reported cases) and 139 deaths (2.6%). India reported 75.6% of newly reported cases, followed by Bangladesh at 15.7% and Indonesia at 7.5%. Removing India from the denominator, Bangladesh represents 64.4% of the newly reported cases, Indonesia represents 30.8%, the Maldives at 2.7%, and Myanmar at 1.3%.

Figure 2. Epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases, by date of report and WHO region, 30 Dec 2019 through 8 May 2020, at the source URL above, is an excellent representation of the epidemic starting in the Western Pacific, transitioning to multiregional activity as the virus travelled. One sees the contribution of the ongoing epidemics in Europe and the increasing cases in the Americas region, fueled by the USA, but other countries are following suit. The curve tends to drop over the weekends and rebounds following the weekend. Europe has not been rebounding as high at the end of the weekend, demonstrating decreasing newly confirmed cases. South East Asia has been gradually increasing as the cases continue increasing in India.

A somewhat repetitive but necessary reminder: It is clear that the number of reported confirmed cases differs from different reporting websites and is somewhat a function of time of day the website is updated. For example, I note the time we've accessed the Johns Hopkin's CSSE or Worldometer website, but by the time the post is actually finished with the editing process, those numbers have, at times, significantly changed. Case counting is clearly a moving target, and depending upon when the website updates, the numbers may be different. I try to start each post with the latest figures for the calendar day (the John Hopkins CSSE or Worldometer table) and close with the figures from the start of the calendar day (the WHO tables), defining the calendar day as DST (now GMT-4). - Mod.MPP]
