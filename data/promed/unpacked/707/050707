Over the past couple of years, the number of black bears with mange has continued to rise in Virginia. The 1st cases of mange in black bears in Virginia were found in the 1980s. Sarcoptic mange is a parasitic disease that allows sarcoptic mites to bury underneath the skin, causing an extreme inflammatory immune response to the animal. Infected bears physically cannot eat enough to consume sufficient calories to help sustain themselves while also fighting off the disease.

Peach Van Wick is a veterinary research fellow at The Wildlife Center of Virginia. "It's not necessarily the mite itself that ends up causing extreme disease and even death in these animals," she said. "It's all the things that come along with it."

Mange is not new to Virginian black bears, but the number of cases has been on the rise the past few years. In 2015, there were 2 confirmed cases in the state, both of them in Frederick County. "This past year [2018], we have had confirmed reports in 6 more counties and the number of confirmed reports is already up to 17 for the year," said Jamie Sajecki, black bear project leader for the Virginia Game and Inland Fishery.

Researchers do not know how bears are getting the disease. However, there is a much larger outbreak in Pennsylvania that has been spreading into Virginia. Northern Virginia is seeing the largest outbreak, including Shenandoah, Frederick and Warren counties.

Researchers also do not know why the increase is happening now or why some bears are more susceptible. "Mange has been around in different species for hundreds of years, so why is it now affecting bears," asked Van Wick. "Is it something about the bear that's changing, something about the mite that's changing? That's not really known right now."

When it comes to the Shenandoah National Park, officials typically do not intervene in cases of mange in the black bear population. The park had just one suspected case of mange this summer in a bear that was frequently seen between mile markers 52 and 54. "Sarcoptic mange in black bears is caused by a native parasite. National Park Service policy states that we are to let natural processes prevail," said Rolf Gubler, a wildlife biologist for Shenandoah National Park.

The Wildlife Center and the Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries take a different approach by catching some of the bears and administering treatment. Recently, the Wildlife Center has been using a different form of treatment than in past years, a treatment that was originally developed for flea and tick prevention in dogs and cats. "It's shown to be efficient against the sarcoptic mite as well, and we actually have a couple of successful cases now that we've treated with that one-time oral medication and released those animals," said Van Wick.

For the public, if you see a bear with suspected mange in the wild while hunting or hiking, the best course of action to take is to contact the Wildlife Center or Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries.

[Infection by mites that cause mange, such as _Sarcoptes scabiei_, is common among carnivores worldwide. In some cases, the infection becomes uncontrollable and results in severe mange. It is likely that the occurrence of mange at high frequencies indicates an underlying increased susceptibility to this parasite, and perhaps also to other parasites. The observation that burdens of other ectoparasites are also high in mangy bears indicates that bear immune defenses might be compromised. It is important to determine what is causing this to anticipate, prevent and mitigate the impact it might be having on black bear populations.
