Jakarta, Indonesia reported a Zika virus (ZIKV) infection for the 1st time in Indonesia. The good news is that [Zika is caused by] a virus transmitted by mosquitoes but which is not as severe as dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF).

"Zika virus belongs to a family of viruses that cause dengue and chikungunya, the flaviviruses," said Prof Amin Subandrio, head of Biomolecular [Virology at the] Eijkman Institute, who reported this finding when contacted by Detik Health on Monday (16 Nov 2015). [Although dengue and chikungunya viruses can cause similar disease, chikungunya virus belongs to the _Alphavirus_ genus of the Togaviridae family].

According to Prof. Amin, this is the 1st time [that Zika virus as been detected] in Indonesia; Zika virus infection was confirmed by molecular and virological techniques. Previously, new Zika virus infections were detected by serological (antibody) findings [in general, or in Indonesia? - Mod.TY].

These findings will be reported also at the meetings of the JITMM (Joint International Tropical Medicine) to be held at Mahidol University, Thailand, 2-4 Dec 2015.

Epidemiologically, this finding confirms the need for surveillance against Zika viral infections. "That is, this confirms that Zika virus infection does exist in Indonesia," explained Prof. Amin.

Prof Amin said the findings do not need to make people anxious. Although related to the dengue viruses, a Zika virus infection is not as severe as dengue virus infections are. "Like most just ordinary fevers, it will disappear by itself," Prof. Amin said.
