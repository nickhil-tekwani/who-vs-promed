Approximately 191 feral horses have been found dead in a stock pond on Navajo land in northern Arizona, according to Navajo leaders, who attributed the death to ongoing drought and famine.

"These animals were searching for water to stay alive. In the process, they unfortunately burrowed themselves into the mud and couldn't escape because they were so weak," Navajo Nation Vice President Jonathan Nez said in a statement on [Thu 3 May 2018].

Some of the horses were found thigh- to neck-deep in the mud at the stock pond in Gray Mountain, according to Nina Chester, a staff assistant for the office of the president and vice president.

Hydrated lime will be spread over the animals to speed up decomposition. They will be buried on-site, the statement said.

The Navajo community in Arizona has had to contend with a growing feral horse population of about 50 000 to 70 000, according to the statement.

"This tragic incident exemplifies the problem the Navajo Nation faces in an overpopulation of feral horses," said Navajo Nation President Russell Begaye.

Horses dying at the Gray Mountain stock pond isn't new, Navajo officials said. It's a seasonal issue.

An intense drought hit the southwestern United States this year [2018], creating dry conditions in northern New Mexico and southwestern Arizona, according to CNN affiliate KNXV-TV. A drought emergency was declared for the Navajo Nation in March.

Drought and dryness as of [Thu May 2018] were affecting more than 6 million people in Arizona, which is almost the entire population of the state, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Integrated Drought Information System program. About 50 percent of the state is under extreme drought conditions.

[Drought is a serious condition for both people and animals. Drought is no respecter of people, wild horses, or any other domestic or wild animal. This is a tragic situation.

The tragic situation of 1930-1936, better known as the "Dust Bowl", resulted in the deaths of thousands of animals and many, many people. Hopefully history will not repeat itself in Arizona.

Unfortunately, unless the other wild horses and wild animals have water sources, it is possible they will die from lack of water.

Putting lye over the horses will help speed their decomposition and will possibly decrease the odor of decomposition. - Mod.TG

Sadly drought isn't the only issue at play here. As discussed here (https://www.hcn.org/issues/49.20/tribal-affairs-what-will-navajo-nation-do-about-its-wild-horse-problem and https://indiancountrymedianetwork.com/news/native-news/controlling-navajo-nations-free-roaming-horse-dilemma/) feral horse management has been an on-going issue for the Navajo Nation and other western tribes as well as herds managed by the Bureau of Land Management. The closure of the few remaining equine slaughter plants in 2007 in the United States has also played a role in burgeoning feral horse populations. The remaining alternatives to bring feral horse populations into line with the carrying capacity of the land remain expensive and/or controversial as noted in the above links. - Mod.JH
