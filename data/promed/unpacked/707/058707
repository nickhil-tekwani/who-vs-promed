H5N1 virus found in NZ ducks
----------------------------
Low levels of the H5N1 virus have been found in 2 samples taken from
Mallard ducks in New Zealand. It came from a surveillance programme
researching the presence of avian influenza.

Known as LPAI [low pathogenic avian influenza] H5N1, the Ministry of
Agriculture and Forestry says it is different to "bird flu," which is
the highly pathogenic form of the virus.

Spokesman Dr Andre van Haldren says the samples were taken from
healthy birds and there have been no reported bird deaths or disease.
He says this confirms that strains of non disease causing avian
influenza viruses are present in our wild bird populations.

[Even though this was a research project it demonstrates that when
one looks for disease, however unexpected, it may be present. As the
postings below indicate there is virus circulating in the wild bird
population. Wild birds variously influence the captive birds by a
variety of interactions.

This is a low pathogenicity strain but officials will certainly be
watching for sick birds or evidence of mutation to a more virulent
strain. - Mod.TG
