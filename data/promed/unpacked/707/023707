Observations of a Local Saudi Arabian Ophthalmologist
-----------------------------------------------------
JIZAN: A number of local and international newspapers have carried
statements by government officials concerning the spread of Rift Valley
Fever in the Jizan region. According to a statement issued on 23 Sep 2000
by the information division of the Ministry of Health, 95 people in Jizan
had been affected by the disease with 25 deaths. Reports of the disease
came from all towns in the region. The statement also said that insecticide
was being sprayed both from aircraft and from land vehicles. Pools of
stagnant water were filled in. Sick animals were killed and dead animals
were burned.
Such reports give the impression that the rate of mortality is as high as
25 percent and that every inch of the province is struggling against the
virus, while officials are simultaneously employing every possible means to
eradicate the virus and the mosquitoes which may carry it. As an
ophthalmologist, I have observed that the disease can cause partial or
total blindness. I have examined several such cases and have toured the
Al-Aridha area, one of the worst-affected areas. Several hundred people are
affected though no precise statistics are available presently. However, 95
percent of these cases heal themselves without treatment within a few days.
The ministry's statistics refer, of course, to the cases admitted to
hospitals. I have also observed that death occurs in less than 2 percent of
cases. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in the US has been observing
the disease for the past several years and says that 99 percent of cases
will be healed between 2 to 7 days. Symptoms resembling influenza appear
but only one percent of affected humans die.
I have also seen that the majority of cases have been among the
cattle-breeding population in villages around Al-Aridhah. The cattle fell
sick with the fever which caused abortion and death. People who were in
constant contact with the animals also became sick. The difficulty of
disposing hygienically of dead animals, plus the increasing number of
mosquitoes because of seasonal rains, increased the problem of controlling
the disease. The practice in rural areas of sleeping in the open is another
reason for the spread of the disease. It is worthy of note that people in
towns such as Jizan and Sabya are seldom affected by the disease because
they live in air-conditioned houses and so are not often exposed to
mosquitoes. Townspeople also have little contact with cattle. Those cases
reported from hospitals in Jizan, Sabya and Abu Arish are either people
from across the border in Yemen or from the affected villages of Al-Aridha.
The disease occurs only when people have direct contact with sick animals
or where people are exposed to constant mosquito bites.
I feel that official efforts to control the disease have not been
proportionate to the seriousness of the disease. There are notable failures
in the disinfecting process, the filling in of stagnant water holes and the
disposing of animal carcasses. People in Al-Aridha say that the stench of
decaying animal bodies is everywhere because no efforts are made to dispose
of carcasses in a hygienic manner.

Ophthalmology and Surgery in Jizan.
