NIPAH VIRUS, AUSTRALIAN TV REPORT

ABC TV (Australian Broadcasting Corporation) presented a half-hour report
on Nipah virus followed by an interview with Stephen Morse. The report,
filmed in Malaysia, included much footage from infected properties
including the first infected property. The program also claimed, I think on
the basis of retrospective serology, that the first human cases were
actually in November 1997. This is a synopsis of the program extracted
from their website, i.e., their words not mine.

"A lot of people could have been saved if we had not ignored some rather
uncomfortable facts", [said] Dr Henry Too Hing Lee, Animal Diseases
Specialist, Malaysia.
"We see this as another instance of a worldwide trend where diseases
previously unknown to medical and veterinary science are suddenly
emerging", [said] Dr Peter Daniels, Veterinary Epidemiologist, CSIRO.
One in three families lost a loved one when a strange disease swept through
the Malaysian village of Bukit Pelandok and claimed 80 lives. But the
deadly Nipah virus should never have made it to this prosperous pig farming
community.
This week Foreign Correspondent presents dramatic new evidence that the
aggressive, species hopping virus surfaced long before authorities acted
and far from Bukit Pelandok, now a quarantined ghost town.
Invasive farming practices set Malaysia on a collision course with the
killer disease as political inaction and ineptitude saw the virus spread.
The advice given out by the Malaysian Government "Â… was definitely fatal
for a lot of pig farmers", [said] Dr Henry Too Hing Lee, an animal diseases
specialist at University Putra, Malaysia.
Tim Lester's extensive investigation of the world's latest virulent
disaster features extensive material recorded by Malaysia's Veterinary
Department of the belated campaign to stem the outbreak. There are also
sombre warnings from experts on the ground, including CSIRO Veterinary
Epidemiologist Dr Peter Daniels that deadly viruses, previously unknown to
science, are on the march around the world where new aggressive farming
practices are forging into ancient and untouched landscapes.
Tapes are available. Further information is on their website at
