The following background data on plague in Uganda are abstracted from Gideon (http://www.GideonOnline.com) and the Gideon e-book series (1, 2) (primary references available on request):

The earliest record of plague in Africa was a report by missionaries in Uganda in 1877, and reporting statistics for much of the continent have been documented for more than 100 years. A series of plague epidemics were recorded in East Africa during the 1920s and 1930s (see graph 3; http://www.gideononline.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/Uganda-Plague.png).

31 305 plague deaths were reported in Uganda during 1910 to 1919; 17 410 during 1920 to 1929; 11 387 during 1930 to 1939.

Presumed local reservoirs include the Nile rat, _Arvicanthus niloticus_. Presumed local flea vectors include _Xenopsylla cheopis_ and _X. brasiliensis_.

Notable outbreaks:
1982 - an outbreak (152 cases, 3 fatal) was reported.
