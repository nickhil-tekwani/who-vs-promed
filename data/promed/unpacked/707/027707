Virus vaccine campaign unlikely to be repeated
----------------------------------------------
Scotland appears unlikely to repeat its compulsory vaccination
campaign against the deadly midge-born bluetongue virus. Chief vet
Simon Hall dropped the clearest hint yet at a dairy cattle health and
welfare conference in Dumfries yesterday [3 Dec 2009] that compulsory
injections will be dropped.

His comments came as dairy farmers at the meeting became the latest to
show considerable support for national campaigns to eradicate both
bovine viral diarrhoea (BVD) and Johne's disease from the national herd.

Mr Hall said the livestock sector was in a "very different place" from
where it was a year ago when bluetongue was advancing across
continental Europe at a seemingly unstoppable pace. A concerted
vaccination effort on the continent had worked and there was no
evidence of the disease re-emerging in England.

"It looks pretty unlikely that compulsory vaccination will be required
next year. That leaves you to make your own choice," he said. But the
chief vet said the advice from government would still be to vaccinate
to keep up immunity.

NFU [National Farmers Union] Scotland vice-president Nigel Miller
similarly urged farmers to continue vaccinating against the virus that
either kills animals or causes health and welfare problems. He too
said industry needed to keep up its guard on animal imports from
bluetongue zones on the continent, adding that if farmers had to buy
in livestock it should be done now rather than waiting for summer when
the potential of taking in infected cattle and sheep was highest.

He added: "If we take in disease next year we will have thrown
everything away that we have worked for."

The conference on dairy cattle health and welfare was held in the wake
of the European Food Safety Authority and the UK's Farm Animal Welfare
Council both criticising farmers over poor standards.

NFU president Jim McLaren said the UK's industry record on welfare and
health issues was superior, but the conference was told the sector
still needed to do more to deliver improvements on mastitis, lameness,
poor fertility, tackling disease and in securing longer lives for
dairy cows.

[As rightly stated by the Chief Veterinary Officer for Scotland, the
concerted bluetongue vaccination effort on continental Europe had
worked, diminishing the risk of the virus reappearing on the British
Isles. The impact of vaccination was particularly impressive in
France, where the compulsory and subsidised vaccination of cattle and
sheep, by veterinarians, has led to a steep reduction in the number of
BTV outbreaks.

As of 30 Nov 2009, a total of 81 outbreaks (= affected holdings) were
recorded during 2009 [in France], of which 72 were caused by BTV-8, 6
by BTV-1, and 3 by both BTV-1 and BTV-8. In 23 of the holdings, the
reports were based on clinical suspicions while on 58 holdings the
cases were non-clinical, including 26 related to sentinel surveillance
and 32 to various factors (such as sampling before transportation).

The species involved in these outbreaks were: 72 cattle-holdings, 6
sheep holdings, 2 camelid and 1 goat holdings. The French vaccination
covers both BTV-1 and BTV-8; the minimum vaccination age for cattle is
2.5 months, and for sheep 3 months.

The renewed vaccination campaign for 2009-2010 has been launched on 2
Nov 2009 for a period of 12 months. Further details can be seen in
France's presentation for EU's Standing Committee on the Food Chain
and Animal Health (SCFCAH) meeting of 30 Nov-01 Dec 2009 (see at
<http://ec.europa.eu/food/committees/regulatory/scfcah/animal_health/presentations/091201/bt_france.pdf>). -
