Warning stands on danger of raw oysters
---------------------------------------
State officials are renewing warnings about the risks of eating raw oysters
for people with problematic immune systems after at least 2 recent deaths
were caused by a bacterial infection from the shellfish. At least 10
Floridians have died in 2004 from infection by the bacterium _Vibrio
vulnificus_, which is often harbored in oysters. At least 3 of them died
from eating raw oysters, health officials said.
People with compromised immune systems should avoid raw oysters, said state
health secretary John Agwunobi: "The old wives' tale that raw oysters are
safe in months that have an R simply isn't true. For those who are in
high-risk groups, there is no safe time to consume raw oysters."
Those most at risk for developing serious illness from _Vibrio vulnificus_
include heavy drinkers with liver damage and people with health conditions
such as liver disease, diabetes, cancer, stomach disorders or any illness
or treatment that weakens the immune system. For people with normal immune
systems the risk is much lower, officials said. The risk is greatly reduced
by thoroughly cooking oysters.
The renewed warnings come after news reports of a couple recent cases. A 39
year old man of Wewahitchka in the Florida Panhandle died 5 Nov 2004.
Another man from Panama City recently had to have his leg amputated because
of the bacterium. State Health Department spokeswoman Lindsay Hodges said
the agency couldn't confirm details of any case because of confidentiality,
but said there have been 3 fatal cases in Nov 2004, which is sometimes
considered a safe month because ocean water is generally colder. The latest
fatal case was added to the list Tue, 16 Nov 2004, and was in Hillsborough
County, Hodges said. She couldn't release the victim's name or sex or say
when the person died.
Not all deaths involve exposure from eating raw oysters. The disease can
also be contracted if a person has an open wound and wades in sea water
where the bacteria is present.
