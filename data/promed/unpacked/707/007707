Chikungunya [infection], the viral disease that is sweeping the deep south,
has now surfaced in Phuket, according to the Phuket Provincial Health
Office. A press release issued by Kusuma Sawangpan of the Disease Control
and Prevention Division confirmed 4 cases of the disease on the island,
with all the patients being treated at Vachira Phuket Hospital.

The vector for the disease is the _Aedes_ spp. mosquito, which also spreads
misery in the form of yellow and dengue fevers [But yellow fever virus is
not present in Asia. - Mod.TY]

Chikungunya [virus infection] symptoms, similar to those of dengue fever,
include an initial period of very high fever, typically lasting a few days,
with a longer period of joint and muscle pain, headaches, and insomnia.

Unlike dengue, which can lead to death in very young children, chikungunya
affects all age groups equally. It is less deadly than dengue, with far
fewer cases of people going into shock and dying. Following exposure, the
incubation period for the virus in the bloodstream is typically 2 to 4
days, up to a maximum of 12.

There are, as yet, no antiviral drug treatments for chikungunya [virus
infection], nor is there a vaccine against it. Treatment is supportive,
including bed rest and painkillers, especially paracetamol. However, other
common painkillers including aspirin, ibuprofen, and non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are not recommended.

Prevention is the same as for other mosquitoborne diseases: prevention of
mosquito bites by wearing long-sleeved clothes, using mosquito repellent,
fitting windows with mosquito screens, and emptying out containers of water
in which the mosquito larvae can grow to adulthood.

A chikungunya epidemic has already struck Thailand's 4 southernmost
provinces, logging 20 000 sufferers but no fatalities. Dr Sanphong
Rittiraksa, a preventive medicine expert at the Songkhla Provincial Health
Office, said on [5 May 2009] that Narathiwat was the hardest hit province,
with 7000 patients, followed by Songkhla with 6500. Most of the victims
reportedly were rubber tappers.

The disease emerged in Narathiwat last November [2008] and spread to Yala,
Pattani, and finally Songkhla, despite efforts by health officials in every
province to contain the epidemic, Dr Sanphong said. Now the disease is
widely epidemic in the southern districts of Songkhla, including Sabai Yoi,
Thepha, Nathawee, Chana, and Sadao.

Rubber tappers are advised to soak their work clothes in a mosquito
repellent chemical solution to protect them from being bitten by
mosquitoes, Dr Sanphong advised.

[Previously, Phuket's neighboring province, Krabi, had reported 2 cases of
chikungunya infection who were likely to have contracted the disease in
their hometown, Pattani province (see prior PRO/MBDS posting Chikungunya -
Thailand: Krabi 20090330.1219).

According to the Weekly Epidemiological Surveillance Report (WESR) of the
