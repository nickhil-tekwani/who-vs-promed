A 2-member team from National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) has arrived in Bathinda to take stock of the outbreak of jaundice cases in 2 villages that have till now reported 165 patients and one death. The team comprising Dr Hemlata and Dr Hema Gogia will visit Harraipur village, where hepatitis A has been reported, and Rama Mandi, where hepatitis E infection has been reported.

Harraipur started reporting the cases from 5 Sep 2019, while in Rama Mandi, [illness] started from 14 Sep 2019, said civil surgeon, Bathinda, Dr Amrik Singh Sandhu. "Till now, 120 cases have been reported from Harraipur and 45 from Rama Mandi. The disease is under control. We sent 9 samples for testing 2 days back, and only one returned positive. These patients are under treatment at government as well as at private clinics."

Regarding the person who died, Sandhu said, "He had severe infection." The death occurred on 12 Sep 2019 at a private hospital in Ludhiana. However, health authorities have not confirmed if it was a clear case of jaundice death, as the patient had many other problems as well.

Commenting on the reasons behind the outbreak, Sandhu said, "It is a clear case of water contamination in both the villages. As per the tests done on patients, we have detected viral hepatitis A in Harraipur and hepatitis E in Rama Mandi. Following heavy rainfall in the past, it seems leakage occurred in water and sewer pipes, resulting in supply of contaminated water. Water samples were taken from the area, and more than 50% failed tests."

Rakesh Sharma, executive engineer, water supply and sanitation department, said, "The pond at Harraipur that gets sewer water overflowed."

[The types of viral hepatitis that are food or waterborne are types A and E. Type A is the classical cause of so-called infectious hepatitis and in the developing world tends to be a disease of childhood and often asymptomatic. In much of the world, close to 100% of the population is already seropositive. On the other hand, hepatitis E tends to be a disease of adults and is particularly severe in pregnant women. The E virus has a number of genotypes, some of which are zoonotic. - Mod.LL
