[Chuy (Chui, Tschui) Region, the northernmost region (oblast) of the Kyrgyz Republic, is the leading dairy cattle region of the country. Chuy is bounded on the north by Kazakhstan, and clockwise, Issyk Kul Region, Naryn Region, Jalal-Abad Region, and Talas Region.

Kyrgyzstan's last FMD report to the OIE was submitted on 26 Aug 2014 (20140827.2726515). A follow-up/final report was submitted on 1 Oct 2014, according to which no additional outbreaks were recorded while the causative agent remained untyped. "Vaccination in response to the outbreak" was applied, addressing 1553 head of cattle in Talas, vaccinated with a "polyvalent vaccine against A, O and Asia 1 serotypes," (which are in fact A Iran-2005, O PanAsia2, and Asia1-Sindh 08).

According to the Republic's most recent available periodic report to the OIE, a semi-annual report covering January-June 2019, FMD was not recorded since 15 Sep 2014. Annual mass vaccinations of cattle are continuously applied; during the said period (January - June 2019) this involved 1 667 200 cattle doses and 4300 pigs. According to earlier annual reports, FMD vaccinations cover cattle exclusively, vaccinated at least twice yearly; the cattle population of Kyrgyzstan is nearly 1.6 million head. The number of cattle doses used each year reportedly exceeded 3.3 million.

The sheep (5.2 million) and goat (0.8 million) populations are not included in the official vaccination scheme, subsidized by the state.

Kyrgyzstan is one of the 14 countries included in FAO's "West Eurasia FMD Roadmap" inaugurated in 2008 during a meeting in Shiraz, Iran. All countries pledged on this vision "regional cooperation among Eurasian countries for the progressive control of FMD through public and private partnerships leading towards freedom of clinical disease by 2020 [this has been later revised to 2025] for economic development and poverty alleviation." The participants adopted a stepwise approach, including 5 stages of advancement towards the goal. The implementation of the roadmap vision required coordinating the set of national efforts under an overall framework of progressive risk management to reduce the impact of FMD in the region: sharing of information, technical knowledge, possible donor support, cooperation between countries within the region and beneficiaries of the action.

The report of the most recent (8th) meeting of the West Eurasia FMD Roadmap, held in Shiraz, Iran, 4-6 Mar 2019, is available at http://www.fao.org/3/ca8378en/ca8378en.pdf. It includes (page 17) a presentation of the provisional roadmap for 2008-2025 based on self-assessment questionnaires (14 countries, validated and provisional/non-validated stages).

The detailed FMD Progressive Control Pathway (PCP) Stages Evaluation of Kyrgyzstan is to be found on page 66; the following recommendations were included:

1. Acceptance of PCP stage 2 (upon confirmation by FMD WG);
2. Possibility to progress to PCP stage 3 for a zone (according to the control programme presented to the FMD WG).

According to the mentioned West Eurasia FMD Roadmap report, the country seeks an FMD free status without vaccination, starting with PCP stage 3 in the northeast and, by 2022, PCP stage 4 in the whole country. Such goals will require efforts to further suppress and control the spread of the virus and to enhance surveillance, including sampling, serotyping, and genotyping. - Mod.AS
