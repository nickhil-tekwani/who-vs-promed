Officials claim case of mad cow disease found in Ukraine
--------------------------------------------------------
KIEV: A Ukrainian village was put under quarantine and 6 people admitted to
hospital after what an official claimed Fri [14 Jun] was a case of
so-called mad cow disease.
The quarantine was imposed on the village of Petrokorbovka in central
Ukraine, about 300 km (185 miles) from the capital Kiev after a diseased
cow from a private farm was discovered on Wed [12 Jun], said Tetiana
Pomazanova of the Emergency Situations Ministry. The carcass of the
infected animal was destroyed. Pomazanova claimed that the strain of the
supposed mad cow disease was different from that found elsewhere in Europe,
but didn't elaborate.
Ukraine suffered a mad cow scare 2 years ago, but tests later showed that
the suspect cows had died of rabies. Pomazanova also claimed on Friday that
6 of 17 residents in the area received inoculations at a local hospital and
were released. But there is no existing vaccine against the fatal
brain-eating disease for either its bovine form or the human ailment it is
believed to be linked to.
Health officials in the regional capital of Kirovohrad could not be reached
to confirm what inoculations residents had received. Veterinary
investigations are ongoing, and Pomazanova said she did not know when the
quarantine would be lifted.
[The information in this news release is unsatisfactory and might even be
misleading, but in light of the importance of the BSE issue we call upon
colleagues in Ukraine for clarification. Repeated attempts of ProMED-mail
to obtain explanations from the Ukrainian State Department of Veterinary
Medicine in the Ministry of Agrarian Policy have not been fruitful. - Mod.AS]

Mad cow disease could hit Russia, experts warn
----------------------------------------------
The arrival of mad cow disease in Poland has led to warnings from Russian
producers that shoddy controls at customs and in local meat production are
putting Russian livestock at risk as well.
The Russian Agriculture Ministry banned bone-in meat and livestock imports
from Poland in early May. While the ministry suggested checking Polish
veterinary controls on meat producers, it was not a condition for
continuing trade, said Aleksander Milota, consul for commercial issues at
the Polish Embassy.
Russias restrictions on Polish meat are less harsh than those used
recently on American poultry, when Russian veterinarians spent a month
checking American factories for additives and salmonella. Even so, Milota
believes Russian authorities overreacted in responding to bovine spongiform
encephalopathy (BSE) in Poland: "All our cattle are tested before being
exported," he said. "There is a psychological factor, which is the fear of
the disease, that makes the government make unnecessary decisions such as
banning cattle imports." Russia used to import 8000 tons of Polish beef per
year.
Poland, expecting to join the European Union (EU) in 2004, follows European
safety requirements, which demand parental records for all animals to allow
genealogical tracing. Cows 30 months old must undergo veterinary testing
for BSE, and feeding meat and bone meal (MBM) to cattle, a practice
believed to spread the disease, is also forbidden.
The Polish BSE case has not affected meat prices in Russia, according to
the Institute for Studies of the Agrarian Market (IKAR). IKAR analyst
Larisa Torogova said she believes that neither meat dealers nor consumers
have become concerned about BSE, since Russia has several supplying
countries for the 2 million tons of red meat imported each year.
Torogova said Germany and Ukraine are the largest beef exporters to Russia.
No BSE has yet been detected in Ukraine, and Germanys controls are now
stricter than those in the rest of Europe after struggling with 125 cases
of BSE in 2001. Its last BSE case was detected in May, though it has had no
reports of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, the human disease which is
believed to be transmitted by eating contaminated beef.
A State Customs Committee document shows imports of boneless beef are
allowed from Austria, Belgium, Germany, Denmark, Ireland, Spain, Italy,
Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Slovakia, Slovenia, Finland,
France, the Czech Republic and Japan, as well as Poland. Beef from England,
Greece, Portugal, Switzerland, and South Korea is entirely prohibited.
Yury Kostenko, chief of the microbiology department at the VM Gorbatov Meat
Research Institute of All Russia, said those restrictions are enough to
decrease contamination risks. "Few remember it, but Russia was the first
European country to ban British beef and cow imports in 1986," he said.
[Memory is tricky. BSE in the UK was first externally reported in the paper
"A novel progressive spongiform encephalopathy in cattle" by Wells and
colleagues in the Veterinary Record of 31 Oct 1987. The Phillips Report,
Vol 10, chapter 6.12 says that the first non-EU country (not the USSR)
banned imports of live cattle from the UK in Jun 1988. Chapter 6.24
mentions that by Feb 1991, 16 non-EU countries -- including the USSR -- had
imposed a ban on UK beef exports. - Mod.AS]. But official barriers are not
effective in practice, according to some meat-business insiders. Alexander
Spiridonov, president of the St Petersburg-based Northwestern Association
of Meat Producers, said: "The strict European control on meat production,
which is in accordance with Russian veterinary requirements, should be
enough to avoid another veterinary inspection at the ports. At the end,
officials dont check the cargo." He added that trade barriers against BSE
are a government attempt to soften relations with local farmers, many of
whom are close to bankruptcy.
Russia has had no reported cases of BSE. But cattle producers complain
there are not enough veterinary inspections of their operations. Some say
they doubt the enforcement of legislation regulating the use of animal and
bone meal in feed. Its use in cattle feed has been prohibited in Russia
since 1996 and even longer in Europe. But there is little to no supervision
by veterinary inspectors, who are supposed to check feeding procedures and
reasons for animals deaths. MBM is still used for poultry and hogs, which
are not believed to carry BSE.
That there is only one laboratory to analyze Russias 27 million cows adds
to suspicions of internal safety controls. That laboratory, the Russian
Research Institute for the Protection of Animals, has tested the meat of
1200 animals since its beginning in 1999, 15 years after the disease was
first diagnosed in England. The laboratory, in the city of Vladimir, is
supported by Moscow meat-processing factories interested in checking the
quality of their raw product. But the lab does not have equipment to test
live cows or track the diseases path of infection.
"We took cows from the majority of the regions in the country, and not a
single case was discovered," said Alexander Yegorov, deputy chief of the
Department of Rare Diseases. He said those tests should be sufficient to
show that Russian livestock are free of BSE. But the analysis, at 20 USD
per test, is not affordable for many farmers and so has a limited reach.
"It is impossible to exclude this possibility [of BSE] because it might
have reached our territory from cows and MBM exported to Russia," he said.
The EU, which monitors the potential spread of the disease, warned in 2000
that Poland was likely to have a BSE case. The Brussels-based Press Service
of the European Commission has reported that scientists are now evaluating
countries risks of exposure to BSE. They said definitive conclusions about
Russia have not yet been reached, but "certainly the risk of spreading [the
disease to Russia] is not excluded."

Slovakia reports tenth BSE case
-------------------------------
Bratislava: Slovakia's 10th case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE)
was discovered on Tue [02 Jun 2002] evening by the State Veterinary
Institute (SVU) in Zvolen, central Slovakia.
It is the first case for 3 months. The others were reported between Sep
2001 and Mar 2002 following the introduction of intensive monitoring for
the disease. The latest case was a 72 month old cow from a farm near Novy
Zamky.

BSE in the Czech Republic and in Slovakia
-----------------------------------------
Prague: A total of 205 073 head of cattle have been tested for BSE by the
State Veterinary Administration SVS staff since Jan 2001, with only 2
positive cases found, SVS spokesman Josef Duben told CTK today [03 Jul 2002].
Bratislava: Slovak veterinarians detected the 10th case of BSE at a Kolta
farm in southwestern Slovakia, State Veterinary and Food Administration
spokesman Martin Chudy told CTK today, adding the confirmation of the
disease will be available by the end of the week.

Japanese food company seeks protection
--------------------------------------
TOKYO: Nippon Shokuhin Co., a Japanese food processing firm hit by a beef
mislabelling scandal, filed Wed [03 Jul 2002] for court protection from
creditors. The company, based in the south western city of Fukuoka, is the
second Japanese meatpacker to seek protection this year, according to
Teikoku Databank Ltd, a private research firm. The first was Snow Brand
Foods Co.
Liabilities left behind by Nippon Shokuhin totalled 21.85 billion yen (180
million USD), Teikoku Databank official Naohiro Fujimoto said.
Nippon Shokuhin tried to pass off 122 tons of foreign beef - worth about
136 million yen (1.13 million USD) - as domestic under the alleged scam,
the Agriculture Ministry has said.
The meatpacker was allegedly attempting to take advantage of a lucrative
government program that buys local meat potentially contaminated with BSE
in order to get it off the market. The latest case followed a similar
scandal that toppled Snow Brand Foods. Snow Brand Foods mislabelled foreign
beef as domestic and sought bankruptcy protection as retail sales of its
food products fell. The scandal also raised questions about corporate
ethics and product safety in Japan. Domestic beef sales have sharply
dropped since authorities here reported the first case of BSE outside of
Europe in September.
Japan's government has spent millions of dollars purchasing and disposing
of local beef potentially tainted with the bovine brain-wasting illness,
which is linked to the fatal human variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.

New geographic BSE risk assessments (GBRs)
-------------------------------------------
Scientists publish geographical risk assessments for seven countries:
Bulgaria, Croatia, Iceland,Latvia, San Marino, Turkey, and Vanuatu.
GBR is a qualitative indicator of the likelihood of the presence of one or
more cattle being infected with BSE. Where its presence is confirmed GBR
gives an indication of the level of infection. The evaluation focuses on
the risk for animals to incubate the disease. There are four categories:
I -- highly unlikely;
II -- unlikely but not excluded;
III -- likely but not confirmed or confirmed, at a lower level;
IV -- confirmed at a higher level.
The Scientific Steering Committee which advises the European Commission on
BSE related issues, has concluded that it is highly unlikely that cattle
infected with the BSE agent are present in the domestic herds in Iceland
and Vanuatu (GBR level I).
They concluded that it is likely that BSE is present in the cattle herds of
Bulgaria, Croatia, Latvia, San Marino, and Turkey, although this is not yet
confirmed (GBR level III).

For our readers' convenience we are including the following clear,
instructive review by Tim Miles, veterinary scientist, Meat and Livestock
Commission, UK. Though written at the end of 2000, it seems to have
retained its value.
Testing for transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) in cattle and
sheep
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.Diagnostic tests
Any diagnostic tests that are to be used for statutory controls must meet
certain scientific criteria and be rigorously validated. None of the tests
currently being developed has the prospect of providing reassurance that an
animal or carcass is BSE free, only that evidence of infection can or
cannot be detected at the time of sampling.
Even if disease specific tests could be developed quickly, which proved
effective on clinically affected animals it would be essential for these to
be tested on animals that have been infected experimentally (in other words
on a known day) so that the effectiveness of the test at all stages between
initial infection and eventual clinical disease could be assessed. In this
context the pathogenesis of the TSEs is essential to an understanding of
what test is most likely to work and at what stage in the incubation
period. For example with scrapie in sheep and mice early multiplication of
the infectious agent takes place in the lymphoreticular system (lymph
nodes, Peyers patches in the gut wall and spleen). Eventually
approximately half way through the incubation period infectivity reaches
the central nervous system ­- brain and spinal cord.
In cattle with an average incubation period of 5 years one might not expect
to detect infectivity in the central nervous system until approximately 30
months after infection. Under such circumstances there would be little
point in testing the brain tissue of slaughtered cattle at abattoirs at
between 18 and 24 months of age because even if infected there would be no
detectable infectivity there. The test would give a false reassurance with
respect to deciding whether or not the animal had been infected.
Most of the claims for diagnostic tests for BSE that have been made have
been premature. Not because the test may not be capable of detecting
infectivity, or markers for infectivity, but because the claims are being
made on the basis of checks on animals that are at the end of their
incubation period (clinically affected) or on animals that may never have
been infected. It is essential that such tests are validated on animals
that are known to be infected but are only part way through their
incubation period before they can legitimately claim to be of value for
testing of animals while alive on farm or dead at the abattoir.
Another factor in the use of such diagnostic tests is which tissue should
be tested. Most of the immunological tests that can detect abnormal prion
protein (PrP) work best on brain tissue. In some species such as sheep it
may be possible to use lymph nodes, tonsils or spleen. Any suggestion that
a test which works on the brain of a clinically affected animal can be
translated to another tissue in the body requires considerable
verification. Not only may infectivity not be present but the
characteristics of that tissue may interfere with the test.
2. Tests for clinically affected cattle or sheep
The current gold standard is the histopathology test that is performed
postmortem and requires brain material which firstly has to be preserved in
formalin and is then stained and examined under the microscope for the
characteristic appearance of TSE specific changes. If there is any degree
of decomposition before the brain is examined then histopathology is not ideal.
The scrapie associated fibrils (SAF) test is performed postmortem and
detects disease specific structures within brain extracts using electron
microscopy. This uses fresh tissue (not preserved) and can work quite well
even if the brain tissue has started to decompose.
A number of diagnostic tests for TSE are based on the interaction of
specific antibodies with a disease specific abnormal prion protein (
PrPSc). The abnormal form of the protein is more resistant to the effects
of degradative enzymes and can be differentiated from normal cell prion
protein ( PrPC) on this basis:
a. The western blot test (as used by Prionics, but also available in many
research laboratories) is used to detect PrPSc protein purified from
treated brain material obtained postmortem by its molecular weight and
reaction with specific antibodies. Further development of this technique
may increase the sensitivity and allow its application to different tissues
but to date only brain material testing has been fully validated.
b. Immunocytochemistry (ICC) also relies on the detection of PrPSc using
specific antibodies. Postmortem brain material is once again required,
preserved. This test is performed directly on the tissue section and does
not involve any protein purification steps.
c. Immunocytochemistry can also work on other tissues such as the third
eyelid or tonsil of sheep. Work is underway both in Britain and abroad to
determine exactly how useful it would be to take biopsies of these tissues
while the animal is still alive as a means of screening flocks. They are
not perfect because it looks as if the genetic makeup of the sheep will
influence how soon after infection one of these tissues becomes positive
for abnormal PrP.
3. Tests evaluated by the European Commission
Three out of 4 key tests performed well in detecting infection in cattle
showing clinical signs of the disease. These 3 tests are to be used in the
pan European BSE surveillance programme starting in January 2001 in all
member states. The three tests are CEA , Prionic and Enfer Scientific. (The
DELFIA test produced by Wallac failed the initial trial but has since
overcome its technical difficulties and will hopefully be shortly added to
the approved list.)
a. Prionics - Switzerland
This a western blot test on brain tissue collected after death. The tissue
is stained on a gel through which is passed an electric current to look for
abnormal prion protein. The test works quickly with a result available
within 24 hours. The Swiss are using this test to screen fallen stock as
well as a proportion of adult cows slaughtered for human consumption. The
UK Veterinary Laboratories Agency have bought in the technology from
Prionics to carry out western blotting and use this to assist with
diagnosis of BSE and scrapie.
b. Enfer Scientific ­ Ireland
This is an ELISA or enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. The antibody used by
the company was manufactured by a British company called Proteus. The assay
like many ELISAs is very sensitive and allows rapid turnaround within 24
hours and theoretically has much greater throughput than the western blot.
It can be partly automated and the company have been commercially testing
spinal cord from cattle slaughtered for human consumption in Ireland for a
couple of years. The test only works after death.
c. CEA ­ France
This is a sandwich immunoassay and very similar to the ELISA test. It also
tests brain tissue collected after death. Because it appears to be more
sensitive than the other tests it is to be used to see if it can detect
abnormal prion protein in the wall of the small intestine of experimentally
infected calves. It will also be used to see if it can detect abnormal
protein in the brain and spinal cord of experimentally infected animals at
an earlier stage than the other tests. If it works then it does have the
potential for testing much younger animals.
4. Murine bioassay
The mouse bioassay involves the intracerebral inoculation of strains of
inbred mice with infected tissues. When the mice either succumb to disease
or die a systematic histopathological examination of the brain is carried
out to look for the characteristic pathological changes associated with the
different TSEs.
The mouse (murine) bioassay has been criticised as being both insensitive
and an inadequate model for determining risk to humans from exposure to
infectivity. Such criticism may be correct in identifying that the presence
of a species barrier between cattle and mice inevitably introduces a loss
of sensitivity but there is also a species barrier between cattle and humans.
The criticism is, however, misplaced in suggesting that any bioassay is
required to do any more than give a comparative assessment of infectivity
in different tissues as opposed to the absolute result that is often
implied. Even assays in cattle will have limits to the quantities of
infectivity detectable.
Whatever the assay model, however, it is possible to infer from the results
that infectivity is present and possibly how much is present relative to
central nervous tissue. In the absence of deaths in the experimental animal
all one can say is that infectivity levels must be lower than the limits of
detection and substantially lower than other tissues such as brain.
The murine bioassay is the only currently available sensitive method of
detecting infectivity in a range of tissues which can deliver results in a
reasonable timescale. Its effectiveness is clearly demonstrated by the
success of the assay in detecting BSE infectivity by both intra-cerebral
and by oral routes of exposure. These mice have been used for many years
for the study of scrapie.
BSE transmits more readily from cattle to mice than does scrapie from sheep
and short of using cattle for all assays the mouse model is the best
available system at present. Transgenic mice may eventually prove better.
5. Transgenic mice
In recent years much progress has been made in the production of strains of
mice that carry PrP genes of other species, sometimes instead of their own
gene, sometimes in addition to their own.
Such techniques have been shown to permit infection of mice with certain
strains of TSE when previously they may have been resistant. This work has
been led by American and Swiss groups but expertise is expanding in several
laboratories in Europe.
Techniques such as deletion and substitution of genes and the production of
chimaeric (mixed) genes are helping to obtain a greater understanding of
the role of the PrP gene in infection. As a simple assay model it seems
possible to reduce incubation periods following inoculation by increasing
the number of copies of PrP genes that are carried by the mouse. The
difficulty with such multiple copy models is that they are difficult to
reproduce consistently and the gene is usually not in its natural position
in the chromosome. Alternative transgenic models which may behave more
naturally involve the removal of the mouse gene and its replacement by the
PrP gene of another species.
While mice carrying human or hamster genes have dominated this field so
far, successful projects both in Britain and abroad to produce mice that
carry PrP genes of cattle or sheep have led to both lower incubation
periods in mice and increased sensitivity of the tests.
Again it must be remembered that mouse bioassay tests are postmortem checks
and incubation times following oral infection are dose related ranging from
120 to 300 days before onset of disease.
6. Tests for TSEs in live animals
The only means of diagnosis in the live animal at present is by clinical
signs and even when cases are examined by experienced veterinarians about
20 per cent of animals diagnosed positive turn out to be negative after
postmortem examination -- i.e., are false positives.
One of the newer tests appears to show real promise for use in live sheep.
This is known as the ICE or capillary immuno-electrophoresis test. It was
developed by Dr Mary-Jo Schmerr of the US Department of Agriculture. It is
unusual in that it requires extremely small samples of blood to be able to
detect scrapie infected sheep. It also appears to work on chronic wasting
disease in elk. Although Dr Schmerr has detected animals that she considers
infected these still have to progress to developing disease so that she can
prove that the test was correct.
Dr Schmerr is collaborating with the UK Veterinary Laboratories Agency to
transfer the technology, initially to use as a test for scrapie in sheep.
Once that is in place and been evaluated an attempt will be made to develop
a similar test for BSE in cattle. There is no guarantee that this will work
because the distribution of the BSE agent in cattle appears to be so
different from that of scrapie in sheep.
7. Urine tests
Alternative diagnostic tests in the live animal involve the detection of
disease specific physiological or metabolic markers. These are secondary
substances produced as a result of infection. Such markers, apparently
related, have been identified in serum and in urine. Whether or not they
remain specific to BSE or scrapie remains to be proven.
Changes have been detected in the constituents of urine of CJD patients,
sheep with scrapie, and cattle with BSE. Molecules that may be disease
specific have been found in cattle and further work is in progress to
develop and validate a diagnostic test. The time of appearance of this
substance at detectable levels in the disease is unknown. Work is underway
to determine when these changes are first detectable in the long incubation
period of BSE.
8. Protein tests
Certain proteins which are present in normal animals are released in larger
quantities into the cerebrospinal fluid as a result of damage to the
central nervous tissue in CJD and in BSE. These changes may be disease
specific and their detection could be a useful means of diagnosis or
differential diagnosis. Work is continuing to produce a diagnostic test
using these proteins.
However, it is likely that any such test would only detect late stage
infection when clinical signs are imminent or apparent.
9. Other tests in the live sheep
The VLA is currently validating the ICE (capillary immunoelectrophoresis)
blood test developed by Dr Mary Jo Schmerr of the USDA for use in the field
in a PrPSc screening programme. Laboratories at Weybridge and Langford in
Bristol have commenced a 3 year field project in liaison with the USDA.
The major obstacle appears to be in the purification and preparation of the
blood samples which is currently taking 24 hours. Also reagent
standardisation is creating difficulties.
However, things are looking hopeful in developing this test to identify the
at risk flocks as part of a national screening programme. This involves a
timeframe of 3 -- 5 years.
The work on testing for the detection of disease specific protein
metabolites in either the urine or cerebrospinal fluid does not promise any
useful solutions at present or the short term.

EU update on BSE, June 2002
---------------------------
Speaking note by David Byrne, EU Commissioner for Health and Consumer
Protection, at the Agriculture Council, Luxembourg, 27 Jun 2002:
1.Incidence of BSE
The overall incidence of BSE in the Community is stable. The very extensive
range of testing being carried out is providing hugely valuable
information. I would point to the following in particular. Rapid tests now
account for about 2 out of 3 of BSE cases detected. Most cases of BSE are
found in at risk animals. About one in every 1000 animals in this category
test positive for BSE. This compares with a rate of one per 30 000 in the
tests on healthy cattle. The youngest case of BSE this year was in an
animal aged 31 months in the UK which was an emergency slaughter. The
youngest case in a healthy animal was an animal aged 49 months in France.
The overall level is stable or falling in all member states with the
exceptions of Spain and Ireland. This is clearly a cause of concern,
especially in Ireland where the incidence has risen particularly strongly.
However, the age profile of cases of Ireland and the seasonal pattern in
cases observed in recent years suggests that the incidence should now begin
to fall. Moreover,the changes under consideration at the OIE and EU level
in relation to BSE classification also suggest that there is currently no
need for additional safeguard measures. The situation is, of course, being
closely monitored in the Standing Committee.
2.Legislative proposals
The Standing Committee has discussed if there is any need to change the
existing testing requirements in the light of the test results outlined
above. The consensus view is that they should remain unchanged. This
relates in particular to the age limit of 30 months for healthy cattle and
24 months for at risk cattle.
However, a number of issues remain to be fully clarified before the
Commission makes any formal proposals to the Standing Committee. Similarly,
the Commission is continuing its discussions with your veterinary experts
on the classification criteria for BSE, especially for third countries.
3. Incidence of Scrapie
As you are aware, new testing requirements in relation to TSEs in sheep
entered into force from 1 Apr this year. The results of these tests are
already coming on stream. These tests are essential to establish a more
accurate picture of the true incidence of TSEs in the sheep population in
the Community. The Commission suspects that this incidence is underreported
and the test results to date tend to confirm this suspicion.
The Commission has asked member states to report monthly on the results of
tests. Reliable information on the true incidence of TSEs in sheep is
essential for a credible response if BSE is ever found to have transmitted
to sheep in natural conditions.
4. Scientific Findings
The work of the Scientific Steering Committee remains instrumental to our
framework of protective measures in relation to BSE. Since we last met,the
SSC has adopted a further opinion on the safety of vertebral column. This
opinion suggests that animals born after the date of the total feed ban, 01
Jan 2001, should bear a low risk of being affected.
The Commission is considering the implications of this opinion for a
possible raising of the age limit of the requirement to remove vertebral
column from the current limit of 12 months. The critical issue in this
respect is the effectiveness of the total ban.
An opinion of the SSC on the safety of sheep intestine is also awaited. I
had hoped that it would be available this week. However, research underway
in the Netherlands, considered essential by the SSC to its opinion, has
still not been concluded. I know that both the French and UK authorities
are of the view that the entire intestine of sheep should indeed be added
to the list of SRMs. I appreciate their patience in awaiting a Commission
proposal in the matter and would like to ask for this patience to continue
for a few more months.
5.National Measures
I would like to mention the measure scheduled to enter into force on 1 Jul
in France in relation to spinal cord. This measure requires the removal of
spinal cord at 6 months, rather than 12 months as required under Community
law. I understand that our new colleague Herve Gaymard has been in
consultations with his ministerial colleagues on the proposal and would
like to invite him to update the Council on Frances intentions.
Similarly,he may wish to update us on the judgement of the Court of Justice
on the continued ban on the import of British beef and beef products. The
Commission must respect its Treaty obligations to uphold Community law and
has therefore called on France to bring its national measures into
conformity with the Court Judgement.
6. Food and Veterinary Office
The Food and Veterinary Office (FVO) of the Commission is continuing its
current round of missions in the Member States to evaluate the
implementation of measures in relation to BSE. The final reports on these
missions will be available shortly. The previous reports of the FVO have
proven invaluable in highlighting where improvements are necessary. I would
ask therefore that you look at the FVOs findings in this light and take
immediate action to address the weaknesses identified. The FVO is similarly
very advanced in the range of missions in relation to BSE in the candidate
countries. There is the need for a considerable catch-up to bring their
measures fully in line with the EU acquis on BSE. This is especially so now
that BSE has been confirmed in several of the candidate countries, most
recently Poland.
While continued progress is being made, especially in relation to the
introduction of testing, the Commission is maintaining the pressure for
even greater efforts.
Inspections have also recently taken place or are planned in third
countries which export significant quantities of beef to the EU, notably
Brazil, Uruguay, and Argentina. This is in keeping with the Commissions
commitment to ensure that the same high level of security applies to
imports as to product produced in the EU.
7. Meat and Bone Meal (MBM)
I have spoken on a number of previous occasions on the Commissions
concerns that MBM is safely transported, stored, and destroyed. This
concern is due to the huge increase in stocks now that MBM is banned in
animal feedingstuffs.
Several member states have encountered problems in dealing with this
increase. While this is understandable, it does not provide an excuse for
undue delay in taking the necessary measures to tackle the problem.
The Commission has recently taken the initiative to write to member states.
Firstly,to provide clarification on the requirements in relation to MBM;
secondly, to request details of the measures being taken by MS to dispose
of MBM.
I would appreciate if you could ask your services to provide the Commission
with the information requested as soon as possible. On the basis of this
information,I propose to update the Council in the Autumn on the overall
situation in relation to MBM.
Hopefully, by the autumn, the Commission will also be in a better position
to advise on the use of ruminant fat in animal feed, in particular calf
milk replacers. The SSC is scheduled to adopt an opinion in the matter in
September which should clarify if further measures at the EU level are
necessary.

Survey discovers no cases of BSE in China
-----------------------------------------
No cases of mad cow disease were detected in Chinese cattle in the largest
national survey of livestock ever carried out by the agriculture ministry.
Health officials also gave the country a clean bill of health by reporting
that no cases of the human form of the illness had been diagnosed in China.
"In line with the standards of Office International des Epizooties (OIE),
we have examined 1863 brain tissues of deceased cattle from farms and
slaughterhouses throughout China since last May, and all the test results
were negative," said Zhao Weining, division director of the Ministry of
Agriculture.
The ministry has just published its "2001 BSE Monitoring Report", which
gives a detailed analysis of how the tests were carried out and information
on bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE).
China has at least 132 million heads of cattle in stock, and has introduced
nearly 6000 cows from abroad since 1992, statistics from the ministry
revealed. To ascertain whether the animals have mad cow disease symptoms,
the ministry mandated early last year that all 31 provinces, autonomous
regions, and municipalities should each send 50 to 100 cattle brain tissues
to the National BSE Test Centre in East China's Shandong Province or the
Beijing-based Chinese University of Agriculture.
"We collected and tested brain tissues of cows that were ageing, reported
decreased milk production, loss of body weight or found to have symptoms
such as nervousness or twitching and had been cleared of other diseases,"
said Zhao Deming, director of the Institute of Laboratory Animals under the
Chinese University of Agriculture.
The year-long work has helped scientists and government officials get an
accurate picture of the health situation of cows in China, he said. The
nationwide survey was conducted to follow a landmark BSE risk analysis the
ministry conducted in 2000, in which it concluded that the risk of BSE
occurring in China was extremely low.
The latest findings have further supported that conclusion, the director
said; early protection systems put into place in China have been largely
responsible for keeping BSE out of the country, he added. Wang Zhiliang,
director of China National BSE Test Centre, said China will assess and
monitor the BSE situation in its cattle sector for 7 years consecutively,
in line with relevant OIE stipulations.
In addition to cattle, the country will gauge the health of sheep next
year, to make sure the country is free from scrapie, which is a fatal
progressive neurological disorder of sheep and goats and is related to BSE.

[The Chinese statement, like similar statements from other non-EU countries
on their BSE status, requires some caution. The objective, scientific
evaluation of the actual BSE status of a country appears to be a complex
issue -- certainly when accurate figures on imports of MBM, live animals,
and other animal products since 1980(!) are not specified or not available.
The OIE guidelines for member-countries' self-assessment are presented in
appendix 3.8.3. of the International Animal Health Code -- "Surveillance
and monitoring systems for bovine spongiform encephalopathy". The said
document specifies the minimal numbers (according to statistical
requirements) of brain examinations from various cattle subgroups which
have to be annually performed according to the respective size of the
cattle populations. See <http://www.oie.int/eng/normes/MCode/A_00154.htm>.
Those guidelines may be subject to revision.
A comprehensive, science-based programme for the assessment of the BSE risk
in EU and "third" countries, has been developed by the Scientific Steering
Committee (SSC) of the EU under the title "geographic BSE risk" (GBR). The
GBR status of 58 countries has already been agreed upon by the SSC
following the completion of their respective evaluations in line with the
programme's principles. Additional information, including the definition of
the four GBR levels, can be found in item [6] of this ProMED-mail BSE
update. An update of the opinion of the SSC on GBR, adopted on 11 Jan 2002,
can be seen at <http://europa.eu.int/comm/food/fs/sc/ssc/out243_en.pdf>. -
