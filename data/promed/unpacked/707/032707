The canton of Neuchâtel is experiencing a measles outbreak. In one month, the Cantonal Public Health Service became aware of 7 cases of this contagious viral disease. Measures to keep children [that are not vaccinated] away have been declared.

On 18 Jan 2018, Vaud [canton] health authorities informed the Neuchâtel cantonal doctor of a case of measles in a 6 year old child who was residing in the canton of Vaud, but attending a Neuchâtel school. Despite control measures, 6 new cases were reported.

Those infected are 2 adults employed in a company and 4 young children attending a childcare facility. Vaud health authorities identified the people in contact with the sick child during the contagious period.

Those unvaccinated against measles were removed from the community for 21 days, the canton of Neuchâtel said on Wed 21 Feb 2018. This measure is necessary and must be applied as required by the law on epidemics. The cantonal doctor says that measles is one of the most contagious viral diseases.

Measles cases skyrocketed across Europe last year [2017], with the highest number recorded in Romania and Italy, where populists have stoked fears about vaccinations. In Europe, cases surged by 400 per cent, with more than 2000 people infected and 35 people dying from measles. Over half of all measles cases were recorded in Romania and Italy.

In 2017, there were 5006 cases of measles in Italy, a 488 per cent increase compared with the previous year [2017]. The number of cases in the 1st 3 months of last year surpassed the total in 2016. More than 80 per cent of Italy's measles cases involved people who had not been vaccinated. Italy's measles immunisation rate of 87 per cent is much lower than the 95 per cent threshold recommended by the World Health Organisation (WHO).

The alarming rise has been linked to the surging influence of 2 populist parties who have strong ties with the anti-vaccination movement. Ahead of the Italian general election in March [2018], the far-right Northern League party and Five Star Movement (M5S) have vowed to scrap a vaccination law.

The parties have both proposed revoking the law, which states that children cannot enroll in a crèche [nursery, day care center] unless they have been vaccinated against measles and 9 other infectious diseases. Under the current law, parents who do not get their child vaccinated can be fined up to 500 euros [about USD 612].

In January [2018], Northern League leader Matteo Salvini told reporters that the MMR [measles, mumps, rubella] jab should be optional. "Vaccinations yes, obligation no," he said. M5S's leader, Luigi Di Maio, echoed that position. In the past, M5S has highlighted what it called the "dangers of vaccinations".

"Mass vaccination is a gift to multinational pharma and it is the furthest thing there is to an appropriate approach," a party statement in October 2015 read.

Italy's former prime minister, Matteo Renzi, condemned the populist proposal. "You don't mess around with vaccines. The health of our children is at stake, not an extra [percentage] point at the polls. We are on the side of science, research, and medicine and won't turn back," he said. The last major measles outbreak in Italy was in 2002 when 60 000 people were infected and 6 died. The Italian government introduced an immunisation programme in 2005 to eliminate measles, but vaccination rates in Italy have been declining steadily since the country's anti-vaccination movement started gathering momentum in 2012.

HSE [Health Service Executive] confirm the number of measles cases are on the rise in Limerick as 15 cases have been reported in the city. It is understood the announcement comes after the health authority revealed that 15 cases have been reported in the region since the beginning of the year [2018].

Although a disease outbreak control team has been sent to the region, the HSE are advising those living the region to make sure they are vaccinated in order to prevent further spread of the illness. In announcement made on its website the health authority revealed that many of the cases were reported in the Ballinacurra Weston and Carew Park area of the city. They also say those who have not been vaccinated should get vaccinated immediately.

Only 2 of the 20 people infected with measles following an outbreak in Limerick city were vaccinated against the disease. 9 cases involved children aged 0-5, none of whom was vaccinated. 4 were hospitalised.

Of the remaining 11 cases among 15-34 year olds, just 2 had received the MMR (measles-mumps-rubella) vaccine. 4 of this cohort were also hospitalised.

Two doses of the MMR vaccine are recommended to protect against measles, one at age 12-15 months, and a 2nd between the ages of 4 and 5. In the case of the Limerick outbreak, 18 people had not received any dose.

The outbreak, which began in January [2018], was imported by a patient who had travelled to the Middle East over Christmas [2017]. 19 cases have been confirmed in Limerick City since January. There is also a case in Dublin linked to the outbreak.

The HSE's outbreak control team has been rolling out mobile vaccination clinics over the past few weeks, targeting 2 specific areas in Limerick city with which most of the cases are associated [see source URL for where clinics will be held]. Official immunisation uptake statistics for the 1st dose of MMR show uptake in Limerick city and county has been consistently below the target of 95 per cent which the World Health Organisation recommends for effective immunity within a population. This level of vaccination protects those who cannot be vaccinated by reason of age, pregnancy or illness. MMR uptake at 24 months of age is 88 per cent in Limerick and 93 per cent for the mid west.

Public health specialists have warned that the threat of outbreaks persists as long as there are immunity gaps within the population. Mai Mannix, director of public health in the mid west says: "MMR vaccine is the safest way that parents can protect their children against measles." Dr Mannix said parents in Limerick City and county, Clare, and North Tipperary should ensure their children are fully vaccinated for MMR and bring them for vaccination if they have not had the correct number of doses for their age. If people are unsure of their vaccination status they are advised to get an MMR vaccine, as a 3rd dose is not harmful.

Measles is a viral illness that is spread through direct contact and through the air. It is highly contagious and is spread easily. One case of measles can infect 15-20 unvaccinated people. Symptoms include high fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes, and a rash that starts on the head and spreads.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1391812/65pc-of-measles-cases-in-eastern-mediterranean-region-were-from-pakistan-who


More than 65 per cent of the total measles cases reported in the eastern Mediterranean region, consisting of 22 countries, were reported from Pakistan in 2017. According to a World Health Organisation report, a total of 6494 measles cases were reported in 2017, which is more than double those reported in 2016. Health experts say the actual number of cases may be higher as many cases in Pakistan are not reported, mostly due to the weak surveillance system.

However, Ministry of National Health Services (NHS) director general Dr Asad Hafeez said a measles outbreak is observed every 8 to 10 years and that the ministry has decided to give 35 million doses of measles vaccines to children who are under the age of 5 in September [2018].

Measles is a contagious respiratory infection caused by a virus. It causes rashes on the whole body and flu-like symptoms including fever, cough, and a runny nose. The virus spreads through the air via coughing and sneezing and can be fatal for children.

The WHO report, which is available with Dawn, says that 10 540 tests for measles were conducted in Pakistan in 2017, while 5871 laboratory tests were conducted in 2016. It shows that 6494 cases were confirmed last year [2017] and 2845 were confirmed in 2016. The report also shows that more than 65 per cent of cases reported in the eastern Mediterranean region were from Pakistan while the 2nd highest number of cases was reported from Afghanistan at 1511, and the 3rd from Syria (13 cases). There were 402 diagnosed cases of measles in Saudi Arabia, 146 in Somalia, 166 in Yemen, 87 in UAE, 40 in Iran, and 21 in Iraq. Not a single case was reported in Jordan and Bahrain while Djibouti did not report for 2016 and 2017.

A health expert from the National Institute of Health said the increasing number of measles cases is an indicator of the weak routine immunisation system in the country. "The country experienced a measles outbreak some 8 years ago during which over 10 000 cases were reported and 150 children had died. The year 2018 can be worse and the number of cases may increase further," he said.

The official explained that countries which have a less than 90 per cent rate of routine immunisation are more exposed to measles and that the vaccine coverage in Pakistan is around 50 per cent. He said a large number of cases are never reported in Pakistan due to the weak surveillance system and that the actual number of measles cases will therefore be much higher. "We should have done an intervention at the start of 2017 but no one bothered to do so. The chances of an outbreak will increase after April as the virus becomes more active in the warmer temperatures," he said.

Dr Hafeez said 5-6 million children are born every year in Pakistan and that vaccines for the virus are administered at 9 months, which means a large number of children are not covered for 9 months, which is in addition to the children who are not administered the vaccines at all. "We conduct campaigns in the village where a case is reported from but [the way to mitigate the risk] is to vaccinate all children at once across the country for which USD 25 million to USD 30 million are required. On the other hand, vaccines are prepared on special order. We have arranged for funds with the support of WHO, Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation and the federal and provincial ministries in order to purchase 35 million doses of the vaccine," he said. He added that because an anti-measles campaign cannot be started in the warmer season, it has been decided to start the campaign in September [2018] after which Pakistan will be safe from an outbreak for another 8 to 10 years. "Efforts are also being made to improve the immunisation rate in order to ensure the country is rid of measles for good," he said.

A teacher [from Victoria] has been slammed for seemingly supporting the spreading of measles among children. The teacher, who is a member of the Australia: Childcare for Unvaccinated Children Facebook page, was responding to a parent's post about measles when she made the controversial comment, the Herald Sun reports. The parent wrote, "With the recent measles outbreak near Dandenong [Melbourne], please contact/message me if your children get measles and you are happy to share." To which the private school teacher said, "Same plz!"

A measles outbreak has been reported in Melbourne's south east, with chief health officer Brett Sutton issuing a warning to the public. "The department is attempting to contact people who may have been in contact with the individual while they were infectious," he said.

Another measles outbreak has been reported in western Sydney, with 23 confirmed cases of measles in New South Wales.

The measles vaccine is free and the Australian Medical Association (AMA) recommends all children and adults have 2 doses of the vaccine during their lifetimes. AMA president Dr Michael Gannon says the federal government's "No Jab, No Pay" policy has led to 200 000 children being fully vaccinated but has asked doctors to do more to reach out to parents hesitant to vaccinate their kids.

Measles is a highly infectious viral disease that can have serious complications. Symptoms include fever, tiredness, runny nose, cough, and sore red eyes. These symptoms normally appear a few days before a red blotchy rash.

[The parent and teacher were referring to the concept of "measles parties". At these gatherings, kids who haven't been immunized would be exposed to the disease so that they would become infected and thus "build up" immunity. It's similar to the idea behind "chickenpox parties", which were highly popular among parents before the pox vaccine was introduced in the United States in 1995.

But intentionally exposing your kids to measles -- a serious and highly contagious illness -- is harmful. Public health officials warned parents against the "natural infection" practice back in 2015, saying that the tactic unnecessarily places the exposed children at potentially grave risk and could contribute to further spread of the outbreak.

People with measles can be very sick for 7-10 days, with symptoms that include a high fever, cough, sore throat, and rash. And a small number of children who get measles develop severe complications from the disease, including brain infections that can cause permanent neurological damage. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1-2 children die from the disease for every 1000 who get it. The risk of severe disease following natural infection is much greater and more life threatening than anything that is seen following vaccination. - Mod.LK

An Australian tourist who has measles made contact with 32 people when he visited New York City this month [February 2018], according to the city's Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. Last week of 19 Feb 2018, the New York State Department of Health issued a measles warning after the tourist visited several sites in the city, as well as in Orange and Putnam Counties, between 16-21 Feb 2018.

Those sites included the Metropolitan Museum of Art in Manhattan as part of an Oasis Bible Tour group, the Watchtower Educational Center in Putnam County, an Orange County hotel, the Urgent Care Center in Orange County, and Orange Regional Medical Center's Emergency Department.

"We have a list of now 32 contacts... it's not a large number by our standards, and every one of these people have been contacted by the Health Department," Dr Jane Zucker, the city Health Department's assistant commissioner who heads the immunization bureau, told Observer on Monday afternoon [26 Feb 2018]. "There was one person we were unable to reach, but we will continue to try." She noted that not all of the individuals who made contact with the tourist live in the city but that the city has notified the appropriate jurisdictions. The Health Department, she explained, provided affected individuals with relevant information and offered support for individuals who did not know whether or not they had been vaccinated.

"At the hotel, we can't identify every guest, but all of the guests at the hotel did receive notification," Zucker continued, adding that they made sure everyone had immunity. "We worked with the hotel to have notification [sent] to the hotel. Everyone who stayed at the hotel the same dates that the individual was there and the other people who we know had exposure that work at the hotel." She also said the state notified other states in the event that other individuals were visiting the city at the time and that her staff has been notifying individuals "very quickly". However, she warned the number of affected individuals could be much higher. "Potentially, it's a much larger number," Zucker added.

The last time New York City had a measles case was in May 2017, according to Zucker. In 2013, a measles outbreak hit 2 orthodox Jewish neighborhoods in Brooklyn. None of the 58 individuals were vaccinated at the time. She maintained that it is too early to tell whether any of the 32 individuals who made contact with the tourist have measles given that there is a 10-12 day incubation period for the disease.

In New York state, measles immunization is required for children enrolled in schools, daycare, and pre-kindergarten, according to the state Health Department. Since August 1990, college students have also been required to show that they are immune against measles. "If there's any good news, it's that we have very good, what we would call 'high population immunity' in New York City," Zucker said. "A lot of people are really immune."

Measles is a highly contagious disease caused by a virus spread via direct contact with nasal or throat secretions of infected people, according to the state Health Department. Individuals first develop a fever, then may have a cough, runny nose, and watery eyes, and finally, a rash appears.

The state Health Department says the best way to prevent measles is to get vaccinated, recommending 2 doses of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine.

Roughly 91 per cent of children aged 19-35 months received the vaccination in 2016, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). From 1-27 Jan 2018, 9 people from 4 states -- Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana and Texas -- were reported to have measles, said CDC. In 2017, 118 people from 15 states and Washington DC had measles, compared with 86 people from 19 states in 2016 and 188 people from 24 states and DC in 2015. And in 2014, the United States saw a record number of measles cases, with 667 cases from 27 states -- the highest number since measles was eliminated in the United States in 2000.

Watchtower Educational Center told Observer in a statement that it immediately informed its personnel at all of its complexes about the tourist's contact with the center and distributed a fact sheet from the state Health Department. Individuals with symptoms were directed to infirmary staff. "We identified any [individuals] who had direct contact with the infected visitor, and they were given further information and support as needed," the center said. "We have been cooperating closely with the Health Department in doing all that is needed to protect our staff and any visitors."

A representative for La Quinta Inn -- an Upper West Side hotel the tourist visited -- told Observer the state Health Department asked them to keep all communications related to the matter confidential. The other 5 locations visited by the tourist did not immediately respond to requests for comment on [Mon 26 Feb 2018].

Measles is making comeback on the heels of the anti-vaxxer movement. See https://www.historyofvaccines.org/content/graph-us-measles-cases for a graph depicting measles cases from 1954-2008. While the US is unlikely to return to 800 000 cases per year as occurred in 1956, in 2014, as reported above, the United States saw a record number of measles cases, with 667 cases from 27 states -- the highest number since measles was eliminated in the United States in 2000. - Mod.LK]
