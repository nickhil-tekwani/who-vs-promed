Health officials in Iowa and Minnesota on Wed, 13 Dec 2006, confirmed a
link between _Escherichia coli_ [O157:H7] outbreaks at Taco John's
restaurants that have sickened dozens of customers.
Officials also said that the cause of the outbreak -- which has sickened at
least 50 people in Iowa and 27 in Minnesota -- has been tied to lettuce
served at Taco John's in 3 cities. Genetic tests linked the cases, health
officials said.
"It's essentially a DNA fingerprint," said Kevin Teale, a spokesman for the
Iowa Department of Public Health. "(The tests) tell us that what's making
people sick in Iowa is exactly the same as what's making people sick in
Minnesota."
Findings from state health officials also confirmed that the _E. coli_
outbreak is not linked to any other illnesses in the USA, including an
outbreak in the north east associated with Taco Bell restaurants.
Preliminary test results this week showed that dozens of Iowans who ate at
a Taco John's restaurant in Cedar Falls were likely victims of _E. coli_
infection. The outbreak has sent at least 18 people to hospital. Minnesota
officials now suspect 27 cases of _E. coli_, with 5 cases confirmed by
state health officials. The Minnesota cases have been linked to 2 Taco
John's restaurants near the Iowa border, in Austin and Albert Lea.
Officials believe the _E. coli_ outbreak in Iowa has been contained, but
Teale said case numbers were increasing after media coverage and follow up
interviews by health officials. Officials will now try to trace where the
outbreak started, a process Teale portrayed as a lengthy and potentially
difficult process. "It's an extensive trackback process," Teale said.
"We'll look and see what food distributor served the restaurant ... and
then we'll look at the wholesaler."
The Taco John's chain has 430 restaurants in 26 states, Dixon said. He said
the stores are independently owned and get produce and other food through
the parent company.
