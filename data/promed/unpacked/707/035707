Euro Foods, a Freeland, PA establishment, is recalling approximately 119 091 pounds of salame stick products that may be contaminated with _Salmonella_, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today [10 Nov 2021]. FSIS issued a public health alert for the salame stick products on 29 Oct 2021, believing that the product was no longer in commerce. However, following this alert, FSIS observed product available at 1 retail location and 2 Citterio salame stick samples previously collected by the California Department of Public Health have tested positive for _Salmonella_.

The Italian-style salame stick items were produced prior to 25 Oct 2021. The following products are subject to recall [https://www.fsis.usda.gov/sites/default/files/food_label_pdf/2021-11/042-2021-label.pdf]:
- 2-oz. packages containing Citterio "Premium Italian-Style Salame Sticks ALL NATURAL" with "best by" dates through 23 Jan 2022, located next to the barcode.

The products subject to recall bear establishment number "EST. 4010" inside the USDA mark of inspection. These items were shipped to retail locations nationwide and exported to Bermuda.

FSIS has been working with the CDC and state public health partners to investigate a multistate outbreak of 31 _Salmonella_ I 4,[5],12:i:- illnesses in 10 states with onset dates ranging from 18 Sep 2021 through 18 Oct 2021. The epidemiologic and traceback investigation identified that ill people consumed Citterio Italian-style Salame Sticks produced by Euro Foods Inc. Two unopened, intact, packages of Citterio Italian-style Salame Sticks collected by the California Department of Public Health as part of the ongoing investigation tested positive for _Salmonella_. Further testing is ongoing to determine if the product samples are related to the outbreak. FSIS continues to work with federal and state public health partners to determine if there are additional illnesses linked to these products.

Consumption of food contaminated with _Salmonella_ can cause salmonellosis, one of the most common bacterial foodborne illnesses. The most common symptoms of salmonellosis are diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and fever within 6 hours to 6 days after eating the contaminated product. The illness usually lasts 4 to 7 days. Most people recover without treatment. In some persons, however, the diarrhea may be so severe that the patient needs to be hospitalized. Older adults, infants, and persons with weakened immune systems are more likely to develop a severe illness. Individuals concerned about an illness should contact their health care provider.

FSIS is concerned that some product may be in consumers' pantries or refrigerators. Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the FSIS website at <www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls>.

[Ten more cases have been added and the formal recall issued. It is not clear as yet if the isolates from the suspected vehicle are indeed the same serotype.

As a review, _Salmonella_ as a genus has 2 species, _enterica_ and _bongori_. _S. enterica_ is divided into 6 subspecies: _enterica_, _salamae_, _arizonae_, _diarizonae_, _houtenae_, and _indica_. _S. enterica_ subspecies _enterica_ (or subspecies I) strains are the ones usually isolated from humans or warm-blooded animals and represent a majority of the salmonellas that are clinically important.

The designation _Salmonella_ I 4,[5],12:i:- means:
- the "I" reflects subspecies _enterica_;
- the "4,[5],12" are the O (or somatic) antigens associated with the organism. An O antigen underscored or placed in [ ] can refer to whether the antigen is related to phage conversion;
- the nomenclature after the colon, in this case i:-, reflects the flagellar or H antigens. - Mod.LL
