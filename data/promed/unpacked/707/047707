Rocky Mountain spotted fever is not an uncommon disease, and is seen here in
Southwestern Ohio, particularly in Clermont County, as well as in many areas
in Indiana. Indifference to tick bites by the general population is often
seen. While the disease is endemic, there are certain climatic conditions
which seem to enhance its appearance. Some years we'll see more patients than
others. Its a reportable disease, and a note to the newspaper is valuable in
educating the public. New physicians to an area should certainly be aware of
this diseases, which have nothing to do with a virus.
An article in Arch Intern Med (2003; 163:769-74) entitled Rocky Mountain
Spotted Fever: A clinician's dilemma by E J Masters & colleagues from Cape
Giradeau, MO, listed common errors in diagnosis. The abstract below is
reparagraphed for ease of reading:
"Rocky Mountain spotted fever is still the most lethal tick-vectored illness
in the United States. We examine the dilemmas facing the clinician who is
evaluating the patient with possible Rocky Mountain spotted fever, with
particular attention to the following 8 pitfalls in diagnosis and treatment:
(1) waiting for a petechial rash to develop before diagnosis;
(2) misdiagnosing as gastroenteritis;
(3) discounting a diagnosis when there is no history of a tick bite;
(4) using an inappropriate geographic exclusion;
(5) using an inappropriate seasonal exclusion;
(6) failing to treat on clinical suspicion;
(7) failing to elicit an appropriate history; and
(8) failing to treat with doxycycline.
Early diagnosis and proper treatment save lives. The usual drug of choice,
doxycycline is readily available in generic, used at 100 mg bid, and should
be known by most physicians. Concurrent tick-borne infections should be
considered, e.g. ehrlichiosis and Lyme disease in other areas, but
tetracycline/doxycycline treats them as well.
