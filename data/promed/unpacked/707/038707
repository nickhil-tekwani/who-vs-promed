In September 2007 at Masagua, Escuintla Department, Guatemala,
uredial lesions that appeared different from those of brown rust were
observed on a sugarcane (a complex hybrid of _Saccharum_ L. species)
cultivar (CP 72-2086) considered resistant to brown rust caused by
_Puccinia melanocephala_ Syd. and P. Syd. Samples were sent to the
USDA-ARS Systematic Mycology and Microbiology Laboratory in
Beltsville, MD, for identification.

Observed morphological features were consistent with _Puccinia kuehnii_
E.J. Butler and appeared similar to orange rust samples obtained from
Florida in July [2007]. Uredinial lesions were hypophyllous, orange,
and variable in size measuring 650 - 850 by 26 - 32 micrometers.
Urediniospores were mostly obovoid to pyriform or broadly
ellipsoidal, variable in size, 32 - 45 by 25 - 30 micrometers, and
moderately echinulate with spines evenly distributed, 3 - 5
micrometers apart. Urediniospore walls were orange to light cinnamon
brown, 1 - 2.5 micrometers thick with a pronounced apical wall and 4
to 5 equatorial pores. Telia and teliospores were not observed.

The nuclear large subunit rDNA [ribosomal DNA] region of the rust
infecting cv. CP 72-2086 and 3 other rDNA regions were sequenced. DNA
sequences matched sequences of _P. kuehnii_ in GenBank [universal
nucleotide sequences database] and were distinct from known sequences
of _P. melanocephala_ available in GenBank. 13 cultivars were
rated as to their relative resistance using severity of orange rust
symptoms; 5 were resistant, 5 were intermediate, and 3 were susceptible.

Orange rust was previously reported in Florida, but to our knowledge,
this is the 2nd report of its occurrence in the Western Hemisphere.

[Symptoms of _P. kuehnii_ orange rust on sugarcane are minute,
elongated yellow lesions which develop an orange to orange-brown
color as they expand. Most rust pustules occur on the lower leaf
surface with more lesions toward the leaf base. Wind can rapidly
spread the pathogen. Environmental conditions conducive for the
development of orange rust include warm, humid summers and cool
autumns. The disease has the potential to cause significant economic
losses to sugarcane crops.

Sugarcane brown (common) rust caused by _P. melanocephala_ occurs in
the USA, Ecuador, Colombia, Australia, Mauritius and possibly
elsewhere. Yield losses depend on environmental conditions and may be
in the range of 10 - 40 percent. Disease management for both rusts
includes fungicide treatments and, in the long-term, development and
planting of resistant cane varieties suitable to local requirements.

An outbreak of orange rust reported in Florida in July 2007 (see
ProMED-mail post 20070731.2457) was the 1st record of _P. kuehnii_ in
the western hemisphere. The presence of this pathogen is potentially
very serious for the industry in the region, especially since,
unfortunately, it was discovered too late for local containment and
eradication to be feasible. Two possible explanations for the
emergence of orange rust in the Americas are:
a. A less virulent strain of the pathogen has been present
previously, but has recently mutated into a more aggressive strain.
This scenario occurred in Australia in 2000, where a new strain of
orange rust caused extensive yield losses in susceptible varieties.
b. The pathogen was introduced recently.

It appears that symptoms of orange rust were observed at similar
times in Florida and Guatemala, although Florida was 1st to report.
The exact degree of similarity of the Florida and Guatemala isolates
is not given in the report above, and rust spores are easily spread
for example by wind (eastward) or by travellers and trade. It is
therefore not clear whether both outbreaks are to be attributed to
spread of a new strain and in which geographical direction, or to
separate mutations or incursions in both places.
