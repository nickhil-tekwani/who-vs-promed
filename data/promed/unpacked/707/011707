The Netherlands: Transmission of Avian Influenza A (H7N7) Virus to Humans
---------------------------------------------------
[The summary section of a paper from the Lancet of 21 Feb 2004, describing
the avian influenza A (H7N7) outbreak in fowl in the Netherlands in 2003,
is reproduced here because it is relevant to discussion of risk of
transmission of avian influenza viruses to humans and onward transmission
of the avian viruses from human to human. The full text of the paper is
available free using the above URL. - Mod.CP]
Reference
---------
Transmission of H7N7 avian influenza A virus to human beings during a large
outbreak in commercial poultry farms in the Netherlands. By Marion Koopmans
and 11 others at the Diagnostic Laboratory for Infectious Diseases and
Perinatal Screening, and Centre for Infectious Diseases Epidemiology,
National Institute of Public Health and the Environment, Bilthoven,
Netherlands; European Influenza Surveillance Scheme at Netherlands
Institute for Health Services Research, Utrecht; Virology Department,
Erasmus Medical Centre, Rotterdam; National Coordination Centre for
Communicable Disease Control, Utrecht; and Municipal Health Centre, Arnhem.
Background
----------
An outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza A virus subtype H7N7
started at the end of February, 2003, in commercial poultry farms in the
Netherlands. Although the risk of transmission of these viruses to humans
was initially thought to be low, an outbreak investigation was launched to
assess the extent of transmission of influenza A virus subtype H7N7 from
chickens to humans.
Methods
-------
All workers in poultry farms, poultry farmers, and their families were
asked to report signs of conjunctivitis or influenza-like illness. People
with complaints were tested for influenza A virus subtype H7 (A/H7)
infection and completed a health questionnaire about type of symptoms,
duration of illness, and possible exposures to infected poultry.
Findings
--------
453 people had health complaints; 349 reported conjunctivitis, 90 had
influenza-like illness, and 67 had other complaints. We detected A/H7 in
conjunctival samples from 78 (26.4 percent) of people with conjunctivitis
only, in 5 (9.4 percent) with influenza-like illness and conjunctivitis, in
2 (5.4 percent) with influenza-like illness only, and in 4 (6 percent) who
reported other symptoms. Most positive samples had been collected within 5
days of symptom onset. A/H7 infection was confirmed in 3 contacts (of 83
tested), one of whom developed influenza-like illness. 6 people had
influenza A/H3N2 infection. After 19 people had been diagnosed with the
infection, all workers received mandatory influenza virus vaccination and
prophylactic treatment with oseltamivir. More than half (56 percent) of
A/H7 infections reported here arose before the vaccination and treatment
programme.
Interpretation
--------------
We noted an unexpectedly high number of transmissions of avian influenza A
(H7N7) virus to people directly involved in handling infected poultry, and
we noted evidence for person-to-person transmission. Our data emphasise the
importance of adequate surveillance, outbreak preparedness, and pandemic
planning.
