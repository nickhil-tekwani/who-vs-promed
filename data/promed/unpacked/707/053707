Rabies creeps closer to the Swiss border
----------------------------------------
An outbreak of rabies in northern Italy has neighbouring Switzerland
preparing for the worst, according to the Federal Veterinary Office.
While the affected area is around 100 km [62 miles] from the Swiss
border, officials are keeping a close eye on the situation.
Switzerland has been free of the deadly virus since 1998.

"For the 1st time in a long time, there's the small possibility that
rabies will be re-introduced by foxes," Veterinary Office spokesman
Marcel Falk told swissinfo.ch.

Italy has seen an alarming increase in rabies cases: from 9 in 2008
to 69 in 2009 and 199 in the 1st half of 2010. Most of the affected
animals were foxes, but there were also some dogs, cats, deer and
other mammals. It is believed that virus-carrying foxes wandered into
Italy from eastern Europe, where rabies is quite common.

"In the meantime, Italy has implemented a strong fight against rabies
" so they're really doing a lot at the moment," said Falk.

The Swiss have long been involved in working against the virus. In
the 1960's and 1970's the authorities ordered chicken heads stuffed
with vaccine to be placed on the ground in high-risk countryside areas.

"Switzerland invented the way that rabies is now eradicated," Falk said.

Commercially produced bait has now replaced the bird leftovers. These
brown snack bars have a fishy flavour to conceal the taste of the
medicine. It is the standard way to fight rabies among wild animals,
which are difficult for vets to reach with vaccine shots.

In South Tyrol, Italian wildlife wardens have been busy scattering
the bait. That's not on the agenda in Switzerland yet, but the
authorities say they are prepared to launch a campaign at short notice.

"If you asked me today whether rabies would come to Switzerland or
whether Switzerland would have to start a programme to vaccinate
foxes, I would say probably not. But I would say we are preparing for
the worst-case scenario," said Falk.

Local authorities have increased observation in canton Graubunden's
Munster and lower Engadin valleys, which serve as natural gateways to
Italy. Dead, ill and oddly behaving animals are being sent to vets
for examination. Rabies is also a topic among Graubunden's farmers,
but not necessarily a worry yet.

"For our cows it's not a direct threat. I know of very few cases of
when cows have been infected," Gian Peter Niggli told swissinfo.ch.
He raises Black Angus cattle in Samedan. In summer, the animals head
for the hills to graze. "If rabies was a risk, though, we'd probably
vaccinate against it," said Niggli.

"The risk in general for people or pets hasn't really increased,"
said Falk, pointing out that most nations worldwide are "full of
rabies." He noted that it is an exception when a country is
rabies-free. Falk said that while hikers don't need to take any
special precautions in Switzerland, they should be wary when meeting
local and foreign fauna. "People should always be careful when in
contact with wild animals. If a fox isn't fleeing but approaching
you, then something is wrong," said Falk.

People visiting tropical countries should keep a distance from stray
dogs, cats, monkeys and other animals, according to Safetravel.ch.
The website posts advice from the Federal Health Office and travel
medicine experts. It recommends rabies vaccinations for people who
work with animals or who plan to spend a lot of time in the
wilderness during their travels. Safetravel.ch also suggests
inoculations for travellers spending more than a month in areas where
rabies is a risk.

Meanwhile, the Federal Veterinary Office requires pets entering
Switzerland from abroad to have a valid rabies vaccination; so people
taking Fido and Fluffy on holiday need to plan ahead.
