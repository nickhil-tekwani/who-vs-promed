Some cattle in Rockingham County may have been exposed to epizootic
hemorrhagic disease [EHD], an illness common in white-tailed deer. Dr Brad
Birak, a veterinarian with Ashby Herd Health Services, said tests confirmed
[the presence of] antibodies that fight the virus in the blood of at least
2 cows he treated. He said the cattle also showed other symptoms, including
stiffness when walking, and oral sores causing slobbering and loss of appetite.

But the Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services maintains
there is no proof that cattle can be infected with the virus. The
department said positive blood tests confirm exposure, not infection.

[Although the Department may disagree, there is a close component between
EHD and bluetongue virus. And there is increasing evidence that EHD can
affect cattle. - Mod.TG]
