Environment Council to authorize wild boar capture in Els Ports, for
tuberculosis prevention
--------------------------------------------------
The Environmental Council will advance the wild boar hunting season in Els
Ports national hunting reserve to September [2005], allowing
intensification of their capture rate. This, in order to reduce the wild
boar population and stop dissemination of tuberculosis, which was initially
detected at the end of 2004. The TB infection rate is thought to be quite
high in wild boars. This was confirmed by the head of the Environmental
Services in the Ebro region, Mr. Victor Gimeno, following a meeting
attended by delegates from the Agriculture and Health Secretariats convened
to coordinate the handling of the problem.
Both agencies will implement measures aiming at verifying that the outbreak
is not affecting cattle or humans (hunters who might have had contact with
tuberculous animals). In Lloret Ravine and nearby areas (the affected
region) there is currently a high density of wild boars. Health
authorities are concerned because tuberculosis might affect a high
proportion of these animals, as reflected by the recent results of tests in
samples from wild boars.
"This is the reason for our wish to significantly reduce the wild boar
population. We also advise hunters not to eat hunted animals", explained
Mr. Gimeno yesterday [5 Jul 2005]. In order to verify that there has been
no transmission to people, Health Secretariat will perform tests in 100
hunters from Roquetes and Mas de Barberans communities. The Agriculture
Secretariat also started performing tests in order to determine if the
infection has been disseminated to cattle and goats in the area, and also
to determine whether bad sanitary conditions in these latter animals might
have been the cause of the outbreak.

[Recent observations in Spain showed that _ Mycobacterium tuberculosis_
strains of bovine and caprine origin circulate in the same local wildlife
populations and that 6 out of 11 spoligotypes were similar to types
described in human cases. The authors reported that the isolation of _M.
tuberculosis complex_ strains (belonging either to _M. bovis_ or to _M.
caprae_), in fenced estates, from cervids and wild boars that have not had
contact with domestic livestock for at least 2 decades, strongly suggest
that the _M. tuberculosis complex_ is able to survive in these populations.
They concluded that wildlife needs to be considered in the epidemiology and
control of tuberculosis. (see C Gortazar et al, 2005. Molecular
characterization of _Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex_ isolates from wild
ungulates in south-central Spain. Vet Res. 36(1):43-52).
Wildlife management aimed at reducing the density of susceptible animals
within an infected area may contribute to the control of infectious
diseases in animals and -- if zoonotic -- their spillover to humans. In the
current case, these measures fall in line with the conclusion of the cited
paper. - Mod.AS]
