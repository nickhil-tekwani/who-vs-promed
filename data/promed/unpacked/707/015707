[A 20 Sep 2014 ProMED-mail post (archive no. 20140921.2792201) indicated that CCHF was 1st reported in Pakistan in 1976, but the number of cases has shown a dramatic rise since 2000, with 50-60 patients being reported annually. Nearly 50 cases of the disease have so far been reported from different parts of the country this year (2014). There have been at least 12 suspected and 4 confirmed CCHF cases previously reported in Karachi so far in 2014 (see the archives cited below). CCHF virus is a tickborne virus in the genus _Nairovirus_, family _Bunyaviridae_.

Although the circumstances under which the above individuals acquired their CCHF virus infections are not reported, they may have become infected via a tick bite or exposure to the blood of an infected animal. The virus can cause severe viral hemorrhagic fever outbreaks, with a case fatality rate of 10-40 per cent. The virus is transmitted by _Hyalomma_ spp ticks or through contact with infected human blood or animal blood and tissues during and immediately after slaughter. The majority of cases have occurred in people involved in the livestock industry, such as agricultural workers, slaughterhouse workers, and veterinarians. Exposure in health care facilities also occurs when protection and control measures are inadequate. The length of the incubation period depends on the mode of acquisition of the virus. Following infection by a tick bite, the incubation period is usually 1-3 days, with a maximum of 9 days.
