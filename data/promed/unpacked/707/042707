Bird flu, which has killed one person since it re-emerged in Viet Nam
in early May 2007, has flared up on several farms in a northern
province despite efforts by the government to stop it from spreading.
The Animal Health Department said on Monday [18 Jun 2007] that 690
ducks and chickens died last Thursday and Friday [14,15 Jun 2007] at
8 farms in Bac Giang province, and officials slaughtered the
remaining birds after tests found the dead birds had the H5N1 avian
flu virus.
"Bird flu virus is widely present in the environment and has infected
many poultry flocks. Therefore, it can happen anywhere now," a
government statement quoted Deputy Agriculture Minister Bui Ba Bong
as telling a meeting on Saturday [16 Jun 2007].
At the same meeting, Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung approved an order
to import another batch of 200 million doses of bird flu vaccine to
battle the outbreaks that have struck 16 provinces, including Bac
Giang, and 2 cities.
"It is not encouraged to develop the waterfowl flock. Unvaccinated
ducks are not allowed to roam on fields, and a tight control must be
imposed on (the country's) 70 million ducks," the statement quoted
Dung as saying at the meeting.
The World Health Organization (WHO) described the government as
"committed and alert" to the dangers of bird flu's spread but that
carrying out all effective measures in the provinces was still a
challenge. "There might be a bit of complacency now, and that would
be of concern," Viet Nam representative for the U.N. health agency,
Hans Troedsson, said on Monday [18 Jun 2007].
Viet Nam's program of poultry vaccination and other measures has been
described by international health experts as a model for keeping the
H5N1 virus at bay, but this year [2007], it has spread nationwide in
ducks and chickens.
Health officials on Saturday [16 Jun 2007] confirmed bird flu killed a
20-year-old man on 10 Jun 2007. Troedsson said he was "not surprised
and it was not unexpected" to see human cases again because "we have
to remember the virus never disappeared." He said none of the 5
infections, including the death reported by Viet Nam's health
authorities, had been confirmed by WHO reference labs. The cases so
far were isolated, but he said that "if we start to see clusters, that
would be more of a concern."
Globally, the H5N1 virus has killed 191 people out of 313 known cases,
according to a tally by the WHO. Hundreds of millions of birds have
died or been slaughtered.
