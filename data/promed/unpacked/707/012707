Mexico and Central America retrospective. 24 May 2018. (published) An analysis of 61 Zika virus genomes revealed multiple independent ZIKV introductions to Central America and Mexico. One introduction, likely from Brazil via Honduras, led to most infections and the undetected spread of ZIKV through the region from late 2014. Multiple lines of evidence indicate biannual peaks of ZIKV transmission in the region, likely driven by varying local environmental conditions for mosquito vectors and herd immunity.

https://academic.oup.com/jid/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/infdis/jiy462/5060254?redirectedFrom=fulltext

[This study illustrates that the presence of detectable genomic fragments in semen, in one instance for over 180 days after the appearance of symptoms, does not necessarily imply that infectious virus is present. A review of published articles on duration of Zika virus in semen suggest that the infectious period for sexual transmission of ZIKV is shorter than estimates from the earliest post-outbreak studies, which were based on reverse transcription PCR alone.

Uganda:
- Case count. 5 Jul 2018. (published) 384 blood samples were collected. Of these, 5 were positive for ZIKV IgM 3 of which were confirmed by plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) to be ZIKV infections. This study provides the 1st evidence of laboratory-confirmed ZIKV infection in Uganda in 5 decades, and emphasizes the need to enhance sentinel surveillance.
http://jgv.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/jgv/10.1099/jgv.0.001113

[It seems unlikely that Zika virus disappeared from Uganda for 5 decades. Rather, studies similar to the above one probably have not been done. Given that some 80 percent of Zika infections are asymptomatic or very mild, and there are other etiological agents that cause febrile disease in Uganda, it is understandable the cases of Zika virus infection are missed or diagnosed as something else. Greg Folkers of NIAID is thanked for sending in this report. - Mod.TY]

- WHO advisory. 13 Jul 2018. (reported) The World Health Organization (WHO) has issued guidelines advising pregnant women against travelling to Uganda as a classified Zika-Infected country, with a potential of causing birth defects to unborn babies.

[However, last week, the Health minister, Dr Jane Ruth Aceng, dismissed as false and baseless the standing alert by WHO warning travellers of circulation of the Zika virus in Uganda. Ms Miriam Nanyunja, the disease prevention and control officer, said that researchers who carried out a study between 2014 and 2016 in partnership with the Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI) diagnosed 3 cases but are yet to establish whether the simple strain of virus which was discovered in Uganda in 1947 and the early 1950s is the same as that which causes microcephaly in the Americas.

[2] Infants, children and adolescents
Date: Tue 29 May 2018
Source: AMA Pediatr. Published online doi:10.1001/jamapediatrics.2018.0870 [edited]

Jennifer S. Read, MD, Brenda Torres-Velasquez, PhD, Olga Lorenzi, MS1; et al. Symptomatic Zika Virus Infection in Infants, Children, and Adolescents Living in Puerto Rico.

Key Points
Question: What are the clinical manifestations and viral loads of symptomatic infants, children, and adolescents infected with Zika virus?
Findings: In this cohort of 351 infants, children, and adolescents with Zika virus infection in Puerto Rico, most had fever, an often pruritic maculopapular rash, facial or neck erythema, and conjunctival hyperemia; presented for evaluation at fewer than 3 days after the onset of symptoms; and were discharged without hospitalization. Median viral loads obtained from the serum specimens differed significantly according to the number of days after the onset of symptoms.
Meaning: Symptomatic infants, children, and adolescents infected with Zika virus generally have a mild, often nonspecific illness not requiring hospitalization; and, although not significantly different according to age, sex, or disposition, Zika virus viral loads decreased with an increasing number of days since the onset of illness.

Abstract
Importance: Little information is available regarding Zika virus (ZIKV) infection in children.
Objective: To describe patients younger than 18 years who were infected with ZIKV and were enrolled in the Sentinel Enhanced Dengue and Acute Febrile Illness Surveillance System (SEDSS).

Design, Setting, and Participants: Children infected with ZIKV with 7 or fewer days of fever or emancipated minors aged 14 - 17 years with a generalized maculopapular rash, arthritis or arthralgia, or nonpurulent conjunctivitis were eligible for enrollment on or before 31 Dec 2016, in Puerto Rico. Patients were evaluated using ZIKV polymerase chain reaction testing at 7 or fewer days after the onset of symptoms. Available ZIKV polymerase chain reaction-positive specimens were evaluated to determine viral loads.

Exposures: Confirmed polymerase chain reaction-positive ZIKV infection.

Main Outcomes and Measures: Clinical characteristics and viral loads of symptomatic children with confirmed ZIKV infection.
Results: Of 7191 children enrolled in SEDSS on or before 31 Dec 2016, only those with confirmed ZIKV infection (351 participants) were included in this study. Participants who had confirmed ZIKV infection included 25 infants (7.1 percent), 69 children (19.7 percent) aged 1 to 4 years, 95 (27.1 percent) aged 5 to 9 years, and 162 (46.1 percent) aged 10 to 17 years. Among these, 260 patients (74.1 percent) presented for evaluation of ZIKV infection at fewer than 3 days after the onset of symptoms, 340 (96.9 percent) were discharged to home after evaluation, and 349 (99.4 percent) had fever, 280 (79.8 percent) had a rash, 243 (69.2 percent) had facial or neck erythema, 234 (66.7 percent) had fatigue, 223 (63.5 percent) had headache, 212 (60.4 percent) had chills, 206 (58.7 percent) had pruritus, and 204 (58.1 percent) had conjunctival hyperemia. Of 480 specimens collected (317 serum and 163 urine specimens) from 349 children, the median number of days after the onset of symptoms was lower for children who had serum specimens (1 day [interquartile range (IQR), 1-2 days]) than for children who had urine specimens (2 [1-3] days) (P < .001). Of 131 children who had both serum and urine specimens collected on the same day, the median viral load was higher in serum than in urine (median [IQR], 23 098 [8784-88 242] copies/mL for serum vs 9966 [2815-52 774] copies/mL for urine; P = .02). When a single serum sample from each of 317 patients was analyzed, there were no statistically significant differences in median viral loads according to age, sex, or disposition. However, the median serum viral load varied significantly according to the number of days after the onset of symptoms (0 days, 106 778 [IQR, 9772-1 571 718] copies/mL; 1 day, 46 299 [10 663-255 030] copies/mL; 2 days, 20 678 [8763-42 458] copies/mL; and ≥3 days, 15 901 [5135-49 248] copies/mL; P = .001).

Conclusions and Relevance: This study represents the largest study to date of ZIKV infection in the pediatric population. Most children infected with ZIKV had fever, rash, and conjunctival hyperemia. The children usually presented for evaluation at fewer than 3 days after the onset of symptoms. Viral loads for ZIKV were higher in serum vs urine specimens. Median viral loads in serum specimens differed significantly according to the number of days after the onset of symptoms.

[The above report provides a useful overview of the clinical picture and virus presence in the population of children studied. This study was not designed to quantify the proportion of Zika virus infected children who had inapparent or subclinical infections, to determine if they comprised the majority of infections as is the case with adults.

Taissa Ferreira Cardoso, Rosana Silva dos Santos, Raquel Miranda Correa, Juliana Vieira Campos, Ricardo de Bastos Silva, Christine Castinheiras Tobias,Arnaldo, Prata-Barbosa et al. Congenital Zika infection: neurology can occur without microcephaly.

[Introduction]
The fetal repercussions of Zika virus (ZIKV) infection during pregnancy is of interest for maternal and child health. Studies on the psychomotor and neurodevelopment of children exposed in utero to arboviruses, especially non-microcephalic children, are lacking. At a maternity university hospital in Brazil, we started following the development of children without microcephaly, born to mothers infected with ZIKV during pregnancy, searching for early warning signs of abnormalities.

[Conclusions]
These findings suggest that ZIKV infection in pregnancy can lead to neurodevelopmental abnormalities, even in children without microcephaly. One previous study of intrauterine ZIKV exposure has reported the development of children with normal head circumference at birth. The authors reported postnatal development of microcephaly in 11 of 13 infants and all had reduced brain volume on neuroimaging. The clinical findings were similar to ours, since all children had some degree of hypertonia, and some had dysphagia, irritability, a diagnosis of epilepsy, dystonia and spastic hemiparesis In congenital Zika syndrome, irritability is reported as one of the most frequent symptoms, and we found it present in about half of the patients. These findings, even in children without microcephaly, were compatible with those observed in children with cerebral palsy, and prognosis may be compromised. Therapeutic actions should begin early to reduce possible sequelae.

[This study provides additional evidence that children without microcephaly a t birth born to Zika virus infected mothers may develop significant postnatal abnormalities. Clinicians who have patients who had been infected with Zika virus while pregnant and gave birth to infants without microcephaly should monitor the development of those infants over time. Zika virus Readers interested in the details of the findings in the above study can find the report at the above URL.

An additional study supports effects of neonatal Zika virus infection that persist into adulthood. The results showed that neonatal ZIKV infection has long-term neuropathological and behavioral complications in mice and suggest that early inhibition of TNF-α-mediated neuroinflammation might be an effective therapeutic strategy to prevent the development of chronic neurological abnormalities. (http://stm.sciencemag.org/content/10/444/eaar2749).

Interestingly, a 2 Jul 2018 published study reported that 26 percent of nonhuman primates infected with Asian/American ZIKV in early gestation experienced fetal demise later in pregnancy despite showing few clinical signs of infection. Pregnancy loss due to asymptomatic ZIKV infection may therefore be a common but under-recognized adverse outcome related to maternal ZIKV infection (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0088-50).

Abstract
Since the 1st identification of neonatal microcephaly cases associated with congenital Zika virus infection in Brazil in 2015, a distinctive constellation of clinical features of congenital Zika syndrome has been described. Fetal brain disruption sequence is hypothesized to underlie the devastating effects of the virus on the central nervous system. However, little is known about the effects of congenital Zika virus infection on the peripheral nervous system. We describe a series of 4 cases of right unilateral diaphragmatic paralysis in infants with congenital Zika syndrome suggesting peripheral nervous system involvement and Zika virus as a unique congenital infectious cause of this finding. All the patients described also had arthrogryposis (including talipes equinovarus) and died from complications related to progressive respiratory failure.

Abstract
The outbreak of the Zika virus (ZIKV) has been associated with increased incidence of congenital malformations. Although recent efforts have focused on vaccine development, treatments for infected individuals are needed urgently. Sofosbuvir (SOF), an FDA-approved nucleotide analog inhibitor of the Hepatitis C (HCV) RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) was recently shown to be protective against ZIKV both in vitro and in vivo. Here, we show that SOF protected human neural progenitor cells (NPC) and 3D neurospheres from ZIKV infection-mediated cell death and importantly restored the antiviral immune response in NPCs. In vivo, SOF treatment post-infection (p.i.) decreased viral burden in an immunodeficient mouse model. Finally, we show for the 1st time that acute SOF treatment of pregnant dams p.i. was well-tolerated and prevented vertical transmission of the virus to the fetus. Taken together, our data confirmed SOF-mediated sparing of human neural cell types from ZIKV-mediated cell death in vitro and reduced viral burden in vivo in animal models of chronic infection and vertical transmission, strengthening the growing body of evidence for SOF anti-ZIKV activity.

[In these experiments, Sofosbuvir (SOF) looks promising indeed for blockage of Zika virus infection of the fetus. Assuming that SOF has no adverse effects on the developing human fetus and that the cost of administration is low enough to be affordable for women living under marginal conditions where Zika transmission is high, SOF could provide prophylactic protection avoid the risk of teratogenic effects with their serious adverse health, social and economic impacts. - Mod.TY]

Joao EC, Ferreira OdC Jr, Gouvea MI, Teixeira MdLB, Tanuri A, Higa LM, et al. Pregnant women co-infected with HIV and Zika: Outcomes and birth defects in infants according to maternal symptomatology.

Abstract

Background
In Brazil, the 1st reported case of ZIKV infection was in May 2015. Additionally, dengue (DENV) is endemic and there has been a recent outbreak of chikungunya (CHIKV). Since the clinical manifestations of different arboviral infections (AI) can be similar, definitive diagnosis requires laboratory testing.

Objectives
To determine the prevalence of ZIKV, DENV, and CHIKV infections in a Brazilian cohort of HIV-infected pregnant women, to assess clinical/immunological characteristics and pregnancy outcomes of women with evidence of recent AI.

Study design
Laboratory diagnosis of ZIKV, DENV and CHIKV infections utilized serological assays, RT-PCR and PRNT. The tests were performed at the 1st visit, 34-36 weeks of gestation and at any time if a woman had symptoms suggestive of AI. Mann-Whitney tests were used for comparison of medians, Chi-square or Fisher's to compare proportions; p< 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Poisson regression was used to analyze risk factors for central nervous system (CNS) malformations in the infant according to maternal symptomatology.

Results
Of 219 HIV-infected pregnant women enrolled, 92 percent were DENV IgG+; 47(22 percent) had laboratory evidence of recent AI. Of these, 34 (72 percent) were ZIKV+, 9 (19 percent) CHIKV+, and 2 (4 percent) DENV+. Symptoms consistent with AI were observed in 23 (10 percent) women, of whom 10 (43 percent) were ZIKV+, 8 (35 percent) CHIKV+. No CNS abnormalities were observed among infants of DENV+ or CHIKV+ women; 4 infants with CNS abnormalities were born to ZIKV+ women (3 symptomatic). Infants born to ZIKV+ women had a higher risk of CNS malformations if the mother was symptomatic (RR = 7.20), albeit not statistically significant (p = 0.066).

Conclusions
Among HIV-infected pregnant women with laboratory evidence of a recent AI, 72 percent were ZIKV-infected. In this cohort, CNS malformations occurred among infants born to both symptomatic and asymptomatic pregnant women with Zika infection.

[The authors point out in their discussion that despite the relatively large population of women enrolled in the study, there were relatively few infants born with CNS abnormalities, thus limiting their analyses of pregnancy outcomes according to arboviral infection and maternal symptomatology.

In another study of Zika virus infection in HIV infected patients, ZIKV-confirmed and suspected patients reported similar signs and symptoms. Pruritic rash was the most common symptom, followed by myalgia, nonpurulent conjunctivitis, arthralgia, prostration, and headache. In the short-term follow-up [median 67.5 days CD4 cell count and HIV viral load did not change significantly post ZIKV infection. There were no hospitalizations, complications, or deaths. In conclusion, among HIV-infected patients with suspected arboviral disease, 42.6 percent were ZIKV-infected. CD4 cell counts and HIV viral load were not different post ZIKV infection (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29912006). Greg Folkers is thanked for sending in this report. - Mod.TY]

Lucia Noronha, Camila Zanluca, Marion Burger, Andreia A Suzukawa, Marina Azevedo, Patricia Rebutini, et al. Zika Virus Infection At Different Pregnancy Stages: Anatomopathological Findings, Target Cells And Viral Persistence In Placental Tissues.
Abstract

Zika virus (ZIKV) infection in humans has been associated with congenital malformations and other neurological disorders, such as Guillain-Barre syndrome. The mechanism(s) of ZIKV intrauterine transmission, the cell types involved, the most vulnerable period of pregnancy for severe outcomes from infection and other physiopathological aspects remain unknown. In this study, we analyzed placental samples obtained at the time of delivery from a group of 24 women diagnosed with ZIKV infection during the 1st, 2nd or 3rd trimesters of pregnancy. Villous immaturity was the main histological finding in the placental tissues, although placentas without alterations were also frequently observed. Significant enhancement of the number of syncytial sprouts was observed in the placentas of women infected during the 3rd trimester, indicating the development of placental abnormalities after ZIKV infection. Hyperplasia of Hofbauer cells (HCs) was also observed in these 3rd-trimester placental tissues, and remarkably, HCs were the only ZIKV-positive fetal cells found in the placentas studied that persisted until birth, as revealed by immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis. Of women infected during pregnancy, 33 percent delivered infants with congenital abnormalities, although no pattern correlating the gestational stage at infection. Placental tissue analysis enabled us to confirm maternal ZIKV infection in cases where serum from the acute infection phase was not available, which reinforces the importance of this technique in identifying possible causal factors of birth defects. The results we observed in the samples from naturally infected pregnant women may contribute to the understanding of some aspects of the pathophysiology of ZIKV.

[Placental tissue analysis may be a useful and practical diagnostic tool, especially in cases of fetal abnormality. The occurrence of fetal abnormalities in 33 percent of the 24 women infected by Zika virus during pregnancy seems high, but might be a reflection of a small study population. - Mod.TY]

[8] Pooled testing of blood
Date: Fri 6 Jul 2018

https://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/FDAInBrief/ucm612702.htm?utm_campaign=07062018_FIB_FDA%20announces%20revised%20Zika%20testing%20guidance%20for%20blood%20donations&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Eloqua


Today [Fri 6 Jul 2018] the FDA announced the availability of a revised final guidance: "Revised Recommendations for Reducing the Risk of Zika Virus Transmission by Blood and Blood Components." This revised guidance replaces the August 2016 guidance, which recommended universal nucleic acid testing for Zika virus of individual units of blood donated in the U.S. states and territories. The revised guidance explains that, in order to comply with applicable testing regulations, blood establishments must continue to test all donated whole blood and blood components for Zika virus using a nucleic acid test. The revised guidance explains the basis for the FDA's determination that pooled testing of donations using a screening test licensed for such use by the FDA is a sufficient method for complying with these regulations and effectively reducing the risk of Zika Virus transmission, unless there is an increased risk of local mosquito-borne transmission of Zika virus in a specific geographic area that would trigger individual donation testing in that location. Alternatively, blood establishments may use an FDA-approved pathogen-reduction device for plasma and certain platelet products.

The change comes after careful consideration of all available scientific evidence, including consultation with other public health agencies, and following the recommendations of the December 2017 meeting of the Blood Products Advisory Committee. The agency is confident that today's recommendations will continue to ensure the safety of the U.S. blood supply by reducing the risk of transmission of Zika virus, while reducing the burden of testing for blood establishments.

Zika virus is transmitted primarily by the _Aedes_ mosquito, but it can also be spread by other routes, including by blood and sexual contact. Many people infected with the virus never develop symptoms, however when symptoms do occur they may include fever, arthralgia (joint pain), maculopapular rash (red area with small bumps), and conjunctivitis (red, irritated eyes). Zika virus can also be associated with Guillain-Barre syndrome and severe neurological complications. Zika virus infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects and is associated with other adverse pregnancy outcomes.

Qiang Ding, Jenna M. Gaska, Florian Douam, Lei Wei, David Kim, Metodi Balev, Brigitte Heller, and Alexander Ploss. Species-specific disruption of STING-dependent antiviral cellular defenses by the Zika virus NS2B3 protease.

Significance
To shed light on the host range of Zika virus (ZIKV), we surveyed the virus' ability to infect cells of evolutionarily diverse species. ZIKV replicates efficiently in human, great ape, Old and New World monkey, but not rodent cells. These observations correlated with ZIKV's ability to blunt the cGAS/STING signaling pathway in all primate cells tested but not in mice. We demonstrate that an enzyme shared by many flaviviruses (NS2B3) is responsible for functionally inactivating this antiviral defense. Our results highlight the importance of the cGAS/STING pathway in shaping the host range of ZIKV, which in turn may guide the development of murine models with inheritable susceptibility to ZIKV and other flaviviruses.

Abstract
The limited host tropism of numerous viruses causing disease in humans remains incompletely understood. One example is Zika virus (ZIKV), an RNA virus that has reemerged in recent years. Here, we demonstrate that ZIKV efficiently infects fibroblasts from humans, great apes, New and Old World monkeys, but not rodents. ZIKV infection in human--but not murine--cells impairs responses to agonists of the cGMP-AMP synthase/stimulator of IFN genes (cGAS/STING) signaling pathway, suggesting that viral mechanisms to evade antiviral defenses are less effective in rodent cells. Indeed, human, but not mouse, STING is subject to cleavage by proteases encoded by ZIKV, dengue virus, West Nile virus, and Japanese encephalitis virus, but not that of yellow fever virus. The protease cleavage site, located between positions 78/79 of human STING, is only partially conserved in nonhuman primates and rodents, rendering these orthologs resistant to degradation. Genetic disruption of STING increases the susceptibility of mouse--but not human--cells to ZIKV. Accordingly, expression of only mouse, not human, STING in murine STING knockout cells rescues the ZIKV suppression phenotype. STING-deficient mice, however, did not exhibit increased susceptibility, suggesting that other redundant antiviral pathways control ZIKV infection in vivo. Collectively, our data demonstrate that numerous RNA viruses evade cGAS/STING-dependent signaling and affirm the importance of this pathway in shaping the host range of ZIKV. Furthermore, our results explain--at least in part--the decreased permissivity of rodent cells to ZIKV, which could aid in the development of mice model with inheritable susceptibility to ZIKV and other flaviviruses.

[The question of species susceptibility arises when the possibility of Zika virus non-human animal reservoirs is considered. There is great vertebrate biodiversity of the tropical countries in which Zika virus has been found. How many of the vertebrate animals are susceptible to Zika virus infection is an open question when considering the natural history of this virus. The ability of Zika virus to evade cGAS/STING-dependent signaling may provide some clues about species susceptibility, and permit consideration of the wide variety of rodents, for example, and not just laboratory _Mus domesticus _ that might be of potential importance in maintenance of this virus in nature. - Mod.TY]

Patricia L. Schirmer, Aaron Wendelboe, Cynthia A. Lucero-Obusan, A. Ryono Mark A. Winters, Gina Oda, et al. Zika virus infection in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), 2015-2016

Abstract

Background
Zika virus (ZIKV) is an important flavivirus infection. Although ZIKV infection is rarely fatal, risk for severe disease in adults is not well described. Our objective was to describe the spectrum of illness in U.S. Veterans with ZIKV infection.

Methodology
Case series study including patients with laboratory-confirmed or presumed positive ZIKV infection in all Veterans Health Administration (VHA) medical centers. Adjusted odds ratios of clinical variables associated with hospitalization and neurologic complications was performed.

Principal findings
Of 1538 patients tested between January 2015-October 2016 and observed through March 2017, 736 (48 percent) were RT-PCR or confirmed IgM positive; 655 (89 percent) were male, and 683 (93 percent) from VA Caribbean Healthcare System (VACHCS). Of these, 94 (13 percent) were hospitalized, 91 (12 percent) in the VACHCS; 19 (3 percent) died after ZIKV infection. Hospitalization was associated with increased Charlson co-morbidity index (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.2; 95 percent confidence interval [CI], 1.1-1.3), underlying connective tissue disease (OR, 29.5; CI, 3.6-244.7), congestive heart failure (OR, 6; CI, 2-18.5), dementia (OR, 3.6; CI, 1.1-11.2), neurologic symptom presentation (OR, 3.9; CI, 1.7-9.2), leukocytosis (OR, 11.8; CI, 4.5-31), thrombocytopenia (OR, 7.8; CI, 3.3-18.6), acute kidney injury (OR, 28.9; CI, 5.8-145.1), or using glucocorticoids within 30 days of testing (OR, 13.3; CI 1.3-133). Patients presenting with rash were less likely to be hospitalized (OR, 0.29; CI, 0.13-0.66). Risk for neurologic complications increased with hospitalization (OR, 5.9; CI 2.9-12.2), cerebrovascular disease (OR 4.9; CI 1.7-14.4), and dementia (OR 2.8; CI 1.2-6.6).

Conclusion
Older Veterans with multiple comorbidities or presenting with neurologic symptoms were at increased risk for hospitalization and neurological complications after ZIKV infection.

Author summary
Zika virus (ZIKV) infection has become an important flavivirus infection that affected over a half of a million people in the Western Hemisphere by the end of 2016. Here we show risk factors for hospitalizations and neurologic complications in a US Veteran population. Over 700 Veterans with confirmed or presumed positive ZIKV were included. Our study showed that older Veterans with multiple comorbidities and those presenting with neurologic symptoms were more likely to be hospitalized, while if a patient presented with a rash they were less likely to be hospitalized. Neurologic complications were more likely in those hospitalized or those with a prior history of a cerebrovascular disease or dementia. Better understanding of those patients most at risk for severe disease can help providers when evaluating and treating patients with ZIKV infection.

[This report provides useful information for clinicians who attend elderly patients with Zika virus infections, especially those with comorbidities. Studies like the one above often depend in part on serological diagnosis of Zika virus infections. Differentiating Zika and Dengue virus infections serologically can be difficult because of antigenic cross-reactivity. A recent study found that urea wash in a Zika virus nonstructural protein 1 IgG ELISA distinguishes secondary dengue virus infection from Zika virus infection with previous dengue (sensitivity 87.5 percent, specificity 93.8 percent). This test will aid serodiagnosis, serosurveillance, and monitoring of Zika complications in dengue-endemic regions (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/24/7/17-1170_article).

Emilio Dirlikov, PhD1,2; Chelsea G. Major, MPH3,4; Nicole A. Medina, MPH3; et al. Clinical Features of Guillain-Barré Syndrome With vs Without Zika Virus Infection, Puerto Rico, 2016.

Abstract

Importance: The pathophysiologic mechanisms of Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) associated with Zika virus (ZIKV) infection may be indicated by differences in clinical features.

Objective: To identify specific clinical features of GBS associated with ZIKV infection.

Design, Setting, and Participants: During the ZIKV epidemic in Puerto Rico, prospective and retrospective strategies were used to identify patients with GBS who had neurologic illness onset in 2016 and were hospitalized at all 57 nonspecialized hospitals and 2 rehabilitation centers in Puerto Rico. Guillain-Barre syndrome diagnosis was confirmed via medical record review using the Brighton Collaboration criteria. Specimens (serum, urine, cerebrospinal fluid, and saliva) from patients with GBS were tested for evidence of ZIKV infection by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction; serum and cerebrospinal fluid were also tested by IgM enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In this analysis of public health surveillance data, a total of 123 confirmed GBS cases were identified, of which 107 had specimens submitted for testing; there were 71 patients with and 36 patients without evidence of ZIKV infection. Follow-up telephone interviews with patients were conducted 6 months after neurologic illness onset; 60 patients with and 27 patients without evidence of ZIKV infection participated.

Main Outcomes and Measures: Acute and long-term clinical characteristics of GBS associated with ZIKV infection.
Results: Of 123 patients with confirmed GBS, the median age was 54 years (age range, 4-88 years), and 68 patients (55.3 percent) were male. The following clinical features were more frequent among patients with GBS and evidence of ZIKV infection compared with patients with GBS without evidence of ZIKV infection: facial weakness (44 [62.0 percent] vs 10 [27.8 percent]; P < .001), dysphagia (38 [53.5 percent] vs 9 [25.0 percent]; P = .005), shortness of breath (33 [46.5 percent] vs 9 [25.0 percent]; P = .03), facial paresthesia (13 [18.3 percent] vs 1 [2.8 percent]; P = .03), elevated levels of protein in cerebrospinal fluid (49 [94.2 percent] vs 23 [71.9 prcent]; P = .008), admission to the intensive care unit (47 [66.2 percent] vs 16 [44.4 percent]; P = .03), and required mechanical ventilation (22 [31.0 percent] vs 4 [11.1 percent]; P = .02). Patients with GBS and evidence of ZIKV infection 6 months after neurologic illness onset more frequently reported having excessive or inadequate tearing (30 [53.6 percent] vs 6 [26.1 percent]; P = .03), difficulty drinking from a cup (10 [17.9 percent] vs 0; P = .03), and self-reported substantial pain (15 [27.3 percent] vs 1 [4.3 percent]; P = .03).

Conclusions and Relevance.
In this study, GBS associated with ZIKV infection was found to have higher morbidity during the acute phase and more frequent cranial neuropathy during acute neuropathy and 6 months afterward. Results indicate GBS pathophysiologic mechanisms that may be more common after ZIKV infection.

[12] Vertical transmission in _Aedes aegypti_

Costa CFd, Silva AVd, Nascimento VAd, Souza VCd, Monteiro DCdS, Terrazas WCM, et al. (2018) Evidence of vertical transmission of Zika virus in field-collected eggs of Aedes aegypti in the Brazilian Amazon.

Abstract

Background
Arboviruses are viruses transmitted to humans and other animals by the bite of hematophagous arthropods. Infections caused by chikungunya virus (CHIKV), dengue virus (DENV), Zika virus (ZIKV), and the deadlier yellow fever virus (YFV) are current public health problems in several countries, mainly those located in tropical and subtropical regions. One of the main prevention strategies continues to be vector control, with the elimination of breeding sites and surveillance of infested areas. The use of ovitraps for _Aedes_ mosquitos monitoring has already demonstrated promising results, and maybe be also useful for arboviral surveillance.

Methods
This work aimed to detect natural vertical transmission of arboviruses in _Aedes aegypti_ and _Aedes albopictus_. Mosquito egg collection was carried out using ovitraps in Itacoatiara, a mid-size city in Amazonas state, Brazil. Collected eggs were allowed to hatch and larvae were tested for CHIKV, DENV, and ZIKV RNA by RT-qPCR.

Results
A total of 2057 specimens (1793 _Ae. aegypti_ and 264 _Ae. albopictus_), in 154 larvae pools were processed. Results showed one positive pool for CHIKV and one positive pool for ZIKV. The active ZIKV infection was further confirmed by the detection of the negative-strand viral RNA and nucleotide sequencing which confirmed the Asian genotype. The Infection Rate per 1000 mosquitoes tested was assessed by Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) with 0.45 and 0.44 for CHIKV and ZIKV, respectively, and by Minimum Infection Rate (MIR) with 0.45 for both viruses.

Conclusion
To our knowledge, this is the 1st detection of ZIKV in natural vertical transmission in the _Ae. aegypti_, a fact that may contribute to ZIKV maintenance in nature during epidemics periods. Furthermore, our results highlight that the use of ovitraps and the molecular detection of arbovirus may contribute to health surveillance, directing the efforts to more efficient transmission blockade.

Author summary
The control of the vast majority of arbovirus infections relies on entomological measures to reduce mosquito infestation. Therefore, this study analyzed the use of ovitraps for arboviral surveillance in a mid-size city of the Amazonas state, Brazil. We found one larva pool infected with chikungunya virus, before the 1st human case confirmed in this municipality. Another pool was infected with Zika virus, demonstrating the 1st evidence that vertical transmission occurs in naturally infected _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito populations.

[The detection of transovarial transmission (TOT) is of epidemiological significance. Should TOT be efficient, the virus might be sustained in _Aedes aegypti_ populations without requiring human infectious blood meals and making control of the virus difficult. Further field and laboratory studies are needed.

Detection of Zika virus in mosquitoes has been laborious and costly. A recent published report stated that for the 1st time near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a rapid, reagent-free, and cost-effective tool that can be used to noninvasively detect ZIKV in heads and thoraces of intact Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes with prediction accuracies of 94.2 - 99.3 percent relative to quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). NIRS involves simply shining a beam of light on a mosquito to collect a diagnostic spectrum. It is estimated in this study that NIRS is 18 times faster and 110 times cheaper than RT-qPCR. It will be interesting to learn if this technique is technically uncomplicated enough to be established in tropical laboratories that need it most. https://outlook.office.com/owa/?realm=wisc.edu&path=/mail/inbox/rp.

[The incidence of Zika virus infections in the Americas this year (2018) is considerably reduced from the outbreak of 2016-2017. However, the virus is still present and vector populations are still abundant. It is important to continue aggressive surveillance of cases and implementation of the novel mosquito vector control measures that have recently been shown to be effective. Studies are needed to explore the role of wild animals, especially nonhuman primates, as possible reservoirs in the tropical countries in the Americas. - Mod.TY]
