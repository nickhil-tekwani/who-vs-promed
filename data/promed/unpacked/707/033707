Two neighbouring properties in the watercourse district west of Moree in northern [New South Wales] NSW have been recently diagnosed with anthrax. In both cases cattle were involved with mortalities of 19 (3 percent) and 18 (3 percent) on each. On the 2nd property a horse died as well, but it was not tested for anthrax. The immunochromatographic test (ICT) was used with positive results on both properties, and samples have subsequently been confirmed positive at the State Diagnostic Veterinary Laboratory, Menangle.

The properties are under quarantine, at risk animals have been vaccinated, and carcasses are to be burnt. There have been no further deaths on either property since 9 Mar 2013. No movements of animals have occurred off either property in recent months.

[This is the 1st set of bovine outbreaks in NSW since 2009 and thus of concern. Also it is far to the north of the previous bovine cases and well to the east of where sheep outbreaks have occurred. It is under active investigation so we can expect some clarification as to probable cause. With such numbers of cattle affected and a horse it is probable that spread is occurring thanks to haemophagic ('horse') flies. Our thanks to Barbara for this report.
