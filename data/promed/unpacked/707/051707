------------------------------------------------------------------
The following background on Barmah Forest disease [BFD] in Australia is abstracted from Gideon http://www.GideonOnline.com and the Gideon e-book series. [1,2]

Barmah Forest disease virus was 1st isolated from mosquitoes (_Culex annulirostris_) in the Barmah Forest, Northern Victoria in 1974. Human infection was subsequently reported along the south coast of New South Wales during the mid-1980's; in Queensland during 1988 -1989; in the Northern Territory in 1992, and in southwestern Western Australia in 1993. A new focus was described in Gippsland (Victoria) during 1993-1994. The number of localities reporting Barmah Forest disease increased during 1996-1998, and again during 1999-2001.

Disease incidence has increased somewhat since 2000, with most cases reported from Queensland and New South Wales. In the following chart, I have contrasted incidence data for Barmah Forest disease [BFD] with those of a similar illness, Ross River disease [3] http://cdn.gideononline.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/Barmah.bmp.

Seroprevalence surveys:
- 6.5 per cent of healthy adults in Queensland.
- 11.3 per cent of horses in Brisbane, 1.2 per cent of dogs, 10.7 per cent of bushtail possums (_Trichosaurus volpecula_) , 1.5 per cent of cats, 0 per cent of flying foxes [_Pteropus sp._] (1977-1999).

Vectors:
- The known vectors are _Ochlerotatus vigilax_, _Culex annulirostris_, _Aedes (Oc.) camptorhynchus_, _Ae. normanensis_, and _Coquillettidia spp._.
- _Aedes notoscriptus_ is considered an additional potential vector.
- BFD virus has also been recovered from _Aedes vigilax_ in eastern Australia (2005-2008). [Isolation of virus does not prove vector competence. - Mod.TY]

Wallabies and kangaroos serve as reservoirs for the virus; however, antibody is also present in cattle and horses.

Related viruses:
- Similar local illnesses have been ascribed to Trubanaman and Gan Gan viruses (Bunyaviridae); and Kokobera, Stratford and Edge Hill viruses (Flaviviridae).
- A single human case of Edge Hill virus infection has been described.
- A case of Kokobera fever was reported from Darwin in 1998.
- Kokobera virus has been isolated from _Culex annulirostris_ in the Northern Territory and northern Queensland.
- Kokobera virus was isolated from 18 of 25 351 _Cx. annulirostris_ tested in Cape York in 1998.

Notable outbreaks:
- 1992 to 1994 - An outbreak (22 cases) of Barmah Forest disease was reported in the south-west of Western Australia.
- 1995 - An outbreak (135 cases) was reported along the south coast of New South Wales.
- 2002 - An outbreak (47 cases) was reported in Victoria.
- 2002 to 2003 - An outbreak (297 cases) was reported in Queensland.
- 2005 to 2006 - An outbreak (1895 cases) was reported.

[ProMED thanks Dr. Berger for this interesting summary of Barmah virus occurrence and cases in Australia. Obviously, this virus is endemic in the country, and future outbreaks can be expected when there are periods of higher than usual rainfall that often bring an increase in mosquito populations, with corresponding increases in transmission of endemic arthropod-borne viruses in those areas.
