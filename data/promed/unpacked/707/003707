Sultanate of Oman: Equine Cases of West Nile Virus Infection
------------------------------------------------------------
Oman has issued an alert for West Nile fever following the discovery of
equine [cases] of [West Nile virus infection]. Government departments were
instructed to keep a close watch and doctors were advised to conduct
specific tests when investigating suspected cases of meningitis,
encephalitis, or any unknown fever, a report said.
The new measures follow a "limited outbreak" of West Nile fever in horses
in March 2003. The diagnosis was confirmed by the University of Pretoria in
South Africa, and a national diseases committee made up of officials from
the Health, Agriculture and Fisheries Ministries met to formulate a response.
Officials stressed that to date there have been no instances of infection
of humans in the Sultanate.
