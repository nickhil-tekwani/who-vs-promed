OIE launches the 2nd version of its World Animal Health Information System (WAHIS)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Six years after the launch of its World Animal Health Information System (WAHIS) and in line with its mission to extend transparency, efficiency, and speed with which animal health information is disseminated throughout the world, the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) announces the implementation of a new version of WAHIS.

The major change of this new version is the integration of a specific section for wildlife diseases notification into WAHIS.

"The same importance and thoroughness given to the surveillance and control of diseases in domestic animals must apply to wildlife, when relevant, as global movements and exchanges of pathogens within and between the 2 populations as well as towards men, are increasing," said OIE Director General, Dr Bernard Vallat.

The new section for wildlife disease notification in WAHIS allows Members to complement compulsory information on OIE-listed diseases of wild species but also to notify, on a voluntary basis, specific wildlife diseases that are not officially OIE-listed.

The new version of WAHIS proposes many other improvements including new options such as:

- The possibility to identify affected wild species by taxonomic family and Latin names;
- A new integrated database containing susceptible wild species by disease;
- Countries can select diseases present in their territories, provide monthly information on these diseases during an ongoing semester and finalize the rest of the requested data at the end of a given semester.

Two other new sections have been completely developed in the 2nd version of WAHIS. WAHIS Regional Core can be customized for a group of countries or a defined region so that they can provide more information on selected priority diseases of their choice. Countries can send information on a monthly basis or by outbreak occurrence.

OIE/NACA Regional Core is meant to collect monthly information, from the concerned countries from the Network of Aquaculture Centres in Asia and Pacific Region (NACA) and OIE Members, on OIE aquatic animal diseases as well as on other diseases of regional interest.

"With optimal electronic tools, the support of Delegates and capacity building of their national focal points nominated for animal disease notification, the OIE is better armed to provide to the international community the earliest warning on relevant disease events, and an improved knowledge of worldwide animal health situation," explained Dr Karim Ben Jebara Head of the OIE Animal Health Information Department.

[OIE deserves to be congratulated on the upgrade of WAHIS, in particular regarding infectious wildlife diseases, an issue steadily gaining importance concerning animal and human health.

WAHIS is an internet-based computer system that processes data on animal diseases in real time and then informs the international community. Access to this secure site is only available to authorised users, namely the delegates of OIE members and their authorised representatives, who use WAHIS to notify the OIE of relevant animal disease information.

The system has 2 components:
1. an early warning system to inform the international community, by means of "alert messages", of relevant epidemiological events that occurred in OIE Member Countries, and
2. a monitoring system of OIE-listed diseases (presence or absence) over time.

Transparency will be enhanced when the newly added WAHIS information is processed and becomes publicly available in OIE's WAHID Interface. WAHID replaced, since 2005, and significantly extended the former web interface named Handistatus II System. WAHID provides access to all data held within WAHIS.

The OIE, established in 1924, is an independent intergovernmental organisation responsible for improving animal health worldwide. It is recognised as a reference organisation by the World Trade Organization (WTO) and in 2011 had a total of 178 Member Countries. The OIE maintains permanent relations with 45 other international and regional organisations and has regional and sub-regional offices on every continent. OIE's headquarters are located in Paris.

ProMED-mail traditionally forwards to its subscribers selected WAHID notifications, in particular alert messages ("immediate notifications"). This will now, hopefully, be reinforced by the addition of notifications addressing infectious wildlife diseases and information on regionally selected priority diseases. - Mod.AS]
