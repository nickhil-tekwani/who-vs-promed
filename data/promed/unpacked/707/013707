Miguel Marquez, Governor of Guanajuato, confirmed that the number of birds to be slaughtered because of a possible infection with the avian influenza virus will increase, from 582 000 to 720 000.

Soon after the National Agro-Alimentary Health, Safety and Quality Service (SENASICA, according to its Spanish initials) confirmed the presence of the [avian influenza] virus in at least 7 farms from Bachoco Company, located in the Guanajuato municipalities of Dolores Hidalgo and San Luis de la Paz, the governor mentioned that the virus is already controlled and a sanitary barrier has been implemented in order to prevent the spread of the infection both within and outside the affected regions.

Mr Marquez urged the Federal Consumer Protection Agency to charge every individual found to be exaggeratedly rising the prices of eggs and poultry; he considered that the virus that is currently affecting Guanajuato farms may have migrated from Jalisco farms, where some cases of this infection were reported at the end of 2012.

It is also worth mentioning that last Friday [15 Feb 2013], Mr Enrique Martinez y Martinez, Secretary for Agriculture, ordered the delivery of 1 911 000 doses of the avian influenza vaccine to the representatives of Bachoco Company, so they may vaccinate breeding and commercial birds in the neighboring farms in order to establish a buffer zone for alleviating the damage and isolating the focus of infection.

He also issued directions for enhancing supervision activities in 13 points for verification and inspection (PVI, according to their Spanish initials) located in the whole state.

[The officials are clearly on the move to prevent spread and prevent a tragic occurrence of egg shortages as was experienced with the recent outbreak in Jalisco.
