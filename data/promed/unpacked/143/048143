During January and February 2019, we have advised in 3 outbreaks of EHV-1 infection (Equid Herpesvirus-1) with cases of myelopathy (EHM) in counties in Sweden, and also a case where Swedish horses were exposed to a case of EHM at a horse show in Norway.

Index case 1: 4 Jan 2019, Akersberga, in a boarding stable and riding school with 60 horses and ponies;
Index case 2: 11 Jan 2019, Asthammar, in a small premises;
Index case 3: 12 Feb 2019, Varmdo, in a boarding stable with around 50 horses.

Index cases 1 and 2 have a common denominator, but they have no connection to index case 3. The distance between outbreak 1 and 3 is 41 km [25.5 mi] by road and ferries, or 19 km [11.8 mi] by linear distance.

Outbreak 1 consisted of 37 out of 60 horses (62 percent) that developed pyrexia during 6 weeks between 4 Jan and 16 Feb 2019. Of these, 21 horses became neurologic (35 percent of all horses; 57 percent of the febrile horses). 19 horses were treated intensively in equine hospital; several were in the need of support by a sling, and several needed urinary catheterizations. Four horses (19 percent of EHM cases) were euthanized due to quadriplegia. This is the most severe outbreak of EHM that the country has experienced in the number of affected and lost horses.

One or both nasal swabs and EDTA blood were positive for EHV-1 qPCR in the acute clinical stage in all tested animals. Note, some were negative in one of the sampled materials. At least 2 of the asymptomatic horses were positive (shedders of virus) in the nose by qPCR analysis.

Some horses were treated with flunixin or heparin at the beginning of the febrile state.

Outbreak 2 consists of only 1 horse with EHM, and it has recovered uneventfully. EHV-1 diagnosis has been established via qPCR.

Outbreak 3 is still going on. Many horses have developed pyrexia, and 4 horses have displayed EHM so far. One horse was euthanized due to quadriplegia. EHV-1 diagnosis has been established via qPCR on nasal swab and/or blood on several occasions.

All facilities are under voluntary quarantine for 28 days after the last sick horse. EHV-1 with neurological signs or abortion is a notifiable disease in Sweden. However, only recommendations are given, no mandatory obligations.

The advice from veterinary authorities in the face of these outbreaks was to keep normal vigilance to infectious diseases, as there were no signs of spread from the quarantined stables. Several communications with advice on infection control were published, and there were regular meetings with equestrian organizations and the National Veterinary Institute.

The outbreaks caused greater concern in the horse industry than previously ever experienced, and a social media storm of fear spread over the country, causing most media to report on the news, and a great load of questions were posed to veterinary authorities. A 3-week voluntary stand-still of equestrian shows in the county of Stockholm was announced by the regional equestrian federation on 13 Feb 2019, and some other arranging parties outside the county also decided to postpone horse shows. Many riding schools and private stables closed for new or visiting horses, even in areas quite remote from Stockholm and Uppsala.

The interest in EHV-1 was then further boosted when a Norwegian horse developed neurological signs at the international horse show in Lillestrom, Norway on 25 Feb 2019, later diagnosed with EHV-1. Everyone involved with the show were advised to keep their horses quarantined at home. Among these were about 20 Swedish horses that are now voluntarily quarantined.

[Dr Grondahl is gratefully acknowledged for this detailed firsthand information on virulent EHV-1 infection (Equid Herpesvirus-1) outbreaks in Sweden and Norway. These seem to parallel similar recent events in Bavaria (Germany). It may be assumed that coordinated efforts to try to trace the source(s) of the infections in the 3 countries are/have been undertaken.

According to OIE's terrestrial animal-health code, this listed (and thus notifiable) disease of horses is currently named "Infection with equid herpesvirus-1 (Equine rhinopneumonitis)." OIE's Manual explains that Equine rhinopneumonitis (ER) is a collective term for any one of several contagious, clinical disease entities of equids that may occur as a result of infection by either of 2 closely related herpesviruses, equid herpesvirus-1 and -4 (EHV-1 and EHV-4). Only infection with EHV-1 is listed by the OIE.

Primary infection by either EHV-1 or EHV-4 is characterised by upper respiratory tract disease of varying severity that is related to the age and immunological status of the infected animal. EHV-1 also causes the more serious complications of abortion waves, perinatal foal death, or paralytic neurological disease (equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy). Like other herpesviruses, EHV-1 and 4 induce long-lasting latent infections and can be reactivated following stress or pregnancy. Most horses are likely to be re-infected multiple times during their lifetime, often mildly or subclinically.

Detection of viral DNA or anti-EHV antibodies should, therefore, be interpreted with care.

The above and exhaustive additional information on the disease, its diagnosis, and vaccines is available in chapter 2.5.9. of OIE's Manual of terrestrial animal diseases, at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/fr/Health_standards/tahm/2.05.09_EQUINE_RHINO.pdf (Version adopted in May 2017).

Both live attenuated and inactivated viral vaccines are available. - Mod.AS
