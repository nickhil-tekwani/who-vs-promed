Ebola hemorrhagic fever in Gabon/Republic of Congo - WHO update 8
----------------------------------------------------------------------
As of Sun 23 Dec 2001, 27 confirmed cases (12 laboratory and 15
epidemiologically linked), including 18 deaths, have been reported. An
additional 7 suspected cases are under investigation in Gabon. All contacts
(having direct or suspected contact with the blood or other body fluids of
a case) are being closely monitored for signs or symptoms of Ebola
hemorrhagic fever for 21 days. Currently, 203 contacts are under active
follow up. We anticipate one or more cases may develop among these contacts.
Of the 27 cases, 15 were detected in Gabon and 12 in the neighboring
villages of the Republic of the Congo (a map of the area can be accessed at
the above URL)). As of Sun 23 Dec 2001, 109 contacts are being followed up
in Gabon and 94 in the Republic of the Congo. The international team is
operational on both sides of the border and is working closely in the field
with the teams from the Congolese and Gabonese Ministries of Health on
outbreak control interventions.
