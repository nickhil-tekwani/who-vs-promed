Mosquitoes recently found in La Quinta tested positive for Saint Louis encephalitis (SLE) [virus], the 1st such detection of the virus in the city, vector control officials said.

The samples were collected from a mosquito trap near the corner of Madison Street and Avenue 52, according to the Coachella Valley Mosquito and Vector Control District.

The latest detection brings the total number of SLE-positive mosquito samples in the Coachella Valley to 91 this year [2016], the highest number of SLE- infected mosquito pools on record in the region, said CVMVCD's Jill Oviatt. There were 37 SLE-positive samples detected at this time last year [2015].

District officials said that despite the statistics: "We are definitely seeing a drop in virus activity across the valley as temperatures cool," said Oviatt. "But this latest detection makes it clear that infected mosquitoes are still out there, and people need to remain vigilant to avoid getting bitten by wearing insect repellent and covering up when mosquitoes are active."

Saint Louis encephalitis is transmitted to animals and humans through the bite of an infected mosquito, but most people infected with the virus will not experience any illness, according to CVMVCD.

Those who have symptoms may experience tiredness, fever, nausea, headaches and body aches.

Hospitalization, long-term disability and death can result in rare cases. The elderly, young children, and those with weakened immune systems are at the greatest risk of experiencing severe symptoms when infected.

The virus has been found in 176 mosquito samples across 8 California counties this year [2016]. One human case has been reported to date.

[SLE virus is endemic in southern California. There has been active transmission of SLE virus this year (2016) in southern California, Arizona and Nevada. However, over several years, SLE virus has declined in Southern California counties, although virus has reemerged in several localities in California and across the southwestern USA in the past 2 years.
