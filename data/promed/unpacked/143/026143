Ontario: Viral Gastroenteritis Outbreaks in Healthcare Facilities
--------------------------------------------------
More than 200 Londoners are sick with the suspected Norwalk virus
infection that has closed hospital and long-term care facilities
across the province. Most of the ill are residents and staff at
Dearness Home, although there are suspect cases at Parkwood Hospital
and a local child-care centre. "We don't know yet if any of these
cases are caused by Norwalk virus," said Dr. Bryna Warshawsky,
assistant medical officer of health. "But it spreads quickly and we
want people who are vomiting or have diarrhea to take precautions so
it doesn't spread."
At Dearness, an estimated 150 residents and 50 staff have become ill.
Visitors are being advised to take precautions, such as hand washing,
and to confine their visits and not wander through other areas of the
facility. Some programs and outings were cancelled to avoid spreading
the virus. "It's on the wane," said nurse Jane Yates when contacted
last night. "Things are getting back to normal."
In a news release yesterday, Dr. Colin D'Cunha, Ontario's chief
medical officer of health, urged Ontarians to take precautions to
avoid contracting the virus. Hospitals in Toronto, Brampton,
Kitchener and Brantford -- as well as some in Alberta, Quebec and New
Brunswick -- have been forced to restrict access because of the virus.
Warshawsky said proper hygiene will reduce the risk of contracting
and spreading the virus. The virus is spread through poor
hand-washing (particularly after using the washroom), the sharing of
food and utensils with an infected person, or coming into contact
with an infected surface such as door handles. The best way to
prevent the spread is by washing hands thoroughly after each trip to
the washroom. Objects such as taps, door handles, banisters, toilets,
and bath rails should be cleaned frequently. If you have the virus,
Warshawsky said, it's important to drink plenty of fluids to avoid
dehydration and to wash hands properly to not infect others. Milk
products should be avoided. Those with symptoms should stay away from
hospitals, day-care centres, schools, and group settings until
symptom-free.
