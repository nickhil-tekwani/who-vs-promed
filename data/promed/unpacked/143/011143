Leishmaniasis increases 6-fold in southern Sudan
------------------------------------------------
The number of cases of a potentially fatal parasitic disease
[leishmaniasis] has increased 6-fold in southern Sudan. Visceral
leishmaniasis -- also known as kala-azar -- is the most severe form
of the disease. More than 6000 people have been infected and more
than 300 have died in the last year.

The World Health Organization and the Sudanese ministry of health are
leading the distribution of treatments and testing equipment to affected areas.

Visceral leishmaniasis is caused by the Leishmania parasite and
transmitted via the bite of an infected sand fly. It is the most
dangerous form of the disease because the parasite migrates into the
spleen and liver. It causes high fever, significant weight loss,
enlargement of the spleen and liver, and anaemia. If left untreated
visceral leishmaniasis is nearly always fatal.

The number of cases from September 2009 until now is more than 6
times higher than in 2007-08. The counties of Old Fangak and Ayod in
the south of the country are particularly affected.

"Before the situation becomes uncontrollable, we must do something
about it," Dr Abdi Aden WHO Dr Abdi Aden, head of the WHO's office
for Southern Sudan said. "The increased number of cases in Old
Fangak, Ayod and surrounding areas is very disturbing and it is
becoming difficult to contain the outbreak."

To keep responding to the outbreak over the next 6 months an
additional USD 700 000 is needed. This will buy more treatments,
diagnostic kits as well as food supplies.

Kala-azar suppresses the immune system making patients vulnerable to
other infections like pneumonia and malaria. Those that are
malnourished are at particularly high risk of dying. The disease is
difficult to treat -- daily injections for a month are needed, so
patients need to stay close to health facilities. But many patients
still cannot reach treatment centres due to insecurity, flooding and distance.

Dr Mounir Christo Lado of the Sudanese ministry of health said the
kala-azar outbreak could worsen between now and next spring.
"Insecurity, flooding and the lack of health facilities across a vast
geographical area are all playing a part in limiting access to
treatment for this deadly disease," he said.

[Leishmaniasis is endemic in southern Sudan. A recent review has just
been published: Postigo JA. Leishmaniasis in the World Health
Organization Eastern Mediterranean Region. Int J Antimicrob Agents.
2010 Aug 19. [Epub ahead of print].

In southern Sudan transmission of _Leishmania donovani_ from human to
human is probably the most important route of infection. Thus a
breakdown of vector control and lack of treatment facilities and
resources could be one explanation for the surge in cases.
Leishmaniasis is an HIV-associated infection and the surge could also
be HIV-related. The previously reported outbreak in Jonglei State is
probably part of the increase in cases in this report. - Mod.EP]
