Rabies epidemics in Mexico State, 91 cases in Cuautitlan and Ecatepec
-----------------------------------------------
Dozens of dogs infected with rabies were detected this year [2005] in the
valley between Cuautitlan and Ecatepec in Mexico state. According to health
authorities, the number of infected dogs is near 100.
"We now have 91 cases that have been reported as positive by the rabies
laboratory," the State Health Secretary, Ms. Maria Elena Barrera-Tapia,
confirmed.
Ecatepec is the municipality with the highest number of infected dogs,
according to official data. "We have 47 cases detected in Ecatepec
municipality," the city council secretary, Mr. Jose Luis Flores, said.
Authorities are concerned that the epidemic threat may reach Guadalupe
highlands, where a case has already been detected. "There are packs of dogs
there living in the highlands without any control," said Ms. Barrera-Tapia.
In Guadalupe highlands, an area belonging to Coacalco municipality, a fence
designed for trapping wild dogs was placed, but until now, only 8 animals
had been captured.
In addition to the proliferation of street dogs, another problem accounting
for rabies spread is that fraudulent health personnel are administering
vaccines, injecting substances different from rabies vaccine, while owners
think that their pets are vaccinated; so it is important to detect these
fraudulent health personnel.
"These persons are easy to identify, since they come to the households and
offer their vaccination services, but they also offer [parasite treatment]
for animals and other vaccines, and they charge for their services.
Immunization services run by the Health Secretary are free of charge," said
Oscar Velasquez-Monroy, from the Epidemiological Surveillance area.
From tomorrow, the State Health Secretary will initiate an emergency plan
for preventing more rabies cases. "We are starting a new vaccination
campaign in Mexico State from 6 Dec 2005, and we expect to complete
vaccination in 100 000 households," added Mr. Velasquez-Monroy.
If animals are vaccinated, protection is not only for them, but also for
our own families.

[With this many rabies cases in dogs, it is likely there will soon be human
cases. Animals that are owned need to be correctly vaccinated with a
vaccine from the Health Secretary. Veterinarians, in conjunction with the
Health Secretary, may want to consider setting up vaccine stations in a
municipality and doing as many of the dogs in that municipality as possible
on several given days. - Mod.TG]
