Maine officials say a horse in York County has tested positive for the mosquito-borne West Nile virus. The Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry says it's the state's 1st confirmed case of the disease in a horse on record.

The virus is spread by the bite of an infected mosquito. The horse was not vaccinated against the disease. The animal was showing neurological signs last week. The department said it is undergoing supportive veterinary care and is not a threat to infect other animals or people.

[West Nile virus infecting a horse in Maine has not been observed before. It would not be a stretch to suggest that this is a result of climate change.

There is a very effective vaccine available to protect your animal. It is so much easier and cheaper to prevent the disease than to treat it and hope your animal survives. Many animals do not survive this disease or are euthanized for humane reasons. Even with treatment, the animal may not be able to overcome the disease and then must be euthanized. Why do that? Why not vaccinate and save yourself the heartache and expense of treatment and watching your animal suffer? Just vaccinate your animals and follow the directions to protect them against mosquitoes. Get rid of mosquito breeding areas and start protecting your equine friend. - Mod.TG/MHJ

The article makes no mention of the horse's travel history. If there is no recent travel, it would indeed seem suggestive of a locally acquired infection. As noted in the following link, WNV was first identified in Maine in birds in 2001 (https://www.maine.gov/dhhs/mecdc/infectious-disease/epi/vector-borne/west-nile/). - Mod.JH
