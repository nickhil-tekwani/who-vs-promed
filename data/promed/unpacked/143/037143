Poliomyelitis in Indonesia - update 10-8 Jul 2005
--------------------------
22 new polio cases were confirmed in Indonesia, bringing the total number
of cases to 122. The new cases are from West Java province.
Recently confirmed cases in Sumatra and Central Java occurred outside the
area where 2 emergency vaccination campaigns were held on 31 May and 29 Jun
[2005]. A large outbreak response immunization targeting 78 000 children
aged less than 5 years was held from 26 Jun [2005] around the case in
Central Java. Sumatra and Central Java will be included in the next phase
of the large-scale immunization campaigns, which will start from August [2005].

[The case count in this current outbreak continues to grow. The above
update mentions that these newly confirmed cases were all from West Java
province. More information on the epidemiology of this ongoing outbreak
(epidemiologic curve by date of onset and province of residence,
information on the vaccination histories of the cases) would be of use in
assessing the efficacy of the ongoing control measures as well as the
overall epidemic situation (are we still on the "upslope" or are we now on
the "downslope" of the epidemic curve?). In the absence of information on
the number of suspected cases currently under investigation, one is
hard-pressed to make any predictions; if there are many suspected cases
with dates of onset preceding the current vaccination campaigns pending
laboratory results, we would not be surprised by these frequent updates
with additional confirmed cases. - Mod.MPP]
