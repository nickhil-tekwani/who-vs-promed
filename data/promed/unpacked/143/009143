The crops that bring us most of our food provide for 35 per cent of calorie intake, as well as most minerals, vitamins, and antioxidants. Nuts, melons, and berries will not grow without pollinating insects. Bees also pollinate citrus fruits, apples, onions, broccoli cabbage, zucchini, beans, peppers, eggplants, cucumbers, tomatoes, beans, coffee, cocoa, avocados, and coconuts. The production of these crops belongs to most valuable segments of the global food industry. Thus, the disappearance of bees from our planet will at first trigger a major food crisis that humanity has never seen before.

Scientists started registering the process of the mass extinction of bees all over the world in 2006. In the USA, up to 30 per cent of bee colonies die every winter. Over the past 50 years, the production of bee-dependent agricultural products has quadrupled, but the number of bee colonies has halved. The quantity of bees per hectare has decreased by 90 per cent.

The phenomenon became known as colony collapse disorder or "bee flu". Europe loses 20 per cent of its bee colonies every year, and one can observe a similar trend in the USA and Asia. As for Russia, the Russian Ministry for Agriculture has reported that bees have died out massively in several regions of the country.

Representatives of the Ministry for Agriculture of the Russian Federation said that due to the high bee mortality in a number of regions of the country, the beekeeping industry has suffered a significant material damage. The scale of the disaster is still difficult to assess. The cause of the death of insects remains unclear too.

Over the past 10 years, the number of bee colonies in Russia has decreased by almost 20 per cent. The problem is not about financial losses that beekeepers incur -- the problem is about the possible food crisis that may strike the whole world.

In the summer of 2019 in Russia, mass bee mortality was recorded in the Tatarstan republic, in the republic of Bashkortostan, in Bryansk, Voronezh, Lipetsk, Kursk, Ulyanovsk, Moscow, Tula, Nizhny Novgorod, Ryazan, Rostov, Saratov, Smolensk regions, in Mordovia, Udmurtia, Mari El, Krasnodar, Altai, Stavropol, and other regions.

Specialists have started looking into the problem, but the research will take months. However, scientists already say that bees die on a massive scale because of the use of pesticides and herbicides on agricultural fields. To make matters worse, authorities do not inform beekeepers about the time, place and peculiarities of the chemical treatment of crops.

Over the recent years, scientists have recorded a rapid decline in the number of domestic and wild bees, as well as many other insects, including butterflies, on all inhabited continents. Over the past 5-10 years, the population of wild bees has decreased by 25-30 per cent, whereas the quantity of domestic bees in the United States halved in 2015.

It is worthy of note that the population of monarch butterflies and cabbage butterflies in the United States has mysteriously declined by about 1/3 during the last 25 years. In addition to humans and global warming, the population of bees and butterflies decreases because of new viral infections and parasites, such as Varroa mites, as well as herbicides and pesticides that change the behaviour of insects or their development program. The quantity of 75 per cent of lepidopteran insect species [moths and butterflies] living in the north of the United States has been declining for 25 years. Over the past 40 years, their population has dropped by 45 per cent, which is higher than in Europe and other parts of the world.

A report from the United Nations said that bees disappear 8 times faster than mammals, birds, and reptiles. Agriculture, mining, and manufacturing industries make our life comfortable, but these industries require deforestation and swamp drainage. These activities destroy natural ecosystems, pollute the atmosphere, the world's oceans and contribute to global warming.

Germany, France, and Italy already banned certain types of pesticides. In the UK, they revise rules for the use of pesticides after it was found that they can impair the memory and immunity of the bee. At the same time, mankind can no longer exist without fertilisers. The population of the Earth grows by 70 million people every year. To crown it all, the USA, Argentina, and the EU use a significant amount of their grain harvests for the production of biofuels for eco-friendly cars.

Some experts blame cellular communication systems. It was established that the population of bees decreases noticeably in places where cell towers are installed. However, bees avoid any other type of hostile energy, whether it goes about cell towers, power lines, or any other radiation.

[Mounting evidence indicates that bee colony collapses are caused by interacting stress factors that affect the balance between pathogens and host immunity. It has been shown that otherwise silent infections with deformed wing virus become uncontrollable and kill the bees when accompanied by infection with the mite _Varroa destructor_. Other studies implicated pesticides interacting with cold (other stressors). It is likely that many factors, mostly anthropogenic stressors, interacting in synergy disrupt the health of bees and make them less capable of resisting infections. This complex phenomenon requires integrative and interdisciplinary responses. - Mod.PMB
