Notes from the Field: Heartland Virus Disease -- United States, 2012-2013. Daniel M. Pastula, MD, George Turabelidze, MD, Karen F. Yates, MS, Timothy F. Jones, MD, Amy J. Lambert, PhD, Amanda J. Panella, MPH, Olga I. Kosoy, MA, Jason O. Velez, Marc Fischer, MD, J. Erin Staples, MD.
-----------------------------------------------
Summary:
Heartland virus is a newly identified phlebovirus that was 1st isolated from 2 northwestern Missouri farmers hospitalized with fever, leukopenia [low white blood cell count], and thrombocytopenia [low platelet count] in 2009 (1). Based on the patients' clinical findings and their reported exposures, the virus was suspected to be transmitted by ticks. After this discovery, CDC worked with state and local partners to define the ecology and modes of transmission of Heartland virus, develop diagnostic assays, and identify additional cases to describe the epidemiology and clinical disease. From this work, it was learned that Heartland virus is found in the Lone Star tick (_Amblyomma americanum) _ [see the URL for an image of this tick]. Six additional cases of Heartland virus disease were identified during 2012-2013; 4 of those patients were hospitalized, including one with comorbidities who died.

Report:
A confirmed case of Heartland virus disease was defined as a clinically compatible illness in a person with laboratory evidence of recent Heartland virus infection. A clinically compatible illness was defined as fever (100.4 F or higher [38.0 C or higher]), leukopenia (white blood cell count under 4500 cells/mm3; normal range = 4500-12 000 cells/mm3), and thrombocytopenia (platelet count under 150 000/mm3; normal range = 150 000-400 000/mm3) without a more likely clinical explanation. Evidence of recent Heartland virus infection included
1) detection of viral RNA by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction on blood or tissue or
2) a 4-fold or greater rise in virus-specific plaque reduction neutralization antibody titers between acute and convalescent serum specimens.

During 2012-2013, 6 confirmed Heartland virus disease cases were identified; 5 patients were Missouri residents, and one was a Tennessee resident. All patients were men aged 50 years or older (median = 58 years; range = 50-80 years). Patients had symptom onset during May-September (3 cases in May, one in July, and 2 in September [2012 or 2013?]). All of the patients had fever, thrombocytopenia, and leukopenia when 1st evaluated. Of the 5 patients whose acute symptoms were systematically recorded, all reported fatigue and anorexia, and 4 reported headache, nausea, myalgia, or arthralgia; 4 of the patients were hospitalized. One patient with multiple comorbidities died. All of the patients reported spending several hours per day outside (e.g. working, walking, doing yard [garden] work, hunting, or hiking), and 5 of the 6 patients reported tick bites in the 14 days preceding their illness onset.

No vaccine or medication is available to prevent or treat Heartland virus disease. Because the virus likely is transmitted through infected ticks or other arthropods, prevention depends on using insect repellents, wearing long sleeves and pants, avoiding bushy and wooded areas, and performing [whole body] checks for ticks after spending time outdoors. Health-care providers should consider Heartland virus testing in patients who develop fever, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia without a more likely explanation and who have tested negative for Ehrlichia and Anaplasma infection or have not responded to doxycycline therapy (3).

[Although this disease is relatively rare, one hopes that clinicians seeing the symptoms described above, particularly if there is a history of tick bites, will include Heartland virus infections in the list of pathogens to rule out. Studies to determine vertebrate hosts and arthropods responsible for maintenance are needed. A study published last year (2013) reported prevalence of antibodies to Heartland virus or one related to it in domestic and wild mammals in Minnesota. The reference follows:

Murtaugh. Novel Bunyavirus in Domestic and Captive Farmed Animals, Minnesota, USA. Emerg Infect Dis. 2013;19(9):1487-489.

Abstract
----------
We tested blood samples from domestic and captive farmed animals in Minnesota, USA, to determine exposure to severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus and Heartland-like virus. We found antibodies against virus nucleoproteins in 10-18 percent of samples from cattle, sheep, goats, deer, and elk in 24 Minnesota counties.

Conclusions
----------
Our data show that both domestic and captive farmed animals in Minnesota were exposed to SFTSV- or HLV-like virus, as evidenced by the presence of antibodies reactive against the NP [nucleoprotein] of SFTSV [severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus, a virus recently described as causing human and domestic animal disease in Asia. - Mod.TY] at a prevalence ranging from 10 per cent to 18 per cent. Because SFTSV and HLV are closely related, the viruses detected in this region are most likely HLV or close relatives of HLV. Although NPs of SFTSV and HLV are antigenically cross-reactive, the observed detection rates may be underestimated because the reagents were developed and optimized for SFTSV NP antibodies. A more specific serologic test targeting HLV-specific antigens is under development; it is expected to more accurately assess the prevalence of HLV- or HLV-like virus among animals and humans.

One hopes that further studies will definitively determine whether Heartland virus is present in Minnesota and other localities in the mid-western USA, and infecting domestic and wild mammals.
