----------------------------------------------------------------------
The zoonotic outbreak of visceral leishmaniasis [VL] is in the city
of Corrientes (capital of Corrientes [province], in the northeastern
part of our country) not in Cordoba city!

We had the emergence of VL since 2006 (first in Misiones [province],
Posadas city). "La Olla" in this case is a neighborhood of Corrientes
city (inside the city).

[ProMED-mail apologizes for the wrong location (Cordoba). We received
several e-mails pointing this out and chose to post the 1st reply to
the posting from Dr Thomas Orduna. We hope the confusion has now been
corrected . - Mod.EP]
