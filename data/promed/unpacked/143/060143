The death toll from this year's dengue fever outbreak in various parts of
Indonesia has risen to at least 422 with more than 16,000 others infected,
officials said.
Officials at the Health Ministry said Thursday the fatalities recorded
since January came from 11 of Indonesia's 27 provinces. The central
government has labeled the dengue outbreak "extraordinary" and called for a
nationwide mosquito eradication [elimination program.
The number of death recorded is believed to be only a fraction of the
actual number of fatalities throughout the country, officials said, citing
the reason that only four provinces had filed casualties to the ministry
this month.
Jakarta, capital of Indonesia, is the hardest hit and the epidemic has
triggered a blood transfusion crisis with scores of patients' relatives
reportedly forced to spend more than a day waiting in the understaffed
Jakarta chapter of the Indonesia Red Cross (PMI).
Local newspapers reported Friday that at least 5,400 people in Jakarta with
the disease had been hospitalized in the past four months and 54 people had
died.
The death toll is expected to rise, as government-run hospitals and blood
donor agencies in Jakarta do not have a sufficient supply of blood badly
needed by the dengue patients, said the reports.
Dengue fever, an acute, cholera like disease [I left this in for laughs.

235 lives in Indonesia last year and infected 13,047 people, officials
said. The tropical disease, transmitted by mosquitoes, [causes fever,
