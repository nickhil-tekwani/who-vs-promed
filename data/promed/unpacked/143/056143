I can provide anecdotal (and partial) information only. While discussing
this problem with veterinary students during a Public Health Course at [the
University of Pennsylvania (USA) , one of the students volunteered that
her father (a surgeon) had had to excise the granuloma arising from human
mycobacteriosis on only two occasions in twenty years.

Mycobacteriosis in fish is generally caused by _Mycobacterium_ species that
occur in the environment. Aquarists have been known to develop a
granulomatous skin infection from continuous exposure to infected tanks,
but this is uncommon. As an example, I have had a tank of goldfish
infected with _Mycobacterium chelonei_ for over five years and do not take
special precautions when working with the tank, but have not suffered an
infection (yet). Persons who are immunosuppressed should obviously avoid
direct contact with aquaria. Open wounds are likely to increase the risk
of infection, both with _Mycobacterium_ spp and other bacteria. There have
been several reports of fatal wound infections with marine bacteria (a
reference to one is given below). However, the risk to the average person
with normal immune function from touching an aquarium exhibit is likely to
be far less than from eating a seafood platter.

_Photobacterium (Vibrio) damsela_. Clinical Infectious Diseases, October
1997, 25, p935-936.

I suspect that controlled human trials of handling contaminated marine life
have not been done; however, a number of potentially pathogenic
non-tuberculous mycobacteria have been found in water and marine life.
Three that come to mind are _Mycobacterium xenopi_ ("frog"), _M. chelonae_
("turtle") and _M. marinum_. The latter causes skin and soft tissue
infection following traumatic inoculation from aquaria and swimming pools
(swimming pool granuloma).

...or the corollary; what might the petters be imparting to the pet-ee's?

We have surveyed the sediments of a number of exhibits at a public aquarium
and found that we recovered Mycobacterium sp. in >40% of the samples. The
positive samples occurred in both fresh and salt water exhibits as well as
in ambient, heated and refrigerated exhibits. Marine mammal filtration
system sediments were consistently negative.
I think the presence of these organisms represents more of a risk to
aquarium personnel, who may have considerable contact with sediments, than
to members of the general public who presumably are simply getting their
hands wet. The risk to immunocompromised individuals of either group would
likely be greater. Many millions of individuals have handled animals from
interactive aquatic exhibits without any observed ill effects though the
lengthy incubation period of many mycobacterial species might make it
difficult to demonstrate a simple exposure/infection effect.
I am unaware of whether similar surveys of natural beaches, tide pools,
etc. have been conducted. It may well be that these are more ubiquitous
organisms than we have previously considered them to be.
