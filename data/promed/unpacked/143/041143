Dr E Willoughby stated that a 3-year-old boy infected with rabies was the 1st patient to survive and recover in Dominican Republic and number 17 in the world [without receiving the rabies vaccine].

Dr Willoughby explained that rabies is almost 100 percent fatal, and kills approximately 60 000 people per year. The expert, who works from the Children's Hospital of Wisconsin, participated in the implementation of the Milwaukee protocol through daily video-conferences.

Last week [1-7 Nov 2017], the CDC representative in Dominican Republic, Nelson Arboleda, visited the pediatric hospital Arturo Grullón to conduct a follow up of the patient's evolution. The child, from Altamira, Puerto Plata, was hospitalized on 28 Sept 2017, after having been bitten by a dog with signs of rabies.

The diagnosis was made by the Dr Defilló National Laboratory, and confirmed by the CDC in Atlanta.

For the treatment of this patient an interdisciplinary team was created, led by Dr Soraya Castro Llibre, including professionals of the Pediatric Intensive Care and the head of the Infectology Department. These efforts were backed up by the Pan American Health Organization and health authorities of countries such as Brazil and Colombia.

The patient is stable and recovering, with physical rehab therapy.

[The Milwaukee protocol, sometimes referred to as the Wisconsin protocol, is an experimental course of treatment of a rabies infection in a human being. The treatment involves putting the patient into a chemically induced coma and administering antiviral drugs [1].

It was developed and named by Rodney Willoughby, Jr, following the successful treatment of Jeanna Giese. Giese, a teenager from Wisconsin, became the 1st patient known to have survived rabies without receiving the rabies vaccine. - Mod.PMB]
