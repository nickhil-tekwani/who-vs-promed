POWER LOSS, PLUM ISLAND - USA (NY)

The 3-hour loss of power and the failure of all 3 backup generators at the
Plum Island Animal Disease Center in mid-December [2002] do raise fears that
the containment of infectious pathogens could have been seriously
compromised, and renew concerns about the safety of high-security labs in
general. The threat of emerging infectious diseases (unintentional and
intentional) raises the importance of reliable back-up power for biomedical
institutions.
Even optimally maintained back-up diesel generators may fail to cover
sustained power outages [such as] occurred at Columbia Presbyterian Medical
Center in NYC in the summer of 1999. During the 3-week July heatwave there a
blackout occurred in upper Manhattan, and back-up generators successively
failed, one after another. Columbia lost biomedical research (tissue
cultures, etc.) in 2 buildings. (The story was covered on the front page of
the NY Times.) In another incident in a Rhode Island hospital, a patient's
death has been attributed to a failure of power and back-up generators. (The
case is still in litigation.)
Such failures are encouraging several medical schools to install fuel cells
for back-up and even primary power generation. In the private sector the
Bank of Omaha has already installed a large unit to ensure the continuity of
transactions that take place somewhere across the globe, day or night. Fuel
cells burn hydrogen (still from natural gas, thus some carbon must be
sequestered, as yet) and produce usable hot water (the "cogeneration"
boosting efficiency 2-fold at least).
Fuel cells provide on-site power, i.e., non-centralized, distributed
generation. They are built-in systems that involve redundant pathways and
are thus considered 99.99999% reliable.
Fuel cells are still expensive. But there are numerous reasons to consider
them, that include:
1. The vulnerability of diesel back-up systems;
2. The expanding work related to EIDs (emerging infectious diseases of
humans, wildlife, and plants);
3. The potential for increased blackouts due to more extreme weather
events;
4. The need for clean, non-polluting power sources; and
5. The vulnerability of the electricity grid itself to interruption and
attack.
Biomedical institutions and those planning for bioterrorism should strongly
consider budgeting for and seeking federal financial incentives to install
fuel cells as integral to ensuring our safety, security, and health.
