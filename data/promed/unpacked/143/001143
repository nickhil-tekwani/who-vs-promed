A 2nd Maui man might have contracted botulism after eating a
nationally recalled product. On Fri 27 Jul 2007 a 35-year-old checked
into the Maui Memorial Medical Center, where he was told that he has
a mild case of botulism. He was released that afternoon. It is the
2nd possible case of botulism within a week. In both instances the
men reportedly ate a can of Cattle Drive chili before falling sick.
"It's kind of a shock," he said. "I just wish there'd been more
warnings with the (food) labels that are familiar to us in Hawaii."
The man, from Wailuku, last ate a can of Cattle Drive chili on 20 Jul
2007, a day before the chili maker, Castleberry's Food Co., recalled
more than 90 brands of chili, stew and other food products that could
contain the poisonous bacterium's toxin.
Several of the Augusta, GA, company's products have been removed from
store shelves in Hawaii. He had bought the chili from Costco in
Kahului, which has since stopped selling the products.
The man ate most the can with nachos before having flulike symptoms
that afternoon. "It felt like I was just sick," he said. "I was
feeling very tired, loss of energy, kind of lethargic." He also had
diarrhea and a tingling sensation in his head and shoulders. Later,
he had tingling and pain in his fingers, and his vision began
blurring. Through the week, however, the symptoms began to diminish.
On 27 Jul 2007, after learning through e-mail about a Maui man
sickened after eating a recalled product, the man immediately went to
the emergency room. Doctors told him it was likely botulism and that
it could take months for the symptoms to subside while the toxin
worked its way out of his system. Afterward, a state epidemiologist
called and asked him about his illness.
Janice Okubo, spokeswoman for the state Department of Health, said,
"We were contacted by the hospital, so we are checking on it."
To confirm cases of botulism, samples need to be sent to the CDC in
Atlanta. Okubo said interviews with the man will warrant whether
samples should be taken.
On Thu 26 Jul 2007 a 33-year-old man from Hana went to Maui Memorial
Medical Center with muscle weakness and facial paralysis. Stockton
has the clinical criteria for botulism, and his samples will be sent
to the CDC, the state Health Department said. He was released Sat 28 Jul 2007.
A total of 2 people in Texas and 2 people in Indiana were confirmed
to have been sickened from contaminated food.

[These 2 cases were clearly mild and whether they, in fact, are due
to botulism remains to be determined. A discussion regarding sensory
symptoms in botulism can be found in the last part of this posting.

State and county health officials said Fri 27 Jul 2007 that a
51-year-old San Diego County woman had been hospitalized and
diagnosed with botulism, but they were not sure if the woman got sick
from any of the dozens of brands of canned foods recalled recently.
State public health spokeswoman Lea Brooks said health workers were
still trying to determine if the woman, who has recovered and been
sent home, might have gotten sick from eating Castleberry Food
Company products.
Neither state nor county officials would say what part of the county
the woman lived in. They said she was hospitalized for 10 days about
a week after buying and eating Kroger chili with beans, one of
several brands produced by Castleberry.

[3] Possible Ohio cases

State and local health authorities are investigating 8 cases that may
be connected to a botulism outbreak linked to chili sauce, hash and
other canned products. The Ohio Department of Health laboratory could
have preliminary results on some of the blood and stool samples next
week provided the specimens are good enough for analysis, said
department spokesman Kristopher Weiss. Tests confirming botulism will
take longer, though.
The samples are being sent from Cuyahoga, Huron, Greene, Vinton and
Wood counties, Weiss said. The state did not release any details on
the identity of the samples. The Cleveland Health Department reminded
retailers this week to keep their shelves clear of the recalled
items. They also notified the Cleveland Food Bank, which stocks a lot
of canned goods in its pantry.
The Cuyahoga County Health Department said it confirmed with
manufacturers where the products were shipped and followed up with
e-mail, calls and visits to local grocery stores to make sure canned
goods implicated in the recall had not "slipped through the cracks."
Stores nationwide are continuing to sell recalled canned chili, stew,
hash and other foods potentially contaminated with poisonous bacteria
even after repeated warnings the products could kill.
Thousands of cans are being removed from store shelves as quickly as
investigators find them, more than a week after Castleberry's Food
Co. began recalling more than 90 potentially contaminated products
over fears of botulism contamination. The recall now covers 2 years'
production at the company's Augusta, GA, plant, a tally that spirals
into the tens of millions of cans.

[As with the original 4 cases from Indiana and Texas as well as the
toxin identified from the cans, the serotype of botulinum toxin here
is either not yet identified or is not stated.
The counties in the midwestern American state of Ohio can be seen at:
<http://www.search.com/reference/List_of_counties_in_Ohio?redir=1>.
As can be seen, the reported counties with cases are scattered
throughout the state.
Overall, in a review of foodborne botulism in the USA from 1990-2000
which involved 160 events and 263 cases (1), of the events 50 percent
were toxin type A, 14 percent type B, 33 percent type E, 1 percent
type F and 2 percent unknown. The food sources of the 160 events
included 47 noncommercial, home canned sources (the most common was
asparagus); 21 noncommercial, not home canned sources (the most
common was soup); 5 different commercial sources (2 different fish, 1
burrito, 1 clam chowder and 1 bean dip); 2 restaurant-made sources
(cheese sauce, potato dip); and 58 sources from Alaska involving
noncommercial marine sources including seal oil, fermented sea
mammals and fish eggs.

[4] Problems with recall
Date: Fri 27 Jul 2007

Stores nationwide are continuing to sell recalled canned chili, stew,
hash and other foods potentially contaminated with botulism even
after repeated warnings the products could kill.
Thousands of cans are being removed from store shelves as quickly as
investigators find them, more than a week after Castleberry's Food
Co. began recalling more than 90 potentially contaminated products
over fears of botulism contamination. The recall now covers 2 years'
production at the company's Augusta, GA, plant, a tally that spirals
into the tens of millions of cans.
Spot checks by the FDA and state officials continue to turn up
recalled products for sale in convenience stores, gas stations and
family run groceries, from Florida to Alaska. The FDA alone has found
them in roughly 250 of the more than 3700 stores visited in
nationwide checks, according to figures the agency provided to The
Associated Press.
In states like North Carolina, more than 1 in 3 stores checked by
state officials in recent days were still offering recalled products
for sale. Officials there pulled 5500 cans and pledged to keep
searching. "We're not going to quit. These numbers are too high,"
said Joe Reardon, who oversees food protection for the state
Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services.
A total of 4 people have been sickened and hospitalized because of
the contaminated food, according to the CDC. Officials fear the tally
will grow. California health officials are investigating whether
botulism confirmed in a San Diego County woman was linked to the
recall. The woman reported eating a Castleberry's product before
falling sick in early July 2007.
"Frankly, the fact we have had only 4 illnesses in this situation has
people saying, 'Well, what is the big deal?' The deal is this is
something that can land you in the ICU, not being able to breathe,
for weeks," said Dr. David Acheson, the FDA's lead food safety expert.
FDA investigators believe Castleberry's failed to properly cook some
or all the products, allowing the _Clostridium botulinum_ bacteria to
survive the canning process. In the oxygen-free and moist environment
of the sealed cans, the bacteria thrive and produce a toxin that
causes botulism, a muscle-paralyzing disease. "The longer this stuff
stays in the can, the worse it gets," Acheson said.
The bacteria also produce gases that can cause contaminated cans to
swell and burst. Already, cans being held in a company warehouse have
begun to break open. Health officials say the extremely potent toxin
can infect people if it is inhaled, swallowed or absorbed through the
eye or breaks in the skin.
Health experts consider botulism a severe health threat but worry
that word of the recall has not reached all consumers or retailers,
especially mom-and-pop operations.
"It has been a problem getting the message out. We're having a
problem reaching the smaller stores," said Lynae Granzow, an
epidemiologist with the Indiana Department of Health.
In Massachusetts, health inspectors found recalled products in fewer
than 50 small stores, mostly in the Boston area, state Department of
Public Health spokeswoman Donna Rheaume said. Spot checks in Alaska,
Florida, Kentucky, Montana, New York, Indiana and elsewhere also have
found them on shelves.

[Clearly the recall protocol has not been effective in clearing
shelves of the potentially lethal products to this point and work is
continuing in this regard. A better, electronic system of tracking
all the cans is clearly needed. The potential seriousness of the
illness cannot be overemphasized.
As mentioned in the posting, the toxin can be spread by inhalation as
well as by ingestion or, with wound and infant botulism, by _in situ_
production of toxin in the cutaneous or gastrointestinal areas. In
the Working Group on Civilian Biodefense's review on botulinum toxin
as a biological weapon (1), the following is stated (with the
citations removed):
"A 4th, man-made form that results from aerosolized botulinum toxin
is inhalational botulism. This mode of transmission has been
demonstrated experimentally in primates, has been attempted by
bioterrorists, and has been the intended outcome of at least one
country's specially designed missiles and artillery shells.
Inhalational botulism has occurred accidentally in humans. A brief
report from West Germany in 1962 described 3 veterinary personnel who
were exposed to reaerosolized botulinum toxin while disposing of
rabbits and guinea pigs whose fur was coated with aerosolized type A
botulinum toxin. Type A botulinum toxin was detected in serum samples
from all 3 affected individuals."
The laboratory incident citation (2) is in German. All 3 individuals
developed weakness, were treated with antitoxin, and survived. As I
recall, none required respiratory support. Unlike many other
biological warfare agents, the symptoms of intentional spread of
botulism are no different than those of natural disease. Suspicions
should arise when a large number of cases occur as happened in the
recent Thai cluster (which was not intentional).

[5] Sensory symptoms in botulism
Date: Sun 29 Jul 2007 21:18:44 -0500
From: Tom Bleck <tbleck@gmail.com>

Botulinum toxin does not cause a motor neuropathy; it produces a
presynaptic disorder resulting in failure of acetylcholine release at
both nicotinic (neuromuscular junction) and muscarinic
(parasympathetic) synapses. However, it does not cause facial (or any
other kind of) numbness. Other toxins, including those potentially
produced in inadequately controlled canning, might do this, but not
botulinum toxin itself.

[ProMED thanks Dr. Bleck for his comments. Indeed, it is classical
teaching that the botulinum toxins do not cause a sensory changes or
motor neuropathy. The mechanism of action varies depending on the
toxin type but all do block neuromuscular transmission at synapses
causing problems with SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive
factor attachment protein receptor) proteins.
Toxin types A, C1, and E cleave synaptosomal-associated proteins of
25 kDa (SNAP-25). Types B, D, F, and G cleave vesicle-associated
membrane protein (VAMP), also known as synaptobrevin. Proteolytic
cleavage of the SNAREs disables the exocytotic machinery, and thus
exocytosis of acetylcholine is inhibited. When the target tissue is a
muscle, this chemical denervation results in paresis. Type A toxin
causes an amazingly extended neuroparalysis that lasts for months in
humans. Such a prolonged therapeutic effect has been attributed to 1)
a long lifetime of the toxin's protease activity, 2) anchoring of the
light chain to the presynaptic membrane, 3) persistence of the
toxin-truncated SNAP-25, and 4) endplate remodeling. In vivo imaging
of individual nerve terminals in mouse muscle revealed that blockade
of acetylcholine release results in nerve sprouting, with the
creation of functional synapses extra-junctionally. On the eventual
recovery of endocytotic/exocytotic activity at the parent terminals,
retraction of the sprouts occurs with a return to the exact compact
shape of the original endplate. (Source:
<http://www.neurotoxininstitute.org/chapter_moa_print.htm>.)
However, several reports have appeared in the literature suggesting
that sensory abnormalities may be linked to botulism (1, 2). As
noted by Dr. Bleck, the etiology may not be botulinum toxin itself.
