---------------------------------------------
Each year, ProMED-mail presents an award in honor of the anniversary of its founding in August 1994. This year, a little past our 19th birthday, we are pleased to announce that the 2013 ProMED-mail Award for Excellence in Outbreak Reporting on the Internet goes to HealthMap/Boston Children's Hospital Informatics Program web software developer, Susan Aman.

There have been many improvements to the technology infrastructure of ProMED in the past several years, some visible to our participants and some only visible to the ProMED editors, moderators and staff. Sue has been instrumental in nearly all of these changes. You can see the improved design, usability and readability of our website, but equally important, she has worked to develop a workflow "dashboard" that streamlines and speeds the flow of reports so that we can process our work faster, more accurately, and more efficiently. Equally important are her people skills; she always understands the human factors that go into web design and workflow and responds quickly and with unfailing good humor to our numerous requests and comments.

ProMED is pleased to present this award to her in appreciation for her dedication and hard work.
