A Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) case has been confirmed in a resident of Shymkent, Kazakhstan, near the border of Uzbekistan.

According to local media, "The citizen was at field work on the territory of the Turkestan region, upon arrival he was at home and after a few days he began to develop clinical manifestations. At home, he did the treatment himself and on the 3rd day of the disease called an ambulance and was hospitalized in the city infectious diseases hospital, "said Galymzhan Abishev, deputy head of the department for quality control and safety of goods and services in Shymkent.

The patient's condition, according to the deputy chief sanitary doctor of Shymkent, was difficult, but thanks to the competent work of doctors, the man began to recover.

In 2019, one CCHF case was reported in Shymkent. Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever is a widespread disease caused by a tick-borne virus (_Orthonairovirus_) of the Nairoviridae family. The CCHF virus causes severe viral hemorrhagic fever outbreaks, with a case fatality rate of 10-40%.

Animals become infected by the bite of infected ticks and the virus remains in their bloodstream for about one week after infection, allowing the tick-animal-tick cycle to continue when another tick bites. Although a number of tick genera are capable of becoming infected with CCHF virus, ticks of the genus _Hyalomma_ are the principal vector.

The CCHF virus is transmitted to people either by tick bites or through contact with infected animal blood or tissues during and immediately after slaughter. The majority of cases have occurred in people involved in the livestock industry, such as agricultural workers, slaughterhouse workers, and veterinarians. Human-to-human transmission is possible.

[Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) cases have been reported with some frequency in Kazakhstan in past years. CCHF virus is categorized as an "especially dangerous pathogen" in Kazakhstan and it is prioritized for surveillance and treatment.

CCHF virus is a tick-borne pathogen that causes severe disease in people, with a distribution that extends from central Asia to southern Africa. In addition to tick bites, contact with bodily fluids from viremic livestock or from symptomatic humans are risk factors for infection.

The main vector of CCHF virus in Central Asia are ticks of the genus _Hyalomma_, and in Kazakhstan the vectors of this virus also include the ixodid tick _Dermacentor niveus_ (http://europepmc.org/abstract/med/15773396).

The case in the report above has a history of travel, but there is no mention of a tick bite. - Mod.UBA
