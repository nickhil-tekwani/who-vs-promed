--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wheat stem rust caused by the fungus _Puccinia graminis_ f.sp. _tritici_ is a notorious disease of wheat and barley. In western Europe, following many decades of absence the disease started to re-emerge in 2013 with sporadic outbreaks reported in Germany [ProMED-mail post 20140404.2379670], Sweden, Denmark, [and] a single [infected] wheat plant in the UK. These outbreaks were seen as an early warning of a potential resurgence. A much larger outbreak was recorded in Sicily in 2016 [ProMED-mail post 20170206.4820305].

The pathogen is heteroecious undertaking asexual reproduction on cereals and grasses and completing its sexual cycle on common barberry (_Berberis vulgaris_) and other species in the genus. The importance of the alternate host as a source of genetically diverse inoculum historically led to legislation to limit its presence particularly in western Europe, USA, and Canada. However, due to the absence of the disease, _B. vulgaris_ has been increasing in prevalence. Accordingly, a wheat stem rust outbreak in Sweden in 2017 occurred in an area where _B. vulgaris_ was located.

In mid-July to early August 2019, we identified symptoms typical of stem rust on approximately 20 late-sown spring barley plants in Suffolk [England]. These plants were on the edge of a field within metres of a _B. vulgaris_ hedgerow that was also heavily infected. PCR products from infected barley stems and aecia on _B. vulgaris_ leaves were sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed (i) the presence of _P. graminis_, and (ii) that _P. graminis_ sequences from barley and _B. vulgaris_ clustered with other _P. graminis formae speciales_ that predominantly infect wheat (_Triticum aestivum_) and barley (_Hordeum vulgare_), wild rye (_Secale strictum_), and couch grass (_Elymus_ spp.).

This report illustrates that stem rust can be identified late in the season on barley in the UK, most likely caused by inoculum originating on neighbouring _B. vulgaris_. Early maturation of UK wheat and barley varieties may currently act as a control mechanism. However, as the climate continues to shift, earlier summer temperatures could encourage wheat stem rust re-emergence, as was seen during the outbreak in 2013 in Germany. This supports the need for enhanced vigilance and monitoring across cereals and grasses in the UK.

[Wheat stem rust (_Puccinia graminis_, previously f.sp. _tritici_) has been reported to cause overall yield losses of up to 80 percent, but some fields are totally destroyed. Barley is also susceptible to this pathogen. Stem rust spores are spread by wind and with infected straw or other contaminated materials. The fungus can survive between seasons on some grasses or volunteer wheat generating a "green bridge". Alternatively, it can also produce hardy teliospores which in the next season infect members of the genus _Berberis_, which then serve as a source of crop inoculum. Disease monitoring is important so that timely action can be taken to limit the spread of the pathogen as well as build-up of inoculum. Disease management may include fungicide applications, control of volunteer wheat, and resistant varieties if available.

Races with increased virulence are emerging frequently and resistance breeding programmes have been set up by several countries or international groups. One of the most serious threats at present is considered to be the Ug99 family of strains (first discovered in Uganda in 1999), which have overcome the major resistance gene Sr31 used in our current wheat varieties. Additional resistance genes have been overcome by subsequent variants (see for example, ProMED-mail post 20100602.1834). New strains not related to Ug99 are also posing a danger, for example the Digalu strain with 2 distinct genotypes spreading in Europe and present in the UK (ProMED-mail post 20180219.5638265), for which variants with virulence to 4 additional host resistance genes have been identified.

Due to the long absence of the disease from Europe, many wheat varieties planted in the region are susceptible. In addition in the UK, barberry as habitat for the endangered barberry carpet moth has been [planted] increasingly. Barberry plays a key role in the life cycle of several rust pathogens including wheat stem rust.

Barley can also be infected by 2 other rusts, rye stem rust (_P. graminis_ f. sp. _secalis_) and a hybrid between the wheat and rye pathogens most commonly found on the grass _Elymus scaber_ ("scabrum rust"; see links below).
