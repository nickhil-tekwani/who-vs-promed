[Since the start of the Turkish LSD epizootic in August 2013, 17 outbreaks have been reported there; see summary and map at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=14106. Please note that 2 of the new outbreaks are located in the Hatay province, southern Turkey, on the Mediterranean coast, bordering Syria on its south and east.

For a map of the 2013 LSD situation in the region, subscribers are referred to the OIE map at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/Diseaseoutbreakmaps (select lumpy skin disease, period from 1 Jan 2013, centre, and zoom in). In addition to Turkey, the disease has been reported during 2013 from Israel, Jordan, the Palestinian authority (West Bank), Lebanon, Iraq, and Egypt (where LSD has been endemic since the late 1980s). It may be assumed that the LSD virus has also been circulating in other countries in the region, particularly Syria. - Mod.AS
