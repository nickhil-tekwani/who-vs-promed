"Currently, the quarantine in the village of Kakashura, Karabudakhkent region, has been lifted. No new cases of infection were found during the monitoring of residents' health. In addition, the cattle in the village are fully vaccinated," said the source.

[This is the good news. No new human cases, the area cleaned up, and the livestock vaccinated. There was a wealth of government activity and so this good report. They do not mention the results of any investigations and sampling to determine a possible source, nor on the total number of animals that may have died. Prompt vaccination did its proper job.

With thanks to Mahmoud.

Dagestan is an autonomous republic of Russia. It is small -- 19 400 square miles and 2.9 million people -- on the north west Caspian Sea coast and adjoins Azerbaijan, Chechnya, and Georgia. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dagestan). - Mod.MHJ
