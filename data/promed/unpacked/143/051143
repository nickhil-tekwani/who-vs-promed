Re: Influenza (47): vaccine-associated enhanced disease
-------------------------------------------------------
The potential for sub-neutralizing levels of antiviral antibody to enhance infection is well known, and has been studied for many decades. James Porterfield and his colleagues demonstrated a potential molecular mechanism for the phenomenon, by which immunoglobulin, bound to a virus envelope glycoprotein, enables enhanced uptake of virus particles by FcR-bearing phagocytes (particularly blood monocytes), leading to up to 100-fold enhancement of virus replication in a model system (see, for example, Porterfield, 1981 Journal of Hygiene 89, 355-64). This "antibody-dependent enhancement" [A.D.E.] effect was advanced by Scott Halstead and others as the mechanism by which severe (haemorrhagic) disease sometimes follows infection of patients by one serotype of dengue virus who have previously been infected by a different serotype (see Halstead, 1979 Journal of Infectious Diseases 140, 527-33). This remains unresolved. A.D.E. was also implicated in rabies early death syndrome by Neal Nathanson and colleagues in 1981 (Nature, 290, 590-1), in which exposed individuals are vaccinated rather late, and then die earlier than usual. It is notoriously hard to prove the role of A.D.E. in clinical cases, but in experimental animals, the potential for vaccine-associated A.D.E. to result in enhanced infection and early death was demonstrated by Allen Barrett and Ernie Gould in 1986 for yellow fever virus (http://vir.sgmjournals.org/content/67/11/2539.full.pdf).

In the case of the arbovirus infections, A.D.E. is particularly plausible as the monocyte is a key host cell in vivo for both virus replication and pathogenesis. With influenza, it is a little less likely, because it appears that infection of alveolar macrophages is associated with milder disease.

[ProMED-mail thanks William James for drawing attention to the well-established phenomenon of antibody-dependent enhancement. Although not demonstrated so far in relation to influenza virus infection, it is a phenomenon that deserves investigation in relation to influenza virus vaccine development. - Mod.CP]
