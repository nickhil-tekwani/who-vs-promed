[Prof. Hal Nash became interested in the possible links between
infection & chronic disease, partly through reading ProMED-mail.
We commissioned him to provide a summary of the current state of
knowledge, which will be posted in several parts, all with titles
beginning:
"Chronic disease"
- Jack Woodall, Director, ProMED-mail

Coxsackie B4 and Diabetes Type I
------------------------------------------
Evidence exists for a link between prior enterovirus infection and
the onset of type I diabetes. The enterovirus most often implicated
is Coxsackie B4. Study is underway to determine which, if any, of
the viral proteins elicits the autoimmune response typical of this
form of diabetes.
It appears that it still cannot be said that Coxsackie B4 virus
causes type I diabetes. However, the evidence seems to have
established this virus as a trigger to the development of diabetes.
In addition, a study was done in which eight individuals with chronic
fatigue syndrome were positive for enteroviral sequences related to
the Coxsackie B-like viruses.
NOTE: A ProMED-mail post of 12 Jul 1998 from Tuan-Gee Yap
<tgyap@pc.jaring.my> (Enterovirus & diabetes, association?-Taiwan)
typifies the potential that ProMED-mail has for sparking proactive
attempts to minimize the effect of emerging diseases. The Taiwan
enterovirus outbreak paralleled an outbreak in Poland in 1982 of
enterovirus followed by a near doubling of juvenile diabetes cases
in the next 5 years. Considering the strong association between
enterovirus and diabetes, and the recent (and apparently recurrent)
enterovirus outbreak in Taiwan, health care workers should be alerted
to the early signs and symptoms of juvenile diabetes.

Retrovirus implicated in Type I Diabetes
-------------------------------------------------
A retroviral antigen, produced from an integrated retrovirus, has
been shown to trigger lymphocyte activation and the subsequent
destruction of beta cells in pancreatic islets (Islands of
Langerhans) leading to diabetes.
Comments from some respondents indicated that the etiology of
diabetes type I is likely not one agent, but rather multifactorial.
The addition of a retrovirus to the list of suspected etiologic
agents of diabetes type I lends weight to the recent pronouncement by
the World Health Organization that by the year 2010, there will be
240 million diabetics, with the majority in developing nations.
