Kinmen [in Fukien Province] started to cull 198 cattle on or around a ranch in Jinning Township, which was found to have cattle infected with foot-and-mouth disease [FMD], Saturday [9 May 2015] afternoon with planned completion in 2 days, the county government said the same day.

The virus, confirmed as type-A foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), was found for the 1st time in the Republic of China (Taiwan) in the meat of a slaughtered cow from the farm, Council of Agriculture (COA) Deputy Minister Wang Cheng-teng said Friday [8 May 2015]. Further tests revealed that another cow on the farm was infected with the virus, Wang said, adding that the animal has [been] euthanized.

The virus strain was tested with 99.9 percent similarity to a virus strain found in Guangdong Province, China, in 2013, the COA said.

Wang said the virus originated in China and may have been transported via the "mini 3 links" between China's Fujian Province and Kinmen, which is located off the southeast coast of China, about 10 km from Xiamen City [see comment].

A total of 110 processed products, mostly specialty gourmet gifts bought by tourists, from livestock in Kinmen were barred from entering the rest of the nation, the COA said Saturday.

The county's magistrate, Chen Fu-hai, on Friday called a meeting and set up a task force to respond to FMD on cloven-hoofed animals in the outlying island county.

In the meeting, Chen said that the county government had to verify which cows were suspect and not cull those which were not. It also dealt with what response and quarantine measures should be done according to a standard operating procedure and made plans to reduce the loss of products being barred from transport out of the county.

Kinmen has a livestock population of more than 15 000, with the number of swine a bit higher than that of cattle, according to the COA. Kinmen (also known as Quemoy) counts beef jerky as one of its most popular food products.

Chen called Chang Shu-hsien, head of COA's Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine, Saturday to call for the decrease of products being barred from transport out of the county and to ask for monetary assistance from the Cabinet for the loss incurred and expense of culling the cattle.

[Dr Ping-Cheng Yang, Vice President, Agriculture Technology Research Institute, Council of Agriculture, Hsinchu City, Chinese Taipei, has submitted to OIE an immediate report on the above outbreak on 8 May 2015; see, with an interactive map at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=17682&newlang=en. As can be seen in the map. Kinmen island is close to mainland China's coast.

The so-called 'Little 3 Links', also referred to as 'Mini 3 Links' or '3 Small Links', agreed between PRC and ROC, allows for limited postal, transportation, and trade links between the People's Republic of China's Fujian province cities of Xiamen, Mawei and Quanzhou, and the islands of Kinmen and Matsu, which are administered by the Republic of China (Taiwan).

The OIE report includes the following epidemiological comments: "Non-structural protein (NSP) antibody reactions were detected in 2 cattle in a farm located in Kinmen County during routine serological surveillance. The local disease control center (LDCC) traced back to their farm of origin to conduct movement restrictions, clinical investigation and sampling of sera and oropharyngeal fluid for serological and virological tests. All cattle within the index farm were found in healthy condition without clinical signs of foot and mouth disease (FMD). After retesting on 1 May 2015, NSP antibody reaction was still detected in 1 out of the 2 cattle. The positive cattle were subsequently culled as a precaution measure by the LDCC on 2 May 2015. The result of PCR on 8 May 2015, carried out by the National Laboratory (Animal Health Research Institute, AHRI), showed positive reaction to nucleic acid of FMD virus in that cattle. The positive PCR sample was retested and the obtained product was analyzed. The case was finally confirmed as A serotype FMD infection by AHRI on 8 May 2015. Detailed genetic and phylogenetic analyses of the genomic sequences showed that the strain was most closely (99 percent) related to the A serotype strain isolated in Guangdong Province of China in 2013. All the cattle on the infected farm, including 100 heads of cattle from neighboring farms, will be culled. Epidemiological investigation and surveillance of surrounding cloven-hoofed animal farms will be implemented".
