Hantavirus Infection Recorded in Santiago Metropolitan Area
-----------------------------------------------------------
SANTIAGO, Chile: A 33-year-old Santiago resident was hospitalized Wednesday
with the first case of a hantavirus infection to be contracted in the
Santiago Metropolitan Region. The woman was apparently exposed to the
virus, which is fatal in up to 60 percent of cases, in the town of
Melipilla, 60 km south of downtown Santiago. [Certain hantaviruses are
highly contagious and can be contracted by breathing, touching or ingesting
the feces, urine or saliva of an infected rodent. The most common carrier
in Chile is the long-tailed rat [_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_, which is
found the length of Chile, from the northern Region III through Region XI
in the south.
Ministry of Education (Minsal) Minister Michelle Bachelet expressed fears
that unusually wet weather in Chile over the past 2 years might have
created ideal conditions for an outbreak of hantavirus infection this
(southern hemisphere) summer. Although the detection of a hantavirus in the
metropolitan region is alarming due to the area's high population density,
the virus is more prevalent in the south, Chile's most popular tourist
region. Bachelet says that as Chile prepares to enter its peak tourist
season, Minsal is reviewing and expanding its hantavirus educational
campaign. In addition to travelers and tourists, the campaign will focus on
other high risk areas and populations, such as rural communities and
agricultural and forestry workers. Bachelet said the campaign will
emphasize precautionary measures, such as cleaning homes with bleach,
keeping food in sealed containers, ventilating abandoned or infrequently
used houses for 30 minutes prior to entry and burying trash at least 50 cm
below ground. Hikers and campers, meanwhile, should choose clean areas to
pitch tents, never sleep directly on the ground, bury trash and avoid
abandoned or infrequently used structures such as outhouses and shelters.
To date, 124 people are known to have contracted Hantavirus Pulmonary
Syndrome (HPS) in Chile, of whom 61 have died. Between January and August
of this year, 24 cases of HPS have been documented, as compared to 19 cases
in the same period of 1999. A total of 10 people have died of the virus so
far this year. According to Bachelet, the woman hospitalized Wednesday
contracted a mild form of the virus that causes fever, muscle pain and
diarrhea but does not effect the lungs and is not fatal. After the woman
was diagnosed with the virus, Metropolitan Environmental Health Services
and similar services in Occidente and Valparaiso tested 10 people who were
with or near the woman when she contracted the disease. The health services
also disinfected local buildings, removed rodents from residential areas
and initiated educational campaigns for families in the sector.

[Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS), first recognized in 1993 after a
cluster of acute respiratory distress syndrome deaths in the southwestern
United States, is now considered a pan-American zoonosis. HPS is
characterized by fever, myalgia, gastrointestinal symptoms, and headache,
with subsequent characteristic cardiopulmonary dysfunction. The etiologic
agent was identified as a virus belonging to the genus _Hantavirus_ of the
family _Bunyaviridae_, and named Sin Nombre virus (SNV), After SNV was
identified, numerous other New World hantaviruses were identified
throughout the Americas by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR) amplification of viral RNA from captured antibody-positive rodents
and, occasionally, from infected patients. HPS was first identified in
Chile in 1995 in the Cochamo, Los Lagos region. Genetic sequencing of
RT-PCR products from the autopsy tissues of another patient presumptively
infected in this region in 1996 confirmed infection with Andes virus, which
had previously been identified in southern Argentina as a cause of HPS,
with _Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_ postulated as the reservoir host (see
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol4no4/toro.htm> for detailed information).
This report is confusing in that the affected individual apparently
contracted the infection at a distance from Santiago and mild signs and
symptoms developed rather than typical HPS. It is not entirely clear
whether the diagnosis of hantavirus infection is supported by laboratory
confirmation. - Mod.CP
