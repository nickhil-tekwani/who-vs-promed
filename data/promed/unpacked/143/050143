[Rabbit hemorrhagic disease (RHD) is an extremely contagious and often fatal viral disease of domesticated and wild rabbits. There is no indication that the rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus infects humans (http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/rabbit_hemorrhagic_disease.pdf).

For background information on rabbit hemorrhagic disease, please refer to commentary in ProMED-mail archive 20140204.2252000.

Rabbit hemorrhagic disease is endemic in Australia, New Zealand, Cuba, parts of Asia and Africa, and most of Europe (http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/rabbit_hemorrhagic_disease.pdf). A map showing the distribution of the disease in domestic and/or wild species can be seen at
http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/Diseasedistributionmap (Note: to view the information on RHD, scroll down to the name of the disease and choose time period. To see with more detail the region of interest, click on the map to zoom in).

Sweden, the country bordering Norway, reported rabbit hemorrhagic disease in its last 6-monthly report (July-December 2013) as a "disease restricted to certain zone(s) of the country" (http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/statuslist).
