Last year [2018], 2 cases of whooping cough were identified by Northumbria Healthcare -- the 1st in its history and attributed to 'waning vaccination rates'. They were reported by Dr David Tate, director of infection prevention and control, as he presented his annual report for 2018-19 to the latest board meeting of the trust, which runs hospitals in Northumberland and North Tyneside.

The 2 unrelated incidents, which were also the 1st Dr Tate had seen in his career, were in November 2018 and March this year [2019], with one affecting a baby.

In response to a question from a board member, he said that Public Health England recognises that work needs to be done on the issues around social media and its impact on falling vaccination rates. However, there were a number of positives, with Dr Tate concluding: "There's nothing I'm particularly concerned about, but obviously infection control is a constant and ongoing battle."

The Conselleria de Sanitat [Ministry of Health of the Generalitat Valenciana] has detected an outbreak of whooping cough in the town of Requena, which has affected 7 people aged between 10 and 44 years.

According to sources from the Conselleria, the outbreak was declared on [27 May 2019] and to date there are 7 confirmed cases, although none have required hospitalization and all are evolving without complications.

The proceedings were initiated that same day, with the application of the protocol for pertussis surveillance and outbreak control, which includes recommendations for treatment and isolation of cases, and identification of contacts to review their vaccination status and administer prophylaxis antibiotic if applicable.

That same day, this information was also communicated to the school management so that they could send the parents an informative circular about whooping cough and its prevention, so that they could check the children's immunization status and contact their doctor or pediatrician in case of being high-risk contact.

https://www.pressherald.com/2019/06/07/pertussis-cases-continue-to-increase-in-maine/


Maine continues to experience a high rate of pertussis, with 39 new cases reported in May [2019] and a total of 208 cases so far this year [2019], well ahead of the 123 cases in the 1st 5 months of 2018, according to a report released [Fri 7 Jun 2019] by the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention.

Pertussis is a persistent public health problem in Maine, as the state has the worst per-capita pertussis rate in the nation. Maine's pertussis rate of 33.16 per 100 000 in 2018 was more than 8x the national average. Maine had 446 pertussis cases in 2018, but 2019 could eclipse last year, which was the worst year for pertussis since 2012.

Recent outbreaks occurred at Portland schools in May [2019], as well as earlier this year [2019] at Falmouth High School and Thornton Academy in Saco. Schools have been the source of many outbreaks this year, and 51 percent of all cases in 2019 -- 106 of the 208 cases -- have occurred in those between the ages of 11 and 19.

Meghan May, associate professor of microbiology at the University of New England, said low vaccination rates in Maine are "absolutely" a contributing factor, but there doesn't seem to be any one reason that pertussis is a problem in comparison to other infectious diseases such as measles. "It's a multifaceted problem with several different dynamics," said May, who has researched pertussis. "We don't know why it's pertussis here and not measles."

Maine is especially vulnerable to the return of infectious diseases such as pertussis, public health experts have said, because of the state's dangerously low levels of immunization rates in schools. Maine has consistently been among the worst in the nation for parents forgoing vaccines for non-medical reasons for students entering kindergarten, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The pertussis vaccine's effectiveness wanes, which is why pediatricians recommend a booster shot in middle school. Though Maine now requires the booster for incoming 7th-graders, it was among the last states in the nation to add the middle school booster, in 2017-18. And like all other school-required vaccines, parents can opt out of the pertussis booster or other immunizations for their children by signing a form. That will change for the 2021-22 school year.

Maine lawmakers passed a bill this spring and Gov. Janet Mills signed into law a measure that, starting in 2021, would eliminate philosophic and religious exemptions to school-required vaccines. Maine had 5.6 percent of parents signing philosophic or religious exemptions to vaccines for children entering kindergarten in 2018-19, according to the Maine CDC. 43 elementary schools had 15 percent or higher non-medical opt-out rates, putting those schools at increased risk of infectious disease outbreaks. Peter Michaud, counsel for the Maine Medical Association, which represents doctors before the Legislature, said over time, the new law will improve vaccination rates and Maine's pertussis rate should decline. "We are taking the steps that are available to us to protect Maine's children," Michaud said. "In the meantime, parents who have children who need their vaccines shouldn't wait until the law goes into effect. They can protect their children from contagions now."

[4] USA (California): waning immunity after vaccination with DTaP
Date: Mon 10 Jun 2019
Source: CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Response and Policy) [edited]

A child who has never been vaccinated against pertussis, or whooping cough, is 13 times more likely to suffer from an infection of _Bordetella pertussis_ than is a child who is up-to-date on his or her vaccines.

But new evidence from a decade-long study at Kaiser Permanente shows that vaccinated children were 5 times more likely to suffer from whooping cough if it had been more than 3 years since their last vaccine dose. The research was published today [10 Jun 20190] in Pediatrics [1].

DTaP vaccine, which protects against pertussis, diphtheria, and tetanus, is given in 5 doses between the ages of 2 months and 6 years. In this study, researchers from Kaiser Permanente Northern California followed children born between 1999 and 2016 who were diagnosed as having whooping cough.

The researchers identified 738 pertussis cases, with 99 cases in unvaccinated children, 36 in under-vaccinated children, 515 in fully vaccinated children (5 DTaP doses), and 88 in children who had received 6 doses of DTaP.

More than 80% of cases occurred in fully vaccinated children. Children only partially vaccinated were 1.9 times more likely to contract whooping cough than fully vaccinated peers.

"Although noncompliance with the vaccination schedule is an important public health problem that leads to increased pertussis risk, most children in our study received all their recommended DTaP doses," the authors wrote. "Our results reveal that waning of DTaP immunity was an important cause of pertussis in children."

In 2010 and 2014, California experienced 2 large pertussis outbreaks, with more than 9000 cases each.

This is the 3rd study completed by this researcher group to provide evidence of waning pertussis immunity, and the authors said results are consistent with other recent data that showed the odds of pertussis increased by 33% for every additional year after the third or the fifth DTaP dose.

Kathryn Edwards, MD, of the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, said in a commentary on the study [2] that the waning efficacy is likely because DTaP is an acellular vaccine, which replaced a whole-cell vaccine, DTwP, in 1997. Whole-cell vaccines, Edwards explains, generate more protective T-cell responses. After the introduction of a whole-cell pertussis vaccine in the United States, annual rates of the disease dropped from 150 per 100 000 in the 1940s to 1 per 100 000 in the 1970s in the United States.

Though efficacious, DTwP caused more reactions than DTaP, including febrile seizures and local injection-site reactions.

DTwP is no longer available in the United States or other high-income countries, so other strategies to boost pertussis immunity must be explored, including maternal vaccination and an intranasal booster dose of the vaccine, Edwards said.

Parents in the Williams Lake [British Columbia] area are being warned their children may have been exposed to pertussis, also known as whooping cough. School District 27 distributed letters from Interior Health [IH] this week [week of 3 Jun 2019] for parents outlining the symptoms and the fact pertussis can spread easily.

There have been about 30 cases throughout the IH region, and the majority of them have been in the Thompson-Cariboo so far in 2019, said Dr Karin Goodison, medical health officer with IH. "What we know about pertussis is, it sort of goes through cycles," Goodison said. "Every 3 to 5 years we see more cases. Last year [2018] we did not see many at all, but in 2016 and 2017 we saw a lot of cases. In 2019 we are starting to see some clusters of cases so we are going to be keeping an eye on that."

Vaccines are helpful in preventing pertussis, but they are not 100 per cent effective, Goodison added. "Unfortunately it's one of our vaccines that doesn't work as well as some of our other vaccines. Your chances of getting pertussis are much lower if you are a vaccinated, but you still can get the infection if you are exposed to someone who has it, particularly if it's been quite a while since you were immunized."

People at the highest risk are those who are under the age of one [year] and pregnant women, Goodison said. "When we are looking at offering pertussis immunization, our goal of the program is to protect those groups of people."

Overall in the Thompson-Cariboo, about 77 per cent of 2 year olds are up-to-date with pertussis immunizations and 74 per cent of 7 year olds, Goodison confirmed. "That's pretty good, compared to the rest of Interior Health, but we would like to see it higher."

If a person has had a persistent cough or been exposed to someone they know that has been diagnosed with pertussis, they should visit a care provider to get tested. "We see a few more cases throughout the spring and summer typically, so it's kind of got a seasonal pattern. It's quite interesting to look at it over time. If you look back in 2016 and 2017, the Thompson-Cariboo Shuswap had a very similar rate of illness as it does right now."

Work is being done to develop a better vaccine, recognizing that the protection from pertussis is not as long lasting, she added. In Canada, children are immunized for pertussis under the age of 2 and again when they are in school.

The [Cordoba] Provincial Health Ministry has verified a total of 56 cases of whooping cough in 2019, caused by the bacterium _Bordetella pertussis_, against the 19 registered in the same period last year [2018].

64% of the cases correspond to children younger than 6 months whose mothers had not been vaccinated.

This year [2019], the outbreak of respiratory diseases came earlier, with more serious illnesses. And it not only has to do with the lack of vaccination but also with a specific issue of the germ that is mutating and there tend to be increased cases every 4 years.
