--------------------------------------------------------
There have been questions regarding the bacteria that we isolated in
our dogs. The 1st was _Streptococcus equi_ subspecies _zooepidemicus_.
The 2nd dog's lung culture initially grew what was typed as
_Streptococcus equi_ subspecies _equi_ but the report was later
amended and it was retyped as subspecies _zooepidemicus_. If this info
could be updated somehow that would be much appreciated.

Also, the article states that it does not spread to humans, which is
incorrect. It is a zoonotic bacterium but most human cases have been
linked to contact with farm animals. Can this be altered?

[Dr Hutchings, we appreciate your update. Hopefully this posting will
serve to clarify some of the questions that have been raised about
this case and set the record straight.

The 2006 report "An outbreak of _Streptococcus equi_ subspecies
_zooepidemicus_ associated with consumption of fresh goat cheese" in
BMC Infect Dis. 2006 Feb 27; 6:36, does indicate that through
consumption this is a zoonotic disease. The entire article may be
found at
<http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/6/36>.
The article also indicates that it is a rare disease in humans,
associated with unpasteurized milk and with contact with horses. -
