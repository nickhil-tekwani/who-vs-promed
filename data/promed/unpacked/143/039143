An outbreak of legionnaires' disease has been identified in north-east
Spain among people who stayed in the natural spa resort of Cestona in the
province of Guipuzcoa between 1 and 22 May 1999.
The first case was diagnosed on 20 May. By 31 May 1999, two confirmed cases
had been diagnosed by legionella urine antigen detection test; there were
six suspected cases, and 35 people were being investigated. Local health
authorities have established that 432 people were staying in the resort
during the period under investigation.
Six visitors were from other European Union countries, four from the United
Kingdom and two from Portugal - none of [them is known to have become ill.
All people who may have been exposed have been identified and are being
investigated for legionella infection.
The spa resort was closed on 22 May. The regional public health director of
Pais Vasco (Basque Country) has informed all doctors and the general
public. The coordinating centre of the European Working Group on Legionalla
Infections was informed of the outbreak in order to follow up the possible
British and Portuguese cases and will be notified officially when all the
details of the cases have been obtained for reporting purposes. The
regional surveillance unit, in collaboration with the National Centre for
Epidemiology has begun an epidemiological and environmental investigation
to identify the source of the outbreak.
_Legionella pneumophila_serogroup (sg) 1 has been recovered from water
samples taken in the spa resort.
