The New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) announced the 2nd case human case of eastern equine encephalitis [EEE] was found this season [2014] in the state.

A press release says an adult in Hopkinton, N.H. [Merrimack County] tested positive for the illness. Due to this human case, DHHS says the risk for human illness in Hopkinton is high. Surrounding towns have a moderate risk. Other areas of the state currently considered at high risk are the Conway and Candia areas.

"Mosquito seasons are unpredictable," said DHHS Public Health Director Dr. Jose Montero. "West Nile virus was very common the last couple of years, but EEE [virus infection] was not as prevalent. This acts as a reminder that viruses change, mosquitoes fly, and there are many factors involved, so since we do know that both of these diseases are present in mosquitoes in New Hampshire, it is important that everyone remember to take steps to prevent mosquito bites to themselves and their loved ones."

The 1st human case of EEE was found on 22 Aug [2014] in Conway, N.H.

[This case, the 2nd in New Hampshire, is not surprising since it occurred within the geographical range of EEE virus in the eastern USA, where human and equine cases occur sporadically. As is usual, there are many more equine than human cases.

There was a recent case in New Hampshire involving a mule (see ProMED archive no. 20140906.2752704). The virus is maintained in passerine birds and transmitted among them by the black-tailed mosquito, _Culiseta melanura_. The species occasionally feeds on mammals and may have been the bridge transmitter in the above case.

There is a vaccine commercially available for equine administration but not for humans. Clinical cases in humans are very serious, with a case fatality rate of 33 per cent and significant neurological sequelae in survivors (see http://www.cdc.gov/EasternEquineEncephalitis/). It is prudent to follow the above recommendations to avoid mosquito bites.
