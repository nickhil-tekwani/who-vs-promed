The number of monkeys dead of yellow fever in Goias has risen to 7 in one month. The Epidemiological Secretariat [SES] stated that just in Goiania, 200 000 adults and 20 000 children still need to receive doses of the vaccine. Immunization is free and can be done at health centers. [A surprising number for a municipality where vaccination has been recommended for years. - Mod.RNA]

State superintendent of health surveillance, Fluvia Amorim, warns of the risk of virus circulation, which had not appeared in the state for 3 years.

"The death of the monkeys works as a warning to the entire population," said the superintendent. "It means that the virus has circulated again. The last cycle we had started in 2015 and ended in 2017. It is a preventable disease that has a vaccine, and there is no reason why people put themselves at risk."

According to the State Secretariat of Health (SES), until Thursday [29 Oct 2020], there was a record of the death of monkeys by the virus in 4 cities. The 1st 4 deaths were confirmed on 20 Oct [2020]. The secretary also points out that the animal is not a [direct] transmitter of the disease.

Cities that have registered monkeys dead of the disease [What species? In urban or forested areas? - Mod.RNA]:
- Goiania: 4
- Abadia de Goias: 1
- Aragoiania: 1
- Aparecida de Goiania: 1

In Goias, vaccination coverage for yellow fever in children under one year of age is 64% of the target, according to the SES. The superintendent explains that the 1st dose of vaccine is given at 9 months of age and a booster dose at 4 years of age. The vaccine can be found at health centers and is free. After taking both doses, the person is immune for life.

"Above 5 years, the person must have at least one dose registered on the [vaccination] card," explains Fluvia. "Whoever is not in this situation, the advice is to look for a vaccination post as soon as possible and get vaccinated."

According to the Ministry of Health, the most common symptoms of yellow fever are fever, body pain, weakness, diarrhea, and vomiting. The case fatality rate of the disease reaches 40%.

[There is no information about the location, the eco-epidemiological scenarios where the infected monkeys were identified. Wild? Periurban? Urban? Have entomological investigations been carried out? Have active searches been carried out for suspected human cases? Was barrier vaccination performed?

Concerning the potential number of susceptible people, especially since it is a state where vaccination has been recommended for years and years, the challenge will be to organize vaccination actions in a short time for more than 200 000 people in a scenario in which gatherings are not recommended.

Unfortunately, very unfortunately, it will come as no surprise should human case(s) occur. - Mod. RNA]

[The dead monkeys indicate that the virus has been circulating in the state again. It is important that the human population yellow fever [YF] vaccination coverage reach the 95% goal set by the Ministry of Health. Vaccination is the only way to avoid these sylvan (forest) cases, since elimination of the forest YF virus transmission cycle is not feasible. Without prevention of any resulting human sylvan cases, there is the risk that YF virus could be introduced by them into the urban cycle of virus transmitted by _Aedes aegypti_ and spread quickly.

Occurrence of fatality in non-human primates raises concern for public health and also about potential conservation problems for some endangered or threatened primate species such as brown howler monkeys and golden lion tamarins. The above report does not indicate which species of monkeys died. There is no orally administered vaccine available to vaccinate non-human primates in the wild. - Mod.TY
