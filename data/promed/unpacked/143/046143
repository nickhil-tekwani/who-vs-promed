----------------------------------------------------------------------
Just a comment regarding the recent post on the risk posed by Zika virus to New Zealand.

In my humble opinion it is erroneous to say that "there is no risk of ongoing transmission because there are no competent vectors for Zika virus in New Zealand." Unfortunately, very little is known about the New Zealand mosquito fauna and the ability of native species to vector exotic arbovirus. Further, in northern New Zealand (including Auckland, the country's largest city with a considerable Pacific Island population with frequent exchange of travellers between Pacific Islands and New Zealand) there are also non-native mosquitoes that are abundant and highly anthropophilic (in particular _Aedes notoscriptus_), which are vectors of related flaviviruses but whose vector competence for Zika virus is unknown.

For example, a laboratory study found _Aedes notoscriptus_ to be highly infective for chikungunya virus (87 per cent), but showing a low transmission rate (20 per cent). We have previously proposed that this relatively low transmission rate would likely be countered by the species' highly anthropophilic nature and high density in habitats closely associated with humans in northern New Zealand. The species may be similarly a vector of Zika virus.

Thus, although New Zealand lacks important mosquito vectors such as _Aedes aegypti_ and _Aedes albopictus_, possible local transmission in New Zealand summer-autumn cannot be simply disregarded. To assume that there is "no risk" of local transmission for either Zika virus or chikungunya virus in New Zealand could be a very costly mistake. Especially since the general population is mostly immunologically naive to exotic arboviruses.

Interestingly, New Zealand's close association with the Pacific Islands is shown by the much greater number of imported cases of Zika virus infection in comparison to its considerably larger neighbour Australia. The post certainly serves to highlight the heightened risk to New Zealand travellers to these destinations, such as the Cook Islands and Samoa. Thus, as with other mosquito-borne diseases, travellers should be advised to practice mosquito-avoidance behaviour (that is, insect repellents, protective clothing, bed nets, sleeping in screened accommodations, etc.).

[ProMED-mail is grateful to Jose Derraik for his insightful comments. He raises an especially important point -- one should not assume that arthropods that have not been laboratory tested for vector competence should not be automatically discarded as potential vectors of arboviruses. As the usual saying reminds us, "absence of evidence is not evidence of absence." One hopes that the imported Zika or chikungunya virus infections will raise the awareness of need and support for studies to determine vector competence of anthropophilic mosquitoes in New Zealand and elsewhere.
