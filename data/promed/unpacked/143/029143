Mongolia has diagnosed 10 anthrax infections
-----------------------------------------------
The Mongolian Disease Control and Disaster Prevention Bureau reported to
the media, on 7 Jul 2004, that 7 people in the province had reported having
fever, and, that an additional 3 persons had been diagnosed with anthrax.
According to the person in charge, during the period from the end of June
2004 to the beginning of July 2004, 10 people had come down with fever,
and, had had symptoms consistent with anthrax infection. As a result,
martial law had been enforced in the county. The milk supply area had been
disinfected, and cattle in the area had been vaccinated.
Confirmation of the source of infection is still pending. During the 1st
half of 2004, 20 people were diagnosed with anthrax in Mongolia, the
majority being infected through domestic animals [animals from household
farms].

[On the webpage of the above article, there were links to 2 earlier
articles: The 1st article mentioned an anthrax infection in a herdsman from
Ulaanbaatar, having been diagnosed on 4 May 2004 after contact with a cow
that died of probable anthrax. 23 800 cattle were vaccinated in the
surrounding region in response to that case
(<http://news.xinhuanet.com/world/2004-05/07/content_1455458.htm>).

The 2nd article referred to a case of anthrax, in a horse, in Kent
Province, with a resultant vaccination of more than 300 domestic animals
(<http://news.xinhuanet.com/world/2004-04/30/content_1449430.htm>). - Mod.MPP]

Ulaanbaatar: anthrax virus reported in the north
-----------------------------------------------
According to the National Center of Infectious Diseases with Natural Foci,
a citizen from the Ondor-Ulaan soum, Arkhangai, has been diagnosed
cutaneous anthrax. It is not clear how the patient was infected, although
none of those in direct contact with the patient have tested positive for
the [bacillus]. For now, the patient remains in isolation in the local
hospital.
3 people in Darkhan-Uul aimag, and 4 people in Selenge aimag [provinces],
are also in isolation, having shown symptoms of being exposed to the
anthrax virus [not a virus but a bacillus].

[Included with the above article from the UB Post was a reader's comments
posted on 8 Jul 2004: "Anthrax is a bacterial disease caused by _Bacillus
anthracis_ (_B. anthracis_). This disease has a world-wide distribution,
and, chiefly affects cattle, sheep, horses, pigs, and, less frequently,
other species of domesticated animals. The disease also occurs in a variety
of wild animals. Human infections with _B. anthracis_ are of animal origin,
and, usually occur through abrasions in the skin or mucous membranes, and,
less commonly, from inhalation. The incidence is relatively high among
those who handle infected carcasses, and animal products, including
bone-meal, feeding stuffs, hides, wool, and hair. The risk is particularly
great for veterinarians, farmers, and personnel working on docks and
factories, handling and processing these infected animal products. The
usual lesion is a malignant pustule that may take some 48 hours to develop,
following an infectious skin abrasion. Infection by inhalation of spores
can occur in certain commercial processes, for example, in wool factories.
Some individuals show remarkable resistance to this route of infection.
When clinical infection does become established, it is acute and severe,
with the development of hemorrhages and edema involving both lungs, and,
the local lymph glands. Septicemia may develop."
Mongolia suffers a steady stream of anthrax outbreaks each year. Proactive
area vaccination should be considered in those parts with repeated
outbreaks. Reactive vaccination of exposed livestock buys only a modest
number of months before new cases appear, as vaccination is not continued.
This scenario has been played out already in Alberta, Saskatchewan and
Manitoba. It is wiser to do as the Cypriots did in their successful
eradication program: define those regions with an ongoing problem,
vaccinate each herd and flock each year, just before the summer "anthrax
season," for at least 5 years, and use repeated annual vaccination just in
those areas/farms where cases continue to appear. Combined with prompt
reporting of all cases, and proper disposal [burning] of carcasses, this
eradication program works. - Mod.MHJ]
