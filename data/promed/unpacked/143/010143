[Please note that publications presented in these updates that come from bioRxiv are pre-peer review manuscripts, and final publications may be significantly different.

Also, it is clear that the number of reported confirmed cases differs from different reporting websites and is somewhat a function of time of day the website is updated. For example, I note the time I've accessed the Johns Hopkins' website, but by the time the post is actually finished with the editing process, those numbers have at times significantly changed. Case counting is clearly a moving target and, depending upon when the website updates, the numbers may be different. - Mod.MPP]

[3] Selected media reports of transmission outside of mainland China
A. Japanese cruise ship, USA citizens airlifted 16 Feb 2020
Date: Sun 16 Feb 2020
Source: NY Times [edited]
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/16/world/asia/china-coronavirus.html


Flights carrying American passengers from a cruise ship took off from Japan.
---------------------------------------------
American passengers evacuated a cruise ship that has been quarantined for more than a week in the Japanese port city of Yokohama, after hundreds of people on board fell ill with the coronavirus. The Americans boarded 2 chartered flights to the United States, which departed Tokyo at 7:05 a.m. [local time] Monday [17 Feb 2020], according to a statement by the United States Embassy in Japan.

As the passengers prepared to leave the country, Japanese health officials said the number of confirmed coronavirus cases found on the ship, the Diamond Princess, had grown by 70, to 355.

When the ship was placed under quarantine, there were more than 3700 passengers and crew aboard, including about 400 Americans. The U.S. Embassy in Japan had previously recommended that American citizens stay aboard the ship during a 14-day quarantine period. But it changed course on Saturday [15 Feb 2020], citing "a rapidly evolving situation" as conditions appeared to worsen.

Only American passengers who were screened and did not show any symptoms of the illness were allowed to board the flights, according to a statement from the State Department. "All travelers on these flights were screened for symptoms prior to departure and will be subject to Centers for Disease Control (CDC) screening, health observation, and monitoring requirements," the statement said. "Only those who were asymptomatic were allowed to board the flights."

Once in the United States, passengers will undergo a 14-day quarantine at either Travis Air Force Base in Fairfield, Calif., or Lackland Air Force Base near San Antonio. The embassy said that those who did not take the charter flights would not be allowed to travel to the United States until [4 Mar 2020], 2 weeks after they would otherwise be allowed to leave the ship.

U.S. bases brace for American evacuees.
------------------------------
The United States Department of Defense said it was preparing to receive the 2 evacuation flights carrying American passengers from the Diamond Princess, docked in Japan. The passengers will have to undergo a 14-day quarantine, as mandated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Lt. Col. Chris Mitchell, a Defense Department spokesman, said on Sunday [16 Feb 2020].

The Department of Health and Human Services' goal is to ensure that none of those who are evacuated are transferred to the bases -- Travis Air Force Base in California, and Kelly Field/Lackland Air Force Base in Texas -- if they test positive for the virus. Evacuees who do, or who show symptoms of the virus, will be taken "to a suitable off-base facility at the direction of C.D.C.," he said.

[The end of one saga and the beginning of a new saga. Will all evacuees undergo testing for the coronavirus, even in the absence of symptoms? This is a learning curve with only 11 weeks of experience with this coronavirus that is behaving like a mosaic of the other known coronaviruses; clinical spectrum runs from apparently totally asymptomatic to mild common cold-like symptoms to severe primary viral pneumonia or generalized sepsis and multiorgan failure, and epidemiologically is beginning to behave like influenza, but the full picture still awaits definition. - Mod.MPP]

Virus Outbreak: CECC reports 1st coronavirus death
------------------------------------------
The Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) yesterday [14 Feb 2020] announced 2 new confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection in Taiwan, 1 of whom died on Saturday [15 Feb 2020].

"One of the cases was a 61-year-old man who had chronic hepatitis B and diabetes but had not visited other countries or had close contact with a confirmed case of COVID-19," Minister of Health and Welfare Chen Shih-chung, head of the center, told a news conference in Taipei.

The man developed a cough on [27 Jan 2020], sought treatment for difficulty breathing on [3 Feb 2020] and was diagnosed with pneumonia and hospitalized in a negative pressure intensive care unit, Chen said, adding that he died of pneumonia and sepsis. "With the consent of his family members, specimens were collected for testing before his body was cremated according to regulations on notifiable communicable diseases," he said.

The CECC said that the man -- who became the nation's 19th confirmed COVID-19 case -- was from central Taiwan, adding that it is investigating where he had been and might announce the location of his residence if necessary.

The 2nd new case is a male relative of the 19th case in his 50s, who tested positive for COVID-19 on Saturday [15 Feb 2020] and is asymptomatic, Chen said.

Before [7 Feb 2020], mandatory reporting of suspected cases required that people show symptoms and had visited China, so the man was not reported for COVID-19 testing, he said. The center on Wednesday [12 Feb 2020] began to trace all cases of serious flu complications that tested positive for the flu as reported by hospitals since [31 Jan 2020], Chen said. As of Saturday [15 Feb 2020], specimens from 113 such cases were tested for the new virus, and only the 19th confirmed case returned positive results, Chen said

The deceased man can be considered a case of "community-acquired infection," as he did not visit other countries but was an independent taxi driver who had many passengers that had traveled to China, Hong Kong or Macau, he said.

The CECC has launched an investigation into his communication records and National Health Insurance (NHI) records as well as surveillance camera footage in a bid to find everyone who might have come into contact with the man and track the possible source of infection as soon as possible, Chen said. Of 79 people found so far who came into contact with the man, 73 have been tested, which resulted in 60 negative results and 1 positive result -- the 20th confirmed case -- while the others are awaiting test results, he said.

Centers for Disease Control Deputy Director-General Chuang Jen-hsiang said that a community surveillance program was launched yesterday [15 Feb 2020], allowing 3 types of people to be tested for COVID-19. They include people who have visited other countries in the past 14 days or have been exposed to people from other countries who experience a fever or respiratory symptoms, as well as those doctors suspect might to be infected with COVID-19. They also include cluster cases that experience a fever or respiratory symptoms, pneumonia cases involving "an unknown pathogen and unrelieved symptoms after 3 days of antibiotic treatment," "clustered cases" or "medical professionals."

The NHI Administration announced that people who have visited or transited in China, Hong Kong, Macau, Singapore and Thailand in the past 30 days would be marked in the NHI system, allowing doctors to know their travel history when they seek medical attention.

[This is now the 4th fatality reported associated with infection with the virus causing COVID-19 outside of Mainland China. Other fatalities have been reported in Hong Kong, the Philippines, France and now Taiwan.

Community acquired cases are being identified in several countries outside of Mainland China: Singapore, South Korea, Japan, Thailand and now Taiwan. It's noteworthy that taxi drivers have been the sentinel cases for community transmission in Japan and now Taiwan. Passengers in taxis most likely had travel histories to areas with known transmission of the virus. This case would have been missed if Taiwan had not changed surveillance and testing criteria. According to media reports, a number of countries are changing testing criteria recognizing this virus may be circulating under the radarscope, remembering that 4 of the coronaviruses known to infect humans are responsible for the common cold, and this coronavirus, associated with COVID-19, has a clinical spectrum that includes a common cold-like presentation. - Mod.MPP]

South Korea reported another confirmed case of the new coronavirus Sunday [16 Feb 2020], involving an 82-year-old man with no record of overseas travel, bringing the total to 29 after a 5-day lull in new cases. The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) said the new patient tested positive for the virus after visiting Korea University Anam Hospital in Seoul with a heart problem and is currently quarantined at Seoul National University Hospital in Seoul, one of the facilities designated by the state for the treatment of the virus.

The patient, who is in a stable condition, was found to have visited 2 other medical clinics before visiting the university hospital, officials said, adding that quarantine and disinfecting efforts are underway for the clinics. The KCDC said he didn't go to a separate screening clinic for the virus since he had no symptoms of fever or respiratory problems upon his visit to the Anam hospital's emergency room. However, doctors there ran the coronavirus test after finding out that he had pneumonia.

The emergency room of the Korea University hospital is currently closed, according to the KCDC.

Common symptoms of the coronavirus include fever, sore throat and breathing difficulties, with more acute cases involving chills and muscle pain and severe cases developing into pneumonia. The KCDC said the government is considering running coronavirus tests on some pneumonia patients hospitalized across the country in the coming days. The KCDC believes that the latest patient, who is also the country's oldest individual to be infected by the virus, had no contact with the country's other virus-confirmed patients at this moment, adding that health authorities are still investigating where and when he contracted the virus.

This is South Korea's 1st novel coronavirus case since Tuesday [11 Feb 2020], when the country reported its 28th COVID-19 infection after a 30-year-old Chinese woman tested positive for the virus on Monday [10 Feb 2020]. The number of people being checked for the virus under quarantine came to 485 as of late Sunday [16 Feb 2020], the KCDC said in a statement.

South Korea has tested a total of 8132 people for the virus since [3 Jan 2020], with 7647 testing negative. The country has so far decided to release 9 patients who have recovered from the virus from quarantine, with 8 of them already discharged from their hospitals. The KCDC said the 20 patients currently being treated for the virus at hospitals are in a stable condition, although one is receiving oxygen therapy for pneumonia but is not in a severe condition, it added.

Among the 28 cases -- 15 men and 13 women -- that were confirmed as of Saturday [15 Feb 2020], 16 contracted the virus outside South Korea, according to KCDC, while 10 did so here. Health authorities are currently investigating the transmission routes of 2 cases. Of the 28 patients, 22 were South Koreans, with the rest being Chinese nationals. 18 were found to have symptoms of pneumonia after they were hospitalized. By age, 8 of them were in their 50s.

There have been no cases of human-to-human transmission from asymptomatic patients, according to KCDC, adding that the virus's average incubation period for domestically infected patients was 4.1 days.

Jung Eun-kyeong, head of KCDC, said the country now has to focus on preventing the spread of the coronavirus at medical institutions and in regional communities. "Coronavirus can spread fast even though an infected person has mild symptoms," Jung said. "There is still a possibility that the virus can spread widely from medical institutions where there are many elderly and sick patients."

South Korea started enforcing strict quarantine screening against entrants from Hong Kong and Macao, in addition to mainland China, on Wednesday [12 Feb 2020]. Passengers from mainland China, Hong Kong and Macao are now required to use separate arrival counters at international airports across the country and must write a special quarantine report, filling out a health questionnaire to check whether they have a fever or respiratory problems.

Earlier in the day, the government released the 2nd group of 334 South Koreans it evacuated from Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak, following a 2-week quarantine after they had all tested negative for the novel coronavirus.

The evacuees were airlifted out of the central Chinese city of Wuhan on South Korea's 2nd special chartered flight and arrived in the country on [1 Feb 2020]. The 1st group of 366 evacuees, who arrived in South Korea on [31 Jan 2020], were released from quarantine and returned home on Saturday [15 Feb 2020].

[The history of visiting 2 other health facilities prior to diagnosis is very reminiscent of the history of the MERS-CoV outbreak in South Korea in 2015. Given this patient's history of no travel and no known contact with other COVID-19 cases, it's a perfect storm for community based transmission and hospital-based transmission. Time will tell. What is curious about the described history of this case is that he had no symptoms, yet pneumonia was diagnosed. Was a history of dyspnea attributed to cardiac failure?

Of note is a recent tweet from KBS News mentioning that a 30th case has also been confirmed, the wife of the 29th patient; https://news.sbs.co.kr/news/endPage.do?news_id=N1005651805&plink=TWITTER&cooper=PUSH. - Mod.MPP]

*The situation report includes information provided by national authorities as of 10 a.m. CET.

Highlights
----------
- No new countries reported cases of COVID-19 in the past 24 hours.

- A 3rd death of a COVID-19 patient has been reported outside of China. This individual was a tourist from China visiting France.

- Studies to assess the epidemiology and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 cases in different settings are, therefore, critical to furthering our understanding of this virus and associated disease. Several early investigation master protocols or master forms are available for countries to use. More information can be found at: https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/early-investigations.

Technical Focus: Early Epidemiologic and Clinical investigations
The recent emergence of COVID-19 means that understanding of transmission patterns, severity, clinical features and risk factors for infection remains limited, whether about the general population, health workers or in household and other "closed" settings. Studies to assess the epidemiology and clinical characteristics of cases in different settings are, therefore, critical to furthering our understanding of this virus and associated disease. They will also provide the robust information needed to feed forecasting models.

Several early investigation master protocols or master forms are available for countries:

1. FFX (First Few X number of cases and their close contacts) transmission protocol: case and close contact tracing in the general population. Contact: <earlyinvestigations-2019-nCoV@who.int>.

FFX is the primary investigation protocol to be initiated upon identification of the initial laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 in a country.

For a more targeted approach on specific groups and more precise estimation of epidemiological parameters, 3 other investigation protocols are available:

2. Household (HH) transmission study protocol. Contact: <earlyinvestigations-2019-nCoV@who.int>.

3. Risk factors assessment for Health Workers (HCW) protocol. Contact: <earlyinvestigations-2019- nCoV@who.int>.

4. Environmental sampling protocol (in development)

5. Global COVID-19 Clinical Characterization Case Record Form: a standard approach to collect clinical data of hospitalized patients is necessary to better understand clinical characteristics of the disease and treatment interventions. Anonymized clinical data and information related to patients with suspected or confirmed infections can be shared. Contact: <EDCARN@who.int> for log-in details.

To support country implementation of the 1st 2 protocols (FFX, HH), it is recommended to use the Go.Data field electronic tool for case and contacts data collection and management. The FFX and HH protocol questionnaire templates are available in Go.Data. Visit http://www.who.int/godata or contact <godata@who.int> for more information.

These protocols and forms have been designed so that data can be rapidly and systematically collected and shared in a format that facilitates aggregation, tabulation and analysis across different settings globally. We encourage any and all countries and study centres to contribute to this effort regardless of resource availability or patient volume. The ownership of the primary data remains firmly with the individual countries/sites.

Data collected using these investigation protocols will be critical to refine recommendations for case definitions and surveillance, characterize key epidemiological features of COVID-19, help understand spread, severity, spectrum of disease, and impact on the community and to inform guidance for application of countermeasures such as case isolation and contact tracing. More information can be found at this webpage.

*Case classifications are based on WHO case definitions for COVID-19.
**Location of transmission is classified based on WHO analysis of available official data and may be subject to reclassification as additional data become available.
***The exposure for 3 cases occurred outside of Republic of Korea.
****The exposure for 1 case occurred outside of Malaysia. One patient also had travel history to China, but exposure likely occurred after return to Malaysia.
*****The exposure for 6 cases occurred outside of the United Kingdom.
******The exposure for 2 cases occurred outside of Spain.
*******Cases identified on a cruise ship currently in Japanese territorial waters.

[The number of countries reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 with transmission occurring outside China is now 14 (Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Viet Nam, Malaysia, Australia, Thailand, USA, France, Germany, Spain, UK, UAE, and Egypt). There has also been local transmission noted on the cruise ship quarantined in Japan related to a quarantine officer.

New confirmatory information contained in this update includes showing the number of laboratory-confirmed cases in China in addition to showing the clinically confirmed cases, in keeping with change in reporting criteria implemented in Hubei province. Thus, while the numbers of "confirmed cases" in China yesterday [15 Feb 2020] increased by an additional 2008 (16 Feb 2020: 68 584; 15 Feb 2020: 66 576), the number of laboratory-confirmed cases increased by 1120 from that reported in the WHO update on 15 Feb 2020 (16 Feb 2020 51 174; 15 Feb 2020: 50 054). It is too soon to definitively state this, but it does appear as though there may be a trend for decreasing numbers of newly confirmed cases. Time will tell. Unfortunately, there isn't a delineation of fatalities to know how many of the newly reported fatalities were laboratory-confirmed cases. - Mod.MPP]
