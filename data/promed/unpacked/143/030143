Members of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are
continuing to offer assistance with an investigation into the area's
salmonella outbreak. State health officials are now reporting 56 confirmed
cases of salmonellosis in the greater Sierra Vista area since 1 Sep 2007.
The local outbreak involves _Salmonella enterica_ serotype Oranienburg. A
4-member CDC team arrived in mid-January 2007 to assist local health
officials in the investigation, hoping to identify a commonality among the
different cases that could lead to a source.
After interviewing people who were affected by the infection, along with
those who came in contact with those people, health officials were still
looking for answers. A random phone survey is the next stage in the search,
something that will continue through the 1st week of March 2007.
The study involves an interview of several questions including eating
habits within and outside of the home during certain time periods. The
questions also set up common patterns, such as attendance of any public
events or behavioral patterns that might indicate contact with previously
infected people.

[This cluster of _S._ Oranienburg has been occurring slowly over a 6-month
period, similar to the also still ongoing _S._ Tennessee peanut
butter-associated outbreak. A vehicle has not yet been determined, but the
time span of the outbreak suggests a vehicle with a long shelf life rather
than fresh produce or fresh or frozen meat.
Sierra Vista, Arizona is located 70 miles south east of Tucson in Cochise
County. The county can be found on a map of the state at
