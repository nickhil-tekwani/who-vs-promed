[Classical swine fever-free countries have to be almost as worried about
that disease (CSF), also known as hog cholera, as they do FMD. Haiti and
Dominican Republic were infected with CSF in 1997. Unless stamped out
quickly, this is a significant threat to Cuba. Cuba is very close to the
United States, but it is fortunate from an epidemiological standpoint that
there is not much trade or traffic between the two countries. - Mod.PC]
