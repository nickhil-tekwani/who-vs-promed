The number of people possibly exposed to a rabid raccoon has more than
doubled from the number originally reported last week, state officials said
on Tuesday [13 May 2008]. The South Carolina Department of Health and
Environmental Control (DHEC) also revealed that the raccoon originally was
adopted by Okatie residents visiting Wexford Plantation on Hilton Head
Island. Last week, DHEC would only say that the animal was found on Hilton
Head. The state agency has now evaluated 33 Okatie and Georgia residents
for possible exposure to the rabid animal, said DHEC spokeswoman Clair
Boatwright.

Initially, 16 people had come in contact with the animal through kissing,
holding, and feeding it by putting their fingers in its mouth, DHEC said.
Now, 24 are getting vaccinated to prevent them from contracting rabies,
DHEC said on Tuesday [13 May 2008]. The other 9 were exposed to the raccoon
but did not need treatment. Boatwright said those 9 did not touch the
animal but were part of the investigation.

Boatwright said 17 pets belonging to the exposed humans are under
quarantine for 45 days. [According to South Carolina rabies laws, these
animals must have been vaccinated if they are under quarantine for 45 days.

The people who found the raccoon in the woods at Wexford passed it around
to many of their friends and relatives, Boatwright said. "They found it,
took it to somebody else who kept it for a few days, and thought someone
else would want it," she said. "It was the pass-around-pack for a while
from what we understand."

Chuck Chapman, chief of security at Wexford, said he has not gotten any
recent reports about rabid animals or the baby raccoon found in the
plantation. "We get calls periodically from people involving animals,
whether alligators or what appear to be sick or angry animals like stray
dogs," Chapman said. "We never get a call from somebody who says, 'hey, I
picked up a raccoon in the woods and I'm taking it home.'"

Chapman said if wild animals are sick or causing problems in the
plantation, he contacts Critter Management to remove the animal. He would
also call DHEC if the animal had bitten a resident. DHEC urges everyone to
avoid touching or adopting a wild animal and to report any bites from
potentially rabid animals. "You just cannot tell from looking at it whether
it's diseased or not," Boatwright said.

The raccoon began having seizures last week; it was euthanized and its body
was sent to DHEC. The agency confirmed it tested positive for rabies. This
is the 1st confirmed rabid animal in Beaufort County for 2008. Last year
[2007], there were 162 confirmed cases of rabid animals across the state;
none was in Beaufort County.

Many people wince at the thought of human rabies vaccines, because they
recall an older form -- made from duck embryos -- that required 21 shots,
many given in the abdomen. Now, the vaccine is made from the rabies virus,
but it cannot cause the disease. Post exposure treatment includes a series
of 5 shots in the shoulder or forearm, along with one shot in the buttocks
and extra shots around the bite -- the number depends on the size of the bite.

The series of shots costs about USD 1000 per person and is being paid for
by the SC Department of Health and Environmental Control, which is funded
by taxpayers.

[Human rabies immune globulin (HRIG) is administered only once, at the
beginning of anti-rabies prophylaxis, to previously unvaccinated persons to
provide immediate antibodies until they respond to the vaccine by actively
producing antibodies of their own. If anatomically feasible, the full dose
of HRIG should be thoroughly infiltrated in the area around and into the
wounds. Any remaining volume should be injected intramuscularly at a site
distant from vaccine administration.

HRIG should never be administered in the same syringe or in the same
anatomical site as the 1st vaccine dose. However, subsequent doses of
vaccine in the 5-dose series can be administered in the same anatomic
location where the HRIG dose was administered.

If HRIG was not administered when vaccination was begun, it can be
administered up to 7 days after the administration of the 1st dose of
vaccine. Beyond the 7th day, HRIG is not recommended since an antibody
response to the vaccine is presumed to have occurred.

Because HRIG can partially suppress active production of antibody, no more
than the recommended dose should be administered. The recommended dose of
HRIG is 20 IU/kg body weight. This formula is applicable to all age groups,
including children.

A regimen of 5 1-mL doses of HDCV or PCEC vaccines should be administered
intramuscularly to previously unvaccinated persons.

The 1st dose of the 5-dose course should be administered as soon as
possible after exposure. Additional doses should be administered on days 3,
7, 14, and 28 after the 1st vaccination. For adults, the vaccination should
always be administered intramuscularly in the deltoid area (arm). For
children, the anterolateral aspect of the thigh is also acceptable. The
gluteal area should never be used for rabies vaccine injections because
observations suggest administration in this area results in lower
neutralizing antibody titers. Extracted from
