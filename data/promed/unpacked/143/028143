Mysterious Epidemic Claims 580 Lives In Sudan Province
March 1 - A mysterious epidemic is spreading like a wild fire, claiming
hundreds of lives in southern Sudan's Lake Province and Yirol County.
The newly appointed Catholic Bishop of the Diocese of Rumbek, Monsignor
Ceasar Mazzolari said here last week that the epidemic was first reported
in December last year but so far there has been no international
intervention to bring it under control.
Bishop Mazzolari was speaking on arrival from an extensive tour of the
war-torn expansive state. The symptoms of the killer-disease, said the
Comboni missionary, are headache, diarrhoea and intestinal complications,
which in the eyes of a layman, may appear like malaria.
"It is highly contagious epidemic and kills its victim within 24 hours,"
said Mazzolari, pointing out that during January, the epidemic claimed 580
lives.
"The figure could be much higher because the above cases were only in the
central areas accessible to our personnel," he said.
The situation is distressing as the disease is spreading fast in the
extremely harsh climatic conditions, the bishop said, adding that lack of
water had complicated matters.
Bishop Mazzolari identified the worst hit areas as Rumbek, Cuibet, Tonj,
Thiet, Yirol, Agangrial, and Wulu, an area of about 45,000 square
kilometres.
He said the diocese health coordinator, Dr. Brigitte Bayer of Malterser (a
German NGO), had already notified his counterpart at the Sudan Relief and
Rehabilitation Association (SRRA) Dr. Valerio Ahou about the situation. I
believe they have proceeded to inform UNICEF though there has been no
response so far," he said.
Bishop Mazzolari together with the Sudanese People's Liberation Army (SPLA)
Commissioner of Rumbek, Paul Mayom and SPLA health coordinator Dr. Samuel
Mayak appealed for immediate intervention to help avert the crisis.
"My office is ready and willing to give any support within our means to any
organization or individual willing to help fight the epidemic," Mazzolari
said.
