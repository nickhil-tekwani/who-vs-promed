Health officials have found dengue mosquitoes [_Aedes aegypti_] in the Northern Territory outback after they likely hitched a ride from tropical north Queensland. The female _Aedes aegypti_ -- also known as the yellow fever mosquito -- is the only insect that can spread dengue fever [not true. _Aedes albopictus_, the Asian tiger mosquito, can also transmit dengue viruses. - Mod.TY]

During routine exotic mosquito surveillance in Tennant Creek, about 1000 km [620 mi] south of Darwin, 3 females and one male were trapped by medical entomology officers.

No cases of dengue fever have been diagnosed and the virus is not present in the Territory, NT Health says.

It's likely the mosquitoes were accidentally brought from Queensland by road, medical entomologist Bill Pettit said on [Tue 9 Mar 2021]. 'The dengue mosquito was eliminated from the NT in the mid-1950s and has not become permanently established since,' he said. However, it did make it back into the Territory on 3 occasions -- Tennant Creek in 2004 and 2011, and on Groote Eylandt in 2006 -- requiring 'a comprehensive 2 year program' to eliminate the insect.

Health officers will travel to Tennant Creek this month to search for more dengue mosquitoes and larvae.

The insect is often found around homes and typically lay their eggs in water-filled containers such as buckets, animal dishes and flower pots. The eggs can survive in the dry for up 12 months and follow-up visits are likely to be required after the next rains to ensure the mosquito is eliminated. Tennant Creek residents have been urged to tip out any water from containers around their homes until their properties have been inspected.

Dengue fever is usually found in tropical and subtropical countries in Africa, Asia, and South America. An outbreak also occurs in North Queensland each year. Symptoms are high fever, a rash, and muscle and joint pain. In severe cases, there is serious bleeding and shock, which can be life-threatening.

[This discovery of _Aedes aegypti_ in the Northern Territory (NT) after a long absence illustrates the ease with which this mosquito can be moved through human activity. NT health authorities are prudent to respond aggressively and eliminate this mosquito while its numbers are small and its location is limited. This mosquito is established in northern Queensland and transmits dengue viruses there -- something to be avoided in dengue-free NT. - Mod.TY
