Greetings from Guyana
Re: posting concerning Yellow Fever in Brazil and concerns about action by
Guyana posted by Dr Claudio Henries [ref. above:
I have contacted the ministry of health Guyana (Chief Medical Officer) and
he responded that activities to confront the actual situation in the
frontier areas have been commenced by the Guyana Ministry of Health.
I have permission to post the reply of the Chief Medical officer for
information. The reply to my inquiries was as follows:
>>>>>>>>>
Dear Lloyd,
Thanks for your letter dated October 28th. I received the day before
an indication of ProMED-mail's interest in the Brazil yellow fever
situation. Two weeks ago we had a planning meeting as a result of
which the following is in place.
Vaccination has started simultaneously in the Upper Mazaruni, North
Pakariamas and Rupununi. We are dispatching a contingent of Health
Educators to the Rupununi today [29 Oct 1998 (after I heard on
Tuesday of the Boa Vista cases). We are also circulating some
epidemiological definitions for communities and health workers in
all the at risk regions. We shall start border surveillance as of
Monday at the Lethem crossing for yellow fever vaccination. Those
are our plans. We are issuing a press statement today to advise on
these measures. I shall send you a hard copy of the plan...

Sincerely yours,
Dr. Rudolph O. Cummings
Chief Medical Officer (ag.)
