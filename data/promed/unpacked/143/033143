[This is the 2nd part of the daily update following the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, with a focus on selected countries of interest. To reduce the size of these posts, there will be changes over the coming days. The tables will be reduced but are available at the source URLs and will be referred to in the summaries of daily changes for each country. Countries that have almost interrupted transmission and have been lifting restrictions (China, South Korea) and have lessons to learn as they attempt to prevent explosive 2nd waves will continue to be profiled. We will attempt to select countries from each region on a daily basis. - Mod.MPP]

[According to the report above, in the past 24 hours, there have been 7 newly confirmed cases in China, 6 of whom were imported. No new deaths were reported. Also, no new cases were reported in Hong Kong or in Macau. A total of 1803 imported cases have been reported. There have been no new deaths reported for several weeks, further supporting a reduced level of cases in the country.

There was 1 newly confirmed infection in an asymptomatic individual in the past 24 hours -- imported. There was 1 case of conversion from asymptomatic to symptomatic in the past 24 hours. The recent previous reports of a conversion from asymptomatic to symptomatic were on 4, 6, 8, 9, 10 Jun 2020 when 1 conversion was reported each time. Prior to that, there were 2 cases on 1 Jun 2020, and a single case was reported on 18 May 2020 (COVID-19 update (194): China, S Korea, countries w/ high local trans, Italy phase 2 20200519.7352327).

Recurrent questions: What is the total number of asymptomatic cases? What is the total number of asymptomatic cases that converted to symptomatic? What is the proportion of asymptomatic imported cases that have been linked to transmission chains resulting in outbreak clusters?

[In the past 24 hours, the tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea has increased by 56 cases and 1 new death, compared with 45 cases and no new deaths in the previous day (10 Jun 2020). The daily newly confirmed case count has been at or below 100 for 67 consecutive days. Today's (11 Jun 2020) breakdown of cases: 43 cases were locally transmitted, and 13 were imported cases. Locally acquired cases were in Gyeonggi (18), Seoul (24), and Daegu (1). Imported cases were in Seoul (1), Incheon (1), Gyeonggi (1), and Quarantine (10). Note that 13 provinces did not report any newly confirmed cases.

The impression (hasn't changed): lifting of measures has been accompanied by increases in locally acquired infections through increasing clusters related to gatherings of people at employment (bringing it outside employment to contacts) and in houses of worship, and bars and clubs. It just takes one super spreader in a crowded place to transmit and lead to a sizeable cluster.

[The tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy is now 236 142 cases, including 34 167 deaths, up by 379 cases and 53 deaths in the past 24 hours. The previous day's (10 Jun 2020) 24-hour change was 202 cases and 71 deaths. The numbers of hospitalized cases and cases in the ICU are still in decline. As it has been, the major increase in cases was in Lombardy, reporting 252 newly confirmed cases.

Cases still continue to be concentrated in Lombardy, the original epicenter of the outbreak, Emilia-Romagna, Lazio, Piedmont, and Liguria (see tables at http://www.salute.gov.it/imgs/C_17_notizie_4881_0_file.pdf and http://www.salute.gov.it/imgs/C_17_notizie_4881_1_file.pdf). These 5 provinces combined today (11 Jun 2020) account for 92.1% of reported newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. Lombardy again reported the largest number of newly confirmed cases in the 24-hour period (252) and was the only province reporting more than 50 new cases. Also, 15 provinces reported fewer than 10 newly confirmed cases (4 provinces reported no new cases), with another 5 provinces reporting fewer than 50 newly confirmed cases, are these early signs of increased local transmission following lifting of restrictions....so far hospitalizations and ICU beds are dropping in use, but how much increase in local transmission is necessary to start seeing more hospitalizations and ICU admissions? Remembering that the reported cases and deaths probably represent 1 in 10 to 1 in 20 of true infections in the community.

The top 5 provinces by cumulative case count remain unchanged and are Lombardy, followed by Piedmont, Emilia-Romagna, Veneto, and Tuscany. The top 5 provinces by number of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours are Lombardy (252), followed by Piedmont (42), Emilia-Romagna (25), Lazio (20), and Liguria and Tuscany, both with 10 cases each.

Italy is now 38 days post phase 2 initial opening up and 22 days post 2nd stage of phase 2 opening up.

[4] Iran: 180 156 total cases, 8584 deaths

Iran registered 2238 coronavirus cases in the past 24 hours, taking the total to 180 156, Health Ministry Spokeswoman Sima Sadat Lari said on Thursday [11 Jun 2020], adding that about 142 700 patients have recovered since the beginning of the outbreak.

According to the spokeswoman, as broadcast by the IRINN channel, 78 people have died from the coronavirus complications in the preceding 24 hours, taking the cumulative death toll to 8584. The number of new infections in Iran continues to stabilize after last week's record spike of 3574 cases. Since then, the country has been reporting less than 3000 cases a day.

Iranian authorities have explained the spike by more aggressive testing. According to the ministry, the country now conducts up to 25 000 tests daily.

[As of 11 Jun 2020, the total number of cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Iran is 180 156, including 8584 deaths, an increase of 2218 new cases and 78 deaths since 10 Jun 2020.

Iran has started relaxing restrictions on a more widespread basis in the country. With the increasing daily case reports having surpassed the prior peak in late March-early April 2020, it is clear that there is now a 2nd wave, most likely due to too early lifting of restrictions. The key concern will be whether people begin travelling again within the country and may transport the virus from one zone to another. So far, it appears as although the daily case counts are decreasing and may reflect the impact of tightened control measures in affected provinces.

[The above are the latest breakdowns of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the USA as per Worldometer data. The total number of confirmed cases in the USA and territories is now 2 089 701, including 116 034 deaths, an increase from 2 066 401 cases and 115 130 deaths in the past 24 hours. New York City had a cumulative total of 205 405 as of 13:00 EDT (GMT-4) on 11 Jun 2020 including 17 300 confirmed deaths and an additional 4693 probable deaths (https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data.page).

The top 10 states in terms of daily reported cases in descending order are California, Texas, Florida, Arizona, North Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Illinois, Maryland, and New York. Alabama is new to this list and is worth watching.

In terms of cumulative case reports, New York is number one, followed by New Jersey, California, Illinois, Massachusetts, Texas (surpassing Pennsylvania in the past 24 hours), Pennsylvania, Florida, Michigan, and Maryland, the same 10 states as yesterday as previously. A total of 38 states and entities have reported more than 10 000 cumulative cases each.
