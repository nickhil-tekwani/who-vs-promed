The previous posting contained the statement "Germany reported five - the
expected number was 243." and a moderator [pc] commented "Congratulations
to the Swiss on accurate and thorough BSE surveillance. For the others,
what they don't look for, doesn't exist.
I cannot let this stand without commentary. We do look for BSE. To be more
precise: Cows with signs of CNS disturbance that are admitted to our clinic
(which basically services southern Bavaria, an area with intensive
dairying) are either clinically cured (a highly unlikely event in cows with
BSE), or they go to necropsy which includes brain histology. Our faculty
includes a full professor for neuropathology.
The brains of all cows with a history of CNS disturbance that are sent to
Veterinary Investigations Centers for necropsy are specifically examined
for BSE.
There have been many continuing education presentations for practitioners
on BSE. Prof. U. Braun from Zurich, who has examined a good share of the
Swiss BSE cases, has been in high demand to show his impressive videos. I
see no reason to believe that veterinary practitioners are intentionally
holding back cows with signs of CNS involvement, nor do I see a reason to
believe that there is a policy to cover up.
I would appreciate if that last remark in the original posting (cited
above) was taken back.
[I'm sorry if I ruffled any feathers with my statement. I intended to point
out the time honored principle that surveillance systems only revealed
those disease they are designed to monitor. I probably should have
suggested that those diseases that are effectively looked for are seen.
However, I did not find in Wolfgang's reply, a real answer as to why the
Swiss are finding so many BSE cows and no one else is. Furthermore,
tertiary care centers are notoriously poor perches for surveillance. So
while Dr. Klee may be looking very carefully at what comes into his clinic,
this is not enough to ensure effective surveillance of the dairy cattle
population. I do not know what measures are in place to ensure population
based surveillance in Bavaria but I would be interested in a detailed
comparision concerning what the Swiss are doing and what others are doing
in terms of population based surveillance.
I am really sorry if anyone took my statement to mean than anything more
than an assertion that effective surveillance systems are a necessity for
accurate disease prevalence estimation and this may explain the
discrepancy between expected and observed case numbers for BSE in Europe. -

In a time when beef-exporting countries in southern Africa are coming under
increasing pressure from EU countries to prove their freedom from BSE, the
item on BSE under-reporting by these same countries makes revealing
reading. I heard a rumour recently of so-called "bulldozer disease" in
France - when cattle show nervous signs, farmers apparently use bulldozers
to bury them for fear BSE might be diagnosed. Can this be true?

>The report calculates that of the 55,400 British cattle exported to other

>would have contracted BSE after export. However, only 285 cases were
reported.
Actually, of course, it's very much worse than this. A considerable
number of live finished cattle were also exported in that period. I
don't have the figures to hand but I am confident the number was very
many times the number for breeding cattle. One presumes their remains
were made into MBM which was fed on the continent (as occurred in the
UK) but this MBM seems to have been strangely uninfectious.
>In Germany - where the campaign against buying British beef has been

>times less than expected.
This was utterly predictable (in all EU countries, not just Germany) due to
the unscientific [herd depopulation is a well recognized disease control
option, so why is it unscientific - mod pc] practice of slaughtering whole
herds where a case was found (in the case of Germany, whole breeds). Not
only does this have a negligeable effect on reducing new cases, it pretty
well ensures that a farmer will endevour to conceal cases. This was
predicted by SEAC and even by the UK members of parliament (well known for
their towering intellect) at the very start of the epidemic in the UK.
