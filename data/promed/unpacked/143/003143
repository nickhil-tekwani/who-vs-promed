Abstract
--------
Background
Widespread ceftriaxone antimicrobial resistance (AMR) threatens _Neisseria gonorrhoeae_ (NG) treatment, with few alternatives available. AMR point-of-care tests (AMR POCT) may enable alternative treatments, including abandoned regimens, sparing ceftriaxone use. We assessed cost-effectiveness of 5 hypothetical AMR POCT strategies: A-C included a 2nd antibiotic alongside ceftriaxone; D and E consisted of a single antibiotic alternative, compared with standard care (SC: ceftriaxone and azithromycin).

Aim
Assess costs and effectiveness of AMR POCT strategies that optimise NG treatment and reduce ceftriaxone use.

Methods
The 5 AMR POCT treatment strategies were compared using a decision tree model simulating 38 870 NG-diagnosed England sexual health clinic (SHC) attendees; a micro-costing approach, representing cost to the SHC (for 2015/16), was employed. Primary outcomes were total costs; percentage of patients given optimal treatment (regimens curing NG, without AMR); percentage of patients given non-ceftriaxone optimal treatment; cost-effectiveness (cost per optimal treatment gained).

Results
All strategies cost more than SC. Strategy B (azithromycin and ciprofloxacin [azithromycin preferred]; dual therapy) avoided most suboptimal treatments (n = 48) but cost most to implement (GBP 4 093 844 [EUR 5 474 656, USD 6 393 024]). Strategy D (azithromycin AMR POCT; monotherapy) was most cost-effective for both cost per optimal treatments gained (GBP 414.67 [EUR 554.53, USD 647.55]) and per ceftriaxone-sparing treatment (GBP 11.29 [EUR 15.09, USD 17.62]) but with treatment failures (n = 34) and suboptimal treatments (n = 706).

Conclusions
AMR POCT may enable improved antibiotic stewardship but require net health system investment. A small reduction in test cost would enable monotherapy AMR POCT strategies to be cost-saving.

[Multidrug-resistant _Neisseria gonorrhoeae_ is a top threat to public health. The currently recommended -- and last remaining antimicrobial -- regimen is ceftriaxone combined with azithromycin (referred to as standard care in the reference journal article) (https://www.cdc.gov/std/tg2015/gonorrhea.htm). Azithromycin is combined with ceftriaxone in this regimen to potentially slow the emergence of resistance to ceftriaxone and to presumptively treat concomitant chlamydia infection.

A proposed strategy to reduce the selective pressure for emergence of resistance to ceftriaxone has been targeted use of antibiotics that previously were thought to be ineffective because of the development of resistance, if the patient's strain could be found to be susceptible to that antibiotic. Previous studies found that a single dose of ciprofloxacin was highly effective in gonococcal infection caused by strains susceptible to the drug and ciprofloxacin was the recommended regimen for gonorrhea until 2007. In fact, 60% of gonococcal infections in the UK (https://www.cdc.gov/std/stats18/GISP2018/docs/gisp_2018_supplement_final_2020.pdf) and 70% in the USA (https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/834924/GRASP__2018_report.pdf) were still susceptible to ciprofloxacin when studied in 2018.

Detection of the absence of the single point mutation in the gyrA gene that determines ciprofloxacin resistance in a patient's _Neisseria gonorrhoeae_ strain would be an indication that their infection could be treated with ciprofloxacin. The development of rapid point-of-care (POC) molecular assays enables determination of susceptibility to be conducted, results obtained, and treatment performed during the same clinical visit, allowing the selection of an appropriate treatment regimen, like single-dose ciprofloxacin, which was once abandoned because of resistance.

The study above evaluated, using a decision tree model that simulated a hypothetical cohort of 38 870 clinic attendees, a rapid test that detects genetic determinants of fluoroquinolone and/or azithromycin resistance (gyrA for ciprofloxacin and 23S rRNA and mtrCDE transporter for azithromycin) in 5 different hypothetical strategies for the treatment of _N. gonorrhoeae_, which enable use of ciprofloxacin and/or azithromycin, either alongside or as an alternative to ceftriaxone.

The regimens in the study that spared ceftriaxone in the hypothetical strategies were monotherapy with either ciprofloxacin or azithromycin. Although monotherapy with azithromycin, 2 g orally as a single dose, has been demonstrated to be 99.2% effective against uncomplicated urogenital gonorrhea, monotherapy is not recommended by the CDC because of documented azithromycin treatment failures and concerns of emerging azithromycin resistance (https://www.cdc.gov/std/tg2015/gonorrhea.htm).

A different, actual proof-of-concept clinical study that used a PCR assay to screen for the presence of wild-type gyrA to determine susceptibility of the patient's _N. gonorrhoeae_ found that a single oral dose of ciprofloxacin, 500 mg, alone cured all 106 clinic patients with 117 gonorrhea infections (https://academic.oup.com/cid/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa596/5882191?redirectedFrom=fulltext). Two patients with non-wild-type gyrA infections, who were accidentally included, failed to respond to the therapy. - Mod.ML]
