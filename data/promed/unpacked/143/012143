8 cases of Legionnaires' disease have been detected in Montpellier (Herault) since mid-August 2015. 1 patient died in Nimes; another 2 remain hospitalized; and 5 others have recovered. All had recently been in the city center of Montpellier.

The Regional Health Agency (ARS) of Languedoc-Roussillon says this is an "unusual increase" in cases. Each case is being investigated to identify the sources of exposure to _Legionella_ bacteria.

The ARS stated that, as a precaution, "fountains were stopped" and "the use of patio misters by Montpellier drinking establishments was suspended until further notice." Legionellosis is a serious lung disease with a 2- to 10-day incubation period that affects adults and particularly vulnerable people. This disease is transmitted exclusively by inhalation (inhalation of contaminated water diffused spray, shower, whirlpool, etc.).

Hospital services in the region, general practitioners, and labs are on the alert to quickly identify and treat any new cases, France 3 [a French public television channel] stated.

[Surveillance of Legionnaires' disease (LD) in France started in 1987 with a mandatory clinician-based notification system (http://www.q-net.net.au/~legion/Legionnaires_Disease_France.htm). France also participates in the European LD surveillance network (ELDSNet) related to travel-associated cases. _Legionella_ isolates have been routinely typed in France since 2008 by 3 methods: use of monoclonal antibodies, PFGE (pulsed-field gel electrophoresis), and amplification and sequencing of 7 selected genes to identify common-source outbreaks (sequencing can be done directly on pulmonary samples, even if no strain is isolated) to detect case clusters that have a common source and then identify their source of contamination (1).

In 2013, 1262 cases of LD were reported in France (incidence rate 1.94 per 100 000 individuals, which was reported to be similar to those of Italy, Spain, Denmark, and the Netherlands, but higher than the European average of 1.2 per 100 000 individuals in 2012 (1). The annual incidence rate of LD in France initially rose dramatically, probably because of increasingly more complete reporting, but has been stable since 2008 (1). The sources of contamination for most cases of LD in France were not identified, but almost 50 percent of cases were noted to be nosocomial and 6 percent involved people who lived in an institution for the elderly in 2013 (1).

More information on the epidemiology of the current outbreak in Montpellier from knowledgeable sources would be appreciated.

Montpellier, the 8th largest city in France, with a population of 268 456 in 2012, is the capital of the Languedoc-Roussillon region, as well as the Herault department; it is located on the south coast of France on the Mediterranean Sea (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montpellier). Nimes, with an estimated population of 146 709 in 2012, is also a city in the Languedoc-Roussillon region of southern France (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NÃ®mes), about 28 miles (45 km) northeast of Montpellier.
