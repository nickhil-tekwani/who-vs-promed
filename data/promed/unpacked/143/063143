S.Korea orders deer cull after CWD cases found
----------------------------------------------
South Korea said on Saturday [20 Nov 2004] it found 4 elk infected with the
fatal Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD) and had strengthened quarantine controls
nationwide.
The CWD-infected animals were the offspring of elk raised on a farm in
southern Kyungsang province after being brought in from Canada, the
agricultural ministry said in a statement.
It is the country's 2nd outbreak of CWD, which disrupts the nervous system.
The 1st case was found in 2001 [see comment].
The government has ordered the slaughter of 78 other deer at the farm and
wants preemptive tests on deer nationwide.
The ministry said there is no evidence of CWD's transmission to humans and
other animals.

[The 1st case of CWD in Korea (apparently, the 1st CWD case outside north
America) involved a 7-year-old male elk (_Cervus elaphus nelsoni_) that was
clinically suspected (a 3-week history of body weight loss, emaciation,
excessive salivation, teeth grinding, fever, anorexia, and respiratory
distress), euthanised, and necropsied. For details see: Hyun-Joo Sohn et al
(2002). A Case of Chronic Wasting Disease in an Elk Imported to Korea from
Canada; . Journal of Veterinary Medical Science 64, 9, 855-858.
<http://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jvms/64/9/855/_pdf>.
CWD has been diagnosed on game ranches in Saskatchewan and Alberta since its
initial recording in Canada in 1996. The 1st case (See posting
19960501.0841) involved a single elk located on a small game farm facility
in southern Saskatchewan, which had been imported as a yearling, in 1989, as
part of a small shipment of elk originating from the USA.
In 2001, CWD was recorded in wild deer in Saskatchewan.
The import of elk to South Korea is related to the local demand for antlers
(velvet). - Mod.AS]
[For over 2000 years people in Asia have been using the skin [of deer
antlers], known as deer velvet, as an aphrodisiac. But see: Furry skin on
antlers doesn't work as aphrodisiac, according to new research.
