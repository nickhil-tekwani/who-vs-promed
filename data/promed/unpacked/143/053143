The spread of the virus that causes foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) has caused
meat prices to dive and has affected exports, and peasants [in China.
Relevant government departments have distributed internal instructions
warning against improper handling of meat. Reports claim the disease has
spread to the provinces of Shaanxi, Gansu and Henan, where large numbers of
livestock were said to have been killed to stem the spread of the disease.
Major cities, including Xian, were particularly hard-hit and the Government
had abandoned the slaughtering tax to relieve the burden on peasants.
[The content of the report suggests both pigs and cattle are involved in the
outbreak. - Mod. CYC
