[Duck viral enteritis (DVE), also called duck plague, is an acute, highly
contagious infection of ducks, geese, and swans of all ages, caused by a
herpesvirus. It is characterized by sudden death, high mortality
(particularly among older ducks), and hemorrhages and necrosis in internal
organs. DVE is reported in domestic and wild waterfowl in Europe, Asia,
North America, and Africa. Field strains of the causative herpesvirus are
similar antigenically but vary considerably in pathogenicity.
An effective chick-embryo-adapted, modified live vaccine is available for
use in domestic ducks, administered subcutaneously.
DVE is not a zoonosis.
Diagnosis of DVE -- an Office International des Epizooties list B disease
-- is based on a combination of assessing the clinical signs, gross
pathology, and histopathology supported by the isolation and identification
of the virus; for details see
<http://www.oie.int/eng/normes/mmanual/A_00096.htm>.
Newcastle disease, avian influenza, and fowl pox may cause similar lesions,
but they are rarely reported in ducks. Laboratory confirmation of this
suspected outbreak is pending. - Mod.AS]
