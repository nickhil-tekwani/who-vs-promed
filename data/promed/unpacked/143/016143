Cat owners have been asked to be careful following the discovery of an "HIV-like" virus in one.

The cat that was tested was found to have feline immunodeficiency virus [FIV], Pathologists Lancet Kenya said on Wednesday [1 Jun 2016].

Veterinary pathologist Dhaval Shah said FIV is in the same family as the human immunodeficiency virus [HIV].

"This is the 1st case of serologically-confirmed FIV that we in the veterinary community are aware of in Kenya," said Shah [see comment].

Serology refers to the scientific study of body fluids including serum.

"The pet cat was subjected to the lab test by its owners after it exhibited gradual loss of weight over a period of time and lack of energy," Shah said in a statement.

The pathologist noted that members of the public should not be quick to get rid of their cats as the virus cannot be transmitted to humans.

"Humans cannot be affected by FIV nor can cats get HIV. This discovery should prompt owners to protect their cats from exposure to the virus by keeping them indoors," he said.

Noting that the virus is common among cats that roam freely, Shah said the virus is spread through bites during fighting.

He said infected cats exhibit symptoms such as fever, weight loss, lymph node enlargement, recurrent bouts of illness, lethargy, loss of appetite and diarrhoea.

"They also tend to have higher rates of cancers and blood diseases," he added.

[While this case might be the 1st one to be lab diagnosed and published in Kenya, the virus must have been long circulating there. FIV was reported from wild felidae in eastern and southern Africa since the 1990s (Ref 1).

FIV was 1st isolated and described in 1986 from domestic cats with immunodeficiency-like syndromes in a northern California [USA] cattery. The 5 major subtypes (clades) of FIV are designated A through E, and each has a particular geographic distribution throughout the world. FIV is similar to HIV in genome structure and immunopathogenesis, and has been utilized as the only naturally occurring animal model of immunodeficiency for HIV infection in people.

Acute FIV infection results in flu-like symptoms including peripheral lymphadenopathy, neutropenia, and pyrexia. During terminal stages of infection, animals exhibit feline acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (FAIDS), which includes opportunistic infections, lymphomas, wasting, and death. As in HIV infection, there is typically a protracted asymptomatic phase lasting at least several years prior to the terminal immunodeficiency syndrome. Despite a lack of clinical signs, there is evidence of immunological impairment (CD4+ T cell depletion and CD4/CD8 ratio inversion) during the asymptomatic phase.

The above and additional useful information is included in Ref 2.
