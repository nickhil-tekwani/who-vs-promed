Two persons have fallen ill with malaria in Ryazan. Both patients did not
go outside the region in the past 3 years and did not undergo blood
transfusions [possible sources of infection - Mod.JW.
Experts have found out that they fell ill as a result of an infected
mosquito bite, an official at the Russian Health Ministry's Department for
Sanitary and Epidemiological Supervision told Itar-Tass here on Friday.
Until recently, there were no malarial mosquitoes in Russia. However, a
year ago scientists discovered the blood-sucking carriers of the disease in
Moscow region, Saratov, Kurgan and Volgograd regions as well as in
Krasnodar territory. In 1998, isolated malaria cases were recorded in
Russia, with the disease caused by bites of
"local" breeds of mosquitoes. In all the other cases, people contracted
malaria in other countries.

[I donÂ´t think the statement "Until recently, there were no malarial
mosquitoes in Russia" is correct. There probably have always been
Anophelines around, but they have not found a source & the right seasonal
conditions to transmit malaria in recent years - Mod.JW
