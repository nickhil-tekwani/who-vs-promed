Country & date: Brazil, 17 Jan 2006
Type: unofficial
Issue: Latest reports from the Brazilian government show that there have
been no new outbreaks of foot and mouth disease registered in the state of
Mato Grosso do Sul. However, an outbreak was reported on a ranch in the
state of Parana.
Summary: An outbreak was reported on a ranch in the municipality of So
Sebastio da Amoreira in the state of Parana. The affected farm, which has
1772 fattening cattle for rearing and breeding, remains under quarantine.
Other suspect farms in the municipalities of Loanda, Amapora, Grandes Rios,
and Maringa continue to be under quarantine, as well as properties within a
10 kilometer radius, where vaccination is prohibited. A farm in the
municipality of Bela Vista, which received animals from an outbreak in
Eldorado in the State of Mato Grosso do Sul, is also under quarantine.
These farms are undergoing a serological investigation for the detection of
non-structural proteins, since the attempts at viral isolation were completed.
