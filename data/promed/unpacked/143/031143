Traces of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) detected in Punjab
------------------------------------------------
On Friday, the government said traces of FMD had been reported in parts of
Punjab, especially in Ludhiana district. Steps had been initiated to save
the livestock.
Minister of state for agriculture, Dr Debendra Pradhan, informed the Rajya
Sabha in a written reply 191 animals out of a total of 2266 had been
affected and 29 had perished.
Pradhan said a special prophylactic vaccination drive had been launched in
Ludhiana and adjoining districts. Veterinary experts from Punjab
Agricultural University had been rushed to the area.
He outlined various other measures to combat the dreaded disease saying
instructions had been issued for careful screening of livestock products
from the United Kingdom, where the disease is reported to be rampant.
The state government had been asked to check movement of livestock from
Pakistan also. Naik said the government was monitoring the import of
agricultural commodities.
