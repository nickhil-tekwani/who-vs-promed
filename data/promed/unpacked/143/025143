Poisonous Cassava Kills 10
--------------
In the Butere/Mumias District 10 people have died after eating
poisonous cassava believed to have originated from Uganda. The Western
Provincial Medical Officer, Dr Jackson Songa, said the cassava had
been attacked by the Cynide virus [sic: see note below]. He said
symptoms of the disease are vomiting, diarrhea, and general weakness.
Sufferers can also relapse into a coma and develop a swollen abdomen,
Songa said. He ordered public health officials to destroy cassava in
all farms and markets in the province to ensure that no more lives are
lost.
Songa, who was speaking in Kakamega, said although initial reports
indicated 10 people had died, the ministry has only confirmed 3
deaths. He said the affected areas are Musanda, Ekero, Mayoni,
Matungu, and Namulungu. He said the famine which has hit parts of the
district was to blame, as children were being fed on raw cassava. He
advised area residents to boil their cassava before eating it.
He said Ministry of Health officials are working with their Ministry
of Agriculture and Kenya Agriculture Research Institute (Kari)
counterparts to eradicate the poisonous variety of cassava. The area
Medical Officer of Health (MOH), Dr George Matete, has banned
harvesting of the crop in Butere/Mumias District.

[Cyanide is a normal component of cassava. However, certain weather
conditions, such as drought or freezing, may make the cyanide more
available during consumption of the cassava. There is no such thing as
a cyanide virus. This may be a case of a virus affecting the cassava,
or it may be a case of higher-than-normal levels of cyanide being
present in the cassava. The human body can metabolize very low levels
of cyanide. However, when those low levels are exceeded and overwhelm
the bodys ability to deal with it, then cyanide poisoning develops.
The Ministry may be trying to remove from the market the cassava that
has higher concentrations of cyanide than normal due to drought
stress. - Mod.TG]
