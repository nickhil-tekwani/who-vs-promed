LEPTOSPIROSIS, FATAL - IRELAND

A growing number of people in Ireland are falling victim to a
potentially fatal infection linked to contact with farm animals and
water sports. The number of cases of leptospirosis rose to 30 in
2008, compared to 22 in 2007. It caused the death of one elderly
patient, as well as 17 hospitalisations.

A total of 10 picked up the illness on farms and 9 had been involved
in watersports like canoeing, swimming outdoors and a triathlon.
Others were infected while gardening, spending time by a river bank
or holidaying in a tropical destination.

Dr Darina O'Flanagan, head of the Health Protection Surveillance
Centre, has expressed concern at the increase in the disease, which,
she said, occurs mainly in adult men. Leptospirosis in Ireland is
usually picked up from rats, although a milder form can be caught
from cattle or dogs. Leptospirosis is transmitted to humans by
contact with the urine of rats, cattle, foxes, rodents and other wild
animals. It is an infectious condition that can cause a range of
different symptoms such as mild flu-like symptoms. In severe cases,
it can result in multiple organ failure and internal bleeding.

Animals, such as rats, pigs and dogs, can become infected by bacteria
called leptospires. They can then contaminate a water source by
urinating into it. If a human comes into close contact with the
infected water, such as through the eyes, mouth, and nose or cuts in
their skin, they can become infected with leptospirosis. The disease
watchdog said those at risk included people who engaged in outdoor
pursuits in contaminated areas -- farmers, workers in contact with
canal or river water, vets, meat inspectors, butchers, and abattoir
and sewer workers. Dog owners and those who work with dogs may be at
risk if hygiene is inadequate. Recent cases have occurred in golfers
who retrieved golf balls from stagnant pools.

The symptoms of leptospirosis can vary widely from person to person.
Some people with the condition have no symptoms at all, although most
will experience symptoms that are similar to influenza. There is no
reason not to participate in freshwater recreational activities, such
as swimming, sailing, water skiing or windsurfing. However, it is a
sensible precaution to cover any cuts and grazes with a waterproof
dressing. Shower or bathe after your activity.

If you get a flu-like illness within a 3-week period after engaging
in any of these activities you should visit your doctor immediately,
and tell her or him of your fears and possible exposure to the disease.

[Although all the outbreaks of leptospirosis that were posted by
ProMED last year (2009) occurred in developing countries
(Philippines, India, and Fiji), the above news release serves as a
reminder that people are also at risk of acquiring leptospirosis in
developed countries.

Leptospirosis occurs worldwide and affects humans and a variety of
animals including dogs, cattle, pigs, and rodents. Chronically
infected animals excrete leptospires in their urine. Leptospirosis is
an occupational hazard for many people who work outdoors or with
animals, for example, farmers, sewer workers, veterinarians, fish
workers, dairy farmers, or military personnel. It is a recreational
hazard for campers or those who participate in outdoor sports, such
as fishing, golfing, swimming, wading, or whitewater rafting, that
involve exposure to water in lakes, rivers, or ponds contaminated by
urine from leptospire-infected animals
(<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dbmd/diseaseinfo/leptospirosis_g.htm>).

Leptospirosis also been reported in city dwellers in, for example,
the USA (Vinetz JM, Glass GE, Flexner CE, Mueller P. Sporadic urban
leptospirosis. Ann Intern Med. 1996;125(10):794-8) and Japan (Koizumi
N, Muto M, Tanikawa T, et al. Human leptospirosis cases and the
prevalence of rats harbouring _Leptospira interrogans_ in urban areas
of Tokyo, Japan. J Med Microbiol 2009; 58: 1227-30), in the absence
of recognized occupational or recreational exposure. These urban
cases were presumably acquired by exposure to infected rat urine or
contact with urine of infected dogs (Wong ML, Kaplan S, Dunkle LM, et
al. Leptospirosis: a childhood disease. J Pediat 1977; 90:532-7). No
data for leptospirosis is available for the USA since 1995, when
leptospirosis ceased to be a nationally notifiable disease
(<http://www.leptospirosis.org/topic.php?t=44>), although it is still
reportable in some states; see
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/eId/vol10no3/03-0431.htm> for a recent
discussion of leptospirosis in California.
