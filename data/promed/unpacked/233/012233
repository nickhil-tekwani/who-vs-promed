In recent hours, 2 new cases of hantavirus [infections] were confirmed
by the Institute of Public Health (ISP) after one of these individuals
died as a result of the disease, while the other patient is
hospitalized in Coyhaique. The institution stated that both cases had
been exposed [to the virus] in a risk situation.

The person who died was indigent, 67 years old, with mental problems,
and was found lifeless on a public street on 15 Aug [2011] in Villa
Amengual. With this history, the body was sent to Legal Medical
Services of Coyhaique, where an autopsy revealed bilateral
bronchopneumonia. [A] hantavirus infection was suspected, so samples
were sent to the ISP, where positive results confirmed the presence of
the virus.

"Subsequent epidemiological visits confirmed that the man lived in a
situation of evident risk for contracting the disease [virus], an
unstable place with the presence of mice. Everything seemed to
anticipate that the cause of the disease was [a] hantavirus
[infection]," stated the health SEREMI [Secretaria Regional
Ministerial de Salud; Regional Ministerial Secretariat], Claudio
Vallejos.

The patient in hospital is a young person of 24 years of age from the
El Salto sector between Puerto Aysen and Puerto Chacabuco, who was
admitted on 12 Aug [2011] to the intensive care unit.

In the context of these 2 cases, following a session of the hantavirus
regional committee, there was agreement to maintain preventive
measures and protection against the disease in the face of national
holidays.

[It is not clear whether these cases are among the 6 previously
reported from this area (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20110822.2551).
Although not specified, the hantavirus most likely involved in these
cases is Andes virus. The reservoir rodent species are not
identified.

longicaudatus_), the sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus, can
