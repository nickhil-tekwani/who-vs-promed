[On 4 Aug 2013 Namibia reported 3 outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) in the Zambezi (formerly Caprivi) region. Serotype SAT 1 was identified. See event summary and final report at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?reportid=13882 and http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000014777_20140214_173446.pdf respectively.

In December 2011 and early 2012 Namibia also reported FMD. 4 outbreaks were reported in Caprivi region where serotype SAT 1 was identified. See event summary and map http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?reportid=11339.

In June 2014, Botswana reported one outbreak of FMD (see ProMED-mail 20140627.2568443), where serotype SAT 1 was also identified. See last follow-up report at, http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000015806_20140811_174433.pdf.

This outbreak in Botswana is located close to the border with the Zambezi region of Namibia. See the map of the event summary of Botswana http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?reportid=15482 and compare with the map of this latest event of Namibia (http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?reportid=15935 (Note: To view the area of interest and outbreak information in greater detail, click on the map to zoom in.)

Based on what is described above, the serotype that may be again identified will likely be SAT 1. - Mod.CRD
