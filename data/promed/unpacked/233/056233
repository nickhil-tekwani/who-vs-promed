[1] Rabies in jackals spreads to Israel's centre.
Date: Sat 3 Feb 2018
From: Nir Rudoler <nir.rudoler@mail.huji.ac.il> [edited]


The rabies outbreak among wildlife is continuing to expand in Israel. Yesterday [Fri, 2 Feb 2018], a positive case of jackal was confirmed near Moshav Omets, Hefer valley. Increased awareness among pet onwner's is required.

[Dr Rudoler is gratefully acknowledged for this update. The new case in Moshav Omets (map at https://tinyurl.com/yd824tbk) means a 20 km [12.42 miles approx.] leap of rabies in jackals in a south-westward direction from the nearest earlier outbreak, reported in Mu'awiya (Basma; map at https://tinyurl.com/y73dnljy). Another case in western Israel was reported from Bat-Shlomo, 25 km [15.53 miles approx.] northern to Omets.

The exceptional jackal-borne epizootic has spread, since its start in early October 2017, from the Jordan valley on Israel's eastern border with the Kingdom of Jordan, westwards and south-westwards to the Hefer valley (Sharon region) along the Mediterranean in central Israel, a distance of about 100 km [62.13 miles approx.]. Since [Sun 8 Oct 2017], 36 rabid jackals were lab-confirmed until the end of 2017. Since the beginning of 2018 and as of [Fri 2 Feb 2018], 20 additional rabid jackals have already been lab-confirmed.

Israel's interactive rabies map of 2017 (whole year) is available at https://tinyurl.com/y8hh2wxb. The interactive rabies map of 2018 (as of [Tue 30 Jan 2018]; the new case in Omets, [Fri 2 Feb 2018], has not yet been signed on the map), is available at https://tinyurl.com/ya6q5hrs.

Clearly, this exceptional epizootic has not yet peaked in spite of reported enhanced dissemination of vaccine baits and the shooting of jackals in the affected area (see commentary in previous posts on the subject).

Israel's last case of rabies in a human took place in 2002. The number of post-exposure treatments during the current event is not yet officially available, but reportedly exceeds the figures of previous years. This includes the personnel of several rabies-affected cattle farms in northern Israel. - Mod.AS]

The World Health Organization (WHO) has notified a rabies immunisation protocol developed by Omesh Bharti, 49, a government doctor in Himachal Pradesh, as the new global standard. The procedure, successfully tested on thousands of dog and monkey bite victims in the past 5 years, brings down the cost of treatment from Rs 35 000 [USD 545.65] to Rs 350 [USD 5.46] per patient!

The existing treatment involved injecting patients with the rabies vaccine and rabies immunoglobulin (RIG) extracted from horse or human blood. Human RIG, which needed to be administered in large doses as per the victim's body weight, cost Rs 6000-8000 [USD 93.54-124.72] per vial, and was "beyond the reach of most victims". Working at the time (2013-2015) as a health officer with the Shimla Municipal Corporation, Bharti had rare access to brain tissue samples from rabid dogs, monkeys and Himalayan palm civets found dead in the area. He evolved a protocol that required a fraction of the RIG needed for conventional treatment. "A tiny amount of RIG injected directly into the wound was just as effective as administering large amounts," he says. Similarly, administering 'intra-dermally' rather than as an 'intra-muscular' injection required less than a 10th of the vaccine. Despite early scepticism, the meeting of WHO's Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) in Bangkok in 2016, included Bharti's protocol in its agenda for discussion. "By then, we had 7000 successful cases in Himachal," he says.

It helped that Himachal health authorities avidly supported Bharti's work. Even before WHO's endorsement, Bharti has trained scores of local medical professionals deployed at myriad state-run rabies clinics across the state. Himachal has now made rabies treatment (using RIG) free.

"In 2017, there were just 2 rabies-related deaths [in HP]-one a woman who refused treatment; the other a youth who went to a private practitioner," says Bharti.

Finally endorsed by the SAGE in Geneva on [Mon 15 Jan 2018] as "cost-, dose- and time-sparing, while assuring safety and clinical effectiveness", the updated WHO recommendations on rabies immunisation supersede its 2010 position. A full version of the new protocol is in cue for publication in the Weekly Epidemiological Record in April [2018].

[A summary of WHO updated position on Rabies vaccines and immunoglobulins, as endorsed by the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on immunization (SAGE) at its meeting of 17-19 Oct 2017, is available at http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/259855/1/WHO-CDS-NTD-NZD-2018.04-eng.pdf?ua=1.

It includes the following introduction: "The new WHO recommendations for rabies immunization supersede the 2010 WHO position on pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) for rabies. These updated recommendations are based on new evidence and directed by public health needs that are cost-, dose- and time-sparing, while assuring safety and clinical effectiveness. In addition, new guidance on prudent use of rabies immunoglobulins (RIG) is provided".

The conclusions and recommendations of the SAGE meeting have been published in WHO's Weekly Epidemiological Record of 1 Dec 2017 (No 48, 2017, 92, 729-748; http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/259533/1/WER9248.pdf), including the following useful statement:
"New evidence from Cambodia and United Republic of Tanzania shows that when thorough wound washing and prompt administration of vaccine are provided to category III bite victims, 99 percent survive. Trials and programmatic experience indicate that infiltration of RIG in and around the wound neutralizes rabies virus within hours, whereas RIG administered IM distant to the wound is of limited value. These procedures allow RIG dose-sparing by calculating the maximum dose based on body weight, and injecting only the volume needed to infiltrate the wound(s). Guidance for aseptic use of remaining RIG will need to be developed. Equine RIG (eRIG) is clinically equivalent to human RIG (hRIG) and skin testing prior to its administration is unnecessary and should be discontinued".

As indicated in the above media report, the full version of the WHO position on rabies vaccines and immunoglobulins will be published in the Weekly Epidemiological Record in April 2018.
