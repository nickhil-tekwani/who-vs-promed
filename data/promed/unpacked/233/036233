Liaoning Publishes Investigation Results of Milk Poisoning Case
--------------------------
The government of Anshan city and health department of Liaoning Province
published on 16 Apr 2003 the investigation results at the second news
briefing of the milk poisoning case in Haicheng city.
On 19 Mar 2003, about 4900 students from 8 elementary schools in Haicheng
drank a certain kind of soy milk and 2556 of them became sick afterward.
From 9 to 15 Apr 2003, the Ministry of Health and Liaoning health
department jointly formed an investigation team, consisting of experts on
food security, epidemic diseases, food processing, microbiology, and
clinical medicine, and conducted investigations into the cases [of illness]
caused by soy milk produced by Baorun Milk Co, a Sino-United States joint
venture based in the city of Anshan in Liaoning Province.
The experts determined that some kind of trypsin inhibitor in the soy milk
was the cause of the accident, and people allergic to the agent would
suffer digestive tract problems after consuming the soy milk. They also
ruled out the possibility of bacterial, chemical, and animal poisons.
Experts also held that people usually recover well from the sickness and
there will be no long-term, potential harm to the body.
Anshan mayor Zhang Jiehui reported on the investigation work of both Anshan
and Haicheng authorities, making 2 promises to the society. First, the
Anshan government will be responsible for the health and safety of the 2556
pupils to the end [?] and will make all efforts to ensure that all students
recover from the illness. Second, the government will handle this case and
the people involved according to law and the principles of "being just,
transparent and no cover-up for anybody".
Anshan government also made known that the death of Li Yang, a 12-year-old
girl who died 2 weeks after drinking the soy milk at school, was caused by
carbon monoxide poisoning, and not the milk. As of the evening of 15 Apr
2003, 84 pupils had been under treatment in 3 local hospitals.

[Something seems odd. The previous report indicated 3 children had died as
a result of the possibly tainted milk. However, this article addresses the
death of only one child, implying that the other 2 did die from the milk.
The previous posting also indicated that some children had gone blind.
The previous report also indicated: "...the children experienced stomach
aches, headaches, dizziness, and twitching. The edges of many children's
eyes, noses, and mouths went black and blue."
Though soy products have been known to affect those with soy allergies, the
effects generally do not include the clinical signs mentioned above. There
are limited studies, primarily in animals, and anecdotal accounts of soya
having negative impacts on thyroid function, links to mineral deficiencies,
and to Alzheimer's disease.
Although there may be trypsin-inhibiting enzymes, the clinical signs
mentioned in the previous posts do not fit with trypsin inhibition.
Furthermore, it seems extremely odd that approximately 52 percent of the
children would be affected all at once, and at 8 different locations.
It seems unlikely that this is only trypsin inhibition. - Mod.TG]
