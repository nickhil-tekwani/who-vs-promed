As of today, 15 Jul 2011, the cumulative number of probable and
confirmed STEC cases in the EU/EEA is 3908. This includes 765 HUS STEC
cases and 3143 non-HUS STEC cases. In total, 41 infected persons have
died, of which 26 were HUS STEC cases, and 15 were non-HUS STEC
cases.

In Germany, since the last update, 3 HUS STEC cases and 38 non-HUS
STEC cases have been reported. Two HUS STEC deaths and one non-HUS
STEC fatality have been excluded. Within the last 10 days (5-14 Jul
2011), 8 non-HUS STEC cases fell ill. The last known date of illness
onset in a patient with confirmed STEC O104 was 7 Jul 2011. The last
reported date of illness onset among all cases was 8 Jul 2011.

[By noting the EU number of daily HUS and non-HUS cases, and their
total as well as deaths reported, the daily trends of the numbers can

Fri 15 Jul: 3 / 38 / 41 / 41 (3 deaths excluded by ECDC)

Total cases: 3908 with 41 deaths, 1.05 per cent case fatality rate.
The new case definition resulted in lower total cases and deaths but
did not affect the case fatality rate.

Suspected cases (Germany: 146 HUS STEC (7 deaths), France: 5 non-HUS
STEC) are not included.

The cases do not necessarily reflect date of onset of disease but
rather when the diagnosis was made and reported. The number of newly
reported cases per day clearly decreased from the corresponding day in
the previous week.

Cases continue to be recognized more than 2 months after the initial
cases occurred.

No data are yet available regarding the use of certain antimicrobials
such as imipenem as an adjuvant treatment or whether the
anti-complement monoclonal antibody eculizumab has had a reproducible
clinical effect. - Mod.LL]

[2] Non-identity of 2004 S. Korean strain
Date: Fri 16 Jul 2011

Beginning in early May 2011, an outbreak caused by Shiga
toxin-producing _E. coli_ O104:H4 was reported in Germany and other
countries in Europe. In this outbreak, the number of hemolytic uremic
syndrome (HUS) cases has been unusually high (1). A case of HUS caused
by _E. coli_ O104:H4 was 1st reported in South Korea in 2004 (2).

Because infections caused by _E. coli_ O104:H4 have been reported
rarely, interest has arisen in the O104:H4 strain from South Korea. We
characterized the strain isolated in South Korea (EC0417119) in 2004
and compared it with the O104:H4 strain associated with the current
EHEC outbreak in Europe.

The serotype EC0417119, isolated from a patient with HUS in 2004, was
reconfirmed as _E. coli_ O104:H4. The strain was positive for stx1 and
stx2 by PCR (3) but negative for aggR by PCR (4). In the antimicrobial
drug susceptibility test using VITEK 2 AST-N169 test kit (bioMerieux,
Marcy L'Etoile, France), the strain was resistant to ampicillin,
ampicillin/sulbactam, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole but
susceptible to ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, nalidixic acid, and
tetracycline.

We also performed pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) for
EC0417119, according to the PulseNet standard protocol (5), and
compared its PFGE profile with that of the current outbreak strain _E.
coli_ O104:H4, which was obtained from the PulseNet Asia Pacific
network. PFGE profiles resolved by either XbaI or BlnI did not match
each other. The percentage similarity of XbaI- and BlnI-digested PFGE
profiles of the 2 isolates was 75 percent and 66.7 percent,
respectively, as shown in the Figure [to see figure, go to original
URL - Mod.LL].

Infections with the EHEC O104 strain were reported several times
worldwide. In Europe, such occurrences were rare, and before the
current outbreak, the EHEC O104:H4 strain was documented only once in
South Korea. For this reason, it was logical to examine the possible
relatedness of the EC0417119 strain and the strain causing the current
outbreak. However, the EC0417119 strain has many different
characteristics compared to the current outbreak strain: not
possessing enteroaggregative _E. coli_ determinant, not producing
extended spectrum beta-lactamases, and not showing indistinguishable
PFGE patterns. In conclusion, there is no evidence that the _E. coli_
O104:H4 strain isolated in South Korea in 2004 is related to the
strain that has caused the massive and unprecedented EHEC outbreak in
Europe.
