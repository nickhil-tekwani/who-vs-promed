Ebola virus disease (EVD) was discovered earlier this year [2014] in the forest region of Guinea, and it arrived [again] at the beginning of this month [May 2014]. It has already caused 3 suspected deaths, 2 confirmed patients, and [possibly infecting] 41 who had been in contact with them. But the population of Telimele cannot believe the presence of this cursed virus in their prefecture.

"We set up a crisis committee with the missions that arrived to fight Ebola. Besides NGOs such as the Red Cross and others, we are talking with the prefectural authorities and the technical services of health, education, civil society, etc." said the mayor, Elhadj Alpha Oumar Bah Bantayah, on the phone with Guineenews. The mayor mentioned the behavior of the citizens, most of whom still refuse to believe the presence of the ebolavirus in Telimele and he acknowledged that "some believe it is the devil and others think it is the politicians' doing."

As we know, the most popular version in the afflicted village of Sogoroyah (victim) and surroundings is that the head of the family which had victims and patients had cleared a field by burning it and the fire spread out and damaged "the home and property" of an old devil woman, who had then decided to take revenge on the man's family"... "I went to see the field yesterday in Hore Poodhe. Here in town and in all service [institutions], we use bleach everywhere. But, as you know, people do not like to be greeted without shaking hands, otherwise you would be considered standoffish and too proud," confided Mamadou Balde Lamarana, host of the rural radio station in Telimele, on Saturday [24 May 2014].

According to the mayor of Telimele, several committees are now set up to fight the disease, including a commission of communication and awareness. Also, wise men and preachers in mosques will explain to the people in a simple way how to behave and what to do during this outbreak.

[This is a sad development. All of Guinea was free of EVD after 42 days without a case, except Gueckedou, which has now gone 10 days without a reported case, and it looked as though the epidemic was close to an end.

Denial and attribution to spirits have to be overcome by public education in this new area. It is good that NGOs are there and a rapid response is being organized.
