The Salt Lake County Health Department had been ruling out cholera in the cases of 2 older county residents who came down with severe diarrhea. Test results were returned from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] on Thursday, 2 Jul 2015. The tests indicate the 2 have vibriosis, a related disease that has symptoms similar to cholera but is less infectious, according to a department news release.

The department sent samples to CDC earlier this week after medical providers reported they suspected cholera. The disease is one of dozens of illnesses that providers must report to health departments in Utah.

Cholera and vibriosis are caused by the bacterium _Vibrio cholera_. "Some strains of _V. cholera_ cause cholera disease and are to blame for the cholera outbreaks known throughout history and in present-day developing nations," health department managers said in a statement. "Lab tests have determined that the 2 symptomatic patients in Salt Lake County do not have these outbreak-related strains of the bacteria. Instead, they have a strain that causes vibriosis."

Vibriosis results in watery, sometimes bloody, diarrhea and abdominal cramps, often accompanied by nausea, vomiting, fever, chills and headache. Doctors typically treat it by hydrating the patient, though the symptoms usually resolve without treatment within 2 to 3 days. Vibriosis leads to 185 hospitalizations and 57 deaths in the United States each year, the health department said.

Strains of the bacterium that cause vibriosis are often found in coastal marine areas, and their numbers increase dramatically during the warm summer months. "Consuming raw, undercooked, or cross-contaminated seafood, especially shellfish, is the most common cause of vibriosis, but exposure to contaminated water can also cause infection," the department noted.

Health department staff members are interviewing those infected to learn, if possible, the source of the illness. Citing state and federal patient privacy laws, spokesman Nicholas Rupp declined to provide any details about the patients -- including their genders or whether they recently traveled to a foreign country. He did say both are 65 years old or older. "They are being treated and it's not life-threatening," Rupp said.

Current laws allow the health department to provide more detail in cases where the public may be at risk of infection, he said. In this case, however, "We don't think there's a risk to the public," Rupp said. Salt Lake County last confirmed cases of vibriosis in 2014, 2011 and 2009.

[Non-cholera vibriosis can be caused by _V. parahaemolyticus_ and _V. vulnificus_ among others. The posting implies that the isolates were indeed _V. cholerae_ but not the epidemic-potential serotypes O1 or O139.

In almost all cases, non-O1, non-O139 _V. cholerae_ isolates do not possess the genes for either cholera toxin or the toxin-coregulated pilus (TCP). Yet, some isolates can cause substantial diarrhea (1-4). The type III secretion system (TTSS) is a mechanism for Gram negative bacilli to introduce effector proteins into host cell cytoplasm (5). It has been reported that a functional TTSS is required for at least some non-O1, non-O139 isolates to induce diarrhea in an animal model associated with small bowel damage and production of proinflammatory cytokines (6). In addition, TTSS contributes to virulence even in the presence of cholera toxin and TCP (6).

No information regarding potential sources of the pathogen is given such as travel or ingestion of seafood from the Gulf Coast or from overseas or travel to endemic areas. Ogg and colleagues (7) have reported non-O1 _V. cholerae_ from aquatic birds in Colorado and Utah. In addition, non-O1 strains have been recovered from surface waters in Colorado more than 800 miles from the nearest coast (8). Furthermore, several cases of non-O1 cholera infections were reported slightly south of Utah and Colorado in Arizona in individuals whose risk factors seemed to be swimming in local rivers (9).
