The Tennessee Department of Health is issuing a public health advisory urging residents to increase their awareness about hepatitis C, a potentially life-threatening disease spread by direct contact with blood from an infected person.

The Knox County Health Department says it's important to know all the risk factors. Within the last year there's been an increase of testing for the virus at the health department. Director Dr. Martha Buchanan says her staff will be looking at that data and determining what can be done. "The best protection you have is knowledge and knowing what behaviors and what things put you at risk," said Buchanan.

The rate of acute hepatitis C cases in Tennessee has more than tripled in the last 7 years, and the steadily increasing number of cases may only represent "the tip of the iceberg" of the state's hepatitis C epidemic, according to TDH Commissioner John Dreyzehner, MD, MPH.

"Anyone who has injected drugs and shared needles needs to be tested. Anyone who lives in a household that knows they have hepatitis C and maybe shared toothbrushes or razors needs to be tested," added Dr. Buchanan.

"In addition to reported cases of acute hepatitis C it is estimated that more than 100 000 Tennesseans may be living with chronic hepatitis C and not know it," Dreyzehner said. "Many people have hepatitis C for years, not realizing it, while the viral infection slowly destroys their livers."

There is no vaccine to prevent hepatitis C, so efforts to avoid exposure to infected blood are most important in preventing the spread of the disease. Most of the increase in transmission of hepatitis C in Tennessee is due to the sharing of contaminated needles and syringes among intravenous drug users who are abusing both legal and illegal pain medicines.

Once infected with hepatitis C, some people may recover fully, but most, 70 to 85 percent, will develop long-term infection. Early symptoms of hepatitis C infection can include fatigue, abdominal pain, itching and dark urine. Many people, however, are not aware they have the disease until the virus has already caused liver cancer or liver damage.

Knowing these risk factors and what to look out for is important because there's no vaccine available to prevent it from spreading, just treatments. "Knowing what to do to protect your family members and knowing what to keep yourself healthy is really what we want to get out there right now," said Dr. Buchanan.

It's also suggested that if you were born between 1945 through 1965 to get tested once for hepatitis C, just in case.

The treatment for hepatitis C is currently expensive and a person can later become re-infected. A recent CDC report shows hepatitis C is the most common blood-borne infection in the USA, with approximately 3 million people living with the infection. That report, available online and includes information about a 364 percent increase in hepatitis C in four Appalachian states, including Tennessee, between 2006 and 2012.

[Needle exchange programs and availability of rehabilitation programs are vital in the approach to injection drug use-associated infectious diseases including HIV and hepatitis B as well as hepatitis C. - Mod.LL]

[While treatment is expensive, it is cost-effective compared with other healthcare expenses. (See for example Linas et al. Ann Intern Med. 2015;162(9):619-629. http://annals.org/article.aspx?articleID=2212248) In addition, there is an as-yet unquantified public health benefit in treatment because it reduces the likelihood of transmission to others. - Mod.LM
