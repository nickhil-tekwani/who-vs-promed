Some patients infected with the Ebola virus in Africa have recovered and been sent back home, WHO authorities have noted. The disease is not always fatal if symptoms are noticed early and patients get proper treatment.

The ebolaviruses cause Ebola virus disease [EVD], which has a high fatality rate of up to 90 percent. Outbreaks of EVD mainly happens in the remote villages of western and central Africa. Ebolaviruses are transmitted to humans from wild animals and spread via direct body contact. No specific treatment or medication is available to cure the deadly disease in animals or in humans, nor is there a vaccine. However, a better chance of recovering from the disease exists if it is identified in the early stages and the patient gets proper medical attention.

WHO is working hard to contain the disease, which has recently affected Guinea and Liberia. Many people have already died due to its outbreak. However, reports suggest [state] that some people who were infected in Guinea have recovered and have been allowed to return to their homes.

"Today's discharge [13 Apr 2014] of patients shows that Ebola is not always fatal. Good early supportive care such as hydration, nutrition and appropriate medication can have a positive impact," said Dr. Tom Fletcher, an infectious disease physician with WHO. He provides clinical care to Ebola patients in Conakry, the capital of Guinea.

"After being triaged at the emergency room, people presenting Ebola-like symptoms are directed to the Department of Infectious Disease. After a more detailed exam, patients meeting the case definition [see link below] are referred to this isolation ward," explained Fletcher.

WHO reports that a few individuals who had symptoms of the disease spent 7 days in the isolation ward at Donka national teaching hospital. However, as the patients were showing no symptoms for 3 days and tested negative for the disease, they were released and sent home. WHO and other medical agencies are trying their best to contain the disease with training of workers who track cases of the disease and training in infection control procedures for health care workers. It is important to stop new infections, especially amongst health workers who are treating patients. Since they are in direct contact with the victims in the early stages, they are more prone to get infected themselves.

WHO also suggests collaboration and effective management between WHO, the Ministry of Health in the country, and their partners, with all taking appropriate steps to respond to the deadly outbreak.

Guinea now has 168 Ebola cases with 108 fatalities, and Liberia has 26 cases with 13 deaths.

Guinea's health ministry today [14 Apr 2014] reported 10 more infections compatible with Ebola virus disease (EVD), as hospital officials in the country's capital probe a cluster of cases linked to a funeral, one of which involved a doctor who died from his infection, the World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Office for Africa reported today.

The new EVD cases in Guinea lift the country's outbreak total to 168; 7 new deaths have been reported, pushing the fatality number to 108. So far, 71 of the infections have been confirmed by lab tests.

As of 11 Apr 2014, the most recent illness onsets are 10 Apr 2014, in patients from Conakry, the capital, and Guekedou, an area in the forested area of southeastern Guinea, near where the outbreak is thought to have started. The onset date falls well within the disease's 2-21-day incubation period, a sign that that the outbreak is ongoing.

WHO said doctors at the Donka Hospital isolation facility in Conakry are probing a cluster of patients who had funeral contact with a relative who died on 1 Apr 2014 from a suspected malaria infection. Two of the contacts were admitted on 12 Apr 2014 and tested positive for EVD. An internal medicine doctor who had treated the patient and later died is also part of the transmission chain. The WHO said he had symptoms of EVD but no bleeding and that his postmortem samples were positive for the virus.

So far, 16 healthcare workers are among Guinea's EVD cases, and in 11 of those, the infections were lab-confirmed. The WHO said efforts to promote safe burial practices are ongoing and that in response to the cluster, hospital officials are beefing up surveillance, triage procedures, and infection control.

As of 10 Apr 2014, 11 patients were still hospitalized, and 37 had been discharged. Medical teams are still monitoring 396 contacts.

Liberia's health ministry is reporting one more EVD case as of 11 Apr 2014, raising that country's total to 26, according to the WHO. One more patient has died, raising the number of fatalities there to 13. Among the country's 6 lab-confirmed case-patients, 3 are healthcare workers.

The most recent clinical case was detected on 11 Apr 2014, and the most recent lab-confirmed patient was hospitalized on 4 Apr 2014, so 3 people remain hospitalized, and 5 who tested negative were discharged. Health officials are still monitoring 35 contacts.

In Mali, the total number of suspected cases remains at 6: 3 in Bamako, the country's capital, and 3 in 2 different cities in the Koulikoro region. Tests on samples from the patients are underway at the Pasteur Institute in Senegal, and results are expected shortly, the WHO said. Earlier results on 2 other suspected patients from Mali were negative.

[CNN reports 112 deaths in Guinea on 15 Apr 2014 http://outfront.blogs.cnn.com/2014/04/15/inside-an-ebola-isolation-ward-in-guinea. Nine have survived infection in Guinea so far. The stories of the recovery of a young father and a woman teacher are at: http://www.who.int/features/2014/ebola-survivors/en.

"Case definition recommendations for Ebola or Marburg Virus Diseases as of 9 Apr 2014" may be seen at:
http://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/ebola/ebola-case-definition-contact-en.pdf. They are highly detailed according to circumstances.

The 2nd report mentions the 2-21 day incubation period. It also discusses the case of the doctor who died with EVD symptoms but "no" bleeding. If he'd been an ordinary patient, he'd probably never have been tested. It makes one wonder how many compatible cases -- but without bleeding -- have been missed? Probably quite a few.

Media reports circulated today [14 Apr 2014] saying that cases are decreasing in Guinea and even that the outbreak is under control. This understandable optimism may be premature, given the recent onset dates of the latest hospital admissions, the nearly 400 contacts still under surveillance, the difficulty of tracing other possible contacts in a city the size of Conakry (population around 2 million), and the sometimes long incubation period. Standard practice is that twice the maximum known incubation period -- in the case of Guinea and Liberia, 2x21=42 days -- should elapse without another case before an outbreak can be declared ended.
