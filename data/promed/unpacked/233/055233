H5N1 found in market & amusement park
-------------------------------------
Authorities are stepping up health measures at Cheung Sha Wan
Wholesale Food Market after an oriental magpie robin found there
tested positive for the H5 avian flu virus.

A spokesman for the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation
Department (AFCD) said last night [12 Feb 2008] the bird, a common
species in Hong Kong, was found on Friday [8 Feb 2008].

"In view of the tentative finding, we will conduct a thorough
cleansing and disinfection operation in both the Wholesale Food
Market and the Temporary Wholesale Poultry Market in Cheung Sha Wan
tomorrow," the spokesman said. "We will also step up inspections and
surveillance of the wholesale poultry market."

The AFCD will step up farm inspections and phone farmers to remind
them to strengthen precautionary measures. Letters will be issued to
owners of businesses involving live birds reminding them that proper
precautions must be taken.

A black-crowned night heron found at Ocean Park tested positive for
H5N1 on 28 Jan 2008.

Bird flu resurfaces in Laos
--------------------------------
A fresh outbreak of bird flu among fowls has struck Laos' southern
Luang Namtha province, Lao newspaper on Tuesday [12 Feb 2008] quoted
a local agriculture official as saying.

Some 600 poultry in Nam Ma village, Long district died last week [4-8
Feb 2008], Bounkhouang Khambounheuang, head of the Department of
Livestock and Fisheries under the Ministry of Agriculture and
Forestry, said, noting that their specimens have been tested positive
to bird flu virus strain H5N1.

The department has banned the movement and sale of poultry or eggs in
the village, and has sprayed fowls with disinfectants. All poultry
within one-kilometer radius of the village will be culled.

"We will compensate people for their losses if we have to cull their
birds, according to the rules of the department," he said.
Previous bird flu outbreaks were successfully contained in Vientiane,
and in the 3 provinces of Savannakhet, Champassak and Vientiane last year.

However, the 4 northern provinces of Oudomxay, Bokeo, Luang Prabang
and Phongsaly are at a very high risk of seeing new outbreaks of the
disease, he said. [See map at

[The oriental magpie robin (_Copsychus saularis_) is a common resident
bird in Hong Kong, so was probably flying around in the market, not
caged. That species and the black-crowned night heron (_Nycticorax
nycticorax_) are not particularly migratory in eastern China, but they
may have flown in from the mainland. Also, they could have got the
infection from poultry just as well as vice versa.

[Laos has not experienced avian influenza since March 2007; its last
follow-up report, dated 14 Mar 2007, can be seen at
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/reports/en_fup_0000005029_20070315_155657.pdf>.
The detection of the disease is to be viewed in the context of
seasonal re-emergence. - Mod.AS].
