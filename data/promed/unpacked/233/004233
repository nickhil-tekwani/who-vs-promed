Scotland: Rabies Virus Antibody Detected in Native Bats
-------------------------------------------------------
A study has suggested that 10 percent of one species of bat in Scotland has
been exposed to a rabies virus [European bat lyssavirus type 2 (EBLV2)].
The research was carried out by Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) following
the death of a conservation worker [in 2002] (see references below).
However, SNH has stressed that none of the bats had live virus. Infection
experts said that the risk to the public from bats remained "minimal".
The advice issued following the death of [the conservation worker] in
November 2002 has not been changed. The 56-year-old bat conservation
worker, from Angus, failed to recover after infection by European bat
lyssavirus (EBL), a type of rabies found in several northern European
countries. He was the first person to be killed by rabies in Britain for
100 years. [The press release from SNH
(<http://www.snh.org.uk/news/nw-frame.htm> indicates that European bat
lyssavirus type 2 is the subject of the investigation. - Mod.CP]
[This] death prompted the SNH study, which was carried out during the
summer. The aim was to assess the extent of the disease in bats.
Researchers have been concentrating on Daubenton's bat, which is believed
to be the species responsible for biting [the bat conservation worker].
Researchers tested the blood and saliva of 171 live bats and found that
none of the creatures had the live virus [i.e., the investigators were
unable to isolate infectious virus. - Mod.CP]. However, one in 10 possessed
rabies [EBLV-2] antibodies, which suggested that they had been in contact
with the disease.
Researchers also tested 12 of the more common pipistrelle bats and found no
evidence of rabies antibodies. Professor Colin Galbraith, SNH's director of
science, said: "The interpretation of the preliminary results must be
treated with caution given the relatively small number of bats sampled and
the fact that further field and laboratory work is required to validate the
preliminary findings. We are now undertaking some further work before the
bats move into hibernation, and are gearing up for further studies next
spring. The initial findings from this pilot study will greatly assist the
further development of this work." He said that the presence of antibodies
among the Daubenton's bat appeared to vary from roost to roost.
The advice on how to minimise any risk from bats remains unchanged. "The
public should avoid handling bats if at all possible, and anyone working
with bats should be vaccinated against rabies," he said. Professor Bill
Reilly, of the Scottish Centre for Infection and Environmental Health,
said: "The risk to the public at large from bats remains minimal. There is
nothing in these preliminary findings to suggest any change to the current
advice given to the public, and bat workers in particular. Anyone bitten or
scratched by a bat should immediately wash the wound with soap and water
and seek medical advice. This is the first research work of its type to
take place in Scotland and complements a similar study underway in Lancashire."

Statement from the Bat Conservation Trust
-----------------------------------------
[The Bat Conservation Trust (BCT) has welcomed the pilot study set up to
investigate the extent and frequency of European bat lyssavirus type 2
(EBLV-2) infection of bats in Scotland. The following are extracts from the
BCT news release. - Mod.CP]
The study involved taking blood samples to establish whether bats carry
antibodies that indicate exposure to EBLV-2 virus. Saliva swabs were also
taken to test for live virus. This study confirms that EBLV-2 antibodies
are present in some bats in Scotland; this indicates that there has been
some exposure to the EBLV-2. However, tests for the [infectious] virus
proved negative.
"We were not surprised by these interim results, which indicate that the
virus is present in some Scottish Daubentons bat populations," said Dr
Colin Catto, Director of Conservation for the Bat Conservation Trust.
"Further research would be required to give a more precise indication of
the prevalence of EBLV-2 in Scottish bats." He continued, "However, the
risk to the public remains vanishingly small. These findings do not
affect the Bat Conservation Trusts and government policy, which is that we
continue to advise the general public to avoid handling bats and to seek
medical advice if they are bitten or scratched by a bat."
The Daubentons bat, _Myotis daubentonii_, is a medium-sized bat (between
4.5 cm and 5.5 cm in length). It rarely lives more than 2 km from water,
usually roosting in trees, old mills, tunnels, and under bridges. The
result that between 6 and 19 percent of the Daubentons bats tested
positive for the EBLV-2 antibodies should be interpreted with caution; the
range is so great because blood samples of a number of bats were pooled in
order to provide a large enough sample to be tested.
Some bats in Europe do carry the rabies virus called European bat
lyssavirus (EBLV). This is different from classical rabies, which has never
been found in a bat in Europe. In continental Europe, the recorded
incidence of EBLV is low. There are 2 strains [designated as distinct
species by the ICTV. - Mod.CP]: EBLV-1 and EBLV-2. EBLV-2 has been found
only 10 or so times across the whole of Europe, in pond bats (which are not
found in the UK) and Daubentons bats.
EBLV in bats is very rare in the UK. Over the past 15 years of surveillance
by the Veterinary Laboratories Agency, with up to 200 bats tested each year
for live bat rabies virus, only 2 cases have returned positive results.
Both of these cases, in 1996 and 2002, were Daubentons bats carrying
EBLV-2. The research in Scotland does not affect this statistic, as none of
the bats tested positive for infectious virus, just for the antibodies. The
discovery of EBLV-2 in UK bats does not affect the UKs rabies-free status.
How can a bat have antibodies to a disease that we believe is fatal to bats
without testing positive for the live virus? There appear to be 5 ways in
which this could happen: 1) The bat is infected and is/is not yet showing
rabies symptoms; (2) the bat has recovered from a rabies infection (this is
believed to be unlikely and rare); (3) the bat has been challenged by some
component of the virus that has induced an antibody reaction but did not
result in an infection; (4) the bat has acquired antibodies from its
mothers milk (short-lived benefit); (5) the bat was challenged whilst it
had the acquired antibodies from its mother and then produced its own
antibody defence (the mother having antibodies for reasons 1, 2 or 3).
The risk of catching the virus from a bat is extremely low, for several
reasons: (1) 15 years of surveillance of bats for rabies in the UK has
found only 2 cases; (2) human contact with bats is very rare, even when
they share the same buildings; (3) EBLV is transmitted by the bite of an
infectious bat, there is therefore no risk to people if they do not
approach or handle a bat;(4) bats are not aggressive, although like any
wild animal, they may bite to defend themselves if handled. (Most of the
UKs bats have such small teeth that a bite will not break the skin. A bat
that appears to be baring its teeth is actually scanning you with its
unique method of echolocation -­ building up a picture of its environment
by using a type of sonar, which is mostly inaudible to humans); (5) There
is an effective treatment for those exposed to EBLV; this must be
administered as soon as possible after exposure [post exposure
vaccination - Mod.CP].
Notes on British Bats: There are 16 bat species in the UK, of which 6
species are classified as endangered or rare species, and 6 others are
considered vulnerable. They range in size from the pipistrelle (weighing
just 4 g) to the noctule (up to 40 g). Bats make up 1/3 of the UKs mammal
biodiversity, and 1/4 of the worlds mammal biodiversity (there are almost
1000 species of bat worldwide). Bats are the only mammals that fly. They
are warm-blooded, give birth, and suckle their young. They are very
sociable animals, living together in colonies. Bats are long-lived (some
can live for up to 30 years), are intelligent, highly mobile, and more
agile in flight than most birds. Bats fly and feed in the dark, which they
are able to do by producing a stream of high-pitched calls and listening to
the returning echoes which give a distinct sound picture of the
surroundings. Bats in the UK eat only insects, which they catch in flight
or pick off water, foliage, or the ground. When there are few insects, bats
hibernate in cool parts of buildings, caves or hollow trees.

[The human case of European Bat Lyssavirus (EBLV) 2 infection in Scotland
in November 2002 was confirmed by the Veterinary Laboratories Agency at
that time. This is the 1st confirmed human infection of EBLV-2 in the
United Kingdom (UK), and the 1st human rabies-like infection acquired in
the UK since 1902. This is the 4th confirmed human EBLV infection in the
world and only the 2nd with EBLV-2. The 3 human cases reported previously
occurred in the Ukraine in 1977 and in Finland and Russia in 1985. All 3
previous cases have been in people who had been in close contact with bats.
The 2 cases in the former Soviet Union were EBLV-1 infections in children
who had been bitten by bats. The case in Finland occurred in a bat handler
and was the only previous recorded case of EBLV-2 infection. The clinical
presentations were similar to classical rabies, and all 4 cases were fatal.
Prior to the recent diagnosis of rabies-like infection in Scotland, 2
EBLV-2 infections have been confirmed in bats in the UK, one in Newhaven on
the southern coast of England in 1996 and another in Lancashire in 2002.
Both of these bat rabies cases were in the same species, the Daubenton's
bat. It was thought in 1996 that the bat might have migrated from
continental Europe. However, the finding of the 2002 Lancashire bat case
well away from mainland Europe and of an infection confirmed in a bat
handler is more consistent with EBLV-2 being now endemic in UK bats,
although probably at very low levels.
EBLV-1 and EBLV-2 2 are rabies-like viruses that are carried by
insectivorous bats in Europe. They are from the same family of viruses [the
_Rhabdoviridae_] as cause terrestrial rabies and bat rabies in the Americas
and Australia, and are classified as separate species in the genus
_Lyssavirus_. Between 1977 and 2000, 630 cases of EBLV infection in bats
were reported in Europe, most of which were EBLV-1. They occurred in a
number of countries including Denmark, France, Germany, the Netherlands,
and Spain. Although levels of EBLV-1 infection in bats have increased in
recent years in Europe, EBLV-2 infections have remained rarer than EBLV-1.
The different rabies-like viruses and the different bat species found in
Europe distinguish this region from the Americas, where the risk of rabies
is higher following human contact with bats. All bat-associated rabies
cases in North America have been caused by transmission of genotype 1
rabies virus; i.e., classical rabies virus, and not by rabies-like viruses
similar to EBLV-1 and EBLV-2. EBLV-1 and EBLV-2 do not seem to transmit
readily to other species, hence the rarity of human infections. It is very
rare for other animals to be infected even in countries or regions where
bat rabies occurs, with the total of EBLV-1 infections reported in
terrestrial mammals, comprising 4 Danish sheep and one German stone marten.
There is no appreciable risk of EBLV-2 infection occurring in domestic pets
such as dogs and cats, nor in wild terrestrial mammals in the UK, ensuing
from the isolation of EBLV-2 in UK bats.
Although available rabies vaccine is based on classical (genotype 1)
strains of rabies virus, there is cross-immunity between genotype 1,
genotype 5 (the species EBLV-1), and genotype 6 (the species EBLV-2).
Vaccine failures are extraordinarily rare if the appropriate regimen is
followed. The Netherlands, Denmark, Germany, and Spain have been detecting
EBLV-1 and EBLVV-2 infections (nearly always EBLV-1) in their bat
populations for several years and offer vaccine -- and rabies
immunoglobulin where indicated -- following bat exposures such as bites or
scratches. Over the last 2 decades several hundreds of people in the
Netherlands have been vaccinated with genotype 1 rabies virus vaccines
after a bite of an EBLV-positive bat, but an EBLV infection in a human
being has never been confirmed in the Netherlands. The above information
has been abbreviated in part from a Eurosurveillance Weekly report
