Trichinella outbreak in Kemerovo region
---------------------------------------
In the village Sheregesh Tashtagol 5 people were
hospitalized with suspected trichinellosis. The
patients had all eaten smoked bear meat. The
symptoms included: fever, rash and muscle pain.
Specialists from "Rospotrebnadzor" are now investigating the outbreak.


According to a leading expert in Rospotrebnadzor,
Kemerovo Region, Tatiana Starchenkovoy,
trichinellosis can not only be transmitted from
the bear meat, but also from pork, other wild
animals and dogs. Bear meat is a common source of
trichinella infection in Russia.

In the past year, 17 people have been infected
with trichinellosis, including the hunters who
killed the bear, and their relatives and friends,
who all ate some of the smoked bear meat.

According to the Department for the Protection of
the Fauna, up to 160 bears are shot in the
Kemerovo region every year, and this time of the
year is the bear hunting season. Experts from
Rospotrebnadzor strongly recommend hunters to
submit bear meat to veterinary control, so that
trichinella infected meat can be identified. If
the veterinary inspection finds even one larva of
the parasite, the meat must be destroyed.

[Bear is a well known source of trichinella: both
black and brown bear and also polar bear from
arctic areas. Smoking the meat often fails to
reach temperatures where the trichinella larvae
are killed, and eating trichinella-infected bear
meat which is insufficiently heated is a classic
route of transmission to humans. As said in the
text, veterinary inspection should be performed
before the meat is consumed. - Mod.EP]
