A collaborative effort recently introduced "idsource", a specialized
search tool for identifying the global maze of over 1400 vetted
websites that focus on identification of plant pest insects, diseases
and weeds. The objective is to help users rapidly find trustworthy
websites for screening, detecting, and identifying one or more species
among the multitude that comprise the plant pest universe.

At the website
http://idsource.colostate.edu/cwis438/websites/IDSource/Home.php?WebSiteID=11,
users can access the massive database by alphabetical order, specific
class of disease/pest, or key words. An interactive link is listed for
each item, along with the originating organization, the site's
contents, the nature of the material included (for example, fact
sheets, screening aid, images), individualized notes about the site,
and any user reviews to date.

This "gateway to disease/pest identification" was the joint work of
the United States Department of Agriculture and Colorado State
University. The original concept for idsource arose in 2006, and work
was 1st launched at Australia's University of Queensland.

[This is a very useful tool for both plant pathologists and general
users. Resources specific to nematodes need to be accessed as a
separate list from the other pathogens. For both lists, subsets
according to, for example, region, pathogen or crop groups can be
selected at
