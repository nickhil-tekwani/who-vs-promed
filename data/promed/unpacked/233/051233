Recent studies have shown that [highly pathogenic influenza virus] Asian H5N1 does not cause severe disease in all bird species and some may carry the virus asymptomatically and thus serve as reservoirs for the virus. Thus, the virus could then be carried to novel regions.

Movement of the virus by migratory birds is thought to have led to the novel emergence of H5N1 in Japan in spring of 2008. Also, there are _Anas_ species that use migratory routes between Asia and Alaska. The northern pintail [_Anas acuta_] for example (see numerous papers by the USGS Alaska Science Center [http://alaska.usgs.gov/science/biology/avian_influenza/index.php] on this species' migration patterns between Asia and Alaska and avian influenza genomics).

Lastly, the map provided in the link shows migratory movements away from the northern portion of Alaska near the Arctic Refuge and not the western portion where the Yukon Delta is located and which is also the study site for the paper discussed in this post.

[We thank John for his comment.
It is important to bear in mind that highly pathogenic influenza viruses such as the Asian H5N1 cause severe disease in most bird species. Therefore, only the few species that suffer long subclinical viremia would be able to migrate and carry it to novel regions. In the case of H5N1, these species would mainly be some ducks in the Genus _Anas_ and focus should be placed on them or other Anseriformes. The northern pintail (_Anas acuta_ sp.) has been found to migrate between North America and Asia. - Mod.PMB]

[Regarding the map,

is probably intended to be indicative of the flyway origins and destinations rather than showing actual GPS locations. - Mod.JW]
