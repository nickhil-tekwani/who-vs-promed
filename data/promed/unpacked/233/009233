CEBU Province of the Philippines ranks third in the country in terms of
animals found positive for rabies, according to the Bureau of Animal
Industry of the Department of Agriculture (DA).
The Province has failed to fully implement rabies control measures since
the National Rabies Control program was launched in 1987, said DA rabies
coordinator Alice Utlang.
To date, only 12 of Cebu's 48 towns have passed an ordinance on the
elimination of stray dogs, Utlang told Sun Star Daily yesterday.
Without taking care of stray dogs, the massive anti-rabies vaccination did
not prove entirely effective. Among the 5 cities in Cebu, only Lapu-Lapu
city has yet to create a stray dog ordinance. Utlang said the DA might
soon defer fund releases for vaccination for local government units that
don't have the ordinance. Last year, Cebu city had the most animals found
positive for rabies (44) in Cebu province, according to DA records.
Lapu-Lapu city placed second with 22 cases, followed by Mandaue with 4
cases, Toledo with 3 cases, then Danao with 1 case. Among the towns,
Talisay had the most animals infected with rabies in 1998. Naga reported 6
cases while Consolacion and Cordova tallied 4 cases each.
Utlang, however, admitted the data is inconclusive as there are still a lot
of unreported incidents. She cited a need for a massive information
campaign on responsible pet ownership.
