The Ministry of Agriculture continues its activity to reduce the incidence of rabies. In this framework, the ministry will budget the local authorities in the Valleys region more than NIS 4.5 million [about USD 1.31 million] so that each authority will receive approximately NIS 240 000 [USD 70 000] for 3 months.

The ministry's budget will be used by the authorities to reinforce the professional teams in the area, especially for the hiring of a veterinarian, an inspector, a vehicle for work purposes, and will contract a dog-catcher. This budget will also help raise the percentage of vaccinated animals and, as a result, reduce the number of rabies cases.

As part of their activities, the teams will visit local communities to vaccinate dogs and cats that are not immunized yet and mark the vaccinated animals.

Vaccines will be supplied to the localities for the vaccination of street [in fact, stray] cats, the costs borne by the Ministry [see comment]. Revaccinations of kept dogs and cats and their booster vaccinations are also to be encouraged and subsidised. At the same time, actions are being undertaken to dilute the jackal population by Israel's Nature and National Parks Protection Authority while doubling the number of vaccine baits, increasing their density also outside the rabies-affected area.

The rabies event is considered to be the outcome of the introduction, from neighbouring countries such as Jordan, of a violent virus strain, which is more violent for jackals and foxes [see comment]. As part of the efforts being made to reduce the spread of rabies, the ministry defined the area as a "risk zone," which allows for increased activity in the area of the outbreak without causing irreversible damage to the residents' fabric of life, while raising public awareness to the disease hazard, avoiding contact of humans with wildlife, and maintaining maximal vaccination coverage of pets. The ministry applied to the government for an increased budget for the combat against rabies.

It should be clarified that the control of rabies in Israel includes compulsory annual vaccination of all dogs older than 3 months, while all dogs are electronically identified and registered in the national dogs' registry. The ministry operates an advanced, OIE-recognised [reference laboratory] for rabies, providing Israel's citizens with costless diagnostic services, operative 7/24.

At the same time, the ministry continues to emphasize the importance of animal vaccination and calls upon the public to vaccinate the animals in their possession. Vaccination is a kind of "insurance certificate" to prevent the disease; it protects the animals and the family from the disease. This is true for both domestic animals [pets] and farm animals.

[The recent jackal-related rabies event is without precedent in Israel; during 2017, 47 rabid jackals were lab-confirmed, most of them within the northern valleys, spreading within less than 3 months about 50 km westwards from the Jordanian border to close-to-the-coastline (Mediterranean). This exceeds the total number of lab-confirmed rabid jackals, nationwide, throughout the 15 previous years (2002-2016) combined, totaling 46 cases. Of the 47 cases in jackals during 2017, 37 were recorded during less than 3 months, between 8 Oct and 31 Dec 2017. During the 1st week of 2018, 9 additional rabid jackals have already been lab-confirmed, indicating that the event has not yet peaked. On top of the cases in jackals, 27 rabies cases have been recorded during 2017, within the same region, in other animal species, surprisingly not a single fox among them. Fortunately, and thanks to public awareness combined with the immediate availability of post-exposure vaccines, no human casualties have taken place, so far. Israel's last human rabies case was reported in 2003.

Experts in the OIE-certified rabies reference laboratory of the KVI at Beit-Dagan have reported that most of the recent cases involved young jackals, born after the last vaccine-baits dissemination. They expressed the view that the circulating strain is probably jackal-adapted, requiring a relatively low infective dose. They also indicated that the high environmental temperatures, detrimental to the live vaccine in the baits, may have played some role in the efficacy of the operation. The said assumptions, the strain's genotyping results, and explanation to the absence of cases in foxes, are yet to be visited and definitely clarified. KVI cooperates with FLI (Germany) in the epidemiological and viral investigations of the event.

On top of the wildlife aspects, the Israeli authorities have to cope with the extensive, rabies-susceptible street/stray-cat population: unowned and stray cats are protected by law in Israel. Their total number is assumed to be composed of 7 digits.

Last but not least: the budgetary constraints of the State Veterinary Services (see https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/science/.premium-1.684253), the government's inclination to their privatisation combined with decentralisation, as apparent from the reported ministry's decision to pass responsibilities from the State Veterinary Services to local municipalities, are of grave concern to those caring about public and animal health in Israel. - Mod.AS
