The Regional Directorate of Health (GRS) has recorded an increase of
hantavirus [infection] cases in the region [Minas Gerais state], which
covers 27 municipalities in the greater Triangulo Sur region. The increase
has been seen especially in women, with an increase of close to 20 per cent
in deaths from the disease. In Uberaba, although not considered an outbreak
area, there was one confirmed [case] without recovery [fatal? - Mod.SH] in
2010.

According to Marcia Maria de Souza, in the GRS technical report for 2009,
there were 6 confirmed cases in the region, of which 2 died, and one
reported non fatal case in Uberaba. The index of cases that presented with
complications and did not recover were 33 per cent. Among these cases, just
one woman was infected and the municipalities that registered the greatest
incidence were Ibia and Araxa, both with deaths.

In 2010, the GRS reported 14 confirmed cases of the disease, 3 of whom were
women. 50 per cent died. Araxa was the municipality most affected, with 4
cases and 2 deaths. Uberaba reported only one fatal case. The number of
patients who live in urban areas, go to rural areas for work or recreation,
and become infected [there] is significant, the report stated.

The evaluation of the technical report shows that some factors have
contributed to the increase in cases in the region. "These municipalities
suffer considerably from the rotation of health professionals and
physicians. Because of this, the recommendation is that the professionals
always be alerted to the presence of hantavirus when they arrive in an area
where there have been cases of infection. We ask that the municipalities
train their health workers for the distribution of information about the
disease in rural and urban areas in the region," stated Marcia, who also
added that it is important that the people take preventive measures.

[There are various hantaviruses in Brazil that could cause fatal infections
in Minas Gerais state. Unfortunately, this report does not indicate which
ones were responsible for the cases. The ProMED-mail report of cases in
Brazil dated 23 Feb 2008 (ProMED-mail archive no. 20080223.07412) indicated
that hantaviruses circulating in Mato Grosso included: Laguna Negra, which
has the _Calomys callosus_ rodent host, and Castelo dos Sonhos, which had
previously been found in Para state but without a known host there. Field
research found that, in Mato Grosso, the rodent _Oligoryzomys moojeni_ was
the host of the Castelo dos Sonhos virus.

A brief description of other hantaviruses that occur in Brazil and their
rodent hosts is given in ProMED-mail archive no. 20080702.2020, which
comments that Anajatuba virus is a possible etiological agent of HPS
(hantavirus pulmonary syndrome) in Brazil. Its rodent host is _Oligoryzomys
fornesi_. Araraquara virus infection has also caused HPS in Brazil. Its
rodent host is _Necromys [Bolomys] lasiurus_ . Newly recognized
hantaviruses associated with hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in northern
Brazil: partial genetic characterization of viruses and serologic
implication of likely reservoirs (Vector Borne Zoonotic Dis 5(1): 11-9;
