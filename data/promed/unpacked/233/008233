[ProMED thanks Michael Fraser for this important contribution on recent human cases of avian influenza A/H9N2 in China.

In China, the H9N2 subtype avian influenza (AI) outbreak was first reported in poultry in Guangdong province in 1992. Presently, the H9N2 subtype AI virus has been widely spread in China and has established stable lineages in commercial chicken flocks with endemicity. Despite that the mortality caused by H9N2 generally not exceed 20 percent, it usually leads to respiratory and egg-drop symptom, as well as severe secondary infections, affecting poultry productivity. Therefore, at the current stage, vaccination is still one of the principal strategies to control H9N2 AI in China, apart from biosecurity measures (https://veterinaryresearch.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13567-017-0453-2).

In 2018 there were 7 human cases of avian influenza A(H9N2) reported from China to WHO and 6 cases thus far in 2019. A total of 28 cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H9N2) in China have been reported since December 2015 [WHO/WPRO].

The H9N2 viruses have shown sporadic transmission to humans and are donors of internal genes to other potentially pandemic sub-types such as A/H5N1 and A/H7N9 avian influenza viruses.

According to the WHO Risk Assessment of human infection with avian influenza A virus (dated 24 Jun 2019; https://www.who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/Influenza_Summary_IRA_HA_interface_24_06_2019.pdf): The overall public health risk from currently known influenza viruses at the human-animal interface has not changed, as further human infections with viruses of animal origin are expected, and the likelihood of sustained human-to-human transmission of these viruses remains low. - Mod.UBA

H9N2 influenza A viruses have become globally widespread in poultry over the last 2 decades and represent a genuine threat, both to the global poultry industry and also to humans, through their high rates of zoonotic infection and pandemic potential. Since they have an IVPI (intravenous pathogenicity index, in susceptible 6-week-old chickens) below 1.2, and are non-H5 and non-H7, according to OIE criteria they are not defined as 'avian influenza' and are not notifiable.

H9N2 viruses are generally hyperendemic in affected countries and have been found in poultry in many new regions in recent years. Due to the economic damage caused by enzootic H9N2 avian influenza virus (AIV), many countries including China, Israel, South Korea, Morocco, Pakistan, Egypt, Iran, and UAE have adopted vaccination at either a national or local level as a key approach for preventing H9N2 disease in poultry.

The most common vaccines in use are traditional inactivated vaccines, similar to those used in human seasonal vaccines. Unlike human vaccines, H9N2 AIV vaccines are generally not as regularly assessed for their efficacy against antigenically drifted viruses and consequently are less often updated. Therefore, the virus may continue to infect and cause disease in vaccinated poultry with tentative evidence suggesting that suboptimal use of vaccination may be driving antigenic drift and/or clade replacement, and theoretically zoonotic potential and pathogenicity.

A recent review (1), from which some of the above has been extracted, examines the current global spread of H9N2 avian influenza viruses as well as their host range, tropism, transmission routes, and the risk posed by these viruses to human health. The review includes a map presenting the phylogeographic range of poultry-adapted H9N2 lineages, such as BJ94, G1-W, G1-E, Y439, and their mixtures, as well as a table presenting data from the 48 countries in which the virus has been identified so far.
