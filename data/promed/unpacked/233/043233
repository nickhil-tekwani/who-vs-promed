The Minnesota Department of Health reported Monday [21 Mar 2011] that
a 7-month-old had the measles, bringing the total in this outbreak to
7. Three cases involve Somali children who are old enough to receive
the measles vaccine but haven't. Another 3 involve infants who are too
young to receive the vaccine.

The outbreak probably started with an infant who returned from Kenya
last month [February 2011], the Health Department said. Health
officials are hoping more parents in the Somali community will seek
shots after a forum Saturday [19 Mar 2011] to address their concerns
about vaccine safety.

The number of measles cases in Minnesota, all of them in Hennepin
County, has grown to 9. Four of the 9 Hennepin County cases are among
children too young for vaccination. Four more are among people who
were not vaccinated. Hennepin County public health officials are
holding measles vaccination clinics, but so far, they say, attendance
is poor.

"We were really trying to target the Somali community and have not
been effective in getting our message out," said Allain Hankey, an
epidemiologist with the Hennepin County public health department.
Somali children account for 5 of the 9 measles cases in Minnesota,
including the 2 identified late Monday [21 Mar 2011].

Health officials are concerned about lower rates of vaccination in
that community. But Hankey said she's worried about the broader
decline in the number of children in Hennepin County with
vaccinations. "The overall vaccination rate at age 2 is about 85
percent right now," Hankey said. "We ought to be well over 90 percent
in our community."

Lynfield, who is also a pediatrician, said some Somalis fear
vaccinations are linked to autism, a connection that she said has been
debunked. Other Minnesotans, she said, refuse to have their children
vaccinated for other reasons, including exposure to foreign proteins.
"The reality is their children are exposed to lots of foreign
substances every day," she said. "The reason we use vaccines is they
are a safe way of exposing the child to something that is similar to
the infectious agent, so that if the child does get exposed to the
infectious agent, they now have a stronger response to it."

The 9 cases of measles in Minnesota so far this month [March 2011],
Lynfield said, are more than the reported number of cases in the past
5 years combined. She said measles was mostly contained in years past
because of widespread immunity among state residents. "Unfortunately
this time around, it came in a population that did not have a high
amount of immunity," Lynfield said. "There was the opportunity for
measles virus to circulate and cause more infections. It is very, very
contagious." Lynfield said people without immunity who are exposed to
measles have a 90 percent chance of infection. Measles is rarely
fatal, but can cause complications, including pneumonia.

Lynfield said she expects the number of cases to rise. Hennepin
County public health officials are scheduling another measles
vaccination clinic for Saturday [26 Mar 2011] at Children's Hospital
in Minneapolis.

The Minnesota measles outbreak that began with an unvaccinated child
who had traveled to Kenya has now grown to 11 confirmed cases.
According to the Minnesota Department of Health, among the cases were
4 children who were too young to be vaccinated. Most of the others
were unvaccinated too, although they were old enough to have gotten
the MMR vaccine. Fear of a link between MMR and autism among many of
the Somali immigrants who are affected by this measles outbreak in
Minnesota is thought to account for low vaccine rates.

Although they aren't getting as much attention [as the Minnesota
outbreak], there are also other reports of measles cases [in the
USA]:

- 2 new measles cases in New York City that were diagnosed in
residents that had traveled to Romania and India

- 2 new measles cases in Tennessee

- one measles case in California which involved a 27-year-old who
got measles while traveling to the Philippines and Thailand

In addition to highlighting the importance of the MMR vaccine for
children, these measles cases are a good reminder for everyone to make
sure their immunizations are up-to-date before traveling out of the
country.

Fortunately, there have been no new measles cases in the measles
outbreak in Boston and Clark County, Washington [see: Measles update
2011 (05) 20110322.0898, and earlier].

The HPA [Health Protection Agency] said the majority of cases had
been reported among students in the city. Health chiefs have said they
are concerned about an outbreak of measles in Leeds, the 1st confirmed
cases in the city since 2009.

The Health Protection Agency (HPA) said 15 confirmed cases and 5
suspected cases had been reported since February [2011]. The agency
said the majority of cases were students, indicating the disease was
circulating within the city's student community. Doctors are urging
those not vaccinated to contact their GP. The HPA said all individuals
concerned were recovering well, and health professionals had been
working to ensure any close contacts of the cases had been
identified.

Dr Mike Gent, consultant in communicable disease control at West
Yorkshire Health Protection Unit, said: "Measles can be a very
dangerous illness, and these recent cases are a cause for concern, as
they are the 1st confirmed cases we have seen in Leeds since 2009.
"Prior to vaccination, measles was most common among children aged one
to 4 years old. However, the recent cases in adults demonstrate that
anyone of any age who has not been vaccinated against measles is at
risk from the disease." Dr Simon Balmer, public health consultant for
NHS Leeds, urged people to get immunised with the MMR vaccine. "It is
never too late for children and young adults to get immunised with the
MMR vaccine," he said.

A 2nd measles case has been confirmed on the Gold Coast, following
the 1st outbreak at the end of February 2011. Queensland Health is
urging anyone who was at the Westfield Helensvale shopping centre from
10 to 18 Mar 2011 to be alert for symptoms after the confirmation of
measles in a person working at the centre during this period. Gold
Coast Public Health medical officer, Dr Don Staines, said the person
had no history of overseas or interstate travel, and no obvious link
to the 1st case reported on the Gold Coast.

Anyone who develops measles-like symptoms should contact their GP.
"It's very important to call the medical practice 1st to say you could
have measles, so that staff can take precautions to avoid spreading
the disease to others," he said. Dr Staines said symptoms usually
started about 10 days after infection. "Measles can be very
distressing for those affected, and complications can include
pneumonia or encephalitis (inflammation of the brain) and occasionally
death," he said. "Queensland Health will continue to actively
investigate this case and do whatever it can to prevent further
transmission."

Source: Relief Web, Medecins Sans Frontieres press release [edited]

Over the past 6 months, a measles epidemic has been sweeping through
the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF)
is raising the alarm and calling for concerted action to halt the
spread of the disease. "The measles epidemic is spiraling out of
control," says Gael Hankenne, MSF Head of Mission in the DRC. "Since
September 2010, we have vaccinated more than 1.5 million children in
response to the crisis. But the disease is spreading like wildfire.
All parties involved in health in the DRC must now make this epidemic
a national priority. Since September 2010, we have counted more than
21 000 measles cases in the DRC," says Hankenne. "Concerted action
needs to happen right now."

The treatment and vaccination needs are huge, and the requirements in
terms of human resources, finances and logistical capacity mean that
MSF cannot be the only organisation providing a hands-on response
throughout the entire country. "We are asking the Ministry of Health
to launch a response immediately to outbreaks that occur in the other
provinces or in any new health zone that is affected," says Geza
Harzi, MSF Head of Mission in Katanga. "At the same time, we are
asking international donors and institutions, and health organisations
with activities in the DRC -- particularly UN agencies (such as the
WHO and UNICEF) and NGOs -- to take action immediately. We request
that they either release emergency funding or take hands-on action as
part of the epidemic response. If this international response not
rapid, it will be impossible to check the spread of measles in the
DRC."

MSF is expanding its emergency response in 3 provinces: Tshikapa in
Kasai Occidental province, at Fizi in South-Kivu province, and at
Kolwezi and Likasi in Katanga province. More than a million children
will be protected by these emergency vaccinations. Over the past
months, MSF has provided a complete emergency response (treatment,
vaccination and epidemiology) in Katanga, Kasai Occidental and
South-Kivu. New outbreaks have flared up in Bandundu, Kasai Oriental
and Maniema provinces. The epidemic is moving north fast.

Measles is an extremely contagious disease that can cause medical
complications such as pneumonia, malnutrition, severe dehydration, ear
infections and eye infections that can lead to blindness. Mortality
rates vary considerably depending on the context. When a population
has not been vaccinated, measles can kill between 1-15 percent of
afflicted children. Among vulnerable groups (such as people who have
been displaced or are malnourished), the mortality rate can rise to 25
percent if people have limited access to health care, as is the case
in many health zones in the DRC.

[The statistics contained in this press release demonstrate the
severity of measles virus infection, with mortalities up to 25 percent
in undernourished communities in the absence of protection by
vaccination. The tragedy is compounded by the fact that an effective
and secure vaccine is available for prevention of measles virus
infection.
