[1] Massachusetts: State DPH urges measles vaccination as suspected cases triple
Date: 2 May 2019

https://www.masslive.com/news/2019/05/measles-vaccination-urged-as-massachusetts-suspected-cases-triple.html


More than 60 suspected cases of measles, with one confirmed, have been investigated by the Massachusetts Department of Health to date this year [2019]. The DPH said in comparison it investigated 21 suspect cases during the same period last year and none were confirmed measles.

The largest national number of confirmed measles cases in 25 years has been reported this year [2019] to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The 704 cases of measles in 22 states is the largest number since the highly contagious disease was considered eliminated in the United States in 2000 as a result of vaccination. The count is nearly double the total of confirmed cases reported nationally last year.

Contributing factors in a country where overall immunization is high include parental fears over vaccination, pockets of low immunity and global travel at a time of large outbreaks of measles in both developed and developing countries.

As of 29 Apr 2019, there have been 423 confirmed cases of measles in Brooklyn and Queens since October 2018. Most of these cases have involved members of the Orthodox Jewish community.

The initial child with measles was unvaccinated and acquired measles on a visit to Israel, where a large outbreak of the disease is occurring. Since then, there have been additional people from Brooklyn and Queens who were unvaccinated and acquired measles while in Israel. People who did not travel were also infected in Brooklyn or Rockland County.

A woman who went to the midnight showing of "Avengers: Endgame" at an Orange County movie theater last week was diagnosed with measles, and now health officials are warning others in the crowd that they may have been exposed.

The Placentia woman in her 20s, who had just returned from an international trip, was infected with measles when she went to see the midnight showing of the finale in the Avengers saga.

The Orange County Health Care agency said the woman visited the AMC Theater in Fullerton Thu 25 Apr 2019, and other moviegoers may have been exposed from 11 p.m. in the evening until 4 a.m.

An Orange County infant who was too young to be vaccinated is hospitalized with measles, OC health officials announced Saturday [4 May 2019]. That latest case became public hours after UC Irvine officials said a graduate student who spent time on campus this week had also been confirmed to have the highly-contagious disease.

The student, identified as a man who lives in Long Beach, did not need hospitalization and is currently quarantined at his home, officials said. Orange County health officials said he had been vaccinated and had no history of international travel.

Long Beach City Health Officer Dr. Anissa Davis said the man is among some 3% of people who still contract measles despite being vaccinated. The good news is that those people typically suffer less severe symptoms and also are not as contagious to others.

The man had spent extensive time in public before his diagnosis, including at a movie theatre, grocery stores and wine bars in Long Beach, according to information released by health officials [details at URL above].

OC health officials said the baby has "no history of international travel." They did not give a specific age for the infant, who was cared for at Children's Hospital of Orange County emergency department.

[6] CIDRAP: weekly update

http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2019/04/us-measles-cases-top-700-states-grapple-9-outbreaks


After the United States set a post-elimination-era record in measles cases last week, infections continue to pile up, and with 78 cases for the past week, the country has now reached 704 total, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said today [29 Apr 2019].

Thirteen outbreaks -- defined as 3 or more related cases -- have now been reported in 2019 so far, and account for 94% of all cases. Nine outbreaks are currently active, up from 6 reported the previous week. The CDC today [29 Apr 2019] spelled out all the details and implications of this year's [2019] surge in cases in an early report in Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) and in its weekly case update.

In the 2 reports, the CDC said the 78 new cases lift the nation's total so far this year [2019] -- which isn't even half over -- to 704 cases in 22 states as of 26 Apr 2019.

Officials are now eyeing 1994 and its 963 case count. That's the year the federally funded Vaccines for Children program began, which the CDC said led to very stable rates of people vaccinated against the disease. It took 6 more years for measles elimination to be declared in the United States, meaning transmission was stopped and that the disease was no longer considered endemic in the country.

The country could top 1994 totals in the coming months at the current pace. In 1993, officials recorded 312 cases, according to the CDC, but more than 2000 infections in 1992.

The CDC said 6 of the 13 outbreaks have been linked to under-immunized close-knit communities, which make up 88% of all cases. The outbreak areas include New York City and 12 states: California, Connecticut, Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Texas, and Washington.

California currently has 3 outbreaks linked to international travelers, and of the 38 confirmed cases in the state as of 24 Apr 2019, 25 reflect outbreak cases, according to the California Department of Public Health (CDPH). The outbreak locations in California are the Butte County area, Los Angeles County, and Sacramento County.

Meanwhile, an outbreak centered in New York City's Orthodox Jewish community has topped 400 cases, with 33 new cases boosting the total to 423 cases, according to the latest update from NYC Health.

Of the 704 US patients, 503 (71%) weren't vaccinated, 76 (11%) had at least one dose of measles-containing vaccine, and the vaccination status of 125 (18%) is unknown. Fully 689 (98%) of the infections involved US residents. So far, 66 of people with measles (9%) have been hospitalized, and 24 (3%) had pneumonia. No deaths or cases of encephalitis -- a potentially fatal complication -- have been reported.

There have been 44 cases imported from a wide range of countries, 34 of which involved US citizens. The vast majority of imported cases originated in the Philippines, Ukraine, Israel, Thailand, Viet Nam, and Germany.

In its MMWR report, the CDC warned that unvaccinated US residents who travel abroad are at risk for getting sick with measles and that close-knit communities that have low vaccination rates are at risk for sustained outbreaks.

In a statement today [29 Apr 2019], Save the Children -- a London-based nongovernmental organization -- said that its Children's Emergency Health Unit has already responded to 3 measles outbreaks this year [2019] -- in South Sudan, Kenya, and Madagascar -- more than in any previous year.

The group said its campaign in Madagascar that focused on the country's northeast Sava region faced unique challenges, including remote locations that required a 2-day trek through mountainous and forested regions with vaccines and materials transported by canoes and carried by human porters.

Though most parents were eager to have their children vaccinated, teams faced some community resistance, but local leaders took an active role in informing people about the campaign. Save the Children vaccinated more than 180 000 children in 2 districts in Madagascar, and the nonprofit added that the health ministry is reporting a decline in the number of new cases. So far, Madagascar has reported 118 000 measles cases, 1700 of them fatal.

[9] St. Lucia: cruise ship

A cruise ship quarantined for a reported case of measles left the Caribbean island of St. Lucia late on Thu [2 May 2019] after health officials provided 100 doses of vaccine to the ship, media reports said.

The Church of Scientology cruise ship was confined in port this week by island health officials after the highly contagious disease was detected on board.

CNN reported the ship had left St. Lucia, and online ship traffic data showed that the vessel was underway and headed for the island of Curacao.

One case of measles had been confirmed on the ship docked in port near the capital of Castries since Tuesday [30 Apr 2019], Dr. Merlene Frederick-James, St. Lucia's chief medical officer, said in a video statement.

"The confirmed case as well as other crew members are presently stable, but remain under surveillance by the ship's doctor," she said, noting that the incubation period of measles is 10-12 days before symptoms appear.

NBC News reported that nearly 300 passengers and crew were aboard the vessel, with one female crew member diagnosed with measles.

According to the church's website, Scientologists use prescription drugs and are treated by medical doctors, but the church has not expressed a specific position on vaccinations. In a statement to The Hollywood Reporter in 2016, the church said it "takes no position one way or the other on this issue," despite several high-profile celebrities in the church speaking out against vaccines. - Mod.LK]

Authorities worry that people aboard the ship might have been exposed after a female crew member was diagnosed with measles after coming back from Europe.

Authorities in Curacao boarded a ship that arrived in the Dutch Caribbean island under quarantine, to start vaccinating people to prevent a measles outbreak.

Health officials said only those who already have been vaccinated or have previously had measles will be free to leave the 440-foot (134-meter) ship, Freewinds, which reportedly belongs to the Church of Scientology.

Curacao epidemiologist Dr. Izzy Gerstenbluth told The Associated Press that a small team is assessing more than 300 people aboard the ship, and that the process might take more than a day.

Ukraine has the most measles cases in the world, with more than 53 000 reported in the last year.

Here & Now's Peter O'Dowd speaks with UNICEF's Dr. Kateryna Bulavinova, who is working on a vaccination effort in Ukraine. She says part of the problem is that many medical schools are providing inaccurate information about vaccines to young doctors, who then pass that information on to patients.

Two workers at Narita airport are confirmed to have been infected with measles, the local government said Tue [30 Apr 2019], warning about the risk of possible exposure to the highly contagious virus at one of the busiest airports in Japan.

The local government of Chiba Prefecture, where the airport is located, said a male worker in his 30s fell ill with a fever of 39 C [102 F] on Tue 30 Apr 2019 last week.

Another worker, a teenage woman, became sick on 20 Apr 2019 but did not go into work and is not believed to have spread the virus.

Japan was declared measles-free by the World Health Organization in 2015, but over 200 cases of infection have been reported this year [2019] after an outbreak of the disease in Okinawa Prefecture and some other regions last year [2018].

Medical experts say infections increased in line with a surge in foreign tourists.

Narita International Airport employs about 43 000 people and services approximately 118 000 customers daily. The airport had been experiencing a rush of travelers flying overseas ahead of the 10-day Golden Week holiday.

Date: Wed 1 May 2019

A growing measles outbreak in the Philippines is being fueled by vaccine hesitancy that originated in the Dengvaxia vaccine controversy, which has embroiled that nation for the last 3 years.

According to a report today [1 May 2019] from UNICEF and the World Health Organization (WHO), there have now been 31 056 measles cases, including 415 deaths (case-fatality rate, 1.34%) reported in the Philippines since 1 Jan 2019, which is 368% more cases than the number recorded during the same period last year [2018].

The outbreak is connected to low vaccine uptake, a problem that has worsened after Dengvaxia, Sanofi Pasteur's dengue vaccine, was widely administered to school-age children in the Philippines despite evidence the vaccine could lead to severe dengue cases in some recipients.

Last year [2018], the Philippines recorded 20 827 measles cases and 199 deaths. The outbreak in the Philippines has also been connected to US measles cases.

"Outbreak and supplementary immunization activities in 2018 were ineffective in addressing the outbreak as the immunization activity was met with increased vaccine hesitancy due to the dengue vaccine controversy," the report said.

Two weeks ago, the World Health Organization published an alarming report that measles cases across the world rose 300 percent in the 1st 3 months of 2019 compared to the same period last year [2018].

"While this data is provisional and not yet complete, it indicates a clear trend," said the United Nations health agency.

Nepal has made significant strides in vaccination, but measles outbreaks in some districts have become a cause for concern.

Multiple officials the Post spoke to said measles outbreaks were reported in Morang, Dang and Kapilvastu districts in April 2019 alone.

Measles was endemic in Nepal, and an average 90 000 cases were recorded every year from 1994 to 2004. Routine measles vaccination began in the country in 1979 with 3 districts. The campaign was expanded nationwide after 10 years.

Over 13 000 children aged 9 months-15 years in disease-hit areas are being immunised, officials say.

[16] Measles: Increasing Vaccine Uptake Correlates With Decreasing Disease Rates - Background
Source: GIDEON (Global Infectious Disease Epidemiology Network) [edited]
https://protect2.fireeye.com/url?k=10c8833a-4ceb64e1-10ca7a0f-0cc47aa8c6e0-d34b947f4c9ddfea&u=https://www.gideononline.com/2019/05/02/measles-correlation-of-vaccine-uptake-with-disease-rates/


The following is a country-by-country analysis of measles reporting trends vs. vaccine uptake. For purposes of consistency, incidence data and population statistics used to calculate rates per 100 000 are limited to those published by the World Health Organization (WHO). Resultant graphs were generated by Gideon and abstracted from the Gideon e-book series [1,2]. Estimates of true vaccination update are those published by WHO, in most cases available only since 1980. Data published by the countries themselves were not used, to avoid possible bias or inconsistency when comparing data among countries. Historical disease data which precede 1980 have been appended to graphs to further appreciate the impact of vaccination.

See A-to-Z 135 individual country graphs at
https://protect2.fireeye.com/url?k=10c8833a-4ceb64e1-10ca7a0f-0cc47aa8c6e0-d34b947f4c9ddfea&u=https://www.gideononline.com/2019/05/02/measles-correlation-of-vaccine-uptake-with-disease-rates/.

The reader will note that in virtually all cases, the presumed impact of vaccine uptake on disease incidence occurs when vaccine uptake exceeds 80%, and again when rates increase beyond 90%. As such, the few countries which have not achieved 80% uptake, or have consistently reported over 90% uptake since 1980 are excluded. Graphs are not included for countries for which data are not reported or reported only sporadically.

Individual graphs for 135 countries are presented in alphabetical order. In 127 (94%) of these, a clear relationship seems to exist between increasing vaccine uptake and decreasing rates of measles. In 8 cases, temporary "spikes" in disease incidence were reported during years of high vaccine uptake: Japan, Jordan, Republic of Korea, Seychelles, Solomon Islands, South Africa, Sri Lanka and Syria.

I have not attempted to perform a statistical analysis of this phenomenon and cannot say with certainty that a confounding (3rd) factor does not exist. Nevertheless, these graphs appear to indicate a favorable effect of vaccination on measles incidence.

[17] Return of measles

The return of the measles: are we going backward?
-------------------------------
citation. Catharine I. Paules et al. Measles in 2019 -- Going Backward. 2019. NJEM. DOI: 10.1056/NEJMp1905099.

Excerpts:
Measles vaccination has prevented an estimated 21 million deaths worldwide since 2000. (3) Despite these substantial gains, global elimination goals have not been met, and previous strides are now being threatened by a 31% increase in the number of measles cases reported globally between 2016 and 2017.(3) The growing number of travel-related infections and local outbreaks in the United States reflects this alarming trend, yet the U.S. situation is dwarfed by outbreaks elsewhere in the world. For example, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported 117 075 measles cases and 1205 deaths in Madagascar between early October 2018 and early April 2019. Venezuela is also experiencing a large-scale epidemic, with endemic measles transmission now reestablished in a country where it had previously been eliminated. (3) In Europe, the number of reported cases in 2018 was triple that in 2017 and 15 times that in 2016. (4) In addition, it is likely that endemic measles has now been reestablished in several European countries where transmission had previously been interrupted. (3)

Unlike many infectious diseases, measles is a public health problem with a clear scientific solution. Measles vaccination is highly effective and safe. Each complication or death related to measles is a preventable tragedy that could have been avoided through vaccination. The recent upsurge in U.S. measles cases, including the worrisome number seen thus far in 2019, represents an alarming step backward. If this trend is not reversed, measles may rebound in full force in both the United States and other countries and regions where it had been eliminated. Promoting measles vaccination is a societal responsibility, with the ultimate goal of global elimination and eradication, relegating measles to the history books.

[18] Explosive US outbreak
Date: Tue 30 Apr 2019
Source: Vox [abridged, edited]
https://www.vox.com/2019/4/30/18523203/measles-outbreak-2019-vaccines-policy


There's one big reason measles is spreading: It's way too easy to avoid vaccines.

Measles is spreading quickly in several parts of the country, with more than 700 cases reported in 22 states. That's already more cases than in any other year since 1994, and it's only April 2019.

But here's the most frustrating part: This is all entirely preventable. By 2000, thanks to the highly effective measles vaccine, the virus was declared eliminated in the US. It's absurd that outbreaks have reappeared.

Yet there's a major reason why: Too many states make it way too easy for parents to avoid vaccines on behalf of their kids. In other words, measles is making a comeback because of a policy failure.

Most of the people with measles right now weren't immunized from the virus. And many live in places that permit a variety of nonmedical (religious or philosophical) exemptions from vaccines.

The outbreaks here have mostly started like this: An un-immunized American picks up the virus while traveling in a country where measles is spreading more broadly and then brings it back to their under-vaccinated, tight-knit community in the US. (The top 3 countries where measles cases in the US originated were Ukraine, Israel, and the Philippines.)

Had these travelers and their families been vaccinated, we wouldn't have measles here. And when you couple the ease of opting out of vaccines with the fact that there's a greater global risk of catching measles elsewhere, it's not hard to see why the disease is now roaring back.

To understand why it can be easy to opt out of vaccines, you need to understand our national system of vaccine requirements. It's best understood as an exercise in federalism: There's a ton of variation across the country when it comes to individual immunization mandates.

It was actually measles outbreaks in the 1960s that inspired a push to have states require children to get inoculated before starting kindergarten. By the 1980s, all states had mandatory immunization laws in place. The idea behind these laws was simple: Near-universal vaccinations sustain herd immunity.

But even though every state has legislation requiring vaccines for students entering school, almost all of them allow exemptions for people with religious beliefs against immunizations, and 17 states currently grant philosophical exemptions for those opposed to vaccines because of personal or moral beliefs (the exceptions are Mississippi, California, and West Virginia, which have the strictest vaccine laws in the nation, allowing only medical exemptions).

In these places, opting out can mean simply listening to a doctor or health official explain the benefits of vaccination or getting a signed statement about your religious beliefs notarized. In 45 states, even without an exemption, kids can be granted "conditional entrance" to school on the promise that they will be vaccinated, but schools don't always bother to follow up.

We have plenty of evidence, spanning more than a decade, to show that when you make it easier for parents to opt out of shots, the rates of vaccine exemptions tend to be higher. The most recent 2018 analysis of US vaccine policies found that states allowing both religious and philosophical exemptions -- as 17 states currently do -- were associated with a 2.3 percent decrease in measles-mumps-rubella vaccine rates and a 1.5 percent increase in both total exemptions and nonmedical exemptions.

And many of the states with more permissive vaccine exemption policies -- such as New York, Washington, and Michigan -- are where we're seeing outbreaks today. California, home to one of the fastest-growing outbreaks right now, is an exception. In 2015, the state abolished nonmedical exemptions, but the vaccine mandate applied to school-age kids, and the outbreaks there have mostly affected adults. So even closing vaccine loopholes after generations of permissiveness won't necessarily capture everyone who's unvaccinated.

Another thing the measles outbreaks have in common: 88 percent of all cases have involved outbreaks in what the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention calls "close-knit communities," or people of a similar background who share values and beliefs and interact often.

This phenomenon isn't specific to one religion or cultural background. This year [2019], measles has spread among Orthodox Jews in New York and the Slavic community in Washington. In years past, we've seen explosive outbreaks among the Amish in Ohio and Somali Americans in Minnesota.

Tight-knit communities have become an urgent focus of health departments across the country, Nancy Messonnier, the director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, told Vox earlier this year [2019]. When measles strikes, outbreaks in these groups tend to be "explosive" and more difficult to control.

While the reasons for vaccine skepticism may be different in each of these communities, the groups themselves have a lot in common. They're cohesive and conservative. They appear to trust each other more than outsiders. They also speak the same languages and read or watch the same news. This means it's easy for anti-vaccine rhetoric to spread, and viruses too. "We think these communities are more alike," Messonnier added, and their insularity helps "outbreaks escalate."

So more than Facebook, real-life social networks seem to turbocharge the spread of anti-vaccine views, and along with them viruses like measles. But again, we'd have little issue in these communities if it wasn't so easy to opt out of vaccines.

In the current outbreak, states and cities have been taking extraordinary measures to get people vaccinated, from fining those who opt out to mandating vaccines where the virus is spreading and closing down grade schools or quarantining students. Washington's state senate also passed a bill to eliminate personal and philosophical exemptions for the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine (it still needs to be signed into law).

But it's not clear these crackdowns amid ongoing outbreaks will help. They're reactive and heavy-headed, and they might backfire, causing the skeptics of vaccines to dig in. Especially when it comes to tight-knit communities, public health officials need to build trust over years, and stick around long after outbreaks are over, to get communities and community leaders on their side.

States also need to find ways to simply make it more inconvenient to opt out by cracking down on things like the conditional entry to school, or introducing exemptions with regular renewals. These measures are subtler than mandates or fines and may be more effective.

States should move fast. The percentage of people seeking nonmedical exemptions -- while still small -- has also been creeping upward, from 1.1 percent in 2009-2010 to 2.2 percent by 2017-2018. Outbreaks in recent years have also been getting larger, Emory vaccine researcher Saad Omer told Vox earlier this year [2019]. "That's the canary in the coal mine for me."

In New York, the state with the largest number of measles cases, the virus has been on the move since last September [2018], mostly among Orthodox Jews, some of whom reject vaccines because of unfounded safety concerns. That outbreak sparked another in Detroit. In Washington State, where another big outbreak just ended, mistrust of health officials and pharmaceutical companies drove parents to opt out. There are also measles clusters in New Jersey, Michigan, Maryland, and California, among other states.

These outbreaks will cost states and the federal government millions of dollars to contain. They'll distract from other important public health programs. Most importantly, they'll put people who can't be immunized -- newborn babies, kids with vaccine allergies -- at risk.

[19] Anti-vaccination messages escalate

Doctors worry as anti-vaccination messages escalate from social media misinformation to personal threats

[excerpt:]
As anti-vaccination groups fight back against public health campaigns to promote immunization in the face of measles outbreaks, some Canadian doctors say the battle has escalated beyond social media platforms to personal threats and attacks.

"The pitchforks are coming out," said Dr. Anna Wolak, a family physician in Vancouver who has publicly spoken out on social media about the importance of vaccination, both as a doctor and the mother of 3 children.

Although most patients and many people in the community have been supportive, Wolak said she has also been subjected to furious comments, both in person and through social media.

Anti-vaccination groups promote false claims linking vaccines to childhood illnesses or injury.
