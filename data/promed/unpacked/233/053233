The Regional Secretariat of Health confirmed that the death of a patient this past Tuesday [4 Jan 2011] in the Puerto Montt Base Hospital was due to [a] hantavirus [infection]. The man was a 43 year old farmer who was cutting firewood with his 55 year old brother in the rural area of Caracol, Los Muermos.

According to the El Llanquihue newspaper, confirmation of this case was received trough the Epidemiological Bulletin on Hantavirus [infection] of the Ministry of Health, which reports the situation as of 7 Jan 2011.

[This is confirmation of the earlier case reported in ProMED-mail archive no 20110106.0077 on 6 Jan 2011. The specific hantavirus involved in this case was not mentioned but it was very likely Andes virus. As noted in the comment in the earlier report of this case, Los Muermos is within the ecosystem where Andes hantavirus is endemic in its rodent host, the long-tailed pygmy rice rat.

An image of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_), the sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus, can be seen at <http://www.bios.niu.edu/frayjorge/rod6.jpg>.
