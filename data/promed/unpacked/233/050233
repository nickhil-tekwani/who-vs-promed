The Democratic Republic of the Congo has declared an outbreak of meningitis in the north-eastern Tshopo Province where 261 suspected cases and 129 deaths--a high case fatality ratio of 50% -- have been reported.

Confirmatory tests carried out by the Institut Pasteur in Paris detected _Neisseria meningitidis_ -- one of the most frequent types of bacterial meningitis with the potential to cause large epidemics.

The health authorities have deployed an initial emergency team, and with the support of the World Health Organization (WHO), efforts are underway to quickly ramp up the response. A crisis response committee has been set up in Banalia, the community affected by the outbreak, as well as in Kisangani, the capital of Tshopo, to accelerate the outbreak control efforts. WHO has provided medical supplies in Banalia and plans to deploy more experts and resources.

"Meningitis is a serious infection and a major public health challenge. We are moving fast, delivering medicines, and deploying experts to support the government's efforts to bring the outbreak under control in the shortest possible time," said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa.

More than 100 patients are already receiving treatment at home and in health centres in Banalia. Meningitis is transmitted among people through droplets of respiratory or throat secretions from infected people. Close and prolonged contact or living in close quarters with an infected person facilitates the spread of the disease. Although people of all ages can catch the disease, it mainly affects babies, children, and young people.

"We are scaling up control measures within the community and rapidly investigating suspected cases in surrounding localities to treat patients and curb potentially widespread infections," said Dr Amedee Prosper Djiguimde, WHO Representative in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

More than 1.6 million people aged between 1 and 29 years were vaccinated in a massive campaign in 2016 in Tshopo, which lies in the African meningitis belt that runs across the continent from Senegal to Ethiopia and comprises 26 countries. The African meningitis belt is the most vulnerable globally to recurrent outbreaks.

Meningitis outbreaks have occurred in several provinces of the Democratic Republic of Congo in the past. In 2009, an outbreak in Kisangani infected 214 people and caused 15 deaths--a case fatality ratio of 8%.

Meningitis is potentially fatal and is a medical emergency. Admission for treatment is necessary and appropriate antibiotic treatment must be started as soon as possible. Over the years, major improvements have been made on vaccines, which are specific to the type of meningitis.

In November 2020, the World Health Assembly--the global health policy-setting body--approved a roadmap for a meningitis-free world by 2030, with three key objectives: elimination of bacterial meningitis, reduction of vaccine-preventable bacterial meningitis by 50%, and deaths by 70%, as well as reduction of disability and improvement of quality of life after meningitis.

[Provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) are divided into territories and cities. Banalia, the community affected by the meningococcal meningitis outbreak, is a territory in the province of Tshopo, in the north-central part of the country (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banalia_Territory); the provincial capital of Tshopo is the city of Kisangani (formerly Stanleyville), with an estimated population of 1.2 million residents in 2020 (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Republic_of_the_Congo). A map showing the location of Tshopo can be found at https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/files/2015/06/Decentralized-provinces-of-the-DRC-CDRC_DG002_122.jpg. A map showing the location of Banalia can be found at https://goo.gl/maps/Yo1GJifUCGnZjsre9.

The "African Meningitis Belt" extends from Senegal in the west to Ethiopia and Eritrea in the east, where numerous cases of meningococcal meningitis are reported each year during the dry season, between December and June, and every 5-12 years large outbreaks occurred (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2020/travel-related-infectious-diseases/meningococcal-disease). Before mass preventive immunization campaigns with a meningococcal conjugate serogroup A vaccine, which started in 2010, serogroup A meningococcus accounted for an estimated 80-85% of all cases in the meningitis belt. As of June 2015, over 220 million persons aged 1 to 29 years received meningococcal A conjugate vaccine in 15 countries of the African meningitis belt; since then, the proportion of serogroup A declined dramatically, but other meningococcal serogroups such as serogroups W, X, and C have replaced serogroup A, although at a lower frequency and smaller size of the outbreaks (https://www.afro.who.int/health-topics/meningococcal-meningitis and https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/220/Supplement_4/S274/5610778). A map of the African bacterial meningitis belt can be found at https://www.researchgate.net/figure/The-meningitis-belt-of-sub-Saharan-Africa-and-meningococcal-serogroup-A-conjugate-vaccine_fig1_320819976.

Outbreaks of meningococcal meningitis, many due to meningococcus serogroup A, have occurred in the DRC in the past (see ProMED posts listed below) and a mass meningococcal conjugate A vaccination campaign took place in 6 DRC provinces, possibly including Tshopo, that vaccinated about 18 million people (aged 1-29 years) between 2016-2018 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6822965/).

More information on this outbreak, as to the meningococcal serogroup involved and the meningococcal vaccination status of the population, would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.ML
