Alert issued on mineral water products
-------------------
The Centre for Food Safety has urged retailers to
stop selling 3 types of Jermuk mineral water
products which contain excessive arsenic.
The products are labeled "Jermuk Original
Sparkling Natural Mineral Water Fortified With
Natural Gas From The Spring", "Jermuk Sodium
Calcium Bicarbonate and Sulphate Mineral Water",
and "Jermuk, Natural Mineral Water Sparkling".
The US Food & Drug Administration has issued a
warning to consumers not to drink the products.
The centre is contacting American authorities for
more information and will monitor the situation.
