Zimbabwean authorities report Anthrax outbreak.
--------------------------------------------------
Agriculture officials in Zimbabwe Thursday reported an outbreak of
anthrax in the north of the country, saying both humans and
livestock had been affected. Chief government veterinary officer
Stuart Hargreaves said the disease broke out in the northern
district of Chiweshe, adding that control teams had quarantined the
area and had begun mass vaccination of cattle. Veterinary
officials said scores of cattle had died, and people infected are
suspected to have consumed meat from the dead animals.
Health officials in the district said 5 people had been admitted in
local hospitals, suffering from anthrax. "We are vaccinating cattle at
this moment in time and the disease should be brought under
control soon," said Hargreaves.
Zimbabwe has suffered intermittent outbreaks of anthrax and foot
& mouth diseases, which have adversely affected its beef industry.
The country has banned beef exports to the European Union and
South Africa due to the outbreaks.
Veterinary officials in Chiweshe said they suspected the anthrax
outbreak stemmed from the illegal movement of cattle by people
being resettled under the government's controversial land policies.

5 people showing symptoms of anthrax have been admitted to
Howard Hospital following an outbreak of the disease in Musarara,
Chiweshe. Mashonaland Central deputy provincial veterinary
officer Dr Taremeredzwa Mawango said the outbreak was first
reported early this month [October 2003] after the 5 were
hospitalised. There was also a mysterious death of cattle in the
area.
Dr Mawango said the outbreak of the disease could have been
caused by the illegal movement of cattle, especially in newly settled
farms, from unknown affected areas. He appealed to people not to
move livestock without permits from his department, as this would
result in the spread of the disease. Stern measures would be taken
against those who move cattle without permits. "We are going to
enforce the laws governing cattle movement very stringently, as
this has contributed to the spread of the disease, and let those who
violate the law be warned that they will be prosecuted," said Dr
Mawango.
The Department of Veterinary Services has since mobilised
vaccines for the area and 3550 cattle have so far been vaccinated
at Chidhau and Manomano dip tanks.
Dr Mawango said the situation was now under control and
veterinary officers were still on the ground monitoring the situation.
Last year [2002] an outbreak of anthrax killed 2 people and left 20
others infected at a new resettlement area and 2 villages in Bindura.
The 2 died at Harare Hospital after eating meat from a cow
suspected to have been infected with anthrax.
