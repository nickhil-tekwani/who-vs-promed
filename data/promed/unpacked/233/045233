BSE Confirmed in Suspect Animal, Investigations Underway
-------------------------
The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) today confirmed that an
older dairy cow from Alberta has tested positive for bovine
spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). The infected animal was born in
1996, prior to the introduction of the 1997 feed ban. It is suspected
that the animal became infected by contaminated feed before the feed
ban.
No part of the animal entered the human food or animal feed systems.
This finding does not indicate an increased risk to food safety.
Canada's public health safeguards have been developed on the
assumption that a low, declining level of BSE remains in North
America. Canada requires the removal of specified risk material (SRM)
from all animals entering the human food supply. SRM are tissues
that, in infected cattle, contain the BSE agent. This measure is
internationally recognized as the most effective means to protect
public health from BSE.
Confirming BSE in this animal is not unexpected. Canada has in place
a suite of risk mitigation measures to protect public and animal
health, including the removal of SRM from the human food chain, the
ruminant to ruminant feed ban, the national surveillance program and
import restrictions. As a result, the United States continues to
consider Canada as a minimal risk region. As stated in the United
States Department of Agriculture press release of 30 Dec 2004, the
United States would not alter the implementation of its rule to
resume trade with Canada.
The infected animal was detected through the recently enhanced
national surveillance program. Additional cases may be found as
testing of high-risk cattle continues. In 2004, the Government of
Canada tested over 22 000 animals.
The CFIA is continuing its investigation and has determined the
infected animal's farm of origin. Efforts are now underway to
identify any other animals of similar risk. Specifically, the Agency
is focusing on 2 categories of animals: recently born offspring of
the infected animal and cattle born on the same farm within a year of
the infected animal. This work is proceeding as
quickly as possible.
The Agency has also launched a feed investigation to examine what the
infected animal was fed early in its life, when infection was most
likely to have occurred prior to the 1997 feed ban. Given the age of
the animal, it may not be possible to definitively identify a
particular feed source as the origin of infection. However,
information gathered through investigations and analyses continues to
suggest that the feed ban has limited the spread of BSE since its
implementation.
In 1989, Canada banned further importation of cattle from the United
Kingdom and traced all imported cattle to their Canadian farms of
origin, where they were monitored and eventually destroyed. Before
this time, when BSE had not emerged as a significant animal health
threat, it is likely that some imported animals entered the North
American feed system.
The CFIA will hold a technical briefing on January 3, 2005 at 11:00
EST. A media advisory will be issued with additional information.

Canada officials confirm second mad cow case
---------------------------
A final laboratory test has confirmed an Alberta dairy cow had mad
cow disease, the second case Canada has found in its herd, the
Canadian Food Inspection Agency said on Sunday.
Veterinary officials said on Thursday that preliminary tests had been
positive for the brain-wasting mad cow disease, or bovine spongiform
encephalopathy (BSE).
"Confirming BSE in this animal is not unexpected," the agency said in
a news release, noting it was born before feed rules designed to stop
the spread of the disease.
The United States, Canada's largest export market, announced last
week it would begin to accept imports of young, live cattle thought
to be at low risk for the disease from March 7, and U.S. officials
said on Thursday there were no plans to change that, despite the
preliminary positive
test.
The animal did not enter the human food or animal feed supply and
there was no risk to the public.
Canada's first home-grown case of mad cow disease was found in May
2003 and cost export-dependent farmers an estimated C$5 billion (USD
4.2 billion) as trade partners closed their borders to Canadian beef
and cattle.
The first U.S. case, found in Washington state in December 2003, also
affected a cow that had been born in Canada.
The most recent afflicted animal was born in October 1996, an
industry source said.
"You've now got a grouping of 3 animals born very close together in
time," the source said, adding the agency was investigating whether
the animals shared a common contaminated feed source.
The agency said it would brief reporters on Monday at 11a.m. EST/1600 GMT
on its investigation, which has already traced the cow to the Alberta
farm where it was born.

[Based upon the number of preliminary tests, the animal being
classified as a downer and between 8 and 10 years, the suspicions
were very high this was likely a positive case. This clearly
indicates the surveillance program in Canada is working. - Mod.TG]
