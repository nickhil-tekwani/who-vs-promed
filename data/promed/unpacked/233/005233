Dr Anne Scoging and a colleague at the U.K. Central Public Health Authority
were cited as writing in a letter to The Lancet medical journal that 49
people developed acute nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain and
fever within 30 minutes of eating mussels in two London restaurants last
year. [The mussels], harvested in Britain. "This outbreak represents the
first incident for 30 years caused by phycotoxin contamination of UK
shellfish and the first ever incident having okadaic acid as the causative
agent," they added.
The story says that phycotoxins are produced by small marine organisms.
When they are eaten by shellfish such as mussels the concentrations are
very high and cause severe stomach problems in humans. Okadaic acid is the
one of the most common shellfish toxins.

[We are getting such reports with increasing frequency, whether it is due
to climate changes and/or better physician recognition I am unsure.
Forty-nine people ill within 30 minutes of eating mussels at only two
restaurants would trigger a proper full investigation. Unfortunately the
diagnoses of affected single individuals seen by family doctors are
probably missed, and thus the full extent of this problem. - Mod.MHJ]
