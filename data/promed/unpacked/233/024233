More than 70 cases of "uta" [a Peruvian name for cutaneous leishmaniasis]
have been reported in recent weeks in the district of Huacrachuco, capital
of the province of Maranon, 320 km to the northeast of Huaraz, according to
the mayor of that city, Julian Salazar Arteaga.
He indicated that in the populated areas of San Juan de Cholon and San
Pedro de Chonta there have been 78 cases of uta principally among 30
children of school age who have not attended classes out of fear of being
shunned by their classmates. The children presented with ulcers on the
face and extremities.
The mayor has asked for assistance from the Regional Directorate of Health
because they are increasingly worried about the outbreak. Local and
regional clinics do not have the required medicines to control the disease,
and the two doctors in the regional clinic attend to the needs of more than
3,000 residents of the district.
The Regional Director of Health, Javier Revilla Aguilar, confirmed that 20
other cases of uta have been reported this year in other areas. He also
reported that medicines have been sent, and he maintains that the disease
is under control.
Finally, he said that DDT is no longer used to destroy the vector since the
insecticide damages the environment. Health authorities are pursuing a
program of prevention by detection, diagnosis, and treatment.
