Dr. Louisa Woonton, Niue, has advised that group A _Streptococcus_ has been
identified in 15-20% of the specimens tested on patients with symptoms of
the above illness. The second child referred to New Zealand, like the
first child, has chorea. The first child with chorea was subsequently
diagnosed as having acute rheumatic fever.
