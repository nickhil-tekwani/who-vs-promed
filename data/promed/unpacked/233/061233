Influenza update - 280 (based on data up to 25 Dec, 2016)
---------------------------------------------------------
Summary
-------
Influenza activity in the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere continued to increase, with many countries especially in Europe and East Asia passing their seasonal threshold early in comparison with previous years. Worldwide, influenza A(H3N2) virus was predominant. The majority of influenza viruses characterized so far is similar antigenically to the reference viruses representing vaccine components for 2016-2017 influenza season. The majority of recently circulating viruses tested for antiviral sensitivity are susceptible to neuraminidase inhibitor antiviral medications.

- In North America, influenza activity continued to increase with influenza A(H3N2) virus predominating. Influenza-like illness (ILI) levels just surpassed the seasonal thresholds in the United States. In the United States, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) activity increased.
- In Europe, influenza activity was increasing, with influenza A (H3N2) virus being the most prominent subtype. People aged over 65 years were most frequently associated with severe disease.
- In East Asia, influenza activity continued to increase with influenza A(H3N2) viruses predominant.
- In Western Asia, influenza activity increased slightly.
- In Southern Asia influenza activity increased mainly due to influenza A(H3N2) . Increased activity was reported in recent weeks by the Islamic Republic of Iran and Sri Lanka.
- In South East Asia, influenza activity continued to decrease, with influenza A(H3N2) virus and influenza B predominating in the region.
- In Northern Africa, continued increased influenza detections were reported in Morocco and Tunisia with influenza A(H3N2) virus dominating.
- In West Africa, influenza continued to be detected in Ghana with B viruses dominating.
- In the Caribbean countries and Central America, influenza and other respiratory virus activity remained low in general.
- In tropical South America, influenza and other respiratory viruses activity remained low.
- In the temperate zone of the Southern Hemisphere, influenza activity is at inter-seasonal levels.

National Influenza Centers (NICs) and other national influenza laboratories from 74 countries, areas or territories reported data to FluNet for the time period [Mon 12 Dec to Sun 25 Dec 2016] (data as of Fri 6 Jan 2017 04:12:46 UTC).The WHO GISRS [Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System] laboratories tested more than 124 657 specimens during that time period. Of these 25 263 were positive for influenza viruses, of which 24 223 (95.9 per cent) were typed as influenza A and 1040 (4.1 per cent) as influenza B. Of the sub-typed influenza A viruses, 159 (1.3 per cent) were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and 11927 (98.7 per cent) were influenza A(H3N2). Of the characterized B viruses, 67 (34.9 per cent) belonged to the B-Yamagata lineage and 125 (65.1 per cent) to the B-Victoria lineage.

[2] Turkey: increased cases

A massive flu epidemic has spread across Turkey, with the Turkish Health Ministry announcing that one in 3 people is suffering from the disease in the country amid a drop in temperatures.

The ministry analyzed patient samples that it obtained from a total of 180 family doctors in 17 provinces between [Mon 19 and Sun 25 Dec 2016], detecting flu in 34.6 per cent of the samples, daily Habertürk reported on [Fri 6 Jan 2017].

The samples were analyzed in 7 different laboratories in Istanbul, the Black Sea province of Samsun, the eastern province of Erzurum, the southern province of Adana and the western province of İzmir.

In the 1202 samples that were taken in 2016, only 8.4 per cent tested positive for flu. Influenza A (H3N2) was detected in 87 per cent of all the samples, influenza B was detected in 12 per cent of the samples and influenza A was detected in 2 per cent of the samples [This doesn't make sense to me. Presumably these percentages must be from among those that tested positive rather than "all the samples". Also one would expect influenza A (H3N2) to be a subset of all influenza A and therefore be a lower percentage of all samples. - Mod.SH].

A total of 47 of the 136 samples that were taken between [Mon 19 and Sun 25 Dec 2016], were determined to contain the flu. Some 40 per cent of the samples had influenza A (H3N2), while 7 per cent of them had influenza B. The latest findings suggest that the numbers peaked in the samples taken most recently.

"We are now going through a usual process. Because the weather got cold early this year, the maximum number of flu cases will also be earlier," Professor Mehmet Ceylan told daily Habertürk. "We'll continue to see the virus until the spring. People in risk groups should definitely be vaccinated. The time doesn't matter. The vaccination protects a person for 6 months. The virus types that were detected until now are the ones that can be prevented by vaccination," he said. During his interview, Ceylan stressed the significance of washing hands 4 or 5 times a day with ample soap and water in preventing the flu.

Meanwhile, Istanbul's emergency services are nearly full due to the flu epidemic. Emergency services at state and private hospitals in Istanbul were left strained by the large numbers of locals seeking medical assistance due to flu symptoms.

Infectious disease specialist Dr Okan Derin encouraged people to take precautions against the epidemic, urging them to take care of their hygiene, Doğan News Agency reported. "Flu opens the door to diseases that can be life-threatening," he said, noting that infection can spread with sneezing and coughing. "The virus shortly spreads to all cells via the respiratory tracts. The virus causes chills, shaking, fever, weakness and myogenic pain. Hygiene is very important in protecting against the epidemic."

[3] France: high risk for elderly
Date: Wed 11 Jan 2017
Source: RFI France [edited]
http://en.rfi.fr/france/20170111-elderly-risk-france-hit-major-flu-outbreak


French health authorities have warned that an influenza epidemic is stretching hospitals to close to breaking point. Health minister Marisol Touraine on [Wed 11 Jan 2017] predicted that the outbreak will take a heavy toll.

Thousands of people, most of them elderly, have been admitted to hospital due to an outbreak of a virulent strain of the virus known as H3N2.

Last week [week of 1 Jan 2017] 395 in every 100 000 French people consulted their doctor over flu symptoms, up from 326 the previous week [week of 25 Dec 2016], health authorities report.

But the number of people going to emergency services and the number of hospitalizations fell slightly last week, to 4 788 and 787 respectively.

Touraine called on the country's hospitals to delay non-urgent operations to make room for those affected. "We are approaching the peak of the epidemic, which means that we are in the middle of it," she said on Wednesday. "People will continue to fall ill. So I am asking all hospitals, private and public, to see if it is possible to postpone certain appointments, including surgery, in order to free up beds for flu patients."

The virus is most likely to affect people over the age of 65. Most of the people admitted to hospital were over 80 and were kept in for 10-15 days. Of France's 850 hospitals, 142 have declared themselves to be under pressure, allowing them to add beds, recall health workers on holiday or cancel non-urgent operations.

Some doctors have criticized the closure of beds over the last 20 years, claiming it has left hospitals underequipped to face the annual flu outbreak. This year's outbreak started earlier than usual, in [December 2016] and 784 000 people have seen a doctor for symptoms since then.

In 2014-15 nearly 2.9 million people were hit by an epidemic that caused an estimated 18 300 extra deaths, most of them of people over 65.

[In both national reports the surge in influenza cases has coincided with falling temperatures. Influenza A/H3N2 viruses seem to predominate. Vaccinations of at-risk groups is highly recommended to reduce the disease burden, particularly as the recommended vaccine composition is a close match to the circulating influenza viruses. - Mod.UBA
