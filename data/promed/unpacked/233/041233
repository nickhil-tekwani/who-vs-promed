_E. coli_ Bacteria Spreads
-------------------
The outbreak of the fatal _E. coli_ bacteria continues to spread across the
nation as an increasing number of people are reporting similar symptoms.
The National Institute of Health (NIH) said yesterday that a 17-year-old
girl and a 9-year-old boy at a physical rehabilitation center in Kwangju,
Kyonggi Province [where the capitol, Seoul, is located. - Mod.LL] were
newly reported as suspected _E. coli_ patients, raising the total number of
cases to 14. [Given the severity of illness, the cases may be O157:H7
disease. - Mod.LL]
Another child at the facility, a 14-year-old who was already being treated
for the disease, is reported to be in critical condition. A 4-year-old boy
at the center died on Fri, 20 Jun 2003 after showing symptoms such as
diarrhea and high fever.
The NIH said a total of 19 people have been classified as carriers
[presumably meaning having been infected - Mod. LL] of the bacteria so far.
They include 15 at the Kwangju facility and the parents and 14-month-old
brother of an 8-year-old boy who died of the disease last week at a
livestock farm in Yangpyong, Kyonggi Province.
Officials are suspecting food contamination as the source of the outbreak.
The NIH said that it is investigating the distributors of cafeteria food to
the Kwangju center, and the schools, kindergartens, and academies in the
region which the other suspected patients have been attending.
The NIH stressed that keeping hands clean at all times is the best
precaution against the infection.

[The outbreak here may well be O157:H7, but the clinical description of
high fever (often the patient is afebrile) and prominent diarrhea (many
times there is primarily bloody discharge but not diarrhea) speak against
O157:H7. - Mod.LL]
[More information on this outbreak would be appreciated as it becomes
available. - Mod.MPP]
