Chronic wasting disease (CWD), a fatal neurological disorder similar to
mad-cow disease (Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy, BSE), has been found in
a wild deer in an area previously thought free of it, officials in the
Canadian Prairie province of Saskatchewan said on Thu 24 Oct 2002.
Since 1990, 3 cases of the disease had been found in wild mule deer
clustered in the west-central part of the province. But the new case, a
2-year-old buck shot by a hunter this fall, was about 255 kilometers (160
miles) away, raising concerns the disease has spread.
"We're disappointed," said Kevin Omoth, who monitors the disease for the
Saskatchewan government. "We were becoming guardedly optimistic it was
existing only in that area of the (province)," he said. The government will
reduce deer herds by allowing more hunting, and step up testing efforts,
Omoth said.
The brain-wasting illness belongs to the same family of diseases as bovine
spongiform encephalopathy, more commonly known as mad-cow disease. A deadly
human version of BSE, new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD), has
killed close to 100 people in Britain after they ate BSE-tainted beef.
In August, a Saskatchewan man died of the disease. Health officials believe
he consumed tainted beef during visits to the Britain in the late 1980s and
early 1990s.
Health officials say CWD in deer poses no known risk to humans or domestic
livestock, Omoth said. "But you'll never find a scientist who says there's
(categorically) no risk, and that's what makes people uncomfortable," he said.
The provincial government has tested about 5500 mule deer for the disease
during the past 4 years. Hunters submit deer heads, since there is no live
test for the illness.
The disease has not been found in wild animals in other provinces, Omoth
said, nor in other species of wild animals in Canada, although it is
present in the wild in the United States.
The disease has decimated the domestic elk farming industry since it was
first detected on a ranch in 1996. More than 7500 animals have been
destroyed. Elk are raised for meat and antler velvet, which is used in
homeopathic remedies and as an aphrodisiac, especially in Asia. Markets for
elk meat and velvet have evaporated since the disease outbreak.
Scientists do not know what causes the disease or how it spreads. Some
scientists think the disease has always existed at low levels in the wild,
but been undetected until recently, Omoth said.
Others believe it spread from game farms, although Omoth said there is no
evidence to support that theory.
