[1] Malawi, post-exposure treatment challenged

People of Ntcheu, Balaka, and Machinga districts [in Malawi; for geographic locations, see commentary. - Mod.AS] are at high risk of contracting rabies due to a reported shortage of drugs amid rising cases of rabid dog bites.

People from the 3 districts are being referred to Mangochi and Zomba hospitals, which have the anti-rabies vaccine.

Balaka District Hospital spokesperson, Mercy Nyirenda, confirmed that the hospital has run out of anti-rabies drugs. "The consignment for last month [September 2018] has ended. Anti-rabies drugs are expensive, such that we do not buy them in larger amounts due to drug budget constraints," Nyirenda said.

Machinga District Hospital publicist, Clifford Ngozo, confirmed that the hospital is struggling to treat victims of dog bites. He said that, as of last week [week of 15 Oct 2018], the hospital had enough stock to deal with dog bite cases in the district.

To treat a patient, Ngozo said the hospital requires MWK 50 000 [USD 68.77], meaning that the hospital spends MWK 30 million [USD 41 263] on the drugs every month. "So, from our drug budget, it is not possible for us to have anti-rabies drugs on a daily basis. This is also the reason some hospitals are not stocking anti-rabies drugs, because they are afraid of spending more money on a single drug," Ngozo said.

He said there was need for the Department of Veterinary Services to take a leading role in vaccinating dogs, which, he said, is cheaper than treating a patient. "The situation is serious. Some people only get the 1st dose, because we cannot give them the drugs to administer to themselves at home. By the time they come to get another injection, the drug is out of stock. We don't know how it ends with them," Ngozo said.

However, those in remote areas are unable to access treatment in the 2 districts' hospitals, thereby putting their lives at risk. Persons who are bitten by rabid dogs receive preventive vaccines in 5 doses within 28 days. Once a person develops rabies, there is no medication for the disease.

Ministry of Health spokesperson, Joshua Malango, said Malawi has enough stocks of anti-rabies drugs at CMST. He said there is no way a hospital can operate without the drug. Malango further said he would establish reasons why the 3 hospitals are not stocking the drugs.

The 3 districts are among many areas that have been hit by rabies in the country. Recently, Rumphi District Animal Health and Livestock development officer Harvey Kumwenda told Malawi News Agency that his office had, since January 2018, registered 464 cases of people bitten by dogs; of these, 23.2 percent had been bitten by suspected rabid dogs.

On 14 Jul 2018, Zodiak Broadcasting Station website reported that 22 people died of rabies in Mulanje District this year [2018] alone.

Mulanje, according to a statement released by the District Agricultural Development Office and District Health Office, has the highest number of deaths of people and dogs due to rabies as well as dog bites in the Blantyre Agricultural Development Division.

The website quotes District Animal Health and Livestock development officer Taurai Mbengo and District Environmental Health officer Thomson Kajumbo as saying the figures are alarming.

[For the locations of the 3 Malawi districts reporting difficulties in post-exposure treatment (Ntcheu, Balaka, and Machinga), see map at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Districts_of_Malawi (their respective numbers on the map are 7, 16, and 20).

The most recent annual report from Malawi's veterinary authorities, available on OIE's website, dates back to 2015 (https://tinyurl.com/y84hn4kf). According to the report, in relation to rabies in all domestic animals during 2015, there were a total of 5 rabies outbreaks. In canines, there were 123 rabies cases, 31 deaths, 149 "killed and disposed of," and 267 351 official vaccinations.

Malawi's annual numbers of reported rabies cases in humans, as available on OIE/WAHID website, are the following: 2015: 3; 2014: 2; 2013: 50; 2012: 22; 2011: 3.

Rabies prevention and control in Malawi may represent a similar situation in other developing countries in Africa and elsewhere, on both human and animal fronts. There could be room for improved reporting as well. - Mod.AS]

[2] Israel, jackals

http://www.hachaklait.org.il


A new rabies case in a jackal has been identified in the "Valley of Springs" [Emeq Hamayanot, northeast Israel, map at https://tinyurl.com/ya6qx24b). This is the 3rd such case in the last 30 days and the 58th rabies case in Israel during 2018.

The Field Veterinary Services have discontinued compulsory cattle vaccination in the region, which was imposed last year [2017] due to the rabies outbreak in jackals. On farms where the animals were vaccinated already twice, it is recommended to consider [voluntary] vaccination of the offspring to decrease losses due to the extended movement ban that would be imposed on such farms in case of rabies cases in cattle.

[According to the Veterinary Services' website, since the start of 2018, the following 59 animals have been lab confirmed as rabid: 43 jackals, 6 dogs, 7 cattle, 1 sheep, 1 horse, and 1 badger (see with a "dynamic map" at https://tinyurl.com/y8w7jw3m). Most of the cases were observed in the northeast, adjacent to the Jordanian and Syrian borders.

The explosive rabies in jackals, which involved the said part of Israel since August 2017, peaking earlier this year (2018), does not seem to have died out yet. Such an event in a country that has been practising annual oral vaccination of wildlife for some 15 years is rather puzzling. A scientific summary and, in particular, evaluation of its background would be valuable locally and beyond. - Mod.AS]

[3] South Africa, puppy

Early this month [October 2018], a crossbreed puppy of approximately 12 weeks old was brought into the Kloof and Highway SPCA reception by a kind member of the public who had found it in her garden in Wyebank. The puppy was brought in a box, and the reception staff immediately noticed that there was something wrong with the puppy. When examined, it was observed to have neurological issues and was extremely vocal.

The decision was immediately made to humanly euthanise the puppy, and it was sent to the state vet for rabies testing. Once the test was conducted, a positive rabies result was confirmed. This is the 13th positive rabies result this year at the Kloof and Highway SPCA.

This puppy was suffering and could have infected other animals and people with the rabies virus; we are so grateful to the lady and her son who rushed the puppy to our SPCA and saved it from further suffering.

When the staff received the positive rabies result, the woman was immediately contacted and informed of the seriousness of the situation. She also confirmed that 5 people had been in contact with the puppy before it was brought into the Kloof and Highway SPCA.

The Kloof and Highway SPCA are urging members of the public to make sure their pets are vaccinated against rabies as well as exercise caution when approaching stray animals.

"If you find a stray animal you are not familiar with, approach it only if it is safe to do so and absolutely necessary. In the event of being bitten or scratched, immediately wash the area very well, flush under running water, and immediately seek medical attention.

"If you are bitten or scratched by an animal with no proof of vaccination, you will be required to go for a costly course of rabies vaccinations treatment.

"Rabies is fatal, and the threat of it should not be taken lightly. We strongly advise against keeping any stray animals with the rising threat of rabies," said Brigitte Ferguson of the SPCA.

[The serious hazard of rabies in puppies has been repeatedly addressed in ProMED-mail's rabies postings. Collecting stray puppies may pose a life-endangering threat, in particular for children who commonly deal with them.

In recent years, the prevention of rabies in Viet Nam has been promoted and has achieved certain results. However, rabies has always been one of the infectious diseases with the highest number of deaths.

Year-to-date [14 Oct 2018], human rabies deaths in Viet Nam total 67. This compares to 78 in all of 2015, 91 in 2016, and 74 last year [2017].

Rabies, an infectious viral disease spread to people through animal bites, imposes a health economic burden amounting to IRR 1.8 trillion (about USD 42 million) on the country annually, head of zoonotic diseases department at the Ministry of Health has said.

Zoonotic means infectious diseases that are spread between animals and people.

"Over the past year, more than 180 000 individuals have suffered a significant animal bite throughout the country," ISNA quoted Behzad Amiri as saying.

Bites by stray dogs accounted for 90 percent of the cases reported last year, and 40 percent of individuals bitten were children under 15 years, Amiri lamented. "Despite the high number of animal bites, the number of people infected by rabies or deaths related to the disease in the country is less than 10 persons per year. Of course, even less than 10 cases are unacceptable, and we will work along with the World Health Organization to zero the human rabies caused by dog biting by the end of 2030," he added.

There are more than 700 rabies treatment-and-prevention centers in the country, Amiri said, adding, if a person has been bitten by an animal, he or she will refer to these centers and undergo preventive measures, which is why the rate of rabies in the country is very low.

Amiri further explained that plans are being implemented in the country to prevent the disease; when a person refers to a treatment center due to an animal's bite, the person will receive an anti-rabies vaccine; in cases of the animal not being available, we are obliged to complete the vaccination cycle (4 doses of vaccine and anti-rabies serum) for the individual.

"The total cost incurred for both anti-rabies vaccine and anti-rabies serum is reported to be about IRR 10 million (nearly USD 240) per patient, and with 180 000 people bitten by infected animals last year [2017], it cost us some IRR 1.8 trillion (about USD 42 million) for treatment of the patients," he explained, adding that vaccination and equine rabies immunoglobulin are free of charge in Iran.

Amiri went on to note that to eradicate rabies in the country, a stray dog's bites must be avoided, adding, in this regard, a legislation or act to control stray dog's population is required.

In the past, wild or domestic animal bites were more likely to occur in rural areas, but this is already happening in the cities due to the growing population of stray dogs in urban areas, he concluded.
