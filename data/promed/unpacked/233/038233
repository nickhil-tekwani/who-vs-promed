Public health authorities in the Caribbean city of Riohacha said
today [21 May 2010] that at least 25 suspected cases of anthrax have
been documented in indigenous Wayuu settled in rural villages of the
municipality of Riohacha.

Jesus Perez Almenares, Health Secretary for the municipality of
Riohacha, reported to EFE [news agency] that these are cases of
cutaneous lesions compatible with the disease. "It is a zoonotic
outbreak (diseases transmitted from animals to humans)," said Perez,
who insisted that for now [patients] are [only] showing cutaneous
lesions. People with suspected cases in the departmental capital of
La Guajira were [informed of the situation] 6 days after the National
Health Institute (INS) confirmed that the Wayuu [girl] had contracted anthrax.

The girl, aged 13, lives in an aboriginal hamlet in the coastal
locality of Manaure and apparently contracted the disease from
contact with the blood of a goat, which was "possibly infected with
anthrax." According to the Ministry of Social Welfare (health and
work), "this patient is responding satisfactorily to treatment."

Health authorities were studying 3 suspected cases of the disease in
Manaure, where, as well as in Riohacha, an intensive campaign has
been implemented to confront this threat to public health in the
region, which is part of the northern border with Venezuela where
there are also Wayuu settlements. Experts from the Pan American
Health Organization (PAHO), the INS, the National Institute of Food
and Drug Monitoring (Invima), and the Ministry of Social Welfare, are
participating in the campaign, in addition to teams from the Riohacha
and La Guajira health departments. Also participating are officials
from the Colombian Agricultural Institute (ICA), who have begun a
vaccination campaign of goats and sheep, basic subsistence species
for these natives.

Perez told EFE agency that there are more than 100 000 head of these
species just in the aboriginal villages in Riohacha. Perez said, "The
order is to vaccinate every animal." He insisted that protective
measures should be taken when handling sick animals or those who die
suddenly, in which case it is advisable not to eat the meat. While
acknowledging that the indigenous people have knowledge [of the
protective measures], the doctor said that such animals should be
incinerated and the remains buried underground.

Suspecting the presence of the disease and to determine if an
outbreak has occurred, since 14 May 2010, the regional health
authorities have visited residents of 12 localities in the 2 urban
centers [Riohacha and Manaure]. 750 interviews established that 62 of
the natives had a "recorded history of skin lesions consistent with
anthrax in the past 6 months." Of these, 37 individuals live in
Manaure and 25 in Riohacha according to the official report, which
also indicates that the cutaneous lesions have already healed in 74
percent [46 people] of them. Of the 62 natives, "16 have lesions in
active and resolution phase and it was possible to obtain samples for
direct examination from 15 people."

The survey shows that 76 percent of the Wayuu natives "have a history
of having handled sick or dead animals in pasture work, slaughtering,
or butchering for consumption."

[It is very clear that there is an ongoing endemic/enzootic problem
in the region around Riohacha, especially in the interior. And that
until this human index case emerged any control programmes had been
ineffective.
