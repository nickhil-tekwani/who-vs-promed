Cryptosporidia outbreak in children in Missouri
-----------------------------------------------
Health officials in Madison County are gathering recent medical histories,
seeking to determine how microscopic intestinal parasites spread from 2
human cases at the beginning of last week to 30 confirmed over the weekend.
When the first 2 cases were reported last week, the Fredericktown municipal
pool was voluntarily closed as a precaution, as one of the 1st 2 children
with the reported infections had been swimming there. Health officials said
on Tuesday they do not know at this point how or where the infections spread.

On 8 Aug 2005, 2 family doctors reported separately that one child had an
infection called cryptosporidiosis and the other had giardiasis, according
to Teresa Clark. She is a registered nurse who works for the Madison County
Health Department in southeast Missouri. But, Clark said, one child from
the first 2 cases had been to the municipal pool while the other had not.
She did not have a count on how many of the other people infected had
visited the pool, but said no one has been hospitalized from the
infections. "We're not saying the child contracted it from the pool," she
said. "We're not saying the pool has it." But, she said, the pool has been
voluntarily closed for the rest of the summer season. She encouraged good
hygiene, like washing hands for 30 seconds with warm water and
anti-bacterial soap. Meanwhile, other pools and water parks in the region
have stepped up efforts to protect swimmers' health. At the Farmington
Civic Center, the water park has had no ties to the infections, but the
pools, which often receive hundreds of visitors daily, are taking safety
precautions just the same. The pools had been "shocked," or subjected to
unusually high levels of chlorine when not occupied by swimmers. During
normal swimming hours, chlorine levels are returned to normal, he said.
Towler said new posters tell parents young children must wear swim diapers,
remind parents that diapers cannot be changed on the pool decks, and
encourage hand washing.

[The 2 protozoan parasites Cryptosporidia and Giardia are frequently
transmitted in swimming pools. "Fecal accidents" from small children and a
relative resistance to the usual chlorine level in swimming pools makes
small outbreaks from contaminated pools difficult to avoid. In the present
outbreak, pools have been suspected, but the source has not yet been
identified. - Mod.EP]
