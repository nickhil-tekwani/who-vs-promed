A highly-virulent, newly-mutated bird flu H5N1 strain is feared to [be] spreading from north Viet Nam to the south at a menacing pace, warned deputy head of Animal Health Department Pham Van Dong.

Speaking in Ha Noi yesterday [18 Sep 2012], Dong, whose department comes under the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, said the outbreak of this strain started in July [2012] and has so far attacked 7 northern provinces plus the central province of Quang Ngai.

To prevent further spreading to the south, the ministry has ordered provinces to strengthen inspection and control activities.

In the meantime, live poultry due to be carried from north to south will not pass through the central provinces of Quang Ngai or Kon Tum until the outbreak is completely under control.

The ministry also asked local authorities to clamp down on illegal poultry imports and to tighten inspections of trans-border poultry loads destined for Viet Nam.

At the same time, vaccination and disinfection activities should be strengthened in affected areas.

[According to the report above, the central province of Quang Ngai has now been added to the 7 northern provinces reported to be infected by the mutated H5N1 strain in ProMED-mail posting 20120908.1286497.

The said strain was suspected to have been introduced from China, mainly by means of culled layers, which come in large numbers across the border from China. These spent hens (also known as "disqualified chickens") fetch higher prices in Viet Nam than in China. Viet Nam Ministry's intention to "clamp down on illegal poultry imports and tighten inspections of trans-border poultry loads" will have to overcome the powerful economic interests driven by the tempting price difference.

Viet Nam's most recent follow-up report (no 77) was submitted to the OIE on 17 Sep 2012, notifying a single outbreak in the northern Hoa Binh province, where all 400 infected birds (species not given) reportedly died. The report, including an interactive map, is available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?reportid=12349.

The epizootic started in December 2006; since then, 359 outbreaks have been reported. - Mod.AS
