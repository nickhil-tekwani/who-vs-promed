[Due to the current stability of the epidemic situation ProMED-mail
reproduces the WHO Weekly Update at intervals rather than weekly to
keep subscribers informed regarding the global situation. The
previous Weekly Update (No. 98) was posted on 1 May 2010. - Mod.CP]

Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 - WHO update 101
-------------------------------------
As of Sun 16 May 2010, worldwide more than 214 countries and overseas
territories or communities have reported laboratory confirmed cases
of pandemic influenza H1N1 2009, including more than 18 097 deaths.
The World Health Organization (WHO) is actively monitoring the
progress of the pandemic through frequent consultations with the WHO
Regional Offices and Member States and through monitoring of multiple
sources of information.

Situation update:
-----------------
The current situation is largely unchanged since the last update. The
most active areas of pandemic influenza virus transmission currently
are in parts of the Caribbean and Southeast Asia. In the temperate
zone of the northern and southern hemisphere, overall pandemic
influenza activity remains low to sporadic. In central Africa, there
has been increased transmission of seasonal influenza type B viruses,
accounting for 85 percent of all influenza isolates in the region.
Influenza B also continues to be detected at low levels across parts
of Asia and Europe, and has now been reported in Central America.

In the tropical region of the Americas, the most active areas of
pandemic influenza virus transmission continue to be in parts of the
Caribbean. In Cuba, a 2nd period of active community transmission of
pandemic influenza virus began during late February 2010, peaked
during late April 2010, and has been declining since; this 2nd period
of transmission, although associated with severe and fatal cases,
appears to be less intense overall than the 1st period of
transmission which occurred during late September to late November
2009. In contrast, in the Dominican Republic, low to moderate
intensity of respiratory diseases activity has been primarily
associated with co-circulation of respiratory viruses other than
influenza; only sporadic detections of seasonal influenza viruses
have been reported.

Low levels of pandemic influenza viruses have been circulating across
parts of Central America and tropical areas of South America, for
example, in Mexico since December 2009, in Colombia and Brazil since
early 2010, and in Guatemala since early April 2010. Nicaragua and
Honduras have also been recently reporting geographically regional
spread of influenza viruses; however, the relative proportions of
seasonal influenza, pandemic influenza, and other respiratory virus
detections are not known. In contrast, in Panama, low levels of
respiratory disease over the past 3 months have been primarily
associated with circulating respiratory viruses other than influenza.
Of note, Bolivia experienced a recent period of low but sustained
transmission of seasonal influenza type B viruses between late
February and early May 2010. There continues to be evidence from
several countries in this region that there is ongoing co-circulation
of influenza with other respiratory viruses (including respiratory
syncytial virus (RSV), and adenovirus).

In Asia, the most active areas of pandemic influenza virus
transmission are in parts of South and Southeast Asia, particularly
in Bangladesh, Malaysia, and Singapore. In Malaysia, limited data
suggests that a 2nd period of active pandemic influenza virus
transmission has been occurring since early April 2010, but overall
activity may have recently stabilized and does not appear to exceed
pandemic influenza activity seen during an earlier period of
transmission lasting from July until early September 2009. In
Singapore, levels of ARI have remained elevated since mid April 2010;
during the most recent reporting week, levels of ARI exceeded the
epidemic threshold and the proportion of patients with ILI testing
positive for pandemic influenza virus infection was 39 percent.

In Bangladesh increased co-circulation of pandemic influenza and
seasonal influenza type B viruses has been detected since mid April
2010 but now appears to have stabilized. Low level circulation of
pandemic influenza continues to persist in Thailand and in the
western and southern parts of India; sporadic detection of pandemic
influenza continue to be reported in Cambodia and in the Philippines.
In East Asia, only sporadic detections of pandemic influenza virus
are being reported; seasonal influenza type B viruses have been
predominant in this region, however circulation appears to be
declining in China and the Republic of Korea.

In the temperate regions of the northern and southern hemisphere,
overall pandemic influenza activity remains low to sporadic. In
Australia and New Zealand, slight increases in ILI [influenza-like
illness] activity were reported; however, in Australia, these
increases have been attributed primarily to circulating respiratory
viruses other than influenza. In the southern temperate regions of
the Americas, only sporadic detections of influenza viruses have been
reported, except in Chile, which continues to report localized areas
of increased ILI activity (in the Los Lagos area) associated with
co-circulation of pandemic influenza and other respiratory viruses.

In Europe, very low to sporadic levels of pandemic and seasonal
influenza type B viruses continue to be detected. Seasonal influenza
type B virus persists mainly in parts of eastern and northern Europe.
Georgia reported an increase in the number of respiratory disease
consultations due to influenza-like-illness, mainly in children
(under age 5) and school-age children (5-14 years old age group);
whether this increase is associated with pandemic influenza A (H1N1)
virus is not yet known.

In Sub-Saharan Africa, limited data from several countries suggest
that active transmission of pandemic influenza virus in West Africa
has now largely subsided. In Ghana, 6 percent of respiratory samples
tested positive for pandemic influenza virus during the most recent
reporting week. Across the rest of region, the pandemic influenza
virus continues to be detected sporadically or at low levels, most
recently in Angola and Rwanda. Sporadic detections of seasonal
influenza H3N2 and influenza B viruses have been reported in western,
central Africa and to a lesser extent southern Africa.

The Global Influenza Surveillance Network (GISN) continues monitoring
the global circulation of influenza viruses, including pandemic,
seasonal and other influenza viruses infecting, or with the potential
to infect, humans including seasonal influenza. For more information
on virological surveillance and antiviral resistance please see the
weekly virology update (Virological surveillance data, below).

Weekly update (Virological surveillance data)
---------------------------------------------
As of May 12 May 2010, 4 additional cases of oseltamivir resistant
pandemic influenza A (H1N1) 2009 viruses have been reported. It
brings the cumulative total to 289 so far. All but one of these have
the H275Y substitution and are assumed to remain sensitive to zanamivir.

resistance, please see the full text of the weekly virology update

*The reported number of fatal cases is an under representation of the
actual numbers as many deaths are never tested or recognized as
influenza related.
