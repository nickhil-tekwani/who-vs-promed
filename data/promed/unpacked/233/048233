More than 400 people have been taken ill in a "major outbreak" of cholera
and dysentery in Liberia, DPA quoted the Ministry of Health as saying on
Sat 7 Sep 2002. The outbreak was concentrated around Monrovia, in areas
where no piped water facilities are available. The victims were admitted to
the capital's John F. Kennedy Hospital.
Officials said the government had embarked on a program to clean wells in a
bid to contain the diseases, which are characterized by vomiting and
diarrhea. "The figure of 400 cases is just the tip of the iceberg," noted
a health official.
Hygiene standards in war-ravaged Monrovia are extremely low, and it is not
uncommon to see people disposing of feces in polythene bags, which
subsequently pollute drinking water sources.
