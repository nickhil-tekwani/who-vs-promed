Okinawa measles outbreak sparks vaccination checks at Japanese hospitals and nurseries - procedure being tightened after 94 more cases logged there on [Thu 11 May 2018].

The government says it plans to ensure staff at hospitals and nursery schools get 2 measles vaccines amid an outbreak of the highly contagious disease in Okinawa and other regions.

Since many people are catching measles at medical institutions, the Health, Labor and Welfare Ministry plans to urge hospitals to check the vaccination records of their employees, the government said [Fri 11 May 2018]. The ministry will also ask nursery schools to do the same.

Ever since a [20 Mar 2018] measles case in Okinawa Prefecture; 94 more cases had been logged there as of [Thu 10 May 2018]. The virus is believed to have entered via travelers from Taiwan.

The outbreak has since spread to Aichi and Kanagawa prefectures and Tokyo. A total of 37 prefectures failed to meet the target [of 95 percent vaccinated with 2 doses] in fiscal year 2016. The lowest rate was found in Okinawa, at 89.8 percent.

Also Japan introduced a MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine in 1989 but was forced to ban it 4 years later after about 2000 people suffered side effects that included aseptic meningitis. This led to a revision of the Preventive Vaccination Law in 1994 that recategorized vaccination from being mandatory to just optional.

In 2008, over 10 000 measles cases were reported in Japan, but that has dropped rapidly due to the new prevention steps. In 2015, the WHO verified that Japan had eliminated measles. However, the experts at the meeting raised concerns about the new outbreak.

"If the measles infections continue to spread for a long time, it may nullify the status," said Kazunori Oishi of the National Institute of Infectious Disease.

The Ministry of Health has announced an outbreak of measles in 26 districts across the country, according to a Monitor-Uganda report. Health minister Jane Aceng named the most affected districts as Amuru in northern Uganda, and Kamuli, Mbale, and Butebo in the east of the country.

Dr. Aceng, while addressing Alebtong District leaders at the council hall on [Wed 9 May 2018], said: "We already have 26 districts with measles outbreak, so DHO [district health officers] need to wake up and intensify routine vaccination for measles. The most affected group is children under 5 years."

She said the government, in collaboration with development partners, would carry out mass immunization against the disease of all children under 5 years.

England has been hit by a sharp rise in measles cases. More than 400 cases [between 1 Jan and 9 May 2018] have been identified, linked to large outbreaks in Europe, according to Public Health England.

Dr. Mary Ramsay says the cases are seen mostly in teens and young adults who missed their MMR [measles, mumps, rubella vaccine].

The figure is already higher than 2017, when there were 267 confirmed cases. In 2016, there were 531 confirmed cases.

There are large outbreaks in Romania and Italy and people travelling to these countries should check health advice.

A New Orleans area resident has become the 2nd person in the state to contract the highly contagious measles virus, but health officials said [Fri 11 May 2018] the risk of a broader outbreak is low.

Doctors confirmed the case on [Thu 10 May 2018] and believe the resident likely contracted the disease while traveling abroad, according to Dr. Frank Welch of the state's Office of Public Health.

The case this week is the 2nd in Louisiana since the start of April [2018], Welch said. The 1st case was also from someone who had traveled abroad. No secondary infections were reported from that case, even though the person attended what Welch called a "public event."

Nationwide, several dozen people contract the disease every year. The most recent outbreak was centered on a California amusement park [2015].

"The outbreak likely started from a traveler who became infected overseas ... then visited the amusement park while infectious," according to the CDC's website. That outbreak, and one the previous year [2016], were related to a large 2014 outbreak of the disease in the Philippines.

Another 2014 outbreak in the United States occurred in a mostly unvaccinated Amish community in Ohio, according to the CDC.

A total of 3 more measles cases have been reported as part of the outbreak in Putnam County. Nearby, the Orange County Health Department issued a warning Fri [11 May] about potential measles exposure at a medical facility in Monroe [New York]. Moreover, the New Jersey Health Department issued a warning for people who traveled through Newark Airport [New Jersey].

The Putnam outbreak now involves 6 people from 3 states and overseas. First announced [4 May 2018], it was started by an international traveler to the county.

Putnam health officials said 2 of the new cases are California residents and 1 is a Putnam resident. The initial victims were 2 local residents and a Connecticut resident.

The Putnam outbreak started with an international family from France who was visiting at the Watchtower headquarters in Patterson. So far 90 people have been interviewed because they may have been exposed.
