I read with interest the recent posting about herpes and coral disease. Clearly coral reefs globally are in a parlous state, and in many cases, diseases of unknown etiology are playing a major role. Unfortunately, studies such as the one recently posted (and others involving bacteria) do little to shed light on the issue and actually detract from the fundamental question which is, at the cellular level, what is killing corals?

Until one develops knowledge of how pathogens interact with coral cells and cause death, viral and bacterial genomics will serve only to confuse the issue. It is here that we need to carefully reconsider the fundamentals and apply the time tested tools of Galen, Hippocrates, and Virchow to gain a better understanding of how diseases affect corals at the gross and cellular level, formulate hypotheses of what may be causing disease based on sound morphologic descriptions, and proceed thence with appropriate molecular and other tools to confirm or deny these hypotheses.

This approach has worked well to elucidate many wildlife diseases and applies equally to corals (1). With this coral disease crisis, we are in many ways seeing a recapitulation of the history of medicine in microcosom, except that instead of the ancient Romans postulating swamp gas as a cause of malaria, we are now bringing to bear molecular genomics to pre-emptively conclude that certain infectious agents are killing corals. If progress is to be made on this issue, then we must strive to mend the disconnect between coral ecology and biomedical science. Hopefully, this message will encourage readers of Promed with solid knowledge of animal disease investigation to get involved, collaborate with coral ecologists, and help address this very dire situation of coral declines that is currently unfolding.
