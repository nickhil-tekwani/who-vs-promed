Nepal: Hepatitis E outbreak interrupts peace talks
--------------------------------------------------
Nepal's 84-year-old prime minister, 6 members of his Cabinet and 25
staff at his residence have fallen ill with hepatitis E, doctors and
officials said on Wed 14 Feb 2007. The outbreak of the food- and
water-borne illness has come at a crucial point in Nepal's peace
process aimed at ending a decade-old Maoist insurgency.
Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala's doctor said though he was
resting at his official residence, he "continues to fulfill his
responsibilities of national importance unabated." Although hepatitis
E is not usually fatal, its symptoms can impair the ability to work
until the illness goes away on its own, over weeks or months. The
Prime Minister's health is being monitored, said his doctor, Madhu
Ghimire. Pradeep Gyawali, one of the ministers to fall sick, said he
and many of his colleagues believe the food and water they ate and
drank at the Prime Minister's house during meetings spread the
disease.
Koirala was appointed Prime Minister last year [2006] after weeks of
pro-democracy demonstrations forced King Gyanendra to give up
authoritarian rule and reinstate Parliament. Koirala led the protests
and was joined by 6 other main political parties. He was supported by
Maoist rebels who at that time were fighting against government
troops. He is also credited with persuading the Maoists to give up
their armed revolt, sign a peace accord and join mainstream politics.
The Health Ministry issued a notice on Wed 14 Feb 2007 warning people
in the capital to be careful of what they consume. The notice said
the disease has spread in Kathmandu and precautions can be taken by
drinking boiled water and eating clean food.
Hepatitis E is spread by food or water that has been contaminated by
the feces of an infected person. Symptoms include jaundice, fatigue,
abdominal pain, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, a low
fever, and headache.

[Illness caused by hepatitis E virus infection is a self-limiting
condition with no serious outcome other than in the case of women in
the 3rd trimester of pregnancy. The circumstances of the outbreak of
hepatitis E in Kathmandu, the capital and seat of government of
Nepal, have some of the characteristics of a diplomatic maneuver.
However, ProMED-mail has reported previously (see: Hepatitis E -
Nepal 19961231.2164) that Nepal is known for endemicity of acute
liver disease in the Kathmandu Valley, and that this has been
attributed to the prevalence of hepatitis E virus infection.
Travelers to the Kathmandu region of Nepal should be aware of the
risk of hepatitis E virus infection.
