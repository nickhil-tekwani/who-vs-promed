BROWN STREAK AND MOSAIC, CASSAVA: COMBINED OUTBREAK RISK

Multiple pest and disease outbreaks threaten cassava
----------------------------------------------------
Combined outbreaks of whitefly, green mite, cassava mosaic, and
cassava brown streak in some of the world's major cassava producing
zones could lead to a collapse in production, threatening food
security in developing countries, the International Center for
Tropical Agriculture (CIAT) has found.

"There are perfect niches for some highly damaging pests and diseases
in areas currently considered safe havens," warns CIAT's Tony
Bellotti. "An outbreak of one of these could be very severe, but all 4
at once would wreak havoc." Areas most at risk include Africa's Rift
Valley region, South East Asia, southern India, Mato Grosso state in
Brazil, and northern South America.

"Risks to cassava are now global. A disease could jump an entire
continent and establish itself very quickly," Bellotti adds. Stem
cuttings (stakes) to grow new plants are one of the major causes of
the spread of pests and diseases. "Many farmers are totally unprepared
for this. To protect one of the world's most important crops, it's
going to be critical to refine and enforce protocols for the movement
of stakes."

The report calls for an early warning system to ensure that any
outbreaks are dealt with swiftly. "Without a coordinated international
effort, it's almost inevitable that the potential niches will
eventually see serious outbreaks," Bellotti states.

[Cassava brown streak (or root rot) disease is caused by _Cassava
brown streak virus_ (CBSV; tentative member of genus _Ipomovirus_),
and cassava mosaic disease (CMD) is caused by a number of species and
strains in the genus _Begomovirus_. Both CBSV and the CMD viruses have
whitefly vectors which are also a serious pest in their own right, as
mentioned above. (For more information on CMD and CBSV see links and
previous ProMED-mail posts listed below.)

Crop varieties resistant to different CMD strains are being developed
for local use. In Africa, this has alleviated the problem in some
areas, but in others, the new varieties are being wiped out by brown
streak. The joint management of both diseases has become a major
challenge for cassava production since development of crop varieties
with stable resistance to multiple viruses is particularly difficult
(ProMED-mail post 20090709.2463). The different viruses can be
expected to mutate independently resulting in a range of changing
combinations of strains, and different crop varieties are likely to be
needed geared towards local viral populations.
