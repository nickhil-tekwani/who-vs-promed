Rare Nepal elephants suffer from tuberculosis
---------------------------------------------
Of Nepal's 250 endangered elephants, 10 are suffering from
tuberculosis in a national park and the disease is threatening to
spread to humans and other wildlife, authorities said on Monday [11
Jun 2007]. Chitwan National Park in southern Nepal attracts thousands
of tourists every year and has numerous rare wildlife, such as
rhinoceroses and tigers.
Park authorities said tests had confirmed at least 10 of 100
domesticated Asian elephants in Chitwan had contracted the disease in
the past 2 years.
"Tests have confirmed that the elephants have tested positive for TB
and we are trying to provide treatment," Kamal Gaire, a senior
veterinary official, said by phone from Chitwan, 80 km (50 miles)
south of Kathmandu. "This is serious because it may spread to human
beings."
Park officials said this is the 1st time that tuberculosis in
elephants had been reported in the Himalayan nation. [This statement

Nepal has about 150 elephants in the wild and about 100 domesticated
pachyderms, some of which are used in safaris by private hotels and
state-run national parks. Elephants are a protected species in Nepal
and killing them carries a jail term of up to 15 years.

[_Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ is a threat to captive elephants
worldwide; the high incidence of TB among humans in Asia makes it
likely that many elephants are infected. Infected elephants, on their
part, expose humans to infection.
Since elephants can also be infected by _M. bovis_, differentiation
on the laboratory level is required, though the reported cases in
Nepalese elephants are likely to be caused by _M. tuberculosis_.
For USDA-APHIS guidelines for the control of tuberculosis in elephants, see
<http://www.aphis.usda.gov/ac/TBGuidelines2003.pdf>.
The guidelines include, among others, chapters on Principles of
Anti-tuberculosis Therapy and on Anti-tuberculosis Drugs.
