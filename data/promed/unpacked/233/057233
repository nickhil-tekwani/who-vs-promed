The coronavirus pandemic is thwarting the fight to eradicate measles as scientists warn outbreaks across the world have surged over the last 4 years.

A report published by the World Health Organisation and US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says between 2016 and 2020, cases shot up to 869 770.

This is the most reported cases since 1996 and a rise of around a staggering 556 percent.

Yet in 2016 the number of cases globally was 132 490 a drop from 853 479 in the year 2000.

Dr Natasha Crowcroft, lead author of the measles report and the WHO's senior technical advisor on measles and rubella, warned global efforts such as immunisation programmes are being hindered by the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak.

Measles cases have soared by around a staggering 556 percent.

The current pandemic means public health and lab resources have been diverted away from their usual detection activities.

The WHO/CDC report is based on the number of measles cases reported to health organisations like the WHO and UNICEF annually by countries around the world.

The sharp rise in cases is despite the fact 193 countries have access to laboratory testing through the WHO's Global Measles and Rubella Laboratory Network.

Dr Natasha Crowcroft said the global community should be "extremely concerned" about the jump in cases which was a "collective failure".

She said: "We should be extremely concerned about this surge in measles cases and related deaths. "That anyone should die from measles -- against which a safe, effective and affordable vaccine has existed for over 50 years -- is a collective failure which must be addressed.

'We need to strengthen health systems and immunization programmes to protect children better."

The measles expert said progress towards eradication of the disease has "stalled globally", with vaccination coverage having remained around 85 percent for several years.

She added coverage needs to be "at least 95 percent" in order to keep the disease at bay, and that outbreaks are caused as the number of children missing out on a jab accumulates over time.

The pandemic may have the effect of distorting the true number of measles cases.

Dr Crowcroft says measles reports in 2020 are down from 2019 but says "it is more ominous than reassuring".

"We are just storing up trouble for future years unless we take action soon, by ensuring the lifesaving benefits of vaccines reach everyone, everywhere," she said.

"What we see on the ground is that a country may not see anything for a couple of years, and then suddenly an outbreak explodes, affecting all the age groups that missed out on vaccination.

"Mathematically speaking, infectious diseases follow exponential, not linear processes. As human beings we tend to be more comfortable thinking linearly, so infectious diseases can take us by surprise because they don't behave that way."

She remains optimistic that antivaccination movements are still "very much a minority". However she said governments, media outlets, and educators need to continue to "tackle misinformation" on the matter.

Last month [October 2020] Facebook introduced a ban on ads that discourage people from getting vaccinated. The company added that ads advocating for or against legislation or government policies around vaccines, including a COVID-19 vaccine, would still be allowed.

[The decline in measles vaccination is understandable in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic that is taking all the attention of care providers and supporting laboratories.

The decline in measles vaccination before the pandemic is not. It would be important to understand where the barriers are to effective vaccination that would bring coverage up to the needed 95%. One hopes that once the current COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, attention and efforts will again turn to bringing the percentages of children vaccinated up to the levels necessary to avoid cases and outbreaks of that disease. - Mod.TY]
