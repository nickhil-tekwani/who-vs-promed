[2] Tajikistan - response: WHO/EURO: RFI
Date: Tue 8 Jun 2021
Source: WHO EURO
https://www.euro.who.int/en/countries/tajikistan/news/news/2021/6/tajikistan-completes-first-round-of-supplemental-immunization-campaign-against-polio


Over 1.2 million children have received 2 drops of oral polio vaccine (OPV) in Tajikistan in the past week, in the 1st round of a campaign to stop circulation of vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) detected in the country. This represents 99% of the children targeted to receive vaccination during this campaign.

Since November 2020, 14 children presenting with acute flaccid paralysis have been diagnosed with poliomyelitis (polio). Due to the efficiency of the disease surveillance system, Tajikistan was able to detect and report the 1st poliomyelitis cases in the country since 2010. The cases are all linked to an imported virus strain currently circulating in Pakistan. Detection of poliovirus in Tajikistan triggered an international response, with WHO and Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) partners working closely with the national authorities to interrupt transmission and ensure that Tajikistan and the WHO European Region remain polio free. The high coverage of vaccination during the 1st round ensures that this is possible, and no child will be missed.

The campaign, which began on 31 May [2021], aims to vaccinate all children under the age of 6 with 2 doses of OPV. It is led by the Centre for Immunoprophylaxis of the Ministry of Health and Social Protection of the Population of Tajikistan and supported by WHO, the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), and other partners within the GPEI.

"Keeping polio out of this Region is an ongoing effort. We must continue to be vigilant at all times, even when faced with other health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. It is vitally important that all children in Tajikistan receive the protection they deserve, and we at WHO are committed to working with the national authorities to ensure that no one is left at risk," said Dr Hans Henri P. Kluge, WHO Regional Director for Europe.

Protecting every child through vaccination
Tajikistan is a mountainous country with many small, remote villages that must all be reached during the nationwide campaign.

"Polio vaccination is available at the primary health care facilities, smaller health-care points, and via outreach teams," explains Farukh Murodzoda, a feldsher working in one of the health-care points in Vakhsh district in southwestern Tajikistan. His health-care point catchment area includes the villages affected by the flash floods and mudflows in mid-May [2021]. While the response to the natural disaster is still ongoing, Farukh and his colleagues will provide polio vaccination to children at the temporary first aid point set up in one of the affected villages. "In my catchment area, I have to vaccinate 679 children, and it is very important to have all of them protected against polio."

A significant part of the work of launching an immunization campaign is ensuring that parents are informed and motivated to have their children vaccinated. Social mobilization and raising awareness about the campaign is carried out largely by the health-care workforce.

"We were notified about the vaccination by our nurse," said Fotima, a mother of 2 children, aged 2 and 4, who received their vaccine at the primary health care facility in Vakhsh city. Like most parents waiting outside of the vaccination point, Fotima was encouraged to vaccinate her children by the family nurse during the household visits. The social mobilization efforts of community leaders and teachers boosted the door-to-door campaign delivered by health-care workers and helped to spread the word about the vaccination even in remote areas.

Supporting polio-free Tajikistan
WHO/Europe and the Country Office in Tajikistan provide comprehensive support to the Government of Tajikistan to prevent the spread of polio and protect children from this crippling disease. The outbreak response measures include strengthening of the surveillance system, planning and monitoring of the supplemental immunization campaign, and supporting community mobilization.

"Today, Tajikistan is the goalkeeper for maintaining the whole Region's polio-free status through a vigilant surveillance system and efficient immunization efforts," said Dr Victor Olsavszky, WHO Representative in Tajikistan. "We are grateful to all the health workers, doctors, and nurses involved in the immunization campaign for their hard work and dedication. It is the joint responsibility of the government, health workers, national and international partners, community leaders, and, of course, parents to ensure that every child is protected from poliomyelitis and its dangerous complications."

The supplemental campaign is being conducted using novel oral polio vaccine type 2 (nOPV2). This improved oral polio vaccine provides comparable protection against poliovirus to the standard monovalent oral polio vaccine type 2, while being more genetically stable and therefore less likely to revert into a form that can cause paralysis in under-immunized communities.

[The long-awaited distribution and use of the nOPV2 (novel oral poliovirus vaccine type 2) is being employed in Tajikistan in response to their ongoing cVDPV2 outbreak, associated with a virus genetically related to the cVDPV2 virus identified and circulating in Pakistan. The nOPV2 is considered more stable than the OPV2 virus and is felt to represent a way to break the cycle of responses to cVDPV2 outbreaks using the monovalent OPV2, which then reverts in neurovirulence and starts another cycle of cVDPV2 outbreak transmission. As of late March 2021, 5 countries have been verified ready to use nOPV: Benin, Liberia, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, and Tajikistan. A total of 22 countries in Africa, 1 in Europe, and 4 in the Middle East have applied for verification. (https://www.unicef.org/executiveboard/media/5501/file/2021_AS-SFS-Polio_Global_Overview-Information_note-EN-2021.05.20.pdf has a good map of the verification process ongoing.)

Note that the above report mentions 14 confirmed cases, whereas the GPEI/WHO update this week mentions 7 cases: 6 in 2021 and 1 in 2020. Clarification of the number of confirmed cases as well as the geographic areas affected would be greatly appreciated.

Officially declared eradicated from the African continent on [25 Aug 2020] by the WHO, polio has yet again surfaced in Senegal. Its tentacles have been installed with a new strain of the virus found in Camberene's sewage. Even worse, 12 cases have been reported in several regions during this year [2021], a situation that led the Ministry of Health and Social Action to initiate catch-up days for polio vaccination from [17-19 Jun 2021] throughout the territory, with the exception of the region of Diourbel, in order to fight against the disease, which handicaps the lower limbs of the child.

For the 1st time, Senegal has just reported a new strain of polio [cVDPV2] different from the one that had circulated in the country. Present in the sub-region [West Africa] with the exception of Cape Verde and Mauritania,for more than 5 years, this derivative of wild polio has already claimed 12 victims in several regions of Senegal. However, that of Diourbel remained the most affected with 6 cases including 5 in Touba. The authorities of the Ministry of Health and Social Action who held a press conference yesterday, Wednesday [9 Jun 2021], informed: "The circulation of the virus in the country is noted during the current year [2021]."

For doctor Ousseynou Badiane, the vaccination program coordinator, "it is through the samples taken in the Camberene wastewater treatment plants as part of epidemiological surveillance that we discovered the presence of the poliovirus. And our investigations have enabled us to identify cases in several regions of the country including Diourbel with the localities of Touba and Bambey, Thies with Tivaouane, Dakar with Mbao and, finally, Sokone." And to continue: "The return of polio is a result of the coronavirus pandemic, which led many parents to desert health establishments for vaccination sessions."

Faced with this situation, the Ministry of Health and Social Action, which had laid the groundwork by organizing vaccination sessions in the most affected region, namely Diourbel, beginning on 17 Jun 2021 will move a higher level. To this end, all children 3.5 months who have not been vaccinated against polio will be enrolled during this campaign. "These are remedial days that will be organized throughout the exempted country the region of Diourbel until [19 Jun 2021]."

Regarding the type of vaccine, the health authorities have informed that it will be done with the injectable vaccine [IPV - inactivated polio vaccine]. "Inactivated poliovirus is used in the injectable vaccine but if we do not obtain the expected result, we go orally [using the OPV - oral poliovirus vaccine] with several [vaccination rounds] until the disease is eradicated," suggested Dr Badiane.

As a reminder, for 7 years, Senegal has not reported a case of polio, which remains a very contagious disease caused by the polio virus. It invades the nervous system and can lead to paralysis or even death within hours. It generally affects children and causes disabilities in them, the most visible of which is paralysis of the lower limbs. Without treatment, the vaccine remains the only alternative to prevent the said disease.

[While Senegal is currently involved with ongoing discussions related to verification of eligibility to use the nOPV2 (https://www.unicef.org/executiveboard/media/5501/file/2021_AS-SFS-Polio_Global_Overview-Information_note-EN-2021.05.20.pdf), it appears as though the country is opting to use IPV (trivalent) to raise immunity levels and interrupt transmission of the ongoing cVDPV2 outbreak. One suspects they are hoping to avoid the vicious cycle of mOPV2 control followed by cVDPV2 outbreak associated with the mOPV2 used to interrupt a prior outbreak. One also suspects the game plan is to try using IPV, and if that doesn't work, the country will have been verified for nOPV2 use. A commendable strategy based on lessons learned in other countries.

While the above report mentions a total of 12 cases of AFP associated with the outbreak, the official report in this week's GPEI mentions only 4 confirmed cases. Clarification of this would be greatly appreciated. - Mod.MPP]

[4] Philippines - Outbreak declared over
Date: Fri 11 Jun 2021
Source: WHO / UNICEF Joint News Release [edited]
https://www.who.int/philippines/news/detail/11-06-2021-who-unicef-laud-end-of-polio-outbreak-in-the-philippines


WHO and UNICEF Philippines, on behalf of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI), commend the Department of Health (DOH), government agencies, partners, and civil society efforts that have ended the polio outbreak in the Philippines. The DOH officially concluded the polio outbreak response on [3 Jun 2021]. The decision came as the virus has not been detected in a child or in the environment in the past 16 months and is a result of comprehensive outbreak response actions including intensified immunization and surveillance activities in affected areas of the country.

The DOH announced a polio outbreak in the Philippines on [19 Sep 2019] after 19 years of being polio-free. Since then, the government, together with WHO, UNICEF, and partners, scaled nationwide polio campaigns to stop the spread of the virus. Despite the tremendous challenges to immunization presented by the simultaneous impact of COVID-19, the DOH continued robust polio immunization campaigns. In particular, UNICEF and WHO commend the DOH for enhancing training and mobilizing health workers in infection prevention and control, and supplying them with personal protective equipment to be able to vaccinate children in their homes and in designated health centers, a global 1st in a country experiencing community transmission of COVID-19.

WHO supported the country's polio outbreak response by providing both technical and operations support on intensifying polio surveillance, planning, preparing for, and monitoring of immunization campaigns, infection prevention and control measures, and risk communication. WHO also deployed international and national polio experts who provided on-the-ground technical support to the regions and local implementers.

"This is a major win for public health and is an excellent example of what collective efforts can attain, even in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. The closure of the polio outbreak is a direct result of strong political will and government leadership, the mobilization and engagement of resources and communities, the courage and commitment of healthcare and front-line workers, and the combined, coordinated efforts of the local governments and partners," said Dr Rabindra Abeyasinghe, WHO Representative to the Philippines. "We look forward for these efforts to be sustained for a strong and resilient immunization system, utilizing the investments made for polio outbreak response and COVID-19 vaccination to ensure all children are protected from vaccine preventable diseases as the Philippines moves towards achieving Universal Health Care," Dr Abeyasinghe added.

UNICEF supported the Department of Health through vaccine procurement and delivery, development of immunization guidelines, social mobilization, engaging community members and influencers, and building the capacity of DOH and LGU staff nationwide to plan and ensure that no child was missed.

"The success of the polio immunization in the Philippines is proof that when we come together for children, great things happen. UNICEF celebrates all the vaccine champions and partners who made this possible. We must keep the momentum and accelerate routine immunization and safeguard essential child health services while rolling out COVID-19 vaccines for priority groups," UNICEF Philippines Representative Oyunsaikhan Dendevnorov says.

Aside from WHO and UNICEF, other core partners of the GPEI -- Rotary International, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance -- also supported the Philippine polio outbreak response.

WHO has outlined recommendations to the DOH to ensure systems are in place to protect the gains from the polio outbreak response. These include giving high priority to quality poliovirus surveillance; developing quarterly surveillance desk reviews between DOH and WHO; protecting human resources involved in immunization; regular reporting to WHO on human resource deployment, vaccine procurement and surveillance performance; developing best practices manual for field level users; and updating material inventories.

[Note that the sequence of reports presents the somewhat gloomy report confirming continued transmission of WPV1 in Pakistan, plus cVDPV transmission in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Burkina Faso, followed by a somewhat less gloomy report of the successful control activities implemented in Tajikstan including the use of the nOPV2 for the control program. This is then followed by the report from Senegal, with a mildly gloomy tone, given the circulation of the cVDPV2, but the optimistic approach of the government to interrupt transmission and avoid the cycle of recurrent cVDPV2 outbreaks. And last, for those who persevered down the chain of reports in this update, the optimistic report on the interruption of transmission of cVDPV1 and cVDPV2 in the Philippines. - Mod.MPP
