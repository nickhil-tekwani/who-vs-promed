The post requesting country of origin is well taken. GIDEON notes that the
cases imported into Japan in 1999 included 5 from the Philippines and 3
from Thailand. Although the Philippines reported 330 cases that year,
Thailand has reported no cases of cholera since 1994. The plot thickens
when we recall that several cases of cholera in Hong Kong during 1998 were
ascribed to Thai cockles [shellfish.

Regarding your request for information about the imported case in the
Netherlands (18 Dec 2000), we have the following data:
The patient is a Dutch woman, aged 52, who was taken ill in the beginning
of December 2000 while vacationing in the Philippines, where she spent time
snorkeling. A non-O1 _Vibrio cholerae_ has been isolated (no further
details available).

[We thank Jan for this information, and for further notification that the
type was also non-O139. Given that _V. cholerae_ types other than O1 and
O139 cause gastroenteritis, not cholera, we believe that this should not be
considered a cholera case. - Mod.JW
