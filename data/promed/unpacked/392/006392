[In 2015, Russia reported to the OIE 17 outbreaks of lumpy skin disease. That event was resolved on 30 Dec 2015 (see event summary and map at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?reportid=18582).

Like the LSD event reported in 2015, vaccination was not applied as a control measure for this current event. - Mod.CRD]

[The reporting of LSD from Krasnodar indicates a significant spread of the disease north-westward within Russia's Northern Caucasus region.

During 2015, the disease was reported from Dagestan, Chechnya, and (the disputed territory) South Ossetia, as well as from Armenia, a former member of the Soviet Union. The 1st outbreak in the region had been reported in July 2014 from Azerbaijan. An OIE world map showing all reported LSD outbreaks since July 2014 is available at http://tinyurl.com/hf9fson (click on Azerbaijan, zoom in).

It would be interesting to obtain information from Georgia about the current LSD situation there. - Mod.AS
