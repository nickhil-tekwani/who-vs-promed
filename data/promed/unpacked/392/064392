[According to the above results, all tested reference virus strains (candidate vaccine strains) have been found distant from the FMDV-A field strain isolated from cattle during the 2015 epizootic in Saudi Arabia. An FMDV-A virus, currently circulating in eastern Turkey, adjacent to the Iranian border, has been found by the Turkish FMD laboratory to be closely related to the Saudi strain and to Indian serotype A strain(s). Samples for final genotyping of the Turkish strain have been sent to WRLFMD at Pirbright, UK. Results are pending.

In a presentation provided by Drs Pattnaik and Subramaniam, from India's FMD reference laboratory (PD-FMD), covering the years 2012-2014, it was shown that the widely applied FMDV-A vaccine strain IND40/2000 poorly matched the circulating serotype A field strains (28.1 percent matching). See page 65 (appendix 4) in OIE/FAO Foot-and-Mouth Disease Reference Laboratory Network Annual Report 2014 at http://www.wrlfmd.org/ref_labs/ref_lab_reports/OIE-FAO%20FMD%20Ref%20Lab%20Network%20Report%202014.pdf.

From the discussion chapter:
"Population dynamics studies indicate a recent genotype demographic transition from genotype 16 to genotype 18 in 2001. Apparently genotypes 16 and 18, both within the Asia topotype, evolved independently but have shared the same geo-ecology in the country, as they are placed quite distantly in the ML tree, emerged from 2 distinct ancestral nodes in the Asia topotype and have followed different evolutionary trajectories. Both these genotypes appear to share their most recent common ancestor with viruses from 2 geographically separate regions. Genotypes 18 and 22 (from the Middle East) descended from a common intermediate node, while genotypes 16 and 20 (from South-east Asia) showed common ancestral linkage.

Strains from Nepal and Saudi Arabia collected during 1984 and 1986, respectively, clustered in genotype 18 and they appear to be intermediates between genotypes 22 and 18. Based on phylogeographical configuration, it might be suggested that the Indian viruses within genotype 18 are descended from a virus related to that from Nepal and that similar ancestral sequences have also circulated in countries of the Arabian Peninsula. The 1996 type A outbreak in Albania and Macedonia has been ascribed to the importation of on-the-bone buffalo meat from South Asia. Also, the virus strains revealed close genetic relationships with the then-circulating strains from India and Saudi Arabia within genotype 18".

"ABSTRACT.
Emergence of genetically and antigenically divergent lineages/genotypes and poor intergenotypic antigenic coverage is a major concern in serotype A foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) in India. In 2009, to cover antigenic diversity emerged in serotype A virus field isolates, IND40/2000 was selected as the new vaccine strain for incorporation in the trivalent FMD vaccine formulation used in India. Although current vaccine strain (IND40/2000) covers most isolates antigenically, a few VP359-deletion group isolates showed low r-value in routine vaccine-matching exercises. The VP359-deletion group within genotype 18 emerged initially in late 2002 and in 2007, causing outbreaks along with non-deletion isolates of the same genotype. In case of emergence or re-emergence of more antigenically divergent isolates in future, a need for a new vaccine candidate to cover maximum isolates of both deletion and non-deletion groups may arise. 4 alternate candidate vaccine strains (IND281/2003, IND195/2007, IND360/2007, and IND123/2008) were selected based on set criteria, and antigenic relationships with field isolates sampled between 2002 and 2009 were analyzed using a micro-neutralization test. Phylogenetic analysis based on capsid region of serotype A isolates revealed existence of 2 broad distinct clusters (VP359-deletion and non-deletion group) within genotype 18.

The VP359-deletion group has diversified genetically with time, giving rise to 3 different sublineages (clades 18a, 18b and 18c). The present study indicates that the virus candidates IND281/2003 (VP359-deletion group) and IND195/2007 (non-deletion group) can be used as an adjunct or alternative strain to the currently used vaccine strain IND40/2000 in case of emergence of more antigenically divergent isolates in future."

The route by which exotic FMD strains (serotypes O and A), probably originating in the Indian subcontinent, have recently been introduced into the Middle East and the Maghreb, is yet to be clarified. India is ranked the world's leading beef exporter. - Mod.AS
