[In response to the ProMED post of 6 May on 2004 - see below - on
confirmation of cutaneous leishmaniasis in Kangaroos in Australia]

_Leishmania_ species infect Kangaroos in Australia
--------------------------------------------------
The full report of leishmaniasis in Red Kangaroos (_Macropus rufus_)
in the Northern Territory of Australia is presented by Rose, K. _et
al_. (2004) - see below.

Basically, ulcerations were found in Red kangaroos housed in a fauna
park outside Darwin and were first reported as presumptive cutaneous
leishmaniasis on 18 Jun 2003
(<http://www.oie.int/eng/info/hebdo/AIS_12.HTM>).

Detailed investigations have since confirmed that the infection is
due to _Leishmania_ parasites, but molecular characterisation of the
parasites from skin lesions show that the parasite species is not _L.
major_ or _L. tropica_, causing CL in the Old World, nor _L.
donovani infantum_ (Old World visceral leishmaniasis), nor _L.
enriettii_ a parasite of laboratory guinea pigs in Brazil, and not
_L. mexicana_ causing CL in Central America. Nevertheless all
infected kangaroos had detectable anti-_Leishmania_ antibodies. The
conclusion was that the parasites infecting kangaroos are probably a
new species of _Leishmania_.

Although imported cases of CL have been recorded from soldiers
returning from overseas and immigrants and also from dogs,
leishmaniasis transmission in Australia has not previously been
recorded. Worldwide vectors of leishmaniasis are phlebotomine
sandflies, but until now Australia has been considered free of
suitable vectors.

The present findings indicate that the parasites were somehow
imported into Australia and that phlebotomine sandflies transmitted
the parasites to the Kangaroos. There is the possibility of human
transmission of leishmaniasis in Australia, especially as most forms
of leishmaniasis infecting humans are zoonoses.
