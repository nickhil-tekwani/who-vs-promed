[On the previous posting, ProMED-mail post 20070516.1562, one of the
moderators commented: "However, in Africa, giraffe graze on the leaves of
trees so are unlikely to have oral contact with bovine feces on the ground,
whereas in wildlife parks in the USA and other countries, I should think
they are given their feed on the ground." - Mod.JW]
Giraffe are usually fed from elevated feeders in captivity, but water is
often offered at ground level, sometimes in natural-looking "ponds" without
vertical barrier-type sides, which the animals may walk into before
drinking. Treats may also fall to the ground and be picked up by the
animals from there.
