First report of the natural occurrence of 8 viruses affecting soybeans in Iran
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A R Golnaraghi (Research and Science Branch, Islamic Azad University, P.O.
Box 14515- 775, Tehran, Iran), N R Shahraeen (Plant Virology Department,
Plant Pests and Diseases Research Institute, P.O. Box 19395-1454, Tehran,
Iran), R Pourrahim (as for Shahraeen), and A Ghasemi (Oilseed Research and
Development Co., Tehran, Iran). Accepted for publication 15 Mar 2002.

During the summer of 1999/2000, a survey of viruses infecting soybeans was
conducted in 5 main soybean cultivation provinces of Iran (Golestan,
Mazandaran, Ardebil, Lorestan and Khuzestan). ... 3110 leaf samples were
collected randomly from 80 soybean fields (30 to 50 samples per field).
Samples were tested ... by ELISA for the presence of 13 viruses ... using
antisera against [bromoviruses- Alfalfa mosaic, (AlMV), Tobacco streak
(TSV) (As-0171, PV-0309); comoviruses - Tobacco ringspot (TRSV); Tomato
ringspot (ToRSV) [Sanofi, France]; cucomoviruses - Cucumber mosaic (CMV);
luteoviruses - Pea enation mosaic virus-1 (PEMV-1) [Iranian pea isolate
provided by Farzadfar]; potyviruses - Bean common mosaic (BCMV) [Adgen
Diagnostic, UK]; Bean yellow mosaic (BYMV); Blackeye cowpea mosaic (BlCMV)
[from Pinnow, USA]; Peanut mottle virus (PeMoV) [Seed Pathology Institute,
Denmark]; Soybean mosaic virus (SMV); tobamoviruses - Tobacco mosaic virus
(TMV); and tospoviruses - Tomato spotted wilt (TSWV) (As-0526, As-0580,
PV-0526) [DSMZ, Germany].
BlCMV and PeMoV were tested for by immuno-dot ELISA, and the others ... by
DAS-ELISA]. Laboratory tests results indicated that the overall viral
disease incidence was 15.7 percent. SMV was the most common virus, with an
average of 13.3 percent, followed by TSWV (5.4 percent), TRSV (4.2
percent), TSV (4.1 percent), PEMV (2.9 percent), BYMV (2.2 percent), ToRSV
(2.1 percent), TMV (1.5 percent), AlMV (1.3 percent), BCMV (0.8 percent)
and CMV (0.6 percent). In addition, BlCMV was detected in selected
symptomatic samples from Mazandaran and Lorestan, and PeMoV in samples from
Golestan.
Field symptoms associated with virus infection included: mosaic, mottling,
crinkle, vein clearing and vein necrosis with SMV; mosaic and mottling with
AlMV, BCMV, BlCMV, BYMV, PEMV, PeMoV and TMV; top necrosis in most TRSV-
and ToRSV-infected plants; chlorosis and necrosis with TSWV. ... Plants
were frequently infected with more than one virus, so it was not possible
to correlate specific symptoms with a particular virus.
SMV, TSV, TRSV, ToRSV and TSWV [were] previously recorded in soybean in
Iran (Eskandari, 1978; Rahimian et al., 1995; Golnaraghi et al., 2001) and
AlMV, BCMV, BYMV, CMV, PEMV-1 and PeMoV [had] been previously reported from
other hosts (Kaiser et al., 1971; Shahraeen and Bananej, 1995).
[We believe that] ... this is the first report of naturally occurring
infections of AlMV, BCMV, BlCMV, BYMV, CMV, PEMV-1, PeMoV and TMV in
soybean fields in Iran.

[Of the 13 reports above, 8 are for first reports of the presence of new
plant viruses in Iran, rather an impressive array. Many of them
(cucomoviruses and potyviruses) are seedborne, suggesting that infected
seed may have been used in some plantings, although some of these viruses
may have reservoirs in native vegetation from which they spread to the
planted crops. The detection of a tobamovirus in soybean is somewhat
unexpected. It's possible that the soybean virus was Sunn hemp mosaic
tobamovirus. Perhaps our Iranian authors or other plant virologists can
provide more information on this particular virus. What are missing from
this and similar reports are data on crop losses. Perhaps such data will be
provided in future reports. - Mod.DH]
