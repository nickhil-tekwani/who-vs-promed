A horse in Cumberland County was euthanized after contracting a mosquito-borne disease, the state's Department of Agriculture said Tuesday [30 Jul 2019]. The horse, a 4-year-old mare, was not vaccinated against eastern equine encephalomyelitis (EEE). It was the 1st case of the disease in North Carolina this year [2019], the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services said.

The disease causes inflammation of the brain and is usually fatal. It can take between 3 and 10 days for signs to show after a horse has been bitten by an infected mosquito. Signs include impaired vision, aimless wandering, inability to swallow, irregular gait, paralysis, convulsions and death.

State Veterinarian Dr. Doug Meckes said in a statement any horses with such signs to contact a veterinarian immediately. "It is imperative horse owners keep their vaccines current, talk to your veterinarian about vaccinating them as soon as possible against EEE and West Nile virus," Meckes said. He recommended a booster shot every 6 months.

Because mosquitos breed in puddles, removing standing water can reduce the chance of exposure to the disease. While people, horses and birds can become ill from an infected mosquito, there is no evidence horses can transmit the virus to other horses, birds or people through direct contact.

The Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection (DATCP) and the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory confirm a horse in Barron County tested positive for Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE), Wisconsin's 1st confirmed EEE case this year [2019]. The 22-year-old quarter horse mare had not been vaccinated against EEE, and was euthanized after showing neurological signs and becoming unable to rise.

EEE and West Nile virus (WNV) are transmitted by mosquitoes carrying these viruses, which can affect the nervous system and may be fatal. DATCP encourages horse owners to vaccinate their horses against these viruses to prevent the disease signs and high levels of fatality associated with them. EEE is fatal in more than 90% of clinical cases in horses while WNV is fatal in 30-40%.

"From an animal welfare perspective, vaccinating horses against EEE and WNV is necessary to prevent the suffering that occurs once the horse contracts the virus," said Dr. Julie McGwin, DATCP equine program veterinarian. "While the number of cases of EEE and WNV were down last year [2018] compared to the previous year, it is heartbreaking for all involved to see any animal suffer through deteriorating health conditions caused by these viruses. We encourage all horse owners to work with their veterinarian to get their horses vaccinated against these diseases."

In 2018, Wisconsin had a total of 2 cases of EEE and 3 cases of WNV reported. In comparison, Wisconsin had a record 24 confirmed cases reported of each virus in 2017. There are currently no reports of WNV cases this year [2019].

The virus is not contagious between horses. While humans may also be infected by WNV and EEE, the viruses do not pass directly between people and horses. Mosquitoes carry the viruses from infected birds and the only route of transmission is from a mosquito bite.

Because the viruses follow mosquito populations, the threat varies depending on the weather but normally starts in mid to late summer and remains until the 1st killing frost. For more information about EEE and WNV including signs, the vaccination process, and how to limit exposure to mosquitoes, visit DATCP's website at https://datcp.wi.gov/Pages/Programs_Services/HorsesEEEWNV.aspx.

DATCP's Division of Animal Health monitors animal health and disease threats, promotes humane treatment of animals, and provides licensing and registration regulation for animals in Wisconsin.

[At what point do we realize the message of "Vaccinate to protect your animals" is falling on many deaf ears? When do we hold vaccination clinics for horse or cows? We can regulate and say those going to any type of gathering (e.g., rodeo, show, roping, dressage) must have a certificate of veterinary inspection and vaccination records or they do not participate. But what about the so-called backyard horse or the pasture ornament horse or the cow horse never leaving the back 40 [acres]? They all need vaccination.

Some municipalities have tried mosquito control, which can be helpful, but is likely not to be effective for the animals on the farms and ranches. Mosquito control on the premise is important. Dump those old tires and flowerpot catch basins and anywhere else water can stand. These are prime breeding places for mosquitoes. Eliminate the mosquito, and we would desperately decrease the mosquito-vectored diseases in our animals and people. - Mod.TG
