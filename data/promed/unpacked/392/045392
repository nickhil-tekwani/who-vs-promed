[1] Cholera - Zambia (Northern Province)

Cholera, which was recorded in Mpulungu in January 2014, has persisted, although there is a decline in the number of new infections.

Acting Northern Province medical officer Lawrence Phiri said the fear was that the water-borne disease, which thrives in unsanitary conditions, would now spread to the flooded areas of Kaputa District.

Dr Phiri was briefing Health Minister Joseph Kasonde, who is in Northern Province to flag off government health projects. He said a team of medical personnel had arrived in Kaputa and begun distributing chlorine to disinfect contaminated water supplies. "Only Mungwi has above 50 per cent of health centres having more than 2 qualified staff," he said.

The health worker ratio for the province was at 40 per cent per 100 000 population, translating into one health worker for a population of 2500. The province, however, had adequate essential medicines and other medical supplies in the past year as all health facilities reported above 87 per cent availability.

[2] Cholera - Namibia
Date: Fri 21 Mar 2014

Namibia Red Cross volunteers head out to share messages on cholera prevention with villagers near the capital. As we wind our way past homes, down muddy tracks bordered by rubbish, I wonder how much more we will have to walk to reach the home of the woman with the pleading eyes. It is a hot day in this informal settlement on the outskirts of Namibia's capital, Windhoek, as 5 teams of Namibia Red Cross Society volunteers navigate similar winding routes in the heat and rain.

We are here to assess the situation in the informal settlements after a cholera outbreak in early February 2014. This is the 1st time cholera has been identified in Windhoek. It is a different strain from the outbreak which is affecting northern regions, and as of yet, there is no indication it will spread through the capital. However, health care workers are concerned. There have now been 39 suspected cases of cholera in Windhoek, with 3 confirmed cases. Following the death of a 60-year-old man in Katutura, just 8 km outside the capital, the Namibia Red Cross Society moved quickly. Five teams of volunteers were deployed to conduct 25 interviews with residents to better understand the situation and plan a response.

All over Windhoek's informal settlements, streets are overcrowded, and there is a lack of basic toilet facilities. In Katutura, where the 1st death from cholera was recorded, an estimated 200 000 people live in a settlement that is designed for less than 45 000 people. The toilets which are available are located near houses and are often broken. Water from broken toilets and other sources runs down roads and pools in dips in roads and shallow drains. Along these roads, children play with tires, rolling them through the dirt and water nearby.

Since November 2013, Namibia has been affected by cholera outbreaks which have affected the northern regions of Kunene, Omusati, Oshana and Ohangwena. 504 cases have been recorded, with 16 deaths. Education is critical, both for prevention and early treatment. If patients are treated early, the fatality rate can be less than one percent. If people go untreated, the severe, watery diarrhea and vomiting can kill within hours.
