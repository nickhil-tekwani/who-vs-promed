The Tocantins State Department of Health in Central Brazil has reported 14 confirmed cases of Chagas disease after a family consumed contaminated juice in Aparecida do Rio Negro, according to a Globo.com report [computer translated]. All the infected are from the same family and drank the juice of the bacaba, a type of palm tree from the Amazon. The farm where the juice was produced is in the rural area of Aparecida do Rio Negro. The entire region will go through a sanitary surveillance survey next week [week of 17 Dec 2018] to prevent further cases.

It is suspected that feces of the ["barbeiro" or barber bug], which transmits the disease, contaminated the juice. The family was gathered for the 2nd round of the general election and most do not live in the city.

Chagas disease is found mainly in endemic areas of 21 Latin American countries where infection is transmitted mostly by vectors to humans by contact with feces or urine of triatomine bugs (known as "kissing bugs", among many other popular names).

About 6 to 7 million people worldwide are estimated to be infected with _Trypanosoma cruzi_, the parasite that causes Chagas disease. There is no vaccine against Chagas disease. Control of vectors in homes and screening women of childbearing age and blood donors (to prevent placental transmission and transmission by transfusion) remain the most effective methods of preventing transmission in Latin America.
