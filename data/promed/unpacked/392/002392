This posting from Ms Christina Foster mentions that France has 15 human
cases of the human form of the disease, variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease,
since it first appeared in 1996.
I would like to provide more recent information. France has recorded 21
cases of definite and probable variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease since
1996, including 3 cases still alive.
Reports are published monthly by the National Institute for Public Health
Surveillance (Institut de Veille Sanitaire) at
<http://www.invs.sante.fr/publications/mcj/donnees_mcj.html>.
