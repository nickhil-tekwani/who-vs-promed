Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comment: One layer farm in Pingtung County and one layer farm and one duck farm in Yunlin County were sampled by the local Livestock Disease Control Centre (LDCC) in the process of intensified surveillance around infected holdings. Another chicken farm in Yunlin County was reported by the owner and was sampled by the LDCC. These samples had been sent to the National Laboratory, Animal Health Research Institute (AHRI) for analysis. Highly pathogenic avian influenza H5 subtype was confirmed by AHRI on [17 Jan, 10 Feb, 8 Jul and 20 Apr 2018]. These farms have been placed under movement restriction. All animals in these infected farms have been culled. Thorough cleaning and disinfection have been conducted after stamping out operations. Surrounding poultry farms within a 3-km radius of the infected farms are under intensified surveillance for 3 months.

Control measures
Measures applied: movement control inside the country; surveillance outside containment and/or protection zone; surveillance within containment and/or protection zone; quarantine; official disposal of carcasses, by-products and waste; stamping out; disinfection; ante and post-mortem inspections; vaccination prohibited; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

[Since 2015 to date, Taiwan also continues to have an active event associated with HPAI H5N2. The situation for that event is as follows:

HPAI H5N2: Event started in January 2015; 838 outbreaks reported, and the event still continuing. According to the latest follow-up report No. 107 on 8 Aug 2018, 2 outbreaks were reported in Yunlin County, see http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapEventSummary&reportid=27486.

See event summary and updated map: http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=16936.

Although these reported outbreaks occurred between January and June 2018, there is a high likelihood that they are related to the HPAI H5N2 event. - Mod.CRD
