Woman catches bovine TB from garden badgers, report claims
----------------------------------------------------------
A former veterinary nurse who contracted bovine tuberculosis (TB) is
believed to have caught the disease from badgers that strayed into
her garden. In a leaked report, scientists said badgers were the
"likely source" of bovine TB infection in a woman in Cornwall last
year [2007]. Her daughter and her dog also tested positive for the disease.

The report, which has been submitted for possible publication in
scientific journal Thorax, has raised fears over the threat of bovine
TB to human health. The report found the infection was the strain
found circulating in cattle and badgers in south west Cornwall. It
concluded the most likely cause of infection was due to an encounter
with badgers "known to inhabit her garden."

A source from the NFU said the woman could have inhaled urine from
infected badgers after touching grass or soil.

Bovine TB is known to spread to humans but occurrences are rare. In
2006 and 2007, there were 20 cases nationally of bovine TB in humans,
with 8 of these in the south west of England. Prior to this case,
only 2 cases of bovine TB had been found in dogs in the past 20 years.

[The above case, involving Bov TB in a veterinary nurse and her dog,
was comprehensively described in posting 20080903.2751, which
included detailed commetaries on Bov TB in animals and in man, as
well as excerpts from the booklet "Dealing with Bovine TB in your
herd," issued cooperatively by DEFRA, the Scottish Government, and
the Wales Authority Government (updated May 2008).

We concluded, "the results of the investigation into the current
case, exploring the route of human infection directly from a bovine
or a badger, or rather via the intermediary infection in the dog, are
expected with interest." This has been now partly addressed; the
publication of the complete, approved paper is anticipated with
interest. - Mod.AS]

[The news release is too vague to be assured of the source of _M.
bovis_ that caused this veterinary nurse's pulmonary tuberculosis
(the prior post - Bovine tuberculosis, human, canine - UK:
(England) 20080903.2751, said she had a respiratory infection). To
cause pulmonary tuberculosis, she would have had to inhale an
infectious aerosol. Of the 3 possible sources -- cattle, her dog, or
the badgers in her garden -- the badgers would seem to be the least
likely source, unless grass or soil contaminated by the badgers was
aersolized, for example, by mowing. It is doubtful that she "inhaled"
[aeroslized] urine from infected badgers after touching grass or
soil, as this news release presumes. She more likely had exposure to
the respiratory secretions of infected cattle she may have taken care
of or her dog. The report once it is published in a scientific
journal should be enlightening. - Mod.ML]
