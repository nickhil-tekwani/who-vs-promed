[An administrative map of Lebanon is available at http://images.nationmaster.com/images/motw/atlas_middle_east/lebanon_divisions.jpg. A HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map is available at http://healthmap.org/r/9ZCr.

A total number of 34 lumpy skin disease (LSD) outbreaks have been covered in the 3 notifications submitted by Lebanon to the OIE from the reported start of the epizootic on 28 Nov 2012, until its declared being resolved, on 18 Mar 2013.

The mention of "swill feeding" among the sources of infection will require clarification. Swill is generally known as kitchen refuse and scraps of waste food for feeding to pigs. LSD is an arthropod-borne disease, generally not spreading by other means/fomites, though some direct infections within cattle herds have been suspected, and spread of the virus by contaminated injection-needles and other surgical equipment has been registered.

For a map of the LSD situation in the region since the start of the epizootic in 2012, subscribers are referred to the OIE map at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/Diseaseoutbreakmaps (select lumpy skin disease, period from 1 Jan 2012, centre, and zoom in). In addition to Lebanon, the disease has been reported during 2012 and/or 2013 from Israel, Turkey, Jordan, the Palestinian Authority (West Bank), Iraq, Egypt (where LSD has been endemic since the late 1980s), and Kurdistan. It may be assumed that the LSD virus has also been circulating in other countries in the region, particularly Syria.

LSD is not zoonotic. - Mod.AS]
