Indonesia finds bird flu in pigs
--------------------------------
Indonesian researchers have found a strain of bird flu in pigs on the
densely populated island of Java, raising fears that the virus could more
easily spread to humans, the government and scientists said on Saturday [14
May 2005]. The scientist who made the discovery identified the strain found
in the pigs as H5N1, the same version of the virus that has jumped from
chickens to humans elsewhere in Southeast Asia, killing 36 in Vietnam, 12
in Thailand and 4 in Cambodia.
In 2004, Chinese scientists announced they had found the virus in pigs. But
some experts were skeptical, saying it was unclear whether the animals were
truly infected or merely had traces on their skin or snouts.
CA Nidom, the university researcher who discovered the infection in pigs,
said he had found the virus in the blood of 10 pigs out of 20 he checked. A
laboratory in Tokyo conducted the tests, he said. "I found it in the snout
to begin with, but I was doubtful whether this meant they were truly
infected," he said in a telephone interview. "So I then proved it by
finding a matching strain in the blood."
Dr Nana Supriatna, an expert at the Ministry of Agriculture, confirmed the
discovery but declined to give any more details. He said officials were
meeting Saturday to discuss the development.
Nidom said the samples were taken from pigs living 100 yards away from a
chicken farm on Java island that was struck by bird flu during 2004. None
of the pigs showed any signs of illnesses, he said. "I was just curious to
see how far this virus could go," said Nidom, who works at a state-run
university in the Javanese city of Surabaya.
Indonesia has yet to report any case of humans contracting bird flu, but
has reported scores of outbreaks at chicken farms around the sprawling
archipelago. The island of Java is home to more than 1/2 of the country's
210 million people.

[As requested in our previous posting, the said newswire includes data
regarding the (non-) occurrence of clinical symptoms in the infected pigs.
Serological surveillance in exposed humans might provide additional
information of significant epidemiological value. - Mod.AS]
