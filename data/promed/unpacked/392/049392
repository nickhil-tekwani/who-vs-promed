Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) suspected in vaccinated cattle in Bursa
province, Turkey
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We have received the following information from a reliable source:

Cases, suspected to be FMD, have been identified in dairy cattle farms
in the Bursa province, north-west Turkey. It was suspected that some
animals had been infected in spite of their earlier vaccination with a
trivalent vaccine (serotypes A, O, Asia-1).

[In case the suspicion that vaccinated animals have been infected is
confirmed, special attention deserves to be paid to the identification
in north-eastern Turkey, earlier this year (2011), of an Asia-1 virus
strain which may have originated in central Asia (Afghanistan and
Pakistan). According to a recent paper, "the Asia-1 FMDVs currently
circulating in Pakistan and Afghanistan are not efficiently
neutralized by antisera raised against the Asia-1/Shamir vaccine
strain. Thus, new Asia-1 vaccine strains may be required to block the
spread of the current Asia-1 viruses." (see reference below).

In this respect, subscribers are referred also to the following
sources:
1. WRLFMD alert notice of 14 Apr 2011 "FMDV type Asia-1 in Pakistan
and Bahrain presents a threat to Western Eurasia/Middle East",
available at http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_alerts/asia_1_2011.htm.

2. WRLFMD Quarterly Report July-September 2011, issued 26 Oct 2011,
page 16 (Turkey) presents data and map of the 38 samples which had
been received from Turkey until the given date. The respective numbers
(in brackets) of the various serotypes were the following:
O (17); A (3); A+O (1); Asia-1 (3); FMDV-GD (=FMDV genome detected by
RT-PCR, but no virus isolated) (14). As seen in the map, all 3
'Asia-1' isolates were reported from the province Ardahan, East
Anatolia, bordering Georgia and Armenia. For the data and map, see
http://www.wrlfmd.org/ref_labs/ref_lab_reports/OIE-FAO%20FMD%20Ref%20Lab%20Report%20Jul-Sep%202011.pdf.
An administrative map of Turkey, where Bursa on the north west and
Ardahan in the north east can be seen, is available at
http://www.history-map.com/picture/005/administrative-divisions-Turkey.htm.

3. WRLFMD genotyping report of the 3 mentioned FMDV 'Asia-1' isolates
from Ardahan, dated 14 Oct 2011, available at
http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/2011/WRLFMD-2011-00041%20Asia1%20Turkey%202011.pdf.
The Turkish isolates are closely related to Iranian and Pakistani
isolates (2011). Concerning reference viruses, the 3 isolates had an
identity percentage of less than 84 percent with the vaccine strain
"Asia-1/Shamir/ISR/89" which is said to be currently applied.

4. The following comments on the Turkish situation have been derived
from the report of a Training Workshop on the analysis of Turkish and
Iranian (GIS-VET) FMD data, held in Ankara 14-18 March 2011 (pages
12-13):
"At the Quurban time (religious festival) lots of animals are
slaughtered outside official slaughterhouses. The death of these
animals is often not updated on the Turkvet system. This is the
greatest problem. Over 500 outbreaks reported this year (2011);
reports are received from all over Turkey. This is in part down to
increased vigilance due to warnings that were sent out to district
veterinarians about the threat of new Afghanistan lineage (with severe
signs) and the threat of Asia-1 from Iraq and Iran. More laboratory
samples have been [received] than usual as well." The report is
available at
http://www.fao.org/AG/AGAInfo/commissions/docs/Workshop/Workshop_Ankara_march2011/report.pdf.

Noteworthy, the 2011 Quurban festival (Eid-al-Adha), during which
large numbers of large and small ruminants are -- traditionally --
transported from Anatolia to be slaughtered in the
industrialised/urban provinces in the west, was celebrated this year
on 6 Nov. This may have enhanced the (suspected) recent spread of the
virus.

Confirmation or otherwise of the suspected westwards spread reported
and -- in case confirmed -- details on the causative agent (serotype),
and on the affected population (age, vaccination history, clinical
observations) will be helpful. Hopefully, international organisations
are engaged in efforts to have potent vaccines against the new Asia-1
strain available for mass vaccinations.
