Wentworthville [New South Wales] restaurant investigated after mass food poisoning
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A suspected mass outbreak of foodborne illness at a Chinese restaurant at Wenty Leagues is being investigated by the NSW Food Authority.

Up to 35 patrons, including 10 children, were believed to be struck ill after an evening out in September 2015 at the Jasmine Restaurant.

Three of the guests ended up in hospital, including a 7-year-old girl and 4-year-old boy, and an adult who tested positive for salmonellosis.

Fried ice-cream was thought to be the source of the illnesses.

Wenty Leagues chief executive Mark Sheridan said the alleged incident on 23 Sep 2015 was being managed through the proper authorities.

"All inspections have been passed to the satisfaction of council and the food authority and the Jasmine Restaurant continues to trade," Mr Sheridan said.

A group of 59 friends and family had eaten the banquet dinner in honor of a 60th birthday. They included mother who fell violently ill and 2 of her children, who were also affected. "The food seemed nice," she said. "But I did later suspect the fried ice-cream as it was melted inside and didn't look like it normally does."

A NSW Food Authority spokeswoman confirmed the investigation was continuing into the outbreak. "A Prohibition Order relating to the sale of certain food products at the premises was issued by the NSW Food Authority and remains in place," the spokeswoman said.

[The source of the salmonellosis is most likely to be eggs used in the custard base for the ice cream.

A variety of serotypes of _Salmonella enterica_ can be associated with fowl meat and eggs. The serotype here has not been reported. Of note, in chickens, _S._ Enteritidis colonizes internal organs as well as the tissues of the reproductive tract, including the ovaries, oviduct, cloacal and vaginal tissues. From the ovaries, the organism can contaminate the yolk in some eggs, but the majority of salmonellae are deposited from the reproductive tract to the albumen (egg white) close to the yolk membrane or on the vitelline membrane. The contaminating bacteria survive in the albumen as the eggshell forms and persists after eggs are laid.

Eggs are a standard ingredient in most homemade ice cream recipes (http://www.foodsafety.gov/blog/homemadeicecream.html). They add flavor and color, prevent ice crystallization, and make for that smooth and creamy texture. To prevent this ingredient from causing harmful infections, just follow these guidelines for safe cooking and handling. At the FDA, we advise consumers to start with a cooked egg base for ice cream. This is especially important if you're serving people at high risk for foodborne infections: infants, older adults, pregnant women, and those with weakened immune systems.

To make a cooked egg base (also known as a custard base):
1. Combine eggs and milk as indicated in the recipe. (Other ingredients, such as sugar, may be added at this step.)
2. Cook the mixture gently to an internal temperature of 160 degrees F, stirring constantly. The cooking will destroy _Salmonella_, if present. Use a food thermometer to check the temperature of the mixture. At this temperature, the mixture will firmly coat a metal spoon (but please don't lick the spoon if the custard is not fully cooked!).
3. After cooking, chill the mixture before adding other ingredients and freezing.

Other options include using egg substitute products or pasteurized eggs in your ice cream, or find a recipe without eggs.

Fried ice cream (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fried_ice_cream) is a dessert made from a breaded scoop of ice cream that is quickly deep-fried, creating a warm, crispy shell around the still-cold ice cream.

There are conflicting stories about the dessert's origin. Some claim that it was 1st served during the 1893 Chicago World's Fair, where the ice cream sundae was also invented, though in 1894, a Philadelphia company was given credit for its invention, saying: "A small, solid cake of the [ice] cream is enveloped in a thin sheet of pie crust and then dipped into boiling lard or butter to cook the outside to a crisp. Served immediately, the ice cream is found to be as solidly frozen as it was 1st prepared." A 3rd claim, beginning in the 1960s, asserts that fried ice cream was invented by Japanese tempura restaurants.

In the USA, fried ice cream has been associated with Asian cuisine, appearing in reviews of Chinese, Japanese, and Polynesian restaurants in the "Dining Out" section of the New York Times in the 1970s. It also came to be associated with Mexican cuisine, in large part due to national chain Chi-Chi's adopting a fried ice cream made with tortillas and cinnamon as its "signature dessert" when it opened in the early 1980s.

The dessert is commonly made by taking a scoop of ice cream frozen well below the temperature at which ice cream is generally kept, possibly coating it in raw egg, rolling it in cornflakes or cookie crumbs, and briefly deep frying it. The extremely low temperature of the ice cream prevents it from melting while being fried. It may be sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar and a touch of peppermint, though whipped cream or honey may be used as well. The Asian recipe usually uses tempura batter. Mexican versions use corn flakes, nuts, cookie crumbs, or tortillas for coating. Common flavors in Asian restaurants are green tea, vanilla, taro and red bean. - Mod.LL
