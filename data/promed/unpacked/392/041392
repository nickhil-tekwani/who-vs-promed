Cases of hand, foot & mouth disease reappear in Male and Atolls
--------------------------------------------
MALE: On Mon 28 May 2001 the Ministry of Health stated that cases of hand,
foot and mouth disease (HFMD) have appeared in Male and [the] atolls again.
The ministry's director general Dr Abdul Azeez Yoosuf said that cases of
children with the disease had increased since the schools opened after a
break following first-term examinations. He said that cases of HFMD were
not observed during the week when the schools were closed for holidays but
appeared soon after. Dr Azeez said that the disease is appearing in only
some of the atolls.
A senior official from [the] Ministry of Education said that the ministry
was not officially aware that cases of HFMD were reappearing in Male. Some
of the classes in schools of Male were closed for over a month after the
disease appeared in Male for the first time in March this year. Even now
studies in some classes in schools of some atolls have been postponed.
