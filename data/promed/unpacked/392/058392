A warning not to consume pumpkin butter from Oxford County's Birtch Farms and Estate Winery has been issued by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency [CFIA]. The CFIA is advising the pumpkin butter may be contaminated with _Clostridium botulinum_, a bacterium that can produce toxins that cause botulism, a life-threatening illness. The product was sold in 110 millilitre and 250 millilitre jars. It was distributed in Ontario.

"All lot codes are affected by this alert," CFIA said in its warning issued at 1:18 a.m. Tue 20 Nov 2012. Birtch Farms and Estate Winery, located north of Woodstock near Innerkip, is voluntarily recalling the pumpkin butter from the marketplace. There have been no reported illnesses from the product.

According to the CFIA, food contaminated with _Clostridium botulinum_ toxin may not look or smell spoiled. Consumption of food contaminated with the toxin may cause nausea, vomiting, fatigue, dizziness, headache, double vision, dry throat, respiratory failure, and paralysis. In severe cases of illness, people may die.

[Because of the potential severity of botulism, ProMED-mail posts such recalls even if, as in this case, there are no human cases associated with the food products. Most of the food recalls are related to defective preparation procedures, which could, but not necessarily do, result in the germination of viable spores of _C. botulinum_. - Mod.LL]
