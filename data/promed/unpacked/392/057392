At least 13 people have died over the past few days and about 60 others
have reportedly been hospitalized with symptoms of cholera in various
health centres in Bugiri District. According to medical workers in the
area, the disease that erupted early last week causes severe vomiting,
bloody diarrhea, dehydration, and general body weakness. It has mostly hit
the areas of Muwayo trading centre in Buluguyi Sub-county.

The district health officer, Dr Stephen Kirya Bulolo, confirmed the deaths
yesterday afternoon [29 Sep 2009]. He said out of the 80 currently under
intense medical monitoring, 71 are adults, while the rest are children
under 7 years. A health worker, only identified as Sr Namukwana, said new
cases were being registered at health centres every hour. She said stool
samples were taken to Kampala for further examination.

At least 50 cases of cholera have been registered in the north western
region of Rwanda, the Health Ministry said on 29 Sep 2009. No deaths were
reported in the affected region, which had been free of the disease for a
decade.

"Basic hygiene and lack of adequate sanitation in the region are described
as the biggest issue, but medical experts and humanitarian staff have been
deployed to outbreak areas," Gamariel Binamungu, director-general of the
National Reference Laboratory, said. "All necessary medication is being
provided to try to prevent the spread of the disease," he told IRIN.

A fresh outbreak of cholera has hit Chiredzi District in Masvingo province,
where 5 new cases of the disease were reported this week, health officials
have said. This brings to 10 the number of cases that have been reported
over the past week, following another 5 new cases which were reported in
Chipinge in Manicaland Province.

Health officials here said the 5 fresh cases were reported in the Sengwe
Communal along the Mozambican border. "We have deployed personnel to the
affected areas, and the situation is under control," said a senior official
within the Ministry of Health.

Masvingo provincial medical director Robert Mudyirandima said: "I have yet
to get official reports, but it would appear cholera has affected parts of
Mozambique; as such, some of our areas along the border risk being affected."

Officials in the ministry yesterday [29 Sep 2009] said that initial tests
had proven that the reported cases were confirmed to be cholera.

In 2008, thousands of lives were lost due to a cholera epidemic which swept
across Zimbabwe.

[4] Cholera - Congo DR (North Kivu, South Kivu)
Date: Fri 25 Sep 2009

At least 100 people have died of cholera in parts of eastern Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC) since January 2009, say medical sources. South Kivu
Province is the worst affected, with at least 75 people dead and 6392
infected, said Eugene Kabambi, who is in charge of communications at the UN
World Health Organization (WHO) in DRC.

The South Kivu governor, Louis Leonce Muderwa, said the 10 worst-affected
health zones in the province included Fizi in the region of Baraka, Nundu,
Uvira, Kadutu, Ibanda, Bunyakiri, Katana, Minova, Nyantende and Kabare
zones. Two deaths have been reported in Kadutu and one each in Ibanda and
Katana.

Muderwa declared a cholera epidemic there on 14 Sep 2009.

In neighboring North Kivu Province, 48 deaths had been recorded and 4609
people infected by 13 Sep 2009, according to a WHO report.

Five health zones have recorded cases, including the main town of Goma,
Karisimbi, Masisi, Mutwanga, and Rutshuru areas. Other eastern regions have
also recorded cases, with Katanga listing 199 new cases and 2 deaths.

The North Kivu provincial medical inspector, Dominique Bahago, blamed the
cholera outbreaks on poor hygiene. "The majority of the population's supply
of cooking and drinking water is from Lake Kivu, where all kinds of waste
is dumped; cholera is endemic in that zone," said Bahago.

Cramped living conditions in displaced persons camps, as well as the
inconsistent use of latrines, had exacerbated contamination, he said. An
estimated 2 million people are displaced in eastern DRC, some of them
repeatedly since the start of conflict there in 1996.

At least 76 persons have been confirmed dead from a suspected outbreak of
an epidemic of cholera in about 7 local government councils of Adamawa state.

The disease, which manifests with symptoms of vomiting, diarrhea, and mild
fever, is ravaging communities in 7 local government areas of Mubi, north
and south, Maiha, Michika, Madagali, Girie, and Hong in the northern part
of the state.

So far, 76 people have died, while 846 are receiving treatment at the
various state health establishments. Commissioner of information, culture
and tourism, Alhaji Musa Bubakari Kamale, who stated this yesterday [24 Sep
2009] after the weekly executive council meeting, said the government had
dispatched adequate drugs and a medical response team to attend to those
already afflicted with the disease in the affected areas.

[6] Cholera - Pakistan (Punjab)

A sudden outbreak of cholera has taken the life of a child besides
seriously affecting the health of dozens of people in the village Garah
Aashiq of Tehsil Parova, reliable sources reported here on Sunday [27 Sep
2009].

The main reason behind the outbreak of cholera is said to be constant use
of contaminated and polluted water by poor villagers. Dozens of affected
people have been admitted in the local hospital for the last 2 days, whose
families are greatly worried over the pitiable condition of the poor patients.

A water testing team of Peshawar, during its recent visit, has already
declared the water supply system of the tehsil Parova, especially of the
union council Naiveala, severely injurious for health. It said that after
the testing of the water, a number of announcements were also made in the
local mosques in order to convince the people not to drink the contaminated
water, but to no avail, as they have no alternative.

[7] Cholera, non-toxigenic - Russia (Sverdlovsk)
Date: 23 Sep 2009

The Center for Hygiene and Epidemiology of Sverdlovsk Oblast's report on
cholera says: "The epidemic situation for quarantine infections worsened in
several African and Asian countries, especially for cholera. Outbreaks are
being registered, including with lethal outcomes. The situation in the
Russian Federation for quarantine infections is tense because of economic
and transport ties and the high level of immigration from countries which
are endemic for cholera."

1923 samples have been taken from open water bodies in Middle Ural for
surveillance purposes. There were 44 positive cultures for _V. cholerae_
O1/O139 negative (non-toxigenic). Positive cultures came from
Yekaterinburg, Sukhoy Log, Bogdanvich and Kamenskoe rayons. The last rayon
accounted for 82 percent of cultures. There were no positive cultures among
171 specimens from suspected cases.
