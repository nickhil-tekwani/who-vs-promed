India: Mystery Disease Kills 7 Children and 60 Ill in Uddhampur
---------------------------------------------------------------
A 'mystery disease' has killed at least 7 children and made another 60 ill
in 2 villages of Uddhampur district in Jammu and Kashmir over the last few
days, the state's Minister for Health and Medical Education Choudhary Lal
Singh said in Jammu on Fri 20 Feb 2004. The disease, which looks like
measles, had spread in Chad Motto and Chad Panjiyan villages of Ramnagar
tehsil and was brought to the notice of the authorities 2 days ago, Singh
told reporters.
Teams of doctors have been rushed to these villages to treat the affected
children, he said, adding the causes behind the disease were also being
examined to take preventive measures to check its spread. A detailed report
from these areas will be received by this evening and next course of action
would be taken after examining it, he added.

India: 7 Children Die of Mysterious Disease in Kashmir
---------------------------------------------------
7 children have been killed by a mysterious disease in 2 far-flung villages
of the Ramnagar area of the Udhampur district in Kashmir. The disease is
fast spreading, and it is feared it may take the form of an epidemic if
remedial measures are not taken. Most of the families affected by the
disease are poor and living in remote villages. Health minister of Kashmir
Lal Singh told journalists that more and more children are being affected
by the mystery disease and admitted to hospitals.
The disease has not been diagnosed so far, but its symptoms are similar to
[those of] measles, the minister said. Udhampur's Deputy commissioner --
while confirming the death of 7 children -- said that 60 children suffering
from the disease have already been hospitalized.

[Further information on this undiagnosed disease from authoritative sources
in either Pakistan or India would be welcomed. The measles-like nature of
the disease suggests that poor measles vaccine coverage may be responsible
for an outbreak of childhood measles in this troubled area of the world. -
