Yellow fever - Brazil
---------------------
During the 1st 4 weeks of 2018, a rapid increase in the number of confirmed human cases of yellow fever was observed in the states of Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, and Minas Gerais. From [1 Jul 2017] through [16 Feb 2018], 464 confirmed human cases of yellow fever have been reported in Brazil, including 154 deaths. Confirmed cases were reported in São Paulo (181 cases, including 53 deaths), Minas Gerais (225 cases, including 76 deaths), and Rio de Janeiro (57 cases, including 24 deaths) states and in the Federal District (1 fatal case). Unlike the previous seasonal period, the current seasonal period has been characterized by more cases reported in São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro states along with the occurrence of cases in areas near large cities.

In São Paulo State, 57 per cent of the confirmed cases were likely to have been infected in Mairiporã Municipality (a rural area located 15 km [9 mi] north of São Paulo Municipality). In Rio de Janeiro State, 45 per cent of the confirmed cases were among residents of Valença and Teresópolis municipalities; the latter is located 96 km [60 mi] from Rio de Janeiro City. Likely places where infections occurred for all of the confirmed cases correspond to areas with documented epizootics in non-human primates. In Minas Gerais, 47 per cent of the confirmed cases reside in municipalities located south and south east of the city of Belo Horizonte, where no human cases were detected during the outbreak in the 2016/2017 seasonal period.

Among unvaccinated travellers who stayed in Brazil, 2 laboratory-confirmed cases of yellow fever (in France and in the Netherlands) have been reported, in municipalities considered at risk for yellow fever as described in the international travel health recommendations on the basis of the virus circulation, the distribution of yellow fever vectors and animal reservoirs. In addition, 2 laboratory-confirmed cases were reported in Argentinean citizens, likely to have been infected in Ilha Grande, municipality of Angra do Reis, state of Rio de Janeiro, and Isla Bella, state of São Paulo Brazil (both municipalities are known to be at risk for yellow fever). Furthermore, as of [26 Feb 2018], 3 confirmed cases of yellow fever (2 fatal) have been reported in Chilean citizens likely to also have been infected in Ilha Grande, municipality of Angra do Reis, Rio de Janeiro state, Brazil.

Epizootics have been reported continuously along the yellow fever pre-season and seasonal period, indicating sustained virus circulation in favourable ecosystem, which is expanding to areas previously not considered at risk for yellow fever. From [1 Jul 2017] through [6 Feb 2018], 3812 epizootics among non-human primates have been reported of which 517 have been laboratory-confirmed, 1157 remain under investigation, 1397 were classified as indeterminate, and 741 were ruled out. Epizootics have been reported in 22 of the 27 federal areas in the country. Epizootics with confirmed yellow fever circulation among non-human primates were reported in 6 states (Espírito Santo, Mato Grosso, Minas Gerais, Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, and Tocantins). São Paulo has accounted for 42 percent of the total epizootics.

In addition, the Brazil Ministry of Health reported the detection of yellow fever virus in _Aedes albopictus_ mosquitoes captured in rural areas of 2 municipalities (Ituêta and Alvarenga) in Minas Gerais State in 2017 as part of an investigation conducted by the Ministry of Health of Brazil and the Evandro Chagas Institute. The significance of this finding requires further investigation, particularly to confirm vector competence to transmit yellow fever.

Public health response
----------------------
Since September 2017, when human cases of yellow fever and epizootics in non-human primates were confirmed in São Paulo State, national authorities have been intensifying vaccination activities through door-to-door vaccination and mass campaigns. In addition, state and municipality health authorities have been strengthening healthcare services for case management and carrying out risk communication activities.

On [25 Jan 2018], Brazilian health authorities began a vaccination campaign (fractional and standard doses) targeting 69 municipalities within Rio de Janeiro (10 million persons in 15 municipalities) and São Paulo (10.3 million in 54 municipalities) states.

As of [16 Feb 2018], preliminary results of the mass yellow fever vaccination campaign indicate that 4.3 million persons have been vaccinated for yellow fever (3.9 million persons with fractional doses and 379 900 persons with standard doses). This figure represents 21 per cent of the planned over 20 million persons targeted for vaccination within the two states. Due to the low vaccination rate achieved during the campaign in Rio de Janeiro State (12.1 per cent of the targeted population), state health authorities will extend the campaign. Similarly, in São Paulo State, only 29.6 per cent of the targeted population has been vaccinated during the campaign and state health authorities are assessing the need to extend the campaign for several additional days. In Bahia, the vaccination campaign began on [19 Feb 2018] with a targeted population of 3.3 million persons in eight municipalities.

WHO risk assessment
-------------------
The rapid increase in human cases and epizootics during recent weeks is concerning due to the persistence of virus circulation in at-risk areas and the spread to new areas, particularly near urban areas of large cities, such as São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, and in municipalities that were previously not considered at risk for yellow fever.

To date, yellow fever transmission by _Aedes aegypti_ has not been documented in Brazil. In entomological studies conducted during the 2016/2017 outbreak in some of the affected states, isolated haemagogus mosquitoes were found to be positive for yellow fever indicating predominantly sylvatic transmission. More recently, an investigation conducted by the Evandro Chagas Institute reported by the Brazil Ministry of Health revealed the detection of yellow fever virus in _Aedes albopictus_ mosquitoes captured in rural areas of 2 municipalities in Minas Gerais (Ituêta and Alvarenga) in 2017. The significance of this finding requires further investigation.

The preliminary results of the mass vaccination campaign in São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro states indicate low vaccination coverage which suggests a significant number of persons remain at risk and the necessity to intensify vaccination activities and risk communications among high-risk groups and hard-to-reach groups. The occurrence of 2 (possibly 3) confirmed cases among unvaccinated travellers indicates the need for State Parties to reinforce the dissemination of recommendations for international travellers.

WHO advice
----------
Yellow fever virus is transmitted to monkeys by forest dwelling mosquitoes such as haemagogus and sabethes. Humans who are exposed to these mosquitoes can become infected if they are not vaccinated.

Vaccination is the single most important measure for preventing yellow fever. The vaccine has been used for many decades and is safe and affordable, providing effective immunity against yellow fever within 10 days for more than 90 per cent of people vaccinated and within 30 days for 99 per cent of people vaccinated. A single dose provides lifelong protection.

In the current outbreak in Brazil, all human cases of yellow fever have been linked to haemagogus and sabethes mosquitoes. Basic precautions should be taken by people within and travelling to areas at risk for yellow fever. These include use of repellents, wearing long sleeves and trousers, and ensuring rooms are fitted with screens to prevent mosquitoes from entering.

Travellers returning with viraemia may pose a risk for the establishment of local yellow fever transmission cycles predominantly in areas where the conditions for yellow fever transmission are present (including ecological factors and presence of the competent vector). WHO has updated its recommendations for international travellers on [16 Jan 2018].

Urban transmission of yellow fever virus occurs when the virus is spread from human to human by the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes. The last documented outbreak of urban yellow fever in Brazil was recorded in 1942.

WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and review the risk assessment based on the latest available information.

[The above report provides a good update on the yellow fever (YF) situation in Brazil. There is no indication that the outbreak has ended. Should it extend for another 6 months, there is concern about infected travelers initiating ongoing transmission in countries where _Aedes aegypti_ populations are abundant and the local human population is unvaccinated and not immune. Brazil is counting on use of fractionated doses of yellow fever vaccine to extend its availability for coverage of a large number of people in 3 states. There have been questions about the duration of immunity in the field following administration of fractionated doses. Experimentally, studies have shown antibody persistence for at least 12 months to 6-8 years. A recent report of a study assessed the immune response to the fractional dose in a large-scale vaccination campaign in Kinshasa, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in the face of a YF outbreak in 2016. Neutralizing antibody titers against YF virus were determined in blood samples obtained before vaccination and 28 to 35 days after vaccination. Among 716 participants who completed follow-up, 705 (98 per cent) were seropositive after vaccination. Among 493 participants who were seronegative at baseline, 482 (98 per cent) underwent seroconversion. Among 223 participants who were seropositive at baseline, 148 (66 per cent) had an immune response. Lower baseline titers were associated with a higher probability of having an immune response. The conclusion is that a fractional dose of the 17DD YF vaccine was effective at inducing seroconversion in most of the participants who were seronegative at baseline and support the use of fractional-dose vaccination for outbreak control (http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1710430). These findings support the use of fractionated doses of the YF vaccine in Brazil.

Romania
Simin-Aysel Florescu and Corneliu Popescu from the Bucharest (BUC) GeoSentinel site in Romania have reported a case of yellow fever in a Romanian tourist who visited Ilha Grande in Brazil. This was a male traveler who was in South America (Brazil and Argentina) between [11 and 23 Feb 2018] including several days in Rio [11 to 15 Feb 2018]) and then a visit to Ilha Grande on [15 to 18 Feb 2018] where he had a lot of mosquito bites. This patient became symptomatic on [20 Feb 2018]. When he returned to Bucharest on [23 Feb 2018] he was hospitalized with liver and renal failure, rash, myalgia, and fever. This traveler did not receive yellow fever vaccination prior to visiting Brazil. This case of yellow fever has now been serologically confirmed; YF IgM was positive on day 8 of illness, and the IgG titer has been rising between days 4 and 8. PCR was negative, possibly due to high levels of ALT. The sample will be retested with PCR after dilution. The patient is maintaining consciousness and liver function and renal function are gradually improving.

Switzerland
We have learned of another confirmed case of yellow fever. The most recent one is a sad story. It was a 44 year old Swiss man who traveled to Brazil in February [2018] including a visit to Ilha Grande. He presented to the Zurich GeoSentinel site on [22 Feb 2018] in a critical condition. Yellow fever was confirmed by PCR. Sadly, he died today in the intensive care unit. He had a pre-travel visit but refused the yellow fever vaccine. This patient was reported by Patricia Schlagenhauf, site director for the Zurich GeoSentinel site.

These represent additional cases of yellow fever reported to the GeoSentinel surveillance network, presumably acquired in Ilha Grande, Brazil. These cases highlight the utility of travelers as sentinels.

Travelers planning to visit areas at risk for yellow fever in Brazil should receive yellow fever vaccine at least 10 days prior to traveling and follow measures to avoid mosquito bites. Clinicians seeing returning travelers should be aware of yellow fever symptoms and signs and be alert to possible YF exposure of their patients in Brazil including Ilha Grande.

[As noted when the cases occurred in the Netherlands and France, these cases and the 2 above illustrate why yellow fever is so dangerous due to viremic individuals who travel internationally to distant destinations. The infected individuals who traveled to these European destinations did not pose a risk for starting ongoing transmission because _Aedes aegypti_ vector mosquitoes are not present there, and other mosquitoes were not active during the winter. Should viremic individuals travel to locations where the vector mosquitoes are abundant and local individuals are susceptible, the outcome could be quite different. Local and international health authorities state that individuals planning to travel to the areas of yellow fever risk should receive the vaccine at least 10 days prior to travel.

Drs Hamer and Schlagenhauf are thanked for sending in these reports to ProMED-mail. - Mod.TY
