A 35-year-old Torrance-County man died after contracting the [a]
hantavirus, the New Mexico Department of Health announced Monday [23
May 2011]. The man was the 2nd New Mexico resident to die from [a]
hantavirus [infection] this year. A 51-year-old woman from McKinley
County died in January [2011 -- see ProMED-mail archive no. 20110124.0289].

Humans can contract hantavirus[es] when they breath rodent urine,
droppings or saliva particles. It is a potentially deadly respiratory
virus.

"The best defense against being infected with hantavirus[es] is to
avoid disturbing areas of rodent infestation, including nests and
droppings," Dr. Paul Ettestad, the department's state public health
veterinarian, said in a release. "As warmer weather occurs, people
should air out their cabins and sheds before entering them for the 1st
time."

The disease cannot spread from human to human [except for Andes virus
in South America. - Mod.TY]

In 2010 there were 2 nonfatal cases of hantavirus [infections] in
McKinley County, there were 4 nonfatal cases in New Mexico in 2009,
and there were 2 fatal cases in 2008. Since 1975, there have been 86
cases of hantavirus [infections] in New Mexico, which was more than
any other state. Of those cases, 8 were in San Juan County and 35 were
in McKinley county, according to the department of health.
