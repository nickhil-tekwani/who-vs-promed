Farmers have been found to be pumping a potentially lethal growth drug into
pigs in the latest food scare. Tests carried out after nine people fell sick
when they ate pig's lung soup found clenbuterol in stocks of pig offal.
Traders yesterday voluntarily suspended offal sales after health officials
warned people not to eat pig organs.
The Department of Health said it had found traces of the drug, also used to
fight asthma, in eight out of 14 samples of pigs' lungs. Farmers have been
known to use the drug in livestock feed to promote leaner meat - and higher
prices.
The department conducted the check after nine people developed symptoms
associated with the drug, including nausea, palpitations, dizziness and
headaches. Deputy director of health Dr Lam Ping-yan said those who fell ill
were part of a group of 11 who ate pig's lung soup last month. They
recovered within days. Doctors had been unable to confirm the symptoms were
brought on by the drug as it can be broken down by the body within 24 hours.
There was no residual effect . . . but these eight people who fell ill had
eaten pig's lung soup," Dr Lam said.
The concentration of the drug in the samples ranged between one microgram
per kilogram to 24 micrograms per kilogram, he said. "Documented clinical
experience shows that it requires concentrations of over 100 micrograms per
kilogram to cause food poisoning - nonetheless, the levels detected are not
acceptable." Pork was safe to eat and only pig's offal should be avoided, Dr
Lam added. Regional and urban services departments were visiting all meat
traders and restaurants asking them to withdraw pig's offal.
There is no record of any deaths due to consumption of meat tainted with the
drug, but experts said the possibility could not be ruled out.
Clenbuterol expands the small air passages in the lungs and lets air flow
more freely for asthmatics and those with other respiratory problems. "It
changes the heartbeat and affects people with hypertension," said Scarlett
Pong Oi-lan of the Association of Practising Pharmacists. "If the dosage is
high and people have these problems already, it could be fatal."
The tainted offal was thought to have been imported from the mainland where
it is outlawed. Acting Assistant Director of Agriculture and Fisheries Dr
Les Sims said: "Mainland officials are now conducting investigations and
have assured us that any farms found to be using such substances will be
stopped from exporting their pigs." Major pork importer Ng Fung Hong said
mainland farmers found to be using the drug would have their quotas
cancelled.
Hong Kong consumes 4,000 to 5,000 pigs a day.
