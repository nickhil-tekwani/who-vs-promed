The health ministry has warned that _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitos -- often referred to as the yellow fever mosquito -- have been identified in Cyprus, mainly in the area of Dromolaxia, near Larnaca.

The insect is known to spread yellow fever viruses, dengue fever, and Zika fever, among others.

The ministry on Thursday [29 Sep 2022] urged members of the public to be vigilant and do their utmost to reduce unnecessary points of exposed water collection which may serve as breeding grounds for the mosquito.

It detailed that a small number of the mosquitos were uncovered following a bicommunal technical health committee project. That prompted a coordinated effort to be launched by the health services, local authorities and other relevant officials to eliminate the mosquito population.

The health services explained that, should further concerns arise, they will carry out door-to-door information campaigns between 10 to 23 Oct 2022 If necessary, they will then proceed with extermination campaigns.

Expert entomologists have previously stated that Cyprus' location in the Mediterranean means it is sentinel for invasive mosquitos moving towards mainland Europe.

Other nations, such as the US, sometimes use genetically modified _Ae. aegypti_ mosquitos to control other mosquitoes in a community.

According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), "in the United States, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has authorised use of OX5034 GM _Ae. aegypti_ mosquitoes for release in counties in Florida and Texas."

"This EPA authorization allows local mosquito control programs to evaluate how effective GM mosquitoes are in reducing _Ae. aegypti_ mosquitoes in areas where they have been released."

[_Aedes aegypti_ has not become established in the Mediterranean basin. It is established on the eastern shore of the Black Sea, to the north of Cyprus in the Mediterranean. It is not clear how many individual mosquitoes have been found nor if this mosquito was found in several localities or just one. There is no information indicating how this mosquito came to Cyprus. A vigorous effort to find and eliminate this mosquito as soon as possible may prevent it from becoming established in Cyprus.

A map showing the distribution of _Aedes aegypti_ as of March 2022 can be seen at https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/aedes-aegypti-current-known-distribution-march-2022
