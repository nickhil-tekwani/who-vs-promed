A woman from Arizona predicted that she would be diagnosed with flu, but it turned out to be an infection that is caused by a rare rodent-carried virus that called a hantavirus. The woman, who is 27 years old, started getting sick in January [2018]. All the symptoms that came, nausea, stomach pain, led her to connected it with flu.

After meeting the doctor she went back to home. Later on, she started feeling shortness of breath. The woman's mother said, "she didn't test positive for pneumonia, the flu, hepatitis nothing she tested for was coming back positive." Later she asked to get the hantavirus test done by the doctors, which was found to be positive.

[The final status of the woman's condition is not stated, nor is there any information about the diagnostic test used for hantavirus infection nor is the location where the infection was acquired in Arizona mentioned. The mention of shortness of breath suggests that the infection had progressed to hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome, but apparently the woman did not die. Sporadic cases of hantavirus infections occur annually across the western USA including occasionally in Arizona. Interestingly, this year [2018] 17 mice trapped in San Diego county in neighboring California were positive for a hantavirus, but there have been no associated human cases there this year [2018] http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/health/sd-no-hanta-positives-20180227-story.html. An individual infected with a hantavirus became ill in Coconino county, Arizona last year [2017], but may have acquired the infection elsewhere. The hantavirus involved in this current case, above, and other cases in the western USA, is Sin Nombre virus. Fatalities are due to hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HPS). HPS can be very serious, and patients developing the symptoms should seek medical attention at the earliest possible time. As the above report notes, there is no information about the circumstances nor the location under which this infection was acquired.

Infected rodents shed the virus in feces, urine and saliva. Individuals opening up cabins or storage areas that have been closed over winter or cleaning areas with signs of rodent presence should heed the precautions that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends in order to avoid exposure to the virus (https://www.cdc.gov/rodents/cleaning/index.html).

Deer mice, _Peromyscus maniculatus_, are the reservoir hosts of the virus. An image of the deer mouse, _P. maniculatus_, can be seen at http://www.nsf.gov/news/mmg/media/images/mouse_f.jpg and in the report at the above URL. - Mod.TY

This [Tue 27 Feb 2018], 3 patients with hantavirus [infections] from the district in Las Tablas were confirmed with the disease in Los Santos province.

Carlos Muñoz, coordinator in the Los Santos Department of Epidemiology stated that last week [week of Sun 18 Feb 2018] a 56 year old patient from Capo Alegre village in the Manantial neighborhood of the Las Tablas district was admitted [to hospital].

Last night [Mon 26 Feb 2018] 2 more cases arrived, a 33 year old patient from Loma Bonita, La Laja in Las Tablas and a 33 year old man from Las Palmitas in Las Tablas The latter was admitted with vomiting and diarrhea signs and the test was positive [for a hantavirus infection].

Muñoz indicated that to date, 11 cases have been registered, of these, 6 patients are hospitalized, and 2 in a room who have overcome the need for mechanical ventilation. Out of 4 patients in intensive care, 2 are in the Joaquin Pablo Franco Hospital and 2 in the Anita Moreno [Hospital] La Villa in Los Santos.

Health [officials] stated that almost all these patients have the characteristic of having contacts with agricultural activities, with transfer of bales, with crops, and cleaning houses that have been closed, among others.

The population of rodents has increased since November [2017], it is being monitored in Agua Buena in Tonosi and specialists from Gorgas [Memorial Institute] carry out studies and trapping of the rodents that transmit hantaviruses.

[Hantavirus infections occur in Los Santos province relatively frequently. There have been 11 cases so far this year [2018] and last year [2017] ended with 23 cases, 16 with [hantavirus] fever and 7 with hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome. The specific situations in which the patients acquired their infections are not mentioned although the 6 patients above had agricultural or rural activities. There is no indication of which hantavirus is involved in this or in previous cases in Panama. As noted in comments in previous posts, Los Santos and adjoining provinces are endemic for Choclo hantavirus. Although no data on this or the previous cases in earlier years include an indication of which hantavirus is responsible, Choclo is the only one of the 3 hantaviruses known to be endemic in Panama that causes HPS (hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome) or hantavirus fever. No vaccine is available for Choclo virus.

The rodent host of Choclo virus is the pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys fulvescens_), a photograph of which can be accessed at http://www.medwave.cl/medios/perspectivas/Hantavirus/Actualiz/Fig2.jpg. These rodents occur in and around agricultural areas and adjacent houses and buildings. They can be persistently infected with the virus and shed it in urine, feces, and saliva.
