Lassa fever has come to town
----------------------------
FREETOWN (Concord Times, 4 Jul 2000): Disease Control Manager, Dr. Haroun
Turay has confirmed that Lassa fever has claimed at least four lives. As
its name implies, Lassa is a disease that manifests itself through fever
and before you know it, bleeding sets in. A Lassa fever victim bleeds from
all openings of his or her body - the nose, ears, the anus and so on. The
incubation period of Lassa fever is between 3 to 21 days. The outbreak of
Lassa fever in [Freetown is a worrying development when you consider how
the disease is transmitted. Luckily perhaps, Dr. Turay says those rats
which bite people when they [the people are asleep and pass on the virus
through their [the rats' urine have not been seen in [Freetown. So we
[may be observing human-to-human transmission through body fluids. In
recent times, Lassa has killed 4 people of the same family; a doctor and 3
members of his family. [It is likely that there are more unreported deaths
in [Freetown: The Storm Newspaper of 1 Jul 2000 reported that 2 people had
died at the Approved School Camp and who knows where else. In most homes in
this very over-crowded city, the rat population far outnumbers the human
population, and rats are responsible for the spread of this disease.
However, in a family setting human-to-human transmission is a possibility.
Lassa fever is manifested [initially by fever, and fever is part of the
lives of Freetown residents. Self-medication for fever is a common
practice. A few chloroquine tablets plus paracetamol, or any anti-malarial
drug, is what most people take to get back online when they get fever. With
Lassa here with us, people should be more careful when diagnosing
themselves. Over the weekend, the Director General of Medical Services, Dr.
Sheku Tejan Kamara, expressed concern about the outbreak of Lassa fever in
[Freetown. Lassa fever is a disease that is localized in the Eastern part
of the country; i.e. Kenema, Segbwema, Panguma, Tongo and so on. Dr. Turay
says that measures are being taken to control the disease by effective
surveillance.
Lassa fever is another rebel that has invaded the city bringing into sharp
focus the little attention that the disease had probably received when it
was in the East. My wife asked me a "difficult" question the other day "Is
Lassa fever a new disease?" [My answer was that the presence of Lassa
fever is an indication of the "so-called" provincial marginalisation, [and
deficiencies in public health. Health Education talks on radio,
television, in mosques and churches should be given without delay. Also,
special attention should be given to those who have had contacts with Lassa
patients. [Rodent control measures should be stepped up. - Mod. CP.
Lastly, if you have fever today, don't just take few chloroquine tablets,
contact a doctor or visit a health centre.

Campaign Against Lassa Fever Gathers Momentum
---------------------------------------------
FREETOWN: (Concord Times, 5 Jul 2000) - Health Education boss Mr. Valentine
has said that a campaign against Lass fever has started in Freetown.
Describing the outbreak as "very serious and a concern," Mr. Kawa said that
so far 4 people have died from the disease, which is occurring in Freetown
for the very first time. The 4 include a physician who died on 30 Jun 2000
and was buried without ceremonies and 3 other family members. A seminar on
Lassa Fever which was scheduled to take place early this week has been
postponed till further notice. The Health Education boss said that people
should improve their daily personal hygiene, report very high fever at
once, kill all rats by probably introducing a cat in the house and should
cover all foods and water.
"Tracing of close contacts with the deceased, Dr. Kabbah and his relatives
is also continuing and community Health Education has started on radio and
television," Mr. Kawa said.

[The gist of these 2 reports is that there have been "at least" 4 deaths in
Freetown, Sierra Leone, attributed to Lassa Fever. There may have been more
deaths. Two cases were reported in a July 1 news report in addition to the
4 cases reported here. It is not clear whether the diagnosis of Lassa fever
has been confirmed - Mod. CP
