[NOTE - This is a follow-up report indicating the alternative confirmed diagnosis for Anthrax - Australia (03): (QL) cattle, NOT 20190215.6319254.]

Queensland Chief Veterinary Officer, Dr. Allison Crook, is urging livestock owners to be cautious when sourcing fodder supplies after the deaths of 14 cattle on a property in the Stanthorpe district.

As drought conditions persist in much of southern Queensland and large areas of New South Wales and Victoria, hay is increasingly being made from failed grain crops and drought affected forage crops.

In hot, dry conditions, crops normally providing a valuable source of feed can accumulate high levels of prussic acid [hydrogen cyanide] and nitrates. Even after being cut and made into hay, the levels of these 2 naturally occurring chemicals can still be high and toxic to stock, as was the case in this recent Stanthorpe incident.

Always ask your vendor whether they have tested hay, and always use a commodity vendor declaration.

[Plants in the genus _Sorghum_ may accumulate prussic acid. Prussic acid, hydrocyanic acid and hydrogen cyanide are all terms relating to cyanide poisoning. The _Sorghum_ spp. of plants and other common plants may accumulate large quantities of cyanogenic glycosides, (a sugar compound with cyanide attached), which are located in the outer tissue or epidermal layer of the plant.

An enzyme resides in the inner or mesophyll leaf tissues. When an event stresses the plant, such as frost, drought, drought followed by rain and a sudden burst of growth, or trauma to the plant, the mesophyll portion of the plant or leaf releases the enzyme, which breaks down the cyanogenic glycosides releasing the cyanide compound and the sugar. The sugar makes the plant tasty and cyanide makes the plant deadly.

Sadly, this is not an uncommon event. Forages high in prussic acid may be used for hay if they are given adequate drying or curing time. The amount of time needed depends upon the level of the prussic acid in the environment as well as the ambient temperatures and humidity.

If the field is cured and baled, the regrowth of the plants may also be toxic for the reasons mentioned previously.

Times of drought, just after a frost, rapid growth after a rain, or regrowth of the plant following cutting are all times to be cautious with prussic acid-accumulating plants.

Some prussic acid-accumulating plants can also accumulate nitrates.

Plants absorb nitrate which is normally converted to nitrite by the nitrate reductase system and incorporated into amino acids and proteins. Genetic or environmental factors interfering with or inhibiting the function of the nitrate reductase system allow for nitrate to accumulate in the plant. For example, in response to stressful conditions, sorghum species have reduced reductase activity. Drought and conditions of reduced sunlight will also decrease the activity of the nitrate reductase system.

Despite the decreased activity, nitrate is continuously absorbed by the plant and accumulates to abnormally high levels. Ruminants consuming these plants convert the nitrate to nitrite and then to ammonia. Nitrate toxicity is a function of the amount and rate at which nitrate is consumed. When the animal consumes a normal forage diet containing large amounts of nitrate, the conversion of nitrite to ammonia becomes the limiting factor allowing nitrite to accumulate to toxic levels. Toxicity occurs following the absorption of nitrite into the blood which oxidizes iron in hemoglobin from the ferrous (+2) to ferric (+3) state. The resultant methemoglobin has a very poor affinity for oxygen which greatly reduces the oxygen-carrying capacity of red blood cells. Death from anoxia may occur if 70-80 percent of the hemoglobin is converted to methemoglobin https://www.addl.purdue.edu/newsletters/2002/fall/nitrate.shtml.

The tests for these 2 toxins are very different as is the method and timing regarding the collection of the plants. It is appropriate to check with your diagnostic laboratory. Prussic acid, with enough time, can drop to a safe level, but once nitrate/nitrites are high in the plant, cutting the plant for hay means those levels will not decrease. The plant must grow its way out of high nitrate/nitrite levels. Test your forages for both prussic acid and nitrate/nitrites.

Plant poisonings of livestock from these toxins are much more common than most people realize. Most of time, it does not make a news source, so many people may not realize how common this situation is. - Mod.TG
