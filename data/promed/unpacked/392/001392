Your posting about mycolactone as a toxin and virulence factor for _M.
ulcerans_ as the agent of Buruli ulcer [Tue 27 Jul 1999 included a broad
statement that suggested that "This toxin may represent one of a family of
virulence factors associated with pathology in mycobacterial diseases such
as leprosy and tuberculosis."
I can think of no intracellular bacterial pathogen LESS toxic than _M.
leprae_. In lepromatous disease billions of organisms thrive in local
tissue for years and, considering their massive numbers, do relatively
little damage. In vitro cultured mononuclear phagocytes from a variety of
species can be infected with _M. leprae_ until they are gorged with hundreds
of bacilli each, with interesting effects on the afferent and efferent
effector function(s) of these cells but with little, if any, sign of
"toxicity."
