The following comment may be useful in relation to the ProMED-mail
post entitled: Rabies - Indonesia (19): Bali, human 20111221.3647.

It is so distressing to read about these continuing rabies deaths in
Bali, particularly in cases like this one, with incubation periods of
several months, which are quite typical for human rabies, spanning
months rather than weeks from exposure to disease (e.g. see Fishbein
DB: Rabies in humans. In Baer GM (ed): The Natural History of Rabies,
ed 2. Boca Raton, Fla, CRC Press, 1991, pp 519-549. 34).

It is well established that rabies post exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is
effective before the appearance of clinical symptoms of rabies,
"regardless of the time interval between exposure and initiation,"
(Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, MMWR, 2010). This fact
should be brought to public awareness beyond the fact that
post-exposure vaccinations should be initiated as soon as possible:
"It is never too late!"
