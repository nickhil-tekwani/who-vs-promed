A rare and fatal virus that infected Maine salmon being held at a
Massachusetts hatchery to produce eggs remains a puzzle. The virus,
detected only once before at an aquaculture farm in Scotland in the
late 1970s, killed or infected scores of salmon taken from the
Pleasant River in Washington County. Scientists say they don't know
where the virus came from or what caused the outbreak. The virus
cannot be transmitted to humans, but it usually kills infected fish,
said John Coll, a fish health expert with the Fish and Wildlife
Service in Pennsylvania.
The episode has heightened the federal government's concerns about
the use of European strains of salmon in the fish farms that dot the
Down East coast, near the wild salmon rivers. The National Marine
Fisheries Service believes that hybrid fish produced by fish farmers
may introduce diseases or damage the genetic integrity of wild
salmon, making them less likely to survive. The agency wants to
strike an agreement with industry and the state on the use of
foreign strains of fish by March, when the fisheries service will
conduct its first annual review of Maine's wild salmon conservation
plan.
But a spokesman for the aquaculture industry said there is no
scientific evidence that foreign strains of fish are damaging the
wild salmon population. Joseph McGonigle, executive director of the
Maine Aquaculture Association, said Friday the agency's position
threatens the survival of the state's $55 million aquaculture
industry.
The Pleasant River, which drains into the ocean about 40 miles east
of Addison, is one of seven rivers where the state is trying to
restore wild salmon populations.
Local strains of salmon were so depleted when fish farming began in
Maine more than a decade ago that the industry was forced to use
foreign strains to avoid genetic inbreeding, McGonigle said. Outside
strains also produce fish that grow faster and resist disease better.
Biologists began catching young salmon in the Pleasant River in 1996
to develop broodstock -- mature fish whose eggs would be raised in
tanks until they hatched. The hatchery fish would [normally be
returned to the river at a young age to supplement the wild salmon
population. But while the broodstock fish were being held at a U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service hatchery in North Attleboro, Mass., they
developed a rare virus that killed or infected most of the fish. It
took fisheries experts nearly two years of investigation to identify
the problem, which had never been seen at a U.S. hatchery.
Biologists will have to start again with the Pleasant River stocking
program, using new fish that will have to be tested to make sure they
don't have the virus.

[late 1970s> does not fit the description of infectious salmon anemia.
Would one of our informed fisheries research members attempt to
identify this "late 1970s" virus? Yet again, it seems that whoever
briefed AP forgot to make the name of this virus clear to the
journalist - Mod.MHJ
