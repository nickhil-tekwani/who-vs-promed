In various reports on West Nile virus I have read the recommendation to use
repellents and to wear adequate clothing "from dusk till dawn", known to be
effective when _Anopheles_ spp. are involved. But as far as I know, _Culex_
mosquitoes (and _Aedes_ spp. as well) are also active during daytime, so
the recommendation of wearing adequate clothing "after sunset" should be
discussed (or even corrected).

[An experienced medical entomologist informs ProMED-mail that he does not
know of any scientific study that shows effective reduction of disease risk
by taking such precautions. As for day biting, he says that many _Aedes_
species bite during the day, such as forest _Aedes_ that bite in heavy
shade. Many other species will bite in the afternoon at low light levels. -
