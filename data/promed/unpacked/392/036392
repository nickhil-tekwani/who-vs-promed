CDC lifts recommendation for malaria prophylaxis in resort areas
----------------------------------------------------------------
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has lifted the
outbreak notice for travel to La Altagracia Province, Dominican Republic,
including the resorts at Punta Cana. No new malaria cases in travelers have
been reported from the area since January 2005; the numbers of malaria
cases in the Dominican Republic have returned to what is normal for this
province. The outbreak notice for Duarte Province was lifted on 23 Feb 2005.
20 cases of malaria were reported in people who had traveled to resort
areas in La Altagracia Province from 3 Nov 2004 to 10 Jan 2005, and a
single case in a traveler to Duarte Province who returned in early November
2004. 5 of the travelers were from the US, 6 from Canada, and 10 from
Europe. (These resort areas had previously been malaria-free).
In response to the outbreak, CDC recommended taking an antimalarial drug to
all travelers to the 2 provinces, including resort areas. The Ministry of
Health of the Dominican Republic increased surveillance for possible cases,
increased mosquito spraying and elimination of breeding sites, and ensured
that any malaria cases found were promptly treated. The Pan American Health
Organization and CDC provided assistance and advice to the Ministry.
Since malaria continues to be a risk in rural areas of the Dominican
Republic (but not in cities or resort areas), travelers to these rural
areas should take an antimalarial drug. Chloroquine is the recommended drug
for the Dominican Republic. Malaria can usually be prevented by taking an
antimalarial drug and by using antimosquito measures. Chloroquine has a
long history of use and safety and has been found to be well tolerated by
most people, including children. People with an allergy to chloroquine
should discuss an alternative antimalarial drug with their health care
provider.
Because antimalarial drugs are not 100 per cent protective, other measures
to prevent mosquito bites should also be used, such as insect repellents
that contain the ingredients DEET (N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide) or Picaridin
(KBR 3023).
Travelers who become ill with a fever or flu-like illness while traveling
in the Dominican Republic or after returning home (up to one year) should
immediately seek medical care. Tell your health care provider that you have
been in the Dominican Republic and that you may have been exposed to malaria.
