Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) has caused 10 deaths in Iran since the beginning of the current Iranian calendar year (21 Mar 2018), Fars reported on Wed 30 May 2018.

CCHF is a widespread disease caused by a tick-borne virus. The disease outbreak normally occurs in spring, and it becomes more severe with the beginning of the livestock breeding season.

In spite of receiving the best medical care, in general, 10 percent of the patients affected by the virus face death, Mohammad Nabavi, deputy director for the communicable diseases department of the Ministry of Health said.

Every year, a number of people die of the fever, Nabavi said, adding that some 10 percent of the people who are diagnosed with Crimean-Congo fever and receive proper medical care may die, while this number increases to 50 percent for the people who do not get any treatment.

Annually, some 100 to 150 cases of Crimean-Congo fever are reported in Iran.

According to that report, 10 confirmed CCHF cases with one death have been reported so far in 2018. A clarification in this regard from the concerned persons will be highly appreciated. - Mod.UBA
