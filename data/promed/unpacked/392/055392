Disinfection begun at Guadalajara farm with bird flu outbreak
-------------------------------------------------------------
The Agricultural delegate in Guadalajara, Sergio Cabellos, today [21
Oct 2009] announced the commencement of disinfection and cleaning of
the Almoguera poultry farm [in Guadalajara, Castile-La Mancha] where
a variant of avian flu was identified a fortnight ago, leading to the
culling of more than 320 000 chickens.

Speaking to reporters, Cabellos has also reported that they have
returned to the affected area and performed analyses that
demonstrated "there have been no new cases" identified within a
radius of 10 kilometers [6 mi].

In this regard, he said that at this time reports are favorable, but
even so, the government of Castile-La Mancha will continue with the
present methodology in collaboration with the Ministry and the poultry sector.

The avian flu virus detected in this farm in Almoguera is only
transmitted between birds, it is the H7N7 type, which is rarely
transmitted to humans.

[In contrast to the statement in the article above, in 2003, H7N7 was
found in humans, having first began in chickens. The report is from
the CDC (<http://www.cdc.gov/flu/avian/h7n7-netherlands.htm>):

"As of 25 Apr 2003, the National Influenza Center in The Netherlands
reported that 83 confirmed cases of human H7N7 influenza virus
infections had occurred among poultry workers and their families
since the H7N7 outbreak began in chickens at the end of February
2003. The vast majority (79) of these people had conjunctivitis, and
6 of those with conjunctivitis also reported influenza-like illness
(ILI) symptoms (such as, fever, cough, muscle aches). One person had
ILI only (no conjunctivitis) and 2 persons had mild illness that
could not be classified as ILI or conjunctivitis. In addition, one
individual, a 57-year-old veterinarian who visited one of the
affected farms in early April [2003], died on 17 Apr 2003 of acute
respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and related complications from
H7N7 infection. Dutch authorities have reported evidence of possible
transmission of H7N7 influenza from 2 poultry workers to 3 family
members. All 3 family members had conjunctivitis and one also had ILI."

Given this report, one wonders if the officials in Spain are
investigating the poultry workers and how the poultry encountered
this virus. Have there been any increased reports of influenza in
humans in the area?

Castile-La Mancha is the region for the setting of the famous Spanish
novel _Don Quixote_ by Miguel de Cervantes. La Mancha, a windswept,
battered plateau in Spain embodies the symbols of the Spanish
culture, including sunflowers, olive oil and olive yards, mushrooms,
especially its windmills, and Manchego cheese, along with the novel
_Don Quixote_. - Mod.TG]
