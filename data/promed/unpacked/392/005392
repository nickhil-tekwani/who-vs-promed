Lewis County health officials have confirmed 4 cases of _E. coli_-related illnesses within the past month, quadrupling the county's recent annual case average. John Abplanalp, community services manager with Lewis County Health and Social Services, said the cases are not related and could be from a variety of causes. Abplanalp declined to disclose the intensity of the cases. The county had 4 _E. coli_ cases during 2012-2013.

Particularly bad strains can cause severe abdominal cramps, bloody diarrhea, and vomiting. Children ages 5 and younger and senior citizens are more likely to develop hemolytic uremic syndrome, a complication that leads to kidney failure. However, _E. coli_ bacteria are mostly harmless but can cause diarrhea.

"Generally, this infection will run its course on its own. Most people don't require treatment," Abplanalp said Mon 15 Sep 2014.

_E. coli_ has recently dominated national headlines after a 5-year-old Oregon girl died after eating a turkey sandwich at a restaurant. Her friend, 5, is getting treated at a Tacoma hospital for _E. coli_ complications. The children reportedly also had been swimming in a pond that day.

Abplanalp said causes for _E. coli_ illnesses are difficult to pin down unless a cluster of people is infected by the same source. In all cases, however, infections are caused by ingesting fecal bacteria. "It has to get into your mouth, either by your hands or getting contaminated food," Abplanalp said. "There are so many causes, especially Lewis County being rural. A lot of people are exposed to livestock. Ground and tenderized meat hold a greater risk, because the bacteria can get inside the meat."

[It is not clearly stated whether these other Washington State cases are enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ in etiology but the discussion regarding livestock and beef suggest that they are. ProMED would like more information about these cases. - Mod. LL

Health professionals are looking for a common cause of _E. coli_ that sent several Kentucky children to the hospital. The Lincoln Trail District Health Department confirmed the 5 cases. 3 of the children were from Hardin County, 1 was from Oldham County, and the last 1 was from Nelson County. An official say it's unusual to see a cluster of cases like this.

The Kentucky Standard reports, the 1st case was reported back in August 2014. The most recent was last Wed 10 Sep 2014. All 5 children are still in the hospital.

[As expected, the etiology of the hemolytic uremic cases in 3 counties in Kentucky is an enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_. The serotype of the strain (or strains) is not given and it is not known whether DNA fingerprinting has been done to assess how many of these 5 cases are related and, additionally, if they are related to the outbreak of cases in children in Oregon and Washington State which we also do not know if they are related. - Mod.LL
