Cases have recently surfaced in Guinea's west and southeast -- areas previously thought to be free of the Ebola virus disease (EVD). A 2nd spike in cases has panicked residents and health officials in Guinea, who fear the West African outbreak of the killer disease may now be out of control.

"EVD cases are worrying. We do not know what to expect," Mamady Traore, a trader in the suburbs of the capital Conakry, told AFP on Thursday, 19 Jun 2014. "Sometimes you are told it has been (contained) and sometimes you hear it has reappeared in other towns and villages."

According to figures released by the World Health Organization (WHO) on Wednesday, 18 Jun 2014, a total of 398 cases of hemorrhagic fever -- causing 264 deaths -- have been reported in Guinea since the start of 2014. Of these, 254 were caused by EVD.

The incurable disease [incorrect -- there are now many survivors - Mod.JW] is spread by contact with bodily fluids including sweat, meaning just touching an infected person is enough to spread the virus. "The government can't do anything to fight the disease," taxi driver Abdoulaye Barry said of the ebolavirus, one of the deadliest known viruses, which kills its victims by inducing unstoppable internal bleeding. The latest outbreak began in southeast Guinea and spread rapidly through neighboring Liberia and Sierra Leone. Cases have recently surfaced in Guinea's west and southeast -- areas previously thought to be free of the disease. "We're faced with a 2nd spike in the epidemic," Marie-Christine Ferir, a worker for aid agency Doctors Without Borders, told AFP. "What is unusual is the [wide] spreading of outbreak locations. It complicates things."

On Thursday [19 Jun 2014] in Conakry, there was no discernable presence of medical staff around key buildings. An AFP correspondent said, however, that sanitizing hand gels were offered to customers at the entrances of banks and insurance companies.

A total of 528 hemorrhagic fever cases have been reported throughout West Africa in 2014, inflicting 337 deaths. Almost 70 percent were caused by EVD, which can induce severe fever and muscle pain, as well as vomiting, diarrhea and organ failure.

Sierra Leone has stepped up measures to fight the highly contagious and deadly Ebola virus disease (EVD), the health minister has said. Miatta Kargbo said Thursday [19 Jun 2014] that the number of registered cases of haemorrhagic fever had risen to 246. Of these, 103 were confirmed to be EVD and 26 had died.

Kargbo told journalists that her figures showed that health workers "have access to places they had difficulty to access" in the past, including the remote Koindu and Kissi Teng chiefdoms in the eastern region. Checkpoints to screen potential Ebola cases were now in place and "functional", the minister added, declaring that the local population had proven increasingly cooperative about taking tests.

Like other haemorrhagic fevers, Ebola causes high fever, vomiting, muscle pain and diarrhoea and can lead to organ failure and unstoppable internal bleeding. It is spread by bodily fluids including sweat, which means that just touching an infected person can spread the virus. There is no [specific] cure and the current strain of Ebola has a [high] death rate, according to medical teams, but patients can be isolated and at least treated for symptoms [and a number do recover - Mod.JW].

Sierra Leonean authorities have also set up a further 13 checkpoints in the eastern towns of Kailahun, Kono and Kenema; 4 health workers stand at each checkpoint with equipment including safety gloves, chlorine, disposable thermometers and mobile phones. In some districts, local personnel are backed up by staff of the medical charity Doctors Without Borders, known by its French acronym MSF, which is also helping out in Guinea and Liberia [possibly not Liberia -- see [5] below - Mod.JW]. WHO is providing Sierra Leone with technical support in fighting the epidemic and recently trained ambulance drivers and medics in safely handling the sick and dead bodies.

[3] Sierra Leone: problems

Many people in Sierra Leone, where an ebolavirus epidemic has gripped the country for the 1st time, refuse to accept that the disease can be tackled by Western medicine. They prefer to use traditional healers instead. This may make it spread faster. At least 22 people have died so far; another 96 have been infected there.

The Sierra Leonean authorities are therefore up against both a health-care problem and a cultural one. Traditional healers and herbalists are popular across West Africa. With secret recipes of herbs and potions, they claim to cure everything from the common cold to malaria. We're only looking at the ears of the hippo," says Amara Jambai, Sierra Leone's director of disease prevention and control. "Many cases stay in the communities because people still like to use alternative sources of treatment. So we miss a lot of cases and only capture a few."

Plenty reckon that those who succumb to the disease are victims of a curse fired by a "witch gun"; Western medicine is thought to offer little defence against it. Only a witch doctor can have the curse removed -- for a fee. Official health workers sometimes face physical resistance from those they seek to help. Some have been denied access to the sick; others have been refused blood samples. In one incident, medical staff were stoned by villagers bent on removing ebolavirus patients from a health centre.

Given a health-care system lacking decent equipment, qualified staff and affordable drugs (rather than the more popular counterfeit ones), a lack of faith in Western medicine is understandable. The ministry of health has put out flyers with answers to questions such as "Is it true Ebola is a curse?" and "Can a mix of ginger, honey, garlic, onion and vinegar cure Ebola?" At the same time, the authorities have used mobile-phone networks to warn people by text to avoid eating the meat of [fruit] bats, one of the disease's prime carriers [and a popular food item - Mod.JW]. A band based in neighbouring Liberia, which also has the scourge, has released a catchy new song with lyrics such as "Ebola, Ebola in town/Don't touch your friend/No eating something/It's dangerous".

Comments and Opinions:
Ebola Update from American Expert
---------------------------------
The Ministry of Health and Sanitation has been giving us what they say are credible statistics. However, Tulane University's Ebola expert [Dr Robert Garry], sent to Sierra Leone from the United States Government, has returned to America, and just a day or so ago on 18 Jun 2014, he gave an interview there which was broadcast all over America's National Public Radio (NPR). His voice is still available for download from the NPR website [http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2014/06/18/323213138/doctors-aren-t-sure-how-to-stop-africa-s-deadliest-ebola-outbreak].

It is recalled that on 18 Jun 2014, health ministry statistics said Sierra Leone only had 22 EVD deaths nationwide so far. Well, on that same date, here is what the EVD expert told Americans by radio:

"There are many villages in the eastern part of Sierra Leone that are basically devastated," virologist Robert Garry of Tulane University tells NPR's Jason Beaubien. "We walked into one village and we found 25 corpses. One house with 7 people, all in one family, were dead. It's a very serious situation there." Garry had just returned to the USA from West Africa. "This is about as bad as an Ebola outbreak gets."

So, the Health Ministry says there are only 22 deaths nationwide, whilst America's expert says in one village alone, they saw 25 dead bodies. So, who is [right]?

[Excerpts]
----------
International organizations and the governments involved need to send in more health experts and to increase the public education messages about how to stop the spread of the disease, Bart Janssens, the director of operations for Doctors Without Borders [MSF] in Brussels told the Associated Press on Friday [20 Jun 2014]. The situation requires a more effective response, and with more than 40 international staff currently on the ground and 4 treatment centers, Doctors Without Borders has reached its limit to respond, he said. "It's the 1st time in an Ebola epidemic where (Doctors Without Borders) teams cannot cover all the needs, at least for treatment centers," he said.

It is unclear, for instance, if the group will be able to set up a treatment center in Liberia, like the ones it is running in in Guinea and Sierra Leone, he said. For one thing, Janssens said, the group doesn't have any more experienced people in its network to call on. As it is, some of its people have already done 3 tours on the ground.

Janssens said this outbreak is particularly challenging because it began in an area where people are very mobile and has spread to even more densely populated areas, like the capitals of Guinea and Liberia. The disease typically strikes sparsely populated areas in central or eastern Africa, where it spreads less easily, he said. By contrast, the epicenter of this outbreak is near a major regional transport hub, the Guinean city of Gueckedou.

He said the only way to stop the disease's spread is to persuade people to come forward when symptoms occur and to avoid touching the sick and dead. "There is still not a real change of behavior of the people," he said. "So a lot of sick people still remain in hiding or continue to travel. And there is still news that burial practices are remaining dangerous."

[I'm not convinced that more white-skinned experts can help with public communication in this area of Africa, where the common belief is that the outsiders bring the disease. After all, it is always worse in the places where they are working (the local people do not understand that of course the experts go to the areas where there are the most cases, to bring urgent aid). As a blogger has pointed out, if a bunch of outsiders with a different skin colour came to our community and told us our traditional beliefs in the causes of disease, the burial practices we have followed for generations, and one of our favourite foods were responsible for making the epidemic worse, we would take a lot of convincing. Even in developed countries, there are movements against vaccinations, which have saved many more lives than herbal remedies.

Looking at the map, it is remarkable that we don't have confirmed reports of EVD from across the borders of the affected region, in the contiguous forested areas of Senegal, Gambia, Mali, Guinea-Bissau or Cote d'Ivoire. (The forest belt can be clearly seen on Google Earth by searching for West Africa). But there is no surplus manpower or funds for outsiders to go looking there, and those African governments probably don't want to know if they have the ebolavirus for fear of the implications. However, Senegal and Gambia do have contingency plans in place -- see ProMED-mails archives (35) and (62) at the end of this post -- and there has been a call for action in Nigeria (ProMED-mail archive (49) below).

There is an up-to-date map of EVD's geographical spread at http://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2014/06/ebola-outbreak-spreads-as-toll-reaches-337-201461822534324796.html. - Mod.JW
