Infectious Disease News spoke with Erin Blau, DNP, MSN, a CDC Epidemic Intelligence Service officer assigned to the Kentucky Department of Public Health, about how inappropriate vaccine storage and handling procedures led to a recent outbreak of injection-site _Mycobacterium fortuitum_ infections in 3 states, affecting more than 100 people.

In December 2018, the Kentucky Department for Public Health received reports from a local public health department about 3 patients with abscesses at vaccine injection sites. The patients were vaccinated by a single provider that had administered several hundred vaccinations to workers and family members at 7 company work sites.

Blau said the outbreak, which occurred during influenza season and also included patients in Indiana and Ohio, is "an example of what might occur when someone isn't handling vaccines appropriately."

"I think it's really important to recognize that this is the exception and that this isn't something that happens routinely," Blau said.

During this investigation of a multi-state outbreak of non-tuberculous mycobacterium (NTM) infections, we identified numerous issues with vaccine handling and storage at one company, which ultimately led to over 100 injection-site infections among vaccine recipients in 3 states. During the investigation, additional evidence was found to support the Kentucky Department for Public Health making a public recommendation that anyone who received a vaccination from this company be revaccinated, which was estimated to affect more than 1000 people.

This investigation took place during flu season and during an on-going hepatitis A outbreak, which both needed widespread vaccination efforts. Not only were the reported NTM infections serious, requiring multiple medical treatments such as incision and drainage or surgeries, but it is also very likely that all of the vaccine administered by this company was ineffective and did not provide any protection to the recipients.

This investigation highlights the need for continued provider education and stricter requirements regarding who can administer vaccines. It also brings attention to the unique laws in each state that regulate vaccines and the administration of vaccines. Following the investigation, our primary focus is to propose and advocate for policies that support continued vaccine access AND increased vaccine safety.

(Note: This is a statewide health alert that updates a previous alert sent on 18 Dec 2018.)

The Kentucky Department for Public Health (KDPH) is updating you about a cluster of adverse vaccination reactions, including multiple local site infections with a _Mycobacterium_ species. There is no evidence to suggest that this is a vaccine safety or syringe manufacturer issue, as reactions continue to be limited to one vaccination provider. New infections are still being identified and can be difficult to treat, so we want to highlight the need for continued vigilance and appropriate evaluation, treatment, and revaccination.

Abscesses at the site of injection and inflammatory or fibrous nodules have been reported following the administration of hepatitis A, Tdap, pneumococcal, or seasonal influenza vaccinations. If you encounter this in your practice, we highly recommend a workup for nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM), along with other bacterial and fungal pathogens. The following cultures and stains are recommended and should be obtained from the lesions, abscesses, or surgical specimens: Anaerobic culture; Aerobic culture; Fungal culture; and AFB smear and culture.

Clinicians have also reported removing "nodules" or "knots" from the sites of infection where injections were previously administered. Any biologic material from tissue debridement or surgical excision should be sent for the same cultures listed above and should also be sent to pathology for analysis.

Antibiotic susceptibility testing on recovered organisms should be obtained in order to inform antibiotic therapy. A _Mycobacterium_ species has been identified from cultures from numerous patients.

Given that these organisms are not commonly encountered in primary care practice, it is recommended that affected patients be referred to an infectious disease specialist for consultation and potential ongoing management.

Given the identification of substantial issues with improper vaccine storage and handling, we have serious concerns that the vaccines administered by this provider may not have afforded protection to vaccine recipients. Consequently, revaccination is recommended as the prudent course of action.

Reactions (abscesses, fibroid knots) are associated with a single vaccination provider in a rural county who was providing vaccination clinics at Kentucky, Indiana, and Ohio businesses. Investigation is ongoing. The provider has ceased vaccinating, and there is no continuing risk to the public. However, reactions have been identified more than 12 weeks after vaccination, and patients may continue to present beyond this timeframe. We have no evidence to suggest manufacturer (pre-provider) contamination of the needles or syringes. Consequently, we do not recommend specific testing for bloodborne pathogens such as HIV or hepatitis B.

Specimens can be submitted through your regular laboratory network or directly to the Kentucky State Division of Laboratory Services (DLS) for those with access to the Outreach system. For more information, visit the Kentucky DLS website: https://chfs.ky.gov/agencies/dph/dls/Pages/default.aspx, or call Rachel Zinner or Rhonda Lucas at 502-564-4446. Laboratories should not discard specimens until KDPH has received reports and advised providers and laboratories about next steps.

KDPH requests information on any patient with an adverse vaccination reaction with onset on or after 1 Sep 2018. Any adverse vaccination reaction should be reported on the Department of Health and Human Services' Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) at: https://vaers.hhs.gov/. For the current situation, all vaccine reactions, positive lab results, or diagnoses consistent with the information above should also be reported to the Kentucky Department for Public Health via phone or secure fax. Phone number: 1-888-9-REPORT Secure fax: 502-696-3803.

With flu season and the ongoing hepatitis A outbreak, we urge you to continue to vaccinate at-risk populations. Thank you for your assistance in this matter!

Respectfully,

Mel Bennett, MD, MPH
Director, Infectious Disease Branch

[The non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) (a grouping outside of the _M. tuberculosis_ complex) are classified on the basis of in vitro growth rate, colonial pigmentation and molecular diagnostics. Rapidly growing mycobacterium (RGM) produce mature growth on agar plates within 7 days of incubation and include the _M. fortuitum_ complex and the _M. chelonae-abscessus_ group. RGM are found in soil and natural and processed water sources worldwide. _M. fortuitum_ readily forms biofilms, which likely contributes to their persistence in water sources and resistance to antimicrobial agents (https://academic.oup.com/femsle/article/168/1/77/947756). RGM cause pulmonary infections, skin and soft-tissue infections, surgical and traumatic wound infections, keratitis, implanted device infections, catheter-related infections, disseminated disease in the immunocompromised, as well as injection-site infections as in the outbreak described above. _M. fortuitum_ is a well-known pathogen causing injection-site infections (1-3). In fact, DaCosta Cruz 1st described _M. fortuitum_ in 1938 isolated from an abscess in a patient who had received subcutaneous injections (4).

This outbreak of injection-site _M. fortuitum_ infections reported by the CDC occurred after 1 Sep 2018 in 3 different clinic sites located in different U.S. states, affecting more than 100 people and involved multiple different vaccines and one vaccination provider. We are told that neither the vaccines nor the needles or syringes (pre-provider) were the problem; but we are not told the exact manner in which multiple vaccinations were contaminated with _M. fortuitum_. More information on this outbreak would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources.
