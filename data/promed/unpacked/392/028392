A mule in Aiken County has tested positive for equine infectious anemia (EIA), which is caused by a virus related to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). [This may be a misleading sentence: the EIA virus is a lentivirus like the HIV virus and like HIV, EIA can be transmitted through blood, saliva, milk, and body secretions. - Mod.TG] It is the 1st case of EIA in more than a decade.

Testing done at the Clemson University Veterinary Diagnostic Center in Columbia and National Veterinary Services Laboratories in Ames, Iowa, confirmed the initial results this week, according to SC state veterinarian Boyd Parr. The EIA virus weakens the horse's immune system, causing disease the same way HIV does in people. While humans are not at risk for infection with EIA, similarities of EIA to HIV show how serious an infection it can be in horses and why "we still are adamant about preventing the spread and attempting to eradicate this disease from the equine population," Parr said.

"This 16 year old mule is the 1st equine of South Carolina origin to be initially found positive for EIA since the 1990s," Parr said. "South Carolina is the only south eastern state that did not record a new positive EIA horse between 2003-2013. The positive mule has been humanely euthanized under our supervision and no longer poses any risk to other horses." The affected mule did not show any outward signs of its EIA infection. State officials will continue their investigation to determine if other equine may have been exposed that require additional quarantine and testing.

The Coggins test is the common name for the laboratory test that will determine if a horse is infected with the EIA virus. Veterinarian Leroy Coggins and his research team developed the diagnostic test at Cornell University in the 1970s. Its promotion and adoption by animal health authorities and equine industry leaders around the world has helped reduce the spread of the disease and its impact on the horse population, according to Parr.

"Many horses in South Carolina have never been tested for EIA and these horses are our highest-risk group for undetected EIA infection," said Adam Eichelberger, director of Animal Health Programs in the state veterinarian's office. "This new diagnosis serves as a wake-up call for us and should remind horse owners of the importance of continuing to test for the disease, even in horses that appear perfectly healthy."

All horses going to a public assembly in South Carolina are required by law to have a negative test for EIA within 12 months. All horses entering from another state are subject to the same requirement. A negative EIA test prior to a change of ownership is highly recommended, say veterinarians and animal health officials.

Readers are strongly encouraged to see the APHIS (Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service) information on EIA at http://www.aphis.usda.gov/publications/animal_health/content/printable_version/fs_equine_infectious_anemia.pdf.

When horses are exposed to equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV), they may develop severe, acute signs of disease and die within 2 to 3 weeks. This form of the disease is the most damaging and the most difficult to diagnose because the signs appear rapidly, and often only an elevated body temperature is noted. 1/5 of a teaspoon [1 mL. - Mod.SH] of blood from a horse with acute EIA contains enough virus to infect 1 million horses.

The clinical signs of the acute form of EIA are nonspecific; in mild cases, the initial fever ay be short lived (often less than 24 hours). As a result, horse owners and veterinarians may not observe this initial sign when a horse is infected with EIAV. These infected horses often recover and continue to move freely in the population. The 1st indication that a horse was exposed to, and infected with, EIAV may well be a positive result on a routine annual test.

If the horse survives this 1st acute bout, it may develop a recurring clinical disease with these signs:
- fever: an infected horse's temperature may rise suddenly to about 105 deg F [40.6 deg C] or, rarely, as high as 108 deg F [42.2 deg C]. Then it may drop back to normal for an indeterminate period until the onset of another episode.
- petechial hemorrhages: minute blood-colored spots appear on the mucous membranes.
- depression: the horse appears more or less dejected (head hangs low) and generally listless.
- weight loss: the horse may refuse feed or may eat an inordinate amount but still continues on an obvious decline from normal weight.
- dependent edema: the horse may develop swelling, which is evidence of fluid collecting under the skin in the legs and under the chest and other underbody surfaces.
- anemia: the horse's blood may experience a marked drop in its red corpuscle count and appear thin and watery. The animal may also have an irregular heartbeat, and a jugular pulse may become evident.

The horse with chronic EIA is the classic "swamper" who has lost condition, is lethargic and anorexic, has a low hematocrit, and demonstrates a persistent decrease in the number of blood platelets, especially coincident with fever induced by EIAV. 1/5 of a teaspoon [1 mL. - Mod.SH] of blood from a chronic case during a feverish episode contains enough virus to infect 10 000 horses.

By far the majority of horses are inapparent carriers: they show no overt clinical abnormalities as a result of infection. They survive as reservoirs of the infection for extended periods. Inapparent carriers have dramatically lower concentrations of EIAV in their blood than horses with active clinical signs of the disease. Only 1 horsefly out of 6 million is likely to pick up and transmit EIAV from this horse. All horses infected with EIAV are thought to remain virus carriers for life. The inapparent form may become chronic or acute due to severe stress, hard work, or the presence of other diseases.

EIA is considered a classic bloodborne infection. People have played an important role in EIAV transmission over the years by using blood-contaminated materials on different horses. The EIAV most frequently is transmitted between horses in close proximity by large biting insects, such as horseflies and deerflies. The bites from these flies stimulate defensive movement by the horse, which often results in an interruption of the blood-feeding. When interrupted, the fly is motivated to complete the feeding as soon as possible. It then attacks the same or a 2nd host and feeds to repletion. In this manner, any infective material from the blood of the 1st host that is present on the mouthparts of the insect can be mechanically transmitted to the 2nd host. Insect transmission of EIAV is dependent on the number and habits of the insects, the density of the horse population, the number of times the insect bites the same and other horses, the amount of blood transferred between horses, and the level of virus in the blood of the infected horse from which the initial blood meal was obtained. The rate of transmission cannot be predicted accurately because of these variables.

Controlling the spread of EIAV involves minimizing or eliminating contact of horses with the secretions, excretions, and blood of EIAV-infected horses. This has been carried out in most areas of the world by testing and segregating test-positive horses from those with negative test results. Once the reservoirs of EIAV are identified, separated, and maintained a safe distance from the other horses, the transmission of EIAV is broken. Until all horses are tested, one must assume that each horse is a potential reservoir of EIAV and take precautions to see that his or her horses commingle only with horses with impeccable backgrounds (that is, they came from farms with only test-negative horses and have never been exposed to test-positive horses).
