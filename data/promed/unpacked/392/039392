Health authorities in Egypt on Thursday [11 Dec 2014] reported the country's 8th death this year [2014] from [H5N1] bird flu. "A woman of 33 originally from Sohag province (in the south) has died of the H5N1 virus," health ministry spokesman Hossam Abdel Ghafar told AFP. He said another person is still being treated, and added that 7 patients diagnosed this year with bird flu were cured.

The H5N1 strain has killed more than 400 people worldwide since 1st appearing in 2003, mainly in Southeast Asia. It is one of several deadly or potentially deadly strains of bird flu that are closely monitored by the World Health Organisation. The strain is different from the H5N8 version, whose spread on European poultry farms has prompted WHO calls for vigilance. A 3rd strain of bird flu -- H7N9 -- has killed more than 170 people since emerging in 2013.

[Human cases of avian influenza H5N1 virus infection 1st appeared in 2003, affecting 16 countries in middle Asia and the Far East. Subsequently there has been a gradual decline in the number of cases, but still with Egypt and Indonesia predominating. There has been little evidence of direct transmission of H5N1 virus from person to person, and case numbers have correlated with the habit of rearing various species of poultry in homes and allotments.
