In your comments regarding Bluetongue you suggested that it occurred
'throughout the US and Canada'.
To the best of my knowledge, CanadaÂ´s only Bluetongue occurrences have been
confined to the Okanagan Valley, B.C. There are movement control
restrictions for livestock out of this area. There have been some imported
instances of Bluetongue, as with other countries, but these have been traced
back to US imports believed to have been infected at time of importation.
The generally accepted position on Bluetongue in Canada is that there is no
competent vector, outside the Okanagan Valley.
Even inside the Okanagan Valley, occurrences of Bluetongue are rare. Last
summer there was an outbreak, with 2 animals confirmed as positive. The
outbreak before that was several years ago. Sentinel animals are in place.
There are movement controls, as noted above.
Canada is recognized internationally as being Bluetongue-free except for the
Okanagan Valley. This confers a number of trade benefits in the
international market place, for our cattle and sheep based industries. The
distinction results in preferential access to some markets, and access of
any sort to some others.
Suggest you may want to confirm the above with the Canadian Food Inspection
Agency. You can do so via Dr. Claude Lavigne, Deputy Director, Animal
Health & Production Division (clavigne@em.agr.ca). We don't need trading
partners getting the idea that we're not free.

[In the ProMED posting Epizootic hem. disease, deer - USA (New Jersey) (02)
990913234621, the wording of the statement is in error. I offer my
apologies. The statement should have read that bluetongue has occurred in
one very limited area of Canada and throughout the US. - Mod.TG

Subject: Bluetongue in Canada

Thanks for your diligence in obtaining accurate information of this very
important topic. Matt's comments are accurate but I would add two areas of
clarifications.
1) We have had 4 incursions in the Okanagan Valley since 1975.
2) What he refers to as "imported instances" were not clinical cases but
only serological cases and in none of these cases to my knowledge is there
evidence that seroconversion occurred in Canada.

The moderator in comments alluded to the distribution of Epizootic
Hemorrhagic Disease (EHD) and Bluetongue within Canada. In response to the
misinformation conveyed, I would note Bluetongue and EHD have been the
subject of continuous surveillance throughout Canada for 25 years, since
Bluetongue was first detected in its only recognized periodic focus, the
lower Okanagan Valley of British Columbia.
Cattle, the vector's preferred host, are tested serologically at slaughter
every 3 years, with systematic random sampling occurring at a level designed
to disclose, with 95% confidence, a national rate of infection of 0.02% or
higher. Within the Okanagan Valley itself, at 5 sites of highest historic
sero-prevalence, reside sentinel cattle herds.
On the basis of the above and elevated, ancillary regional serological
testing within the provinces of British Columbia and Alberta, incursions of
Bluetongue serotype 11 have been documented within the limited Okanagan
Valley focus on 4 occasions.
Age-specific prevalence rates associated with the testing of the Okanagan
Valley's entire domestic, and husbanded wild, ruminant populations in 1976
and 1977 suggested an incursion in 1972. Passive surveillance detected
clinical infection of domestic and husbanded wild ruminants in 1987.
Sentinel cattle herds, established subsequent to that outbreak, revealed
incursions in 1988 and 1998. No clinical, virological or serological
evidence of infection has been revealed except in animals from the Okanagan
Valley of British Columbia, which experience these periodic northward
extensions from the state of Washington.
Until 1998, the triennial national serological surveys employed a primary
screening regimen whose diagnostic scope included Bluetongue and Epizootic
Hemorrhagic Disease. The limited number of reactions which, by secondary
serum neutralization, were shown referable to EHD, derived almost
exclusively from cattle native to the Okanagan Valley.
For further information on Canada's status referable to these two diseases,
the reader may wish to conduct a Medline search for articles by Sellers RF
