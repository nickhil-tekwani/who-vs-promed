Disease outbreak news, 22 Jul 1999

Disease outbreaks reported
---------------------------------------
While every effort is made to present verified information on these pages,
in the early stages of outbreaks, the picture may be unclear. In such
instances we will clearly indicate that the information is not yet fully
verified. Such basic information as the nature of the clinical illness, the
number and location of cases, and confirmation of the diagnosis may likewise
be unavailable. Reports from different sources may give
conflicting data. Through contact with national health authorities, we
intend to provide timely and accurate information about major events and
offer prompt updates as the picture unfolds.
22 July 1999
Unknown illness in the Russian Federation
------------------------------------------
On 1 July 1999, WHO was notified that the Ivanovsky Institute of Virology
had confirmed 4 cases of Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever ( see the WHO fact
sheet on CCHF) in the Stavropol region between the Black sea and the Caspian
sea. Of the 4 cases, 2 were fatal. The Ministry of Health reported the
situation to be under control.
On 17 July [1999, cases of an unknown disease were reported by the press in
the
village of Oblivskaia, north of Stavropol, in the region between Volgograd
and Rostov-on Don, many of them among children. The first case was reported
to have occurred on 5 July, and up to 8 deaths have been associated with
this illness. Eighty-one patients are said to have been admitted to hospital
in the region. On 19 July [1999, press reports also mentioned 32 similar
cases in the Volgograd city area, including 1
adolescent originating from Oblivskaia. Press reports have suggested a link
between the unknown illness and the 4 CCHF cases confirmed at the beginning
of July in Stavropol, but at the moment there is inadequate clinical or
epidemiological information to support any link.
The WHO Regional Office for Europe is in contact with the local health
authorities for verification of these events.

[Notice the disclaimer at the beginning of this report. This is from the
WHO CSR web page. It's interesting that there are reports based on the
newswires pre: confirmation with local health authorities. Usually WHO
waits for confirmation from the formal health sector before issuing an
alert - MPP
[*****This is a very welcome development. For too long, reporting of new
outbreaks by WHO has been delayed by having to wait for official clearance -

Interfax reported today that the number of deaths in the Stavropol Region is
4. Also from Interfax: total of 66 cases in Rostov region, 6 deaths, 24
still in hospital of whom 8 are in serious condition and 1 in critical
condition.
BBC quoting Itar-Tass repeats that number of cases in Rostov is 90, 6 dead,
29 discharged from hospital with 10 to be discharged shortly. But the BBC
report contradicts previous reports of no new cases: it says 2 patients
with preliminary diagnosis of the disease were admitted to hospital in the
past 2 days. [Possible interpretation: no new confirmed cases, but 2
possible positives. The hospitalized patients include 3 medical workers,
including one anesthesist who is in grave condition.

The following comment came in reply to a ProMED-mail message I forwarded to
a colleague who is living in Stavropol:
"First, yes, there is an epidemic of CCHF in Rostov/Stavropol regions. It
occurred first in Rostov region and has seeped into Stavropol and another
region. It is tentatively identified as CCHF. The actual identification will
be next week (I don't know why it takes so long).
When we got back from the Black Sea (week of vacation) on 17 Jul 1999 the TV
was covering the crisis. Margaret (my wife) was extremely concerned as it
was reported to be carried by ticks in stage 1 and to be aerosol (multiple
doctors caught the virus). I cannot tell you when it was first reported
except to say we heard nothing on 8 Jul 1999 when we left.
I looked everywhere on MSNBC web site (my only regular news source) and
found nothing. Glad to hear that the outside public hears something."

[*****First, we highly commend this sort of initiative by our subscribers.
If you know of a friend or colleague living in the area of a reported new
outbreak, please pass our reports on to them with a request for an
update.*********
Second, reports say that 2 of the 3 doctors who became infected are now out
of danger. Hospital staff are much more exposed to ´aerosol´ transmission
than the general public, since they have to peer into patients´ body
cavities, mop up their blood & excrement, give them injections & perform
cut-downs to put in needles for transfusions.
Third, there still seems to be a belief on the spot that the Stavropol
epidemic is an extension of the Rostov CCHF outbreak rather than a separate
episode with a different cause. We shall see - Mod.JW
