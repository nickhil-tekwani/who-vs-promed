Three Letters Show Anthrax Contamination
----------------------------------------
Preliminary positives on N.Y., Nev. letters.
Preliminary tests on letters mailed to NBC News in New York and a
Microsoft Licensing office in Reno, Nevada, have indicated the presence
of anthrax, officials reported today.
Meanwhile, a suspicious letter received by a New York Times reporter
tested negative for any anthrax or chemical strains. The letter,
received Friday, had the same handwriting and St. Petersburg, Fla.,
postmark as a letter to NBC News, and also contained a white powder.
Latest Reports: Yes in Nevada, No in California
A source close to the federal investigation into other possible anthrax
incidents told ABCNEWS that 2 letters at other locations also have
shown positive results in preliminary tests. A letter sent to a
Microsoft Licensing office in Reno, Nev., also tested positive for
anthrax in preliminary examinations.
So far, no one [in Reno] has tested positive for the disease or become ill.
Six
people came into immediate contact with the letter and they are the only
ones being monitored for possible exposure to anthrax, Guinn said. "This
is a very, very low risk to public health," Guinn said.
In California, a source told ABCNEWS that a letter sent to Sony Pictures
Entertainment in Culver City tested positive Friday for anthrax. But a
Sony spokesman said today that nothing had tested positive for anthrax.
Susan Tick, senior vice president for corporate communications, said a
temporary employee reported going through old mail and coming in contact
with some white powder. The local fire department was contacted but
officials did not find any powder to test, Tick said. The employee was
tested for anthrax but was not admitted to the hospital, she said. Matt
McLaughlin, an FBI (news - web sites) spokesman in Los Angeles, said
authorities had tested a suspicious package found at Sony for anthrax
and it tested false. "The situation has been regarded as a hoax," he
said.
NBC, New York Times Scares
--------------------------
Officials revealed Friday that a personal assistant to NBC news anchor Tom
Brokaw contracted cutaneous, or "skin," anthrax - less dangerous than
inhaled anthrax and rarely fatal if treated. On 25 Sep 2001, the assistant
opened a piece of suspicious mail with powder inside that was postmarked 20
Sep 2001.
Tests showed the powder was negative for anthrax but today, New York
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani announced that a second threatening letter
postmarked 18 Sep 2001 was sent to Brokaw and this one tested positive for
anthrax. Unlike the 20 Sep 2001 letter, which sources said had a St.
Petersburg postmark, the 18 Sep 2001 letter was postmarked in Trenton, N.J.
At The New York Times, officials announced that a powdery white substance
in an envelope sent to one of its reporters tested negative for anthrax and
other dangerous biological materials. The CDC is conducting more tests but
results are not expected until Tuesday, said Times spokeswoman Catherine
Mathis. The Times envelope was similar to the one received by the infected
NBC employee, and was also postmarked from St. Petersburg, Fla., and
contained no return address. Giuliani said the handwriting on both pieces
of mail was similar, but offered no further details.
Several floors of the NBC headquarters at 30 Rockefeller Center will
remain closed for at least a few days as health officials test the
building. So far, 358 employees have been tested along with other
workers in the area.

Five More Anthrax [Exposures] Found in Florida
----------------------------------------
Five more people in South Florida have been found to be exposed to anthrax,
according to officials of American Media, the Boca Raton publishing company
where 3 other people had been exposed to the disease. Michael Kahane,
general counsel of the company, said that blood tests of the 5 people found
anthrax antibodies. He said the 5 are being treated with antibiotics and
are not hospitalized. He said he was notified today by a governmental
agency and had started to inform employees.
Federal health officials would not comment on the blood test results. On
Friday federal authorities said they had completed testing of nearly all
of the 1000 people connected to the American Media building here and
found no new cases of anthrax exposure. Officials believe anthrax
entered the American Media building through the mail and said on Friday
that they believed the building's mail room was the primary
contamination area.

NBC, New York City
------------------
A second NBC employee had possible symptoms of anthrax, including a
low-grade fever, swollen lymph nodes and a rash, health officials said.
The employee, who was not identified, was taking antibiotics, said Neal
Shapiro, the network's news president. "She's fine," he said.
It was initially believed that [a] letter, received 25 Sep 2001, could have
infected [the woman], but it subsequently tested negative for anthrax.
Authorities said Saturday that the 18 Sep 2001 New Jersey letter had tested
positive for the bacteria. The earlier letter was found at the network's
Manhattan headquarters when city police and FBI officials searched the
offices, said Barry Mawn, head of the FBI's New York office. The
anonymous letter, which bore no return address, contained an unspecified
threat and a brown granular substance, Mawn said. Most of it was thrown
away, but the letter - one of several threatening ones the network
received since the attacks - was retained, he said.
The FBI could not immediately pinpoint where the letter was dropped
because Trenton is a regional processing center for southern and central
New Jersey, said Special Agent Sandra Carroll, a spokeswoman for the
FBI's Newark office. "There's over 100 different collection boxes or
post offices it could have come from," Carroll said. FBI agents were
interviewing mail carriers in Trenton on Saturday as part of a joint
investigation with postal inspectors, she said.
Elsewhere, New York City
------------------------
Still, spooked New Yorkers scurried to emergency rooms and pharmacies
for anthrax tests and prescriptions for the antibiotic Cipro. Some
drugstores ran out, or limited the amounts they would sell to customers.
At the Hilltop Pharmacy, a sign warned customers they could get only a
5-day supply of 10 Cipro pills. "We're filling it right now about 75
times more than usual," pharmacist Amy Sidney said. [Five days is
adequate. - Mod.MHJ]
A letter containing powder also was sent to The New York Times, but the
newspaper said Saturday that the white substance in the envelope
received by reporter Judith Miller - who co-wrote a recent best seller
on bioterrorism - tested negative for anthrax. Results from additional
tests by the CDC were not expected until Tuesday, Times spokeswoman
Catherine Mathis said. Miller and about 30 co-workers in the area when
the envelope was opened are taking antibiotics, and results of their
anthrax tests will be released Monday, the newspaper said.
Nevada
------
In Nevada, Gov. Kenny Guinn said a third anthrax test on a letter sent
from Malaysia to a Microsoft office in Reno came back positive, but
added that the risk to public health was "very, very low." Four
Microsoft employees have been tested to date, with the results expected
Monday or Tuesday, company spokesman Matt Pilla said. "If the CDC
results are positive for a disease-causing strain, there's still a very
low risk for anyone outside the 4 who had direct contact with the
envelope," Pilla said. [I have been informed that this is a vaccine
strain, probably Sterne. Confirmation is awaited. If so, it is a
separate incident from those in the east. - Mod.MHJ]
Florida
-------
American Media was notified by the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (news - web sites) on Saturday that 5 employees had shown
antibodies of anthrax in their blood, according to Gerald McKelvey, a
spokesman for American Media Inc. "It means they had an exposure," he
said. "It doesn't mean they have anthrax." None of the 5 were sick or
in the hospital, said Michael Kahane, the company's general counsel.
Health officials had been waiting for results of more than 35 anthrax
tests checking employees and visitors to the company's headquarters,
which investigators in white moon suits continued to search Saturday.
About 20 postal employees who handled the company's mail were also
awaiting test results. On Friday, the FBI agent said test results of 965
people who were in the building recently found no new infections.
In Florida, the FBI's hazardous materials team also tested various St.
Petersburg post offices for anthrax, said Linda Walker, an inspector
with the U.S. Postal Inspection Service in Tampa.
Washington
----------
An envelope with a powdery substance on the outside was found in the
mail at CBS News' Washington bureau on Saturday. The envelope was turned
over to the FBI, which was testing the powder for anthrax, CBS News
spokeswoman Sandy Genelius. [The FBI was called in to investigate a
white powder at the State Department in an office that deals with
congressional correspondence. FBI and hazardous materials squads were
also dispatched to the State Department's Foreign Service Institute in
Arlington, Virginia, on Friday to investigate another suspicious white
powdery substance. - Mod.MHJ]

Reno case's Malaysia link
-------------------------
The Nevada Division of Emergency Management said Microsoft Licensing
Inc., which handles licensing of Microsoft software, received a letter
that had originally been sent from the company in Reno to Malaysia -- a
country where there are known cells of Osama bin Laden's al Qaeda
terrorist network -- and then was returned to the Reno office.
Nevada Gov. Kenny Guinn told CNN the letter included a check. When it
was returned, it contained the check and pornographic materials, Guinn
said. He said there was no powder in the letter when it was returned,
but that it looked like it had been damp and then dried out. Hunt said
there was no powder or residue on the letter. "We believe that the
person who handled the envelope is at a low risk for infection even if
it turns out to be anthrax," she said.

F.B.I. Did Not Test Letter to NBC [n]or Immediately Notify City Hall
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Although the Federal Bureau of Investigation was notified on 25 Sep 2001
about a suspicious letter sent to NBC, neither the letter, nor the
powder residue inside it were tested until at least 2 weeks later,
when a private doctor notified city public health officials about a
troubling skin condition in the news assistant who had opened the
letter, officials acknowledged yesterday. F.B.I. officials said that
after the agency was notified of the envelope containing white powder on
25 Sep 2001, it did not pick up the letter until the next day and then did
not analyze the powder itself nor did it attempt to take tissue samples
from the employee, identified as a 38-year-old assistant to Tom Brokaw,
agency officials said.
"That, unfortunately, did not take place," said Barry W. Mawn, special
agent in charge of the F.B.I.'s New York office. Further, New York City
officials were not informed of the preliminary inquiry until days later.
On Sept. 25., an assistant to Mr. Brokaw opened a letter postmarked from
St. Petersburg, Fla., filled with white powder, according to law
enforcement officials. Network officials, immediately suspicious, called
the F.B.I.
On 28 Sep 2001, the NBC employee, whom the network did not identify,
developed a strange sore on her chest. Nervous, she went to see Dr.
Richard Fried, a Manhattan infectious disease specialist, said Dr.
Annetta Kimball, the doctor covering for Dr. Fried, who could not be
reached last night. Armed with the description of the rash - which she
described as central scarring surrounded by a lot of swelling - the
doctor likely consulted his textbooks to nail down what was going on.
Dr. Kimball said that Dr. Fried suspected that his patient had been
exposed to anthrax, and immediately prescribed Cipro.
"There is a good chance he had never seen anthrax before," said Dr.
Kimball. "This is New York City, not an agricultural area." He also took
cultures from a wound she developed, but those swabs were negative for
anthrax, she said.
At some point, officials and Dr. Kimball said, the patient was believed
to have visited a dermatologist and possibly another infectious disease
expert. One of those doctors notified the city's Health Department on
6 Oct 2001 of a possible case of anthrax. The city has among the most
sophisticated epidemiologists and labs of any municipal or state health
laboratory in the country.

[So far, there would appear to be three incidents -- 2 on the east
coast which may or may not be related, depending on the strain
identification of the various isolates, and the Nevada incident, which,
if it is confirmed that it is a vaccine strain, may then be by a nasty
minded opportunist. - Mod.MHJ]
