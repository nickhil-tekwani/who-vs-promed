[According to the most recent update information available from the Hong Kong Centre for Health Protection (CHP), as of 5 Apr 2014, there were a total of 401 laboratory confirmed cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) in mainland China. The provincial breakdown of confirmed human cases is: Zhejiang (138 cases), Guangdong (98 cases), Jiangsu (48 cases), Shanghai (41 cases), Fujian (22 cases), Hunan (20 cases), Anhui (11 cases), Jiangxi (6 cases), Beijing (4 cases), Henan (4 cases), Guangxi (3 cases), Shandong (3 cases), Guizhou (1 case, imported from Zhejiang), Hebei (1 case), and Jilin (1 case). The CHP report includes a 73 year old male case in Jiangsu not as yet reported in the WHO update (http://www.chp.gov.hk/en/content/599/34222.html).

Four of the 5 newly reported cases in the WHO updates presented above have a history of exposure to poultry, suggesting that direct exposure to poultry continues to be a primary route of transmission of the avian influenza A(H7N9) virus to humans.
