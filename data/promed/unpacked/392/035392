Comment on " Respiratory infections, fatal, gorillas - Africa"
--------------------------------------------------------------
Having just trekked in the mountains of Uganda to see these beautiful
animals, I have the following comments. Please note that I have not been
able to locate a publication that gives the scientific data, such as how
they determined the cause of death, so I am responding to the news service
report and the moderator's comments.
1. The 7 meter distance is announced but not observed. We were certainly
closer than that much of the time. But what is magic about 7 meters?
2. Although the tourists are asked not to go if they are ill, I learned of
one person (not with my group) who went anyway. Unless someone is sneezing
or coughing or obviously ill, there is no way for the local guide to know
who is sick.
3. What is the evidence that the influenza A viruses or the parainfluenza
viruses came from humans? Gorillas certainly have their own respiratory
viral pathogens.
4. Even if someone is sick and is closer than 7 meters, what is the risk
for transmission from a human with a viral infection? CDC uses 3 feet as a
guideline for droplet transmission. Aerosol transmission is unlikely
outdoors. Even if one were concerned about aerosol transmission, one
airplane study of tuberculosis suggested that the risk is small more than 2
rows from the index case.
It would be interesting to know which deaths occurred in which years, since
the deaths go back to 1968.
It was a thrill to observe the gorillas and I support all efforts to
protect them. At the same time, it is important not to let our concern for
these animals cloud scientific observations.
These are my personal opinions and do not necessarily reflect those of the
Department of Veterans Affairs or anyone in the department.
