Hong Kong hospital gets scare from virus that causes miscarriages
More than 100 pregnant women underwent blood tests for a virus that can
cause miscarriages after three medical staff at a Hong Kong hospital were
found to have been infected with the disease, the hospital said on Friday.
The parvovirus B19, which causes fever, fatigue, rashes and pain in joints,
was a risk for pregnant women of 24 weeks or less and for people with weak
immune systems, the Queen Mary Hospital said. However, there was a less
than 1 percent chance of miscarriage when exposed to the virus and the risk
to pregnancies past 24 weeks was negligible, it said.
The infected staff members, a nurse and two doctors, were from the
hospital's obstetrics and gynecology ward. The hospital said it had
contacted most of the patients who may have been exposed and 113 patients
had already been interviewed and counseled by a specialist. Physical
examinations and laboratory tests had been conducted and all those tested
for the virus so far had shown no evidence of acute infection, it said.
Hong Kong has been hit by a number of health scares in the past year.
CDPC Note: Parovirus B19 is a ubiquitous virus. Diagnosis of this agent
requires a good virus laboratory. Fortunately, or unfortunately, the virus
laboratory in Hong Kong was able to detect this virus and the H5N1
influenza virus earlier this year.
