A case of anthrax has now been discovered in the Chaplin area
-----------------------------------------------
The C-F-I-A [Canadian Food Inspection Agency] has confirmed a
positive cattle death from anthrax. Swift Current Veterinarian Doctor
Doug Mann says if producers should have a suspicious animal death on
their farm, they should notify their veterinarian immediately.
Dr. Mann says the farm where the animal was found has been
quarantined as a precaution. Producers within a 6-km radius from the
originating farm will be notified and encouraged to vaccinate their
herds as a precaution.

3 cattle dead on one farm
-----------------------------
A farm in the Chaplin area has lost 3 cattle to anthrax, the Canadian
Food Inspection Agency said Friday [21 Jul 2006]. CFIA personnel went
to the location earlier in the week, after a lab test in Saskatoon
showed positive for anthrax, said Dr. Sandra Stephens of the CFIA
Saskatoon office. "A private practitioner sent us a sample to test
after the owner found a suspicious death." There are now 3 anthrax
deaths at that location, she said. "That premises was quarantined,
and the cattle were vaccinated at the 1st part of this week. The
quarantine lasts 21 days from either the time that they're vaccinated
or 21 days from the last anthrax-related death," Stephens said. "We
usually do not see mortalities after 7 or 8 days post-vaccination."
Previously, anthrax had been showing up in Saskatchewan this summer
2006 in the northeast region. As of the latest count Friday [21 Jul
2006], 216 animals had died on 50 farms.
Stephens said farmers should talk to their veterinarians about
whether they should vaccinate against the disease in their herds.
Dead animals are either burned or buried deeply to avoid further
contamination, Stephens said. The agency can't predict whether the
anthrax will pop up again in the district, she said. The disease is
spread by spores in the soil. "We understand that there are spores
buried potentially almost anywhere across the Prairies, so it's not
unexpected to see cases occur in various places across the Prairies,"
Stephens said.
There have been higher than usual numbers of cases in the northeast,
a region affected by heavy rains and flooding this spring. Stephens
said anthrax can surface where there is excessive moisture. "You
bring these spores that have been buried, perhaps for decades, in the
soil to the surface."
Cattle may also be exposed to anthrax when standing water dries up,
exposing areas they normally wouldn't graze on.
Excavation work can also inadvertently bring spores to the surface, she said.

[As ever, many thanks to Sandra, and any mistakes are mine, not hers.
I would not be surprised to see a secondary cluster develop or one
that has developed around Torch River RM and its many affected large
animals. With outbreaks as far west as Prince Albert and as far south
as Humboldt, the original epidemic has certainly expanded. With the
outbreak in Chaplin, it is clear that with increased awareness,
random sporadic anthrax deaths, which might otherwise be missed, are
being caught. - Mod.MHJ]

To date, anthrax has affected 6 herds of cattle in the southeast part
of the province, resulting in the deaths of 52 cattle. One horse has
also died of anthrax.
Quarantine and livestock vaccination is the standard method of
controlling anthrax when identified in a herd. Local veterinarians
can vaccinate cattle on farms around the infected herd to safeguard
the health of cattle living close to the quarantined area.
If a producer suspects anthrax, he or she should contact their veterinarian:
- to rule out other causes of sudden death,
- to collect and submit the proper samples, and
- to avoid handling the carcass.
Restricted movement only applies to cattle from quarantined farms.
