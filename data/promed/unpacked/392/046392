15 people in Armenia's northern and northwestern regions of Lori and Shirak were hospitalized after local health authorities suspected they were infected with anthrax, the health ministry said.

According to a statement placed on the ministry's official website, 3 people in the village of Artagyuh, Lori region were found on 4 Oct 2013 to have cutaneous (skin) anthrax. This caused health authorities to examine the village residents and discover 8 more people suspected to be infected with the disease. Lab tests confirmed that 7 of them had cutaneous anthrax. The ministry said laboratory investigations are continuing.

These people have been hospitalized and are receiving appropriate treatment. The doctors said their condition is moderate with an improvement trend.

A deeper study found that the probable cause of the infection was eating the meat of dead animals. Part of that meat had been sent to Gyumri. A subsequent study in Gyumri found 4 people suspected to be infected with anthrax. They were hospitalized; the laboratory research has not yet been completed. The ministry said its experts are working to detect and localize people with anthrax.

Before that, the skin form of anthrax was discovered in Armenia in March 2013 in 2 people. One of them was a citizen of Georgia.

Several cases of animals with anthrax were reported in October 2012 in Gegharkunik province. This was followed by hospitalization of 21 people with symptoms of the disease. Laboratory studies confirmed the presence of anthrax in one of them. In early November 2012 (last year), the disease was detected in a resident of Ushi village in Aragatsotn. Reports about anthrax-infected animals came also from Tavush and Armavir regions.

Anthrax is an infection caused by bacteria called _Bacillus anthracis_. These bacteria make spores, a form of the germ covered by a protective shell. The spores can live for years in the soil, and they cause anthrax when they enter the body. Although the disease is most common in farm animals -- like sheep, cows, and goats -- there is a small chance that people can get it as well, usually from some type of contact with an animal or part of an animal that had anthrax.

[If these 15 human cases in 2 provinces had not been noted, one must suspect that the background livestock outbreak would never have come to official notice. This over dependence on public health surveillance means that the basic problem of livestock anthrax goes essentially unregarded and ignored, which is the most expensive way of controlling this zoonotic disease. It is an infectious disease of animals that spills over into humans and stops spreading among that species.

The livestock Sterne vaccine is both effective and cheap, and its proper use not only protects animals, it also protects humans without having to expensively vaccinate that latter group. And from the outbreaks this year and last [2012-2013], it is abundantly clear that the disease is widespread, not "sporadic," as officially claimed, in Armenian livestock.
