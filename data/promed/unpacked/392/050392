A diarrhea epidemic is sweeping across eastern India, leaving at
least 9 people dead and many more ill.
Despite the retreat of monsoons from most parts of India, various
regions in Bihar state continue to reel under the effect of
water-borne diseases. Several low-lying areas are still
submerged following heavy rains [during September 2003].
More than 200 people have died in floods in Bihar, touted as the
worst in many years.

A case of cholera was diagnosed in Platte County [Nebraska] about 1
month ago, health officials said. The patient was not from Platte
County and died from complications of multiple health problems. A
Columbus Community Hospital spokeswoman declined to confirm or deny
that a person was treated or tested for cholera at the hospital.
There is no threat of cholera to the area, according to Rebecca
Rayman, executive director of the East Central District Health
Department. The case was contained and there currently are no other
active cases in the area, Rayman said. The person already was sick
when [arriving in] Platte County from a foreign country.
Rayman declined to release additional details about the person,
including the country [of origin], when contacted by The
Associated Press.
Relatives of the patient have tested negative for cholera, which has
symptoms of watery diarrhea, vomiting, and leg cramps.
It is the state's first reported case of cholera in 2003, she said.
One case of cholera was reported in Nebraska in 2002, Augustine said.
That case was related to travel outside the country. Her records show
Nebraska has 1-2 cases of the disease every year and they're usually
travel-related, she said.
[The timing of this Nebraska case suggests that it is not the case from WHO
Weekly Epidemiological Record Notifications of 1 imported case of cholera in
the USA noted during 2-11 Jun 2003, posted in ProMED as Cholera, imported -
USA: RFI 20030816.2052. Cholera can be acquired in the USA from exposure to
water and/or seafood along the Gulf coast. - Mod.LL]

40 Die of Diarrhea in Northwest
-------------------------------
At least 40 people have died in the last 2 weeks from an unidentified
diarrheal disease in 3 villages northwest of the capital, Bangui, an
aid agency official said on Fri, 3 Oct 2003. Massimiliano Pedretti,
the representative of the Italian NGO Cooperazione Internazionale
(Coopi), said the dead were among 300 people who had reported to
clinics for treatment. He said Coopi officials had reported the
problem on 29 Sep 2003, adding that the EC's Humanitarian Office, ECHO had
supplied Coopi with antibiotics, serum, and oral rehydration salts to
treat the sick in the villages of Gouze, Lemouna and Pende, near the
northwestern town of Bozoum.
The exact source and cause of the outbreak is unknown, but the health
ministry, Coopi, Medicos Sin Fronteras, and the Pasteur Institute are
conducting tests. Bozoum, like other northern towns, has lacked safe
drinking water for over a year, due to the 6-month rebellion against
the government of former President Ange-Felix Patasse, which ended in
March 2003.
Pedretti said this situation could have occasioned the outbreak. A
similar outbreak was detected and contained in August 2003 in
Bocaranga, 510 km northwest of Bangui.
Meanwhile state-owned Radio Centrafrique reported on 3 Oct 2003 that
the state water utility, the Societe de Distribition des Eaux en
Centrafrique, had that same day started supplying Bozoum with safe
drinking water. Electricity supplies have also been restored there.

Cholera in Liberia - update 6
-----------------------------
The cholera outbreak in Monrovia remains a public health concern. As
of 21 Sep 2003, the total number of cases since the beginning of the
year is 18 038 with 17 561 occurring since the beginning of the
epidemic in June [2003] (see previous report
<http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_08_25/en/>).
During 15-21 Sep 2003, 2352 cases were reported by 12 of the 22 organizations
participating in the emergency surveillance system developed by WHO. The case
fatality rate is low (below 1 percent) in the cholera treatment centers run
by Medecins sans Frontieres France and Belgium and by MERLIN. Many
nongovernmental organizations have opened oral rehydration corners to
increase the coverage of the population.
The most affected places in Monrovia are Central Monrovia, Paynesville and
Sinkor. The caseload seems to be decreasing in Paynesville and Sinkor,
probably as the result of the widespread chlorination of wells undertaken
during the last 4 weeks by WHO and UNICEF. In Central Monrovia, the low
access to safe water and sanitation remains critical and limits the
effectiveness of control measures. An increase in cholera cases has also
occurred in Buchanan (Grand Bassa County).
An additional concern is the increase in bloody diarrhea (141 cases reported
during 15-21 Sep 2003 mainly in Central Monrovia and Paynesville) which might
be due to shigellosis. Laboratory tests are currently underway.

A cholera outbreak in Gusau has been reported by the media, 3 Sep
2003. Over 500 cases (74 deaths) of cholera were reported in Kano
State. Cholera is generally confined to slum areas with poor
sanitation facilities. Travelers should take particular care with
food and water hygiene.
