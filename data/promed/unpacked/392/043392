Foot-and-mouth disease confirmed in Hsinchu County
--------------------------------------------------
Taiwan's animal quarantine authorities reported Tuesday [21 Jul 2009]
the country's latest confirmed case of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD),
involving a pen of hogs at a meat market in Hsinchu County, northern
Taiwan. On 13 Jul 2009, 8 of the 9 hogs in the pen were discovered to
have blisters -- a symptom typical of FMD. The animals were
immediately destroyed.

According to officials at the Bureau of Animal and Plant Health
Inspection and Quarantine (BAPHIQ), tests on specimens taken from the
hogs confirmed that they had been infected with serotype O of the FMD
virus.

As the hogs had been enclosed overnight in the meat market, it was
likely that the hogs were infected in the facility, according to the
officials [see comment below]. The market was disinfected soon after
the discovery of FMD, and further disinfection efforts will be
carried out in the coming days when the market is not open for
business, they said.

They added that quarantine officials had already inspected the farm
where the hogs were raised but no abnormalities were discovered
there. The BAPHIQ, however, has restricted the movement of livestock
within the farm and has collected specimens for further tests, the
officials went on.

Sporadic FMD cases have been reported on pig farms in several parts
of the country since the start of this year [2009].

The cases have come just as Taiwan, which experienced a serious FMD
outbreak in 1997, has been working toward the goal of being listed as
a fully FMD-free country after having been recognized by the World
Organization for Animal Health (OIE) as an "FMD-free country with
vaccination" thanks to its efforts to eliminate the disease over the
past decade.

[If the hogs were found with blisters following a one-night stay in
the facility, it is rather difficult to believe they were infected
there; in pigs, the incubation period of FMD is usually 2 days or
more, though it can be as short as 18-24 hours.

A map, showing the location of the affected livestock market in the
northeast, is included in "Chinese Taipei" immediate notification to
the OIE on the current outbreak, submitted on 20 Jul 2009. The
notification is available at
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=8293>.

The epidemiological comments in the notification include, among
others, the following information: "The prefecture animal disease
control competent authority traced back to the farms of origin. The
clinical investigation showed that all pigs on farms were healthy.
Samples from the farms of origin were collected for serological tests
and virus isolation. The movement control of all pigs on farms of
origin was implemented. The serological test and virus detection of
the farms of origin are under way. This outbreak may originate from
the index livestock market."

In case the farms of origin had been vaccinated, clinical disease
there could be absent, vaccination masking subclinical infection.

Notably, in order to ensure the eradication of FMD virus, Chinese
Taipei uses non-vaccinated pigs as sentinel animals on every farm.

Final results of the laboratory tests are thus anticipated with
interest. -Mod.AS]
