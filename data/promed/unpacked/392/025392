Charity Needs Foundation (http://charityneeds.com/) is a UK registered charity, we promote other charities and organisations within the voluntary sector by writing articles.

I write to enquire whether you could help with an ongoing crisis The Italian Horse Protection (IHP) (http://horseprotection.it/ ) has suffered. Over the last 2 to 3 years (December 2018 until the present), since moving to a new premises, they have lost 19 horses. The deaths are quick and each horse has died within minutes of collapsing.

Although there has been extensive testing on the environment, as well as top experts looking at the post mortems they are still coming with a non-conclusive result. The problem lies in trying to isolate the toxin responsible which leaves the question whether it's environmental or intentional poisoning. In the meantime, it puts the IHP and all the other equines in their care in a very vulnerable situation. [This is assuming it is a toxin, and not an undiagnosed mineral/vitamin deficiency, or other disease. As you continue reading, you will note the results of some mineral/vitamin tests and possibly some toxicology test have not been reported. - Mod.TG]

Charity Needs have been doing updates in forms of articles to bring awareness to the IHP plight and we are about to release another. The links below are the back story which I included in my last email.

[2] First report

http://charityneeds.com/feature/horseprotection.it/sudden-death-of-horses/


It was just a few months back in December 2018 we released an article celebrating the association's news of a permanent home in 600 acres of land in the Volterra area of Tuscany. It was a joy not even the founder could believe had happened. But then...

That joy was short lived because the organization has been struggling to understand the sudden deaths of 9 out of the over 65 horses the association are responsible for.

For 2 weeks IHP kept the incident hidden from the media in the belief they could find an answer to the happenings and later explain them without causing public alarm or hysteria. The true alarm, however, is they have now found out that there are no suitable explanations to the causes of these sudden deaths, the 1st of which came 2 days after their move.

IHP believed the 1st death was attributed to a heart attack or aneurysm, but then another 2 horses died the next day and another a day later. Suspicions were rising and thoughts of something more sinister like deliberate poisoning had to be considered.

On the 4th day 4 more horses lost their lives one after the other. IHP were no longer thinking any of the deaths were down to heart attacks or the stress of the move. All these horses died in the same way so they started seeking professional help and alerted all the relevant authorities, including the police and the Ministry of Health.

A few days later, IHP lost another horse in the same mysterious way. Every horse that died was healthy with no external signs of illness and were happily grazing in their new home, but when the deaths occurred each one happened within a 3-8 minute timeframe.

Having sent samples off for analysis and the bodies for post mortems to labs and research institutes in Italy and the United Kingdom, IHP then stopped all their horses from leaving a controlled area of 2 shed buildings and a small paddock. Obviously this is tough on the horses since it causes them additional stress and anxiety, as well as for the staff and volunteers who are now caring for the sectioned equines around the clock.

Although IHP have engaged specialist veterinarians to rule out foul play, sabotage or such like behavior, the Italian Horse Protection Onlus (Onlus means Association in Italian) are also desperate to rule out accidental death due to soil contamination, field water pollution or poisonous plants growing on the land. All 600 acres of it, a huge, daunting and expensive task.

With an intensive investigation underway, the horses in quarantine, and 24 hour vigilance in effect by IHP staff and volunteers, it is causing the non-profit to strain its finances on top of its cost of moving.

If you have ever come across something like this and/or could offer any kind of suggestion that the Italian Horse Protection could look out for or investigate, please contact IHP (live links are in the footnote of the source URL).

[3] 1st update

Founder Sonny Richichi, ensured toxicology tests were carried out, veterinarian tests were executed, post mortems were underway, soil sampling was done, field water was tested and more, but none have delivered any answers to the mysterious deaths.

The medical report of the post mortem carried out on the 9th horse, which died on 21 Feb 2019, was released on 18 Mar 2019, one and a half months following the 8 other deaths occurring between 31 Dec [2018(?)] and 3 Jan [2019]. The investigations carried out by the Pisa Istituto Zooprofilattico Lazio & Toscana did not reveal any precise cause of death, though did note abnormal lesions in the trachea and bronchial passages, and some heart lesions, but nothing which could directly indicate the cause of such a sudden death. Numerous toxic substances were tested, as well as bacterial and viral infections, plus analysis of hay, but again, all proved negative.

This means many potential causes have been eliminated without throwing any light on the actual cause of death. (Unfortunately what was ruled out was not conveyed in this report. - Mod.TG)

The Pisa laboratory is currently carrying out a series of tests on the samples from the 8 horses that died in close succession, hoping to identify something of a cause. These samples, initially frozen and held by the University of Bologna and the Istituto Zooprofilattico of Bologna (where the necropies were carried out) will now be sent to Pisa. This move was agreed at a meeting of the Director of the Unita Operativa Sanita Animale, ASL Toscana Nordovest, the Director of the Ministry of Health Animal Welfare Office, the Regione Toscana 'allevamenti e igiene urbana veterinaria' and the Direttore Sanitario of the Istituto Zooprofilattico Lazio and Toscana. During the meeting, other decisions were made, in particular, it was considered both necessary and urgent to alert ARPAT (Agenzia Regionale Per La Protezone Ambientale Della Toscana) in order to ascertain the presence or otherwise of contamination; in addition a more detailed gathering and coordinating of data was requested, including data from other tests, analyses and blood samples from 25 horses, together with hay, feed and water samples.

To date [29 Mar 2019] nothing is known about the analyses of selenium and vitamin E levels, nothing is yet known about the analysis of the water available to the horses, and there is no news regarding any findings from ARPAT which monitors the state of the environment; carries out checks on the sources of pollution and the resulting impacts, dealing with the identification and prevention of risk factors for environmental and human health.

"This is an unacceptable situation,'' commented Sonny Richichi, President of IHP. "It leaves us both perplexed and bewildered, especially when we read in the local press that the authorities are thinking of closing the investigation. For this reason we have decided in addition to writing the ninth (?) request for information to the local health authorities, we have decided to present a detailed complaint to the Pisa Prosecutor's office (who have already opened a file on this case of the mysterious death of the horses) detailing the facts of this affair, reconstructing step by step what has been witnessed by many who were physically present, or who have furnished us with relevant information. We can never accept that the death of 8 horses, whose demise has been cleared of any deliberate poisoning by the authorities themselves, should be dismissed without explanation. Not least because this situation is damaging the Association, which has been obliged for over 2 months to set up a crisis management of the horses, difficult for the staff and the animals, given we are afraid to let them out into the pastures or to drink the water. This situation is draining all our resources, with heavy consequences for the association. Our work is to report mistreatment, investigate illegal goings-on which exploit horses, to rescue equids who are suffering appalling conditions - work which IHP has been carrying out for over 10 years in all of Italy. We are now seriously limited by not knowing what has killed our horses, and could kill more. We are waiting for concrete answers."

Do you think you can offer any answers or suggestions that the Italian Horse Protection could look into for their investigation? If you can, please contact IHP (live links are in the footnote of the source URL). You can drop an email to<ihp@horseprotection>.

[4] 2nd update:
Date: 16 Nov 2019

Founder and president of IHP, Sonny Richichi, is in the midst of despair and for good reason. The tests, examinations and reports which are having to be carried out are at a cost to IHP. But with no results, IHP has to continue quarantining their equines and go on requesting more examination with no understandable place of where or what to concentrate on.

The cost now is to the extent IHP is evaluating the possibility of closing their Rescue Centre in Tignano, which is the only registered horse protection charity / association in Italy.

We can't bear to see that happen so Charity Needs Foundation (CNF) is asking the public, once again, if they know someone who is a professional in the areas of agriculture, particularly in soil testing, or whom have an understanding of plants, grasses or living organisms (Botanists, Biologists and such like); anyone knowing about equine toxicology (even knowledge of bovine toxicology may highlight some clues or answers); those knowing about water borne disease (Geologists perhaps); Veterinarians; Pathologists; feed analysts or the like.

We're basically seeking out experts or professionals anywhere in the world who can apply their talents to solving this ongoing mystery by analyzing the reports and samples that remain. The reports can be shared with qualifying experts in the hope it might prompt a missing thought process or ultimately find a concrete, conclusive result.

Part of the reason IHP is in the jaws of closure is the lack of responses from competent authorities such as the Ministry of Health who Sonny places at the top of his list saying, "we have been asking for months for an operational protocol allowing immediate investigations to establish the causes of deaths and the creation of a communication network among experienced toxicologists. These are formal requests the association will renew with great determination, while at the same time a new complaint will be made to the Public Prosecutor's Office, since this massacre of horses remains a mystery which unfortunately does not exclude the hypothesis of intent, given the results of the post-mortem examinations."

Says Sonny, "Again we suppose the problem could be with the pasture. We've been told to keep the horses in confined spaces and far away from the grass, but have not been given any convincing and documented explanations. Indeed, at the end of April [2019] and again at the beginning of October [2019], during 2 meetings with ASL (Azienda Sanitaria Locale, or in English, Local Health Authority) and IZSLT (Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale del Lazio, or in English, Experimental Zooprophylactic Institute of Lazio) they told us the pastures were safe".

With the reassurance of having been told the pastures were safe, on the 9 May 2019, IHP began to let their animals back out into the fields, but very slowly over a 4 week period starting with an hour a day, then 2, then 3 and so on until they were allowed out all day and some even overnight. During this whole release period no abnormalities were recorded in the health status of the animals which was being performed after having had tests on both soil and water.

Chemical tests on the water were performed for parameters such as pH, turbidity, conductivity, color, smell, flavor, tot, hardness (° f), football, magnesium, sodium, potassium, iron, manganese, aluminum, copper, nitrates, nitrite, chloride, sulfates, phosphates, ammonia, free active chlorine, hydrogen sulphide, counting of colonies at 22 ° C, counting of colonies at 36 ° C, counts total coliforms, count _Escherichia coli_, count Intestinal _Enterococci_, count _Clostridium perfringens_ (including spores) and count _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_.

And chemical tests on the soil were performed for such substances as, cyanides (none of which was found), arsenic, beryllium, cadmium, cobalt, total chrome, chrome vi, mercury, nickel, lead, copper, selenium, thallium and vanadium.

It is the lack of answers, however, and contradictory indications have led IHP to consider stopping the activities of their Rescue Centre having suffered this last wave of deaths from October 2019.

Sonny went on to explain, "A new emergency management of horses, the same as the one undertaken between January and April [2019], would expose the association to financial collapse and to a risk of injury for horses and staff, and the unlikely event of moving elsewhere would be even worse."

Asking for funds is not something CNF is focusing on here as we can't guarantee how much will need to be spent on endless examinations and tests without knowing an end result can be achieved fairly quickly, but we can't get away from the fact that IHP need financial support too, so if you are happy to support IHP in the continuation of these examinations, tests and quarantining, then please do give what you can, use the button below [on their website listed in the Source, above. - Mod.TG] to donate directly to IHP as IHP's reserves have been depleted.

Getting the voluntary professional services of specialists who may be able to provide answers to this ongoing crisis would go a long way to helping the charity survive the extremely upsetting spend they are having to endure and nightmare they've been living through for over 10 months.

This situation must not be isolated to IHP, all eyes from the rest of the equine world should be focused on what is going on here, this could be an elaborate act of sabbage whereby the saboteurs have cleverly introduced something so lethal it kills within minutes and leaves no trace. Sounds ridiculous doesn't it, like something out of a spy movie and totally unbelievable. The mere mention of it feels like it shouldn't even be on the page, but although this is just pure speculation, the reality is staring us in the face -- it could happen -- IHP's story has no answers and no conclusion from tests carried out by leading authorities, universities, officials and other experts, which in itself gives substance to this scenario. Let it be known that the results of the first four deaths stated that no cause of death came from a viral or bacterial origin and that the cause could be the probable action of a toxin.

You can use your imagination to think what kind of manipulations and shenanigans could follow from unscrupulous persons if this is something that could be gotten away with, therefore It is why foul play cannot be ruled out. [But over 600 acres? Or is this targeting a pasture where horses are? - Mod.TG]

After the first 3 or 4 deaths, even IHP's resident vet, Dr. Agnese Santi, raised concerns intentional poisoning could at play. It is also why CNF are asking the public who own or look after horses to report to CNF anything they may have suffered in the past that seems anywhere near similar to this case. Again, such information may prompt a thought process that has been missed or it may reap a conclusion.

It is likely to take the dedicated talents of some of the worlds finest experts to solve this mystery, and IHP needs such good characters to come forward offering their professional services for nothing more than the glorification they or their team will receive in the concluding article we want to see them written into.

Sonny Richichi is not placing any reliance on the authorities already contacted by IHP as there have been far too many hitches, mistakes, delays and other incompetences to glean confidence from. For example, on [18 Feb 2019] the first coordinated meeting was convened at ASL of Volterra to take stock of the situation. Representatives of ASL of Volterra, the Commander of the Carabinieri Forestal station of Volterra (they're a bit like the Forestry Commission in the UK, but in Police form) were present, as were officials of the Investigative Unit of the Carabinieri of Pisa (one of Italy's main law enforcement agencies) and Sonny Richichi himself. In that meeting, Sonny learned to his dismay, that none of those present, all of whom were supposed to have received reports of the necropsies already issued some weeks prior from the laboratories in Bologna where the reports were generated, had not seen them. Nor did they receive news or information from veterinarians in charge of the exams. It was Sonny himself, during the meeting, that provided the evidence, news, reports and other information by downloading files from his mobile phone to have them printed from an ASL computer. As a result, no substantial element emerged from the meeting concerning the investigations on the death of horses, leaving open the hypothesis of food poisoning (or contaminants in the soil) and that of malicious poisoning.

There are 3 possible outcomes to this story, 1) is it is a genuine mystery which hopefully will get solved. 2) Is there's a toxin to blame and will be proved. 3) Is a dangerous 'C word' -- 'Conspiracy', because this story is getting far too elaborate to play out as just 'one-of-those-things'.

Hazel is the trustee at CNF which first brought forward the story of the Italian Horse Protection Association in her article Neglect of Italian Horses (Google it) before their move and the dilemma they are now in. It will be Hazel who shall be concluding the story when we get that elusive answer that the world is waiting for, much less IHP.

[Unfortunately, it seems the charity is not entirely being taken seriously. Perhaps because they are a charity and depend on monetary donations to fund the necessary testing needed.

It seems with no report of what the selenium and vitamin E levels are, this might be helpful to know this. It would also be helpful to know the type of soils and the local flora of the area. It is difficult to speculate without knowing what is on the over 600 acres.

There are excellent maps on their websites with more details of the location of the deaths and a bit more information regarding the flora of the area.

I am greatly sympathetic to their plight and to the demise of the animals. This takes a heavy toll on the individuals offering care to these animals.

Hopefully this posting will help make connections for the IHP and veterinarians, toxicologist and specialist who can assist the IHP. - Mod.TG
