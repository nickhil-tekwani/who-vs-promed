CORAL REEF KILLS, ETIOLOGY DETERMINED - USA

Scientists announced in Nature Magazine on 10 April that the unprecedented
kill of corals along a stretch of Florida's southeast coast (from Dania
Beach to Key West) since 1995 is due to a newly discovered species of the
bacterium _Sphingomonas_. The pathogen bleaches the corals in the process
of killing them.
