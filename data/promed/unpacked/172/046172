The Suffolk County Department of Health Services reported that
terrestrial animal rabies has been confirmed in a raccoon found on
Camel Hollow Beach, Lloyd Harbor, Suffolk County on 25 Apr 2007.
There was no known human or animal contact with the raccoon. The
Suffolk County Department of Health Services submitted the specimen
to the New York State Department of Health Rabies Laboratory where
the rabies virus was confirmed.
This is Suffolk County's 12th case of terrestrial animal rabies since
March of last year [2006] and the 7th of this calendar year. To date,
rabid raccoons have been recovered from Huntington (2), Lloyd Harbor
(9), and Cold Spring Harbor (1).
Rabies is a viral disease that is transmitted from infected mammals
to humans. Left untreated, it will invariably lead to death. Early
symptoms include irritability, headache, fever, and sometimes itching
at the site of exposure. Within days, the disease progresses to
paralysis, spasms of the throat muscles, convulsions, delirium and death.
People can get rabies if they are exposed to the saliva or nervous
tissue of a rabid animal through a bite. It is also possible,
although rare, that people can get rabies if infectious material,
such as saliva, from a rabid animal gets directly into their eyes,
nose, mouth or a wound.
Since the advent of raccoon rabies in Nassau County, Suffolk County
has been working with federal, state, county and local officials to
develop a plan for the control of the disease. In September of last
year [2006], the Suffolk County Department of Health Services began
an oral rabies vaccine program in the western region of the county.
This was complemented by similar efforts in Nassau County. A 2nd
phase of the program is planned for late spring. The goal of this
program is to vaccinate terrestrial wildlife against rabies in order
to prevent further spread on Long Island.
Dr. Humayun Chaudhry, Commissioner of the Suffolk County Department
of Health Services, said: "While I am very concerned about the spread
of terrestrial rabies into Suffolk County, I want to assure Suffolk
residents that the County, in cooperation with the United States
Department of Agriculture and the New York State Department of
Health, is doing everything possible to stop the spread of
terrestrial rabies in the County."
It should be emphasized that this was not a human case and that there
is no immediate need for alarm. However, it is recommended that
Suffolk County residents take the appropriate precautions as follows:
New York State and Suffolk County law requires that all dogs, cats
and ferrets be vaccinated against rabies. Vaccinating your pet not
only provides protection for the animal, but vaccinated pets act as a
barrier to keep the rabies virus from spreading between wild animals
and people. It is very important to make sure that these animals, as
well as livestock and horses, have current rabies vaccinations.
To further protect yourself from possible exposure to rabies:
- Keep dogs, cats and ferrets on a leash, and keep livestock confined
in the evening.
- Do not have contact with any animal other than your own.
- Do not feed wildlife or stray animals, and discourage them from
seeking food near your home.
- Do not touch dead or dying animals. Use a shovel, wear rubber
gloves and double bag the carcass, if you need to move it.
- Do not approach an unknown animal, either wild or domestic,
especially if it is acting in an unusual way.
- Keep garbage cans tightly covered, and avoid storing any food outside.
- Children should be advised to tell an adult immediately if they are
bitten or scratched by any animal.
To prevent the possible spread of the rabies virus, no one, including
trappers and nuisance wildlife rehabilitators should transport and
relocate any wild animals at this time.
The public is asked to report sightings of abnormally-acting
raccoons, skunks and foxes to the Suffolk County Police Department by
calling (631) 852-COPS.
Sightings of dead raccoons, skunks and foxes in the Town of
Huntington only should be reported to the Suffolk County Department
of Health Services by calling (631) 853-8405, Monday through Friday,
between the hours of 10:00 AM and 4:00 PM.

[12 raccoons with rabies in one county in a year or less is rather
substantial. Raccoons can come into contact with horses, livestock
and pets. The recommendation to make sure these animals are
vaccinated cannot be emphasized enough.
Suffolk County primarily comprises the eastern 2/3rds of Long Island,
NY. A map may be found at
