RVF-hit sheep to be killed
--------------------------
Saudi authorities have decided to destroy more than 300 head of smuggled
sheep in the southern Jizan region after they showed symptoms of deadly
Rift Valley fever. The move comes as part of the government's efforts to
rid the kingdom of the disease, which caused the death of more than 120
people and 18 000 cattle when it hit the Jizan region 4 years ago. [The
figures on cattle need substantiation. RVF usually affects sheep more than
cattle. - Mod.AS]
Agriculture minister Dr Fahd Balghaneim said the sheep culled for slaughter
were smuggled into the kingdom from neighboring Yemen. "We have returned
the herd to Al-Tiwal border post and they are now kept in a special
quarantine," he said. The Ministry of Agriculture announced about 10 days
ago that 5 animals in Jizan -- 4 in Abu Areesh and 1 in Aaridah -- had
tested positive for the disease.
The Health Ministry has confirmed that no RVF cases have so far been
reported among humans in the Jizan region. "We have inspected all patients
admitted to King Fahd Hospital in Jizan and the General Hospital in
Aaridha. We did not find any suspected RVF cases among them," said Dr Tariq
ibn Ahmed Madani, an internist and adviser to health minister Dr Hamad
Al-Manie. Madani was a member of the ministry's team who recently visited
the region on the instructions of Al-Manie following reports of fresh
outbreaks of the virus in Jizan.
Dr Yaaqub Al-Mazroue, assistant deputy health minister for preventive
medicine, also visited Jizan and inspected the arrangements made by the
Health Ministry to prevent the spread of the disease as well as the
progress of work at disease combat centers. Madani said his team checked
all the files of patients admitted at Jizan hospitals for the past 3 months
to make sure they were not infected with RVF virus. The team also visited
the laboratory of the Agriculture Ministry and met with veterinarians and
other experts there as well as the areas where the 5 cases were reported.
Balghuneim urged the authorities to be cautious about the RVF virus, which
is capable of surviving in the eggs of mosquitoes for a long time and can
surface whenever it finds a hospitable environment. The Agriculture
Ministry has set up an early warning unit to monitor and contain infectious
diseases affecting agricultural and animal resources in certain regions
before they spread to other parts of the Kingdom.
RVF primarily affects animals but occasionally causes illness in humans,
where it leads to high morbidity and mortality.

[It will be interesting to obtain information on the alleged "symptoms of
RVF" shown by the smuggled sheep. We also await more details on the
laboratory investigations which were earlier used in the 5 animals in Jizan
which "tested positive for the disease". As rightly remarked recently by Dr
CJ Peters (see 20040912.2538), recognition of transmission of RVF depends
strongly on good surveillance and laboratory testing; in particular,
whether the detected antibodies were IgM antibodies and whether there are
virus isolations.
Is any RVF surveillance (possibly sponsored by international organisations
such as FAO, WHO, EU) carried out in Yemen? - Mod.AS]
