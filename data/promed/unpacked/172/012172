CFIA statement on porcine epidemic diarrhea virus in feed
---------------------------------------------------------
The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) is conducting science-based testing to determine if feed may be a contributing factor in the current porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDv) situation.

PEDv poses no risk to human health or food safety.

Proper biosecurity measures remain the 1st and best line of defense for pork producers to protect against PED.

As a precautionary measure, on 9 Feb 2014, Grand Valley Fortifiers issued a voluntary recall for certain pelleted swine nursery feed products containing porcine plasma.

Testing has determined that PED virus was present in samples of US-origin plasma obtained at the 3rd-party manufacturer for Grand Valley Fortifiers. This plasma was used as an ingredient in feed pellets produced by the company. Testing with a swine bioassay has determined that the plasma ingredient contains PED virus capable of causing disease in pigs.

Further testing will be done to assess if the feed pellets are capable of causing disease in piglets, and results are expected within days. Testing will continue to confirm a direct link between the feed and the spread of the disease, as the virus is only confirmed in a single ingredient at this time.

The CFIA is working closely with the company to confirm the effectiveness of the recall, and is closely examining company records to see where potentially affected product was distributed.

The CFIA is also reviewing records of other imports of swine plasma and will work with the Council of Chief Veterinary Officers and the pork industry in Canada to proactively manage the possible risk of transmission through feed.

As the investigation continues, additional actions such as recalls may be necessary to minimize the potential that feed could contribute to the transmission of this disease in Canada.

[Porcine plasma contaminated with PEDv, then made into feed and fed to swine. Sounds amazing like the start of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) or mad cow disease. Remember? Ground up cow parts were fed back to cattle to increase protein and to recycle the animal and reduce waste of an animal, It took years for the disease to manifest itself to a rate that caused alarm.

While this incident may not be the same, the question of this being a common practice, and now having reached a level of alarm certainly crosses my mind.
