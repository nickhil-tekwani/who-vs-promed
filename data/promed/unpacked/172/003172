Italy reported 7 new cases of anthrax in livestock since last week
[week of 26 Sep 2011] as the deadly animal disease spreads in the
country's south, bringing affected farms to 26 since the 1st
confirmation in September 2011.

The illness killed cattle, sheep, and horses or donkeys on 7 farms
across 4 towns southeast of Naples, Italy's Ministry of Health said in
an alert today [6 Oct 2011] published online by the Paris-based World
Organization of Animal Health, or OIE. One of the towns had no
previous occurrence.

Animals died on 4 farms in Pietrapertosa as well as on farms in
Corleto Perticara, and Padula, adding to previously reported cases,
according to the alert. Italy also found anthrax in Laurenzana, the
1st case there, it showed.

The outbreak continues, and measures to fight the disease include
animal-movement controls and disinfection of infected farms, the
animal-health group said. Livestock is not being vaccinated, the OIE
said.

Italy: anthrax outbreaks in 2011
--------------------------------
23 outbreaks have been reported in Campania (7 outbreaks in Salerno)
and Basilicatta (3 outbreaks in Materra and 13 in Potenza).

Control measures, as provided by current national rules (D.P.R. n
54/320), have been adopted: demarcation of infection zone (3 km [2 mi]
radius); restrictions of animal movements; destruction of dead animals
and vaccination of all susceptible animals. Outbreaks have been
officially notified to OIE (with the exception of those confirmed last
week).

The NRL [national livestock service] is looking, together with the
local competent authorities, on the origin of the outbreaks and
extending the control measures in place on those areas (such as
extension of the vaccination period). In the coming days further
information will be made available.

[Our thanks to Vincent for the EU/Italian link. Most helpful. This
report is replete with detailed maps and data.

We can expect this series of outbreaks to continue until the
vaccination or the cold autumn weather kicks in; whichever comes
first. - Mod.MHJ]
