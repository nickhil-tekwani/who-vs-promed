A dog in Preston [England] has died after contracting the Alabama rot disease. Understood to be from the Fulwood area of the city, the dog died on Monday [8 Feb 2016] at a vets in Preston. Anderson Moores Veterinary Specialists posted on their Facebook page the update regarding the latest case of the disease. They say it is the 65th confirmed case of the disease since 2012. The disease causes a failure of the kidneys.

Friends of the family who had the dog say it was walked regularly in Highgate Woods off Garstang Road. It is not known at this stage which breed of dog has died. What is Alabama rot? It is known as cutaneous and renal glomerular vasculopathy and symptoms include wounds on legs, paws and faces. Dogs develop clinical signs of kidney failure which can include vomiting, reduced appetite and tiredness.

The disease was 1st identified in the United States in the 1980s.

Similar cases in dogs from various locations in England, some of them referred to as the "New Forest disease," have been addressed by ProMED-mail in several postings since September 2011, referred to as "undiagnosed." In April 2015, a team of 9 authors, consisting of 6 British and 3 Americans, have published the results of their common investigations (Ref 1), leading them to believe that the disease is Alabama rot (cutaneous and renal glomerular vasculopathy), a condition which has been seen in the USA in greyhounds for almost 30 years. While there have been occasional reports of the disease in individual dogs outside of the USA, this is the 1st report of a series of cases occurring in England. None of the 30 dogs in this English series of cases were greyhounds and evidence of the disease was found in 15 different breeds of dog.

The paper includes information on dogs that had presented at 53 English veterinary practices between 1 Nov 2012 and 31 Mar 2014 with skin lesions, acute kidney injury of no identifiable cause and histopathology showing evidence of blood clots in the small vessels of the kidney (renal thrombotic microangiopathy). Cases were identified both from searches of the practice records and the memories of vets working at the practices.

A total of 71 possible cases occurred during the study period, but 41 were excluded due to limited investigations or because medical records were incomplete.

The 30 dogs that met all 3 criteria fell into a variety of breeds: English springer spaniel (5 dogs), crossbreed above 20 kg (4 dogs), flat coated retriever (4 dogs), whippet (3 dogs), border collie (2 dogs), Jack Russell terrier (2 dogs), Doberman (2 dogs), and one each of Labrador retriever, cocker spaniel, Staffordshire bull terrier, Hungarian vizsla, Weimaraner, Dalmatian, Tibetan terrier and crossbreed below 20 kg.

The dogs were located in multiple areas of northern and southern England (the biggest cluster in the New Forest National Park), visiting woodlands shortly (4 hours to 14 days) before developing skin lesions and/or becoming unwell.

Most of the dogs had been taken to the vet by their owners because of skin lesions. Some dogs were already unwell, but in others systemic clinical signs (tiredness, loss of appetite, vomiting and fever) generally developed a few days later. No evidence of _E. coli_ Shiga toxin, which can cause sudden onset kidney damage in humans as part of a disease called haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS), was found in the kidneys or faeces of affected dogs. 24 the 30 dogs died or were put to sleep because of the disease, and 6 were put to sleep at their owner's request.

Acute kidney injury in these dogs was caused by damage to the small blood vessels of the kidney (renal thrombotic microangiopathy). In their discussion the authors indicate that renal thrombotic microangiopathy is relatively rare; the pathology is also found in another rare disorder affecting dogs and humans -- haemolytic uraemic syndrome -- which results in acute kidney injury and anaemia, but which is not associated with skin lesions.

The authors say that it is unclear whether canine haemolytic uraemic syndrome and cutaneous and renal glomerular vasculopathy [Alabama rot] are 2 distinct diseases. They conclude that continued detailed clinical, pathological and epidemiological evaluation will improve understanding of the disease and help to identify possible triggers and the best management options. Currently it is unclear whether this is an emerging disease or one that was previously present but unrecognised. The etiology remains to be unravelled.
