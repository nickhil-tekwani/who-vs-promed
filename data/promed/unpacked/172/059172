Disease outbreak news - Meningococcal disease - Niger (update)
-----------------
Between 1 Jan and 28 Jun 2015, the Ministry of Public Health of Niger notified WHO of 8500 suspected cases of meningococcal meningitis, including 573 deaths. This was the largest meningitis outbreak caused by _Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroup C in the African meningitis belt.

The number of suspected cases increased very rapidly, tripling weekly between 1 and 15 May 2015. 13 districts in Niger crossed the epidemic threshold. The 5 districts of Niamey, Niger's capital and largest city, reported 5267 suspected cases and 260 deaths.

The outbreak peaked between 4 and 10 May 2015 when 2182 cases, including 132 deaths, were reported. Since then, the outbreak declined substantially -- from 22 to 28 Jun, a total of 11 cases, including 2 deaths, were reported.

Laboratory tests confirmed the predominance of _Neisseria meningitidis_ (Nm) serogroup C in the affected areas, with Nm serogroup W also being identified in 12 percent of positive samples. Although serogroup C has been the predominant cause of meningitis in wealthy countries, it has never been of high concern in Africa.

An epidemic committee was activated to manage the outbreak at all levels of the country. An international team comprising experts from WHO and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) was deployed to support the Ministry of Public Health in carrying out epidemiological investigations and strengthening the national surveillance capacity.

Together with its partners, WHO assisted the government of Niger in the implementation of mass vaccination campaigns and other emergency control measures. The International Coordinating Group (ICG) on Vaccine Provision for Epidemic Meningitis Control approved 4 vaccination requests and released 965 000 doses of multivalent C and W containing polysaccharide vaccine and 200 000 doses of ACYW conjugate vaccine. Furthermore, the government of Niger obtained 200 000 doses of polysaccharide ACWY vaccine from the government of Mali.

In addition to mass immunization campaigns and enhanced surveillance, social mobilization and case management activities were performed in all affected areas. These measures led to the control of the outbreak. Currently, all districts are below the epidemic threshold.

[Serogroup A meningococcus had been the main cause of epidemic meningococcal disease in the African meningitis belt, which includes Niger (http://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/meningitis/whoemcbac983.pdf; see map at
http://www.cdc.gov/travel-static/yellowbook/2014/map_3-11.pdf).
However, the epidemiology of meningococcal meningitis in the African meningitis belt has changed after preventive vaccination with conjugate meningitis A vaccine -- MenAfrivac (R) -- was introduced in 2010.

Immunity following use of a meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine is serogroup-specific with no cross-protection against infection due to other meningococcal polysaccharide groups. Consequently, serogroup A meningococcal meningitis outbreaks have not been reported in countries like Niger where preventive vaccination with the conjugate meningitis A vaccine has been undertaken. Serogroups like C and W have now emerged as the common causes of outbreaks in the belt as seen in the current outbreak in Niger.

The current outbreak highlights the need for enhanced surveillance of meningococcal meningitis in the African meningitis belt and linking the findings to better preparedness and response to prevent large-scale outbreaks like the current one.
