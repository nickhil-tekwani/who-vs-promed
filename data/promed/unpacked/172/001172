-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Given that these children who died of RMSF spent a lot of time with their dogs, possibly slept near them, and that dogs in Mexico are often allowed free range to roam their neighborhoods and associate with other neighborhood dogs, it is also likely that a low proportion of the "street" dogs in Mexico are treated for ticks. This is how the brown dog tick (_Rhipicephalus sanguineus_) population spreads around from dog to dog; thus, it seems quite likely that these cases of RMSF were transmitted by brown dog ticks. These ticks live on dogs and in the houses or structures that their dog hosts live in, and the people who spend the most time in the same parts of the home where the dogs sleep are most likely to be fed upon by brown dog ticks.

There have been several large RMSF outbreaks in Mexico over the past 60 years, as well as large outbreaks of RMSF on American Indian reservations where dogs are also allowed to roam freely and are not frequently treated to control ticks.
