The Health Ministry has identified the diplococci bacteria [presumably
_Neisseria meningitidis_] as the cause of the meningitis afflicting
trainees of the Road Transport Department (JPJ) Academy in Tiang Dua,
[Malacca], resulting in one death last week [week of 4 May 2009].

Health minister Datuk Seri Liow Tiong Lai said that until 2 pm today [10
May 2009], 20 trainees were warded at [Malacca] Hospital, 2 in the
intensive care unit and 18 at the isolation ward. He said 6 new patients
were warded at the same hospital yesterday evening [9 May 2009] and one
today. "However, we believe the bacterial infection can be controlled with
the preventive and rehabilitative measures taken by Malacca Hospital," he
said after visiting the patients at the hospital, today. Also present was
Malacca Health director Dr Ghazali Othman.

Liow said the 93 JPJ Academy trainees quarantined were being closely
observed by a 7 member special task force headed by a doctor for immediate
measures to be taken in an emergency. He said the trainees quarantined had
been given ciprofloxacin, an antibiotic while those being treated at the
hospital were given ceftriaxone to recover from the infection. "I saw that
the patients at the ICU and isolation ward were okay. The antibiotics given
seemed to be working and they (patients) would need 7 days of treatment
before the next step."

He said residents, especially in Tiang Dua, should not panic over the
meningitis situation as the infection could only be spread by droplets when
the carrier coughed or sneezed within a one-metre range. "The meningitis
bacteria will not cause an uncontrollable epidemic," he assured. Liow said
samples of the diplococci bacteria had been sent to the microbiology
laboratory in Sungai Buloh to ascertain the type as the bacteria had
different strains.

"We are also investigating the source of the bacteria by obtaining samples
from where the trainees had their practical training, namely in Pedas
(Negeri Sembilan), Muar (Johor), and Bukit Katil (Malacca)." He said all
trainees and staff of the JPJ Academy in Tiang Dua were given antibiotics
to control the spread of the meningitis bacterial infection.

The Health Ministry has given an assurance that the diplococci meningitis
outbreak in [Malacca] is under control. The infection was contained within
the Road Transport Department training academy and would not be a threat to
the country, said health minister Datuk Seri Liow Tiong Lai.

On [4 May 2009], a trainee at the academy in Tiang Dua, Malacca, died of
the infection while being rushed to hospital. Liow said the outbreak was
investigated as soon as possible and it was then discovered that it was not
a viral infection. This enabled the ministry to give the right medication
to the patients.

As of yesterday [11 May 2009], there were 32 patients hospitalised with 2
in intensive care and 29 in the isolation ward in Malacca and another
patient in Kepala Batas, Penang. The number of trainees in the isolation
ward increased from 18 from the day before [10 May 2009], he said. "They
are all in stable condition," said Liow, adding that they were being put on
treatment and each treatment cycle takes one week.

The ministry would know in a day or 2 the subtype of the diplococci
bacteria that infected the trainees, said Liow. Water samples were taken
from 3 training places in Negeri Sembilan, Johor, and Malacca, and from a
pond in Pedas, Negeri Sembilan, where some of them had swum in, he said.
Liow also said that the infection was spread through droplets and people
are advised to close their mouths when they cough or sneeze.

At present, there are 89 people who are still quarantined. Another 234
trainees returned to their hostels but were not allowed to leave the academy.

Meanwhile Bernama [Malaysian National News Agency] quoted Kelantan Health
Department director Dr Lila Mohamed Meeran as saying that the outbreak of
meningitis did not originate from the East Coast state [Kelantan]. She said
[the patient] was down with fever and brain membrane infection a day before
he returned to Kota Baru for a holiday on 1 May 2009.

The number of people hospitalised with suspected meningitis in Malacca
Hospital rose to 38 on Tuesday [12 May 2009], from 31 the day before. This
brings the number hospitalised nationwide to 39 including one Road
Transport Department (JPJ) academy trainee hospitalised in Kepala Batas
[Penang] who is in stable condition.

Health minister Datuk Seri Liow Tiong Lai said 4 of the new patients who
developed symptoms were trainees who had been quarantined at the academy
hostel in Tiang Dua, Malacca. Two more are radiographers, while another is
the fiancee of one of the trainees, he said, adding that all of them were
in the isolation ward while the 2 trainees in intensive care unit were now
able to walk.

"The source of infection has not been discovered and we are working hard to
find the carrier," he said yesterday [12 May 2009] after the International
Nurses' Day celebration.

[Although not specified in the news reports, the cause of the outbreak of
meningitis in Malaysia is presumably _N. meningitidis_. ProMED-mail has
recently reported on outbreaks of presumably meningococcal meningitis in
Myanmar and confirmed meningococcal meningitis in Northeastern India and
Bangladesh, an area that borders western Myanmar.

The following has been extracted from Mod.ML's comments in ProMED-mail post
archive number 20090218.0674:

Most cases meningococcal meningitis are sporadic; outbreaks tend to occur
in semi-closed communities, such military recruit camps, college
dormitories (as in the trainee hostel of the Malaysian Transport Department
(JPJ) academy in Malacca above), schools, and day-care centers.

Although the incidence of meningococcal disease in general is highest in
children less than 2 years of age
(<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5407a1.htm> [updated at
<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5631a3.htm>]), more cases arise
among the 5 to 19 year old group during outbreaks than during non-outbreaks.

Currently, serogroups B, C, and Y cause the majority of infections in the
USA; serogroup A is rare in the USA, and W135 causes a very small
proportion of infections; serogroup B is the most common serogroup in
infants, while serogroup Y causes the majority of cases in those aged 65
years and older
(<http://www.nfid.org/pdf/meningitis/FINALChanging_Epidemiology_of_Meningococcal_Disease.pdf>).
Serogroup A was identified as the cause of meningococcal disease in
Northeastern India (see ProMED-mail post Meningitis, meningococcal - India
(05): (NE, DL) 20090217.0667).

An outbreak of meningococcal disease is defined as the occurrence of 3 or
more confirmed or probable cases during a period of less than or equal to 3
months, resulting in a primary disease attack rate of at least 10 cases per
100 000 persons, which is about 10 times greater than the normal occurrence
(<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00046237.htm>).

Chemoprophylaxis is given to appropriate contacts whose risk for acquiring
meningococcal disease is 500-800 times greater than among the total
population (<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00046237.htm>). Close
contacts of patients are household members, day-care center contacts, and
persons directly exposed to the patient's oral secretions. Administering
chemoprophylaxis to persons who are not close contacts of patients usually
is not recommended. Neither oropharyngeal nor nasopharyngeal cultures for
_N. meningitidis_ are useful in deciding who should receive chemoprophylaxis.

In an outbreak, the population at risk should be vaccinated with the
meningococcal vaccine appropriate for the serogroup causing the outbreak as
soon as possible after an outbreak has been declared
(<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00046237.htm>).

How one case in Penang on the northwestern coast of Malaysia relates to the
other cases in Malacca on the southwestern coast is not explained.
Confirmation of the identity of the pathogen involved in the Malaysian
bacterial meningitis outbreak would be appreciated. DNA fingerprinting of
the isolates would help in epidemiologic linkage. - Mod.ML
