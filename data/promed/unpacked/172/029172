Due to the recent finding of carbapenemases of New Delhi
metallo-beta-lactamase (NDM) type in isolations of _Klebsiella
pneumoniae_ in Guatemala, the Pan American Health Organization/World
Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) emphasizes the importance of the
surveillance and detection in the region of this resistance mechanism
that increases morbidity and mortality of healthcare associated
infections.

In August 2010, reports indicated the emergence of a mechanism of
resistance in Enterobacteriaceae that caused outbreaks and was related
to an increase in morbidity and hospital mortality in India, Pakistan,
and England. Subsequently, it was also reported in Europe, Japan,
Australia, Canada, and the USA. Due to its geographical origin, the
mechanism was named "New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase" (NDM).

In Latin America, the circulation of metallo-beta-lactamase of type
VIM [Verona integron-encoded] had been reported mainly in non
fermenting Gram negative bacilli, as _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_,
_Acinetobacter baumanni_, and to a smaller degree in
Enterobacteriaceae; however, NDM had not been detected. NDM type
metallo-beta-lactamase have spread to different countries via the
related Enterobacteriaceae as _K. pneumoniae_, an agent commonly
related to hospital infections.

Since 2008, when the 1st case was detected in a patient in Sweden that
had traveled to India, there have been reports of dissemination of
this mechanism and its circulation in other countries. In 2010, Canada
and the USA detected cases in travelers coming from India. In Latin
America, there had not been reports of the circulation of this
mechanism, until Guatemala recently reported 2 isolations of _K.
pneumoniae_.

On 17 Nov 2011, the International Health Regulations National Focal
Point (IHR NFP) published an epidemiological alert of the isolation of
strains of multiresistant _K. pneumoniae_ by carbapenemase type New
Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase (NDM) in Guatemala. According to the
published alert, the National Health Laboratory confirmed the presence
of NDM in 2 strains of _K. pneumoniae_ that were provided by 2
national reference hospitals located in Guatemala City. The Guatemala
IHR NFP is conducting epidemiological research to know the origin and
the implications of the finding. The National Institute of Infectious
Diseases Dr Carlos G Malbran in Argentina carried out the molecular
analysis of the strains. Additional molecular analyses are underway to
determine the type of NDM and the pulsed field gel electrophoresis,
which in turn will help to find the genetic relation of these strains
with those circulating elsewhere in the world.

Surveillance in Latin America
-----------------------------
After the PAHO/WHO epidemiological alert on KPC type carbapenemases
was issued in June 2010, PAHO/WHO with support of the antimicrobial
service of the National Institute of Infectious Diseases Dr Carlos G
Malbran held training sessions and established the regional protocol
for the detection of carbapenemases, including NDM, which strengthened
surveillance and detection and diagnosis capacity of the Latin
American Surveillance Network Antimicrobial Drug Resistance
(ReLAVRA).

Laboratory detection
--------------------
The 1st line of defense to contain these multiresistant pathogens
includes the laboratories, along with adequate detection of the
mechanism and prevalence research. Authorities, including committees
of healthcare associated infection control and national level health
authorities must be provided with information to alert other hospital
centers.

Through the ReLAVRA network, the laboratories in the Region have the
tools for the phenotypical detection of NDM carbapenemases. The strain
is molecularly standardized in the same national reference laboratory,
or it may be sent for its molecular confirmation to the Regional
Reference Laboratory, the Institute of Infectious Diseases Dr Carlos G
Malbran.

Recommendations
---------------
Methods of surveillance and epidemiological research:
1. Increase the participation of laboratories in the surveillance
systems for the early detection of outbreaks, for the purpose of early
guidance of control measures.
2. Apply the regional protocol for the detection of carbapenemases and
strain reference in suspected cases at the national reference
laboratories level.
3. Send the suspected strain to the national or regional reference
laboratory for confirmation and molecular typing of carbapenemases.
4. Disseminate the information and recommendations to alert health
workers and decision-makers at all levels.

Antimicrobial treatment:
Limited clinical experience indicates that antibiotic combinations
produce better results than monotherapy. However, it is not possible
to issue a general recommendation of antimicrobial treatment due to
the lack of solid evidence on its effectiveness. Because of the
complexity of the treatment, infectious disease specialists must
prescribe it.

Infection prevention and control measures:
The prevention and control measures against infections in hospitals
are intended for patients who are colonized and with infection by the
NDM pathogen.

In addition to standard precautions, contact precautions should be
applied.
- Hand washing using water and soap or glycerinated alcohol.
- Use of gloves and gowns for close contact with patients and for
contact with secretions.
- Isolation in individual room or cohort.
- Separation between beds of at least 1 meter [3 ft].
- Cleaning the surroundings with chlorine (bleach) dilution (1:10).
