I read with interest the article published on or around 18 May [2007]
concerning the 1st confirmed diagnosis of squirrelpox in a red
squirrel in Scotland. Whilst the article is accurate in terms of the
emergence of the disease in Scotland the by-line to the article is misleading.
It is true to say that we do not know for definite how related the
virus, that is causing disease in the UK red squirrel population, is
to the squirrel fibroma virus described in Michigan, but equally we
have no evidence that they are one and the same virus.
More specifically the squirrelpox virus in the UK does not cause
fibromas in grey squirrels. Indeed currently there is no known
pathology in the grey squirrels associated with squirrelpox virus
infection despite serological evidence that approximately 60 percent
of the grey squirrel population across England and Wales have been infected.
Post-mortem analysis of many affected grey squirrels has so far
failed to find pathological evidence of the infection. The squirrel
fibroma virus that has been described in Michigan has been suggested
to be a member of the leporipox genus of the poxviruses, although how
much genomic characterisation has been performed on the virus I am unsure.
Our work on the squirrelpox virus in the UK has shown that although
the virus is undoubtedly a poxvirus, phylogenetic analyses failed to
place it with any of the other poxvirus species and instead suggested
it should be classified on its own in a previously unrecognised genus
of the poxvirus family.

[Perhaps Dr. McInnes' work will reveal the exact nature of the UK pox
virus and perhaps there is something his work will uncover to shed
more light on this virus. Thank you for letting us know of your work.- Mod.TG]
