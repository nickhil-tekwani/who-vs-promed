Kentucky soybean update: Rust, no. Sudden death syndrome: yes
-------------------------------------------------------------
As of August 3005, there is no confirmed soybean rust anywhere near Kentucky.
However, according to Donald Hershman, Plant Pathologist, University
of Kentucky Plant Disease Diagnostic Lab at Princeton has received
numerous samples of soybean sudden death syndrome (SDS). Hershman
reports that SDS is developing rapidly in some fields in southern
Illinois, suggesting that SDS may be a significant player this year.
By way of background, SDS is a root disease caused by the fungal
pathogen _Fusarium solani_) f.sp. _glycines_. Roots of plants are
infected and become diseased during the vegetative stages of plant
development. Then, typically as plants enter the pod development
stages, foliar symptoms are expressed as a result of foliar
sensitivity to one or more plant toxins produced by the fungus in
diseased root tissue.
In extreme cases, plants can die prematurely, with yields being
dramatically impacted. In some years (such as 2004), plants will show
symptoms early and later recover, with no impact on crop yield. In
most years the response is somewhere in the middle of these 2
extremes.
SDS is characterized by a rotting of the primary and secondary root
system and a subtle brown discoloration of the stem tissue
immediately inside the green exterior. Leaf symptoms that start as
yellow spots and blotches between the veins of upper leaves
(usually), leading to large areas of brown tissue between the veins,
and eventual defoliation of the leaflets, but not the petioles.
Abortion of flowers and young pods is common. Symptoms usually
develop first in hot spots in fields of varying shapes and sizes.
Entire fields may eventually become involved in severe instances, but
even then, there are typically areas in fields where the disease is
more severe than in others.
At this time, there is nothing that can be done to make the disease
less or more serious. The die is cast, as it were. SDS is in a race
against time with the crop. If the crop reaches the R5-R6 stage
before the disease is severe, then the yield prognosis will be
excellent. Serious disease prior to the R5 stage, however, can result
in substantial yield reductions. Typically the earlier the onset of
serious SDS, the greater the impact will be on crop yield.
Hershman was surprised to see so much SDS, considering the
predominately dry conditions we had in June and July. He recalled the
cool conditions that lingered in April and early May, and the fact
that many growers planted earlier than normal in an attempt to escape
soybean rust. Both the cooler soils and early planting dates may have
resulted in more root infection by the SDS pathogen than is "normal".
Then, the later season moisture stress conditions probably encouraged
foliar symptom expression of SDS.
He said that there is nothing one can do now to ameliorate the
effects of SDS; the disease will have to run its course. However, the
disease can be drastically reduced next season by planting a
resistant variety coupled with avoiding late-April and early-May
planting dates.

[Initially, the cause of SDS was elusive, with mechanical, cultural,
environmental and biological factors all considered possible. Early
studies involving soil fumigation indicated that the origin was
biological. Subsequent work in Arkansas and Mississippi proved that
SDS is caused by a strain of the common soil fungus _Fusarium solani_
(FS-A). This result has been confirmed by work in Indiana and
Missouri and is now generally accepted. Although FS-A is the primary
organism associated with SDS, other pathogens may also be involved in
disease development. The most studied of these is the soybean cyst
nematode (SCN). Mississippi researchers found that while SCN is not
required for severe SDS to occur, SCN at sufficient levels
exacerbates foliar symptoms, leading to early and severe SDS. This
finding is important, since the disease's timing and severity,
relative to soybean development, determines how severely the yields
are reduced. In addition to SCN, other soybean pathogens (foliar and
root/stem infecting) are being studied for their potential role in
SDS development. Preliminary data suggest that any stress factor
(biological, mechanical or environmental) may magnify SDS symptom
expression and cause SDS-affected plants to deteriorate earlier and
die prematurely.
Other conditions that affect SDS severity are planting date and
nematode injury. Early planted soybeans generally suffer more injury
than those planted later. The positive correlation between soybean
cyst nematode injury and SDS severity was noted by some of the first
researchers to study the disease. While the presence of _H. glycines_
tends to exacerbate problems with SDS, it is not required for
successful establishment of _F. solani_ f. sp. _glycines_ in its host.
The best way to avoid SDS in future cropping is to avoid early
planting, plant early to mid-season varieties, and plant varieties in
SDS-prone fields which are not highly susceptible to SDS. True
resistance to SDS is not yet available. However, avoiding planting
highly susceptible varieties will usually help by delaying disease
onset until the later stages of crop development as discussed above.
