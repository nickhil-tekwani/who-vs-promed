People with Crohn's disease (CD) are 7-fold more likely to have in
their gut tissues the bacterium that causes a digestive-tract disease
in cattle called Johne's disease. The role this bacterium may or may
not play in causing CD is a top research priority, according to a
[2007] report released by the American Academy of Microbiology
[<http://www.asm.org/ASM/files/ccLibraryFiles/Filename/000000004169/MAP.pdf>].
The report points out that the cause of CD is unknown, and the
possible role of this bacterium, which could conceivably be passed up
the food chain to people, has received too little attention from the
research community.

The report, _Mycobacterium avium paratuberculosis_: Incidental Human
Pathogen or Public Health Threat?, summarizes conclusions and
recommendations from a colloquium convened by the American Academy of
Microbiology in June 2007 that brought together experts in
microbiology, medicine, veterinary pathology, epidemiology, infectious
diseases, and food safety. Colloquium participants described the state
of knowledge about the relationship between _Mycobacterium avium
subspecies paratuberculosis_ (MAP) and CD and developed a research
agenda to move the field forward. [See ProMED archive from 1999 listed
below].

Scientists largely agree that multiple factors cause CD, including an
environmental stimulus, a genetic propensity, and an overactive
inflammatory and immune system triggered by an unknown event. There
is mounting evidence that the unknown trigger may be infectious in
origin, with several bacteria currently under consideration.

This complicated network of causation has confounded efforts to
understand CD, says Carol Nacy, Ph.D., CEO of Sequella, Inc., who
chaired the colloquium and is the report's co-author. MAP may be one
of the causes of CD, Nacy adds, since, among other things, multiple
studies identified the pathogen in tissues of CD patients. Treating
some of these patients with antibiotics that target _Mycobacteria_
provided relief from symptoms.

Johne's disease is a severe and fatal bacterial infection that
strikes cattle, sheep, and other livestock. MAP has long been
identified as the cause of Johne's disease. Despite efforts to limit
the spread of MAP, roughly 68 percent of cattle herds in this country
are infected, meaning one or more animals in the herd carry the
bacterium and may develop Johne's disease or spread the infection to
other animals. MAP has been found in some dairy products (milk and
cheese) and beef on supermarket shelves.

The critical steps for research now, according to the report, are to
determine whether humans are exposed and infected with MAP by eating
infected meat and dairy products and whether MAP causes or incites CD
or whether it is only incidentally present in those afflicted with
the disease. The prospect that MAP could play a role in the
incitement or development of CD is a sobering one, and, once the
situation becomes clearer through research, there could be important
changes in store for agriculture, food safety, and public health. It
is in the best interest of the public that the possible connection
between MAP and CD be explored exhaustively, according to the report.

The research agenda, however, is seriously hampered by the lack of
reliable methods for isolating and identifying MAP and for diagnosing
people with MAP infection. Public health laboratories and U.S.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention laboratories have made it
clear they cannot grow MAP in the laboratory, an inability that
hinders diagnosis and screening. The report recommends establishment
of a task-force to develop a specific road map for improved methods
for MAP detection and diagnosis.

[Johne's disease is a contagious, chronic enteritis in cattle and
other ruminants that results in chronic diarrhea, wasting, and
decreased milk production. It is caused by _Mycobacterium avium
subspecies paratuberculosis_ (MAP). The infection starts either in
the uterus in some animals or during or shortly after birth by
swallowing infected manure or milk; signs of disease usually do not
develop until 2 to 4 years later
(<http://njaes.rutgers.edu/pubs/publication.asp?pid=FS781>).
Diagnosis is made most commonly by fecal culture or detection of
antibody in serum by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).

The USDA reported that MAP was isolated from fecal samples in 2/3rds
of dairy herds in the U.S. in 2007
(<http://nahms.aphis.usda.gov/dairy/dairy07/Dairy2007_Johnes.pdf>).
MAP can survive pasteurization and be in cartons of milk on grocery
store shelves. In fact, researchers found that up to 25 percent of
milk on store shelves in central and southern England contained MAP
DNA (Millar D, et al. IS900 PCR to Detect _Mycobacterium
paratuberculosis_ in Retail Supplies of Whole Pasteurized Cow's Milk
in England and Wales. Applied and Environmental Microbiology. 1996;
62:3446-52).

Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory disease of the
gastrointestinal tract in humans. It most commonly affects the lower
small intestine and large intestine. The cause of the disease is
unknown. In addition to a genetic predisposition, a microbial
etiology has been implicated. However, despite the similarity of
clinical presentation and histopathology of Crohn's disease in humans
to that of Johne's disease in ruminants, the association of MAP and
Crohn's has remained speculative. The report from the American
Academy of Microbiology
(<http://www.asm.org/ASM/files/ccLibraryFiles/Filename/000000004169/MAP.pdf>)
does not present new data, but lays out the evidence and suggests
further study.

MAP is a member of the _Mycobacterium avium_ complex (MAC) and is an
obligate intracellular pathogen. Because of its slow and fastidious
growth in vitro, studies that use in vitro culture to identify MAP
may be falsely negative. PCR-based methods have been developed to
overcome these problems. Although MAP is found in intestinal tissues
by PCR or antibodies to MAP are found in serum in larger numbers of
patients with Crohn's disease than those with ulcerative colitis or
healthy controls, its role in the etiology of Crohn's disease may be
as a primary causative agent, a secondary agent, or perhaps a
non-pathogenic colonizer (Feller M, et al. Lancet Infection. 2007;
7:607-13).

If MAP is found as the cause of Crohn's, this would have important
public health and treatment implications. A combination of rifabutin,
clarithromycin and clofazimine (Myoconda)
(<http://www.giacondalimited.com/pages/products/myo_conda.html>),
commonly used to treat MAC infections, reportedly has a remission
rate of 65 percent and a clinical response rate of almost 95 percent
in clinical phase II trials. - Mod.ML]
