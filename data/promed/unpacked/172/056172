Victoria's outbreak of legionnaires' disease, which has claimed two lives,
continues to grow as 12 more patients were today confirmed with the illness.
"What we have as of this morning is a total of 29 cases of legionnaires'
disease who have visited the (Melbourne) aquarium," state health department
spokesman Dr John Carnie told reporters. "Of these, eight patients remain
in a critical condition." No more deaths had occurred as a result of the
outbreak beyond the two reported yesterday.
The confirmed cases included 14 men and 15 women ranging in age from 26 to
89 years, Dr Carnie said. A further 27 related cases are suspected,
including two in Tasmania, one in Queensland and one in Western Australia,
Dr Carnie said.
New South Wales health authorities said none of eight cases reported in NSW
in the past two months were connected to the Victorian epidemic.
But a spokesman for NSW Health Minister Craig Knowles said the state was
bracing for more cases. "NSW Health officials expect to have some cases
from that aquarium
outbreak because it was such a tightly enclosed space and so many people
have been through there - mainly tourists," the spokesman said.
The number of people affected made the current outbreak Victoria's biggest.
"But by far the largest (in Australia) was in Wollongong in 1987 where
there were 44 cases and 10 deaths."
Dr Carnie said community alarm over the outbreak should be tempered by the
knowledge that cases were only now emerging that had been exposed to the
bacteria at the aquarium between April 11 and 21. "There is no ongoing
transmission. This is not a disease that is transmitted from person to
person ... The exposure has been at the
aquarium." The disease can take up to two weeks to incubate and emerges
with flu-like symptoms.
The aquarium cooling towers had been cleaned twice and would be tested
again tomorrow, but test results take eight to 10 days, so no results were
available yet.
"The frequency of maintenance and the frequency of cleaning, and so on, is
one of the issues that we would be looking at in terms of new regulations,"
Dr. Carnie said.
Meanwhile, the state government is considering a tougher system of
inspections to halt the rise in legionnaires' cases in Victoria in the past
five or six years. Health Minister John Thwaites today said it was
unacceptable that visitors to a new building could be exposed to the disease.
"It is not acceptable to have a situation where people going into a new
building can become exposed in this way," Mr Thwaites told reporters.
"...Most of the problem [with legionellosis in the past has been
associated with older cooling towers, where there had been a problem with
maintenance. In this case, we have a new building and we have to get to the
bottom of how this could have occurred with a new building."
The government had established a working party to advise on how the
incidence of _Legionella_ infection could be reduced. Mr Thwaites said he
was not satisfied with the regulations governing maintenance of the 10
000-odd water cooling towers around Melbourne.
"We also need to look at toughening up the regulatory framework for
legionellosis - we need to look at whether more inspections and better
auditing is required. I'm not satisfied with the regulatory framework which
has been in place. I don't believe the regulations are tough enough, and
that's why I've set up a committee to get that expert advice."
