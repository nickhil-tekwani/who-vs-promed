Virological Findings and Status of the Outbreak of Hand, Foot & Mouth Disease
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Postmortem findings of the 2 children, who died on 30 Sep 2000, [have
revealed the presence of virus in both the lung and brain. Dr Ling Ai Ee
and Dr Chan Kwai Peng, of the Department of Pathology at the Singapore
General Hospital (SGH), who were the principal investigating virologists in
the current Hand, Foot & Mouth Disease (HFMD) outbreak, have identified
Enterovirus 71 (EV71)) in samples from these two children. These findings
[have been confirmed by the results of independent test at the Centers for
Disease Control in Atlanta, which we have just received. SGH's virologists
also found EV71 present in the samples from the surviving sibling of these
2 children. No virus has, so far, been identified in the 2-year old child
who died on 10 Sep 2000, although postmortem findings showed that he had
viral infection of the lungs.
Of the completed virological studies, so far, enteroviruses [have been
isolated from 80 percent of the samples from fatal and hospitalised cases and
contacts. EV71 has been confirmed in almost half of the positive samples and
typing is continuing in the others. From these findings, the Task Force
strongly believes that EV71 is the main cause of the HFMD outbreak, although
other enteroviruses besides EV 71 have also been isolated, a common finding
in all other outbreaks of HFMD elsewhere. In addition, the National
University of Singapore in collaboration with the Virology Laboratory at SGH
has found that the [nucleotide? sequences of [the viruses for the fatal
cases were closely related to [those of an EV71 strain [isolate?
associated with the outbreak in the region in 1997.
The current status of the HFDV in Singapore is the following. Notifications
of HFMD among children below 5 years peaked on 3 and 4 Oct 2000 with 187 and
195 cases, respectively. These are children who were most likely infected on
28 to 30 Sep 2000, before the closure of preschools. Since the closure of
the preschools, the number of cases have dropped steadily. The average daily
number of notified cases for the first week from 1 Oct was 200 and this
dropped to 90 in the second week. Over the past 7 days, the daily average
number of cases was 61. We are continuing to see an encouraging decrease in
the number of cases. Hospitalised cases have also dropped significantly. As
at 12 noon on 19 Oct 2000, these numbered 3, compared to 33 on 4 Oct 2000.
All cases are mild and in stable condition.
This current situation shows that the control measures taken have been
effective in reducing the transmission of the disease. However, we would
like to urge the public and all schools to continue to cooperate and remain
vigilant so that the situation will continue to improve further.
