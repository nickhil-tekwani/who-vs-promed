Equine piroplasmosis found in 11 states
----------------------------------------
Animal health authorities investigating an outbreak of equine
piroplasmosis on a South Texas ranch have now located 317 positive
horses. These horses include 288 on the index ranch, 7 on other
premises in Texas, 1 in Alabama, 2 in California, 5 in Florida, 1 in
Georgia, 5 in Louisiana, 1 in Minnesota, 2 in North Carolina, 3 in
New Jersey, 1 in Tennessee, and 1 in Wisconsin. All known positive
horses are under quarantine, and testing of all epidemiologically
linked horses is ongoing.

The information was released in a 13 Nov 2009 report issued to the
World Organization for Animal Health (Office International des
Epizooties, or OIE) by John Clifford, DVM, deputy administrator of
the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. [The report is
available at
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=8647>].

Officials in the United States have screened all imported horses for
piroplasmosis for nearly 30 years. The disease was officially
eradicated from the United States in 1988. It is spread by as many as
15 species of ticks, the use of contaminated needles, and possibly
through blood-contaminated semen of infected stallions.

Signs of equine piroplasmosis can include a host of nonspecific
clinical signs, such as fever or anemia, and some infected horses
might appear well. Blood tests are needed to diagnosis the disease.
The only treatment is a potent type of chemotherapy that can have
serious side effects in some horses.

As a result of the current investigation, Canada and several states
have restricted the importation of horses from Texas. Bob Hillman,
DVM, Texas' state veterinarian and head of the Texas Animal Health
Commission, urged horse owners and veterinarians to check with animal
health officials for any state of destination to ensure the animals
have met all entry requirements.

[Tick control is another possibility. However, use caution with
chemicals on horses. Some chemicals such as coumaphos may be toxic to
horses when used repeatedly. It is important to adhere to label
directions regarding concentrations and frequency of use.

Currently, there are very few chemicals for controlling ticks
licensed for use in pastures where animals may be grazing.

This outbreak was originally identified in Keberg county of Texas and
clearly the tracings of animal movements into and out of the area
prior to quarantine have resulted in this substantial expansion of the disease.

While this disease is still classified as a foreign animal disease
(FAD), it appears it will take some time and considerable effort and
resources before this is brought under control. One might wonder if
this actually is an endemic disease. It appears the wide variety of
ticks capable of transmitting it complicate the epidemiology of this disease.
