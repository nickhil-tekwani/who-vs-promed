[2] USA (California): sewage

Last month [June 2022], Stanford's Sewer Coronavirus Alert Network, or SCAN, added monkeypox to the suite of viruses it checks wastewater for daily. Since then, monkeypox has been detected in 10 of the 11 sewer systems that SCAN tests, including those in Sacramento, Palo Alto, and several other cities in California's Bay Area.

SCAN began to monitor California wastewater for COVID-19 in 2020. It's the only public effort in the US to test if monkeypox is detectable in the shower, sink, and toilet water that is sent to wastewater treatment plants for decontamination. Extracting genetic material from the solids absorbed in raw, unprocessed sewage can provide a community-level look at where a virus or bacteria has spread, and how prevalent an outbreak is.

Over the past 2 years, the concentration of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in wastewater has mirrored trends in COVID-19 cases confirmed by testing individuals. In late 2021, wastewater surveillance suggested the omicron variant was prevalent in the US much earlier than clinical testing reported.

Early data suggest that the concentration of monkeypox in wastewater can similarly inform us about monkeypox cases in the community, according to Alexandria Boehm, co-director of SCAN and a Stanford professor studying how pathogens are transmitted.

Now Boehm and her colleagues are working to use their wastewater data to estimate the actual number of people with monkeypox in the communities they monitor by modeling how wastewater data and monkeypox cases from the past month correlate. This estimate, which can be updated daily, would be a much faster way to track community spread than waiting for symptomatic patients to go to a doctor and get tested.

Unlike a COVID test, monkeypox can only be tested for if the patient already has skin boils that a doctor can swab and test. These boils only appear 1-2 weeks after a person has been infected. Wastewater surveillance could help catch monkeypox infections much earlier.

This approach is particularly useful when there's a clinical testing bottleneck. Everyone poops, but very few people are getting tested for monkeypox. Prior to 22 Jun [2022], only about 70 out of over 200 CDC laboratories nationwide were authorized to test for monkeypox. Of these, 5 companies have since been authorized to perform monkeypox testing, but scaling up will take time.

A lack of accurate data on monkeypox infections makes it harder to create a model that can use wastewater to estimate monkeypox cases, because lack of testing makes it difficult to establish a real-world relationship between the 2.

Monkeypox is in the same virus family as smallpox but is less infectious and generally has more mild symptoms. It's still unpleasant: alongside flu-like symptoms, monkeypox's telltale sign is the appearance of pus-filled blisters on the face, hands, feet, or genitals. Running water over these open sores in the shower or while washing your hands can catapult monkeypox DNA into wastewater.

Recent data suggest that the DNA of monkeypox can also be detected in a variety of bodily fluids from those infected. That includes respiratory and nasal secretions, spit, urine, feces, and semen, meaning a flushed tissue from someone with monkeypox can register the virus in wastewater.

If a pathogen's genetic footprint can persist in wastewater for over 24 hours, SCAN can likely detect it. COVID-19 viral RNA persists in wastewater for well over 10 days. Though monkeypox DNA seems to clear the 24-hour threshold, there is no public research on how long it persists.

A question remains as to how much monkeypox DNA needs to get into the wastewater for SCAN to actually detect it. SCAN can sniff out COVID from the wastewater from as few as 2 infected people among 100 000.

Even in a state like California, which keeps sewage and water drains separate, rain dilutes the quantity of viral DNA in wastewater. To account for that, SCAN normalizes its estimates using a virus with a well-established expected quantity: pepper mild mottle virus. Healthy humans excrete the harmless virus after eating pepper and pepper-based products, making it the most abundant RNA virus in human feces (conveniently, it's also very stable in water).

There is no evidence that you can contract monkeypox from wastewater itself. What drives human-to-human transmission is prolonged, close contact with an infected person that exposes you directly to their rash, bodily fluids, or respiratory droplets, according to the World Health Organization. Bedding and clothing from those with monkeypox can spread the virus too.

Monkeypox has its own vaccine. The smallpox vaccine, which the US has in its national stockpiles, also offers protection against it. But public access to monkeypox testing, treatment, and vaccines is still limited. Examining wastewater can help public health officials spot monkeypox outbreaks without widespread testing and determine where to invest resources.

Wastewater surveillance can also detect new monkeypox variants, 2 of which are currently circulating in the US. Virtually all of the current outbreak is driven by monkeypox's West African strain, which SCAN has a specific test for. This strain is more infectious but far less deadly than the other strain, known as the Congo Basin clade. In recent years, monkeypox has killed 3-6% of those it infects, and it is deadlier in young children. This year monkeypox has killed 3 people worldwide.

SCAN is, at present, the only effort releasing data on monkeypox in wastewater. "The Bay Area is at the forefront of wastewater surveillance because we are Silicon Valley, after all," Boehm says. "But it's not that California has monkeypox in the wastewater and no place else does."

The risk of the monkeypox virus to people in Scotland is low, according to a public health expert.

Prof Linda Bauld said only a small number of cases had been identified north of the border, it is a mild illness, and there is a vaccine.

It came as the World Health Organisation declared the outbreak a global health emergency.

There have been 54 confirmed cases of the virus in Scotland since 23 May [2022]. They are among 2208 confirmed cases in the UK. Most [cases] are men who are gay, bisexual, or have sex with men. They are also linked to recent travel to London or Europe.

Prof Bauld, a professor of public health at the University of Edinburgh and an advisor to the Scottish government, told BBC Radio Scotland's The Sunday Show: "The risk to the public in Scotland remains low.

"The numbers are really small. It's a mild illness, and we have a vaccine originally developed for smallpox.

"So it's totally different from COVID-19, and that's a very important point to make."

The virus is not sexually transmitted, but it is passed by very close contact, she added.

"The reason the World Health Organisation has triggered this emergency response...is to send a very clear message to a number of countries who may not be responding to this global outbreak that more action is needed," she said.

"I know we're still in and coming out of a pandemic; we are going to see diseases like this emerge, but it needs to be put in a broader context and not alarm people."

Close contacts of people with the virus no longer need to isolate at home if they don't have symptoms.

Vaccinations are being offered to some men at higher risk of exposure to the infection and a small number of healthcare workers in high-risk settings.

A Nigerian man who went on the run after becoming Thailand's 1st monkeypox case was found in Phnom Penh on Saturday (23 Jul [2022]) and taken to hospital, the Cambodian Health Ministry said.

It comes the same day the World Health Organization officials in Geneva declared the monkeypox outbreak as a global health emergency on Saturday [23 Jul 2022].

The 27-year-old tourist -- who had overstayed his visa in Thailand -- was diagnosed with monkeypox in the resort city of Phuket on Monday [18 Jul 2022], a Thai health official said.

During his stay in Phuket, the man had visited 2 entertainment venues, and 142 people are now being screened for the virus, a health official said, adding that the man also had unprotected sex with a woman.

After learning of his diagnosis, he fled his Phuket accommodation, turned off his phone, and failed to respond to police or health workers' messages.

His getaway sparked a manhunt across Thailand, and authorities said Saturday [23 Jul 2022] his phone signal was detected in a northeastern province bordering Cambodia. After searching several locations Saturday [23 Jul 2022], Cambodian police found the runaway at a Phnom Penh guest house, and he has since been sent to the Khmer-Soviet Friendship Hospital for medical treatment.

"In order to prevent the infection of monkeypox virus, the Ministry of Health appeals to all people who have direct contact with the Nigerian patient to isolate themselves and seek health checks," the Cambodian ministry said in a statement.
