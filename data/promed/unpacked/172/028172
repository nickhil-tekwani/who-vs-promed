Scientists are delving into dung dropped by Adelie penguins perhaps 8,000
years ago in the Antarctic to trace the history of influenza. The New
Zealand government has committed $236,000 over three years to a research
program to track the evolution of the disease.
Penguin dung was selected because the cold of Antarctica meant some
fragments of the virus' RNA -- ribonucleic acid, or the active form of DNA
-- was likely to be preserved in a meter thick layer of frozen guano under
colonies on Ross Island, said Auckland University structural biologist
Peter Metcalf. "These penguins are just sitting there in this same little
patch of land where they've been doing it for thousands of years," he told
news media on Monday. "We know that penguins do get flu but nobody has
ever isolated a flu virus from them."
The connection between bird influenza and the human condition was
illustrated last year when Hong Kong's chicken population was mass
slaughtered because of fears that they carried a virus that could cross
over to humans. "There are a lot of bird [influenzaviruses] out there and
some of them seem to get through to humans and cause these big epidemics
which we get every year," said Metcalf. Bird influenza is spread through
the feces, and the penguin dung would give scientists the chance to track
the development of the fast-evolving influenza virus, he said.
