Avian influenza in Russia
--------------------------
Information received on 24 Jul 2005 from Dr Evgueny A. Nepoklonov, Head of
the Main Veterinary Department, Ministry of Agriculture and Food, Moscow:
Report date: 24 Jul 2005.
Outbreaks of avian influenza were reported in private farms in 9 villages
in the districts of Kupino, Dovolnoye and Chistoozernoye, Novosibirsk region.
Precise identification of agent: influenza virus type A. The haemagglutinin
subtype has been preliminarily (from pathological material) identified as
H5. After confirmation by virus isolation a separate notification will be
sent. Tests are being performed to determine the neuraminidase type.
Date of 1st confirmation of the event: 23 Jul 2005.
Date of start of the event: 18 Jul 2005.
Nature of diagnosis: clinical, post-mortem and laboratory.
Description of affected populations: chickens, turkeys, ducks, geese.
Source of outbreaks or origin of infection: an epidemiological analysis has
shown that the disease started in a flock in contact with wild waterfowl at
open water reservoirs. This is proposed as the primary source of the virus.
In addition, there is evidence of the disease in wild birds.
Control measures undertaken:
- stamping out;
- quarantine;
- movement control inside the country;
- screening;
- zoning;
- disinfection of infected premises/establishments.
Vaccination is prohibited.
Other details/comments:
- Considering the low mortality rate (oscillating, from 1 to 2.6 percent
depending on the locality), the virus titres are very high in some samples
of pathological material.
- No signs of the disease have appeared in commercial poultry farms in the
region.
- The reasons for the disease's lack of species specificity are still
unclear. Bacteriological and toxicological tests of samples of water and
soil from around the water and feeding points from the affected areas are
continuing.
- Newcastle disease virus was not found in samples from the affected areas.

expected. - Mod.AS]

More Cases Of Bird Flu In Siberia
----------------------------------
The head of Russia's Veterinary Monitoring Service says the bird flu virus
has broken out in 4 rural districts of Siberia, according to preliminary
evidence [see item above].
Interfax quotes Sergei Dankvert as saying the initial outbreak was
discovered last week in the village of Suzdalka, in the western Siberian
region of Novosibirsk.
Now, cases among wild birds have been found in 3 more districts of
Novosibirsk Oblast -- Dovolnoe, Kupino, and Chistozernoe. Authorities in
neighboring Kazakhstan have been informed, as the 3 districts lie close to
the Kazakh border.
The H5N1 strain of bird flu has so far been transmitted mainly between
animals. It is carried by migratory birds. But it has killed at least 58
people in southeast Asia and China since 2003.
Experts' greatest fear is that the virus could mutate into a highly
infectious strain that could be easily transmitted from animals to humans,
or from humans to humans.
