Bhubaneswar's Regional Medical Research Centre has started a study across 14 blocks in Odisha's Koraput for coordinated interventions to check animal-to-human transmission of anthrax. The study is likely to be completed by end of next year [2022]. It will test the effectiveness of public health interventions to check the disease transmission in Koraput, the epicentre of anthrax in Odisha. Of the 30 districts of Odisha, 19 are reported as endemic for human anthrax. In all 19 districts, anthrax was diagnosed among livestock. In 4 districts -- Koraput, Rayagada, Malkangiri, and Sundergarh -- human anthrax cases were reported. Among the 3 types of anthrax, the cutaneous form was most common across the state.

Koraput has accounted for 300 human anthrax cases and 10 deaths over the last 6 years. Around 1208 cases and 436 deaths were reported during the period. Anthrax is a zoonotic disease that affects the lungs, intestines, and skin. It is considered fatal if patients are not diagnosed early and treated promptly with antibiotics. The disease can transmit from animals to humans.

"In the study, we will use a package of interventions to show which one works better to eliminate human anthrax cases, as elimination of animal anthrax cases is difficult as it is difficult to control animals. Human anthrax can be eliminated through behavioural change, awareness, regular vaccination of animals. We will see if we vaccinate animals properly and cut down the cases," said Debadutta Bhattacharya, one of the scientists involved in the study.

Bhattacharya said anthrax is endemic in West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, and Andhra Pradesh and that this is the 1st such study.

Conventional butchering practices, unsafe handling and disposal of the contaminated carcasses, and poor vaccination coverage are seen among the main reasons behind anthrax outbreaks in Odisha's tribal districts. In the Kashipur block of Rayagada district, dead-cattle meat is also consumed, which is also among the causes of the infections.

Bhattacharya said they plan to enroll 2640 adults across 112 villages in Koraput for the study and provide capacity building training on awareness. "We would establish a state-level laboratory for timely diagnosis and management of human anthrax cases. Surveillance network will be strengthened to track the cases in early-stage and risk zoning will be done for focused surveillance in endemic areas."

Odisha is a constant in the Indian anthrax statistics with human cases. There have been significant numbers of bovine outbreaks and cases on an essentially annual basis. The disease is enzootic and endemic in some 19 of the 30 districts in the state. This is a long overdue study, and they are to be congratulated for initiating it. I am willing to predict that the Regional Medical Research Centre will discover that the optimum and most cost-effective and efficient control procedure lies not in public health but in ensuring that the regional veterinary animal health service has a thorough annual vaccination programme and proper carcass disposal (burning or carcass burial). Then like everywhere else -- e.g., the US Dakotas, the Canadian provinces, Argentina -- they will see the human cases disappear, whether or not the communities learn to report suspect livestock deaths and desist from butchering sick cattle. Many countries have initiated and run effective anthrax control and surveillance programmes, but a successful programme does generate agricultural and rural support. And instead of depending on new human cases or not, it is a constant feature that the vaccination procrastinators' cattle will come down with the disease, publicly shaming them, and also announcing loudly that the vaccination must continue until you have a sound period of no outbreaks for some 6-8 years. The nice thing about anthrax vaccination, as well as the proper management of anthrax carcasses, is that effective control = eradication. All you need after that is good surveillance for as and when and if new cases appear.

This will be a very revealing study and I know that we wish the Regional Medical Research Centre and Debadutta Bhattacharya and his colleagues success. We look forward to hearing of their study's results. - Mod.MHJ
