[So far the identity and place of residence of the 100th case has not
been announced. According to the Flu Trackers web-site the 100th case
may have occurred in the Dakahlia governorate, but the details are
unknown (see:
<http://afludiary.blogspot.com/2010/02/egyptian-media-bird-flu-cases-101-102.html>). The number of human cases of avian influenza H5N1 in Egypt is running at more than twice the rate observed at this time in the previous year, and unlike the winter of 2009, many of this year's cases involve
adults.

The Governorate of Kafr El Sheikh is located at 23 in the map of the
Governorates of Egypt at:
