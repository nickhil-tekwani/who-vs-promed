What's causing the death of shovelnose sturgeon in the Wabash River
is a mystery that the Department of Natural Resources (DNR),
Department of Environmental Management (DEM), and scientists at
Purdue University are trying to uncover. Since mid-July [2007] about
100 of the odd-looking fish have been found dead along a stretch of
the Wabash from Delphi to Attica [Indiana].
On 22 Jul 2007, DNR Conservation Officer, Matt Tholen, found 35 in
just a mile and a half (2.4 km) near the Tippecanoe-Warren County
line [in west central Indiana]. "They've been found individually.
You'd find one, then 10 or 20 yards (9-18 m) down find another," Tholen said.
Whatever it is seems to only affect average size sturgeons about
24-32 inches (60-80 cm) in length. "We've found no small fish, and no
other (species) of fish," said Tholen, who is also public information
officer for District 3.
Tholen and Officer Todd Pekny have taken samples of the dead sturgeon
to Purdue University for testing. "They're running tests on fat
tissue," Tholen said. "I've never seen anything like this and we're
just waiting on the results."
Shovelnose sturgeons are found in Indiana's larger rivers like the
Wabash, as well as the Missouri and Mississippi rivers.
Besides being a flavorful meat fish, especially when smoked, they
have become more popular for their roe, or eggs, which are used for caviar.
Although larger species of sturgeon in central Asian waters at one
time provided most of the world's supply of caviar, due to habitat
degradation, pollution, and overfishing, smaller species like the
shovelnose have been harvested for the delicacy.
Shovelnose are not considered endangered at this point, but there are
concerns, according to a series of studies completed in 2006 by
Purdue University fisheries biologist, Trent Sutton. "The problem
with sturgeons in general is that they are a long-lived fish that
take a long time to reach sexual maturity," Sutton said.
The shovelnose, the smallest of sturgeons, reaches sexual maturity
between ages 6 and 9, and spawns every other year. Like other
sturgeon species it is particularly vulnerable to overfishing because
of the time required to breed and regenerate their numbers.
Sutton's research found the Wabash River population appears to be
stable, but his sampling uncovered few young fish in the river. "This
raises a few red flags," Sutton said. "This means that either the
females aren't laying eggs or that they aren't spawning at all --
both of which would have serious ramifications."
But this year [2007], according to DNR Chief of Fisheries, Bill
James, a spawning population was discovered in the general area of
the recent deaths. To James that indicates a healthy population
overall. "There was a successful spawning this spring, and shovelnose
sturgeon in the Wabash are deemed a very healthy population."
That is despite pressures from invasive aquatic species, fishing
pressures, and transporting some sturgeon to other states to
reintroduce their populations.
He also explained the dead fish had no signs of obvious disease, and
because the fish don't appear to have died in mass as might occur in
a contaminant spill, James speculates it may be several causes.
"The fish that died appeared healthy and not as if their food supply
was affected. It may be an incremental build up of stresses --
spawning stress, low water flows this summer, or other environmental
conditions," said James.
Both dead fish and live samples collected recently are being tested
for comparisons, but no obvious cause has been determined yet.
In the meantime Tholen said he wants the public to be aware of the
unexplained sturgeon deaths. If anyone has information that may be
viable to the investigation call the local Indiana Conservation
Officer District #3 office at 765-447-9582, or the local sheriff's
department dispatch on the non-emergency number.
