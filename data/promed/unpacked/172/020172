Turkey: Possible Influence of Tamiflu Treatment and Winter Weather
------------------------------------------------------------------
Turkey stepped up efforts on Wednesday 11 Jan 2006 to halt outbreaks
of bird flu in both people and poultry, but U.N. experts said the
virus could become firmly established and threaten neighboring
countries. Experts said the H5N1 avian influenza virus could become
more active in the colder months in affected regions, and spread in
east Asia as people slaughter chickens for Lunar New Year
celebrations. It will cost international donors about UDS 1.4 billion
to finance the next phase of the global campaign against the virus,
including gearing up veterinary services and preparing expert teams
for quick deployment to outbreaks, a senior United Nations expert
said. But Dr. David Nabarro, U.N. senior coordinator for avian
influenza, said he was confident delegates to next week's bird flu
conference in Beijing would pledge the needed amount.
H5N1 has been found in wild birds and poultry in a third of Turkish
provinces. It has killed at least 2 children and infected more than a
dozen people in little more than a week. While overall very few
people have been infected -- about 150 [currently 148 according to
WHO] with 78 killed in 6 countries --- scientists fear the virus
could mutate into a form that can spread easily between humans,
causing a pandemic.
World Health Organization doctors said there was no sign of
human-to-human transmission in Turkey. They called for calm and said
there was no reason for tourists not to visit Turkey. The virus has
rapidly infected birds in about 30 out of 81 provinces in Turkey,
including Ankara, Istanbul and the tourism region near the Aegean
coast. Authorities, criticized for an initial slow response, have
killed more than 300 000 birds.
Turkish officials have been stressing that relatively few people
there have died, compared to Asia, where H5N1 has had about a
50-percent mortality rate. WHO said there is no evidence the virus
has changed greatly and says patients have been infected by close
contact with sick poultry -- in most cases children playing with
birds or helping families kill them. "Compared to the numbers in
Asia, we do not have too many deaths at the moment," said Dr. Guenael
Rodier, head of the WHO mission to Turkey, told a news conference.
"We need to investigate this and to see if the use of Tamiflu has
played a role in the (smaller) numbers," he said. "I have the feeling
that what is going on in Turkey can be brought under control
relatively easily like in Asia," Rodier added. "At the moment, there
is good awareness. We will try to keep some kind of momentum on these
issues for months to come."
Winter weather is almost certainly playing a role, experts agree.
Influenza and similar viruses always become more common in winter,
even in tropical zones where temperatures do not change much, for
reasons that are not clearly understood. Authorities believe many
poor families in eastern Turkey brought their sick birds into houses
when winter hit, increasing chances of infection.
More people are likely to be infected in Asia before this month's
Lunar New Year holidays, when consumption of poultry rises, Shigeru
Omi, WHO's regional director for the Western Pacific, told
Reuters.Eating well-cooked bird meat is not a risk, but slaughtering birds is.

Turkey: H5N1 Virus Found in Lungs of the 3rd Fatal Case
---------------------------------------------------------
Tests have shown that the H5N1 avian influenza virus was present in
the lungs of the Turkish child who died last week and who had
originally tested negative for avian influenza virus infection, the
state Anatolian News Agency said on Thursday 12 Jan 2006.
The elder brother and sister of the 11 year-old patient were the 1st
confirmed cases of bird flu among human beings outside China and
Southeast Asia. [The elder brother died] on 1 Jan 2006, [and the
sister died] on 5 Jan 2006 and [this 3rd sibling] died on 6 Jan 2006

Turkey: 2 More Human Cases of H5N1 Avian Influenza
-----------------------------------------------------
2 more Turks tested positive for the H5N1 avian influenza virus in
preliminary tests, the government said Thursday [12 Jan 2006],
bringing the total number of human infections to 18. Both victims
were from the stricken southeast, and had been in contact with
infected birds, officials said.
A Turkish lab also determined that last week's 3rd bird flu death
involved the H5N1 strain, the Health Ministry said, as authorities
stepped up the precautionary slaughter of thousands of birds in an
effort to keep the outbreak in check.

Avian Influenza Virus Mutation a Matter of Concern
--------------------------------------------------
Preliminary tests show that the strain of avian influenza virus that
has stricken at least 15 people in Turkey has evolved in a way that
could make it somewhat more hazardous to human beings, although it
still lacks the capacity to be passed easily from person to person,
international health officials said on Wed 11 Jan 2006. The analysis,
based on the sequencing of one of the virus's genes, suggests that at
least some of the H5N1 bird flu virus here carries a change in one of
its proteins, according to Michael L. Perdue of the World Health
Organization. That protein is what lets the virus attach to cells and
penetrate them [i.e. the haemagglutinin protein]. Influenza experts
are studying the apparent change to determine its significance,
Perdue said. A spokesman for Britain's Medical Research Council,
which is involved in the research, said it would take a few days to
confirm the preliminary findings. The experts say they believe the
genetic change could make it easier for bird flu to pass from
chickens to people. If the virus were to eventually gain the capacity
to be passed easily from person to person, it could trigger a global epidemic.
Nancy J. Cox, who heads the influenza branch at the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, said the change was found
in one sample of H5N1 isolated from a Turkish child who recently died
of the infection. The haemagglutinin protein, which the virus uses to
attach to cells of the respiratory tract, had an alteration not
usually seen in avian influenza viruses. Other incremental changes in
the virus have been seen in China and Viet Nam since outbreaks began in 2003.
2 [human] deaths have been attributed to avian influenza in Turkey.
The fatalities were the first outside China and Southeast Asia, areas
where a total of 78 people have died in the past two years. More than
100 people have been hospitalized in Turkey with flu symptoms. The
patients are under observation as they await test results to reveal
whether they suffer from bird flu.
Perdue noted that the Spanish influenza of 1918, which caused an
estimated 40 million deaths worldwide, began as an ordinary bird
virus but gradually evolved into a global human killer through a
series of these incremental changes. At a news conference in Ankara,
the Turkish capital, international health officials played down fears
of a pandemic.
Bernard Vallat, director of the World Organization for Animal Health,
said that the virus was probably introduced in Turkey in October
[2005]. Vallat said that besides weeding out poultry in infected
areas, fowl might have to be vaccinated. "The idea is that you create
a protective area around an outbreak through vaccination. This could
involve an entire province," he said. Turkish health workers have
killed more than 300 000 domestic birds in roundups across the
country since late December [2005]. In one district of Istanbul,
municipal sanitation officials went door to door in a rural hillside
suburb asking residents if they raised chickens and ducks. They
chased strays up and down the slippery, muddy hills and ravines, and
when they caught one, they stuffed it into a plastic bag. Signs
around the neighborhood read, "This District Has Chicken Plague."
Workers dressed in protective gear threw the bags into green
containers that looked like large garbage cans. A sanitation worker
attached a blue tube from a tank of carbon dioxide to the airtight
container, opened the valve and killed the birds. "We prefer to say
we are putting them to sleep," said Hikmet Karacay, an Agriculture
Ministry official. Residents, most of whom raised chickens as a
sideline to collect the eggs, cooperated. "The real problem is the
children," said [a resident], who has 2 daughters. "They like the
chickens. They are like pets. That's why it's better to do it at
night, when they don't witness the whole thing."

Tests Show Avian Influenza Virus Is Evolving As Expected
--------------------------------------------------------
Genetic tests of samples taken from Turkish victims of the bird flu
virus show it has made a small change, but probably not enough to
make it more dangerous yet, researchers said on Thursday [12 Jan
2006]. The mutation is one of those that would be expected in a
highly changeable virus, the experts said -- and is one of those that
would be predicted to eventually allow it to cause a pandemic.
H5N1 avian influenza has caused a burst of human infections in Turkey
and has been found in flocks of poultry across the country. It has
killed at least 2 children in Turkey, probably 3, and infected a
total of 18 people, according to Turkish authorities. Globally it has
infected just 147 people and killed 78 of them, according to the
tally from the World Health Organization, which only includes 4 of
the Turkish cases [i.e. only those confirmed by testing at a WHO
reference laboratory - Mod.CP].
Samples from 2 of the 1st Turkish victims were sent to a
WHO-affiliated laboratory in Britain for analysis. Scientists are
carefully watching the virus to see if it makes the changes needed to
allow it to easily pass from human to human -- which could spark a
pandemic that could kill millions. There were two different strains
of virus in the bodies of the teenage victims, said Dr. Ruben Donis,
team leader of the molecular genetics team of the U.S. Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention's Influenza branch. "One was a regular
virus like we have seen in poultry in Turkey before -- no surprises
there," Donis said in a telephone interview. But half the viruses had
a mutation in the haemagglutinin gene. the haemagglutinin gene
encodes the protein by which influenza viruses attach to the cells
they infect. This protein is the "H" in a flu virus's designation.
This mutation has been found in the past to enable the virus to
infect a greater range of cells via a structure known as sialic acid,
Donis said. "If you have this mutation, you have virus that can bind
to more different sialic acid variations," he said. This is only
theoretical, Donis stressed. But when researchers have tested flu
viruses in the lab, they found this particular mutation gave the
virus a better ability to attach to human-like cells.
A spokeswoman at the World Health Organization said there was no
evidence the mutation had much significance in making the virus
either more transmissible to people, or more or less dangerous to
them. "It doesn't look as if it has significance regarding
transmissibility or pathogenicity because it is not borne out by
epidemiological evidence we have so far," WHO spokeswoman Maria Cheng
said in Geneva.
Donis said similar mutations have been seen in H5N1, in Hong Kong in
2003, when it 1st re-emerged in people, and later in Viet Nam. "If
this was a wildfire mutation that would have caused the virus to
spread like wildfire in a population, we would have seen it more
often," he said.
The H5N1 virus remains largely a virus that affects birds. But all
influenza viruses mutate and evolve very easily, and regularly change
into what are known as pandemic strains, which spread rapidly around
the world, infecting and killing unusually large numbers of people.
There has not been a flu pandemic since 1968 and health experts feel
the world is overdue. The H5N1 virus, they say, resembles the H1N1
virus that apparently jumped from birds to humans in 1918, causing an
especially deadly pandemic before the virus evolved into a less
dangerous form and the human population built up an immunity to it.

[There are clear differences in opinion regarding the significance of
the minor differences in nucleotide sequence of the
haemagglutinin-encoding gene of the H5N1 avian influenza virus
recovered from patients in Turkey. The data reported are too
preliminary at this stage to allow any definitive conclusion about
potential evolution of the virus towards a form that would be easily
transmissible between humans. The epidemiological data are still
consistent with the assumption that transmission to humans is
entirely from diseased domestic poultry. - Mod.CP]
