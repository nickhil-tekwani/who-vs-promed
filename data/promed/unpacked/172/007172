The [number of] suspected cases of malaria imported from the Dominican Republic have risen to 19 in Puerto Rico, while the number of confirmed cases has reached 14, said the Minister of Health, Ana Rius.

Samples of the 19 suspected cases -- Puerto Ricans who visited Punta Cana in the Dominican East region -- are being analyzed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta [Georgia] in the United States.

"People returning from any country with malaria should be alert to symptoms of the disease within the first 2-4 weeks after the trip, and if there are symptoms, see your doctor for evaluation or treatment," said Rius.

The Minister recalled that malaria is eradicated in this Caribbean island, the only country besides Cuba that does not have that problem in the region [incorrect; see moderator's comment below].

Due to the health situation, on 20 Aug 2015 the Medical Sciences Campus of the University of Puerto Rico will hold a symposium, 'Malaria: current situation in Puerto Rico,' with the participation of eminent researchers. The expert Keith Carter, Senior Advisor on Malaria to the Pan American Health Organization, will attend.

Malaria is a disease transmitted by the bite of the Anopheles mosquito, and some of the areas at high malaria risk include Africa, Central and South America, and the Caribbean.

[Malaria in the Dominican Republic has previously been imported from Haiti. Punta Cana has also been a focus in previous outbreaks.

However, it is not correct that Cuba and Puerto Rico are the only countries in the Caribbean that are malaria free. Haiti is the only country with sustained malaria transmission, and all other countries in the region are considered malaria free.

However, over the past decade small outbreaks in the Dominican Republic have been reported (see list of ProMED reports below), and during the period 2006-2010 there was a large outbreak in Kingston, Jamaica, which also was believed to have originated from immigrants from Haiti.

If the 19 cases now reported from Puerto Rico were infected in the same area of the Dominican Republic, perhaps a new focus with sustained local (authothonous) transmission has been established.

Information from the Ministry of Health on the situation in the Dominican Republic will be greatly appreciated. - Mod.EP
