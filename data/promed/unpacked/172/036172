The DRC's Katanga Province continues to be affected by a cholera
epidemic that started in mid-December 2007. To date, about 19 health
zones out of 67 are affected. In 2007, the total population in the
affected communities was 9 629 888 people. Health Ministry and WHO
reports show that the epidemic is extending in many big cities of the
province. 110 deaths are reported out of more than 4000 cases
registered in Lubumbashi, Haut Lomami, Likasi, Tanganyika, and Haut Katanga.

According to the WHO, the DRC (especially in the East) is one of the
5 countries in the world where serious cholera epidemics have
periodically occurred (1981, 2002-2003, 2004, 2006, 2007-2008) in
Katanga, South Kivu and Eastern Kasai.

Arua District has registered 23 cases of cholera since the disease
broke out last week. The District Health Officer, Dr. Patrick Anguzu,
told Daily Monitor that 1 person had died. He said the disease has
spread to Oli Division where 16 cases have been reported.

According to the latest statistics, 7 cases have been reported within
the municipality. Dr. Anguzu attributed the outbreak to communities
using unclean water drawn especially from River Enyau. "The number of
latrines and water supply are insufficient. People are easing
themselves around the water points, while others fetch from them," he said.

Eight of Mozambique's 11 administrative provinces, including the city
of Maputo, have been hit by a cholera epidemic which has claimed 50
lives, state media reported on Wednesday [20 Feb 2008]. Health
minister Ivo Garrido was quoted by the daily Noticias as saying that
the spread of the disease worried health authorities.

Currently the provinces of Maputo, Maputo city, Manica, Sofala, Tete,
Cabo Delgado, Gaza and Zambezia have registered cases of the highly
contagious disease. Only the provinces of Inhambane, Niassa and
Nampula have not recorded any cases of cholera.

Health authorities attributed the spreading of the disease to poor
hygiene practices and the flooding in the central provinces.

At least 72 people have died of cholera and other intestinal diseases
brought on by floods that have ravaged central Mozambique since the
beginning of January 2008, medical staff said Tuesday [19 Feb 2008].

"Of the 450 cholera patients we have treated in areas affected by the
floods, 8 have died," global humanitarian organisation Doctors
without Borders said in a statement. "This figure is added to the 64
other deaths ... from diarrhea in the single village of Tete reported
by municipal authorities 2 weeks ago."

[Exactly where the cases are being reported from is not clear. The
following is taken from a ProMED posting about 1 month ago (Cholera,
diarrhea & dysentery update 2008 (05) 20080118.0227):

"Since the [cholera] outbreak began in November 2007, over 1000 cases
have been diagnosed, and over 80 percent of these are in Maputo and
Matola [in Maputo province]. The cholera treatment center for the 2
cities has been set up in Maputo's Mavalane hospital, which is seeing
between 5 and 10 new patients a day, said Garrido, cited in the
Tuesday [15 Jan 2008] issue of the Maputo daily "Noticias." However,
the situation in the southern province of Gaza is also becoming
alarming. The disease has been reported from the provincial capital
Xai-Xai, and the districts of Chokwe and Guija. Garrido said that
between 10 and 20 new cases are being reported every day."

Given this statement, one would think that there would be more than
450 cases overall. Maputo and Gaza provinces are located in the south
of the country. Cases were also reported from Manica in the central
part of the country, Tete in the northwest and Capo Delgado in the
northeast. The areas can be found on a map at
<http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/mozambiq.pdf>. The
outbreaks discussed in this update can also be found on the
