Norway has in the past years experienced an increasing incidence of
systemic disease caused by group B streptococci (GBS, _Streptococcus
agalactiae_) as monitored by notifications of positive blood culture and
spinal fluid specimens to Norway's Meldingssystem for smittsomme sykdommer
(MSIS) at Statens institutt for folkehelse (National Institute of Public
Health, NIPH). This epidemiological development parallels that of systemic
group A streptococcal (GAS, _S. pyogenes_) disease and systemic
pneumococcal (_S. pneumoniae_) disease (1-4). Norway's notification system
is a 2-channel statutory system that combines clinical and laboratory
notifications in one database. In 2000, there were 145 cases of systemic
GBS disease, corresponding to an overall incidence of 3.2 per 100 000
population, compared with 1986 when there were 11 cases and a corresponding
incidence of 0.3/100 000.
Of the 145 cases, 63 (43%) were in male patients and 81 (56%) in female
patients, with one case (1%) where no information about sex was available.
Of these cases, 142 (98%) were admitted to hospital. The mean age was 35
years, the median age 29 years (range 0 days to 93 years). A total of 39
(27%) patients had onset of disease on the first day after birth.
Altogether 59 cases (41%) were younger than 90 days of age at the time of
onset. At the other end of the age range, 20 cases (14%) were notified
among patients aged 80 years or older. In the older age categories, as
expected, many patients had predisposing conditions such as diabetes,
cancer, or immunosuppressive treatment. In the group aged 10-19 years, only
one case was notified. In all, 9 deaths (8%) were notified, 5 among
newborns <1 day, and 4 in people aged 70, 77, 84, and 93 years. The 50
cases in the early-onset group (age 0-7 days) corresponds to one in 1000
newborns (Norway has about 50 000 live births per year). The late onset
group had 9 cases (0.2/1000).
There was no clear seasonal variation. In some hospitals in the past
decade, chlorhexidine has been applied topically to women giving birth.
Antibiotics are given only on individual indications. In other countries
antibiotics such as ampicillin are used systematically, according to
national policy. Some Norwegian hospitals report comparatively low levels
of systemic GBS disease in the obstetrics and gynecology wards. On a
national level there is, however, a marked increase. The reasons for this
increase are not known, as the laboratories have not changed their routine
notification systems for systemic GBS between 1986 and 2000, nor have blood
culture media improved or policies changed radically about what patients a
sample should be taken from. The reasons therefore deserve further
investigation.
