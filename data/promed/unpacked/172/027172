In a follow-up to the hepatitis E outbreak in Bocaranga-Koui Health District, Central African Republic, since late October 2018, 67 new cases of acute jaundice syndrome were reported, of which 51 were confirmed with hepatitis E virus infection. As of 23 Nov 2018, a total of 119 cases of acute jaundice syndrome were recorded, including 2 deaths (case fatality ratio, 1.7%). Of the 119 cases, 80 (67%) have been confirmed positive for hepatitis E virus infection by the Institut Pasteur Bangui. The outbreak has largely been localized to Bocaranga City.

The outbreak of hepatitis E was declared by the Minister of Health on 2 Oct 2018. Epidemiological investigation revealed that the 1st suspected cases emerged in July 2018. Health officials report an increasing trend being observed lately.

Hepatitis E infection is found worldwide. The virus is shed in the stools of infected persons and enters the human body through the intestine. It is transmitted mainly through contaminated drinking water. Usually the infection is self-limiting and resolves within 2 to 6 weeks. Occasionally a serious disease, known as fulminant hepatitis (acute liver failure) develops, and a proportion of people with this disease can die [especially pregnant women - Mod.LL].

According to WHO, every year, there are an estimated 20 million hepatitis E infections worldwide, leading to an estimated 3.3 million symptomatic cases of hepatitis E, and 56 600 hepatitis E-related deaths.

[Hepatitis E is found worldwide, and different genotypes of the hepatitis E virus determine differences in epidemiology. For example, genotype 1 is usually seen in developing countries and causes community-level outbreaks, whereas genotype 3 is usually seen in developed countries and does not cause outbreaks. Acute epidemic hepatitis E is attributable to infection with hepatitis E virus genotypes 1 and 2. Many of the deaths are in pregnant women, characteristic of genotype 1.

The highest seroprevalence rates (number of persons in a population who test positive for the disease) are observed in regions where low standards of sanitation increase the risk for transmission of the virus.

Ouham-Pende is one of the 16 prefectures of the Central African Republic (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouham-Pend%C3%A9). Located in the west of the country, its capital is Bozoum. In the north it has a border with Cameroun and Chad. In the south is the prefecture Ombella-Mpoko; in the southwest, the prefecture Nana-Mambere; and in the east, the prefecture Ouham. - Mod.LL
