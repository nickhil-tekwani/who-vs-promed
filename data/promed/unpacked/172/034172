A 49-year-old man died from rabies in the Lipetsk region. This happened in May [2015], but laboratory data confirming the cause of death, came only yesterday [6 Aug 2015]. According to the local Department of Rospotrebnadzor [Federal Service for Consumer Protection and Human Welfare], the dangerous virus was brought into the house by a cat.

The cat had gone missing from home for several days. When she returned, the man decided to wash it. "In the process of washing the man was bitten by the cat," explained Irina Shchukin, the Deputy Head of Department. Most likely, the animal was infected by a rabid fox.

Delay in seeking medical aid was fatal for the man. Let us recall that this year [2015] this is already the 2nd case of the death of a resident of this region from rabies. In March [2015], a 15-year-old schoolgirl from the city of Yelets died after being bitten by a puppy, which was bought at the local animal market.

[Sporadic cases of human rabies in Russia are registered annually. In 2013, there were 6 such cases, in 2014 there were 3. Over the past few years the worst affected were the Central and southern Federal districts. Cases of rabies in humans are directly associated with epizootically unfavorable conditions with rabies in several regions of Russia, and not all of the population seeks medical care after contact with wild and domestic animals with suspicion of rabies. So, 172 cases of [animal] rabies were identified in the Lipetsk region in the 1st 7 months of this year (2015). This is almost double the number of the year before. Cases of rabies are observed in all areas in the region. The main source of infection is the red fox (83 cases); 85 cases were identified in domestic animals (cats, dogs, cattle) and 4 in raccoon dogs http://gorod48.ru/news/333047/ (in Russian). - Mod.NP

Lipetsk is a small oblast to the east of the Ukrainian border; see http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/commonwealth/russiaaddivisions.jpg.

There has been a very successful oral rabies vaccination (ORV) programme along the border with Finland and in other areas, funded by the EU. Clearly, it needs to be applied elsewhere clearly. A report on the ORV programme in Estonia is enlightening:

Eliminating rabies in Estonia
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3289618/ Accessed 9 Sep 2015

Abstract
--------
The compulsory vaccination of pets, the recommended vaccination of farm animals in grazing areas and the extermination of stray animals did not succeed in eliminating rabies in Estonia because the virus was maintained in 2 main wildlife reservoirs, foxes and raccoon dogs. These 2 species became a priority target therefore in order to control rabies. Supported by the European Community, successive oral vaccination (OV) campaigns were conducted twice a year using Rabigen(R) SAG2 baits, beginning in autumn 2005 in North Estonia. They were then extended to the whole territory from spring 2006. Following the vaccination campaigns, the incidence of rabies cases dramatically decreased, with 266 cases in 2005, 114 in 2006, 4 in 2007, and 3 in 2008. Since March 2008, no rabies cases have been detected in Estonia other than 3 cases reported in summer 2009 and one case in January 2011, all in areas close to the south eastern border with Russia. The bait uptake was satisfactory, with tetracycline positivity rates ranging from 85 percent to 93 percent in foxes and from 82 percent to 88 percent in raccoon dogs. Immunisation rates evaluated by ELISA ranged from 34 percent to 55 percent in foxes and from 38 percent to 55 percent in raccoon dogs. The rabies situation in Estonia was compared to that of the other 2 Baltic States, Latvia and Lithuania. Despite regular OV campaigns conducted throughout their territory since 2006, and an improvement in the epidemiological situation, rabies has still not been eradicated in these countries. An analysis of the number of baits distributed and the funding allocated by the European Commission showed that the strategy for rabies control is more cost-effective in Estonia than in Latvia and Lithuania.

Note that the compulsory vaccination of pets and livestock was unsuccessful in eliminating rabies because of its reservoir in wild foxes and raccoon dogs.

For the Characterization of Russian rabies virus vaccine strain RV-97, see http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170207004492

Abstract
--------
The RV-97 rabies virus vaccine strain is widely used in Russia as a component of the live attenuated oral anti-rabies vaccine "Sinrab". This vaccine has also been used in some other countries, such as Kazakhstan, Belarus, and Ukraine. Entire genome sequencing is an effective tool for studying the genetic properties of virus strains. In this study, a simple technique for obtaining the entire genome sequence of the rabies virus was used. The entire genome sequence and the deduced amino acid sequences of the major viral proteins were compared with those of other rabies vaccine virus strains. The RV-97 strain forms a separate phylogenetic branch and seems to be phylogenetically more related to the group of Japanese vaccine strains. It also contains several unique amino acid changes in known immunodominant sites of G and P proteins.
