Yellow fever in Cote d'Ivoire
-----------------------------
19 Oct 2006
On 5 Oct 2006, the Ministry of Health reported 2 cases of yellow fever in
the towns of Korhogo and Ouaragahio in Cote d'Ivoire. The cases, a
30-year-old man in Korhogo and a 16-year-old girl in Ouaragahio, are
laboratory confirmed (IgM Elisa assay) by the Institut Pasteur, Abidjan,
Cote d'Ivoire and by the regional reference laboratory, Institut Pasteur,
Dakar, Senegal. To date, no fatalities have been reported.
The Ministry of Health, supported by WHO, has sent a multidisciplinary team
including a virologist, an epidemiologist and an entomologist to
investigate both outbreaks. As a result, surveillance activities have been
intensified and a vaccination campaign is planned for the affected areas.
The Ministry of Health has asked the international community for funds to
launch this campaign and has also requested vaccines from the International
Coordinating Group (ICG) on Vaccine Provision for Yellow Fever.

[One hopes that the multidisciplinary team is able to assess the situation
and operate surveillance and vaccination efforts in both the
government-controlled and in rebel-held territories. - Mod.TY]
