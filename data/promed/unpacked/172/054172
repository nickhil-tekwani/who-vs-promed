South Australia is experiencing its worst whooping cough [pertussis]
outbreak on record and babies are the main victims of the potentially fatal
and highly infectious disease. Babies are most vulnerable as they are too
young to be [fully] immunized, and rely upon "herd immunity", the high
immunisation of those around them.

SA Health has received almost 3500 reports in 2009, compared with 859 at
the same time in 2008 and 318 in 2007. National statistics show the rate in
South Australia is twice as high as the national average. A 4 week old NSW
baby who died in March 2009 was the 1st fatality from the disease in a
decade. Since then it is understood 2 other children have died.

SA Health Communicable Disease Control branch director Dr Ann Koehler said
nationally there had been a "big wave" of infections. She said SA had the
highest rate, although it was not clear why. Dr Koehler said more cases
were being diagnosed as people were tested for swine flu. She said SA had
recorded the highest number of notifications since records started being
kept in 1991, and warned that people needed to be vigilant about
vaccinations to protect vulnerable children.

"The highest rates of infection we're seeing are children who are too young
to be vaccinated," Dr Koehler said. "With children, brain damage can be a
really serious complication. While they're trying to cough, they stop
breathing. Little children also get hernias and might need surgery to fix
that."

About 95 per cent of SA children are immunized, but Dr Koehler said SA
Health was concerned about some people's resistance to or complacency about
vaccinating children. She warned homeopathic "vaccines" did not work.
"That's wasting your money ... you're putting yourself, your children and
other people's children at risk," she said.

[In assessing the durability of pertussis vaccination in children, some
researchers noted that "Reported cases and outbreaks in older children and
young adults may reflect a less durable vaccine-induced protection than
seen in natural disease (Cherry JD, Brunell PA, Golden GA, Karzon, DT.
Report of the task force on pertussis and pertussis immunization - 1988.
Pediatrics 1988; 81(June Suppl): 955). The duration of protection has
varied in several studies, depending on the epidemiological setting; that
is, prevalence of natural disease as well as the vaccine product used. A
study in Michigan showed an efficacy of 80 per cent 3 years after the last
dose, 50 per cent between 4 and 7 years, and virtually none after 12 years.
Breakthrough disease noted in this study was usually mild."

Because of these and similar findings, it is now recommended to reimmunize
teenagers and give adults between 19 and 64 year old a TdaP [tetanus, low
dose diphtheria, acellular pertussis] booster substituted for one of the
every 10 year Td vaccines [detailed adult immunisation practices vary
worldwide. - Mod.SH]. - Mod.LL
