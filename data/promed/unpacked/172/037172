- Yellow rust is expected to affect China's wheat output around spring next year [2020], after the disease spreads to key production areas across the eastern and northwest regions.

- Yellow rust was detected in Gansu, Ningxia, and Shaanxi provinces around October and November [2019], affecting seedlings across 510 685 acres, an area 3 times larger than the previous year [2018], the National Agricultural Technology Promotional Center said.

- The affected provinces witnessed a more severe outbreak compared with previous years.

- According to a forecast by China's Meteorological department, the temperature in the eastern and central wheat-producing regions is slightly higher compared with last year [2018]. This is conducive to [reproduction] of yellow rust in winter.

- Farmers should strengthen their monitoring and prevent and control the disease.

[Stripe rust (also called yellow rust) of cereals is caused by the fungus _Puccinia striiformis_. The disease affects wheat (_Triticum aestivum_), durum wheat (_T. turgidum_), some barley varieties, triticale (wheat/rye hybrids), and a number of wild grasses. It causes yellow stripes on leaves, which leads to loss of photosynthetic ability and plant vigour as well as stunting of plants. Yield losses of 40-100% have been reported in wheat.

Spores are wind dispersed in several cycles during the cropping season. Grasses and volunteer crop plants may generate a "green bridge," providing inoculum for the next crop cycle. Disease monitoring is important so that timely action can be taken to limit the spread of the pathogen as well as build-up of inoculum. Disease management may include the use of resistant varieties, fungicide applications, and control of pathogen reservoirs. Monitoring and resistance breeding programmes have been established in different regions for early detection of new rust strains and to attempt to stay ahead of pathogen evolution.

While stem rust (_P. graminis_) poses a huge potential threat to world wheat production, stripe rust is currently causing the most damage to wheat crops on a global scale. New strains of both rusts with increased virulence and additional fungicide resistances have been reported in recent years from wheat-growing areas worldwide. Climate warming allowing survival of wheat rusts on green bridges into higher latitudes is another example of pathogens extending their range due to climate change (see also ProMED-mail posts 20141024.2895414, 20120809.1235745, 20090914.3230, 20110718.2172). Projects for double-resistance breeding to manage both stripe and stem rusts simultaneously are in progress (see ProMED-mail post 20120831.1274190).
