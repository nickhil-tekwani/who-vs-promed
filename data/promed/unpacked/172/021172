Chikungunya Fever in Maldive Islands
------------------------------------
Two travellers, a father (35 years of age) and his son (7 years of
age) returning from a 10-day trip to the Maldive Islands presented on
14 September [2009], 4 days after their return, at the Department of
Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine of the University of Munich
with high fever, rash, and arthritis of small joints, mainly
affecting fingers and wrists. Laboratory investigations showed
leucocytopenia, mild hepatitis and normal thrombocyte counts in both
patients. The wife of the traveller, also travelling with her husband
and her son did not show any symptoms.

Virological testing of blood samples for dengue and chikungunya virus
by real-time-RT-PCR was positive for chikungunya and negative for
dengue. Molecular characterization is ongoing.

The travellers had direct flights from Germany to the Maldive Islands
and vice-versa, and did not stay in chikungunya-endemic areas before
or after this trip. To our knowledge these are the 1st reported
chikungunya fever cases on the Maldive islands since January 2009
when an outbreak of chikungunya fever was presumed to occur on the
Laamu Atoll (ProMED-mail 20090114.0150).

The results imply an ongoing transmission on the Maldives or a new
introduction of chikungunya virus to the islands. Travellers should
be advised to apply prophylactic measures such as protection from
mosquito bites.

[There was a suspected outbreak of chikungunya virus infection on the
Maldive Islands in December 2008, extending into January 2009. There
were no reports of laboratory confirmation of the etiological
agent(s) involved in that outbreak (see ProMED archive number
20090114.0150). The 2 German cases reported by Prof. Loscher and Drs.
Hanus, Dobler and Wolfel provide definitive evidence of ongoing
chikungunya virus transmission in the Maldive Islands, and ProMED
thanks them for sending in this report. Fortunately, there is little
possibility of ongoing transmission in the Munich area, so
epidemiologically, these are dead-end cases. ProMED would appreciate
receiving further reports of chikungunya virus infections on the
Maldive Islands.
