French authorities are investigating almost 50 _Salmonella_ infections linked to eating raw or undercooked horse meat in the past few months.

During this summer, Sante publique France identified 20 patients that are part of a cluster of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Newport cases. A total of 28 other people were linked to a 2nd cluster of salmonellosis caused by a different serotype known as monophasic _S._ Typhimurium (1, 4, [5], 12:i:-).

In France, there is a tradition of consuming raw or rare horse meat, especially in the form of minced (ground) meat, according to the directorate general for food (DGAL) and directorate general for health (DGS). However, consumption of horse meat has decreased significantly in France in recent decades.

Surveys of patients enabled health authorities to identify the role in illness of horse meat, consumed raw or undercooked, in particular in the form of ground meat. Outlets mentioned by interviewed patients were informed of the issue and reminded of good hygiene practices for preparing ground meat.

Authorities of some identified horse-meat-producing countries have also been informed so they can carry out checks. Horse meat is mainly imported from Italy, Romania, Poland, the United States, or South America, but there is some domestic production.

Health authorities said it was important, especially during hot weather, to respect the cold chain, particularly by consumers after purchase, and to consume meat quickly, ideally the same day as purchase. Places where meat is chopped after a request by consumers, such as butchers, were advised to remain vigilant on the sanitary quality of supplies as well as meat sold by carrying out regular bacteriological checks.

A _Salmonella_ Bovismorbificans outbreak linked to horse meat from Romania via Belgium sickened 25 in France in 2019 with 9 people needing hospital treatment. It was the latest in a string of illnesses linked to consumption of horse meat in recent years. Other outbreaks in 2003, 2006, and 2010 involved _Salmonella_ Newport, _S._ Meleagridis, and _S._ Typhimurium. In 2018, a _S._ Enteritidis outbreak in France was suspected to be caused by chilled horse meat from Belgium, processed in Romania, with raw material from Hungary.

[Although not often considered as a source of salmonellosis, equines can certainly be on the menu of zoonoses for this pathogen as shown by the following report:

Jay-Russell MT, Madigan JE, Bengson Y, et al.: _Salmonella_ Oranienburg isolated from horses, wild turkeys, and an edible home garden fertilized with raw horse manure. Zoonoses Public Health. 2014; 61(1):64-71; https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/zph.12043.

Summary
--------
In July 2010, a horse from a rural farm (Farm A) in coastal Northern California was diagnosed with _Salmonella_ Oranienburg infection following referral to a veterinary hospital for colic surgery. Environmental sampling to identify potential sources and persistence of _Salmonella_ on the farm was conducted from August 2010 to March 2011. _Salmonella_ was cultured using standard enrichment and selective plating. Pure colonies were confirmed by biochemical analysis, serotyped, and compared by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis. A total of 204 clinical and environmental samples at Farm A were analyzed, and _Salmonella_ spp. were isolated from 6 of 8 (75%) horses, an asymptomatic pet dog, 2 of 7 (28.6%) water samples from horse troughs, 9 of 20 (45%) manure storage pile composites, 16 of 71 (22.5%) wild turkey feces, and 4 of 39 (10.3%) soil samples from the family's edible home garden. Well water and garden vegetable samples and horse fecal samples from a neighboring ranch were negative. _S._ Oranienburg with a PFGE pattern indistinguishable from the horse clinical strain was found in all positive sample types on Farm A. The investigation illustrates the potential for widespread dissemination of _Salmonella_ in a farm environment following equine infections. We speculate that a recent surge in the wild turkey population on the property could have introduced _S._ Oranienburg into the herd, although we cannot rule out the possibility wild turkeys were exposed on the farm or to other potential sources of _Salmonella_. Findings from the investigation indicated that raw horse manure applied as fertilizer was the most likely source of garden soil contamination. Viable _S._ Oranienburg persisted in garden soil for an estimated 210 days, which exceeds the 120-day standard between application and harvest currently required by the National Organic Program. The study underscores the need to educate the public about potential food safety hazards associated with using raw animal manure to fertilize edible home gardens.
