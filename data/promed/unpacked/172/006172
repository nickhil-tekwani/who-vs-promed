The U.K. National Audit Office was cited as saying today that the cost of
clearing up Britain's mad-cow crisis is set to top $5.5 billion, and that
it could take until 2003 to incinerate huge stocks of meat, bone meal and
tallow from cattle slaughtered because they were judged at risk from the
disease.
Since March 1996, over 1.35 million cattle have been put to death under one
cull scheme, affecting those over 30 months old.
The report said total spending on tackling the disease, compensating
farmers and paying slaughterhouses, renderers and other professionals was
almost 1.5 billion pounds ($2.5 billion) in 1996-7, of which 800 million
pounds would come from the European Union.
It forecast additional spending between 1997 and 2000 at 1.9 billion
pounds, taking the total to 3.4 billion pounds ($5.5 billion).
