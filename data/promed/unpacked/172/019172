UNEXPLAINED DEATHS, RABBITS - RUSSIA: RFI

SOUTHERN RUSSIA AND VOLGA REGION
---------------------------------
Last year an epidemic of West Nile virus in Volgograd that killed 34 and
hospitalized 700, and a similar epidemic in the Oblivskoy district of the
Rostov region, diagnosed as Congo-Crimean, may have been West Nile as well.
Despite assurances of regional "san-epid" officials in both Rostov and
Volgograd regions that the epidemics are not repeating themselves, the
local press has reported the first cases in Volgograd and Rostov.
A computer expert in Oblivskoy, Viktor Skidan, who broke through regional
officials' news blockade about last year's epidemic in Oblivskoy (and lost
his job for it), reports that rabbits are dying. Some of them are bleeding
from their eyes, and they become as stiff as wood within 5 minutes after
death. It is said that hospital officials are uneasy, and that in analyses
of those who were sick last year something has appeared again.
