FOOT AND MOUTH DISEASE IN TAIPEI CHINA
Virus isolation in cattle (follow-up report)
See also: 18 June 1999, 16 January 1998
Follow-up report No. 1
Text of a fax received on 28 June 1999 from Dr Watson H.T. Sung, Deputy
Director General, Bureau of Animal and Plant Inspection and Quarantine,
Council of Agriculture, Taipei:
End of previous report period: 11 June 1999 (see Disease Information, 12
[23, 84, dated 18 June 1999).
End of this report period: 25 June 1999.
New outbreaks:
Location No. of outbreaks
Kinmen prefecture 3 cattle farms
Tainan prefecture 3 cattle farms
(on Taiwan island)
Total number of animals in the new outbreaks:
species bov
susceptible 416
cases 0*
deaths 0
destroyed 416
slaughtered 0
* no cattle showed clinical signs of FMD.
Diagnosis: tests on paired sera gave positive results.
A. Laboratory where diagnosis was made: Taiwan Animal Health Research
Institute.
B. Diagnostic tests used: virus isolation, virus neutralisation test and
ELISA.
C. Causal agent: virus type O. According to the result of the DNA sequence
analysis, the strain, of bovine origin, is different from OTaiwan (pig
adapted strain). The points of similarity of the DNA sequence of the FMD
virus from two of the affected farms in Tainan were 99.6% and 98.8%,
respectively, compared with the previous isolate from Kinmen.
Mode of spread: cattle from Kinmen had been shipped to Taiwan island and
slaughtered for sale in the local markets before the FMD virus was detected
in cattle in Kinmen.
Control measures during reporting period:
- stamping out: all cattle in the affected farms were destroyed;
- ban on the transportation of livestock and related products from Kinmen
to Taiwan and other islands;
- the meat market in Tainan was closed temporarily, and all cattle, goats,
deer and pigs were re-vaccinated within a 6-km radius of the three affected
farms in Tainan;

[The report to OIE finishes with a semi-colon. If there was more, it was
not posted. The present outbreak is thus clearly not a continuation of the
earlier problem in pigs. Let us hope that this preemptive contact slaughter
was effective. It will be interesting to see whether the Kinmen FMDv is
similar to Fujian FMDv. - MHJ
