Uganda has confirmed its first death from Ebola virus since 2019, declaring an outbreak in the central Mubende district after one person died of the highly contagious virus, the country's health ministry said on Tuesday [20 Sep 2022]. The WHO has said 6 other deaths in the area are being investigated.

Health authorities reported that a man in the central Mubende district, who died on Monday [19 Sep 2022], had tested positive for the virus.

"The confirmed case is a 24-year-old male [...] who presented with EVD symptoms and later succumbed," the health ministry said in a statement on Twitter on [Tue 20 Sep 2022], using an abbreviation for the disease.

The World Health Organization's (WHO) Africa office said in a statement that the case was of the relatively rare Sudan strain. "This is the first time in more than a decade that Uganda is recording the Ebola Sudan strain," WHO Africa Director Matshidiso Moeti said.

The case was confirmed after 6 suspicious deaths that have occurred in the district this month [September 2022] were investigated by the National Rapid Response team, the WHO said.

"There are currently 8 suspected cases receiving care in a health facility," it added.

The global health body said that it was helping Uganda's health authorities with their probe and deploying staff to the affected area.

Ebola is an often deadly viral haemorrhagic fever. The virus was first identified in Central Africa in 1976. It spreads by contact with bodily fluids of an infected person or contaminated materials. Symptoms of the disease include fever, vomiting, diarrhea, muscle pain and sometimes internal and external bleeding.

Uganda has witnessed multiple outbreaks of the Ebola virus with the most recent one in 2019 that left at least 5 people dead.

The country also shares a porous border with the Democratic Republic of Congo, which recorded a new Ebola case last month [August 2022] less than 6 weeks after an epidemic in its northwest was declared over.

[The concern is how well or whether the ERVEBO vaccine will protect against the Sudan strain, since it was designed against the Zaire strain. ERVEBOÂ® (Ebola Zaire Vaccine, Live also known as V920, rVSVÎ"G-ZEBOV-GP or rVSV-ZEBOV) is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the prevention of disease caused by Zaire ebolavirus. ERVEBO is a replication-competent, live, attenuated recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV) vaccine manufactured by Merck.

"Uganda is no stranger to effective Ebola control. Thanks to its expertise, action has quickly detect the virus, and we can bank on this knowledge to halt the spread of infections," Matshidiso Moeti, the WHO Africa's regional director, said.

"The WHO said there had been 7 previous outbreaks of the Ebola Sudan strain, 4 in Uganda and 3 in Sudan. It said Uganda last reported an outbreak of Ebola Sudan strain in 2012 and an outbreak of the Ebola Zaire strain in 2019. Case fatality rates of the Sudan virus have varied from 41 to 100% in past outbreaks, the global health agency added.

"It noted ring vaccination of high-risk people with the Ervebo vaccine had been highly effective in controlling the spread of Ebola in recent outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and elsewhere but that this vaccine had only been approved to protect against the Zaire strain.

"First identified in 1976 in the DRC (then Zaire), the virus, whose natural host is the bat, has since set off a series of epidemics in Africa, killing some 15 000 people". (https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/9/20/uganda-confirms-ebola-outbreak-after-patient-dies)

"Abstract.
"Studies of 3 outbreaks of Ebola hemorrhagic fever in Zaire and Sudan have shown that human mortality resulting from Zaire strains of Ebola virus was 90% while that resulting from Sudan strains was 55%-65%. Zaire strains were much easier to isolate in cell culture than all of the Sudanese agents; also, fewer than 10 infectious particles of a Zaire strain were lethal for suckling mice, whereas 10 000 infectious particles of a Sudan strain failed to kill any of these animals. These biologic data indicate that these antigenically related viruses are different, a conclusion supported by genetic, biochemical, and immunologic data."

Vaccines (Basel). 2022 Aug 5;10(8):1263. doi: 10.3390/vaccines10081263. PMID: 36016151; PMCID: PMC9412258.

"Abstract. The Marburg virus (MARV) and Sudan virus (SUDV) belong to the filovirus family. The sporadic human outbreaks occur mostly in Africa and are characterized by an aggressive disease course with high mortality. The first case of Marburg virus disease in Guinea in 2021, together with the increased frequency of outbreaks of Ebola virus (EBOV), which is also a filovirus, accelerated the interest in potential prophylactic vaccine solutions against multiple filoviruses. We previously tested a 2-dose heterologous vaccine regimen (Ad26.Filo, MVA-BN-Filo) in non-human primates (NHP) and showed a fully protective immune response against both SUDV and MARV in addition to the already-reported protective effect against EBOV. The vaccine-induced glycoprotein (GP)-binding antibody levels appear to be good predictors of the NHP challenge outcome as indicated by the correlation between antibody levels and survival outcome as well as the high discriminatory capacity of the logistic model. Moreover, the elicited GP-specific binding antibody response against EBOV, SUDV, and MARV remains stable for more than 1 year. Overall, the NHP data indicate that the Ad26.Filo, MVA-BN-Filo regimen may be a good candidate for a prophylactic vaccination strategy in regions at high risk of filovirus outbreaks." - Mod.LK]

[2] WHO: Antivirals

The World Health Organization (WHO) has published its first guideline for Ebola virus therapies, with new strong recommendations for the use of 2 monoclonal antibodies.

In its guidelines published [Fri 16 Sep 2022], the WHO has called on countries to improve access to 2 life-saving drugs against viral diseases. The recommendation follows a review and analysis of clinical studies for the monoclonal antibodies mAb114 (known as Ansuvimab or Ebanga) and REGN-EB3 (Inmazeb), which have shown clear benefits for people who have tested positive for Ebola, which is often fatal.

The clinical trials were conducted during Ebola outbreaks. The WHO said the largest trial was conducted in the Democratic Republic of Congo, demonstrating that the highest level of scientific rigor can be applied even during Ebola outbreaks in difficult contexts.

The UN agency has also made recommendations regarding therapies that should not be used as treatment, including ZMapp and remdesivir.

Ebola is a serious and too often fatal disease caused by the Ebola virus. Past Ebola outbreaks and responses have shown that early diagnosis and treatment with optimized supportive care - with fluid and electrolyte replenishment and treatment of symptoms - significantly improve survival.

"Now, following a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials of therapies for the disease, the WHO has made strong recommendations for 2 monoclonal antibody treatments: mAb114 (Ansuvimab; Ebanga) and REGN-EB3 (Inmazeb)," the WHO said in a statement.

Developed according to WHO standards and methodologies for guidelines, and published simultaneously in English and French, the guidelines will support healthcare providers caring for patients with Ebola, and policy makers involved in outbreak preparedness and response.

According to the WHO, the new guideline complements the clinical care guidelines that outline the optimized supportive care that Ebola patients should receive, from the relevant tests to be administered, to the management of pain, nutrition and co-infections. and other approaches that put the patient on the best path to recovery.

"This therapeutic guide is a critical tool to fight Ebola," said Dr. Richard Kojan, co-chair of the Guideline Development Group of experts selected by WHO and chair of ALIMA, The Alliance for International Medical Action. "It will help reassure communities, health professionals and patients that this life-threatening disease can be treated with effective drugs. From now on, people infected with the Ebola virus have a greater chance of recovering if they seek care like Net as with other infectious diseases, timeliness is essential, and people should not hesitate to consult health professionals as soon as possible to ensure they receive the best possible care."

While the WHO was able to make strong recommendations for the use of 2 therapies, it aslo said there is a need for further research and evaluation of clinical interventions as there are still many uncertainties.
