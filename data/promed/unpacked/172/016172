West Nile virus spreads into Union County
-----------------------------------------
West Nile virus has been blamed for the deaths of 6 more crows, bringing to
15 the number of birds in 4 New Jersey counties found stricken with the
disease, officials said yesterday. For the first time, Union County joined
the list of West Nile virus hot spots as officials confirmed two crows
found in Elizabeth and Rahway were among the latest to produce positive
blood samples in a state laboratory. 3 of the crows were found in Bergen
County, the fourth in Sayreville in Middlesex County.
"I'm not surprised. We don't live in a bubble. They have been finding them
all around us," said Carolyn Vollero, the chief inspector for Union County
Mosquito Control. She noted the proximity of Elizabeth to Staten Island,
where dead crows have also tested positive. Vollero said the county would
continue it's ground spraying and other mosquito-control efforts, but
insisted there would be no conversion to the kind of aerial spraying taking
place in residential neighborhoods of New York City. "We don't need to
press the panic button," she said.
The 3 new Bergen County sites where crows tested positive were Bergenfield,
Hasbrouck Heights and Old Tappan. 10 of the 15 birds shown to be infected
have been recovered in Bergen, officials say. One bird collected in Hudson
County tested positive last month. "It's only a matter of time before we're
testing positive across the board in Bergen County," said Rod Preiss, the
health officer for the Northwest Bergen Regional Health Commission. The
commission covers 7 towns, including Old Tappan and Montvale, where a dead
crow previously tested positive.
More than two dozen people have been tested for suspected West Nile virus
infections. Not one has tested positive, state officials say. There have
also been no reports in New Jersey of infected mosquitoes.
