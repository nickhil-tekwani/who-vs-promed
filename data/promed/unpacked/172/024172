Bulgarian response to poliomyelitis caused by imported wild poliovirus
----------------------------------------------------------------------
In May this year, Eurosurveillance Weekly reported on the occurrence of 2
cases of poliomyelitis in Bulgaria (1) [see also the ProMED-mail references
above. These cases were important because they were the first of the
disease in Bulgaria since 1991 and in Europe since 1998, and might
therefore have constituted a setback for the World Health Organization
(WHO) European Region, which was on track for certification of polio
eradication (2). The patients ­- 2 children of Romany origin ­- were
infected with a wild poliovirus closely related to a strain isolated from
India in July 2000. After the virus had been identified, Bulgarias health
ministry initiated contact tracing, screening of children at high risk
(children from particularly vulnerable communities or living in nearby
areas), a retrospective review of records, intensified surveillance for
acute flaccid paralysis, and a mass vaccination campaign (3).
Between 28 Apr and 22 May 2001, stool specimens were obtained from 117
children at high risk of exposure, who had been admitted to hospital in 9
different districts. Children who had been on the same ward as one of the
cases and the household contacts of both cases were also screened. Wild
type Human poliovirus 1 was found in 2 of the children screened ­- the
sibling of one of these had shared the hospital ward with the first case -­
but neither child showed symptoms of poliomyelitis. Further stool specimens
were collected from 244 children countrywide after an outbreak of viral
meningitis due to Echovirus 30 between June and August 2001. Although 7
children carried a vaccine-derived virus, none was found with a wild virus.
A final survey of 155 high-risk children aged <3 years in 10 district
hospitals was conducted between 23 Aug and 11 Sep 2001. No wild
polioviruses were detected.
To control the outbreak, a regional mass vaccination campaign was launched
on 19 Apr 2001. A national vaccination campaign of 2 rounds with the goal
of vaccinating all 468 720 children aged 0-6 years was conducted during the
periods 28 May-1 Jun and 25-29 Jun 2001. Administrative estimates of
coverage suggest that 94% of all children in the country were vaccinated
during the first round and 95% during the second. Because the initial
contact tracing showed that up to half of the children from high-risk
groups were not fully vaccinated by the routine program, 2 additional
rounds of mass vaccination are planned for children aged 0-4 years at high
risk during October and November 2001.
This outbreak illustrates the occurrence of transmission over several
months of a wild poliovirus imported into a country that had been free of
poliomyelitis for almost 10 years. The outbreak occurred because a virus
was imported into Bulgaria from an unknown source and infected population
subgroups with low immunity. High coverage reported for the campaign
nationwide, improved performance of surveillance for acute flaccid
paralysis, and the absence of wild polioviruses in subsequent stool surveys
of children at high risk suggest that circulation of the wild virus has
been interrupted.
Population groups with lower vaccination coverage can sustain the
circulation of wild polioviruses in a country for several years, and
communities at high risk can be found in all European countries. After wild
poliovirus type 1 was confirmed in the Bulgarian cases, the WHO Regional
Office for Europe immediately informed authorities in all member states and
requested them to improve surveillance for acute flaccid paralysis and
vaccination coverage in vulnerable subgroups of the population who may be
hard to reach.
