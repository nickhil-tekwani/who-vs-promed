Because West Nile virus (WNV) has become endemic in North America,
and cases can be expected to occur throughout the virus transmission
season, ProMED-mail will be reporting only newly detected virus and
human cases in the US states and Canadian provinces for the current
reporting period. Those wishing to see the complete summary for virus
detection in birds, mosquitoes, sentinel animals, and equines, as
well as a breakdown of human disease cases for 2008, can access that
information on the following sites:

Human cases: no new reports after 18 Oct 2008
Wild birds: no new reports after 4 Nov 2008
Equine cases for the year: no new reports after 18 Oct 2008
Mosquito pools positive for WNV: no new reports after 8 Oct 2008

[Apparently the West Nile virus transmission season has ended in
Canada for 2008, since there are no new reports available. - Mod.TY]

[2] USA
Date: 5-18 Nov 2008


States newly reporting WNV detected: none
(The only states not reporting WNV presence in 2008 are: Alaska,
Hawaii, and Maine).
States newly reporting human cases: none
There have been a total of 1301 human cases and 34 fatalities to date
in 2008 in the USA.
States reporting equine WNV infections for the 1st time in 2008
during the period 21 Oct-10 Nov 2008: Pennsylvania and Tennessee
A total of 138 equine cases have been reported nationally in 2008.
[All equine cases are unfortunate, as a veterinary vaccine is
available. - Mod.TY]

CHPPM-North District of Columbia Area WNV Mosquito Surveillance
Report #5 CY08 [no link available]


There has been an interesting situation for WNV in Mid-Atlantic
States this year [2008] also.

Although nationally 2008 appears to have been one of the milder WNV
years since 2002/2003, this did not appear to be true in the
mid-Atlantic area based on mosquito surveillance results and the
number of human cases reported to date:

- CDC reports that Maryland has had 13 human cases so far this year
[2008], the most reported since 2004 [that number has increased by 1
totaling 14, as of 18 Nov 2008. - Mod.TY]
- District of Columbia (DC) has reported 7 confirmed human cases so
far, the most reported since 2002 [There are no cases in the District
of Columbia given in the 18 Nov 2008 CDC human case list. The reason
for this discrepancy is not apparent. - Mod.TY]
- CDC reports that New Jersey has 7 human cases confirmed to date,
the most reported since 2003

Mosquito surveillance conducted by the Washington DC Health
Department has recorded 25 positive mosquito pools of 706 tested.
Interestingly, mosquito surveillance conducted on military
installations in the Washington DC area by the Department of Defense
during 2008 recorded 5 times as many WNV positive mosquito pools as
were collected in 2007, and twice as many as during 2006. Only one of
the 13 sites in the DC area where mosquito surveillance was conducted
did not produce at least one positive mosquito pool.

Peaks in positive mosquito pools in the Washington DC area of similar
magnitude were recorded during August and September [2008], and the
area just had its 1st hard frost in the past 2 weeks, so the
mosquitoes are still out and about in many areas and we could see
additional human case reports coming in from this area.

[This area, and especially the Washington D.C. area does indeed seem
to be one of considerable WN virus transmission. It will be
interesting to see if there are additional human cases or
WNV-positive mosquitoes collected this late in the season.
ProMED-mail appreciates the receipt of the report above. - Mod.TY]
