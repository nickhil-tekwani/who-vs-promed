Six-year-old victim shows symptoms of rabies at PGI
---------------------------------------------------
In a shocking revelation, doctors at the PGI [Post Graduate Institute, Chandigarh] today [15 Apr 2015] diagnosed suggestive symptoms of the rabies infection in a 6-year-old girl from Mani Majra [Chandigarh], who was badly bitten on her lips by a ferocious stray dog on 25 Mar [2015].

The victim was rushed to the PGI paediatric emergency this afternoon [15 Apr 2015] after her uncle noticed froth oozing out of her mouth and her voice turning hoarse. Both these symptoms, coupled with her phobia about air (looking at the fan) and water after being taken to the emergency, are pointing towards the possibility of rabies, according to doctors. Following a late evening test, the spokesperson for the PGI, Manju Wadwalkar, said, "Preliminary investigations are suggestive of rabies."

Doctors said nothing could be said about her survival. No definite treatment for [clinical] rabies is available in India. She has been kept in isolation to prevent transmission of infection to other patients.

The family alleged that the doctors were initially reluctant to admit her, hinting that she had already developed the rabies infection. "After the intervention of Mayor Poonam Sharma, who reportedly reached the PGI after the family approached her, the doctors took her inside for an MRI," said [the patient's] uncle.

[The patient] had been given 4 of the 6 doses of the anti-rabies vaccine so far, in addition to the immunoglobulin serum. [Her] maternal uncle was forced to arrange the serum from a shop in Ambala after failing to find it in the chemist shops in the city. "We did not find time to even analyse the effectiveness of the serum (in terms of brand value) as there was no alternative injection available and it was to be given within 24 hours of the dog bite. We could arrange the injection after 18 hours of the dog bite," Ishaan said.

A day after being bitten, [the patient's] lips were sutured and she was called for a follow-up next week to assess the viability of plastic surgery for restoration of normal appearance.

On 25 Mar [2015], a stray dog had bitten 13 Mani Majra residents. All other victims are stated to be stable.

No definite treatment available in India
----------------------------------------
Doctors said nothing could be said about her survival. No definite treatment for rabies is available in India. She has been kept in isolation to prevent transmission of infection to other patients.

Only 12 cases of rabies survivors
---------------------------------
There are only 12 reported cases of rabies survivors in the world. The last such case was reported from India in April this year [2015]. Last year [2014], a 16-year-old was treated for rabies at the Command Hospital in Chandimandir [Haryana].

Mayor warns NGOs
----------------
City Mayor Poonam Sharma on Wednesday [15 Apr 2015] warned NGOs against creating hurdles in the official procedure of the dog sterilisation programme carried out by the MC in the city. She said city residents and NGOs should help the MC in conducting this programme rather than creating hurdles. She said she had come to know that some NGOs were coming in the way of the official procedure during the dog sterilisation programme.

Water, air phobia
-----------------
When [the patient] was admitted to the PGI, she was found dreading the ceiling fan air and water kept in a bottle near her bed. Experts said these were signs of the rabies infection. Sources said the virus seemed to have travelled to her brain though a nerve connecting her right cheek to the brain which was injured during the dog bite. [The latter presumably refers to damage to the girl's cheek as she was bitten on her "lips." - Mod.MHJ]

Dog sterilisation drive
-----------------------
The MC will hold a dog catching and sterilisation drive in Mani Majra on Thursday [16 Apr 2015]. MC sources said they would try to ascertain the lapses, if any, on the part of doctors during her treatment.

The description is not totally clear, but it would appear that this 6-year-old girl received both anti-serum injections as well as 4 out of 6 doses of vaccine. The incubation period was just under 20 days, presuming that symptoms had to develop to a threshold level before triggering her transfer to the hospital. As the virus travels via nerves to the brain, the incubation period is a function of how close to the brain the bite site is. In this case, very close, and therefore a short incubation period. This will impact the ability of any vaccine to prevent the onset of disease. Dog bites are more commonly to the hands, forearms, and lower legs, which gives any vaccine treatment an edge. However, subscribers are advised to read the previous posting on rabies in Punjab state and the serious concerns with the vaccine used; see 20140308.2321841. - Mod.MHJ
