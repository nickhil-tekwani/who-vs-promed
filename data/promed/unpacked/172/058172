For over 10 years now, the farmers growing oranges in Tuong Loc
Commune (Tam Binh District, Vinh Long Province) have faced the
continuous worry of the spread of citrus disease by the Asian citrus
psyllid pest, which causes severe drops in crop productivity. A woman
in the area, however, has discovered a measure to avoid such ill fortune.
After 3 years of growth, her dream orchard had not yet produced its
1st crop as the citrus disease set in. Others in Tam Binh were also
infected by the disease, and nobody knew how to cope with it, relying
on pesticides, which scarcely affected the Asian citrus psyllid pest.
In mid 2006, [the woman] learned that the orange orchard of [a man]
in Cai Be of Tien Giang province had escaped the effects of the
disease although all surrounding orchards were [infected]. She
immediately paid a visit to [the man's] orchard and found that
_Psidium guajava_ trees were growing between the orange ones. [The
woman] brought home a young _Psidium guajava_ to grow in her orange orchard.
Shortly afterwards, she witnessed the recovery of the leaves on her
orange trees growing near the _Psidium guajava_. To double-check her
results, she plucked all the leaves from the _Psidium guajava_ --
surely enough, the orange trees became re-infected. At present, many
farmers in Tam Binh grow _Psidium guajava_ between their orange trees
to protect them from the citrus disease. The orange trees have
returned to the health they had known 10 years ago.
Dr. Ngo Vinh Vien, director of the Plant Protection Institute, has
confirmed the ability of the _Psidium guajava_ to fight the
disease-spreading bug. "Japanese scientists have already known about
this unique phenomenon, and have appointed specialists to Tam Binh to
do research on it." Dr. Vien added, "To save orange growers from
going bankrupt due to the disease, this method should be recommended
to other districts and provinces. However, further studies to uncover
the interactions between the pest and the _Psidium guajava_ should be
conducted before doing so."

[2] Huanglongbing, citrus - USA (Florida): trial of guava interplanting

Citrus researchers said that they are launching a crash program to
study whether guava trees, placed in Florida orange and grapefruit
groves, can protect the state's multibillion-dollar industry from a
devastating tree disease known as greening. The technique has been
used in Viet Nam with 'dramatic' results, deterring both the insects
that spread greening and the bacterial disease itself, according to
top researchers at a federal laboratory in Fort Pierce.
The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) has within the past week
[December 2006] bought or ordered every guava plant it can find -- 15
000 to 20 000 so far -- with plans to quickly establish field tests
in South Florida, the researchers said. "We're not saying this is the
silver bullet, but this shows significant potential," said Calvin
Arnold, director of the USDA's Horticultural Research Laboratory.
Tim Gottwald, a veteran plant pathologist and leader of the new
research initiative, said he learned of the unusual effect guava
plants have in combating greening during a recent meeting in Japan
with scientists from Viet Nam and Australia. Viet Nam has little
citrus, but some small plantings there have survived at least 15
years despite the presence of greening -- and preliminary tests hint
that it is a protective effect from 'volatile compounds' given off by
guava, Gottwald said. "We're going to see if we can re-create the
effect in Florida."
Greening was 1st confirmed in Florida in 2005, but since then has
been found in 13 South Florida counties -- and the psyllid insect
that spreads it is common throughout the state, giving the research
extra urgency. The disease is difficult to detect, ruins fruit, and
eventually kills trees. Florida is the nation's leading citrus state
and 2nd only to Brazil in worldwide orange production.
One of the key USDA scientists who will work on the guava research,
insect specialist David Hall, said the preliminary evidence seems to
show that guavas suppress the levels of other insects that damage
citrus as well -- such as aphids and leaf miners, which contribute to
the spread of [citrus] canker. "There are a lot of challenges ahead,
but the data we have seen are so promising," Hall said.
Gottwald said the research by Vietnamese and Australian scientists is
only a year or 2 old, and the small, invitation-only meeting in Japan
about a week ago [December 2006] was the 1st time that the evidence
involving the guava had been publicly discussed.
Guava plants, which yield a small fruit often used for jellies and
preserves, are commonly grown in Viet Nam. Small fields that had one
guava planted for every citrus tree seemed to have nearly total
protection from greening and from the psyllid insect that spreads the
bacteria. In at least some cases, Gottwald said, citrus trees appear
to have survived unharmed for 15 years, even though greening has been
in Viet Nam since at least the 1800s and is one reason the country
has no significant commercial citrus production. In most cases,
researchers said, greening wipes out a citrus grove within 2 to 5 years.
Guavas emit numerous compounds, Gottwald said, and part of the
Florida research will be to see if researchers can isolate which ones
may be producing the deterrent effect. That might enable scientists
to synthesize the chemical and improve upon it so that citrus growers
do not have to plant huge numbers of guava trees to protect their
groves. Another part of the research --- which also will be conducted
in Brazil, where greening is a relatively newly found pest, too --
will be to determine if guava might be planted at far lower rates
than one plant per citrus tree and still achieve the same deterrent effect.
The research could take up to 3 years to produce definitive results.
But, meanwhile, growers who want to plant guava trees on their own
might have a hard time finding them because of the need to obtain
plants for basic field experiments. "We've tied up every one we can
find," Arnold said.

[Citrus greening or huanglongbing (Chinese for 'yellow dragon
disease') is one of the most damaging diseases of citrus. Symptoms
include blotchy mottling and yellowing of leaves and small,
irregularly shaped fruits with a thick, pale peel and bad taste.
Affected trees become stunted, bear multiple off-season flowers, and
may live for only a few years without ever bearing usable fruit.
Spread of citrus greening occurs primarily via citrus psyllids and
grafting. It is also transmissible through dodder (a parasitic vine),
and possibly by seed from infected plants and transovarially in the
vectors. The disease is restricted to _Citrus_ and close relatives
because of the narrow host range of the vectors. Disease management
requires an integrated approach including use of clean planting
stock, elimination of inoculum, use of pesticides for vector control
in orchards, and biological control of vectors in non-crop reservoirs.
The disease occurs throughout much of Asia, Africa south of the
Sahara, and some parts of South America. Citrus greening has not been
reported from the Mediterranean region or Australia where it is a
serious quarantine concern. The causal pathogens are highly
fastidious phloem-inhabiting bacteria, which so far cannot be
cultured; 3 different strains have been reported: _Candidatus_
Liberobacter asiaticus, _Ca._ L. africanus, and _Ca._ L. americanus
recently described from Brazil. The Asian citrus psyllid _Diaphorina
citri_ is the vector for both the Asian and the American strains. The
African citrus psyllid _Trioza erytreae_ is the vector for the
African strain. Even the psyllids on their own are a serious pest of
young citrus trees.
Citrus canker is caused by the bacterium _Xanthomonas axonopodis_
pathovar _citri_ . It can be transmitted by mechanical means, water,
insects, and infected plant material posing a serious economic threat
to citrus industries worldwide.
The tropical guava (_Psidium guajava_ L.) is a small tree thought to
originate in Central America. It is widely grown in the tropics for
food and medicinal purposes. It may also run wild forming extensive
thickets. For example, in the Pacific Islands it is classed as an
invasive species. The plant has a long history of traditional use,
much of which is being validated by scientific research. For example,
bark and leaf extracts have shown to have a toxic effect on numerous
bacteria _in vitro_. Guava extracts are used as herbal antibiotics
with significant antibacterial, antifungal, anti-yeast, anti-amoebic,
and antimalarial actions. The leaves of guava are rich in essential
oils and flavonoids, in particular, quercetin to which much of the
therapeutic activity is attributed. The plant belongs to the myrtle
family (_Myrtaceae_), which also includes other species known for
their insect-repelling essential oils and antiseptic compounds, for
example, eucalypts (_Eucalyptus_ spp.), tea trees (_Leptospermum_
spp.), and clove (_Syzygium aromaticum_).
The possible use of guava in control of citrus greening and insect
pests, including vectors of other diseases, would be very beneficial
and important for citrus growers in affected areas. If this method of
biological disease management can be shown to be practicable for
citrus, it may be possible to extend the concept to the control of
other crop diseases.
