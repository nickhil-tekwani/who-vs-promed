As a prior Leishmaniac, I also found it strange a phlebotomine-transmitted
disease would be a threat in the North East US. However, it seems from this
report the disease has been diagnosed by the CDC, and that it has a high
incidence in certain kennels, but is limited to Foxhounds. It would be
nice to hear from either the consulting veterinarian or those who made the
diagnosis at UNC.
This comes through a Foxhound and Beagling network and, although it puts
the outbreak in perspective, does not give some of the details (dates,
times, of deaths, post mortem findings, titre levels, species of
Leishmania, etc.). There are some therapies used in human visceral
Leishmaniasis that might work in dogs.

MFHA CANCELS ALL SPRING FOXHOUND SHOWS
On April 14, the leaders of the Masters of Foxhounds Association (MFHA) of
America, in conjunction with the Foxhound Club of North America, decided to
cancel all foxhound shows this spring. The reason is concern about canine
leishmaniasis, a protozoan disease infecting at least 3 foxhound packs in
the last 10 years.
Officials at the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta
suggested they impose a moratorium on all foxhound travel until all hounds
can be tested.
For about a year, Millbrook Hunt, New York has been fighting a mysterious
disease veterinarians thought might be a tick-borne disease. But after
Huntsman Betsy Park sent them blood samples, scientists from the CDC and
North Carolina State University (NCSU) determined it was canine
leishmaniasis, which rarely occurs in this country. Since last fall, 20
Millbrook foxhounds have died, and 45 of 90 foxhounds have tested positive.
Also residing at Millbrook are the Basset and Beagle packs of Sandanona
Hare Hounds. But all Bassets and Beagles have tested negative. All
personnel, horses, and house dogs walking out with the hounds have tested
negative. Wildlife (including mice, squirrels, fox and opossum) surrounding
the kennel were trapped by scientists and tested negative.
Dennis Foster, the MFHA executive director, commended Millbrook's
initiative to investigate the cause and possible treatment of their hounds'
mysterious illness. "I think we have it well in hand. Millbrook has it well
in hand," Foster said during a meeting at the National Beagle Club's Spring
Basset Trials. Millbrook is the only North American pack currently
confirmed to have the disease.
CDC scientists report the vector for leishmaniasis is a sand fly. The
disease occurs in humans and is common in domestic and wild dogs in the
Middle East, Italy and Spain. Some speculate U.S. servicemen may have
brought the disease home in their pets.
Cases have occurred sporadically in the United States for 20 years. In
1989, Metamora Hunt, Michigan, foxhounds began to have cases of the disease
with fatalities. But a sled-dog team kenneled next to the foxhounds tested
negative and never contracted it.
No one knows how Millbrook's foxhounds contracted the disease. The range of
sand flies do not extend as far north as New York. Millbrook staff,
veterinarians and scientists have reviewed the hounds' travel records and
have concluded all the infected hounds have traveled to joint meets. Hounds
that have not traveled have tested negative.
In a statement issued to its masters, the MFHA stated, "Health officials
have recommended hunt clubs not travel or interact with hounds outside
their individual kennels until more reliable information is available as to
transmission, prevalence and incubation period. Therefore the MFHA/FCNA
have canceled all hound shows this year.
"Dog-to-human infection risk is minimal, if possible at all," the statement
continues. "Humans can be treated and completely cured. At this time there
is no known cure for this disease in canines, and it is normally fatal. The
canine symptoms include wasting, lack of endurance, bleeding, seizures,
photophobia, hair loss, skin lesions, renal failure and swollen limbs and
joints." The MFHA recommends all hunts use 1 of the 2 reliable blood tests
to test all their hounds.
"Because of this potentially serious situation, it is important you test
all hounds in your kennels," adds the MFHA statement. "Any untested hound
will be prohibited from participating in any future MFHA/FCNA -sanctioned
foxhound show, puppy shows with other than their own hounds, or performance
trials.
"Until further notice no member hunt will be allowed to draft hounds to
another hunt, send hounds to be bred at other kennels, or use artificial
insemination outside their own kennel. It is imperative there be no joint
meets with hounds in attendance from more than one pack. This moratorium
will continue until we determine the extent of the problem and receive
medical advice from the experts."

Just a brief correction - there are sand flies in the United States and
some of them are capable of transmitting _Leishmania_ species (and other
diseases including vesicular stomatitis). See references below:

I think I'll stick my neck out on this one. Whereas sand flies are the only
known natural vectors of leishmaniasis, congenital and venereal
transmission have been reported in humans. In a dog kennel where dogs are
in close contact, it does not seem inconceivable that dog to dog
transmission could occur if an infected dog (perhaps imported from Brazil
or southern Europe; or even southwestern US) were introduced.
Humans infected with visceral leishmaniasis (_Leishmania donovani_ or
_Leishmania infantum_) shed parasites in nasal secretions, urine and other
body fluids. A dog infected with _Leishmania infantum_ becomes a sack of
parasites and may also shed parasites in body secretions/excretions. Who
knows what dogs do in kennels?
By the way, there are sand flies in the U.S.; _Lutzomyia shanonni_, a
competent vector, has been reported as far north as New Jersey and Maryland
(Young, D.G. and Perkins, P.V.,1984. Phlebotomine sand flies of North
America. J. Am. Mosq. Contr. Assoc. 44:263-304) . However, most vector
species in the U.S. are limited to the southern tier of states.

Sand flies in the USA: Phlebotomine sand flies do occur in the USA. A
paper was published in the Journal of the American Mosquito Control
Association a few years ago (mid 1980s). See also:

I am disappointed to see the misconception that there are no sand flies
(_Diptera: Psychodidae_) in North America north of Mexico go unchallenged.
Although they are not as well studied as elsewhere, I can assure you they
are present. Below is a selective listing of publications which may be of
interest.
