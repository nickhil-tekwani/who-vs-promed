A health crisis is looming over the island as the Ministry of Health
and Environment has confirmed 100 cases of leptospirosis.

Hurricane Dean [occurred] in August [2007], and the heavy rains
currently [are] lashing the island.

Rudyard Spencer, the Minister of Health and Environment, urged
persons to use rat [baits] to prevent any further spread of the
disease. "In order to contain it (leptospirosis) we have launched a
very serious attack on rats because we can (not) afford for our
children especially to be exposed to the kinds of rats," he said.

[The disease (leptospirosis) is spread by eating foods or handling
water contaminated by urine of infected animal; tending infected
animals (dogs, cows, goats, pigs); bathing or wading in stagnant
water frequented by animals, especially after flood rains.]

[Leptospirosis is a zoonosis caused by the spirochete _Leptospira_.
It is usually transmitted to humans from asymptomatic carrier animals
(for example rodents and domesticated animals, such as dogs, pigs,
and cattle) that intermittently or continuously excrete the organisms
in their urine. Exposure occurs usually by contact of broken skin or
mucous membranes with water or muddy soil contaminated by urine from
these chronically infected animals. Person-to-person spread is not
known to occur.

Leptospirosis is endemic in Jamaica, and outbreaks follow flooding
after heavy rains in autumn

In fact, leptospirosis has been documented serologically in domestic
animals (pigs, cows and goats) and _Leptospira_ have been isolated
from soil and water samples in Jamaica
(<http://bases.bireme.br/cgi-bin/wxislind.exe/iah/online/?IsisScript=iah/iah.xis&src=google&base=MedCarib&lang=p&nextAction=lnk&exprSearch=13799&indexSearch=ID>).


Because the clinical manifestations of leptospirosis are
non-specific, the definitive diagnosis requires confirmation by
serology or culture. Indeed, a previous news release from Jamaica
emphasized that "many persons were showing up with symptoms that
mimicked leptospirosis but were not necessarily afflicted with the
disease." Other diseases that can mimic leptospirosis include dengue
and hepatitis A, which are also endemic in Jamaica
