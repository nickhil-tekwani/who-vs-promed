Epidemic in Basilicata
----------------------
Three days ago we had the latest outbreak in Basilicata and it involved a
pig. _Bacillus anthracis_ was isolated.
The sanitary authority suspended the prohibition to collect mushrooms and
other natural products. But there is [now] the prohibition to hunt wild boar.

[Pigs, though moderately resistant to anthrax, do get infected either
through contaminated pig feed or by feeding on the carcasses or organs of
dead animals. I suspect the latter. As the outbreaks are still occurring
though now outside the usual "Anthrax season" it is very wise of the local
authorities to forbid boar hunting. - Mod.MHJ]
