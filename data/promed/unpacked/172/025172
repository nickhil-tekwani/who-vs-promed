The North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services (NCDHHS) has confirmed the 1st death related to an ongoing outbreak of hepatitis A affecting parts of North Carolina. The death occurred in October 2018. To protect the privacy of the family, additional details about the case are not being released.

Hepatitis A is a contagious and vaccine-preventable liver infection that can range from a mild illness lasting a few weeks to a severe illness lasting several months. It is usually transmitted through food or water that has been contaminated with small, undetectable amounts of feces from a contagious person. "The best way to protect yourself against hepatitis A is through vaccination," said Dr Heidi Swygard, viral hepatitis medical director in DHHS' Division of Public Health. "Good handwashing is also important, especially after using the bathroom, changing diapers, and before preparing or eating food. Anyone who thinks they may have been infected or exposed should seek medical attention."

An average of 41 cases of hepatitis A were reported each year in North Carolina from 2013-2017, and a total of 64 cases have already been reported this year as of the end of October 2018. Of those 64 cases, 37 have been connected to the ongoing outbreak. More than 70 percent of cases reported in 2018 have resulted in hospitalization.

Since 2017, the CDC has received more than 7000 reports of hepatitis A linked to a multi-state outbreak with higher than expected hospitalization and death rates. Because hepatitis A causes inflammation of the liver, anyone with underlying liver disease is at risk of more serious illness if infected.

[Of the 37 cases associated with the outbreak (https://www.newsobserver.com/news/local/article221198095.html), 20 have been reported in Mecklenburg county where the city of Charlotte is located. 6 have been reported in the Triangle: 3 in Wake county, 2 in Johnston, and 1 in Durham.

It is unclear what the epidemiology of the cases in NC is but likely, as in a number of other states lead currently by Kentucky and West Virginia, that marginalized individuals such as the homeless and substance abuser cohorts represent the core of the cases. The mode of transmission in these outbreaks (Kentucky is reporting more than 100 new cases per week) parallels that of a 3rd world country related to poor sanitation rather than a particular contaminated food vehicle. - Mod.LL
