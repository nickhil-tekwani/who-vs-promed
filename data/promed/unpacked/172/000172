An Oregon State University [OSU] student has been diagnosed with meningococcal disease, raising the possibility of a fresh outbreak on the Corvallis campus.

Benton County health officials announced on [Fri 27 Oct 2017] that an OSU undergrad is being treated for the potentially deadly illness, which can be spread through close contact with an infected person. Test results showing which strain of the disease is involved are expected to be available next week.

Bill Emminger, director of the county's Environmental Health Division, said in a news release that it seems likely that all close contacts of the unidentified student have been identified and given preventive antibiotics, but anyone experiencing high fever, headache, stiff neck, or other symptoms of meningitis should seek medical attention.

3 OSU students were infected with strain [serogroup] B of the meningococcal virus last winter [2016-17], prompting health officials to declare an outbreak. All of the infected students were hospitalized for treatment and recovered from the disease, and dozens of people who were in close contact with them received antibiotics.

The university also scheduled large-scale vaccination clinics in an effort to ensure that potentially susceptible populations were immunized against strain B.

A 2015 outbreak at the University of Oregon sickened 7 people and left 1 student dead.

[Between 13 Jan 2015 and 19 Mar 2015, the University of Oregon campus in Eugene, Oregon had 6 cases of serogroup B invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) in students; a 7th case occurred in a student's father who visited the campus between 2 and 3 May 2015 (see ProMED-mail post Meningitis, meningococcal - USA: (OR) fatal, college, sg. B, sg. B vaccine 20150531.3398946).

In November 2016, ProMED-mail posted a report that 2 Oregon State University [OSU] students in Corvallis, Oregon were diagnosed with IMD due to _Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroup B (see ProMED-mail post Meningitis, meningococcal - USA (02): (OR) college, sg B, sg B vaccine 20161123.4649319) and in Mar 2017, meningococcal serogroup B meningitis was reported in a 3rd student on the Corvallis campus (see ProMED-mail post Meningitis, meningococcal - USA: (OR) college, sg B, sg B vaccine, RFI 20170305.4881298).

The news report above tells of another OSU student on the Corvallis campus with IMD; we are not told in the report if the IMD is meningococcal meningitis or meningococcemia, or what the serogroup of the pathogen is. This case has occurred despite a campus-wide vaccination program with a meningococcal serogroup B vaccine started in November 2016 and the requirement that incoming students at OSU be vaccinated against meningococcal serogroups A,C,W and Y. The news report above does not give the vaccination status of the latest OSU student with IMD.

OSU is a coeducational, public university; the main campus is located in the city of Corvallis in the Willamette Valley of the US of Oregon (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon_State_University#Main_campus_.28Corvallis.29). OSU has a total student enrollment of 30 354, the largest among all Oregon universities. The University of Oregon campus in Eugene, Oregon is 47 miles (75.6 km) south of Corvallis. - Mod.ML
