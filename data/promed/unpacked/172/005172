Re the article (02) posted 5 Oct 2005, I would recommend checking the water in
the reflecting pool at the mall. Basically if you want a new strain of _F.
tularensis_, go to your nearest stream or other body of water! Some time ago --
and way before 9/11 -- I sampled the water (a tiny stream) behind my
residence in the Seattle area and scored a nice strain of tularemia with no
problem.

The editorial comment on Kate Torres' query perpetuates a poorly documented
assertion about the agent of tularemia, viz., that it may stably persist in
soil. I am unaware of any primary literature that documents this for Type A
(_Francisella tularensis tularensis_).
Indeed, the North American reports of persistence of _F. tularensis_ in water
and mud (classic studies by Jellison and others) need to be reexamined,
because it is unclear which subspecies was present. I would bet that it was
all Type B. There is no question that Type B (_F. tularensis palaearctica_)
persists in water and mud, and large outbreaks have been recorded in Eurasia
associated with arvicoline [living in the fields or countryside - Mod.LL]
rodent excreta contaminating hay or other environmental materials.�
Type B is a very different bug from Type A. Type A depends on ticks for its
enzootic cycle. Type B may have multiple modes of perpetuation, including
emerging evidence for an association with free-living amebae, which might
explain prolonged persistence in wet environments. Naked bacteria of either
type seem extremely fastidious and labile in vitro, a fact that stands in
contrast to a perception that the agent of tularemia is environmentally
persistent.
Environmental material may certainly be contaminated by excreta or animal
carcasses and serve as fomites, but the duration of infectivity of such
materials is extremely poorly defined except for Type B. The suggestion that
Type A (which is most likely the one detected around DC) is stable in soil (by
soil I mean dry earth, as opposed to mud, which has a large aqueous fraction)
for any length of time needs to be backed up by finding primary peer-reviewed
publications, and not by referring to discussion within reviews or reports of
outbreaks wherein arguments are being made about the most likely mode of
transmission. Facts get altered when they are passed from review to review,
and from recent discussions referencing such reviews. In addition, it is not
correct to equate the physiologic attributes of one _F. tularensis_ subspecies
with another.
As for urban tularemia, dog ticks (_Dermacentor variabilis_) are important
vectors of Type A. Dog ticks certainly occur in urban areas, as do their main
reproductive hosts, raccoons and skunks. The potential for zoonoses
transmitted by urban dog ticks was underscored by the cluster of Rocky
Mountain spotted fever cases in a Manhattan park (Salgo et al. 1988 NEJM
318:1345). Cottontail rabbits and their ticks (_Ixodes dentatus_,
_Haemaphysalis leporispalustris_) are also fairly common in urban peridomestic
settings.
