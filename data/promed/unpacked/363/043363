Avian Influenza - Viet Nam and Cambodia - WHO Update 12
-----------------------------------------------
Viet Nam
---------
The Ministry of Health in Viet Nam has confirmed 3 additional cases of
human infection with avian influenza A (H5N1) virus. The cases concern a
5-year-old boy from the central province of Quang Binh, a 17-year-old girl
from the northern province of Nam Dinh, and a 40-year-old woman from the
northern province of Quang Ninh. The 17-year-old girl has died. An earlier
case has also been confirmed. These recently confirmed cases bring the
total in Viet Nam since mid-December 2004 to 28.
WHO is aware of reports of suspected avian influenza A (H5N1) virus
infection in 5 members of a family who are presently hospitalized in the
northern port city of Haiphong. These cases, which include the parents and
their 3 young daughters, are undergoing further investigation following
initial tests indicating infection with the H5 subtype of avian influenza.
Reports indicate outbreaks of avian influenza in poultry in the vicinity.
Field investigation of this family cluster is under way.
The current outbreak of human cases in Viet Nam has included several
clusters, mostly in family members, of cases closely related in time and
place. Thorough investigation of all such clusters is essential to
determine possible changes in the behavior of the virus and thus support
assessment of the risk of an influenza pandemic. There is currently no
evidence that the H5N1 virus is spreading easily from person to person.
Rapid sharing with WHO of viruses from recent clusters of cases has become
increasingly important. Analysis can determine whether any significant
changes in the virus have taken place and provide further support for risk
assessment.
Several media reports have recently covered rumors of a large outbreak of
influenza-like illness in Quang Binh Province. The outbreak is presently
under investigation by provincial and central health authorities. Samples
have been taken for testing, and WHO is awaiting the results. The number of
cases with influenza-like illness appears much smaller than initially
reported by the media.
Cambodia
--------
The Ministry of Health in Cambodia has today [Tue 29 Mar 2005] confirmed
the country's 2nd human case of avian influenza. The 28-year-old man, from
Kampot Province, developed symptoms on 17 Mar 2005 and was hospitalized in
Phnom Penh on 21 Mar 2005. He died on 22 Mar 2005. The same day, laboratory
tests by the Pasteur Institute in Phnom Penh confirmed that the man was
infected with avian influenza A (H5N1) virus. The Cambodian government
immediately launched an investigation to search for possible additional
cases and identify possible sources of exposure to the virus. The
investigation team, which is continuing its work in Kampot Province,
includes Cambodian Ministry of Health and Ministry of Agricultural
officials joined by staff from the WHO country office and the Pasteur
Institute in Phnom Penh.
FAO is assisting the investigation of animal disease. Numerous deaths among
chickens in the area have been reported, and samples taken from sick
chickens have tested positive for avian influenza. The results from the
investigation indicate the deceased man had contact with sick poultry.
An 18-year-old boy initially identified as an additional suspected case has
tested negative for avian influenza virus. Samples taken from 27 other
people, including family contacts of the confirmed case and Phnom Penh
medical staff involved in his care, have all tested negative for H5 avian
influenza virus infection. Results from a further 6 people from Kampot
Province have also tested negative for H5 influenza virus. Cambodia's
previous case, a 25-year-old woman who died in late January 2005, was also
from Kampot Province but lived in another district.
The majority of poultry in Cambodia are raised in small backyard flocks in
rural areas, making surveillance for outbreaks especially challenging. A
campaign to educate rural populations about the dangers of contact with
dead or diseased poultry is being undertaken by the government, with
support from WHO.

Viet Nam: 4 more suspected human cases of avian influenza
-----------------------------------------------
Tests for the H5N1 avian influenza virus were under way on a 25-year-old
woman who was taken to Ho Chi Minh City's Hospital for Tropical Diseases on
Tuesday [29 Mar 2005] with coughing and fever after returning from
Cambodia, a hospital official told Reuters. He gave no further details of
her trip to Cambodia, where officials said last week that bird flu killed a
28-year-old man, the country's 2nd victim of the poultry virus.
2 other Vietnamese suspects, a 41-year-old woman and a child, had fallen
sick in the same district near the northern port city of Haiphong, where 5
members of one family have been confirmed as suffering from bird flu.
"Their conditions are stabilizing," a doctor in Haiphong's Viet Tiep
hospital said of the couple and their 3 daughters. The 41-year-old woman
was a neighbor of the family, and tests on her were under way, he said.
Doctors said the 5 patients ate sick chicken, when half of their 400 birds
died earlier this month [March 2005]. "A field investigation of this family
cluster is under way," said a World Health Organization statement seen on
Wed 29 2005 on its website: <http://www.who.int.>. [See the above WHO
Update 12. - Mod.CP]. The WHO noted that recent outbreaks of human cases in
Viet Nam included several clusters, mostly family members. "There is
currently no evidence that the H5N1 virus is spreading easily from person
to person," it said, referring to fears the H5N1 virus could mutate into a
form which could pass between humans easily and cause a global pandemic.
The 4th avian influenza suspect, a 30-year-old man from the central
province of Quang Tri, was at the Hue Central Hospital, deputy director Bui
Duc Phu said. Doctors were awaiting the results of tests on him and a
16-month-old boy from Quang Binh province, where a 5-year-old boy was
confirmed to have had avian influenza, and 37 other people had fevers, Phu
said.
Avian influenza swept across much of Asia early last year [2004] and has
killed 35 people in Viet Nam, 14 of them since the disease broke out anew
in the southern Mekong Delta in December 2004. The virus, which has also
killed 12 Thais and 2 Cambodians, has been fatal in about 70 percent of the
known human cases, but it does not pass easily from bird to humans, and
eating infected fowl cooked properly is not dangerous.
