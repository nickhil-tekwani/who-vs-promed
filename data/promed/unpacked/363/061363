Anthrax is not cause of cattle deaths in Suva Planina
-----------------------------------------------------
Analyses of dead calves from Suva Planina [a mountain in south eastern Serbia], which were made at the Institute of Veterinary Medicine in Nis [Nisava District], showed that anthrax is not the cause of death of 3 calves. Anthrax is not present among cattle in Suva Planina, veterinary doctor Mladen Popovic, from veterinary station in Bela Palanka, told Tanjug.

"Analyses were negative, we ordered employees of 'Komnis' to dispose of 3 calves in accordance with regulations, and our workers will do disinfection of the field in which were located the remains of the dead cattle," said Popovic. "We found that there [are] no more deaths among the cattle, and we urged cattle owners to contact us whenever they notice something suspicious and trained them how to behave," added Popovic.
