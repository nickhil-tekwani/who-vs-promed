Health ministry registers 142 cases of bird flu
-----------------------------------------------
An official in the Iraqi ministry of Health's Epidemic Disease
Commission announced yesterday [Fri 25 Feb 2011] that 142 cases of
avian flu (H5N1) have been recorded in the country so far this
winter.

Ihsan Jaafar told AKnews that the ministry is concerned about the
spread of the disease in remote areas of the country, far from medical
facilities. "Mountain areas and areas close to water are the most in
danger of suffering a flu pandemic," he said.

Jaafar assured that the Ministry is taking proactive measures to
control the spread of the disease.

Iraq registered the 1st fatality from avian flu in 2006.

[The above information, allegedly derived from official public health
sources and supposedly informing about human H5N1 cases, is in need of
confirmation [and almost certainly relates to animal health - Mod.DK].
According to the WHO, as of 9 Feb 2011 there have only been 3 human
cases and 2 fatalities in Iraq, all in 2006
(<http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/country/cases_table_2011_02_09/en/index.html>).
On the other hand, very little is known about the current animal
health situation in Iraq.

Iraq, a member of the OIE, had submitted its last official
animal-health report to the organisation on 21 Apr 2009; this was an
annual report, covering the period Jan - Dec 2008. No later reports --
either immediate notifications nor periodic (semi-annual or annual)
reports -- from Iraq are available on OIE's interface. Iraq's delegate
to the OIE is Dr Salah Fadhil Abbas, Director General, Animal Health,
Ministry of Agriculture, Wazeriha, Wazeryia, Baghdad.

An official report on the current HPAI situation is anticipated.
Previous requests for information on the epizootiological situation in
Iraq have remained unattended to (see 20101229.4585, 20110123.0282).

Initiative from the side of international agencies, such as the FAO
and/or OIE, to enhance Iraq's submission of its due animal disease
reports will be commendable. FAO's Field Programme Activities include
the project OSRO/IRQ/707/UDG, "Strengthening the capacity of the Iraqi
Veterinary Services for control of Zoonotic and Transboundary Animal
Diseases" (funded, for the period 2009-2011, at USD 3 001 714). -
