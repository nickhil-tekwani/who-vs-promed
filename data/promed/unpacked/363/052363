Americans and Canadians who traveled frequently to Britain during that
country's mad-cow disease crisis are banned from donating blood, government
agencies in both North American countries announced Tuesday.
The ban on blood donations applies to anyone who has traveled or lived in
Britain for a total of six months since 1980. The restriction that could cut
the blood supply during a critical time of shortage.
Tourists who spent just a few weeks in Britain can still donate blood, but
people who went to Britain repeatedly between 1980 and 1997, the crisis
years, will have to add up the length of their trips to see if the six-month
limit applies.
The mad-cow disease that swept through Britain's cattle during the last two
decades has been linked to a human brain-destroying illness. Although the
donor ban is only a precaution -- there is no evidence that any mad cow-type
illness has been spread through human blood transfusions -- both illnesses
are so mysterious that scientists can't rule out the possibility of harm
from infected blood.
Still, the FDA's donor ban is controversial. It is sure to frighten
Americans whose blood is refused.
Worse, the American Red Cross estimates the ban will cut U.S. blood
donations by 2.2 percent at a critical time. Even before Tuesday's action,
experts were predicting severe, nationwide blood shortages to hit as early
as next year because blood donations already were falling.
As many as 200 000 to 250 000 blood donors could be turned away by the new
ban, said James MacPherson of America's Blood Centers, which represents
blood banks that provide half the nation's supply. Because people in the
Northeast and large cities travel more than people from other parts of the
country, areas such as New York could be hard hit.
"We certainly do not intend by this to scare people," said Mary Elizabeth
Jacobs, the FDA scientist who coordinated the policy's development.
The FDA plans to work with blood banks to find ways to ease the donor loss,
but MacPherson said the government also needs to help blood banks explain
the issue to the confused or frightened donors they turn away.
"It's going to be an extremely difficult issue for people to understand," he
said.
The Canadian blood-donor base could fall by 3 percent because of the ban,
officials of the Health Canada agency forecast.
Lynda Cranston, chief executive officer of Canadian Blood Services, said the
ban would likely cause some problems for Canadian blood supplies which
recently suffered a sharp drop in blood donations because of a scandal over
AIDS and Hepatitis-tainted blood.
"We recognize that we are losing ... donors, many of them being our most
frequent donors," Cranston said of the new ban.
But she said the move is necessary to restore confidence in the blood supply
system.
About one in 1 million people around the world gets a similar brain disease
called Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, or CJD. Although CJD sometimes is
hereditary, its cause is generally unknown.
The worry about blood stems from Britain's discovery in the mid-1990s that
some people apparently caught a new strain of CJD by eating beef infected
with mad cow disease. Named "new variant CJD," it has killed 41 Britons.
There is no known mad-cow disease in U.S. cattle. The United States has not
allowed importation of British beef for over a decade, and no American is
known to have caught new variant CJD.
But because these brain diseases can incubate for years without causing
symptoms, some scientists say the possibility exists that they'll one day
discover a link between blood transfusions and infection.
Much is not known about the new human disease, including exactly how Britons
were sickened. Theoretically, even a brief visit to Britain could have
exposed someone to new variant CJD. But the FDA settled on the 6-month
limit to reduce the possible risk without slashing the U.S. blood supply;
banning donors who spent less time in Britain would have had a far greater
impact.
The ban covers travel to or residence in England, Scotland, Wales, Northern
Ireland, the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands.
