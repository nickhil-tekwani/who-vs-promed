Encephalitis strikes 3 animals in north west Wisconsin
------------------------------------------------------
Two alpacas have died in Dunn County and a horse has been sickened by
eastern equine encephalitis, or EEE, a mosquitoborne illness caused by
a virus that attacks the central nervous system.

Although humans may also contract EEE, no human cases have appeared in
Wisconsin.

"Horse owners who have not already had their animals vaccinated this
year [2011] for EEE and other mosquitoborne diseases should take this
as a warning, and those who have vaccinated should check with their
veterinarians to see whether a booster is indicated," said state
veterinarian Dr Robert Ehlenfeldt. There is no approved vaccine for
alpacas. Alpaca owners should consult their veterinarians about
preventive measures, he said.

Blood samples were sent to the University of Minnesota Veterinary
Diagnostic Laboratory 9 Jul 2011. Initial positive results there were
confirmed by the Pennsylvania Animal Diagnostic Laboratory System,
which reported final positive results today [9 Aug 2011].

EEE may be transmitted by mosquito bite to horses, birds, and humans.
It is unusual, but not unheard of, for alpacas and other mammals to be
infected. The virus is not transmitted between animals or between
animals and humans. Clinical signs in horses include depression, loss
of appetite, drooping eyelids and lower lip, aimless wandering and
circling, blindness, and sometimes paralysis. There is no cure; the
disease must run its course and has a mortality rate of 90 per cent or
higher.

Wisconsin experienced a major outbreak of EEE in 2001, with 69
confirmed or presumptive positive cases, mostly in north western
Wisconsin. Since then, sporadic cases have occurred. Because EEE
follows mosquito populations, it normally occurs beginning in mid to
late summer and remains a threat until the 1st killing frost.

Horses that have never been vaccinated will need 2 doses 2 to 4 weeks
apart, and the vaccine will take at least 2 weeks to build up enough
antibodies to protect them. A booster would normally be only 1 dose
and would take about 4 days to be effective. Vaccines will not protect
horses that have already been infected when they receive the
injections. Vaccines are available that protect against other strains
of equine encephalitis along with EEE, and a separate West Nile virus
vaccine is also available. [There is also a combination vaccine
available, which includes West Nile virus. - Mod.TG]

"Northern Wisconsin has good mosquito habitat, and that has been where
we've seen most cases of EEE over the years," Ehlenfeldt said. "It's
been a wet summer up north, and mosquito populations are really high.
If we get a good long fall, we could see a lot more cases."

In addition to vaccination, owners can take steps to reduce their
animals' exposure to mosquitoes. They should eliminate standing water
by removing objects like old tires or even the folds in tarps where
water collects, and frequently changing water in water troughs, bird
baths, and similar containers. Owners should also keep their animals
insides barns if possible from dusk through dawn, when mosquitoes are
most active.

[Reported clinical signs of EEE infection in llamas and alpacas are
consistent with brain (CNS) disease and may include dullness, fever,
incoordination, mentally inappropriate behavior, seizures, inability
to rise, persistent tilting of the head, rapid eye movement, and a
swan-like backward flexion (opisthotonus) of the head and neck.
Unfortunately, there are no disease specific findings for EEE
infection, as these signs may mimic other CNS and spinal problems such
as West Nile virus infection, equine herpesvirus-1, rabies, trauma,
bacterial meningitis, thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency, tick
paralysis, and meningeal worm infection. Therefore, additional
diagnostics such as a spinal tap and blood analysis are commonly
required to make a diagnosis. To date, most reported cases have
involved young camelids.

Prior to September 2004, it was felt that camelids were not infected
by the EEE virus, but necropsy of an alpaca at the Cummings School of
Veterinary Medicine at Tufts University at that time confirmed EEE as
the cause of death. In the course of preparing a publication on this
case, researchers at Tufts discovered several other cases where EEE
had been confirmed as the cause of death in camelids. The fact that
alpacas were (and are) at risk from EEE was not widely disseminated.

There are currently some experimental trials in various locations to
ascertain if camelids will develop a virus neutralizing response to
equine vaccines. It appears this may be the case, but trials are
ongoing.
