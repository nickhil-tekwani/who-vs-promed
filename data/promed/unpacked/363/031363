Japan: More than 41 000 Cases of Pharyngoconjunctival Fever Nationwide
-----------------------------------------------
"Swimming pool fever," a fever that primarily hits toddlers sharing
swimming pools, is sweeping across Japan, according to the National
Institute of Infectious Diseases. The institute said it has received
reports of around 41 500 patients between January and late June [2006] from
around 3000 designated pediatric clinics. Patients have been reported in
all 47 prefectures, it said.
The institute warned in May 2006 that this summer could see the biggest
outbreak of the fever in a decade. The latest figures represent a rise of
more than 1.7 times the level in 2004, when a 10-year high was marked.
Based on estimates, the actual number of patients, including those not
covered by the designated clinics, could be around 10 times greater, the
institute said.
Since the start of the year [2006], the average number of patients with
pharyngoconjunctival fever, commonly called "pool fever" in Japan, per
clinic has exceeded the corresponding number in 2004 in almost every week,
the Institute said. In the latest reporting week of 26 Jun to 2 Jul 2006,
an average of 1.28 persons were reported with the fever per clinic,
outpacing the 0.87 in the corresponding period of 2004. More than 70
percent of the patients were 5 years old or under, and 90 percent were age
9 or under.
An Institute official advised people to take such precautions as washing
hands, gargling and not sharing towels. Major symptoms of the fever include
temperatures of around 39 C, headaches, fatigue and sore eyes and throat.
It typically clears up in 3-5 days, but in some cases may cause severe
complications such as respiratory problems.

["Swimming pool fever" is commonly, but not exclusively, associated with
adenovirus infection. Two types of ocular disease commonly caused by
adenoviruses are pharyngoconjunctival fever and epidemic
keratoconjunctivitis. Pharyngoconjunctival fever is usually caused by human
adenovirus types 3, 4 or 7, and the ocular symptoms are relatively mild,
consisting of conjunctivitis mainly. (Epidemic keratoconjunctivitison, on
the other hand, is usually caused by adenovirus types 8, 19, and 37, and
the ocular symptoms are more severe, including keratitis and
conjunctivitis.) Pharyngoconjunctival fever is characterized by
conjunctivitis, fever, pharyngitis, and enlargement of the adenoids.
Infection is often disseminated by inadequately chlorinated swimming pools,
hence the name "swimming pool fever." The nationwide prevalence of
pharyngoconjunctival fever in Japan (present currently in all 47
prefectures) suggests that the level of chlorination employed is not
sufficient to inactivate adenoviruses. - Mod.CP]
