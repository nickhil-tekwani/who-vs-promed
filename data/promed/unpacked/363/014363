6 fresh cases of dengue were reported in the national capital
yesterday, [Wed 03 Sep 2008] taking number of those affected by the
mosquito-related illness to whopping 92. The total number of people
infected with the deadly dengue disease in Delhi has gone up as
compared to past year [2007] and the large numbers of cases are being
reported from the good localities in Gurgaon which shows that people
are not paying any heed to health authorities in terms of helping
them in eliminating _Aedes aegypti_ breeding.

Dr. N K Yadav, Municipal Health Officer, MCD, said, "Delhi has
reported 92 cases of dengue this year. No dengue death has been
confirmed."

On Wednesday [03 Sep 2008], a suspected death from mosquito borne
disease was reported from the Delhi Cantonment area but still tests
are needed to be done to reach at any conclusion. The Municipal
Health Officer said that the civic bodies are taking all necessary
preventive measures including checking of premises for mosquito
breeding, to prevent the spread of the disease.

West Delhi remained the hard hit with Najafgarh municipal zone and
West zone reporting 15 cases each, 2nd number was Karol Bagh and city
zones which reported 7 cases each and Shahdara North and South zones
reported 6 cases each.

Vijender Gupta, MCD Standing Committee Chairman has asked the
officials to get daily reports from the domestic breeding checkers.
He said, "They should take signatures of house owners to prove that
they have actually carried out the checking." Adding further he said,
"There is a need to fix accountability."

Normally the cases of dengue starts appearing in August end and reach
their peak in October before coming down, the Municipal officials
said. At this time of year when there is enough moisture in the air
which helps in breeding of mosquitoes and the city reporting much
higher number of dengue cases as compared to past year, the civic
authorities are taking all necessary preventive measure to prevent
the spread of the disease.

Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) and the New Delhi Municipal
Council (NDMC) issued notices to several offices and premises which
were found to be acting as breeding grounds for mosquitoes.
Ironically, many government buildings have their names included in
the list, such as Nirman Bhawan, Shastri Bhawan, Krishi Bhawan
housing key ministries as also many prominent city hospitals.

On Tuesday [02 Sep 2008], the health officials told that this year
nearly 299 people have died due to malaria and 19 others due to
dengue throughout the nation. In year 2006, in Delhi only 3366 cases
were reported of dengue fever and 25 people died due to the illness.

Till now there is no vaccine for preventing dengue. So the best
preventive measure for people living in areas infested with _Aedes
aegypti_ is to eliminate the places where the mosquito lays her eggs,
primarily artificial containers that hold water.

Make sure you cover properly or discard all the items which can hold
water and provide breeding ground for mosquito such as plastic
containers, big drums, buckets, or used automobile tires. Use
insecticide treated mosquito nets and curtains at night, use
repellents, wear protective clothes preferably sprayed with a
repellent.

[Successful public compliance with measures to eliminate water
catchments where _Aedes aegypti_, the dengue virus vector mosquito,
breeds requires effective public education. ProMED would be
interested in receiving details about public education efforts that
are being carried out in Delhi.

The Mathaba.net News of 04 Sep 2008
<http://mathaba.net/news/?x=605012> reported that the total figure of
93 dengue cases in Delhi is incorrect. Several cases go unreported,
as there is no system in place to maintain a database of dengue cases
coming to private hospitals or clinics. The article continued,
stating that the dengue situation in the neighboring state, Haryana
is also fast getting out of hand with as many as 320 cases reported
so far.

A total of 195 deaths have been recorded caused by dengue in the
Philippines from January up to 02 Aug [2008], the country's health
agency said on Monday [01 Sep 2008]. Over the past months, around 19
658 dengue cases were recorded, compared to 22 028 in the same period
of last year, said Eric Tayag, chief of the Philippine National
Epidemiology Center. Among the 195 fatalities, 37 died in the
country's capital of Metro Manila.

Tayag said that in Metro Manila, there was a 3346 increase of dengue
cases, from last year's 2432 in the period. Tayag added that his
agency is now readying for a possible surge of dengue incidents with
the rainy season expected to peak in September and October [2008].

The health agency will closely monitor those flood-prone areas that
are vulnerable to the water-borne disease, he added.

[3] Viet Nam (Ca Mau)

With the number of new patients of dengue fever 70 [to] 80 percent
lower than the number in July [2008] when the disease spread fastest,
the disease now is under control in the southern province of Ca Mau,
according to the province's Centre for Preventive Medicine.

Up to now [6 Sep 2008], nearly 5000 cases of dengue fever have been
reported in Ca Mau, including 7 fatal cases. The reason is poor rural
environmental sanitation, which created breeding grounds for
mosquitoes to multiply, causing the disease to spread quickly.

An outbreak of dengue fever has hit Fiji, one of New Zealand's main
tourist destinations. The country's Ministry of Health, Women and
Social Welfare has confirmed 9 cases have occurred in the past
fortnight. It said there have been no confirmed deaths but there has
been an increase in clinic visits and hospital admissions. Fiji joins
New Caledonia, Tonga, Kiribati and the Cook Islands [as localities
with dengue cases? - Mod. TY].

There is no vaccine available for dengue and the only preventative
measures available are insect repellent and long sleeved clothing,
particularly in the early evening. Mosquito nets are also recommended.
