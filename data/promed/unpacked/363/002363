Rare disease killing dogs at shelter
------------------------------------
The Logan County Humane Society was quarantined after 5 dogs died from
an extremely rare disease. Veterinarians said it was an upper
respiratory disease that came from a virus that mutated from horses.
It was so rare that less than a handful of outbreaks had been reported
across the country. Officials believe a dog may have brought the
disease into the shelter from outside.

All 175 dogs were placed under close supervision at the shelter.
Executive Director Lori Plummer said her staff was extremely puzzled
when they found 5 of their furry companions dead in their kennels last
week. "It was a very kind of messy scene in his kennel," Plummer said.
"There was a lot of blood and things of that nature that we're not
used to seeing."

Veterinarians said the dogs died from a rare form of streptococcus,
one that led to hemorragic pneumonia. Within 10-12 hours,
veterinarians said the dog's chest cavities filled up with blood,
leading to their death. It was an airborne bacterium that was not
contagious [to humans].

A sign outside the shelter said it was closed to the public. Plummer
said they had to minimize foot traffic inside the facility to reduce
he spread of the disease. Behind closed doors, Plummer said her staff
was working around the clock to clean the place and care for all 175
animals. They were giving 2 doses of penicillin to every dog in the
shelter. "This has probably tripled our workload due to the intensity
of having to give injections twice a day to the 175 animals we have in
our facility," said Plummer.

The cost of all this is expected to be about USD 8000. Plummer said
other shelters that had seen a similar outbreak of this disease acted
by euthanizing all dogs and cats inside. Plummer said she had no plans
to euthanize any animal in her shelter unless they were really ill.
"Because our mission as a humane society is to save animals, and to
save their lives. It's rare, it's unusual. It's a unique situation. In
our eyes we have to do everything we can to save them," said Plummer.

The humane society was struggling to pay for the extra staff, and
medications for the dogs. They begged for community support and
donations. Those who would like to help, can mail in their donations
to the Humane Society of Logan County, 2521 U.S Highway 68N,
Bellefontaine OH 43311. The shelter is expected to reopen the public
on 16 Dec 2009.

[_Streptococcus zooepidemicus_ is generally regarded as the causative
agent of hemorrhagic pneumonia in dogs. It seems to be a very lethal
disease capable of spreading rapidly through colonies of dogs, such as
enclosed research animals, animal shelters, and other gathering of
dogs. The organism is capable of producing septic thrombi seen in the
small vessels of the kidneys, lymph nodes, spleen, brain, and adrenal
glands.

Aggressive symptomatic and supportive care is necessary. There may be
specific treatment recommendations as we learn more about this
disease. Infection control, such as limiting human traffic, footbaths,
changing gloves between animals, are all things that can help reduce
the spread of this disease.
