Fourteen tissue samples from wild Iowa deer tested positive for chronic wasting disease [CWD], bringing the total deer testing positive for CWD in Iowa to 44. The Iowa Department of Natural Resources is waiting for results on follow-up tests for 2 suspect samples that could raise the total positives for the year [2018] to 16. The deer tissue was collected primarily during the fall from hunter-harvested and road-killed deer.

The way that this disease moves, these results were not unexpected, according to Todd Bishop, chief of the Iowa Department of Natural Resources Wildlife Bureau.

Eight positive deer were confirmed in Allamakee County, 4 in Clayton County, 1 (plus 2 suspects) in Wayne County, and, for the 1st time, 1 in Dubuque County. The Dubuque County deer was a roadkill, 2.5 mi [4 km] southeast of the city limits.

Bishop says hunters are doing an excellent job harvesting deer and providing samples in DNR's priority areas, areas where the disease had been confirmed before. The DNR wants to slow this down as best they can while still having high-quality deer hunting, hoping science can provide some solutions down the road, according to Bishop

More than 6800 tissue samples were collected during the 2018 deer season. The DNR contacted each hunter whose deer tested positive and offered to collect the meat and any remaining bones and tissue. Hunters turned over the meat in every case. The collected material was bagged, sealed, then disposed in a local landfill.

CWD was 1st confirmed in the Midwest in Wisconsin in 2001 about 75 mi [121 km] from the Iowa state line and has since been confirmed in every other state bordering Iowa. The Iowa DNR began monitoring for the disease in 2002, with an emphasis on counties nearest where it was confirmed in the wild, and has tested more than 74 000 deer since. The disease was 1st confirmed in Iowa near Harpers Ferry in Allamakee County in 2013.

CWD is a neurological disease belonging to the family of diseases known as transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), or prion diseases. It attacks the brain of infected deer, causing the animal to lose weight, display abnormal behavior, lose body functions, and die. It is always fatal to the infected animal.

The Iowa DNR has more information about CWD and other infectious disease online at <www.iowadnr.gov/cwd>.

[There is at least one new county in this report. The disease is spreading. Because the disease is spreading, there are those who fear it will completely take over the cervid population and eventually kill them off, or the disease will spread to humans. There is currently no proof of either situation, but caution is warranted if you are a deer hunter. If you hunt in an area offering it, testing may be worth your while. - Mod.TG
