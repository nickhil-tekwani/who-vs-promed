Rabbit hemorrhagic disease, Mexico
----------------------------------
Information received on Fri 10 Apr 2020 from Dr. Gay Gutierrez Juan, Director-General of Animal Health, National Service of Health, Safety and Agro-Food Quality (SENASICA), Secretary of Agriculture and Rural Development (SADER), Mexico City, Mexico

Summary
Report type: Immediate notification
Date of start of the event: 3 Apr 2020
Date of confirmation of the event: 8 Apr 2020
Report date: 9 Apr 2020
Date submitted to OIE: 10 Apr 2020
Reason for notification: Recurrence of a listed disease
Date of previous occurrence: 1991
Manifestation of disease: Clinical disease
Causal agent: Rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus
Serotype: Not typed
Nature of diagnosis: Clinical, laboratory (advanced)
This event pertains to a defined within the country.

New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks:
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak location: Nuevo Casa Grandes, Chihuahua
Date of start of the outbreak: 3 Apr 2020
Outbreak status: Continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: Backyard
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Rabbits / 30 / 13 / 11 / 19 / 0
Affected population: A backyard with 30 adult animals for reproduction/breeding detected following sudden deaths and clinical signs suggesting the disease (dyspnea, nasal bleeding).

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Rabbits / 43.33 / 36.67 / 84.62 / 100
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comment: The affected backyard has been depopulated, and cleaning and disinfection are ongoing. Following the epidemiological investigation, 2 in-contact premises were identified, but no evidence of the disease was found; however, as a precautionary measure, they will be depopulated. The zone around the outbreak has been expanded in order to further detect other cases. It is important to emphasize that this is not a rabbit breeding zone at the national level and the population is very limited.

Control measures
Measures applied: Surveillance within containment and/or protection zone; quarantine; official disposal of carcasses, by-products and waste; stamping out; disinfection; vaccination prohibited; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: Surveillance outside containment and/or protection zone

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
SENASICA Biosafety Laboratory Level 3 (national laboratory) / Rabbits / Haemagglutination (HA) test / 8 Apr 2020 / Positive
SENASICA Biosafety Laboratory Level 3 (national laboratory) / Rabbits / Reverse transcription - polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) / 8 Apr 2020 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

["Rabbit hemorrhagic disease is caused by rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV), a member of the genus _Lagovirus_ and family Caliciviridae. There are many strains of RHDV, and 3 major viral subtypes: RHDV ("classical RHDV"), the antigenic variant RHDVa, and the recently emerged virus RHDV2 (also called RHDVb). Classical RHDV and RHDVa comprise one serotype, while RHDV2 belongs to a different serotype.

"In rabbits less than 4-8 weeks of age, RHDV/RHDVa infections are usually subclinical. However, some young rabbits may have elevated temperatures, and subclinical signs of liver disease were noted in experimentally infected 4-week-old rabbit kittens. Deaths have also been reported, though rarely. In a recent study, experimentally infected 4-week-old rabbits died rapidly if they were immunosuppressed with corticosteroids.

"Peracute and acute disease are the most common syndromes in older rabbits. In peracute cases, infected rabbits develop a fever and die suddenly within 12-36 hours of its onset. The only clinical signs may be terminal squeals followed rapidly by collapse and death. Animals with the acute form survive somewhat longer, with signs of dullness/apathy, anorexia, congestion of the conjunctiva, and/or prostration. These animals may also develop neurological signs, such as incoordination, excitement, opisthotonos and paddling. Some rabbits turn and flip quickly in their cages; this can resemble convulsions or mania. There may also be respiratory signs (e.g., dyspnea, cyanosis and a terminal, bloodstained, frothy nasal discharge), lacrimation, ocular hemorrhages or epistaxis. Animals that survive longer can develop a subacute form with severe jaundice, accompanied by weight loss and lethargy, and die in a few weeks. These animals may have diarrhea or constipation and abdominal dilatation just before death. A small number of adult rabbits can have milder signs, with a higher survival rate, or are infected subclinically. Rabbits with persistent viral RNA were apparently healthy. Iberian hares infected with classical RHDV were found dead but had lesions consistent with a disease caused by a lagovirus.

"RHDV2 affects young rabbits as well as older animals; clinical cases have been reported in rabbits as young as 11 days of age. The clinical signs are similar to the illness caused by RHDV/RHDVa; however, experimentally infected rabbits generally survived longer, and peracute or acute cases were less common. A captive Italian hare infected with RHDV2 had no clinical signs other than epistaxis before death. Wild Cape hares infected with this virus were found dead.

"Rabbit hemorrhagic disease is endemic in Australia, New Zealand, Cuba, parts of Asia and Africa, and most of Europe. The viral subtypes circulating in each region can differ. As of 2016, RHDV2 has been found in a number of European countries and Australia. RHDV is not thought to be established in North America, where _O. cuniculus_ does not occur in the wild. Outbreaks were reported among domesticated rabbits in the USA in 2000 (Iowa), 2001 (Utah, Illinois, New York), 2005 (Indiana), 2008 (Maryland) and 2010 (Minnesota). In some cases, only a single facility or household was affected. The origins of these viruses could not be traced; however, different viruses were involved in each outbreak, and they were thought to have come from outside North America. In 2011, a clinical case occurred in Canada, in one of 3 rabbits that had been housed indoors for more than a year. The source of this virus is also unknown, although various hypotheses (i.e., reactivation of a persistent infection, emergence from a nonpathogenic calicivirus or transmission from an unknown source on fomites or insects) have been proposed. RHDV was endemic in domesticated rabbits in Mexico from the late 1980s to 1991, but it was eventually eradicated. This disease was also reported from domesticated and wild rabbits in Uruguay in 2004; however, Uruguay ceased vaccination for this disease in 2007, and declared itself free of RHDV to the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) in 2012.

"There is no indication that RHDV infects humans." (Source: http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/rabbit_hemorrhagic_disease.pdf). - Mod.CRD
