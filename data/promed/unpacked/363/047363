West Nile Virus-positive Mountain Goats and Sheep: Clinical Signs
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The 6-year-old Suffolk ewe was located in a small farm flock in the
northeastern part of the state. When first noticed she was febrile
(104 to 106 degrees F), with hind-limb paralysis and progressed to
convulsions. She died 2 days after onset of clinical signs and was
the only animal in a small farm flock that showed any clinical signs.
The Rocky Mountain goat flock is located in the north-central part of
the state. The flock consisted of 12 head of males and females, that
ranged in age from 16 months to 2 years age. During a 2-week period,
7 of the goats showed neurological signs and died. Clinical signs
included horizontal nystagmus, ataxia, head tilt, and lateral
recumbency. The 5 remaining goats did not show any clinical signs.
