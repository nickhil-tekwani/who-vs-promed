A suspected Congo virus [Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever] patient brought to Quetta's Fatima Jinnah Chest Hospital passed away on [Sat 3 Aug 2019], while another believed to be suffering from the disease was admitted.

The patient belonging to Loralai district was admitted to the hospital on [Thu 1 Aug 2019] bleeding from mouth and nose and with high fever. A blood sample of the patient had been dispatched to Karachi for diagnosis but he did not survive and died before the results were concluded.

Another patient from Pishin district suffering from the same symptoms was brought to Fatima Jinnah Chest Hospital and had been diagnosed with Congo virus, the Head of the Congo ward said.

In the last 4 months, 25 patients suspected of having Congo fever have been brought to the hospital from different areas of the province and 12 of them have been confirmed as suffering from the disease after diagnosis.

In recent years, the Congo virus has hit Balochistan on the occasion of Eid-ul-Azha [Festival of the Sacrifice], as most of the affected patients had been engaged in the business of herding.

Although the current Balochistan government has yet to take any serious measures to counter the disease, governments in the past have been taking preemptive measures to stop the spread of the virus including spraying in cattle markets.

[The ICTV has changed the classification scheme for Bunyaviridae, now Bunyavirales. In ICTV 2018b, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever orthonairovirus (CCHFV) is a member of the genus _Orthonairovirus_, family Nairoviridae of RNA viruses.

CCHFV is transmitted by ticks, predominantly _Hyalomma_, which are both a reservoir and a vector for the virus. Numerous wild and domestic animals, such as cattle, goats, sheep and hares, serve as amplifying hosts for the virus. Transmission to humans occurs through contact with infected ticks or animal blood. CCHF can be transmitted from one infected human to another by contact with infectious blood or body fluids. Documented spread of CCHF has also occurred in hospitals due to improper sterilization of medical equipment, reuse of injection needles, and contamination of medical supplies. (CDC)]

A scoping review of the literature on CCHF in Pakistan discusses why the country is at such high risk for outbreaks.

"Abstract
--------
Pakistan has faced a number of significant healthcare challenges over the past decade. In 2000, one of these events -- a deadly epidemic of Crimean Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) -- struck Pakistan. The people of Pakistan are at a very high risk of acquiring CCHF, due to a number of factors which emerge from a scoping review of the literature. First, the underdeveloped healthcare system of the country is currently not prepared to cope with challenges of this nature. Healthcare professionals and medical institutes are not sufficiently equipped to properly diagnose, manage, and prevent CCHF. Second, a large percentage of the general public is unaware of the spread and control of the vector. The agricultural sector of Pakistan is vast and thus many people are involved in animal husbandry and the handling of livestock which can lead to the transmission of the CCHF virus. Even in urban areas the risk of transmission is significantly higher around the time of Eid-ul-Azha, when Muslims slaughter animals. Finally, the political upheavals faced by the country have also increased Pakistan's vulnerability because a large number of refugees from Afghanistan, a CCHF endemic country, have migrated to Pakistan as a result of the Afghan war. Most of the refugees and their animals settle in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa provinces, which consequently have a higher prevalence of CCHF. This scoping review of the literature highlights the potential causes of high risk CCHF and draws conclusions and makes recommendations that policy-makers in Pakistan may wish to consider in-order to improve on the current situation." - Mod.LK
