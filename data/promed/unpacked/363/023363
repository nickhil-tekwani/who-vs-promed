DRC: pneumonic plague kills 43
------------------------------
Some 43 people have died and 13 others [been] infected following an
outbreak of pneumonic plague in the mining area of Zobia, in the region of
Bas-Uele in Oriental Province, eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC),
an official in the Ministry of Health told IRIN on Mon 21 Feb 2005.
The ministry's director of epidemiology, Dr Benoit Kebele Ilunga, said the
epidemic showed up 3 weeks ago in one of the mines in the diamond rich
area. He said the 13 infected survivors had responded well to antibiotics.
Samples from the infected people analysed at the Bio Medical Research
Institute in the capital, Kinshasa, confirmed the plague.
A medical team comprised of representatives from the NGO Doctors Without
Borders [presumably Medecins sans Frontieres! - Mod.SH], Medair, the World
Health Organization, and the Ministry of Health had assessed the situation
in the area, Ilunga said. Another team of experts, made up of specialists
from the WHO in Geneva and its African offices, and from the Pasteur
Institute in Madagascar, also conducted further studies at the site of the
epidemic.
"The epidemic of pneumonic plague is well confirmed in this area," Dr
Jean-Marie Yanehogo, in charge of epidemics at WHO, said. "The WHO sent a
research team to gather all available evidence."
A major challenge for health officials in DRC that remains is how to
contain the epidemic. Kebele said the major difficulty was to find all the
people who may have contracted the infection and who may have left the
Zobia mine while the disease was still in its incubation period. "They
[people] may develop the disease in another mine, and so, propagate the
epidemic," Kebele said.
Some 7000 miners live in Zobia. Medical officials are now looking for 2000
of them who worked in Zobia when the epidemic broke out. The mine was
closed in 2004 when several cases of plague were detected. However, the
mine was reopened on 14 Dec 2004, but only a week later, new cases of the
plague reappeared.

DR Congo plague outbreak spreads
--------------------------------
An outbreak of what tests suggest is pneumonic plague has spread to a 2nd
town in the Democratic Republic of Congo, according to a medical charity.
Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) says it believes it has found a case in a
2nd area in the north east.
Thousands have fled the remote diamond mining town of Zobia since the
disease first emerged at the end of 2004. At least 60 people have died so
far. The plague affects victims lungs and is fatal if left untreated.
"People have been leaving Zobia. They were starting to panic - its
contagious," MSF's Meike Steensens told BBC News from the city of
Kisangani. The outbreak began just 4 days after the diamond mine reopened
near Zobia, in Oriental province, north of the country's biggest city,
Kisangani, a major trading center on the Congo River. Those who have died
are all diamond miners. Another 350 miners have been infected.
MSF discovered the new case in the town of Buta after sending an emergency
team of doctors to the area. Final confirmation of the plague is expected
next week, MSF say, but initial tests indicate that they are dealing with
an outbreak of pneumonic plague. An advance team of medical experts from
the WHO has already visited the area to confirm that people are infected
with the plague.
Around 7 000 people worked at the mine. The WHO team will focus on trying
to trace the 2 000 who have left since the start of the outbreak. Bubonic
plague is endemic in parts of Africa, including the DR Congo, but pneumonic
plague, which occurs when bacteria infect the lung, has a very high
fatality rate and is "invariably" deadly when left untreated, WHO said.
Humans are generally infected with plague by rodents and fleas, but the
pneumonic form of the disease can also be transmitted from person to person
through respiratory droplets.

MSF has sent 2 teams to an area in northeastern Democratic Republic of
Congo (DRC) where an outbreak of pneumonic plague had been reported. In a
statement issued in Nairobi on Tue 22 Feb 2005, MSF said an exploratory
mission from 14-16 Feb 2005 found 93 cases of the disease in the Dingila
health zone, which includes Zonia, Kana and Mambenge, all in north eastern
Orientale Province.
Reports indicated that the epicentre of the outbreak was in the town of
Zobia, around 190 km from the town of Buta, MSF said. "One MSF team will
focus on Zobia, while the 2nd will follow the main routes," it said. "This
2nd team will identify and treat those that have recently fled Zobia due to
violence and fear of contracting plague."
MSF said the disease was a form of plague, which primarily attacks the
lungs. "While it is endemic to this region of the DRC, the current outbreak
is unusual in the number of people affected," MSF reported.
Plague is caused by the _Yersinia pestis_ bacterium and primarily affects
wild animals such as rats, Alain Decoux, the head of mission for MSF in the
DRC, was quoted as saying. He added: "Since transmission to humans often
occurs due to bites from infected fleas, a commonly held belief is that the
way to stop the spread is to exterminate the rat population. In fact, this
worsens the situation as it deprives the fleas of their blood supply, which
means that they are more likely to seek out alternatives such as humans."
MSF said plague could easily be cured through a course of antibiotics,
provided that the patient was found in time. However, the organization
said, breaking the chain of transmission is difficult as sufferers of
pneumonic plague need to be strictly isolated during the period of their
illness. "Doing so in severely underdeveloped areas, such as around Buta,
is a major challenge," Decoux said. He said the nature of the region
affected made the work of MSF much more difficult. "The fact that Zobia is
a diamond producing area results in a high level of insecurity," he said.
"Clashes between forces in the area coming as recently as 14 Feb 2005
affect the MSF teams, as well as causing the population to scatter widely.
The result is that plague sufferers are hard to identify in time."

[The exact number of deaths from pneumonic plague, which in its primary
form is spread from person to person without the need for infected rodents
or fleas, in the outbreak is either 43 or 60 based on these reports. It is
disconcerting that at least 1 case has arisen (or carried) to another town.
ProMED awaits further word on the scope of the outbreak and new areas of
involvement. - Mod.LL]
