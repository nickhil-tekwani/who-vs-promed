Hand, Foot And Mouth Disease In Malaysia - Update
-------------------------------------------------
A third enterovirus, Echovirus 7 (echo 7), has been identified during the
current outbreak of Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) in Malaysia. This
virus was isolated from a fatal case at the University Hospital Kuala Lumpur
(UHKL). The identification of this virus was conducted by Assoc. Prof. Dr.
Chua Kaw Bing, consultant virologist of UHKL, along with clinical virologist
Dr. Peter McMinn at the Princess Margaret Hospital, Perth.
Using VP4 RT-PCR and sequencing conducted at The Western Australian Centre
for Pathology and Medical Research (PATHCENTRE), Perth, the data generated
were sent to Dr. Hiroaki Ishiko, Infectious Diseases Department,
Mitsubishi-Kagaku Bio-Clinical Laboratories, Tokyo, Japan as he has an
extensive database of VP4 sequence from all 66 human enteroviruses. This
analysis provided an unequivocal match to Echovirus 7. Further confirmation
[was obtained by VP1 RT-PCR and sequencing revealing a close match to a
recent Spanish isolate (94% nucleotide sequence identity) and to the
prototype Wallace strain (89% nucleotide sequence identity).
Neutralization assays were conducted using RD cells and a complete set of
intersecting antiserum pools. This test confirmed the presumptive
identification of echo 7 made by VP4 and VP1 sequencing. A serum
neutralization assay on a convalescent serum from a 7-month old child showed
a high neutralizing titre (320) to isolate 15394 (echo 7) and no
cross-reactivity to the closely related echo 11 (<20). The convalescent
serum from a 5-year old child showed the phenomenon of "original antigenic
sin", with a neutralizing titre of 20 to echo 11 and <20 to the echo 7
virus isolate even though the virus was isolated from this child.
Echo 7 virus has been associated with several outbreaks involving central
nervous system disease. One such outbreak in Pondicherry, India, was
published in 1969 where there were 26 cases of encephalitis with several
deaths. In Sweden in 1973, an outbreak of meningoencephalitis due to echo 7
and Coxsackie B3 was reported and echo 7 was isolated from 19 patients.
There was no fatality during this outbreak.
During the present hand, foot and mouth outbreak, several enteroviruses
have been isolated by UHKL. These included 7 Coxsackie A16, 14 enterovirus
71, one Coxsackie B, 12 herpes simplex and 6 echo 7. However, 5 of the 6
echo 7 virus isolates were from severe and fatal encephalitis. The
identification of echo 7 in severe and fatal cases during an outbreak of
HFMD in Malaysia is of global interest because of the increase in emerging
and re-emerging diseases worldwide.

Hand, Foot & Mouth Disease in Malaysia & Singapore: Virological Findings
------------------------------------
KUALA LUMPUR: On Mon 24 Oct 2000 [it was announced that a virulent
enterovirus never detected before locally had killed [more accurately "been
isolated from" - Mod.CP a child who contracted hand, foot and mouth disease
(HFMD) recently and may have been responsible for the death of 3 others. Dr
Peter McMimm of the Princess Margaret Hospital for Children in Perth,
Australia, confirmed this today after extensive tests in the past 7 days.
Speaking to the New Straits Times in a telephone interview, Dr McMimm said
he was leaving it to the Health Ministry here to reveal the name of the
enterovirus [now identified as Echovirus type 7 in Professor Lam's statement
above - Mod.CP. He said only one of the samples brought to Perth by Dr Chua
of the University Hospital Kuala Lumpur had yielded positive results, [but
the presence of Enterovirus 71 could be excluded.
He added that the precautionary measures carried out by health authorities
in Malaysia were sufficient to contain the disease. Considering that the
number of cases have been declining, the measures taken have been effective.
"This virus [subsequently revealed to be Echovirus type 7, while not
new, is one of the less common strains. Although never before detected in
Malaysia, it has shown up in other parts of the world."
Meanwhile, findings by Singapore's Ministries of Environment; Health;
Community Development and Sports; and Education, released here today said it
was "strongly believed" that Enterovirus 71 (EV71) was the main cause of the
HFMD outbreak in the Republic, although other enteroviruses have also been
isolated. Dr Ling Ai Ee and Dr Chan Kwai Peng, of Singapore General
Hospital's Department Of Pathology, identified EV71 in samples from 2
children who died in the republic on 30 Sep 2000. Their findings [had been
confirmed by the United States' Centers for Disease Control. The
Singaporean virologists also found EV71 present in the samples of surviving
siblings of the 2 children. No virus, however, had been identified in
another child who died on 10 Sep 2000. According to the statement, completed
virological studies showed that 80 per cent of the samples from fatal and
hospitalised cases and contacts had grown enteroviruses, [and EV71 had been
confirmed in almost half of the positive samples. The National University
of Singapore, together with the Virology Laboratory at the General Hospital,
had also found that the sequences of viruses for the fatal cases were
closely related to the EV71 strain associated with the outbreak in the
region in 1997. The statement also said that the number of HFMD cases in
Singapore was declining.

[The question arises whether the fatalities observed in these epidemics of
what is normally a mild disease are determined by infection by a single
enterovirus or a combination of agents. - Mod.CP
