Q fever in the Netherlands: an update on the epidemiology and control measures
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Extent of the problem
------------------------
The Netherlands is facing a Q fever problem that is still increasing
in size since the last report in this journal [Eurosurveillance,
Volume 14, Issue 19, 14 May 2009
<http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=19210>].

In 2009, a total of 2357 new Q fever patients were registered in the
national infectious disease notification database. These patients
fulfilled the case notification criteria of fever, pneumonia, or
hepatitis, combined with a positive laboratory result. Q fever
infection is asymptomatic in 60 percent of cases and if symptomatic
often presents as influenza-like illness. Increasing awareness among
patients and doctors will likely result in detection of more
relatively mild cases.

However, the proportion of notified patients that had to be admitted
to a hospital seems to have stabilised around 20 percent, after a
decline from 2007 to 2008 (For the table, go to the full text at the
above URL). The high percentage of 50 percent in 2007 was largely
influenced by active case finding in a retrospective survey among
hospitalised cases. The 19.7 percent of 2009 are still much higher
than the 2-5 percent hospitalisation that are reported in the
literature.

In the 1st 10 weeks of 2010 a considerable number of cases has
already been notified, which, based on experiences of preceding years
and taking into account the drastic measures taken, was not expected
at this time of year (figure 1 at the above URL). The intensified
media attention in late 2009 and early 2010 might have caused an
increase in the number of consultations. Improved laboratory capacity
will also have influenced the number of notified cases and quality of
the notified data. As can be seen in the epidemiological curve of
2007 there is a more or less scattered pattern due to delayed
notifications. From 2009 onwards, routine PCR is included in the
diagnostic workup of acute Q fever, which can accelerate diagnosis.
However, PCR is only positive in early Q fever.

The high background of notified cases in the winter of 2009-10 may be
a reflection of high seroprevalence among the affected population,
due to persisting antibodies, both IgG and IgM phase II, used to
diagnose acute Q-fever. This, combined with non-specific clinical
symptoms of Q fever, makes it difficult to differentiate between
acute and past Q fever infections, and thus makes notifications less
accurate.

In 2009, 6 deaths were reported, all in patients with other
underlying medical conditions. The median age of the patients was 49
(interquartile range (IQR):38-59), and 61 percent were male. In 2008,
the median age was 50 years (IQR: 41-59), with 64 percent male cases.

Geographically, the epidemic affected an area that was larger than in
the preceding years. A large new cluster was observed in Limburg, the
southernmost province of the Netherlands, near a Q fever-affected
dairy goat farm. There is consensus among public health and
veterinary professionals that most of the human Q fever cases are
linked to abortion waves on large dairy goat farms, and to a much
lesser extent on dairy sheep farms. Consequently, interventions have
focused on these types of farms. However, there are indications that
direct contact with non-dairy sheep has also caused a limited number
of human cases: at least 28 among patients and staff of a mental
health institution and possibly up to 46 among 12 000 people who
visited a sheep farm during the lambing season in February and March
2009.

2. Control measures
-------------------
In February 2009, a nationwide hygiene protocol became mandatory for
professional dairy goat and dairy sheep farms. Between April and
November 2009, approximately 250 000 small ruminants were mandatorily
vaccinated, including those on farms in the high incidence area in
the south of the country (Figure 2 at the above URL), farms with a
recent history of Q fever, and farms offering recreational
activities. Veterinarians, physicians and the public were informed
through targeted mailings, publications and the media. On 1 Oct 2009,
bulk milk monitoring became mandatory on farms with more than 50
dairy goats or dairy sheep, and PCR positive bulk milk has since been
used as an additional criterion for veterinary notification of Q
fever.

The initial frequency of testing each farm every other month has been
increased to once every 2 weeks as of 14 Dec 2009. By 18 Feb 2010, 74
dairy goat farms and 2 dairy sheep farms, out of the total of 360
dairy goat farms and 40 dairy sheep farms with more than 50 animals
in the Netherlands, had been declared Q fever-infected based on
PCR-positive bulk milk testing. The number of positive farms is
expected to increase further towards the peak of the lambing season
(March-April). [As of 18 Apr 2010, the total number of positive farms
has increased by 7, becoming 83, of which 81 dairy goats (22.5
percent of 360) and 2 dairy sheep (5 percent). - Mod.AS]

In retrospect, a large human cluster in an urban area in 2008 could
clearly be linked to a dairy goat farm (with over 400 animals) with a
Q fever related abortion wave a few weeks before the first human
cases presented. People living within 2 km of the farm had a much
higher risk for Q fever than those living more than 5 km away
(relative risk 31.1; 95 percent confidence interval (CI): 16.4-59.1).
Based on this study, a public information campaign has been targeted
to zones of increased risk around affected farms. When a dairy goat
or dairy sheep farm tests positive for _Coxiella burnetii_ in a bulk
milk sample for the 1st time, all inhabitants living within a radius
of 5 km of the farm receive a letter informing them on the presence
of a Q fever-positive farm in their proximity.

The letter gives no specific advice, but allows people with known
risk factors to avoid the farm. [See commentary below]. The list of
positive farms is updated daily and is available to the public on the
website of the Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority [Go to the
web-site
<http://www.vwa.nl/onderwerpen/dierziekten/dossier/4833780/q-koorts_kaart-met-overzicht-van-besmette-bedrijven>;
for the map, click on 'Kaart overzicht besmettingen Q-koorts'; for
the listed positive farms, on 'Adres locaties besmette bedrijven
Q-koorts'].

In 2009, 59 percent of the notified human Q fever cases lived within
a radius of 5 km of an infected dairy goat or dairy sheep farm, while
only 12 percent of the Dutch population live within these zones. The
incidence of Q fever in 2009 was 69 per 100 000 population within,
and 6 per 100 000 outside the 5 km-areas.

Screening of pregnant women
---------------------------
International literature suggests that a Q fever infection during
pregnancy may lead to adverse pregnancy outcome in a large percentage
of cases. However, in a recently completed retrospective study in the
high incidence area in the Netherlands, the presence of antibodies
against _C. burnetii_ in early pregnancy was not significantly
associated with preterm delivery, low birth weight, or perinatal
mortality (van der Hoek et al., unpublished data). A large-scale
prospective screening and treatment study coordinated by the
University Medical Centre Groningen, was started in March 2010, aimed
at providing more conclusive data on the need to screen pregnant
women in high incidence areas.

Screening of blood donors
-------------------------
There is a theoretical risk for transmission of _C. burnetii_ through
blood transfusion. Preliminary results indicate that in 2009, _C.
burnetii_ DNA was detected in a small minority of blood donations in
the affected area. The risk of infection is probably negligible, but
as a precautionary measure, Sanquin Blood Supply Foundation, the
organisation responsible for all blood products in the Netherlands,
started screening donated blood for _C. burnetii_ in the
high-incidence area of the country on 15 March 2010.

Expectations for 2010
---------------------
The veterinary interventions, especially vaccination, animal movement
restrictions, culling and hygiene measures, are expected to have an
impact in 2010 and 2011. However, the resilience of _C. burnetii_ in
the environment and the possible role of animal species other than
small ruminants make a prediction difficult but could potentially
lead to incidence levels not much lower or even higher than those
observed in 2009. If spores persist in stables even after removing
all animals or if environmental contamination and different animal
reservoirs turn out to become relatively more important for
transmission to humans, the striking seasonal pattern of the years
2007-2009 may be altered, possibly resulting in a more erratic
transmission pattern over time. So far, there are no signs that the Q
fever problem is spreading to neighbouring countries. It could be
that factors such as lower population density, lower animal density,
and different animal production methods in Belgium and G!
ermany, compared to the Netherlands, play a role.

Research agenda
---------------
To fill the many knowledge gaps regarding Q fever, there is a large
interdisciplinary research agenda in the Netherlands focusing on
human and veterinary public health and individual patient care.
Further elucidating the source and transmission routes will to a
large extent depend on advances in molecular biology.

Conclusive matching of the bacteria that are found in animals with
human and environmental samples has not yet been successful.
Obtaining _C. burnetii_ DNA is difficult, except from placenta
material of infected goats and sheep. Typing by multiple-locus
variable number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) has been used on a
limited scale in human and veterinary samples and indicated
similarity in strains isolated from a small sheep herd with strains
from the human cluster in the mental health institution in May 2008.

However, while various different MLVA types were identified, research
by the Central Veterinary Institute in Lelystad shows that one MLVA
type prevails on many dairy goat farms in the high risk area in the
southern part of the Netherlands, possibly indicating clonal spread
in this area. This hampers tracing the source of human Q fever in the
high-risk area to a specific farm. In a newly started project, whole
genome sequencing will be used to be able to distinguish between
Coxiella bacteria from different sources.

Discussion
----------
Q fever is now considered a major public health problem in the
Netherlands and has recently led to drastic measures, including the
large-scale culling of pregnant goats and sheep. Despite the
strictest veterinary measures possible, Q fever is expected to remain
a significant problem over the coming years. The control measures are
aimed at stabilising the number of human cases in 2010, while the
sustained compulsory vaccination campaign in small ruminants which is
implemented in 2010 nationwide for target farms, is expected to
eventually cause a drop in human cases in 2011 and subsequent years.

abridged and edited]
<http://www.minlnv.nl/portal/page?_pageid=116,1640336&_dad=portal&_schema=PORTAL&p_subject=&p_month=0&p_year=0&p_submit=&p_page=3>

On Wed, 7 Apr 2010, the Minister of Agriculture answered a list of
questions from Members of Parliament (MPs). Selected items and
additional information, derived from the web-site of the Ministry of
Agriculture, are included in the following report.

1. The 'van Dijk Q fever Evaluation Commission' report, addressing
the Dutch Q-fever epidemic and its handling, will be presented in
September 2010. Initially, the report was due before summer 2010; see
20100112.0144.

2. Female goats/sheep, not culled in positive holdings since they
were not pregnant, are liable to life-long breeding ban. The minister
has appealed to non-contaminated farms to increase their available
crop of female animals for breeding, needed for the re-population of
affected farms.

3. There are indications that vegetation, moist soil conditions and
farm management contribute to increased infection rate of humans and
animals. Research is still ongoing.

4. There is no clarity as yet if specific _C. burnetii_ strains are
responsible for the Dutch Q fever epidemic. So far, 14 different
bacterium types have been identified.

5. Farms that have been negative for a year are no direct risk to
public health. However, the risk for public health around a farm that
was contaminated and then (after a year) declared disease-free, is
not totally absent since the bacterium may still persist in the
environment. There is not yet a risk profile for the environment
around a previously contaminated farm.

6. About 80 percent of the goat-holders and their family members have
been found infected. The infection rate with the general Dutch
population is 2.4 percent. These are the preliminary results of 2
studies. These data are not surprising; the disease is known to be
present in the Netherlands since the late 1950's, though on a
low-endemic level in the general public.

7. There are no data of how many animals that were vaccinated in 2008
and 2009 are still on the farms; therefore, it is not known yet how
many animals will need the booster vaccination this year.

8. As of now [7 Apr 2010], 225 000 vaccine doses have been delivered
to veterinary practices for application this year.

9. The expert advisory group will reconvene end May to decide upon
possible mitigation of the breeding ban and the introduction of
breeding animals to flocks.

10. Advice on the possible use of a human Q fever vaccine, for groups
at risk, is expected before summer 2010 from the Public Health
Council. The Australian vaccine is the only existing vaccine and used
only for workers in the industry. Therefore there is no experience
with vaccinating people with specific health risks.

11. The veterinary vaccine is being tested for efficiency at the EMA
[the European Medicines Agency, formerly known as EMEA]. Furthermore,
the GD [Animal Health Service] has tested the vaccine and concluded
that the chance of infection has been reduced in view of most animals
been vaccinated, abortions almost completely eliminated and excretion
of the bacterium considerably reduced. More information will be
available in due course.

12. Based on these data, the experts believe that in the absence of
research findings indicative of possible new deleterious
developments, there are sufficient indications to stop the breeding
and supplying ban, to stop culling and to reduce the frequency of
bulk milk testing.

13. There is a difference in Q-fever control measures required for
dairy farms in comparison to mutton farms. The reason is that there
are no indications that non-dairy farms have caused human infections.
The physiological reasons have not been sufficiently investigated but
could be related to differences in hormone and energy factors.

14. With 3 studies into the effect of antibiotics on Q-fever, there
are no indications that their application will reduce abortion or
agent's excretion. There is however the risk of developed resistance
against the antibiotic, as studies have shown.

15. There has been some commotion around vaccination these past days.
Farmers have become reluctant to vaccinate, related to rumors that
the vaccine could cause positive bulk milk tests with subsequent
cullings. Based on a limited test (by the Jeroen Bosch Hospital on 6
animals) it appears that after vaccination some DNA from _C.
burnetii_ shows in milk samples during the first 9 post-vaccination
days. There was no indication that farms have been erroneously
culled. However, this was a limited test and therefore the CVI and
RIVM have been asked by the ministers to further investigate this
issue on a larger scale. We hope that this research by the CVI and
RIVM will either give more clarity.

In addition: before a farm is declared positive, 3 samples must all
have a positive result:
1- testing by the GD (Animal Health service)
2- confirmation of the same sample by the CVI (Central Veterinarian Institute)
3- the sampling by the VWA (Food Safety Authority)

The time lapse between the 3 tests (in particular Nos 1 and 3) has
always been more than 9 days (excluding tests of animals vaccinated 2
months before sampling).

16. A study on cows in France showed that they became Q-fever free
after 4 years of vaccinations. It is too early to state the same
effectivity for the Netherlands, because the different circumstances.
The minister expects a much sooner (than 4 years) effect of
vaccination in Dutch small ruminants, because of the strict measures
taken in the Netherlands.

17. The regulations for storing and dispersing manure from Q-fever
contaminated farms have been adjusted. Contaminated farms are obliged
to keep the manure, covered, at the farm and until at least 1 Jun
2010. The regulations for not-contaminated farms have not been
changed: they may disperse the manure, when stored under coverage for
90 days on the farm.

18. Ministers Verburg (LNV/Agriculture) en Klink (VWS/Public health)
have decided to adjust the manure regulations for contaminated farms
in order to limit the risk of spreading the Q-fever bacterium,
potentially affecting public health.

19. To eliminate the Q-fever bacterium in manure, dairy goat and
sheep farmers with more than 50 animals must store and cover the
manure, facilitating the composting process. Due to this process the
temperature inside the covered heap rises, and the bacterium
eliminated. In contaminated premises, the period of manure storage
has been prolonged to 150 days.

20. Other regulations have changed as well. One of them addressed the
discontinued obligation to isolate parturient sheep or goats in dairy
goat and sheep farms, with more than 50 animals and with a public
function. This is decided because these farms have to participate in
the fortnightly bulk milk testing procedure. However, these farms may
allow visitors only after timely and full vaccination.

[The number of Dutch citizens, living within a radius of 5 km of
positive farms, to whom a letter informing on the presence of a Q
fever-positive farm in their proximity has been sent, as updated by
the Ministers on 7 Apr 2010, is one million (the total population of
the Netherlands is 16.5 million).

The ministers have provided also some financial data related to the Q
fever event. So far, 45 000 animals have been culled, for which
compensations to the owners were 23 million Euros. The costs of the
control measures application, including culling, disinfection,
evaluation, transportation etc have been 11 million Euros. The costs
for vaccination, bulk tank tests and research for 2010 will,
reportedly, be 8 million Euros (this sum seems somewhat
underestimated; does it indeed cover all the relevant 2010
activities?!). Costs related to human health and economy at large
(e.g., hospitalisation, sick days, job loss, etc.) have not been
calculated yet.

Subscribers are encouraged to visit the 15 presentations of the
International Q fever Conference, Breda, the Netherlands, 25-26 Feb
2010. The conference was convened by the Central Veterinary
Institute, the Animal Health Service Deventer and the Ministry of
Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality. The purpose of the conference
was to collect and share the worldwide knowledge about Q fever in
order to find a continuing policy to fight against Q fever. Available
