The Health Ministry announces a nationwide dengue [alert] with 819
cases and 3 deaths, 2 in Malacca and one in Penang. Health deputy
director-general Datuk Dr Hasan Abdul Rahman said an additional 99
cases were reported last week bringing the total to 819 cases.

Stating that the increase was drastic, he added that if the public do
not take the necessary precautions, the number of cases could increase
to 1600 next month [Dec 2009].

He was speaking to reporters after a dialogue session on the dengue cases.

Hanoi: 2 more die of dengue fever
---------------------------------
Dengue fever has killed 2 more patients in Hanoi, reported the Hanoi
Department of Health on [19 Nov 2009]. The victims are a 53-year-old
woman in Ha Dong district and a 15-year-old boy in Dong Anh district.
In late September [2009], the capital also had 2 fatal cases.

Following accusations of covering the number of deaths, the Health
Ministry asked the Hanoi Department of Health, the National Hospital
of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, and the Bach Mai Hospital to
verify the number.

After the check, the Hanoi Department of Health confirmed the official
figures were accurate. The numbers of people suffering dengue fever in
Hanoi are going down. However, there are still several serious cases
infected with [dengue] virus type 2.

According to the Health Ministry, Viet Nam had more than 77 000 dengue
fever patients in 33 out of 63 provinces and cities in January-October
[2009] period. The number of patients rose by 7.3 percent year-on-year
while the number of deaths fell by over 11 percent.

Notably, the number of dengue fever patients in the southern region
was reduced in both the number of cases and deaths while there were
increases in other regions in the country, especially the north, where
figures were 4-fold.

[Although the monsoon ends and winter has started to set in, the
number of dengue cases is still increasing in the northern part of
Viet Nam. As of 24 Oct 2009, 74 242 cases and 58 deaths were
identified since January 2009, with 17 140 cases and 14 deaths
reported during September 2009 (see prior PRO/MBDS posting Dengue -
Viet Nam (17) 20091025.3677). To date, more than 77 000 cases of
dengue infection have been reported in Viet Nam from January to
October 2009.

2 new cases of dengue fever have been confirmed in north Queensland.
Authorities launched a warning 2 weeks ago after 3 cases of imported
dengue fever were confirmed in Cairns and one case was detected in
Townsville.

Queensland Health says it is on the alert for more cases of dengue
fever in the state's north. Dr Steven Donohue, from the Department's
Tropical Population Health, says 2 more locally acquired cases of
dengue have been found in the Townsville suburb of Heatley. "They
haven't travelled anywhere, which is a worry because we've been
concerned that this could be the start of another big dengue
outbreak," he said. "They got sick around the end of October, early
November [2009], and it did take a little while to find out what they
had.

"But fortunately we think now that we can link them both to a person
who's come from overseas sick and probably also had dengue." Dr
Donohue says he does not know if more cases will emerge. "We're not
exactly sure because although we've done intensive mosquito control
now around all of those households," he said, "the problem is they
weren't diagnosed immediately and therefore there has been an
opportunity since then for it to spread further, so we've sent
warnings to all the doctors."

No more cases of dengue have been confirmed in Cairns.

University of Florida mosquito researchers are watching with a wary
eye as dengue virus returns to the state after more than 50 years. By
late last week, 20 cases of locally transmitted dengue had been
confirmed in Key West. Monroe County officials have issued a health
alert and launched an education campaign urging residents to eliminate
water sources in and around their homes where mosquitoes can breed.

"We haven't seen dengue in Florida in a long time, but this does give
us evidence that we can have it again," said Roxanne Connelly, an
associate professor of medical entomology with UF's [University of
Florida's] Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences.

Besides the dengue re-emergence in the Florida Keys, Connelly, based
at the Florida Medical Entomology Laboratory in Vero Beach, said
health officials were surprised by a door-to-door survey of Key West
residents. Connelly and Jonathan Day, a medical entomology professor
at the Vero Beach laboratory, collaborate with the health and
vector-control officials. After some 240 residents allowed health
officials to draw a small blood sample, test results showed that 41
percent had been exposed to the dengue virus or other Flavivirus,
either through exposure to one of the viruses or through vaccinations,
such as the yellow fever vaccine. [This is a key point. Flavivirus
antibodies are notoriously cross-reactive in many serological tests.
The tests used in the serological survey are not specified. Other
flaviviruses are endemic in Florida, including West Nile and St. Louis
encephalitis viruses. - Mod.TY] "Much like a lot of other
mosquito-borne diseases, some people can have it and no!
t have any symptoms, while others end up very sick," Connelly said.

The last big dengue epidemic in Florida was in 1934 and left more than
25 000 Floridians ill, Day said. Researchers don't expect this
outbreak to reach beyond Monroe County, but it's a strong reminder for
Floridians to be on guard.

Dengue is spread by 2 mosquito species, commonly known as the yellow
fever mosquito and Asian tiger mosquito. Both lay eggs on the sides of
water-filled containers. The yellow fever mosquito is mostly confined
to South Florida, while the Asian tiger mosquito is found throughout
the state, though not in the Florida Keys.

The yellow fever mosquito is prevalent in the Old Town part of Key
West, Day said, and has an affinity for a local cemetery full of
rain-catching urns and vases. Many of the recent dengue cases were in
the Old Town area, he said. Unlike many mosquitoes that are active in
the morning and evening, the yellow fever and Asian tiger mosquitoes
are unusual in that they will bite in broad daylight.

Connelly advises residents to take a careful look at their homes and
yards, looking for even tiny amounts of standing water. Boat tarps,
birdbaths, gutters, empty soda cans -- anything that will hold water
should be suspect and emptied or discarded. Pet dishes emptied every
few days aren't a worry, she said. And while it's not as common,
residents can inadvertently breed mosquitoes indoors, she said. One
way: Small decorative bamboo plants hold just enough water to interest
a mosquito looking to lay eggs.

Other suggestions for residents include wearing long pants and sleeves
when possible and wearing a repellent that includes the active
ingredient DEET.

Dengue alert: Public Health identified dengue [virus] 1 in the
outbreak in Puentezino, Concepcion
----------------------

This is reported in the bulletin released by the office of the
Director General of Health of the MSPyBS [Ministerio de Salud Publica
y Bienestar Social]. Health Authorities urge the population, despite
the probability of rainfall being low during the current week, to not
cease their work in identification and elimination or inactivation of
potential breeding sites of _Aedes aegypti_, to reduce the
proliferation of the [dengue virus] vector and the risk of virus
transmission. To date, there is a total of 52 confirmed cases of the
disease in our country.

According to reports from Health Surveillance, in the past week 50
reports of suspected dengue cases were entered in the [reporting]
system. As for confirmation, the total is 52 (including one case from
Mexico), in the period corresponding to EW [epidemiological weeks] 41
- 46; this is because in the current week 24 new cases have been
confirmed, all coming from La Suerte and San Clemente neighborhoods of
the Sgto. Jose Felix Lopez (Puentezino) locality, Concepcion, the
place where the outbreak is currently registered.

According to results released by the Central Public Health Laboratory,
the [dengue virus] serotype currently circulating in this area is
DEN-1, which is different from the serotype recorded for the outbreak
in Yvy Yau and Horqueta, in Concepcion, at the end of 2008 and the
beginning of 2009, which was identified as DEN-3.

Within the framework of these events, from 9-13 November [2009] the
SENEPA visited the area with dengue cases in Puentezino, with the aim
of assessing the situation of the outbreak reported there. They
carried out an active search for fever [cases] according to the
epidemiological data cards for dengue and found that new febrile cases
were present, and so they proceeded to take [blood] samples for the
diagnostic laboratory.

Also, they observed breeding sites that were positive for _Aedes
aegypti_, among them various tanks for water storage that could not be
emptied; they were treated with larvicides, and recommendations were
given for their proper use. They carried out chemical [insecticide]
control with heavy and light-weight machines, with advance
verification of the concentration of insecticides used for barriers
and calibration of the heavy machines.

The also carried out an entomological evaluation with the "La Suerte"
company, in which they investigated 100 houses, with an infestation
rate of 13 percent. They reported that after cleaning up [trash] with
students and local SENEPA personnel, they achieved a reduction in the
household infestation indexes to 1 percent. During the clean-up 220
used tires and 3 tons of trash were eliminated.

The risk of a dengue epidemic increases in Cacoal
-------------------------------------------------
The menace of an epidemic [of dengue] is imminent, since now the
registered [number] of cases of the disease increases every day.
Dengue became a further cause for concern in Cacoal.

Over the years cases have continued to rise, and there have already
been more than 1000 cases. In the last month the increase has been
alarming, with more than 70 new cases each week. As was reported in
the press a little over 2 weeks ago, the Riozinho district, 10 km [6
mi] from Cacoal is one of the sites with more disease. However, in the
suburbs the situation also is considered critical.

In addition to the water tanks not buried, after sanitation work,
with the intensification of rains, water containers and domestic waste
returned as a concern. There, clean, stagnant water [is the breeding
site of] the mosquito that transmits the disease [virus], _Aedes
aegypti_, which finds an environment that is conducive to its
proliferation.

The neighborhoods with the greatest number of cases are those without
basic sanitation work; currently most of the water tanks are not
buried. In the entire municipality, there are 28 [health] agents
working on orientation and notification ... notifying residents that
they have 72 hours to clean up their yards. But usually this does not
happen, because the agents do not impose penalties provided by law.
According to one agent, it is very difficult to fight the disease only
with guidance and the penalties would be a more effective way to
prevent an increase in the number of cases of the disease.

According to information provided by a City Hall spokesperson, the
municipal health organization also conducts joint efforts of cleaning
yards and flower beds of the central city. The department emphasizes
routine visits, for services in health education, advising residents
house to house. "We have made 119 000 visits." he said.
