Re: Avian influenza (33): UK (England) H5 susp., RFI
----------------------------------------------------
Through programmes of active surveillance for notifiable avian
influenza in domestic poultry we occasionally detect 'apparent'
serological reactors (in accordance with the use of standard
international methods) in a small number of birds in some flocks of
domestic waterfowl. On a precautionary basis further immediate
investigations are conducted in these flocks (which are temporarily
placed under restriction until results are available) based upon
clinical examination and sampling for virological testing (including
by real-time RT-PCR) to rule out active infection.

Investigations in the cited case have been completed with negative
results and restrictions on this farm have been lifted.

The active surveillance is part of an EU wide mandatory programme in
domestic poultry for reportable AI.

[We are most grateful to Dr Brown for the above 1st-hand and self
explanatory clarification of the matter. Clearly the UK remains
currently free of avian influenza.
