A person has died and several others have been admitted to hospital
over what is suspected to be anthrax in Trans Mara District. There
was congestion at the district hospital as more than 40 people
reported to have eaten the infected meat were brought in for treatment.

An ambulance from the hospital and taxis had a difficult time
accessing the remote area where the incident occurred. With no other
means of transport for the victims, the ambulance made several trips
to the area.

District public health officer Anthony Mwanthi said a person had
died, 3 had been admitted to hospital, while 39 others with mild
symptoms were treated and discharged.

Mr Mwanthi said the affected area was prone to anthrax outbreaks,
noting that in October 2009, one person died and 33 others were
admitted to hospital after eating the carcass of an infected animal.

The health officer said that despite efforts to curb anthrax
outbreaks, the residents were still ignoring the dangers of eating
un-inspected meat. He cautioned the residents against relying on
herbs, which they believe to have the power to sterilise meat, and
instead engage the services of the public health officers to inspect
the meat. "It's time the locals changed their attitudes towards some
cultural beliefs, especially those which expose them to dangers," he said.

However, according to one of the residents, Mr Peter Sankale, it was
hard for many locals to dispose of carcasses by burning or burying
them, as this is a cultural taboo.

There are fears that more infections might occur as hundreds of
animals continue to be slaughtered for the end of year festivities
without being inspected.

[In the past 4 years, livestock anthrax has been reported in the
following Kenyan provinces: Central, Coast, Eastern, Nairobi, and the
Rift Valley. These have been mainly in cattle but also in sheep and
goats. The higher numbers in the Nairobi area probably reflect a
reporting bias and proximity to better diagnostic facilities. The
human loses are significant, with 136 cases in 2005-2008. There is an
unfortunate high probability that infected meat is sold in local
markets. Depending on herbs to quell the infection only increases the
probability of death. - Mod.MHJ]

[Anthrax spores survive for years in the environment, but the
herbivores are particularly susceptible to being exposed to the
spores, especially when grazing close to the ground during the dry
season. Human beings may develop cutaneous anthrax through a skin
lesion, gastrointestinal anthrax following ingestion of meat from an
animal that died of the disease, or pulmonary (inhalation) anthrax
from breathing in airborne anthrax spores. The public should be
educated in avoiding meat from diseased or dead animals and on the
burying of carcasses to prevent outbreaks. Special messages should be
designed to counter dangerous taboos so as to prevent recurrence of
the outbreaks.
