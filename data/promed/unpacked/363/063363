More than 3000 cattle in Lupane were vaccinated against anthrax
following the recent outbreak of the disease, it has been learned.

In an interview on Friday [14 Nov 2008], a Matabeleland North
Provincial Civil Protection Unit official said 147 cattle and not 200
had died following the outbreak. She clarified that, contrary to
earlier reports, only 2 people, not 6, had died of anthrax since the
outbreak of the deadly disease, which affects both livestock and
humans. The official said the province's Civil Protection Unit had
activated its systems on the ground to contain the outbreak. She said
so far 3075 cattle had been vaccinated.

The Civil Protection Unit is conducting health education campaigns in
the affected area, advising people not to eat meat of animals that
die as a result of anthrax as well as urging those infected to seek
treatment early. "Mobile clinics have been activated, and we are also
mounting roadblocks to prevent movement of meat or livestock from the
affected area," she said. The official said the affected area was
under quarantine.

Last week, the Principal Director for Veterinary Services, Dr Stuart
Hargreaves, said outbreaks of anthrax were common in some parts of
Matabeleland North, including where the disease was detected more
than 2 weeks ago. He said his department had the capacity to deal
with the outbreak, as it had adequate vaccines, and urged villagers
to report to veterinary officials any signs of the disease. Some
butcheries in parts of Lupane were reported to have suspended
operations following the outbreak.

The villagers said it was unfortunate that the district was battling
with the outbreak at a time when the government, through the Reserve
Bank of Zimbabwe, had embarked on a massive programme to rebuild the
national herd.

The restocking exercise has mainly focused on the Matabeleland
region, which is very suitable for cattle ranching.

resolved in Zimbabwe, we can, unfortunately, expect to see more of
such events. In more stable times, this disease, whether in livestock
or humans, was an uncommon event in the country. - Mod.MHJ]
