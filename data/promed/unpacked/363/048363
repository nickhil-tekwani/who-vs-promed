At 11:00 on 16 Nov 2018, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs received a report from the China Center for Animal Disease Control and Prevention, that a wild boar from Hanjiang district of Baishan city, Jilin province, had been tested and found positive for virus nucleic acid of African swine fever [ASF]. The diagnosis was made by the China Center for Animal Health and Epidemiology (National Center for Animal Disease Research).

After the outbreak, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs and the State Forestry Bureau immediately dispatched a supervision team to the local area to carry out an epidemiological investigation. The local authorities have started to apply the emergency response mechanism according to the requirements, and carried out harmless treatment and disinfection measures for sick and dead wild pigs, strengthened inspections of local wild boars, strictly restricting the stocking of nearby pigs, and inspected the areas with wild boar activity that surround pig farms. At present, the measures above have been implemented.

[From the machine-translated text above it is not clear if the tested wild boar was found dead or was shot/sampled. The date of its collection/sampling is not available, and would be useful for the assessment of the situation. It may be assumed that once ASF has penetrated the wild boar population, its further spread will become even more complex than hitherto; a cause for grave concern, nationally and beyond.

In China, wild boar density is estimated at between 2 and 5 head/sq.km, with densities put at 2.24 head/sq.km [5.8 head/sq.mi] in some forests in north eastern China, and even higher in the south eastern coastal areas. In Guangdong Province Nature Reserve, wild boar density was estimated at between 4.87 and 5.15 head/sq.km. [12.6-13.4 head/sq.mi] (ref 1, page 8). This is a rather high density; for comparison's sake, see data from Europe in ref 2 (page 13, Fig. 13 "Wild boar population abundance (head per sq.km) based on available population estimates".

The species is widely distributed throughout China, except for some dry and unsuitable regions in the west (Xinjiang province) and north of the country, including the Tibetan plateau, and the region bordering Mongolia. However, little precise information is available about the ecology, population structure and dynamics, as well as the actual distribution and density, of wild boar in China. Complementary information is required.
