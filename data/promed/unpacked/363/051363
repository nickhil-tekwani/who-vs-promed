Equestrians should note the outbreak of equine flu that has recently been
reported on is in fact a new strain which is now confined to the Underberg
region.
The show-jumping and eventing shows that were scheduled for the area have
been allocated a date later in the year in order for the area to be
designated risk-free. There is little doubt that the outbreak was a local
one and that it has been contained in that area.
This will not affect the Royal Show, as Pietermaritzburg equestrians are
well aware of what has been happening in the Underburg area for the last 6
weeks and have taken all the necessary precautions.
There was a small outbreak in the Dargle area, where it is reported that
10 horses had succumbed to the infection, but a scheduled Pony Club camp
was canceled by the organizers.
This sensible action undoubtedly stopped any danger of spreading the equine
flu -- and those people should be congratulated for their foresight.

[This article does not give us enough information to understand how the
strain differs. Are the signs more or less severe? Does this strain of
influenza produces higher fevers, or is there a specific treatment?
Although the outbreak seems confined locally, the article opens by
indicating that other equine owners should know what is going on. This in
itself raises suspicions that there is more here than meets the eye. If
someone has knowledge of this strain and the specifics regarding it,
ProMED-mail would appreciate an update. - Mod.TG]
