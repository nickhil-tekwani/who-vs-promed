Typhoid kills 4; 540 others in hospital
---------------------------------------
4 people have died and 540 others have been admitted to hospital following
an outbreak of typhoid fever in north western Rwanda, Desire Ndushabandi,
the health ministry's secretary-general, told IRIN on Thu, 1 Jul 2004. "We
have embarked on an intensive campaign to sensitise the population on the
need to improve their sanitation," he said.
Ndushabandi said the outbreak, which began 2 weeks ago, was due to poor
hygiene practices, especially drinking untreated water. The north western
province of Ruhengeri, which has an estimated population of 900 000, is the
most affected. Ndushabandi said the first cases of typhoid were reported in
the district of Kinigi, which borders the volcanic Virunga Mountains. The
disease then spread to most other parts of the densely populated Ruhengeri
Province.
"We have purchased the necessary drugs and are trying to promote awareness
to prevent further spread," he said. He also said his ministry was carrying
out epidemiological surveillance, and was holding meetings with local
leaders and the public in an effort to curb the spread of the disease.
