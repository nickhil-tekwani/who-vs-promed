USA: risk of resurgence of measles
----------------------------------
As the United Kingdom braces for an impending measles outbreak this winter
due to low vaccination rates, United States health experts say this raises
concerns the disease could spread to the US, particularly as immunization
rates in some states have fallen to dangerously low levels. The drop in
measles vaccinations also heightens fears of outbreaks of 2 other diseases:
rubella and mumps. This is because the measles vaccine generally is
administered in conjunction with mumps and rubella vaccines in a single
shot known as MMR. So a drop in measles protection is a drop in rubella and
mumps protection as well.
Of the 3 diseases, measles carries the most concern because it is a highly
contagious disease with a death rate of one or 2 children for every 1000
infected. It also can cause other serious complications, including
pneumonia, swelling of the brain, and seizures. The major rubella worry is
that if it infects women when they are pregnant, it can cause birth defects
in their developing fetus -- including deafness, eye defects, heart
abnormalities, and mental retardation.
"A resurgence in measles in the United Kingdom could translate to exposure
here," said Dr Walter Orenstein, director of the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention's (CDC's) National Immunization Program in Atlanta.
He noted the concern is compounded by the fact that: "The chief source of
measles in the United States used to be the (United Kingdom)."
In addition to the expected UK measles rise, health officials also are
worried about the ongoing outbreak in the Marshall Islands and recent
epidemics in Asia and Italy. In an effort to reduce the threat posed to the
US, CDC officials are collaborating with international authorities to keep
measles in check in other countries as well as making efforts to keep
vaccination rates high domestically. Dr Diane Griffin, chair of the
Department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology at Johns Hopkins
University's Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore, agreed the
outbreaks in other areas of the world pose a risk to the US.
"There is continued importation of measles from all these different parts
of the world," including Japan and Europe, Griffin told UPI. "This means
there are more cases that are likely to be imported ... and our
immunization will continue to be tested."
This prospect concerns health officials because vaccination rates in some
states and cities have dropped to levels that would allow an outbreak of
measles to be sustained if a case gets into the community. This could have
severe consequences as evidenced by measles outbreaks in the US between
1989 and 1991, mainly among unvaccinated, preschool-aged children that
infected more than 55 000 people and resulted in 123 deaths.
MMR vaccination rates in the UK have dropped to the lowest level in at
least 8 years, primarily due to unfounded concerns by parents that the
vaccine is linked to autism. The lowered immunization rates already appear
to be leading to increases of mumps, rubella, and measles. In Scottish
children under age 15, suspected cases of measles have jumped by 18 per
cent in the last 18 months -- and rubella by 22 per cent and mumps by 27
per cent -- according to statistics released earlier this week by the
National Health Service. Most of these cases will turn out to be due to
other causes but the trend does suggest the diseases are on the increase.
The current rate of MMR vaccine coverage in the United Kingdom stands at
about 86 per cent, and in some areas the coverage rate has dropped as low
as 61 per cent. Health officials think a vaccine coverage rate of about 95
per cent is necessary to prevent outbreaks and anything below 90 per cent
could allow outbreaks to flourish. In the US, MMR vaccine coverage is about
91.6 per cent, but "we hear anecdotal reports of lower coverage in certain
areas," CDC's Orenstein said. Several areas have rates of only 87 per cent
or lower, including Arizona (except for Maricopa County), Montana,
Oklahoma, Oregon, Shelby County Tennessee, Houston Texas, and parts of
Colorado. Some states have vaccination rates below the 90 per cent mark,
including Alaska, most of California, Idaho, Kentucky, Louisiana, Nevada,
Washington, and Wyoming. The numbers are averages for these whole states,
so there could be pockets where the coverage rates are much lower,
Orenstein said. Even if some local populations have only 50 per cent
immunization coverage, they could be overlooked within an average of 91 per
cent for the whole state, he explained.
Keeping the immunization coverage uniformly high is essential because an
increasing number of unvaccinated people makes it easier for a case of
measles to take hold and, in turn, boost the likelihood of spreading the
disease to vaccinated individuals -- because no vaccine confers 100 percent
protection.
"The real threat is the same thing that has driven down immunization rates
in the United Kingdom and Japan, and that is parental resistance to having
their children immunized," Griffin said. In Colorado, for example, there
are communities "where close to 20 percent of kids are not immunized," she
said.
"All you need is the introduction of a case and, since it's constantly
happening in the US, all you need is a case to occur in those vulnerable
communities" for an epidemic to take hold, she said. To make matters worse,
"there is concern among the public health community that parental
resistance to vaccination is increasing" in the US, Griffin said.
In the Marshall Islands measles outbreak that began this summer and has
resulted in 752 cases and 3 deaths, the vaccination coverage was about 75
per cent. This is of concern because people infected in that outbreak are
known to have traveled into the United States, Dr Martin Myers, executive
director of the National Network for Immunization Information in
Alexandria, Virginia, told UPI. Mexico also recently had measles cases
imported from Asia, and this could easily spread across the border into the
United States, he added. "The potential for introduction into the United
States is substantial," Myers said.
