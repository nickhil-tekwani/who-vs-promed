Public health officials in Sweden have noted an increase in the number of people falling ill with _Campylobacter_ infections this month [August 2020]. The rise coincides with an increase in _Campylobacter_ in broiler flocks since the end of July [2020], according to Folkhalsomyndigheten (Public Health Agency of Sweden). This agency, regional infection control units, National Veterinary Institute (SVA), Livsmedelsverket (National Food Agency), Swedish Board of Agriculture, and Swedish Work Environment Authority are investigating causes of the increase and trying to reduce the number of cases.

During the 4 weeks before the increase, the numbers of reported cases with domestic infections or where information about country of infection was missing were 88 cases in week 28 in early July [2020], 77 in week 29, 88 in week 30, and 94 in week 31. In week 32 at the start of August [2020], infections increased to 149 and they reached 161 in week 33.

The rise has affected different parts of the country, but one county, Sormland, found 12 cases in July [2020] and already there have been 19 in August.

Rikard Dryselius, a microbiologist at Folkhalsomyndigheten, said the general increase is seen in most counties across Sweden, especially in those with a large enough population base. "We do not know yet whether it is an outbreak or not. The information we have is a sudden increase in the number of human cases that, according to the Swedish National Veterinary Institute, follows a sudden increase among large broiler flocks. Typing is underway and comparisons will be performed," he told Food Safety News.

The SVA reports information weekly on the proportion of _Campylobacter_-positive flocks. This shows an increase for weeks 29, 30 and 31.

_Campylobacter_ infection is more common in the summer, but the increase comes after a period when the incidence has been unusually low. The prevalence of _Campylobacter_ in broiler flocks has been very low during the first half of 2020.

"The COVID-19 pandemic is one plausible explanation for the low numbers, as similar patterns have also been observed for other diseases, which we intend to investigate further. An additional explanation could also be the low level of _Campylobacter_-positive broiler flocks, as you can see in the statistics of SVA," said Dryselius.

For the past 3 years, Folkhalsomyndigheten and Livsmedelsverket have compared _Campylobacter_ from fresh chicken bought in stores during the summer with _Campylobacter_ from human cases during the corresponding period. This work found about one-third of cases could be linked to chicken meat and the majority to Swedish conventionally bred chicken. Evidence so far suggests the increase in infections and higher occurrence in broiler flocks is also on this occasion connected, according to Folkhalsomyndigheten.

Folkhalsomyndigheten and the National Veterinary Institute will analyze _Campylobacter_ samples from patients and broiler flocks as part of the investigation. A total of 8132 cases of campylobacteriosis were reported in 2018 compared with 10 608 in 2017. Most are considered sporadic, but in the past few years, several large outbreaks linked to domestically produced chicken have occurred. In 2016 and 2017, the country had a large outbreak caused by Swedish chicken with an estimated 5000 more cases reported between August 2016 and May 2017 than normal.

People with infection usually have diarrhea that is often bloody, fever, and stomach cramps. Nausea and vomiting may occur. Symptoms usually start 2 to 5 days after the person ingests _Campylobacter_ and last about one week.
