On [Tue 23 Oct 2018], the Central African Minister of Health and Population, Pierre Some, formally recognized the existence in the Central African Republic city of Bocaranga ([Ouham-Pende prefecture] in the extreme north west) of a case of yellow fever, whose signs were discovered in a woman aged 80 and confirmed by the Pasteur Institute of Bangui.

As a result, Mr Somse announced the strengthening of epidemiological surveillance in the locality and response measures that have benefited from the support of the World Health Organization (WHO), the Pasteur Institute of Bangui, and the NGO CORDAID [Catholic Organization for Relief and Development Aid].

These measures, he added, include immunization, patient care, and community outreach to improve hygiene and sanitation.

Mr Somse urged residents of so-called risk areas or forest areas to sleep under impregnated mosquito nets. He also advised people in these areas to immediately refer all people with yellow fever indications to health centers.

He described yellow fever as responsible for a mortality rate of between 25 and 50 percent of proven cases, manifested by jaundice caused by a virus. The disease, which is transmitted to humans through mosquitoes, he added, has a reservoir in primates, like monkeys.

[The situation of yellow fever (YF) remains worrying in Africa, particularly in Central Africa. Yet, there is an effective vaccine, available, and well tolerated; a single dose of the vaccine protects against the disease for life.

Yellow fever is an acute viral haemorrhagic disease transmitted by infected mosquitoes. The term "yellow" refers to jaundice presented by some patients.

A big epidemic of YF had broken out in the DRC in June 2016. This epidemic was the subject of much ink: it was declared over in February 2017, after more than 6 months without new cases; it occurred following cases of YF in Angola; there was a shortage of vaccines; the usual dose had been divided to cover needs.

In the face of this epidemic in CAR, an epidemiological survey must be carried out, an anti-vector control must be undertaken, as well as a response vaccination. - Mod.BM

It would be of interest to know which mosquito vector species were involved in YF virus transmission in this small outbreak. If mosquito species that transmit YF virus in urban/suburban settings are present there is a risk of ongoing transmission and a significant outbreak. - Mod.TY
