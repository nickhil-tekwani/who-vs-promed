Health agents combat the malaria mosquito in Madalena
--------------------------------------------------
Following the confirmation of a case of malaria in the municipality of
Santa Maria Madalena, approximately 240 km. from Rio de Janeiro, in the
north central part of the state [of Rio de Janeiro], the Health Secretaries
of the State and Municipal levels began a campaign to find new positive
foci of the disease in the rural portion of the municipality.
In 2003 alone there have been 12 persons who developed malaria, which is
transmitted by the Anopheles mosquito. According to the chief of the
malaria control program of the state, the epidemiologist Jose Carlos
Rodrigues Paz, 11 cases were imported; only a summer visitor, a 58-year-old
retiree contracted the disease in Santa Maria Madalena and is doing well.
The goal of the health agents is to collect blood specimens from all of the
approximately 1000 in-habitants of the locality Terras Frias, 8 km from the
center [of Santa Maria Madalena], where the [above mentioned locally
acquired] case has a farm. The locality is surrounded by Mata Atlantica [a
forested area] and the summer visitor had the habit of spending several
days a week in the site and going for walks in the forest.
The health agents will also collect blood specimens from neighbors living
close to the retiree in the neighborhood called Arranchadoura, in the urban
zone of Santa Maria Madalena, looking for positive vectors of Anopheles in
the municipality. Daily between 17:00 and 22:00, health agents will enter
the woods in Terra Frias in order to do mosquito capture.
According to Jose Carlos Rodrigues Paz, malaria is present in all of the
Southeast of Brazil, with incidence in all of the State of Rio de Janeiro.
"The pleasant climate in the region of Madalena facilitates the action of
the mosquito. In this season when people come for vacation is the period
of greatest incidence of malaria. Generally there are 60 cases reported in
the state of Rio each year, but in 2002, there were 109 cases
reported". Of these 109 cases, 5 were contracted in the interior [of the
state] and the others were imported. One of the cases contracted in the
state was in Madalena.

[Secondary cases of imported malaria are always a concern in areas with the
Anopheles vector and a suitable climate. The danger for a larger outbreak
is probably limited, as the population is not immune, and it is therefore
not very likely that there could be asymptomatic carriers. - Mod.EP]
