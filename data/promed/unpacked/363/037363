LEGIONNAIRE'S DISEASE EPIDEMIOLOGY (7)
======================================
Robert Wallis is right when he points out that the first stage in
identifying nosocomial legionellosis is correctly identifying the
infection. In addition to the tests he mentioned, a urinary
antigen test is also useful in the acute phase of infection. The
incubation period for legionnaires' disease (LD) is generally 2-10
days. Unless the patient was hospitalised during all the 10 days
prior to onset of symptoms compatible with LD, then it is not
possible to say with certainty that the infection was acquired in
hospital - although the suspicion may be raised. Further
epidemiological evidence would be needed in this situation - ideally a
clinical and an environmental isolate for comparison.
