A total of 16 children have been diagnosed with the bacterial infection, and concerns have been raised that tourists may spread it further, RUV [the Icelandic National Broadcasting Service] reports. The outbreak is purported to have originated in Efstadal 2, a farm and restaurant near Laugarvatn, after a group of schoolchildren visited the place, with some of them contracting _Escherichia coli_ infection. To be clear: none of the food nor any of the employees tested positive for _E. coli_. Rather, it is all but certain the bacteria originated from the fecal matter of calves on the farm.

Health authorities have pointed out that there are many rural restaurants in Iceland that are located near farms, prompting a more thorough investigation into stopping the infection's spread. Further, these locations are visited by many tourists, which could potentially increase the risk of spreading _E. coli_. As it stands now, Efstadal 2 is [said to be] safe to visit; the cow sties have been quarantined and the restaurant is clean.
