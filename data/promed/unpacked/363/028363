This was posted in SCIENCE-WEEK a service that distributes synopses of
articles from newspapers, magazines, as well as journals such as SCIENCE
and NATURE. The Democratic Republic of Congo is of course the former
country of Zaire, diferrentiated from Republic of the Congo, the DRC's
neighbor to the west.
ALARM OVER AN OUTBREAK OF HUMAN MONKEYPOX DISEASE
The largest and most complex animal viruses are the poxviruses, among them
smallpox and a related virus called monkeypox. Smallpox was ostensibly
eradicated completely in 1979. Monkeypox, however, is far from eradicated.
Until recently the disease exhibited minor outbreaks, with the incidence
being quickly damped due to the apparent difficulty of human to human
transmission. In these outbreaks, the disease was evidently transmitted by
eating the meat of infected monkeys, squirrels, and rats. Now, however,
during the last year, there has been a striking outbreak of 92 cases of
monkeypox, all within a few villages in the central part of the Democratic
Republic of Congo, and the most troubling aspect is the evidence that the
rate of human to human transmission may have suddenly increased many-fold
over what it has been in the past.
Peter Jahrling, a virologist at the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute
(MD US) says, "I hate to be accused of pushing the alarmist button, but for
practical purposes smallpox is back." And Ali Khan, a medical
epidemiologist at the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention, who
recently visited the area of the Congo in question, says, "I am personally
concerned about what would happen if this disease showed up in a major city."
However, an argument can be made that the natural immunity of the people of
the Congo has been compromised by a high incidence of HIV and the
vicissitudes of armed conflict in the area. (Science 18 July)

I wish to differ from the position which is traditionally expressed by the
WHO experts concerning the monkeypox threat to humans. I am not at all sure
that the monkeypox virus will never change its adaptation to humans and
become a source of real outbreaks among us. Already in the last episode in
Zaire there were reports of human to human spread. There is agreement that
in the past when people were vaccinated against smallpox they were also
protected against monkeypox. I do not understand why if we have a
protective vaccine against monkeypox we should not use it at least in areas
where the disease exists, like in Zaire. Can anyone explain this to me?
