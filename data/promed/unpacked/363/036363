A Swedish woman is being treated at the intensive care unit of
Linkoping University Hospital in eastern Sweden after being diagnosed
with the deadly disease Lassa fever. The woman was infected in West
Africa, where she had been working for a humanitarian aid
organization. She is the 1st patient ever to be treated for Lassa
fever in Sweden.

The woman's condition is stable, but she will remain isolated for
another few weeks, according to infectious disease specialist Britt
Akerlind. The woman, who is in her 30s, was flown home on a medical
transport flight and arrived in Sweden on Monday [7 Mar 2011] morning.
"She tested positive for the disease in Africa. We have since
conducted some tests here, but the results are not in yet. We are
treating this as a serious illness," Akerlind told news agency TT.

The symptoms of Lassa fever, which infects between 300 000 and 500
000 people annually, include a high temperature and internal
haemorrhaging, but the majority of those that contract the disease
make a full recovery. "Only about one per cent of those infected
become seriously ill, and it is impossible to know in advance who will
be affected worse than others," Akerlind told TT.

Rodents are often carriers of Lassa fever, and the disease is spread
through contact with their faeces. Between humans, the disease is
passed through the exchange of bodily fluids. How the Swedish woman
caught the disease is unknown.

According to Akerlind there is no risk that Lassa fever, which claims
around 5000 lives annually, will spread in Sweden.

"There is no threat to the public whatsoever," she told TT.

[Importation of Lassa fever from West Africa into Europe and the
United States has occurred occasionally in the past. In this case, the
infection was diagnosed in West Africa (country not stated) and the
patient transferred to Linkoping University Hospital in eastern Sweden
for treatment. Linkoping is a city in southern Sweden, and the capital
of Ãstergotland County. Its location is shown in the map at:
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link%C3%B6ping>.

Lassa haemorrhagic fever is an acute illness of 1-4 weeks duration
that occurs throughout West Africa. Though 1st described in the 1950s,
the virus causing the disease was not identified until 1969. The virus
is a single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the virus family
_Arenaviridae_. Lassa fever is known to be endemic in Guinea, Liberia,
Sierra Leone and parts of Nigeria but probably exists in other West
African countries as well. About 80 per cent of human infections are
asymptomatic; the remaining cases have severe multisystem disease,
where the virus affects several organs in the body, such as the liver,
spleen, and kidneys. The incubation period of Lassa fever ranges from
6-21 days.

Lassa fever is a zoonotic disease. The animal reservoir of Lassa
virus is a rodent of the genus _Mastomys_, commonly known as the
"multimammate rat." _Mastomys_ infected with Lassa virus do not become
ill, but they can shed the virus in their urine and faeces. (An image
of a multimammate rat can be viewed at
<http://www15.bni-hamburg.de/bni/bni2/neu2/getfile.acgi?area=forschunggruppen&pid=21232>).

Lassa fever can affect all age groups. Persons at greatest risk are
those living in rural areas where _Mastomys_ are usually found,
especially in areas of poor sanitation or crowded living conditions.
There is no epidemiological evidence supporting airborne spread
between humans, but person-to-person transmission occurs in both
community and health care settings. - Mod.CP]
