[Korosten, Zhytomyr province, is on the northern border of Ukraine; see http://www.fallingrain.com/world/UP/27/Korosten.html. This is as far as one could get from Odessa. Clinically it is a case of cutaneous anthrax. As her husband is not affected, I think we can presume that this infection originated from some contaminated meat given to the woman or bought in a street market from a butchered sick cow. We must await confirmation.

The OIE report of the bovine case in Odessa is a formal veterinary recognition of the 5 cases reported earlier, who had butchered this animal and developed cutaneous anthrax. The Falling Rain location shows the affected area around Sarata, a long narrow north-south valley in the middle of nowhere: see http://www.fallingrain.com/world/UP/17/Sarata.html. - Mod.MHJ
