[The following additional information has been provided by Irene Lai in
addition to that reported in this ProMED-mail post. - Mod.CP]

1. Regarding the influenza virus strain detected in the fatal cases: The
updates from the Hong Kong Center for Health Protection indicate that the 7
year old boy had H1N1 virus, whereas the 3 year old girl had H3N2 virus
<http://www.chp.gov.hk/files/pdf/Flu_daily%20update_14_3_08_final_en.pdf>.

2. Gene sequencing results available today on the 7 year old boy who died
in TMH [Tuen Mun Hospital] confirmed that the H1N1 virus in the boy has the
same genetic makeup as the circulating H1N1 (Brisbane) strains in Hong Kong.

Earlier, gene sequencing results on the 3 year old girl who died in TMH
found that H3N2 virus in the girl has same genetic composition as the
circulating H3N2 (Brisbane) strains as well. Both strains have been
circulating in different parts of the world during the past few months.
These results confirm that the 2 children did not die from a new virus that
is more virulent than the circulating strains in the region.

[The information provided by Irene Lai supplements that previously
available and confirms that the outbreak of influenza, responsible for the
closure of schools and the deaths of 2 children, is caused by H1N1 and H3N2
strains of influenza A virus circulating widely in in Asia and elsewhere at
the present time. - Mod.CP]

[2] Some questions

re: Seasonal influenza, child - China (HK SAR) 20080315.1027
------------------------------------------------------------
[Dr Allen Lenoir has posed the following questions. Answers or additional
comments would be welcomed. - Mod.CP]

The statement that H1N1 and H3N2 viruses were found in the victim would
indicate viral isolation and coinfection rather than seropositivity, if
taken literally. Of course, the media may have misunderstood. Can we have a
clarification on this issue?

If it was coinfection, do we know whether or not the victim had been
treated with a neuraminidase inhibitor? A recent report from Harvard has
indicated that neuraminidase inhibitors can increase the possibility of
dual influenza infection.

If the reporter actually meant seropositivity, was the victim ever vaccinated?
