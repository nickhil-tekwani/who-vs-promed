The last patient here diagnosed with the Middle East respiratory syndrome was readmitted to the hospital and tested positive for the virus again after showing symptoms such as high fever, the Health and Welfare Ministry said Mon [12 Oct 2015].

The 35-year-old patient, who contracted the virus while suffering from lymphoma, had left the hospital earlier this month [Oct 2015] after testing negative.

A total of 129 people who came in contact with the patient, including the medical staff and family members, have also been put into isolation.

Authorities had initially planned to announce the end of MERS for the country on 29 Oct 2015.

Since Korea's 1st MERS case on 20 May 2015, the disease has infected 186 people, killing 36 of them.

[On 28 Jul 2015, South Korea's Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn declared a "de facto end" to the MERS outbreak, although WHO did not. Officials were planning to formally announce the end of MERS for the country on 29 Oct 2015. As of 12-13 Aug 2015 in Korea, there were: 186 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection, including 36 deaths, 140 recoveries, and 10 currently active cases, including 3 in critical condition [see ProMED mail MERS-CoV (107): Saudi Arabia, South Korea, WHO 20150813.3575351]. This case relapse is a setback for the country. - Mod.LK]

A total of 61 people have been isolated after South Korea's last Middle East respiratory syndrome patient, who had been recovering from the disease after being released 3 Oct [2015], was rehospitalized Sun [11 Oct 2015] and tested positive again for the virus, according to the Health Ministry.

The quarantined individuals include the patient's family members, hospital inpatients and their guardians and medical professionals. However, the chance of them being infected by the virus from the particular patient is "very low," according to medical professionals and the government.

"It seems like a very small amount of the virus particles that had been incubating inside the patient's body has been detected," said Dr. Kim Ik-joong from the Seoul National University Hospital.

The patient was South Korea's 80th confirmed MERS case, and the last to recover and be released from the hospital. The patient, who has also been suffering from cancer, was initially exposed to the virus while staying at the Samsung Medical Center in May [2015]. He was confirmed as a MERS patient on 7 Jun [2015], and received treatment at a quarantine facility until his release on 3 Oct 2015. Before his release, he tested negative for the virus 2 consecutive times.
