FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
1 Nov 2002
Positive CWD Case Found in Illinois
Chronic wasting disease (CWD) has been detected in a sample from a wild
deer near Roscoe in Winnebago County, the Department of Natural Resources
(DNR) announced today. CWD is not known to be contagious to livestock or
humans.
The young female deer was shot by a landowner in late October because he
believed it was ill. DNR Conservation Police officers were contacted and
collected the doe for testing at the Illinois Department of Agriculture
laboratory in Centralia. A follow-up test conducted today at the National
Veterinary Services Laboratory in Ames, Iowa, confirmed the diagnosis.
"This is the first positive for CWD from any deer or elk in Illinois,
though we've been monitoring and testing for the disease for the past 5
years," said IDNR Director Brent Manning. "Illinois expanded its
surveillance efforts earlier this year and created a joint task force with
the Departments of Natural Resources and Agriculture following the CWD
outbreak in southern Wisconsin."
"The detection of CWD in Winnebago County is disappointing," Manning said.
"We are committed to a long-term plan of stepped up surveillance and
monitoring and to taking all steps biologically appropriate to control the
spread of chronic wasting disease in Illinois. Deer hunters and those who
value the health of wildlife and outdoor recreation in Illinois will
continue to play an important role in that process."
Extensive testing for the disease is planned during Illinois' firearm deer
season, which begins Friday, 22 Nov 2002. About 3500 samples in 36 counties
from hunter-harvested deer around Illinois will be collected and tested.
Larger numbers of samples from hunter-harvested deer are being collected in
northern Illinois. Additional samples also are being taken from
deer-control programs in northeastern Illinois where firearm deer hunting
is not allowed.
Counties tentatively to be sampled for CWD during the 2002 firearm deer
hunting season include Jo Daviess, Stephenson, Winnebago, Boone, McHenry,
Carroll, Ogle, DeKalb, Whiteside, Rock Island, Bureau, LaSalle, Hancock,
Adams, Pike, Fulton, McLean, Vermilion, Sangamon, Macoupin, Shelby,
Fayette, Effingham, Clark, Lawrence, Madison, St. Clair, Clinton,
Washington, Randolph, Jefferson, Marion,Williamson, Union, Johnson and
Pope. Counties were selected based on a variety of factors including
geographic location, size of deer population, and the number of facilities
with captive deer or elk.
"Once we get test results back from our expanded surveillance efforts the
task force will be able to evaluate the extent of the disease in Illinois
and the necessary steps to control the disease," Manning said.
Chronic wasting disease is a fatal neurological disease found in deer and
elk. The disease affects the brains of infected animals, causing them to
become emaciated, display abnormal behavior, lose coordination and
eventually die. It is not known to be contagious to livestock or humans.
CWD has been diagnosed in wild, free-ranging deer and elk as well as in
captive animals in a number of western states but earlier this year was
found in neighboring Wisconsin and Minnesota. Illinois has been testing
suspect animals for the last 5 years, as well as taking samples during deer
hunting season.
A task force, comprised of key staff from both agencies, has been working
for months to develop plans to address surveillance of wild deer and
captive herds, import and export of deer and elk and a planned response to
a potential chronic wasting disease outbreak in Illinois.
The importation of hunter-harvested deer and elk is being limited, the
importation of live animals has been restricted and the feeding of wild
deer has been banned.
A DNR rule bans the importation of hunter-harvested deer and elk carcasses
into Illinois, except for deboned meat, antlers, antlers attached to skull
caps, hides, upper canine teeth, and finished taxidermist mounts. Skull
caps must be cleaned of all brain and muscle tissue. This action prevents
hunters from bringing potentially diseased animals into Illinois and
discarding their parts in a manner that could result in contamination of
Illinois' deer herd.
The Department has banned the feeding of wild deer and other wildlife in
areas where wild deer are present. The ban includes food, salt, mineral
blocks and other food products, with some exceptions. For example, bird and
squirrel feeders close to homes and incidental feeding of wildlife within
active livestock operations, are exempt from the ban. For a complete list
of the exemptions see the rule on the Department's web site.
The Department has also implemented regulations to minimize the threat of
chronic wasting disease entering Illinois through the interstate
transportation of captive deer and elk and to monitor captive herds already
in Illinois. DNR shares responsibility with the Department of Agriculture
in regulating captive deer and elk on game farms. DNR's new rule
complements new regulations being adopted by the Agriculture Department for
diseased animals.

but a success for the education of alerting hunters to notice signs of the
disease and to submit samples for testing. - Mod.TG]
