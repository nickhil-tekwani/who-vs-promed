West Nile Virus Detected in Canadian Birds
------------------------------------------
This weekend has seen the "arrival" of West Nile virus in Ontario, Canada.
On Friday afternoon, it was announced that a crow from the Windsor area had
tested positive by PCR for West Nile virus, while a positive assay on a
blue jay from the Oakville area [15 miles west of Toronto was reported
over the weekend.
Both bird specimens will undergo confirmatory testing (i.e., culture and
immunohistochemistry) at the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg.
