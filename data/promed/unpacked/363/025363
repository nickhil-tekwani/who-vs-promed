A health official in Nigeria on Thursday [19 Sep 2019] confirmed 6 cases of yellow fever in the northeast state of Gombe. Nuhu Vile, an epidemiologist with the state health authorities, told media the confirmed patients were treated and discharged.

Yellow fever cases have been reported in northeastern Nigeria, including the states of Bauchi and Borno, since 29 Aug [2019].

No death case has been recorded in the state, he said, noting that an investigation conducted by experts showed that the case originated from Yankari, neighboring Bauchi state.

The state government had set up a team to address the problem, the health expert said, while calling on the people to always report cases of fever to health facilities for quick examination and treatment.

According to [Vile], yellow fever was caused by [a virus transmitted by] mosquitoes and therefore urged people to sanitize their environment.

Vile advised parents to ensure they vaccinated their children from an early age during the routine immunization. He said once a child was immunized before he or she attained 9 months, chances of getting infected would be minimal.

Yellow fever is a viral hemorrhagic disease that causes bleeding, which may come out from any of the body openings. It is spread through the bite of infected _Aedes_ mosquitoes with symptoms such as fever with jaundice in the early stages and with multiple organ dysfunctions resulting in kidney and liver failure [in later stages].

[It is difficult to determine if all the Gombe cases originated in that state or if all cases were infected with yellow fever virus (YF) in Yankari, Bauchi state, then traveled to Gombe and became ill there. There was one confirmed and one suspected YF case acquired in the Yankari Game Reserve, Bauchi state [see Undiagnosed illness - Nigeria (02): (BO) fatal, poss. link to game reserve, RFI 20190906.6660123], indicating that YF virus was circulating in that state. In any event, it is prudent to increase monitoring in Gombe and to vaccinate children around age 9 months, even if they had been vaccinated previously (see report on vaccine boosters below). - Mod.TY

Summary

Background
A single dose of vaccine against yellow fever is routinely administered to infants aged 9-12 months under the Expanded Programme on Immunization, but the long-term outcome of vaccination in this age group is unknown. We aimed to evaluate the long-term persistence of neutralising antibodies to yellow fever virus following routine vaccination in infancy.

Methods
We did a longitudinal cohort study, using a microneutralisation assay to measure protective antibodies against yellow fever in Malian and Ghanaian children vaccinated around age 9 months and followed up for 4.5 years (Mali), or 2.3 and 6.0 years (Ghana). Healthy children with available day-0 sera, a complete follow-up history, and no record of yellow fever revaccination were included; children seropositive for yellow fever at baseline were excluded. We standardised antibody concentrations with reference to the yellow fever WHO International Standard.

Findings
We included 587 Malian and 436 Ghanaian children vaccinated between 5 Jun 2009 and 26 Dec 2012. In the Malian group, 296 (50.4%, 95% CI 46.4-54.5) were seropositive (antibody concentration greater than or equal to 0.5 IU/mL) 4.5 years after vaccination. Among the Ghanaian children, 121 (27.8%, CI 23.5-32.0) were seropositive after 2.3 years. These results show a large decrease from the proportions of seropositive infants 28 days after vaccination, 96.7% in Mali and 72.7% in Ghana, reported by a previous study of both study populations. The number of seropositive children increased to 188 (43.1%, 95% CI 38.5-47.8) in the Ghanaian group 6.0 years after vaccination, but this result might be confounded by unrecorded revaccination or natural infection with wild yellow fever virus during a 2011-12 outbreak in northern Ghana.

Interpretation
Rapid waning of immunity during the early years after vaccination of 9-month-old infants argues for a revision of the single-dose recommendation for this target population in endemic countries. The short duration of immunity in many vaccinees suggests that booster vaccination is necessary to meet the 80% population immunity threshold for prevention of yellow fever outbreaks.

[The open question is whether the children with no measurable neutralizing antibody are fully susceptible to YF virus infection, or if some residual immunity at undetectable levels still provides some protection. Since a challenge to test susceptibility is out of the question, the safest approach is to revaccinate children in that age cohort despite WHO advice that a single dose of the vaccine produces lifelong immunity. If a booster dose is administered, it would be interesting to see if this mounts an anamnestic antibody response that would indicate there are still quiescent resident B cells capable of a rapid antibody response. - Mod.TY]
