AVIAN INFLUENZA (137): GERMANY (BAVARIA), DUCK

In response to ProMED-mail "Avian influenza (136): Germany, Hungary,
Italy," we would like to clarify that it may be assumed that also the
sample from the 3rd duck from Southern Germany (Speichersee, near Munich)
contained highly pathogenic avian influenza virus.
Diagnosis and subsequent verification of HPAIV is based on a combination of
specific PCR tests. Whereas the H5 and N1 real-time RT PCRs were positive
for all 3 samples, another real-time RT PCR covering the sequences encoding
the HA cleavage site (Hoffmann et al, 2007) was positive for only 2. Since
the 3rd sample contained only low amounts [of] viral RNA, it is reasonable
to assume that the negative result of the less-sensitive cleavage-site PCR
reflects the detection limit of the method rather than an infection with a
low pathogenic H5N1 strain. This is even more likely since all 3 infected
ducks were found in one location. Further investigations on organ samples
and attempts to isolate virus are ongoing.
