With the death of 22 sheep in Karaikeni between [Sun 6 and Wed 9 May 2018], the district, for the 1st time, recorded the incidence of anthrax infection. According to Regional Joint Director of Animal Husbandry, R Rajasekaran, anthrax infection will be declared endemic to Karenina village next year [2019].

Up to 2 weeks ago, as many as 56 sheep owned by M and R died under mysterious circumstances in Karaikeni village in T Kallupatti block in Peraiyur taluk in the district. Sources said, the 22 sheep that died between Sunday and Wednesday belonged to B and S of the same village.

The officials animal husbandry department later confirmed that the 22 sheep that died after blood oozing from mouth and anus were tested positive for anthrax infection. Nine ailing sheep have been quarantined from the flock. The symptoms of Anthrax which is caused by the spore-forming bacterium _Bacillus anthracis_ will start showing between day one and 2 months after contracting the bacteria. The contagious infection which mainly affects animals is spread usually while grazing. Humans can also get affected if they come in contact with an infected animal or inhale spores. Confirming the infection, Rajasekaran said, "This records Madurai district's 1st incidence of anthrax infection. Five teams, stationed in and around Karikeni, Mangammalpatti, Kolliveeranpatti and Kandiyadevanpatti, have vaccinated 4100 sheep, 1513 goats and 643 cattle so far between [Tue 8 May 2018] and [Wed 9 May 2018]. The vaccination takes 7-14 days to take effect."

He went on to add that [ ...the ] recent downpour in summer triggers bacterial growth in the soil. "Usually, the immune system of the livestock is weakened when it suddenly rains during summer, which could have possibly resulted in anthrax infection," he said. Rajasekaran further noted that the anthrax infection will be declared endemic to Karaikeni village next year [2019], which would mean compulsory and widespread vaccination against anthrax infection for all livestock.

Meanwhile, the shepherds whose livelihood depend only on the sheep have demanded relief from the government for the loss. Following the anthrax outbreak, the sales of mutton have gone down, and chicken sales have shot up. Moreover, declaring the infection endemic to the region could adversely impact the sales of mutton in T Kallupatti area, the locals added.

[Anthrax does not take prisoners. It kills. Therefore it is always best to be aggressive in responding to this disease and even more cost effective to be proactive. Saying it doesn't exist, as the shepherds would prefer, achieves nothing positive. When shepherds are unaccustomed to anthrax and the associated sudden deaths, asking for help is not immediate. One can hope that the inhabitants of Karenina village will be prepared. Even better if their flocks are presented whenever vaccination is announced to happen.
