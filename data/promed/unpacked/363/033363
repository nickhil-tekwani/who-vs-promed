H5N8 HPAI virus detected in a wild bird in Germany
--------------------------------------------------
A healthy common teal shot by hunters in the Northeast of Germany tested positive for highly pathogenic avian influenza virus [HPAIV] H5N8. The bird had been sampled in the frame of an active wild bird monitoring program conducted by the German Federal State of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. Specific H5 and N8 real-time PCRs were positive with RNA extracted from a swab sample (combined oropharyngeal and cloacal) of that duck. Sequencing of short fragments of the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase gene segments revealed complete identity with highly pathogenic H5N8 viruses detected earlier this week in poultry in Germany, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom.

The detection of H5N8 HPAIV in a healthy common teal casts new light on possible introduction routes of the Korean origin H5N8 viruses into Europe. However, intensified active monitoring of aquatic wild birds is required to gain more insight into the prevalence of these viruses in wild bird populations.

[We are very grateful to the German FLI researchers for this significant 1st hand information.

The common teal (_Anas crecca_) has been shown in several studies to be signified as a potential efficient virus carrier, covering long distances within a few days (in one study, one ringed bird covered 640 km [about 398 miles] in 2 days).

The finding underlines the urgent need to minimize the exposure of domestic poultry to wild birds. The risk is particularly serious in relation to free range farms. As recently argued in an FAO appraisal, the fact that the virus is genetically close to a virus from the Republic of Korea where it was shown that wild ducks may be affected without dying, such birds could play a role in the spread of the virus over long distances and further onward transmission to poultry. "Wild birds were linked previously to the spread of H5N1 HPAI virus from Asia to Europe and Africa from 2005 onwards. With regard to H5N8, experts hypothesize that the virus may have travelled during the spring season from eastern Asia into the breeding grounds of migratory birds in Central Asia. These migratory birds may now be carrying the virus with them as they migrate into more moderate climates" (see 20141115.2957974).

Additional outbreaks in the 3 affected European countries -- Germany, the Netherlands and UK -- as well as in their neighbours, should not surprise. - Mod.AS
