A promising surgeon died from Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease which he contracted
through contaminated growth hormone injections he received as a teenager,
an inquest heard yesterday.
He has been described as a meticulous consultant orthopaedic surgeon
destined for international recognition who died at the age of 37 unable to
control his hands. His widow said after the hearing that he died nine days
after the first birthday of his youngest son Robert, but he had never been
able to hold him because of the debilitating disease. He leaves two other
children - Anna, now six, and William, four.
The Department of Health has been found liable for his death and his widow,
a former nurse, is awaiting compensation. So far, 27 people are believed to
have been affected by CJD from contaminated human growth hormones.
Recording a verdict of misadventure, David Mitford, the coroner, said the
treatment had been done with good intentions. He said: "I'm quite satisfied
that the cause of this surgeon's death was CJD that was directly associated
with the administration of the growth hormone."
