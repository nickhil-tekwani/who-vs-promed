Headlines
- In preparation for the 71st World Health Assembly, taking place on 21-26 May [2018], the Director-General's office has finalized the Strategic Action Plan on Polio Transition. The Plan has 3 strategic objectives, which are highly interlinked: a) Sustaining a polio-free world after eradication (with the Post-Certification Strategy as its main pillar); b) Strengthening immunization systems; c) Strengthening emergency preparedness, detection and response capacity. The Plan aims at aligning these objectives with the overall vision of the 13th General Programme of Work and WHO's support at the country level, with the eventual phasing out of resources from the Global Polio Eradication Initiative. The action plan in all official UN languages may be found here.

Summary of newly-reported viruses this week:
- Afghanistan: 1 new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) positive environmental sample has been reported, in Kandahar province.
- Pakistan: 5 new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) positive environmental samples have been reported, 1 in Balochistan province, 2 in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, and 2 in Sindh province.
- Nigeria: 3 circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) positive environmental samples have been confirmed, 1 in Gombe province, and 2 in Jigawa province.

Progress Toward Polio Eradication - Worldwide, January 2016-March 2018
11 May 2018 / 67(18);524-528

Authors: Khan F, Datta SD; Quddus A; Vertefeuille JF, Burns CC; Jorba J; Wassilak SJF

Summary
- What is already known about this topic?
Transmission of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) has not been interrupted in Afghanistan, Nigeria, and Pakistan. A global, synchronized switch to bivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (bOPV, types 1 and 3 only) was completed in April 2016.

- What is added by this report?
Compared with 2016, the number of WPV1 cases overall decreased in 2017. Some transmission of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) has been identified more than 1 year following the switch to bOPV in 2016.

- What are the implications for public health practice?
Interruption of transmission of WPV1 and of cVDPV2 will require addressing persistent challenges to vaccinating every missed child. Until poliovirus eradication is achieved, all countries must maintain high population immunity and sensitive poliovirus surveillance.

In 1988, when an estimated 350 000 cases of poliomyelitis occurred in 125 countries, the World Health Assembly resolved to eradicate polio globally. Transmission of wild poliovirus (WPV) continues uninterrupted in only 3 countries (Afghanistan, Nigeria, and Pakistan) (1), and among the 3 serotypes, WPV type 1 (WPV1) remains the only confirmed circulating type. This report describes global progress toward polio eradication during January 2016-March 2018, and updates previous reports (2). In 2017, 22 WPV1 cases were reported, a 41 percent decrease from the 37 WPV1 cases reported in 2016. As of [24 Apr 2018], 8 WPV1 cases have been reported (7 in Afghanistan and 1 in Pakistan), compared with 5 cases during the same period in 2017. In Pakistan, continuing WPV1 transmission has been confirmed in multiple areas in 2018 by isolation from wastewater samples. In Nigeria, ongoing endemic WPV1 transmission was confirmed in 2016 (3); although WPV was not detected in 2017 or in 2018 to date, limitations in access for vaccination and surveillance in insurgent-held areas in northeastern Nigeria might permit continued undetected poliovirus transmission. Substantial progress toward polio eradication has continued in recent years; however, interruption of WPV transmission will require overcoming remaining challenges to reaching and vaccinating every missed child. Until poliovirus eradication is achieved, all countries must remain vigilant by maintaining high population immunity and sensitive poliovirus surveillance.

Routine Poliovirus Vaccination Coverage
Among infants aged 1 year, the estimated global coverage with 3 doses of poliovirus vaccines (Pol3, mostly oral poliovirus vaccine [OPV]) through routine immunization services was 85 percent in 2016 (the most recent year for which data are available). World Health Organization (WHO)/United Nations Children's Fund estimates for Pol3 coverage in 2016 were 73 percent in the African Region, 92 percent in the Region of the Americas, 80 percent in the Eastern Mediterranean Region, 94 percent in the European Region, 87 percent in the South-East Asia Region, and 95 percent in the Western Pacific Region, with heterogeneity in coverage among countries in all regions.* National Pol3 coverage with the 3rd dose of OPV (OPV3) in the 3 countries with endemic WPV transmission in 2016 was 60 percent in Afghanistan, 72 percent in Pakistan, and 49 percent in Nigeria. OPV3 coverage is substantially lower in areas of WPV transmission, where children in high-risk mobile populations or areas of conflict are repeatedly missed (4,5). Rarely, in areas with low vaccination coverage, Sabin-like viruses can spread and revert to neurovirulence, resulting in outbreaks of disease caused by circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses (cVDPV). Approximately 90 percent of cVPDV cases reported since 2006 have been caused by type 2 (cVDPV2). In countries with recent cVDPV detections, Pol3 coverage was 74 percent in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), 48 percent in Syria, 47 percent in Somalia, and 83 percent in Laos (6). In these countries, OPV3 coverage was substantially lower in subnational areas with cVDPV emergence and transmission.

Following certification of the eradication of WPV type 2 (WPV2) in 2015, a global, synchronized withdrawal of trivalent OPV (tOPV, containing types 1, 2, and 3 live, attenuated polioviruses), and switch to bivalent OPV (bOPV, containing types 1 and 3 only), was completed by the end of April 2016 (7). Starting in 2015, injectable trivalent inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) was introduced into routine immunization schedules in OPV-using countries, generally at 14 weeks of age. Some countries had to delay introduction of IPV until 2018 because of global shortages of the vaccine.

Supplementary Immunization Activities
In 2016, 186 supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) were conducted in 5 WHO regions, during which approximately 2 billion total OPV and IPV doses were administered (Table 1 [Number of supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) conducted, and number of oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) and inactivated poliovirus (IPV) doses administered, by World Health Organization (WHO) region -- worldwide, 2016-2017, available at the source URL]), including 1 264 552 301 (63 percent) doses administered during national immunization days, 710 995 110 (36 percent) during subnational immunization days, and 17 603 036 (1 percent) doses during focused SIAs in areas of known or suspected poliovirus circulation ("mop-up" activities). In the event of cVDPV2 outbreaks, on advice of the monovalent OPV type 2 (mOPV2) Global Advisory Group, the WHO Director-General releases mOPV2 for outbreak response immunization. Of the administered doses, more than half (51 percent) were tOPV and approximately half (47 percent) were bOPV; an additional 1.4 percent were mOPV2, 0.05 percent were IPV plus bOPV, 0.2 percent were IPV alone, and 0.15 percent were fractional IPV (0.1 mL administered intradermally).

In 2017, 172 SIAs were conducted in 5 WHO regions, during which approximately 1.79 billion total OPV and IPV doses were administered, including 1 110 923 756 (62 percent) doses administered during national immunization days, 672 091 158 (38 percent) during subnational immunization days, and 5 696 917 (0.3 percent) during mop-up activities. Of the administered doses, 95 percent were bOPV, 3.9 percent were mOPV2, 0.5 percent were IPV plus bOPV, and 0.2 percent were IPV alone.

Poliovirus Surveillance
Surveillance for acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) is the means of detecting polio cases caused by WPV or cVDPV, confirmed by stool specimen testing through the Global Polio Laboratory Network. The performance of AFP surveillance is assessed through 2 main indicators: sensitivity and completeness of case investigation. An annual nonpolio AFP rate of greater than or equal to 1 case per 100 000 population aged less than 15 years for countries in the WHO regions certified as polio free, or greater than or equal to 2 for all other countries is considered sufficiently sensitive to detect a case of polio, should it occur. Case investigation is considered to be sufficiently complete if at least 80 percent of reported AFP cases have adequate stool specimens collected (i.e., 2 stool specimens collected greater than or equal to 24 hours apart, within 14 days of paralysis onset, with arrival at a WHO-accredited laboratory in good condition). In 2016, among the 4 countries reporting polio cases, 3 (Afghanistan, Nigeria, Pakistan) met both performance indicators and one (Laos) did not. Among the 5 countries reporting polio cases in 2017, 4 (Afghanistan, DRC, Nigeria, Pakistan) met both performance indicators and one (Syria) did not. Although Nigeria and DRC meet AFP surveillance indicators nationally and subnationally in most provinces, both countries are affected by substantial issues in population accessibility and other impediments to AFP surveillance (1). AFP surveillance has been supplemented by environmental surveillance through testing of sewage in many countries, including polio free countries as well as those with endemic transmission (1).

Reported Poliovirus Cases
Countries reporting WPV cases. In 2016, 37 WPV cases were detected (Figure [Number of cases of wild poliovirus, by month of onset - worldwide, January 2015-March 2018* (as of 24 Apr 2018), available at source URL]): 13 (35 percent) in Afghanistan, 20 (54 percent) in Pakistan, and 4 (11 percent) in Nigeria. In 2017, 22 WPV cases were identified: 14 (64 percent) in Afghanistan and 8 (36 percent) in Pakistan. No WPV cases have been identified in countries outside of Afghanistan, Nigeria, and Pakistan since 2014. During [1 Jan - 30 Mar 2018], as of [24 Apr 2018], the low poliovirus transmission season, 8 WPV1 cases were reported (7 in Afghanistan; 1 in Pakistan) (Figure [same as earlier reference, available at source URL]) (Table 2 [Number of reported polio cases, by country - Worldwide, 1 Jan 2016-30 Mar 2018* (as of 24 Apr 2018) available at source URL]).

Afghanistan reported 13 WPV1 cases in 4 districts in 2016, compared with 14 WPV1 cases in 9 districts in 2017 (7.7 percent increase). In 2016, 54 percent of WPV1 cases in Afghanistan were reported from Paktika province in the southeastern region. In 2017, 50 percent of WPV1 cases were reported from Kandahar province in the southern region. During [1 Jan-30 Mar 2018], 7 WPV1 cases were detected (4 in Kandahar province, 1 in Nangahar province, and 2 in Kunar province; the latter 2 provinces are in the eastern region), compared with 3 WPV1 cases detected during the same period in 2017.

Pakistan reported a 60 percent decrease in the number of WPV1 cases, from 20 cases in 4 districts in 2016 to 8 cases in 7 districts in 2017. During [1 Jan-30 Mar 2018], 1 WPV1 case was reported (in Balochistan province), compared with 2 reported during the same period in 2017. WPV1 continues to be isolated from environmental surveillance sites in 5 provinces of the country (Balochistan, Islamabad, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Punjab, and Sindh).

Nigeria reported 4 WPV1 cases in 2016. No WPV1 cases were reported in 2017 and none to date in 2018.

Countries reporting cVDPV cases and isolations. In 2016, 5 cVDPV cases were reported from 3 countries (8). In Laos, an outbreak that began with 8 cVDPV type 1 cases in 2015 continued into 2016 with 3 additional cases reported. One cVDVPV2 case was reported in 2016 in Nigeria and another in Pakistan. In 2017, a total of 96 cVDPV2 cases were reported, including 74 cases from Syria (most recent case in September 2017) and 22 from DRC. The outbreak in DRC has continued into 2018, with 4 cases to date, as of [24 Apr 2018] (the most recent case occurring in February [2018]) (9). Isolation of cVDVP2 from environmental samples in Mogadishu, Somalia, in late 2017 and early 2018, and related cVDPV2 from environmental samples in Nairobi, Kenya, in early 2018, has confirmed long-term cVDPV2 transmission, in a broad area, although no associated polio cases have been detected to date. cVDPV type 3 has been isolated in Mogadishu from sewage samples collected in March 2018, again, with no associated polio cases having been detected to date. In Nigeria, cVDPV2 has been recently detected by environmental surveillance in 2 states in early 2018; no associated polio cases having been detected to date. Response immunization is underway or planned for all these cVDPV cases and isolations.

Discussion
Although substantial progress was made toward polio eradication during 2016-2017, challenges remain in the countries with endemic transmission. Continued circulation of WPV1 has been confirmed in Afghanistan and Pakistan in the 2018 low WPV season, and it remains uncertain if WPV circulation has been interrupted in Nigeria (3).

The number of WPV cases in Afghanistan declined from 2015 to 2016, but the decrease did not continue in 2017. Although negotiations to obtain local access are constantly being undertaken, the number of children who were inaccessible to vaccination in the south and east because of insecurity increased during 2017 (5). In Pakistan, a decline in WPV1 cases since 2014 continued during 2016 and 2017. The detection of WPV in environmental surveillance samples in the absence of WPV-positive AFP cases in several provinces might indicate either surveillance gaps or waning in the intensity of transmission. Intensified SIA schedules and efforts to reach previously unvaccinated children, along with expansion of community-based initiatives employing local permanent vaccinators and ensuring worker safety have helped reduce the number of WPV cases. Large-scale movement of high-risk populations across Pakistan's border with Afghanistan in both directions continues to pose a challenge to interrupting WPV transmission, and cross border collaborative vaccination efforts made in 2017 are being enhanced in 2018 (4).

In Nigeria, WPV1 circulation went undetected from mid-2014 to mid-2016, and the discovery of both endemic WPV1 and long-standing cVDVP2 transmission in 2016 in Borno State illuminated gaps in surveillance. Continued inaccessibility of insurgent-held areas hinders both immunization and surveillance efforts (3). Enhancement of initiatives for collaborating with the military to reach currently unvaccinated children will be helpful in ensuring interruption of WPV transmission. In the other countries of the Lake Chad basin bordering Borno State (Cameroon, Chad, and Niger), problems with inaccessibility related to insecurity and a large number of difficult-to-access islands have been addressed through progressive improvements in microplanning and implementation of SIAs, but uncertainties remain regarding SIA quality and success in interrupting undetected WPV transmission.

Global WPV2 eradication was certified in 2015 after no detection since 1999 (2). WPV type 3 has not been detected since 2012 (2). A minimum of 3 years of sensitive AFP surveillance without detection of WPV is required to certify a WHO region as being polio free (10). Four of 6 WHO regions (the Region of the Americas, European, South-East Asia, and Western Pacific regions) have been certified free of indigenous WPV. Improvements in AFP surveillance performance in critical subnational areas are required to achieve poliofree certification of the African and Eastern Mediterranean regions.

Because efforts to increase immunity to poliovirus type 2 before the global tOPV to bOPV switch did not reach all persistently unvaccinated children in hard-to-reach areas, some cVDPV2 emergences have been detected following the switch. Reaching all children for vaccination in areas with cVDPV2 transmission is also an ongoing challenge.

Although progress toward global polio eradication has continued, challenges in identifying and vaccinating every missed child remain. Much of the recent progress reaching previously missed children has been associated with recruitment of trusted community volunteers who are invested in their locality for vaccination and surveillance efforts. Intensification of efforts to improve the quality of immunization and surveillance activities and to develop additional innovations in addressing persisting challenges is necessary. Until poliovirus eradication is achieved, all countries must remain vigilant by maintaining high population immunity and sensitive poliovirus surveillance.

[4] Surveillance gaps - CIDRAP report
Date: Thu 12 Apr 2018

[Again, sincere apologies for the delayed reporting of this excellent review. - Mod.MPP]

In 2017, the number of global wild poliovirus (WPV) cases sank to its lowest level, and though surveillance markers are improving in many countries, remaining gaps mean that progress is fragile, according to a new snapshot that looked at trends for 2016 and 2017.

Experts from the World Health Organization (WHO) and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported their findings today in the latest edition of Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR). [Surveillance to Track Progress Toward Polio Eradication -- Worldwide, 2016-2017; MMWR. April 13, 2018 / 67(14);418-423 available at: https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/67/wr/mm6714a3.htm]

In 2017, only 22 WPV cases were reported in just 2 countries-Afghanistan and Pakistan. That total was down from 37 cases in 2016 in those 2 countries along with Nigeria. Against that backdrop, the number of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus 2 (cVDPV2) rose over the past 2 years, fueled by outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Syria.

According to the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI), for 2018 so far, only 7 cases have been reported, 6 in Afghanistan and one in Pakistan. In its latest weekly update posted today [Thu 12 Apr 2018], GPEI said no new cases of WPV or cVDPV2 were reported for the week ending [Wed 11 Apr 2018].

In February [2018], the WHO's polio emergency committee met for the 16th time, agreeing to extend the public health emergency of international concern and its related temporary health recommendations.

Access, conflict play roles in gaps
Since intensive efforts began in 1988 to eradicate polio, 4 of the 6 WHO regions have been certified as polio-free. Much of the recent focus has been on countries in the Eastern Mediterranean and African regions, especially 3 that have yet to interrupt WPV transmission: Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Nigeria.

The authors note that 2 metrics are used to measure the quality of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) surveillance, a nonpolio AFP rate of 2 or more and adequate stool specimens from 80 percent or more of patients who have AFP. For 2017, 14 of 20 African countries evaluated met national surveillance indicators, up from 12 in 2016. Last year [2017], however, 5 of 6 countries in the Eastern Mediterranean region met the quality indicators, down from all 6 in 2016.

"Although overall performance improved in 2017, national-level surveillance indicators masked suboptimal surveillance performance at subnational levels in both regions," the group wrote, acknowledging that inaccessible and conflict areas are vulnerable to gaps in tracking.

Regarding sewage sampling, done to flag polio transmission when AFP cases aren't detected, Afghanistan had WPV1 from 4 genetic clusters in 5 provinces in 2017, and in Pakistan, 13 percent of samples were positive for WPV1 in 2017, with positive samples from all 5 provinces. In Africa, recent positive samples included cVDPV2-from Nigeria's Borno state in 2016 and from Somalia in 2017.

Genetic clues
The investigators report that genetic diversity declined in 2017 WPV1 isolates. But 3 of 22 specimens from Afghanistan and Pakistan were considered orphan isolates, with a lower level of genetic relatedness, hinting at possible gaps in AFP surveillance.

Regarding recent cVDPV2 strains, the scientists observed viruses that have diverged from the Sabin parent strain, both in stool specimens from patients with AFP and in environmental samples from the 3 countries.

Surveillance challenges in conflict areas
Though conflict situations limit standard health-facility surveillance, community-based surveillance has been effective at finding AFP cases, the team wrote. For example, strategies include increasing case searchers at internally displaced persons camps, involving the participation of community members in inaccessible areas, and employing active case-searching in newly accessed areas.

"For example, in Somalia, community volunteers have been instrumental in reporting AFP cases in inaccessible and partially accessible areas," they wrote.

They emphasized that the need for strong polio surveillance will remain beyond eradication certification and well after the oral poliovirus vaccine has been phased out globally. "As long as polioviruses continue to circulate in any country, all countries remain at risk," the authors wrote.

Still a bumpy road toward eradication
A report from Stat today [Thu 12 Apr 2018], [Despite high hopes for polio eradication, discouraging news is piling up. Byline Helen Branswell https://www.statnews.com/2018/04/12/polio-eradication-dashed-optimism/] said 2018 marks the 30th anniversary of the global polio eradication push, and despite recent optimism, experts don't think this year [2018] will see the end of the disease.

Michael Zaffran, director of polio eradication for the WHO, told Stat that experts hope polio spread in southern Afghanistan this year [2018] can be stopped, but they are worried about cases in the northeast of the country, an area in which deploying the vaccine and monitoring its use pose safety risks.

On the other hand, Zaffran said developments in Nigeria are raising hopes that polio transmission will be interrupted there, if it hasn't been already. He noted that vaccinators have been able to reach more children, and that no cases were reported in people or in sewage samples in 2017.

He also said the global supply of injectable polio vaccine is starting to increase, with more producers and with them more supply expected in 2020.

[Again, an apology is due for the delayed reports on the global polio situation.
Now, for the good news:
- During the period since the last update [Thu 5 Apr 2018] there has been only 1 case of clinical paralytic polio reported through official channels - a case of cVDPV2 reported from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Date of onset of symptoms of this case was [Mon 19 Feb 2018], in Kikula district, Haut Katanga province. This case was reported during the week ending 26 Apr 2018.
- There were no cases of paralytic polio officially reported due to infection with the wild poliovirus (WPV).
- There were no reports of positive environmental samples in Afghanistan and Pakistan.

Now for the not so good news:
- Each week there are reports of positive sewage samples for both the WPV and of cVDPVs.
Week of report ending 9 May 2018:
- Nigeria: 2 cVDPV2 in Jigawa state.
- Somalia: 1 cVDPV2 in Banadir province, 2 cVDPV3 in Banadir province.
Week of report ending 2 May 2018
- Afghanistan: 1 WPV1 in Kandahar province.
- Pakistan: 5 WPV1s, 1 in Balochistan province, 2 in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, and 2 in Sindh province.
- Nigeria: 3 cVDPV2 1 in Gombe province, and 2 in Jigawa province.
Week of report ending 26 Apr 2018
- Pakistan: 1 WPV1 in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.
- Nigeria: 3 cVDPV2 isolated 10 Jan-20 Mar 2018 from 2 sites in Jigawa state.
- Somalia: cVDPV3 isolated 8-22 Mar 2018 from 2 sites in Banadir province.
Week of report ending 18 Apr 2018
- Pakistan: 2 WPV1, 1 in Sindh province, and 1 in Balochistan province.
- Kenya, cVPDV2 confirmed, linked to the cVDPV2 confirmed from Somalia in March 2018.
Week of report ending 11 Apr 2018
- Kenya, advance notification of cVPDV2 sample collected 21 Mar 2018 from Nairobi, linked to the cVDPV2 from Mogadishu, Somalia.
- Afghanistan: 2 WPV1 in Kandahar province.
- Pakistan: 1 WPV1in Sindh province.

Significance of the positive environmental samples is that both the WPV1 and cVDPVs (predominantly type 2) are circulating, and pose a risk for continued occurrence of clinical cases being identified -- if surveillance is adequate in the affected zones. It is noteworthy that these isolates are predominantly coming from areas with civil strife, or in areas receiving refugees coming from areas of civil strife, where access for both vaccination activities as well as surveillance activities is markedly impeded. The finding that 3 of 22 specimens from Afghanistan and Pakistan were identified as genetic "orphan isolates" is suggestive of surveillance gaps, even in areas considered to have excellent surveillance activities.
