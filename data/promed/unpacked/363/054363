Equine Herpesvirus Myeloencephalopathy Confirmed in Virginia
--------------
Detection of a neurological illness in Virginia thought to be equine
herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1) myeloencephalopathy was recently confirmed as such at
several laboratories throughout the United States.
The organism causing EHV-1 can cause 3 different forms of the disease:
rhinopneumonitis, a respiratory disease of mostly young horses; abortions in
pregnant mares; and this neurologic disease. There are at least 7 other
strains of equine herpesviruses, named in order of their discovery.
In late April 2002, 4 horses at Fox Chase Farm in Middleburg, Virginia.,
displayed the mysterious symptoms of the neurological form of EHV-1; 3 of
the horses were euthanized and 1 pony recovered with supportive care.
Joseph P. Garvin, DVM, is the laboratory director of the Virginia Department
of Agriculture and Consumer Services' Warrenton Regional Animal Health
Laboratory, where the autopsies of the second and third horses were
performed. "No more cases surfaced -- only the ones at the original
premises," said Garvin. "It's still not known where it came from. It could
have come from any number of places."
Garvin's Warrenton, Virginia-based laboratory personnel performed necropsies
on 2 of the affected horses and sent tissue from the horses to various
facilities with the ability to test for EHV. The first confirmation of EHV-1
that Garvin received was from the University of Kentucky's Gluck Equine
Research Center. The treating practitioner had sent whole blood from one of
the affected horses prior to its death to the Lexington, Kentucky research
laboratory for isolation of the virus.
The United States Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health
Inspection Service scientists isolated the virus from the brain of that
horse at the Ames, Iowa National Veterinary Services Laboratory.
Additionally, Michigan State University received spinal cord tissue from
both of the horses for polymerase chain reaction tests, which detected the
DNA of EHV within the tissue.
