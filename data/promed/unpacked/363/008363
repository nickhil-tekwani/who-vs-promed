First report of _Pseudomonas viridiflava_ on melon in Turkey
------------------------------------------------------------

Protection, Faculty of Agriculture, Cukurova University, 01330 Balcali,

Agriculture, Ataturk University, 25240 Erzurum, Turkey). Accepted for
publication 06/05/03
In February 2003, a severe disease with bacterial leaf necrosis symptoms
was observed on container-grown melon (_Cucumis melo_ cv. Nun) seedlings at
a nursery in Adana, located in the eastern Mediterranean region of Turkey.
A number of water-soaked lesions were first observed on the undersides of
the cotyledons. Small, dark brown and angular leaf spots were subsequently
observed on the true leaves at later stages of the disease. Disease
incidence was estimated as about 10 per cent and some of the infected
seedlings in the nursery evntually died. The disease resulted in the
rejection of 10 000 transplants from the nursery. These symptoms were
consistent with those of the disease described by Goumans & Chatzaki (1998).
A fluorescent, opaque, semifluid, Gram negative bacterium was isolated from
diseased tissues onto King's medium B (King et al, 1954). All 10
representative strains isolated were aerobic, rod shaped, Gram negative,
oxidase and arginine dihydrolase negative, and catalase and pectolytic
positive. The bacterial strains did not produce levan type colonies on
sucrose nutrient agar, but were able to induce a hypersensitive reaction on
tobacco leaves. The strains were capable of producing acid from sorbitol,
fructose, glucose, L (+) arabinose, D (+) xylose, D (-) mannitol, but not
from sucrose, trehalose, maltose, melibiose, lactose and D (-) arabinose.
Utilisation of D (-) tartrate was positive. Fatty acid analysis identified
the strains as _Pseudomonas viridiflava_ [Pv] with similarity indices
ranging from 59 to 89 per cent (Janse et al, 1992).
Pathogenicity of the strains was confirmed on melon seedlings (cv. Nun) by
needle inoculation of bacterial suspensions containing 100 million CFU
(colony forming units) per mL in 0.85 per cent saline. Saline was used as
negative control. The plants were maintained in the controlled climate room
for a week at 25 C and 70 per cent relative humidity (RH).
Pv was reisolated from the inoculated plants and is identical to the
original strain (GSPB 1685, obtained from Gottingen, Germany) on the basis
of fatty acid analysis. Water-soaked lesions and leaf necrosis, similar to
those observed in the nursery, developed on the inoculated plants within 5
to 7 days. No symptoms developed on control plants. To date there is only a
single previous report of melon as host of Pv from Greece (Goumans &
Chatzaki, 1998). This is the first report of the occurrence of Pv causing
bacterial leaf spot and necrosis on melon in Turkey.

[Pv is basically a weak, opportunistic pathogen with a varied natural host
range (including pear, bean, cauliflower, cabbage, sweet pepper, pea and
canola). In onion, Pv causes severe damage and post-harvest damage during
storage can also be very high. -Mod.DH]
