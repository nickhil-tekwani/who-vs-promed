For information, I have copied the relevant sections from the 16th edition
of CCDM [Benenson's "Control of Communicable Diseases in Man" (the CD-ROM
version), and the antimicrobial chemoprophylaxis section from the most
recent ACIP statement on the "Control and Prevention of Meningococcal
Disease".
..................................................
Meningococcal meningitis - section 9B (Control of patient, contacts and
the immediate environment) - From the 16th edition of CCDM (1995)
5) Protection of contacts: Close surveillance of household and other
intimate contacts for early signs of illness, especially fever, to
initiate appropriate therapy without delay; prophylactic administration
of an effective chemotherapeutic agent to intimate contacts (household
contacts and people socially close enough to have shared eating
utensils, e.g., close friends at school but not the whole class).
Younger children in daycare centers are exceptions and, even if not
close friends, all should be given prophylaxis after an index case is
identified. If the organisms in the outbreak are sulfonamide-resistant
or of unknown sulfonamide sensitivity, rifampin can be used, giving
adults 600 mg twice a day for 2 days; children over 1 month old, 10
mg/kg; and for those less than 1 month old, 5 mg/kg.
For adults, ceftriaxone, 250 mg IM, given in a single dose, is
effective; 125 mg IM for children under 15 years of age. Ciprofloxacin,
500 mg PO, may be given as a single dose to adults. If the organisms
have been shown to be sensitive to sulfadiazine, it may be given to
adults and older children at a dosage of 1.0 g every 12 hours for 4
doses; for infants and children, the dosage is 125-150 mg/kg/day divided
into 4 equal doses, on each of 2 consecutive days. As of 1993,
sulfadiazine is no longer manufactured in the USA, and assistance may be
needed from CDC to obtain this sulfa drug. Healthcare personnel are
rarely at risk even when caring for infected patients; only intimate
exposure to nasopharyngeal secretions (e.g., as in mouth-to-mouth
resuscitation) warrants prophylaxis. There would be insufficient time
for immunization of close household contacts to be of any value.=20
6) Investigation of contacts and source of infection: Throat or
nasopharyngeal cultures are of no value in deciding who should receive
prophylaxis since carriage is variable and there is no consistent
relationship between that found in the normal population and in an
epidemic.=20
7) Specific treatment: Penicillin given parenterally in adequate doses
is the drug of choice for proven meningococcal disease; ampicillin and
chloramphenicol are also effective. However, strains resistant to
penicillin have been reported in Africa and Spain. Treatment should
begin immediately when the presumptive clinical diagnosis is made, even
before meningococci have been identified. In children, until the
specific etiologic agent has been identified, the therapy must be
effective against H. influenzae type b (Hib) as well as S. pneumoniae.
While ampicillin is the drug of choice for both as long as the organisms
are ampicillin-sensitive, it should be combined with a third-generation
cephalosporin or chloramphenicol in the many places where
ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae b strains are known to occur.
Patients with meningococcal or Hib disease should be given rifampin
prior to discharge from the hospital to assure elimination of the
organism.=20
C. Epidemic measures:=20
1) When an outbreak occurs, major emphasis must be placed on careful
surveillance, early diagnosis and immediate treatment of suspected
cases. A high index of suspicion is invaluable.
=20
2) Separate individuals, and ventilate living and sleeping quarters of
all people who are exposed to infection because of crowding or congested
living conditions; e.g., soldiers, miners and prisoners.=20
3) When the epidemic strain is sulfonamide-sensitive, mass
chemoprophylaxis of a small closed community with sulfadiazine (0.5 g
for children, 1.0 g for adults, every 12 hours for 4 doses) reduces the
carrier rate and limits spread of the infection. Because of the current
widespread prevalence of sulfonamide-resistant meningococcal strains
throughout the world, sulfonamide prophylaxis should not be instituted
if more than 5% of the strains obtained from cases or from a
statistically valid sample of the carrier population show sulfonamide
resistance (resistant strains are those resistant to more than 10 mg% of
sulfadiazine). Rifampin reduces the carrier rate and limits spread of
infection when the entire community is treated; however, since its use
has been associated with the appearance of resistant strains, this drug
is not recommended for mass prophylaxis. It may be advisable to
administer prophylaxis to all intimate contacts (see 9B5, above).=20

Control and Prevention of Meningococcal Disease: Recommendations of the
Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)
ANTIMICROBIAL CHEMOPROPHYLAXIS=20
Antimicrobial chemoprophylaxis of close contacts of sporadic cases of
meningococcal disease is the primary means for prevention of
meningococcal disease in the United States. Close contacts include=20
a) household members,=20
b) day care center contacts, and=20
c) anyone directly exposed to the patient=EDs oral secretions (e.g., through
kissing,
mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, endotracheal intubation, or endotracheal
tube management).=20
The attack rate for household contacts exposed to
patients who have sporadic meningococcal disease has been estimated to
be four cases per 1,000 persons exposed, which is 500-800 times greater
than for the total population.=20
Because the rate of secondary disease for
close contacts is highest during the first few days after onset of
disease in the primary patient, antimicrobial chemoprophylaxis should be
administered as soon as possible (ideally within 24 hours after the case
is identified). Conversely, chemoprophylaxis administered greater than 14
days after onset of illness in the index case-patient is probably of
limited or no value.=20
Oropharyngeal or nasopharyngeal cultures are not
helpful in determining the need for chemoprophylaxis and may
unnecessarily delay institution of this preventive measure.=20
Rifampin is
administered twice daily for 2 days (600 mg every 12 hours for adults,
10 mg/kg of body weight every 12 hours for children equal to or greater
than 1 month of age, and 5 mg/kg every 12 hours for infants less than 1
month of age). Rifampin is effective in eradicating nasopharyngeal
carriage of N. meningitidis. Rifampin is not recommended for pregnant
women, because the drug is teratogenic in laboratory animals. Rifampin
changes the color of urine to reddish-orange and is excreted in tears
and other body fluids; it may cause permanent discoloration of soft
contact lenses. Because the reliability of oral contraceptives may be
affected by rifampin therapy, consideration should be given to using
alternate contraceptive measures while rifampin is being administered.
In addition to rifampin, other antimicrobial agents are effective in
reducing nasopharyngeal carriage of N. meningitidis. Ciprofloxacin in
various dosage regimens is more than 90% effective in eradicating
nasopharyngeal carriage. A single 500-mg oral dose of ciprofloxacin is a
reasonable alternative to the multidose rifampin regimen. Ciprofloxacin
levels in nasal secretions far exceed the MIC90 for N. meningitidis
following oral dosing. Ciprofloxacin is not generally recommended for
persons more than 18 years of age or for pregnant and lactating women
because the drug causes cartilage damage in immature laboratory animals.
However, a recent international consensus report has concluded that
ciprofloxacin can be used for chemoprophylaxis of children when no
acceptable alternative therapy is available. When ceftriaxone was
administered in a single parenteral dose (an intramuscular dose of 125
mg for children and 250 mg for adults), it was 97%-100% effective in
eradicating pharyngeal carriage of N. meningitidis. Thus, ceftriaxone
(diluted in 1% lidocaine to reduce local pain after injection) is also a
reasonable alternative for chemoprophylaxis. Systemic antimicrobial
therapy of meningococcal disease with agents other than ceftriaxone or
other third-generation cephalosporins may not reliably eradicate
nasopharyngeal carriage of N. meningitidis. If other agents have been
used for treatment, the index patient should receive chemoprophylactic
antibiotics for eradication of nasopharyngeal carriage before being
discharged from the hospital.
