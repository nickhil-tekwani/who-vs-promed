Suspicion of FMD, serotype SAT-2 in southern Gaza Strip
-------------------------------------------------------
1. On Fri 13 Apr 2012, an official veterinarian from the Gaza Strip reported about a cattle herd of 350 adult animals in Rafah (adjacent to the borders with Egypt and Israel) where 5 animals showed typical FMD clinical signs. Several days later, increased salivation was observed in 3 out of 120 head in a 2nd herd. Reportedly, so far the number of cases remains unchanged, an observation which is not typical for an FMD outbreak in a susceptible, unvaccinated population. It should, however be kept in mind that the clinical signs in cattle and sheep under extensive husbandry conditions and in pasture may, at times, be mild, undiagnosed, and unreported.

2. Samples from the 2 herds were submitted to the FMD laboratory of the Kimron Veterinary Institute. From the 2nd herd, a virus has been isolated which has been primarily identified as FMD virus of the serotype SAT-2. Additional tests are in progress and material has been submitted to the WRLFMD [Pirbright] in UK for confirmation and characterisation.

3. Until final clarification of diagnosis and although the clinical picture does not show the expected severity, we must take into consideration the possibility that the event is caused by the same virus responsible for the huge epizootic in Egypt, which has been evolving for about 3 months, causing sickness, mortality, and very vast losses in all districts, including several cases reported from North Sinai.

4. As part of the measures undertaken by the Veterinary Services in Israel, prior to Passover [6-14 Apr 2012] cattle, small ruminants [sheep and goats] in a protection zone around the Gaza strip were vaccinated. Dairy cattle in the same zone are currently being revaccinated.

5. Animal movement restrictions have been implemented. The southern part of Israel has been declared a high risk region. All movements of cattle and small ruminants from south to north Israel have been prohibited. A "boundary line" between the South and the North has been outlined in a circular distributed by the Head of the Field Veterinary Services, extending from the Mediterranean (Ashkelon) in the west to the Dead Sea (Neve Zohar) to the east [see further for the map of the "boundary line"].

[Articles 6 and 7 include instructions concerning the issuance of permits and road inspection data].

8. The Veterinary Services are promoting the purchase of additional vaccine doses, despite the limited global reserve. Additional doses, when arrived, will be used to enhance immunization within the protection zone and as reserve in the case of outbreaks in other parts of the country.

9. The Veterinary Services will disseminate information to the breeders, which will facilitate early identification of the disease.

10. Though signs of FMD by different strains of the virus are generally similar, it is important to remember that the SAT-2 virus may cause a much more dramatic morbidity than the familiar disease, due to lack of immunization. The presentation of the disease in unvaccinated populations may be stormy, extensive, and very damaging. During recent years, most cases in Israel were caused by FMDV-O, in vaccinated herds with low morbidity. But in several flocks, particularly dairy sheep or goats, the disease caused high mortality in young animals and high morbidity/mortality in adults due to complications such as mastitis.

11. Sporadic or stormy occurrence of sudden mortalities in offspring of cattle, small ruminants or swine may be the only sign of FMD. Early notification of any suspicion, as close as possible to its very onset, is essential to prevent a wide-scale outbreak within and among herds. Veterinarians are being called upon to instruct and guide breeders, suppliers, service-providers and others about the infectivity, spreading-capacity, clinical signs of the disease, and the ways to prevent its spread.

[Articles 12-16 are not translated. The circular includes pictures of FMD in cattle and a map, which is also available in a circular dated 18 Apr 2012, available at http://tinyurl.com/cle5uua. - Mod.AS]

[According to the Palestinian Autonomous Territories (PAT) OIE notification, near the farm reportedly infected by FMDV SAT-2 there is another cattle "farm with 400 heads, infected with FMD O serotype." This is probably the farm described in Dr Galon's circular as suspected on 13 Apr 2012, without laboratory results. Details from PAT will be helpful.

FAO's Animal Production and Health Division (AGA) update of 19 Apr 2012, available at http://tinyurl.com/cshn77s, includes the following relevant information:

"1. FAO and EuFMD are negotiating to find sources for vaccines in the event of further spread [from Egypt and/or Libya] of FMD and a worsening of the situation.

"2. Independent of the FAO's activity, Israel has implemented targeted vaccination along its southern borders, to create a buffer zone of protection for the animal herds most at risk. Israel is supporting the Gaza Strip by making 20 000 vaccine doses available immediately from its own supplies, to cover valuable cattle. A further 40 000 doses will be made available for the small ruminant population (mostly sheep and goats) ["small" refers to "ruminant" -- the population is estimated at 70 000, 3.5 times the cattle population. - Mod.JW].

"3. Israel is arranging to bring in additional doses to revaccinate when and where it will be most helpful, either within the country or by sharing vaccines with neighbours."

Confirmation of the diagnosis of the (clinically odd) cases in Rafah (PAT, Gaza Strip) as FMDV SAT-2 and results of the isolate's genotyping by the WRLFMD, Pirbright, are anticipated with interest and concern. - Mod.AS]
