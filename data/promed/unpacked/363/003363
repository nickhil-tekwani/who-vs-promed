A spike in poison mushroom cases -- including a Kalamazoo 2-year-old
-- has prompted the Michigan Department of Community Health to issue
this warning to mushroom hunters: Be sure you know what you're eating
and how to prepare it correctly.

At least 11 Michigan people have been hospitalized so far this year
[2011] with severe toxicity after eating [poisonous] mushrooms. Last
year, there were no hospitalizations.

"We've had 53 calls so far this year [2011]," said Susan Smolinske,
director of the Children's Hospital of Michigan Regional Poison
Control Center in Detroit, the poison center for the state. "Last year
at this time, we had 26 (calls)."

The culprit is largely 2 mushrooms -- the beefsteak (_Gyromitra
esculenta_) and early morel (_Verpabohemica_ spp.), Smolinske said.

Both mushrooms are commonly mistaken for true morels, the Michigan
delicacy that sends gourmets into a frenzy every year. But even true
morels can make people sick if they are improperly prepared, or if
they are consumed with alcohol or in large quantities or by people who
have developed sensitivity to the mushrooms, Smolinske said.

Untreated, people who eat false morels may develop confusion,
delirium, seizures or go into coma. All of the people hospitalized
this year [2011] have recovered, Smolinske said, but 3 of them
suffered serious liver damage, including one who was temporarily
placed on a liver transplant list. The health department alert states
that the onset of illness after consuming beefsteak or early morel
mushrooms is usually 6 to 48 hours.

Symptoms include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea,
dizziness, headache, muscle cramps, bloating and fatigue. Signs of
liver damage include right-sided abdominal pain, hepatitis and
jaundice (yellow skin) within 48 hours.

True morels (_Morchella_ species) can make people sick too if
undercooked or eaten raw, or if they are eaten with alcoholic
beverages. Toxicity begins within a few hours and includes nausea,
vomiting and abdominal pain lasting less than 24 hours, the health
department advisory says.

Some people are genetically vulnerable, or develop a sensitivity to
true morels, even after eating them for years without incident,
Smolinske said. "It is a kind of Russian roulette," she said, since
people don't know when that sensitivity is developing until they
become ill.

Chefs are well acquainted with the specifics of mushroom
identification. "In everything we do, we buy from approved sources,
folks we trust, people we have developed relationships with," said
Matthew Pietsch, executive chef at Salt of the Earth restaurant in
Fennville.

That is especially important for a commodity like morel mushrooms,
which are not cultivated but found in the wild.

This season Pietsch has been paying between USD 25 and 30 for a pound
of morel mushrooms, about half of a gallon-sized Ziplock bag.

"We go through and clean each one by hand," he said. "We see the
morel mushroom as a beautiful, delicate ingredient. It's like gold to
us."

In his years as a chef, Pietsch said he has never encountered an
order that contained the wrong mushroom species.

There are definitely more people selling mushrooms this season than
there have been in past years, he said. "It's great that some
centuries-old practices are being revived, and it's wonderful people
are finding these treasures here in Michigan; we're so lucky," he
said. "But when people get sick because of lack of awareness on the
part of finders or providers, it's a double-edged sword."

As the saying among mycologists/fungus experts goes: "There are old
mushroom hunters, and there are bold mushroom hunters, but there are
no old, bold mushroom hunters," Smolinske said.

"Unless you are on a foray with a mycologist, it's a hazard."

[To avoid illness, or liability, go hunting for the culinary
delicacies with a trained mycologist, not just a self-proclaimed
mycologist that says they have never gotten sick. Mushrooms are
fascinating, and it can take long years of study to spot the delicate
differences in these species.

While hunting for mushrooms in the USA is as big a pastime as
anywhere else, we seldom hear of the poisonings that can result from
misidentification of the fungi. I cannot help but wonder whether the
extra rain and cool temperatures later in the year have caused an
increase in the look-alike, more poisonous varieties. - Mod.TG]

WARNING: do NOT try to make a definitive identification from these
photos. In France, during the autumn (fall) mushreoom season, every
pharmacy dosplays actual specimens of poisonous species in their
windows, and the pharmacist can identify people's harvests. - Mod.JW]
