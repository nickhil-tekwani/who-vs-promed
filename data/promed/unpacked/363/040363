Chief veterinary officer of the Directorate of Veterinary Services (DVS) Dr Milton Maseke yesterday assured Namibians that the country is still foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] free.

He was reacting to media reports circulating about a new outbreak of FMD in Ohangwena Region, calling such claims false and devoid of any truth.

At an urgent media briefing yesterday [Wed 11 May 2016], Maseke dismissed the claims of Governor Usko Nghaamwa, who told Nampa that the re-appearance of the disease was detected in Okongo Constituency over the past few days.

Nghaamwa drew this conclusion after a series of information-sharing meetings were held by State veterinarians with farmers, cattle herders and villages as part of an ongoing campaign to ensure the dreaded disease does not spread south from Angola.

Governor Nghaamwa claimed the disease was present in animals in the villages of Oshikome, Ombongola, Okakango, kaShapwa, Okanyandi West, Ohiki, Omufimba, Ondamayomunghete, Ombabi, Okalupalelona and Oshishogolo.

Maseke says the misunderstanding stems from announcements made by DVS officials during such community meetings along the Namibian/Angolan border that were convened to discuss the importance of reporting cross-border movement of livestock and to train farmers in the recognition of FMD symptoms.

[A major outbreak of FMD, serotype SAT2, reportedly started on 11 May 2015 in northern Namibia, along its border with Angola, initially in the district Ohangwena. The disease spread into 3 additional northern districts, namely Omusati, Kavango and Oshikoto, causing a total of 27 reported outbreaks. This event was declared resolved 25 Jan 2016. The 10 reports submitted to the OIE, with a map showing the locations of the 27 outbreaks, are available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=17724.

Namibia's regular reporting history to the OIE reflects its specific obligations as a (beef) exporting country.

Angola, which is not an exporting country, has submitted 2 reports on FMD during the recent 2 years, namely in May 2015 and 10 May 2016 (see postings listed below). In both cases, the causative agent remained "untyped" (typing pending).

The FMDV serotype SAT2 which caused the epizootic in northern Namibia was, most likely, introduced from Angola and is, probably, continuing its circulation there, causing the current outbreaks. Its re-introduction into adjacent Namibian territory would not be surprising. - Mod.AS
