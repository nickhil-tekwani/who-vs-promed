PNEUMONIA, PEDIATRIC CHINA (SHANGHAI): REQUEST FOR INFORMATION
****************
A ProMED-mail post

ProMED-mail is a program of the

ProMED has received a report of a pediatric case of severe pneumonia & 5
deaths in the ICU at Fudan Hospital, Shanghai. It is not clear whether the 5
deaths were also pneumonia, nor over what time period those deaths took
place. The pneumonia case had recently arrived by bus from Gaungdong
province before falling ill in Shanghai.

Clinically, SARS has not been as severe in children as in adults � see 2003
ref. below. But in view of the importance to surveillance for SARS and
influenza of a sentinel event such as this might possibly be, we request that
anyone with further details inform ProMED immediately.
