Red squirrels dying after picking up human bacteria from animal lovers
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The bacterium, which is found on the hands and skin of humans, has
been found in a number of dead squirrels displaying lesions and
infections. However, scientists were not clear whether the infection
was the primary cause of death.

Wildlife experts said that the problem was particularly evident on
the Isle of Wight, the only place in Britain with no competing grey
squirrels, and where residents commonly leave food out for red squirrels.

The bacterium, _Staphylococcus aureus_, is found naturally in humans,
usually in the nose or on the skin. A report in the professional
journal, Veterinary Record, found that lesions had been found on 11
dead squirrels in the Isle of Wight and Jersey in 2007 and 2008.

The report said: "It is common practice for people on the Isle of
Wight to provide the squirrels with supplementary food, and this
raises the possibility that feeding stations may be contaminated by
staphylococci of human origin."

Vic Simpson, of the private Wildlife Veterinary Investigation Centre
in Cornwall, who submitted the report, said: "We either have a
totally new squirrel disease or it is possible that squirrels are
picking up these human bacteria. It may be that squirrels who already
have immune problems are more susceptible.

"At present we wouldn't advise people to stop feeding squirrels but
if following further research it appears the squirrels are dying as a
result of picking up these bacteria we would advise people on wearing
gloves or washing their hands before leaving food out.

Red squirrels are already under severe pressure from more competitive
greys, introduced to Britain from America in the 19th century, and
the squirrelpox virus, which greys can carry with no symptoms.

Mortality in red squirrels (_Sciurus vulgaris_) associated with
exudative dermatitis
----------------------------------------------------------------------
[Authors: VR Simpson, J Hargreaves, DJ Everest, et al.]

Abstract
--------
Red squirrels (_Sciurus vulgaris_) found dead or dying on the Isle of
Wight and the island of Jersey were suffering from exudative,
ulcerative dermatitis and superficial staphylococcal pyoderma. The
principal gross lesions were on the lips, eyelids, and feet and
showed similarities to those of squirrelpox. The histopathological
lesions were also similar and, although there was no ballooning
degeneration of epidermal cells, intracytoplasmic inclusions
resembling those seen in poxvirus infections were present.
Examination of lesions by electron microscopy failed to identify any
virions, and PCR analysis for squirrelpox virus proved negative. The
skin lesions also resembled those of mange, but although numerous
mites were present in the fur these were mostly _Dermacarus
sciurinus_ with small numbers of _Metalistrophorus pagenstecheri_.
The occurrence of these species on red squirrels in Britain is
confirmed, but neither is pathogenic and they were not considered to
have been involved in the pathogenesis of the dermatitis, the primary
cause of which was not established [But see item 3 further].

_Staphylococcus aureus_ ST49 infection in red squirrels
-----------------------------------------------------
[Authors: V Simpson, N Davison, L Hudson, and AM Whatmore]

A paper in this issue of Veterinary Record describes dermatitis in
red squirrels (_Sciurus vulgaris_) (Simpson and others, pp 59-62)
[see item 2 above]. We wish to report some additional observations.

In 2009, a red squirrel on the Isle of Wight died after showing
respiratory distress. On postmortem examination, the tongue was
unremarkable apart from a small ulcer on the margin, but the
nasopharyngeal mucosa was inflamed and thickened, with many 1 to 2 mm
diameter whitish, plaque-like lesions. The laryngeal mucosa was also
thickened and covered in irregular whitish material. Froth was
present in the trachea, and both lungs appeared congested with
localised areas of consolidation and marginal emphysema.

Impression smears from the mucosal surface of the larynx and
nasopharynx revealed large numbers of both small and large
Gram-positive cocci plus smaller numbers of Gram-negative bacilli.
Cultures of larynx and lung yielded heavy growths of a large
Gram-positive coccus, which was identified by the RAPIDEC
(bioMerieux) test as _Staphylococcus aureus_. An additional small
Gram-positive coccus was isolated from larynx and lung after extended
culture. This could not be identified using API systems (bioMerieux).
Subsequent 16S rRNA sequence analysis suggested that the isolate
represents a previously undescribed bacterium showing only
approximately 93 per cent sequence similarity to members of the genus
_Granulicatella_.

Histological examination of the tongue, nasopharynx, and larynx
showed mucosal ulceration and necrosis of underlying tissues
associated with colonies of Gram-positive cocci. In consolidated
areas of lung there was fluid accumulation in alveoli and
infiltration by neutrophils and macrophages around foci of what
appeared to be plant material. It was concluded that the squirrel had
died of inhalation pneumonia and staphylococcal septicaemia secondary
to laryngeal ulceration and necrosis. The significance of the novel
coccus resembling _Granulicatella_ species is unclear.

As with the skin lesions described in red squirrels from the Isle of
Wight and Jersey [see item 2 above], the oral lesions in this
squirrel were considered to be most unusual. In view of this, the
staphylococcal isolates from the two 2008 cases with skin lesions and
that from this latest case were examined by multilocus sequence
typing (MLST). All 3 were shown to be _S aureus ST49_.

Interrogation of the _S aureus_ MLST database showed that this ST has
previously been associated with 2 human isolates and a single porcine
isolate (<http://saureus.mlst.net>; accessed 4 Jul 2010).

It is common practice for people on the Isle of Wight to provide the
squirrels with supplementary food, and this raises the possibility
that feeding stations may be contaminated by staphylococci of human
origin. We hope to carry out further investigations to determine
whether _S. aureus_ ST49 is part of the normal bacterial flora of red
squirrels or whether it is an opportunist pathogen, possibly of human origin.

[WHO defines a zoonosis as an infection "shared in nature by man and
animals." This is simple and elegant and implies that there is no
need to coin terms to define the direction of infection. However, for
the sake of clarity, the term "reverse zoonoses" has sometimes been
applied for diseases of humans that infect animals. Such could also
be the case if/when the event in red squirrels described above is
confirmed as resulting from human vectors. - Mod.AS]
