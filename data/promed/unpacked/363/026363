The Hunter Olive Association says it has discovered a new [to the
region] fungal disease affecting olive crops across the region. Dr
Vera Sergeeva, an expert in olive disease, noticed the fungal
cercosporiosis growing in local groves.

Association Vice-President Mike Wilson says while it is a nuisance and
can damage the fruit, it is easily treated by spraying copper on the
back of the leaves. He says the fungus grows well in the region's high
humidity and moderate temperatures.

Mr Wilson is warning olive growers to be on the lookout for the
fungus. "[It's] just a matter of being able to identify it," he said.
"It's all to do with prevention. The only downside is you have to
actually spray the leaves on the back, which is fairly difficult with
conventional equipment."

[Cercospora leaf spot (also called cercospora leaf mould,
cercosporiosis) of olives is a serious defoliating disease caused by
_Pseudocercospora cladosporioides_. It was 1st identified in 1984 on
new olive cultivars in Montenegro. Symptoms include black "sooty"
fungal growth on the underside of the leaves, leaf yellowing, leaf
drop without leaf spots and sunken spots of fruit. The disease results
in defoliation and weakening of trees, which delay fruit ripening as
well as reducing oil content and next season's fruit set. Symptoms may
be confused with those of some other fungi or abiotic disorders. The
disease is favoured by humid conditions.

Although the disease is found in most olive growing regions of the
world, not much is known about its epidemiology and population
structure. Spread is likely to occur by means similar to other fungi
causing cercospora spots on various crops, including crop debris,
water and mechanical means. Disease management relies mainly on timely
fungicide applications. Susceptibility of olive cultivars to
cercospora spot varies.
