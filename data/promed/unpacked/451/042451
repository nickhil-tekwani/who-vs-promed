On 3 Apr 2013, the Zhejiang Provincial Health Department released information about the 2 previous confirmed [human] cases of H7N9 avian influenza infection in Hangzhou City. The epidemiological investigation on the 2nd confirmed case showed that before onset of illness, the patient had bought and eaten quails from the live poultry stalls in Binsheng agricultural firm in Shangcheng District, thereby confirming that these are risk factors for the infection.

In order to ensure public health safety, the authorities in the city have rapidly organized teams in the early morning today [6 Apr 2013] and culled the live poultry stored in the Binsheng agricultural firm. Trading of live poultry [presumably birds in other stalls. - Mod.MHJ] in the firm was also suspended.

[I suspect that until an effective avian vaccine can be developed any control attempts are of minimal impact, especially when retroactive as in this instance and in a poultry industry with no biosecurity or proactive disease management. - Mod.MHJ
