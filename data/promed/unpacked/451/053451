Suspected H5N1 outbreak in Romania
----------------------------------
A suspected bird flu outbreak has been reported in a remote Romanian
village, the Sanitary and Veterinary Authority said on Saturday [27
Mar 2010]. Samples of 2 dead hens were sent for confirmation of the
potentially deadly H5N1 virus to the Animal Health Institute in
Bucharest and on to the Weybridge laboratory in Britain, the Authority
said.

The poultry in the small private farm at a village on the Danube Delta
were slaughtered and the area disinfected. "There is currently no
risk of the disease spreading," the Authority said.

A bird flu outbreak was reported 2 weeks ago in the nearby village of
Letea close to the Ukrainian border, the 1st case in Europe for a
year. The previous case in the European Union had been confirmed in
March 2009 in a wild duck shot during a hunt near Starnberg, in
Bavaria, southern Germany [see ProMED archive below].

Romania was hit by massive bird flu outbreaks in 2005 and 2006, when
more than a million poultry were slaughtered.

Avian influenza or "bird flu" is a highly contagious viral disease
which primarily affects birds, but on rare occasions can also be
contracted by humans and other mammals.

On Wednesday [24 Mar 2010], the World Health Organisation said the
H5N1 virus remains a threat to humans, after bird flu outbreaks killed
7 people in several countries since the beginning of the year.

[These 2 new outbreaks occur in the same region, namely the Danube
Delta, where the first HPAI H5N1 outbreak in Romania started in
October 2005 and was resolved in April 2006. For a summary of the
2005/6 epizootic and a map showing all foci, see
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=5189>. The
virus was, most probably, introduced in 2005 by infected migratory
birds. The Delta is characterised by the plentiful avian population in
an expanse of wetlands and a flyway for migrating birds. A similar
route of introduction deserves to be considered currently.

The Romanian 2005 epizootic was accompanied by a massive outbreak in
another territory on the shores of the Black Sea, namely Ukraine's
Crimean peninsula. Enhanced surveillance there deserves to be
advisable now. - Mod.AS]

[Note from the ProMED archives below that these are the 1st outbreaks
in poultry in Europe since October 2008.
