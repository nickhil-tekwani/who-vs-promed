An outbreak of mumps has hit students at Brasenose College [Oxford University, England]. Last night [20 May 2014] there were 18 confirmed cases reported over the last 5 days at the Radcliffe Square college [Brasenose College]. Health authorities are now working to contain the outbreak.

The college's bursar Philip Parker said: "There have been 18 cases. All of those students have either gone home or we're segregating them from other students with a quarantine area. "Of course we're concerned, but we've acted well and taken steps to contain it." University spokesman Matt Pickles said: "The college is working with the college nurse and doctors and taking advice from Health Protection Agency to ensure that the best advice and information is provided to students, including the signs and symptoms to look out for. The college is advising any students who suspect they might have mumps-like symptoms to stay in their room and phone the college nurse or GP for advice." He added that all new students coming to the university are strongly recommended to seek vaccination with 2 doses of the MMR [measles, mumps, rubella] vaccine before they arrive in Oxford.

Mumps is a contagious virus, which causes painful swellings under the ears, headaches, joint pain, and a high temperature. It usually takes between 16 and 18 days for the symptoms to develop and people are infectious between 2 days before and 4 days after the start of symptoms. It spreads from person to person in the same way as a cold -- through coughs, sneezes, and saliva.

It is important to protect teenagers and young adults who have not been vaccinated against the infection, which can develop into meningitis or other serious complications.

There was a similar outbreak in March 2010, when 41 students from Oxford University and 4 from Oxford Brookes University contracted the virus.

Students are being urged to have a 2nd dose of the MMR vaccine to ensure they are protected.

[The American College Health Association has recommended that colleges and universities require that students have documented receipt of 2 doses of measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine or have other acceptable evidence of measles, rubella, and mumps immunity before college enrolment (http://www.acha.org/topics/docs/CDC_ACHA_Mumps_Recommendations_Jul13.pdf).

Nevertheless, mumps outbreaks among vaccinated populations have been reported frequently during recent years, especially among college students, where the intensity of exposure among students presumably overcomes vaccine-induced immunity (http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/20/4/13-1681_article.htm). Perhaps waning post-vaccination immunity and antigenic differences between outbreak strains and the vaccine viruses are additional explanations for mumps outbreaks in highly vaccinated populations (http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/47/11/1458.full). However, the news report above fails to give us the mumps vaccination status of the affected students. - Mod.ML
