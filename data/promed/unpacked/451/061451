The appearance of as many as 4 suspected rabies cases among Bali's human population in 2014 means that Bali will fail to meet its target of being rabies-free by 2015. While Bali managed to go for almost a year without a new case of rabies among its human population, the recent re-emergence of rabies infections and at least 2 fatalities in Buleleng, North Bali, mean the earliest that Bali can now be free of the disease is 2016.

After decades of being rabies-free, the dreaded disease appeared again in Bali in 2008 and has claimed an estimated 147 victims since then. In 2014 there have already been 4 cases of suspected rabies among residents of Bali and a large number of confirmed cases in the canine populations.

Health authorities bemoan the low level of public understanding and cooperation in with the government in combating the disease, chiefly among villagers reluctant to have their animals vaccinated against rabies.

[This adds 2 more human cases since our previous report; see ProMED-mail archive no. 20140218.2285127. The pessimistic comment above by the Balinese Health authorities in this report, passing the blame for ineffective vaccination back to the public, suggests a lack of bureaucratic confidence. In this context, the remarks by Lisa Warden, director of DOGSTOP, are very relevant and to the point; see ProMED-mail archive no. 20131227.2139040.Thus the numbers of dogs diagnosed with rabies in Bali -- over 12 months in 2010, it varied from 10 to 65; only 6 in January 2011 but nothing for the rest of that year; for 6 months (June through December) in 2012, from 5 to 15 dogs; with no dogs for 2013 and 2014 -- is indicative of a severe ongoing problem even when one accepts that dead dogs were almost certainly ignored. Until they can get their canine vaccination act together, human rabies is going to continue to take a tragic and unnecessary toll.
