[2] China (Hong Kong): avian influenza H7N9 imported fatality
Date: 1 Mar 2015

The 3rd imported H7N9 case of the winter [2014-2015] in Hong Kong (and 13th overall) has reportedly died in a local hospital a week after his case was announced. Of the 2 other H7N9 cases imported into Hong Kong this season, one has recovered, while the other remains hospitalized in critical condition. [The individual who died is] a 61-year-old man [see ProMED mail post "Avian influenza, human (51): China (HK) H7N9 imported 20150223.3186193"].

Food and Health Secretary Ko Wing-man said most H7N9 cases in Hong Kong are imported from mainland China and appealed to the public to be alert [when traveling there]. Last month [February 2015], the patient traveled twice to Zhangmutou [in Dongguan, Guangdong] and went to the market to buy 2 chickens, which were slaughtered. After returning, he [became ill] and was admitted to Queen Mary Hospital intensive care unit, where he died this morning [1 Mar 2015]. ... - more

[The following comments are from Michael Coston of the Avian Flu Diary:
"Of the 602 H7N9 known cases reported by the World Health Organization as of 23 Feb 2015, 227 deaths have been reported, yielding a 37 percent fatality rate. But the real case fatality rate is likely far lower, as only the very sickest individuals are likely to be hospitalized, tested, and identified as [being infected with] the virus. And those people who are sick enough to be hospitalized are also more likely to succumb to the disease. If we could factor in the mild or moderate cases that never get counted but recover on their own, the high case fatality rate would probably drop precipitously. But even a 10-fold drop in mortality would leave us with a very daunting flu, comparable to the 1918 pandemic." - Mod.LK]

[3] China (Anhui): Avian influenza H7N9 CDC travel warning
Date: 28 Feb 2015
Source: The China Post [edited]
http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/national/national-news/2015/02/28/429905/CDC-warns.htm


The [Taiwan] Centers for Disease Control (CDC) raised its travel alert for Anhui to Level 2 on Fri [27 Feb 2015] after 2 new human infections of H7N9 avian influenza were reported [there]. Authorities confirmed that 2 men -- a 48-year-old in Maanshan City and a 75-year-old in Wuhu City -- have contracted the avian flu strain, the 1st H7N9 human infections in the province so far this year [2015]. Both cases were confirmed on 23 Feb [2015], and the men remain in critical condition, the CDC said [reported in ProMED-mail post "Avian influenza, human (57): China (GD,AH) H7N9 20150228.3199113"].

Level 2 alerts are also in place for Shanghai, Jiangsu and Zhejiang in eastern China; Fujian, Guangdong, Guizhou and Yunnan in the south and southwest; Jiangxi in northern China; and Xinjiang in the far west, the CDC said. All other mainland Chinese provinces and cities are under Level 1 advisories, it added.

Some 154 human infections of H7N9 have been reported in China since last October [2014], and the situation continues to worsen, the CDC said. Travelers to China should avoid contact with live or dead birds, pay attention to personal hygiene, and seek medical attention immediately if they develop symptoms such as a fever or a cough, CDC officials warned. Under the CDC's 3-tier system, a Level 1 travel warning urges vigilance and health precautions; Level 2 calls for a high degree of caution and strong protective measures; and Level 3 advises against travel to or from a specified destination.
