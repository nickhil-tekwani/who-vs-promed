Summary of the interview with Dr Mozart Cherubin (Hospital Director)
and Dr. Vilton, Beraca Hospital, Commune La Pointe, Port-de-Paix.
Interview held on 12 Jan 2011

- Cases presented to Baraca Hospital, Commune de La Pointe, Port-de-Paix

- Cases were 1st admitted to the CTC [cholera treatment center] for
cholera treatment.

- Cases 1-4 were in hypovolemic shock when admitted.

- During this interview they corrected previous version about
hospital discharge: only case 3 was discharged.

- For those who died, death certificates are not available [for us to
see] (They were not admitted to the CTC so the death registration is
in the main hospital and not the cholera [treatment center - CTC])

- All cases presented similar symptoms of paralysis within 72 hours
of recovery.

- Symptoms consisted of: ascending bilateral flaccid paralysis
leading to difficulty in speech, loss of consciousness and then
respiratory distress. Paralysis was highlighted in cases 2, 3 and 4,
while hypotony was the main symptom for cases 6 and 7.

- All cases were treated with ORS [oral rehydration salts], Ringers
lactate, dextrose 5 percent or saline solutions, and doxycycline
(oral) in adults; erythromycin (oral) in children. The severe cases
were also treated with ceftriaxone IV [intravenous] (this is sure for
case 3, but during the interview they said that 5 severe cases were
given ceftriaxone -- they could be cases 1,2,4, and 5). Case 5 was
also treated with dexamethasone. At some point during the interview
they mentioned the use of metroclopramide for cases with severe
vomiting, but denied its administration to these cases. No clinical
history available to check treatments. All this information was
provided orally.

- Medicines and RL, etc are provided by different organizations.
(MSPP/ PROMESS, MTI, MSH/USAID).

- All cases died except cases 4, 6 and 7.

- Both doctors said that they have never seen similar cases. For the
last 10 years, only 2 diagnoses of GBS [Guillain-Barre Syndrome] have
been made in this hospital (they were a 1 [year old] and a 4 [year old])

- Among the cases reported, cases 2, 3 and 4 cluster in time and seem
to fit the same clinical presentation. Case 1 may also belong to this
cluster but the reporting doctor was not sure. As for case 5,
reporting doctor was dubious. Cases 6 and 7 may be subject to recall
bias. They have heard about the 12 [year old] female transferred to
Charlotte (USA) but didn't know where she came from.

- They were questioned regarding particular diets or food that may
have been given to these cases. They discarded this possibility. They
mentioned fish (tetrodotoxin?) is not usually given to sick people.
There are no similar cases among family members. They were reluctant
to talk about traditional practices.

Case 1: Female. 5-6 years old. Died. Admitted at the beginning of
November [2010] to Beraca Hospital's CTC with cholera. Severe clinical
presentation. Recovered and was about to be discharged when she
started with asthenia, hypotonic in both legs which rapidly evolved
into an ascending, generalized flaccid paralysis, respiratory distress
and died within 24 hours. Address unknown: somewhere in Port de Paix
or Sant Louis du Nord. This case was notified retrospectively after
death.

Case 2: Male. 17 years old. Died. Admitted at the beginning of
December [2010] to Beraca Hospital's CTC with cholera. Also severe
clinical presentation. Recovered in 3-4 days, when he started with
hypotonic paralysis in both legs, which evolved in 24 hours to
paralysis of both arms, weak voice, severe dysarthria. Conscious until
death 48 hours after clinical presentation of paralysis. Date of
death: [13 Dec 2010]. Diagnosed as GBS. Address unknown: somewhere in
Lavaud. He was treated with IV [intravenous] potassium after paralysis
onset.

Case 3: Female. 36 years old. Died. She was a nurse/auxiliare working
at Beraca's CTC. She was admitted to the same CTC with cholera,
mid-December [2010]. Also severe clinical presentation. After
recovery, she was discharged (a Monday), went home and on Wednesday
afternoon couldn't move her legs. She was admitted to hospital on
Wednesday night (22 Dec 2010) with paralysis. She rapidly developed
ascending paralysis with difficult speech, respiratory distress, and
coma and died on Sun 26 Dec 2010. She had fever at the end and was
diagnosed of respiratory infection and treated with ceftriaxone IV. No
similar cases amongst family members. She has 3 children aged 15, 13,
12 [years old]. Stool samples from these children have been requested.
Address: La Pointe (nearby Beraca hospital).

Case 4: Male. 34 years old. Alive. Initially admitted for cholera at
Abricot CTC, 18 hours later [he] was admitted to Beraca CTC with
diarrhea and vomiting (on [27 Dec 2010]). Severe clinical presentation
with hypovolemic shock. Day before date of discharge, started with
pain in his legs (mainly in the left leg). The following day he
couldn't stand up and was completely paralyzed within hours.
Transferred to PaP on 02 Jan 2011(alive). Diagnosed as GBS. Address:
St Louis du Nord.

Case 5: Male. 85 years old. Died. Referred to Beraca hospital from
other health facility for cholera complications and flaccid paralysis.
Has been reported retrospectively after death (and during our
investigation).

Case 6: Male. 3 years old. Alive. Reported retrospectively during
interview. Admitted to Beraca hospital sometime during the 2nd-3rd
week of November [2010] with cholera. Presented generalized hypotony,
swollen abdomen (not sure at what moment, during or after the cholera
episode). Clinical symptoms lasted for 3-4 days. Was treated with
potassium and B complex with full recovery. Address: Port-de-Paix.

Case 7: Male. 6 years old. [Alive] Admitted last week of November/
beginning of December [2010] to Beraca Hospital's with hypothonia. Had
been treated for cholera in another CTC (Abricot?, Gaspin?) Recovered
in 72 hours. Address unknown.

Note: There is another case reported by informal sources (HEAS)
regarding a 12-year-old female transferred from PaP to Charlotte (USA)
with a similar clinical description (generalized flaccid paralysis,
respiratory distress). Her department of origin is unknown.

ACTIONS
A sampling kit with laboratory forms was left at the hospital.
- Doctors were requested to take samples from the 3 children of case 3.
- They were also requested to notify immediately to DSNO and
PAHO-alerts any incoming case of paralysis and to take samples.

[ProMED-mail originally decided to hold off posting this summary until
more information was available to permit a better definition of what
might be going on. This moderator just found a report on a newswire
stating that ProMED-mail had reported on an outbreak of polio in
Haiti. While the possibility of polio was discussed in the original
post and is still in the differential diagnosis, upon review of this
latest information, this moderator feels that more information was and
is still necessary before coming to any firm conclusions. Hence the
perceived need to post this information now and request further
clarification on what is going on.

As an aside, in prior presentations of clusters of acute flaccid
paralysis consistent with polio that ProMED-mail has covered, a
definitive diagnosis of polio was made within a few days following the
initial alert of the paralytic cases.

From the above descriptions of the clinical presentations, it appears
as though all patients thus far identified to have had an acute onset
of flaccid paralysis, had onset of their symptoms within a few days of
presenting to cholera treatment units for presumptive cholera [or
could it be a non-cholera gastroenteritis due to another organism such
as campylobacter or a viral agent such as an enterovirus?].
Unfortunately the above case descriptions do not provide information
on laboratory studies.

Reading through the descriptions of the cases one does wonder what
might be triggering a Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS)-like illness. But,
that being said, a review of the literature did not reveal much
identifying a strong association of GBS with cholera. But, GBS post
antigen exposure (respiratory and gastrointestinal infections,
vaccinations) usually occurs with an interval of 2-3 weeks following
the original antigenic exposure (see Schonberger LB, Bregman DJ,
Sullivan-Bolyai JZ, Keenlyside RA, Ziegler DW, Retailliau HF, Eddins
DL, Bryan JA. Guillain-Barre syndrome following vaccination in the
National Influenza Immunization Program, United States, 1976--1977. Am
J Epidemiol. 1979 Aug;110(2):105-23.).

Another "hallmark" of GBS is a strong sensory component, and the above
descriptions do no mention a sensory component as part of the clinical
picture.

Hence, at present, given the limited information available, drawing a
conclusion as to the etiology of the above described paralytic cases
at this point in time is premature and risky. None of the diagnoses
speculated have been either ruled in or ruled out as yet.

This moderator would like to repeat the request for more information
from knowledgeable sources in the Region.
