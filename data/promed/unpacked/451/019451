The investigative department of the Russian Federation in Sverdlovsk region initiated an investigation in connection with the death of a 7 year old boy from meningococcal infection. In the early morning of 17 Apr 2013, a child with a high temperature was admitted to the hospital in Pervouralsk; however, the attempts to save him failed.

The investigation determined that on 16 Apr 2013, the boy as usual came back from the kindergarten home at 1700, but in the morning of 17 Apr 2013, his temperature was very high. His mother called an ambulance, which rapidly brought the child to the infectious diseases unit of the city hospital for emergency medical assistance, but the child died. The medical examiner determined that the cause of death of the preschooler was meningococcal infection.

At present, an investigation has been initiated to establish all the circumstances of the accident. Medical workers of the hospital and ambulance staff, as well as relatives of the dead boy, were interviewed.

Alexander Shulga, the official representative of emergency situations of The Russian Federation for Sverdlovsk Region said that a court of inquiry is scheduled to establish the exact cause of death. After the results of the autopsy, the investigation will be finished, and a decision will be made.

[Pervouralsk, with a population of 124 528 (2010 census), is a city in the Sverdlovsk Oblast located 24 miles (39 km) west of Yekaterinburg, the administrative center of Sverlovsk Oblast (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pervouralsk). Sverdlovsk Oblast is located mostly on the eastern slopes of the Middle and North Urals and the Western Siberian Plain, in the Urals Federal District. - Mod.ML

This is the 5th ProMED-RUS posting of meningococcal disease in less than 4 months in Russia. A rise in the incidence of this disease has been noted in several regions: in the Penza region, 11 cases were diagnosed in 2 months (an increase of 56 per cent compared with the previous year); in the Nizhny Novgorod region, 5 cases were diagnosed in 3 months; an increase in numbers of cases has also been observed in the Yaroslavl region and in the Perm region - Mod.NP]

A fatal case of meningococcal infection in a 15 year old schoolgirl was reported in Angarsk in the Irkutsk region on Wednesday [24 Apr 2013] by the press service of the city administration.

"The girl fell ill on 18 Apr 2013. Her symptoms were consistent with acute respiratory infection: she had a temperature of 37 C [98.6 F] and a headache. The parents of the girl sought medical assistance on Sun 21 Apr 2013 when she developed a rash and her temperature had risen to 39 C [102.2]," according to the press service. The girl was placed in the intensive care unit, but attempts to save her failed. The press service said: "The disease developed fast and led to death."

At the present time, countermeasures have been taken in the girl's home and at her school. In her classroom, a quarantine was introduced. Tests were done on her contacts among classmates, teachers, and relatives. The test results will be known at the beginning of next week.

"Symptoms of the disease in her close contacts have not been observed," says the press-service. In 2012, one lethal case [of meningococcal disease] was reported.

[Angarsk, with a population of 233 567 (2010 census), is a city in Irkutsk Oblast, Russia located 3200 miles (5150 km) east of Moscow (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angarsk). Irkutsk Oblast is located in southeastern Siberia. - Mod.ML

Cases of meningococcal infection are registered annually in the Irkutsk region. In 2012, 20 cases of this disease were registered in the region. - Corr.BA

Although not mentioned in the above news report, antibiotics are recommended to prevent secondary infection in close contacts of patients with invasive meningococcal disease. These at-risk contacts include household members, roommates, attendees at the same child care center, or anyone directly exposed to the patient's oral secretions through close social contact during the 7 days before onset of disease in the index case, such as through kissing, mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, or endotracheal intubation.

Because the risk for illness in contacts is highest during the 1st few days after infection, chemoprophylaxis should be administered as soon as possible (ideally within 24 hours) after contact with an index case-patient. Chemoprophylaxis administered after 14 days is probably of limited or no value (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/pdf/rr/rr4605.pdf). Antibiotics that effectively eliminate nasopharyngeal carriage of _Neisseria meningitidis_ include rifampin, ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone, and azithromycin, and these drugs are appropriate for chemoprophylaxis. In areas of the United States where ciprofloxacin-resistant strains of _N. meningitidis_ have been detected, ciprofloxacin should not be used for chemoprophylaxis (http://www.cdc.gov/MMWR/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5707a2.htm and http://www.unboundmedicine.com/redbook/ub/view/RedBook/187078/7/meningococcal_vaccine_for).

We are not told in the 2nd news report above what tests are being done on the index patient's close contacts. However, close contacts of patients with invasive meningococcal disease are at high risk and should receive chemoprophylaxis. For example, the attack rate for household contacts is 500 to 800 times the rate for the general population. The decision to give chemoprophylaxis to contacts of people with meningococcal disease is based on risk of contracting invasive disease. Neither oropharyngeal nor nasopharyngeal cultures for _N. meningitidis_ are useful in deciding who should receive chemoprophylaxis (http://www.unboundmedicine.com/redbook/ub/view/RedBook/187078/7/meningococcal_vaccine_for and CDC.
