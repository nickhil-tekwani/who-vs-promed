[ProMED-mail has been alerted by Ronan Kelley of FluTrackers of an increase in reports of "viral fever" in Tamil Nadu state that are appearing in the local language press in India. Machine translations were provided. The stories to date appear very disjointed and deal primarily with individual case discussions and do not present a cohesive picture of what may be going on. Given the information we presently have on the increase in dengue activity in Tamil Nadu (see reports above), one wonders if these "viral fever" reports may relate to the increase in dengue activity. We await further clarification of the situation. - Mod.MPP]
