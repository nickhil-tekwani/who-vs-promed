Encephalitis kills 10 people in Northern India
----------------------------------------------
LUCKNOW: Encephalitis has killed 10 people in the north Indian state of
Uttar Pradesh in the last two days and a dozen patients are being treated,
doctors said on Monday. V.P. Gupta, chief medical superintendent at a local
hospital, said all the victims were from villages in the Bahraich district
which lies near the border with Nepal. "About a dozen more such patients
are currently being treated in the hospital. Most of them are in a critical
condition, but we're trying to do our best to fight the disease," Gupta
told Reuters by telephone. Outbreaks of encephalitis, or swelling of the
brain, are an annual feature in the mosquito-infested region on the Uttar
Pradesh-Nepal border.

[Further information on the etiology of this outbreak of encephalitis is
awaited. It is likely that Japanese encephalitis virus is the agent
responsible for this outbreak. Japanese Encephalitis virus-induced disease
was first identified in 1978 in the Ganges plain, in the region of the
Nepalese Terai, along the border between Nepal and India. Since then annual
epidemics of varying sizes have been recorded in Nepal and adjacent regions
of India during the rainy season. The largest number of reported cases was
2953 in 1997. In 1999 the epidemic began about two weeks early (in early
July) due probably to early onset of to the monsoon rains. By the end of
August there had been more that 1100 cases and over 170 deaths had been
reported in the Terai region of Nepal. In past years there have been
sporadic localized immunization campaigns, using the killed Biken mouse
brain vaccine, carried out by international charitable organizations, but
the follow-up has been erratic. - Mod.CP
