Chikungunya disease has infected thousands of people in Bandarlampung
over the last month [December 2007].
In the worst hit area, Waydadi subdistrict in Sukarame, the
mosquito-borne disease has struck 500 or so residents in 3
neighborhood units.
Of the residents in our neighborhood, 90 percent have been infected
by chikungunya [virus]. There are 94 families in our neighborhood,
and in each family, 2-3 members have been infected by the disease. My
wife and I also caught it," said RT 13 neighborhood unit chief in
Waydadi, on Thursday [27 Dec 2007].
The infection rate is similarly high in the RT 10 and RT 12
neighborhood units.
The neighborhood chief said he had reported the rampant disease to
the subdistrict and district chiefs 4 weeks ago, but had yet to
receive a reply.
Waydadi district chief Amil Riadi said he was unaware that residents
were infected with chikungunya [virus]. "There were no reports from
the subdistrict office or community health centers," said Amil.
The disease spread to a number of districts in Bandarlampung starting
in November [2007], as rainy season approached. Aside from Sukarame
district, the disease has also infected residents in North and South
Telukbetung, Kemiling, Sukaraja, Panjang, and Kedaton districts.
Bandarlampung Health Office deputy head Tri Henny Sukemi said her
office was coordinating with the provincial health office to carry
out a fumigation drive in a number of subdistricts deemed rife with
the disease.
The coordinator of the Coalition for a Healthy Lampung (KULS),
Herdimansyah, said provincial and city health officials had been
sluggish in responding to the outbreak.
"The number of patients has climbed into the thousands, but there is
not yet any concrete action. The disease in Lampung can be
categorized as an extraordinary case now due to its vast spread and
the huge number of those affected," he said.
Herdimansyah added that the disease had also infected residents in a
number of regencies in Lampung, such as Tanggamus and South Lampung.
He said no fatalities had been reported so far in Lampung, but said
the disease was very harmful due to its impact on people's
productivity.
"Those affected by the disease obviously cannot go to work for at
least a week. It might not matter if they were civil servants or
private sector employees because they would still get paid, but what
about the poor people who work as laborers? They cannot earn a living
if they're sick," said Herdimansyah.
He added the number of sufferers in Lampung might be more than 1000
because community health centers and doctors treating patients
generally do not report cases to the health office.
"Many sufferers also do not seek treatment because they cannot afford
to," he said.
Bandarlampung Health Office head Reihana said a number of
subdistricts in the city were believed to be the breeding grounds of
_Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes, the carrier of the disease, due to an
unclean environment and poor sanitary habits. "These mosquitoes like
these places to breed," he said.
Chikungunya, which [was 1st identified] on the African continent, was 1st
detected in Indonesia in 1973. The 1st cases were reported in
Samarinda, East Kalimantan. The disease then spread to Kuala Tungkal,
Martapura, Ternate, and Yogyakarta, and later reached other areas
across the country.

[This substantial outbreak illustrates the difficulty in achieving
timely case reporting in a developing country that has limited
resources and occupies a large geographic area.
