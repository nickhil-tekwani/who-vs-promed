The recent appearance of [FMDV serotype] Asia 1 in Bahrain and Iran
in 2011 has been linked to viruses from Pakistan. The genotyping
report of the Iranian strain is available at
http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/2011/WRLFMD-2011-00020%20Asia1%20Iran%202011.pdf.

[The circulation of FMDV Asia 1 in Iran is of significance for other
countries in the Middle East and beyond. According to the Iran page of
the WRLFMD, this serotype had been reported from Iran in the years
1957, 1964, 1973, 1999, 2001, and 2004. In Turkey, it was last
recorded in 1973 and 1999-2000. The last detection of FMDV Asia 1 in
Israel was in 1989 (on the Lebanese frontier).

The earliest record of Asia 1 in the Middle East is in 1957, when
outbreaks were observed in Israel and Iran. The virus spread
throughout the entire Middle East, reaching Turkey in the north. In
1973, the threat of Asia 1 to Europe led to the inclusion of vaccine
against Asia 1 in the buffer zone in Thrace. Asia 1 eventually spread
to Europe, where a single outbreak occurred in Greece near the Turkish
border in 1984.

Please refer also to "FMDV type Asia 1 in Pakistan and Bahrain
presents a threat to Western Eurasia/Middle East"
(http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_alerts/asia_1_2011.htm).

Veterinary authorities in relevant countries may consider notifying
the OIE about the recurrence of FMDV Asia 1, in line with the
stipulations in Article 1.1.3. of the International Terrestrial Animal
Health Code. - Mod.AS]
