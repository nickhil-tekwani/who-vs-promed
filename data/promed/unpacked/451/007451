Avian influenza situation in Egypt - update 55
----------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health of Egypt has notified WHO of one case of human
infection with avian influenza A (H5N1) virus.

The case is a 6 year old girl from Demnhoor district [Damanhur],
Beheira governorate. She developed symptoms on 12 Jul 2011, and was
hospitalized. She completed the course of oseltamivir, recovered, and
was discharged on 30 Jul 2011.

Investigations into the source of infection indicate that the case had
exposure to poultry suspected to have avian influenza. The case was
confirmed by the Egyptian Central Public Health Laboratories, a
National Influenza Center of the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance
Network.

Of the 151 cases confirmed to date in Egypt, 52 have been fatal.
