A national recall of flour due to _Escherichia coli_ [O121] contamination, which was 1st announced in March 2017 and is the subject of a class-action lawsuit, is being expanded to cover additional products.

The Canadian Food Inspection Agency's (CFIA) recall on [Tue 28 Mar 2017] affected Robin Hood flour sold in 4 provinces in Western Canada and was later expanded across the country. The recall now covers products produced by Ardent Mills of Brampton. They include one-kilogram [2.2 pounds] bags of Brodie self-raising cake and pastry flour; Creative Baker all-purpose flour in 20-kilogram [44.09 pounds] bags; Creative Baker whole wheat flour in 10-kilogram [22.04 pounds] packages; and Golden Temple Sooji creamy wheat in 2-kilogram[4.4 pounds] packages - each with various best-before dates. The initial recall affected Robin Hood flour in 10-kilogram bags but the CFIA said the recall now includes Robin Hood flour in one-kilogram bags with best-before dates of 14, 15, and 18 Apr, 2018.

The CFIA said all recalled products should be thrown out or returned to the store. The agency said after the initial recall there had been 26 cases of people being infected with _E. coli_ in British Columbia, Saskatchewan, Alberta and Newfoundland and Labrador. No deaths have been reported, but at least 6 people have required hospital care. The CFIA said there are no reported illnesses associated with the products added to the expanded recall.
