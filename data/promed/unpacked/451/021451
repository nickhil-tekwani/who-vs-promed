Japan. 26 Sep 2014. Dengue fever cases 144, almost doubling in the past 2 and a half weeks, while one more park in Tokyo is believed to be another locality, Japan's Health Ministry said Friday [26 Sep 2014].

The 1st cases of dengue fever were registered in Japan in late August 2014 for the 1st time in 70 years. Due to the spread of the disease, Tokyo's authorities have been undertaking disinfection works, closing the popular Yoyogi Park and Shinjuku Central Park. Restrictions have also been placed on visits to Aoyama Park, Sotobori Park and Meiji Jingu Gaien Parks. According to the NHK television channel, one more park, Nakameguro, located in the Meguro district near numerous embassies, was added to the list after a 30-year-old man who recently visited the park was diagnosed with dengue fever. A new case of the disease is now suspected in Sumida City after a woman bitten by a mosquito at Sumida Park started showing symptoms of dengue fever last week.
