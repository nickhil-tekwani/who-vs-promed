Anthrax outbreak hits Mhondoro
------------------------------
An anthrax outbreak has hit parts of Mhondoro once again, prompting
the Ministry of Health and Child Welfare to suspend the sale of meat,
particularly beef, in the area. There have been moves to raise
awareness on preventive measures and also calls to avoid slaughtering
beasts until the situation is brought under control. So far, only one
human case has been detected and authorities are still monitoring the
situation to establish if there are more cases.

Mashonaland West provincial medical director Dr. Wenceslas Nyamayaro
urged people in the affected areas to exercise caution. "We have one
confirmed case of anthrax in Chegutu district and our teams are still
carrying out investigations to make sure that the disease does not
spread. The situation is under control," he said.

Dr. Nyamayaro said anthrax was endemic in the area but warned people
to avoid slaughtering cattle -- even those which looked healthy --
until they had been given the green light by health officials. "We
are not really surprised because temperatures are picking up now as
we enter into the summer season. People are now burning grass and
animals tend to eat grass to the root, bringing them into contact
with anthrax spores," he said.

Anthrax spores can lie dormant for up to 10 years until they get into
contact with a host. Anthrax is endemic in the belt just to the west
of the central watershed following spore seeding by Rhodesian
intelligence agents in the last years of the liberation war.

On Tuesday [23 Sep 2008] most people had taken heed of the warning by
health officials not to slaughter beasts and consume the meat.
Butcheries at Mubaira Growth Point had stopped selling meat while
restaurants were offering alternative dishes in compliance with the
order. "I have just got meat from the Nyamweda area because there is
none here," said a woman, who did not want to be identified. The
situation was the same at Rwizi Business Centre. At Kadhani Service
Centre, butcheries and other retail outlets were selling poultry only.

A wide cross-section of people interviewed demonstrated awareness
about the outbreak and precautionary measures they were required to take.

[It is clear from what is not said in this report that in the
Zimbabwean severe financial stress and hyperinflation the veterinary
service is inactive in Mashonaland West and livestock in a known
enzootic region are not being vaccinated. This will continue until
the economy can begin to recover and the veterinary service gets
their act together. If there is no money for transport, vaccines,
fuel, personnel, there is very little one can do.

The claims of Rhodesian BW [biowarfare] activities in the late '70s
are often made but with little evidence to support them. What is
clear is that until the civil war anthrax was very well controlled
throughout the country with minimal livestock and human cases. Then
the insurgents began shooting the rural Veterinary Assistants, who
became understandably reluctant to go out and vaccinate village
livestock. With the onset of heavier than normal rains in 1978
anthrax reached epidemic proportions. Because of rural malnutrition
sick animals were slaughtered and butchered with all the usual results.

In its day their veterinary service was one of the most effective in Africa.
