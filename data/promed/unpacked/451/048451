In a follow-up on the chikungunya outbreak in Kassala state, Sudan, government officials in Kassala report an increase in cases of 23 percent in a week, according to a local media account.

Kassala state government reported one week ago that 10 900 people were infected in the state during the past weeks. The most recent tally puts the case count at 13 400.

Reports on social media put the death toll at 150; however, these numbers are unverified.

Chikungunya virus [CHIKV] is transmitted by the bite of _Aedes_ mosquitoes, particularly _A. aegypti_ and _A. albopictus_. In humans bitten by an infected mosquito, the disease symptoms usually appear after an incubation period of 3-7 days (range 1-12 days).

CHIKV can cause acute, sub-acute, and chronic disease.

In acute disease, symptoms develop abruptly and include high fever, headache, myalgia, and arthralgia (predominantly in limbs and large joints). The appearance of a maculopapular rash is also frequent. Severe forms of the disease are rare. Symptoms usually resolve in 7-10 days, although arthralgia and joint stiffness may persist intermittently for several months.

The disease shares some clinical signs with dengue and Zika, and can be misdiagnosed in areas where they are common. As there is no cure, treatment is focused on relieving the symptoms.

[This outbreak is ongoing in Kassala state. The report above does not indicate if any or all of these 13 400 cases in the state are laboratory confirmed. A 30 Sep 2018 WHO report stated that there were a total of 13 430 suspected cases in the country, primarily from Kassala and Red Sea states. An unstated number of samples have been tested both by PCR and by serology. A number of samples have also been tested positive for dengue fever (see Chikungunya (06): Africa (Sudan) mixed outbreak 20181008.6078917), although the report above only mentions chikungunya as the causal virus involved. The 30 Sep 2018 report does not indicate how many of the total cases were due to dengue. - Mod.TY
