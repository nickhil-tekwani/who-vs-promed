Outbreak of rare disease kills two
----------------------------------
An outbreak of a rare disease that causes its victims to bleed and can kill
within 2 weeks has infected 3 people and killed 2 others in the western
province of Herat. The disease called Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever
(CCHF), has never been recorded in Afghanistan, according to the World
Health Organization's (WHO) website. Doctors in Herat warned that the
disease, which is transmitted from animals to humans through ticks, will
spread to other parts of the country unless preventative steps are taken
immediately.

Victims have a 30 per cent chance of dying within the second week of the
disease once infected, WHO says. Sudden fever, aching muscles, dizziness,
neck pain, backache, headache, sore eyes, and photophobia (sensitivity to
light) are early symptoms of CCHF. These are followed by a fast heart rate,
a rash that causes the skin to bleed, bleeding from the upper bowel, blood
in the urine, nosebleeds, and gum bleeding.

Head of the regional hospital in Herat said nine potential victims of the
disease had come into hospital for treatment, but only 5 of them had tested
positive for CCHF so far. Two of the 5 infected with the disease have died.

Infection can be prevented by using repellents on the skin and clothing and
by wearing gloves or other protective clothing to prevent skin contact with
infected tissue or blood. Doctors in Herat sent blood samples to the UN's
medical centre in Egypt to find out if the patients had the disease - 5
tested positive. The results of 4 other potential victims are still pending.

Butchers, shepherds, and others who have daily contact with animals are
more likely to be infected with the disease. The disease is endemic in many
countries in Africa, Europe, and Asia. The disease was first described in
the Crimea in 1944.

ProMED-mail rapporteur A-Lan Banks

[Although this report states that these are the first reported cases of
CCHF in Afghanistan, ProMED-mail posted a report in 2002 (see:
Crimean-Congo hem. fever - Iran ex Afghanistan 20020607.4430) that 5
residents of Afghanistan were treated for suspected CCHF in a hospital in
Iran close to the Afghan border. Three of the patients died. CCHD is
endemic in countries bordering Afghanistan, Iran, and Pakistan in
particular, therefore it would seem unlikely that Afghanistan is a
CCHD-free country.

For further information on CCHF a WHO fact-file is available at
<http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs208/en/>.
