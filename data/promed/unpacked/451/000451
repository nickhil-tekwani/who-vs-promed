Asprolaval coordinates campaign in 5 municipalities
----------------------------------------------------
BAILADORES: Eudes Arellano, president of the Association of Dairy Farmers
of the High Valleys (Asprolaval), based in Bailadores, informed that this
organization is responsible for the coordination of the transportation of
animal products and byproducts, as well as for the foot and mouth disease
(FMD) eradication campaign in 5 municipalities (Tovar, Zea, Antonio Pinto
Salinas, Guaraque, and Rivas Davila), along the Mocoties river, in the
state of Merida.
Arellano also informed that due to the confirmation of an outbreak of FMD
in the locality of Arapuey, the Autonomous Service of Plant Protection and
Animal Health (SASA), decided to cancel the 2003 Bailadores Agricultural
Fair and, thus, the movement of animals among municipalities, with the
exception of those being transported to slaughterhouses.
This measure was adopted in view of the fact that the animals transported
to the fairgrounds in Bailadores would pose a serious risk to the cattle
industry in the municipality of Rivas Davila.
More than 19 000 heads of cattle were vaccinated, representing 91 per cent
of the animal population (more than 20 000 heads of cattle) in the 5
municipalities involved. Arellano explained that efforts had been made to
achieve 100 per cent vaccination but that it was not easy, especially in a
locality with so many limitations, involving mountainous terrain and the
need to round up and vaccinate animals individually. He added that they,
the farmers, are the most interested in the successful eradication of FMD.
