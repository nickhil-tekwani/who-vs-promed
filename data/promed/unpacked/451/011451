Common source suggested for the H5N1 viruses
--------------------------------------------
[Referring to Moderator CP's comment: "The current issue of the
Journal of Virology contains a paper by Doan C. Nguyen and 20 others
entitled: "Isolation and Characterization of Avian Influenza Viruses,
Including Highly Pathogenic H5N1, from Poultry in Live Bird Markets
in Hanoi, Vietnam, in 2001," which suggests a common source for the
H5N1 viruses circulating in East Asia].
This makes eminent sense to me.
A very crude plotting of HPAI H5N1 outbreaks on a map of Indochina
shows a nice progression of dates beginning in the mountains
bordering Thailand and Laos and following the Mekong and Mae Nam Chao
Phraya waterways. There does seem to be a nidus in the mountains, but
my personal bias (pirate ancestors!) leads me to wonder whether there
is a handy mountain pass at 100 degrees E and 20 degrees N through which
poultry might be smuggled.
