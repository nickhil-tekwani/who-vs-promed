Report flags bacterial blight
-----------------------------
A number of reports of bacterial blight in oats around agricultural Manitoba were featured in the provincial agriculture department's latest insect and disease report. Symptoms include light green to water-soaked spots or stripes on the leaves.

John Gavloski of Manitoba Agriculture, Food and Rural Initiatives says bacterial blight [is favoured by] humid, wet weather and recent warm, dry weather should halt further development. "It is important to note that this disease is caused by a bacterium, not a fungus, and therefore fungicide applications will not provide any control."

[Two bacterial blights of oat are known: halo blight caused by _Pseudomonas syringae_ pv. _coronafaciens_ and stripe blight caused by the closely related _P. syringae_ pv. _striafaciens_. While they are often considered minor diseases of the crop, they may be widespread early in the season and outbreaks can occur under favourable humid conditions.

Symptoms appear primarily on leaves, but may also affect leaf sheaths and chaff. Halo blight symptoms include light green water-soaked oval spots surrounded by a pale green margin ('halo') which eventually turn into brown blotches; stripe blight symptoms appear as light green spots without halo and lesions lengthen forming water-soaked brown stripes. Lesions produced by both halo and stripe blights often join together to produce large irregular blotches. In both cases, the heavily infected leaves soon turn necrotic and wither making it difficult to distinguish the 2 diseases.

The pathogens are spread by water, wind, mechanical means (including animal and human activities, leaf-to-leaf contact), and infected plant materials (including seeds, crop debris). Disease management usually includes cultural practices (such as ploughing or grazing crops to remove sources of infection), crop rotation, phytosanitation to prevent spread (for example, disinfection of farm machinery), and use of certified clean planting material. Chemical control (copper compounds, antibiotics) may be effective on _P. s._ pathovars but are hardly feasible for broadacre crops such as cereals.

Other pathovars in the _P. syringae_ group can affect a wide variety of plants, including many crops. Varieties with different levels of resistance are available for some crops, but new diseases and strains are emerging frequently.
