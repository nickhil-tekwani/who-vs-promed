Since early [November 2016], the number of laboratory-confirmed norovirus infections reported in Germany has been increasing steeply. Here, we report the detection and genetic characterization of an emerging norovirus recombinant, GII.P16-GII.2. This strain was frequently identified as the cause of sporadic cases as well as outbreaks in 9 federal states of Germany. Our findings suggest that the emergence of GII.P16-GII.2 contributed to rising case numbers of norovirus gastroenteritis in Germany.

In 2016, the increase of notified norovirus cases in the winter season was unexpectedly strong and early (Figure 1) in Germany. In [November 2016], 14 872 laboratory-confirmed cases were reported to the national public health authority compared with a median of 7810 cases in the same month of the previous 5 years. This may be due to a new variant's ability to escape herd immunity to the previously circulating strains. In this study, we conducted a phylogenetic analysis of the currently circulating norovirus strains in order to assess whether one or several new strains could be responsible for the current steep rise in norovirus cases.

Discussion
----------

We found a new norovirus strain GII.P16-GII.2 in samples from sporadic AGE [acute gastroenteritis] and from norovirus outbreaks derived from 9 federal states of Germany. It was recently shown that the emergence of new GII.4 norovirus variants can result in an increasing number of reported norovirus infection [5]. This has already been observed in Germany in the season 2007-08 which was also characterized by an early rise and high total number of notified norovirus infections, with most of the analyzed outbreaks caused by the new epidemic variant GII.4 2006b [7]. Another example is the emergence of a novel variant GII.P17-GII.17 in the season 2014-15, which was 1st genotyped in China and Japan and replaced the previously dominant genotype GII.Pe-GII.4 2012 with an increased outbreak activity [8.9]. The new 2016 GII.P16-GII.2 recombinant has sporadically been reported to the international molecular surveillance database Noro Net from Australia, Finland, France and Russia, and previously from Japan and China [10.11], suggesting a worldwide distribution.

So far, it is unclear whether the new recombinant is associated with more severe symptoms. Further molecular and epidemiological investigations are needed to assess whether the emerging new recombinant norovirus strain GII.P16-GII.2 can replace the predominant GII.Pe-GII.4 2012 strain and how this will affect outbreak sizes, course of disease and herd immunity of the population, not only in Germany but also in other countries in Europe.

Norovirus is the leading cause of gastroenteritis outbreaks worldwide. The most common norovirus strain (genogroup II genotype 4) is a major cause of these outbreaks. New norovirus strains emerge about every 2 to 4 years. Often, but not always, these new strains lead to an increase in outbreaks. This article reports a new norovirus strain, GII.P16-GII.2, associated with recent outbreaks in Germany as well as outbreaks elsewhere globally.

More patients have been struck down with vomiting bug norovirus this year [2016] compared with the previous 5 years, according to official figures.

Data from Public Health England shows reports of the bug had reached 2435 this winter [2016-2017] - 12 percent more than the average for the same period over the last 5 years. The figure is also 71 percent higher than the same period last year [2015], although last winter had unusually low levels of norovirus.

In the week ending on Christmas Day [Sun 25 Dec 2016], the outbreaks of vomiting and diarrhoea resulted in more bed closures than during the same period last year [2015] - rising from an average of 559 beds closed per day to 699. Hospitals reported 20 outbreaks of norovirus in the first 2 weeks of December [2016], 17 of which led to bay or ward closures and 13 of which were confirmed as the bug.

In total so far this season, there have been 163 hospital outbreaks reported.

Nick Phin, deputy director of the national infection service at PHE, said: "Norovirus is a common cause of illness during winter. Exactly when the peak in activity occurs will be different each winter but levels seen so far this year [2016] are not unexpected compared with the previous 5 years."

The number of laboratory reports of the bug rotavirus this season is 1136, which is also 3 percent higher than the average for the period from 2003 to 2013.

In early November [2016] the Mexican restaurant chain Wahaca closed several branches in London after more than 350 customers and staff fell ill with suspected norovirus. PHE and environmental health officers were called in after the suspected outbreak of the winter vomiting bug struck at 9 restaurants.

Norovirus is estimated to be the most common cause of acute gastroenteritis globally. It is responsible for 685 million cases every year, 200 million of these cases are among children younger than 5 years old. This leads to an estimated 50 000 child deaths every year, nearly all of which occur in developing countries. However, norovirus is a problem in both low and high income countries.

Each year on average in the United States, norovirus causes 19-21 million cases of acute gastroenteritis. It leads to 1.7-1.9 million outpatient visits and 400 000 emergency department visits, primarily in young children, and it contributes to about 56 000-71 000 hospitalizations and 570-800 deaths, mostly among young children and the elderly.

CDC established the Norovirus Sentinel Testing and Tracking (NoroSTAT) network in August 2012. NoroSTAT is a collaborative network of 9 state health departments and CDC working together to establish and maintain standard practices for norovirus outbreak reporting to CDC surveillance systems (https://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/reporting/norostat/index.html).

There also is an international molecular surveillance database, NoroNet, an informal network of scientists working in public health institutes or universities sharing virological, epidemiological and molecular data on norovirus (http://www.rivm.nl/en/Topics/N/NoroNet). - Mod.LK
