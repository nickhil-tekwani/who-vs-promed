According to top officials of the Disease Investigation Laboratory, Directorate of Veterinary and Animal Husbandry, Manipur, brain samples collected from 3 dogs which had bitten people to death and one which died with symptoms of rabies without biting anyone were sent to the Veterinary College at Hebbal in Karnataka for testing on 5 Jan 2015. Out of these 4 brain samples, 3 have been confirmed with rabies.

Of the positive brain samples, one each had been collected from Khannarok and Kiyamgei in Imphal East district and the other from Maokot village in Churachandpur district.

The dog from Maokot was one year old, and it had shown symptoms of rabies after [being] bitten by other suspected rabid dogs. The dog from Khannarok was around 10 months old; it died after biting a young boy, while the dog from Kiyamgei was around 4 months old, and it had started showing symptoms of rabies infection.

The test result of the brain sample collected from a dog in Mayang Imphal under Imphal West district, however, turned out to be negative for rabies.

The officials further disclosed that 5 other brain samples of dogs had already been sent for testing to the Veterinary College at Hebbal some days earlier, and arrangements were being made for sending 3 more samples in the next couple of days.

Meanwhile, mass vaccination programmes are being conducted by the Veterinary Department in collaboration with local clubs and organisations to contain the outbreak of rabies in different parts of the state.
