A man from the city of Thatta in Sindh province, Pakistan died from rabies after a dog bite due to the local hospital not having rabies post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP).

The victim was reportedly attacked by a rabid dog around a week ago and suffered injuries on the head and torso.

Relatives took him to the local civil hospital only to find anti-rabies vaccine was not available.

Doctors there recommended the family take him to a private hospital; however, they could not afford the cost of his treatment at a private hospital. He died soon after.

In the wake of the incident, members of civil society lambasted the administration of Municipal Committee Thatta over its failure to rid the town of rabid dogs despite court orders. They said that dog-bite cases were increasing across the district but that the authorities concerned were not taking measures against them. They also said that the MERF administration was not addressing the issues of dog bite victims. They have urged authorities concerned to take notice of this issue.

According to the Global Alliance for Rabies Control, once the clinical onset of rabies is evident, there is no cure available, and death is inevitable. It is, therefore, extremely important to get prompt medical treatment.

Full PEP consists of thorough washing of the wound, followed by immunoglobulin injections (antibodies against the rabies virus) into the wound and a series of rabies vaccinations that are administered after an exposure occurs to prevent disease progression. If the bite victim has never been immunized for rabies, they should always receive the vaccination and the immunoglobulin treatment. Victims who were vaccinated with a modern rabies vaccine prior to exposure will still need booster doses of vaccine. They will not need immunoglobulin injections.

["The poorest and most marginalized are most at rabies risk; many die due to high treatment costs or lack of access to post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP)." This is one of the statements included in the technical document: "United Against Rabies Forum: Zero by 30: One Health in Action," published cooperatively by the FAO, OIE and WHO on 3 Mar 2021. The above report from Pakistan demonstrates its veracity. The published "Global Strategic Plan to End Human Deaths from Dog-Mediated Rabies by 2030" includes the following key elements: improved access to PEP, especially for the poorest; mass-dog vaccination; improved disease reporting and surveillance tools; community education and outreach (available at https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-UCN-NTD-VVE-2021.1). - Mod.AS]

[The above circular has been distributed by email to all relevant veterinarians and the regional Veterinary Offices.

For the location of the village Beit Jann, upper Galilee, Hazafon (northern) district, 8 km from the Lebanese border, see map at https://tinyurl.com/2vdcktev. This dog is the 4th confirmed as rabid in this village since 4 Apr 2021. Information on their vaccination history and the number of people requiring post exposure prophylaxis (PEP) treatment will be useful.

The accumulated number of lab-confirmed rabies cases in animals in Israel since the start of 2021 is 21, all presented on a dynamic map available at https://moag.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=bbf64c46134b4772bb2bc9d6bb7c1290. They include 17 dogs, 3 jackals, and one lamb. Of the 17 dogs, 15 were located in the northern (Hazafon) district, along the borders with Lebanon and Syria, while 2 rabid dogs were located more than 210 km southwards, in the arid Arava plain, south of the Dead Sea, Southern (Hadarom) district, on Israel's border with Jordan (see in the above map). These 2 dogs tested rabies positive on 21 Jan 2021 (Ketura) and 22 Feb 2021 (Ein Tamar). Their detection may be indicative of rabies circulating also in the Jordanian side of the Arava plain.

The incidence of dog rabies has, during 2021, increased compared to previous years in spite of the compulsory official annual vaccination policy in owned dogs and the application of periodical countrywide oral vaccination of wildlife (jackals and foxes). To the best of our knowledge, the affected dogs were strays or unvaccinated owned dogs.

The following totals of the annual numbers of dog rabies cases have been reported in Israel since 2010: 23, 10, 12, 17, 3, 12, 12, 10, 6, 10, 15, and, in 2021 (as of 19 Apr 2021, during less than 4 months), 17. Clarification of the rise in dog rabies will be helpful.

The last human rabies case in Israel was reported in 2003. A recent media report (published as a suspected case in https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=8292110) was not confirmed: The Ministry of Health clarified that the girl had been a subject of contact with a dog which died shortly afterwards, was disposed of, and not presented for rabies examination. The girl thus underwent a PEP treatment precautionarily and was subsequently released.

Thanks are due to Dr Boris A. Yakobson for obtaining and submitting to us the said relieving information. - Mod.AS
