Hsu Hsu-mei, deputy director of the Department of Health's Bureau of
Communicable Disease Control, said that so far this year 32 cases of dengue
fever have been reported in Taiwan. All were contracted during visits to
Southeast Asian countries. This year's figure is double that of the same
period last year.
Of the 32 cases, nine originated in Indonesia, seven in the Philippines,
six in Thailand, five in Malaysia, two in Burma, two in Cambodia and one in
Vietnam.
So far no locally contracted dengue fever cases have been reported, but Hsu
said that the public should be aware of the possibility of an epidemic in
Taiwan as the weather becomes hotter and the rainfall is more abundant.
