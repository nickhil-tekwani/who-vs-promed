According to sources at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and
Prevention (CCDCP) 30 patients in Sichuan University's Huaxi Hospital
have been infected with gas gangrene. An isolation ward has been set
up to prevent the disease spreading. All patients injured in the
quake arriving at Huaxi Hospital will be sent to the isolation ward
for diagnosis on arrival.

Five patients diagnosed with gas gangrene disease on [14 May 2008]
are in a stable condition, according to Shi Yingkang, the dean of
Huaxi Hospital.

Gas gangrene is a bacterial infection that produces gas within
gangrenous tissue. People with open fractures are particularly
susceptible. It is caused by the clostridium bacteria and if left
untreated is usually fatal within 12 hours. Isolation of patients and
effective disinfection can prevent cross infection. It takes about 5
minutes to diagnose the disease by testing wound secretions.

There have been no cases of cross infection in Huaxi Hospital so far.
But rescuers in the quake-hit region have been warned not to make
direct contact with survivors' skin, and to follow effective
disinfection procedures.

Experts from CCDCP say isolation wards should be set up in all
hospitals receiving patients from the quake-hit area. All injured
persons transferred from the quake area should be first sent to
isolation wards to be checked for gas gangrene. If gas gangrene is
suspected, treatment must begin immediately. Thoroughly cleaning
wounds, removing foreign objects and dead tissue is the best way to
prevent clostridium infection.

[Another news release states that as of 19 May 2008, 58 cases of gas
gangrene had been reported by several major facilities treating
survivors of the earthquake in Sichuan, China. Of these, about 30
will require amputation (see
<http://en.ce.cn/National/Politics/200805/21/t20080521_15553120.shtml>).

Gas gangrene is a rapidly progressive, frequently fatal, necrotizing
infection of muscle that is usually caused by _Clostridium
perfringens_, and thus is also called clostridial myonecrosis. Gas
gangrene usually involves traumatic civilian and war wounds, but can
also involve surgical wounds, particularly after colon or biliary
surgery. Clostridial uterine myonecrosis can complicate a septic abortion.

Rarely, outbreaks of gas gangrene have been reported among injecting
illicit drug users, usually of heroin (see
<http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/gangrene-bacterium-blamed-for-drug-deaths-715317.html>)
or methamphetamine; gas gangrene has also been reported following
injections of medications, such as epinephrine, that can cause tissue ischemia.

Clostridia are commonly present in soil and in the normal colon, and
frequently contaminate open, traumatic wounds, although rarely
produce gas gangrene. (Gas gangrene develops in less than 1-2 percent
of these wounds.) Devitalized tissue, ischemia, foreign bodies in the
wound, and concurrent wound infection with other microorganisms
facilitate growth of clostridia and their elaboration of toxins.

Rapid diagnosis is facilitated by characteristic clinical findings,
identification of typical 'box-car' shaped gram-positive bacilli in
aspirates from the infected muscle or bullae, and muscle involvement
and gas in the muscle on computed tomography or magnetic resonance
imaging of the wound. Treatment includes prompt and extensive
surgical debridement of all necrotic tissue and removal of foreign
bodies from the wound, accompanied by appropriate antibiotic therapy.

Person-to-person transmission is said to be rare and outbreaks, other
than among injecting drug users, are very unusual. Consequently,
hospitalized patients are usually not isolated, in contrast to what
is stated in the news release. Further information is requested about
the cases in Sichuan, China. - Mod.ML
