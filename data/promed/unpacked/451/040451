Complex steps needed for airborne H5N1 spread in ferrets
--------------------------------------------------------
A series of complex changes allowed the H5N1 avian flu virus to become
transmissible via airborne droplets in ferrets, US researchers
reported in the journal 'Virology' [see Abstract of this publication
below]. Working on the assumption that acquisition of alpha-2-6
sialoside receptor specificity by alpha-2-3-specific H5N1 is a
prerequisite for efficient transmission in humans, they identified 4
variant viruses that had modestly increased alpha-2-6 and minimally
decreased alpha-2-3 binding. They then created a mutant virus
combining one of these variants (Q196R) with mutations from previous
pandemic viruses (Q226L and G228S) that had predominantly alpha-2-6
binding. This novel virus was transmitted between ferrets, which are
seen as good models of flu transmission in humans. Spread, however,
occurred by direct contact, not by airborne droplets. The team then
created a reassortant virus containing the mutant hemagglutinin, a
human N2 neuraminidase, and internal genes from an H5N1 virus, and
observed that it was "partially transmitted via respiratory droplets."
The researchers conclude, "The complex changes required for airborne
transmissibility in ferrets suggest that extensive evolution is needed
for H5N1 transmissibility in humans."

avian influenza virus toward human-type receptor specificity". By

The Abstract reproduced below provides more specific information.

"Acquisition of alpha 2-6 sialoside receptor specificity by alpha 2-3
specific highly-pathogenic avian influenza viruses (H5N1) is thought
to be a prerequisite for efficient transmission in humans. By in vitro
selection for binding alpha 2-6 sialosides, we identified 4 variant
viruses with amino acid substitutions in the hemagglutinin (S227N,
D187G, E190G, and Q196R) that revealed modestly increased alpha 2-6
and minimally decreased alpha 2-3 binding by glycan array analysis.
However, a mutant virus combining Q196R with mutations from previous
pandemic viruses (Q226L and G228S) revealed predominantly alpha 2-6
binding. Unlike the wild type H5N1, this mutant virus was transmitted
by direct contact in the ferret model although not by airborne
respiratory droplets. However, a reassortant virus with the mutant
hemagglutinin, a human N2 neuraminidase and internal genes from an
H5N1 virus was partially transmitted via respiratory droplets. The
complex changes required for airborne transmissibility in ferrets
suggest that extensive evolution is needed for H5N1 transmissibility
in humans."

These experiments demonstrated that multiple genetic changes were
required to produce experimentally a predominantly avian H5 influenza
virus that could be transmitted to ferrets (the mammal most
susceptible to influenza virus infection) by respiratory droplet
infection. These results are consistent with the rarity of H5N1 virus
infection in humans despite the extent of their exposure to avian H5N1
virus infection from diseased poultry. While these experiments do not
exclude the rapid evolution of a novel H5N1 human pandemic virus, this
is likely to be a rare event. The priority must remain to reduce the
exposure of humans to the avian virus in domestic poultry. - Mod.CP]
