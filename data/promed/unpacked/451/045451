Bird flu makes mallards thin, study finds
-----------------------------------------
Avian flu viruses make mallard ducks thinner than other ducks, a
finding that implies they do not spread the germs over long
distances, researchers reported on Tuesday [2 Dec 2008]. Their tests
of thousands of ducks migrating through Sweden showed the viruses do
affect the birds, contrary to conventional wisdom that the pathogens
have no effect on them. And, to their surprise, they found the birds
only "shed", or release, virus for a few days, the researchers
reported in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological
Sciences.

"Mallard ducks are a main reservoir for low-pathogenic avian
influenza [LPAI] virus in nature, yet surprisingly little is known
about how infection affects these birds," Jonas Waldenstrom of
Sweden's Kalmar University, Albert Osterhaus of Erasmus Medical
Center in Rotterdam and colleagues wrote.

A reservoir is a species that hosts a virus without becoming ill, and
thus serves to spread it. Avian flu viruses have most often been
found in migratory waterfowl, especially mallard ducks.

"We analyzed 10 000 samples from migratory mallards in Sweden for
presence of influenza virus and were able to demonstrate that
infected birds were leaner than uninfected birds, and that weight
loss was related to the amount of virus shed in their feces,"
Waldenstrom's team added. "Although many mallard populations are
migratory, the short virus shedding times (often less than a week)
imply that individual birds are not long-distance dispersers of the
virus on a continental scale."

There are hundreds of kinds of bird flu, and evidence suggests that
human forms of influenza originate in birds. Low-pathogenic avian
influenza strains generally have little effect, although the highly
pathogenic forms can wipe out flocks in a matter of days. Highly
pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza [HPAI] is currently affecting flocks
in Asia, parts of Europe, and Africa and experts fear it may mutate
into a form that humans can catch and transmit easily. If it does, it
could kill millions. Even in its current hard-to-catch form, H5N1 has
infected 387 people and killed 245 since 2003. Researchers do not
know precisely how it spreads, although migrating birds are prime
suspects, as is the poultry trade.

Waldenstrom's team found that infection did not affect how fast or
far the birds migrated. On average, the ducks were infected 8 days
and spread the virus for just 3 of them in their droppings. "The
short virus shedding time suggests that individual mallards are less
likely to spread the virus at continental or intercontinental
scales," they wrote. But they may stay longer in one place when they
are infected -- something that needs to be studied, they added.

[All of which makes sense but members should remember that this virus
shedding research was on LPAI infected birds, not HPAI infections.
While the 2 may be essentially similar, confirmation is awaited. -
