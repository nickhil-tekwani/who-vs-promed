Cases of the highly contagious, often fatal, disease of distemper are occurring earlier than usual in the valley. As a result, the Arizona Humane Society has issued a community-wide health alert to pet owners within Arizona. Extra caution is urged as earlier than usual cases have also emerged as far away as Florida, Ohio, and Georgia. While increased occurrences of distemper typically arise in the spring due to an increase in the number of litters of puppies, signs of the disease are appearing much earlier.

Evidence exists to suggest that 2 new strains of distemper have made their way to the US from Europe, putting elderly dogs at risk as well as the young. While the typical incubation period for distemper is 1-2 weeks, the 2 new strains may have even longer incubation periods. Distemper was once thought of as a disease that primarily affected puppies who have not had all of their "puppy" shots; however, there is evidence of older pets with unconfirmed vaccination histories becoming infected with the distemper virus.

[Canine distemper is caused by a paramyxovirus closely related to the viruses of measles and rinderpest. The enveloped virus is sensitive to lipid solvents and most disinfectants and is relatively unstable outside the host. The main route of infection is via aerosol droplet secretions from infected animals. Some infected dogs may shed virus for several months.

Dogs may have incubation periods as long as 3 weeks. Veterinarians in many places of the US have been seeing this 'new strain' prior to now.

Distemper should be considered in the diagnosis of any febrile condition in any age dogs but especially puppies and elderly dogs with multisystemic manifestations. While the typical clinical case is not difficult to diagnose, the characteristic signs sometimes fail to appear until late in the disease. The clinical picture may be modified by concurrent toxoplasmosis, neosporosis, coccidiosis, parasitoses, and numerous viral and bacterial infections. Distemper is sometimes confused with other systemic infections such as leptospirosis, infectious canine hepatitis, or Rocky Mountain spotted fever. Intoxicants such as lead or organophosphates can cause simultaneous GI or neurologic sequelae. A febrile catarrhal illness with neurologic sequelae justifies a clinical diagnosis of distemper. At necropsy, diagnosis is usually confirmed by histologic lesions or immunofluorescent assay for viral antigen in tissues, or both. In dogs with multisystemic signs, conjunctival, tracheal, vaginal, or other epithelium, or the buffy coat of the blood can be examined by immunofluorescent assay. These samples are usually negative when the dog is showing only neurologic manifestations or when circulating antibody is present (or both). The diagnosis can then be made by serologic demonstration of virus-specific IgM or an increased ratio of CSF to serum virus-specific IgG.

Treatments are directed at limiting secondary bacterial invasion, supporting fluid balance, and controlling nervous manifestations. Antibiotics, balanced electrolyte solutions, parenteral nutrition, dietary supplements, antipyretics, nasal preparations, analgesics, and anticonvulsants are used. No single treatment is specific or uniformly successful. Dogs may recover completely from systemic manifestations, but good nursing care is essential. Despite intensive care, some dogs do not make a satisfactory recovery. Unfortunately, treatment for acute neurologic manifestations of distemper is unsuccessful. If the neurologic signs are progressive or severe, the owner should be appropriately advised. Dogs with some of the more chronic progressive or vaccine-induced forms of neurologic disease may respond to immunosuppressive therapy with anti-inflammatory or greater dosages of glucocorticoids.

Successful immunization of pups with canine distemper modified live virus (MLV) vaccines depends on the lack of interference by maternal antibody. To overcome this barrier, pups are vaccinated with MLV vaccine when 6 weeks old and at 2- to 4-week intervals until 16 weeks old. Measles virus induces immunity to canine distemper virus in the presence of relatively greater levels of maternal distemper antibody. An MLV measles vaccine and a combination of MLV measles and MLV canine distemper vaccine are available. Measles vaccines must be administered IM. Pups 6-7 weeks old should receive the measles or combination vaccine and at least 2 more doses of MLV distemper vaccine when 12-16 weeks old. Many varieties of attenuated distemper vaccine are available and should be used according to manufacturers' directions. MLV vaccines can produce postvaccinal illness in some immunosuppressed dogs. A recombinant canarypox vector vaccine expressing distemper virus proteins is available. Annual revaccination has been suggested because of the breaks in neurologic distemper that can occur in stressed, diseased, or immunosuppressed dogs. Longer than yearly intervals of administration have been suggested with MLV vaccines; however, this should be tempered with the prevalence of the disease and other potential risk factors.
