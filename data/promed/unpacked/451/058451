[The location of the outbreak can be seen on the map included in the OIE report at the source URL above.

Contagious bovine pleuropneumonia (CBPP) is a disease of cattle caused by _Mycoplasma mycoides_ subsp. _mycoides_ SC (SC = small colonies). It is manifested by anorexia, fever, and respiratory signs such as dyspnoea, polypnoea, cough, and nasal discharges. Diagnosis depends on the isolation of the aetiological agent. The main problems for control or eradication are the frequent occurrence of subacute or subclinical infections and the persistence of chronic carriers after the clinical phase. It is an OIE-listed (previously, List A), non-zoonotic disease.

According to OIE's WAHID data, CBPP is a notifiable disease in Zambia, present in domestic cattle as a "clinical disease" (2008: 21 outbreaks; 2009: 29; 2010: 12; 2011: present, no quantitative data; 2012: not yet available). See also previous reports in "see also".

The disease control measures, as applicable to the disease, are -- reportedly -- "monitoring, screening, general surveillance, targeted surveillance, movement control inside the country, and routine vaccination". Stamping out is not included.

The unusual timetable of the event described, including its "start" (date of import?) on 26 Oct 2012, lab test/pre-confirmation (30 Jan 2013), resolved (25 Apr 2013) deserve explanation. An "epidemiological comment" could be helpful. - Mod.AS
