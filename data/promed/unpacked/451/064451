[1] Ontario (Markham, Prince Edward County): mixed flocks

Four more bird flu outbreaks were reported by the federal government on Thursday [7 Apr 2022], including one at a farm in Chatham-Kent. With the addition of the latest cases, a total of 10 outbreaks have been declared in Ontario since 27 Mar 2022.

The Chatham-Kent outbreak -- detected on Wednesday [6 Apr 2022] but not announced by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency until Thursday -- is in a poultry flock, but the agency did not say what kind of bird.

There are also 2 new cases in poultry flocks in Markham and one in Prince Edward County in a backyard flock on a hobby farm. In all of the cases, the food inspection agency has confirmed tests show the presence of the highly pathogenic H5N1 strain of avian influenza.

Before Thursday [7 Apr 2022], half a dozen properties in Ontario had been quarantined, including a farm in western Oxford County, where the movement of birds and eggs is being restricted inside one of 2 control zones set up by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency in Ontario.

Samples taken by the agency are sent to a lab in Winnipeg each time an outbreak is confirmed. "So there's a time delay" before a case is confirmed, said Ingrid DeVisser, a turkey producer in Bruce County who heads up the Feather Board Command Centre, the poultry industry's emergency response team. Farmers and scientists can be tipped off by a high mortality situation, which happens when a larger than usual number of birds in a flock die. DeVisser said the poultry farmers she's talked to are "very, very concerned" about the situation. "We're all taking this very, very seriously," she said.

Ontario is the largest producer of poultry in the country, with much of the industry in south western Ontario. Ontario turkey producers' market between 85 million to 90 million kilograms of turkey annually, about 45% of the total raised in Canada. Ontario farmers also raise more than 200 million chickens a year.

DeVisser said "a lot of mental energy is being expended on top of the physical energy" to contain the outbreaks. The avian influenza situation "certainly adds to the stress" poultry producers are experiencing, on top of rising fuel costs, inflation and the pandemic, she said. COVID-19 was in some ways a dry run for how farmers are having to operate now. "We are just watching our biosecurity and thinking through every decision we make on our farms in terms of what the vectors are, what the risk exposure is, and just being absolutely careful we're doing the right things and all the things are necessary," she said.

The Canadian Food Inspection Agency says bird flu is spreading in wild bird populations around the world and is a "significant national concern" as birds migrate to Canada.

[2] Ontario (Wellington): ducks

A new case of bird flu has been detected at a farm in Centre Wellington. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) has established control zones to try and contain the spread of the H5N1 strain. They've been set up around infected areas, with a 10 kilometre [6.2 mi] radius, to limit the movement of domestic birds, eggs and poultry products.

Dr Shayan Sharif, an immunologist with the Ontario Veterinary College, calls the H5N1 strain highly contagious [HPAI]. "If the virus gets in, it's not going to get out and making sure the virus doesn't get into new premises," he told CTV News. "These zones have proven quite effective."

The case identified on Monday [4 Apr 2022] came from a duck flock in Centre Wellington. Another control zone was put in place in March [2022] after the bird flu was found on a turkey farm near Guelph.

"If it undergoes several rounds of mutations it could gain the capacity to transmit to humans, but not at this point," said Dr. Sharif. While the threat to humans doesn't compare to the level of wiping out entire farms full of birds, backyard flocks are also at risk.

The CFIA has set up control measures in the surrounding area. They've also provided recommendations for enhanced biosecurity.

As Ontario is one the largest turkey and chicken producers in Canada, the question remains whether the measures are enough to prevent widespread devastation. "Time will tell, but from some of the indications it appears the virus has actually spread among wild birds, and that is disconcerting to me," said Dr Sharif.

Diseases like the bird flu (or avian influenza) can cause serious illness or death in many species. The government of Canada has put together recommendations on preventing and detecting disease in backyard flocks and pet birds:
- Prevent contact with wild birds and other animals. Many animals can carry viruses, parasites and bacteria. Your pet's food and water should be kept away from wild animals to prevent them from becoming contaminated.
- Keep their surroundings clean. Viruses, parasites and bacteria can live in organic matter like litter and soil. They recommend cleaning out barns, gardening tools as well as water and feed containers, not sharing equipment with other bird owners, and washing your hands after handling birds.
- Check for signs. Signs could include lack of energy, movement or appetite; decreased egg production; swelling around the head, neck and eyes; coughing, gasping for air or sneezing; nervousness, tremors or lack of coordination; diarrhea and sudden death. Call your veterinarian if you suspect your animal is sick with bird flu. Owners are also legally responsible to notify authorities.
- Limit contact with other people. People can also spread bird diseases. They can be passed through hands, clothes, boots, and tire and wheel wells.
- Keep new birds separate from your flock. They recommend isolating new birds for at least 30 days before introducing them to an existing flock.

The Canadian Food Inspection Agency says bird flu has been found in Alberta poultry flocks and there are some new cases in Ontario. The agency says the highly pathogenic H5N1 strain of avian flu was confirmed on Wednesday [6 Apr 2022] in 2 poultry flocks in Mountain View County and one flock in Ponoka County in Alberta.

On Thursday [7 Apr 2022] agency [announced that] the infected premises have been placed under quarantine, there is an investigation, and it will be establishing movement control measures on other farms within these areas. It said these cases had been reported to the World Organisation for Animal Health.

The agency says avian influenza is not a significant public health concern for healthy people who are not in regular contact with infected birds. Bird flu cases in poultry and non-poultry flocks have previously been reported in recent months in Ontario, Nova Scotia, and Newfoundland and Labrador. The most recent bird flu outbreak began last year [2021] in Europe and has since spread to the United States and Canada, devastating some commercial farms with its very high mortality rate.

[In an article from Ontario, Canada, the comment was made regarding everything we do is to protect our birds. This is absolutely correct. Everything you do related to your birds matters. Every step, every action must be deliberate with security for your birds foremost in your mind.

This virus is wreaking disaster on every aspect of the avian industry. It has touched commercial producers as well as backyard growers and hobbyists with only a few birds. If you have birds as pets, be aware, because this virus does not discriminate; bring your pets inside and do not visit anyone who has pet or commercial birds.

Biosecurity is the watchword of every hobbyist, backyard producer, and commercial producer. This serious virus should cause all of us to think, breathe and act with the safety of our birds and others' birds uppermost in our minds and actions. - Mod.TG
