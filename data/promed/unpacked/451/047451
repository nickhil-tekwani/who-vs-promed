Residents of a village in Abu Arish governorate, east of the Jizan region, complained about the incursion of a strange disease that transforms goats into skeletons before killing them; amid fears of transmission and expansion of the disease, [the residents] demanded vaccination.

Samples were collected from sick goats about a week ago by the agriculture department, and results are indicative of infection with the highly contagious pleuritis, or what is known among the public as "Abu Ramah".

A (farmer) called on the Ministry of Environment, Water and Agriculture to apply seasonal vaccinations for livestock in the region and to educate the [owners] about the seriousness of this disease, noting that his neighbor's livestock also suffers from the same problem.

[CCPP (contagious caprine pleuropneumonia), an OIE-listed disease caused by the bacterium _Mycoplasma capricolum_ subsp. _capripneumoniae_ (_MCCP_), is one of the most severe diseases of goats. It affects the respiratory tract and is extremely contagious, frequently fatal. In naive flocks, the morbidity rate may reach 100%, and the mortality rate can be as high as 80%. CCPP causes major economic losses in East Africa and the Middle East, where it is endemic. The disease is not zoonotic.

OIE's disease card "contagious caprine pleuropneumonia," addressing the aetiology, epidemiology, diagnosis, prevention, and control of the disease, is available at https://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Animal_Health_in_the_World/docs/pdf/Disease_cards/CONTAGIOUS_CAPRINE_PLEURO.pdf.

CCPP is endemic in Saudi Arabia; during the 1st semester of 2019 (January-June 2019, last available periodic report to OIE), 211 260 goats were reportedly vaccinated. The figure for entire 2018 was 823 412.
