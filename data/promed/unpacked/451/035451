The Netherlands is to cull around 102 000 chickens on a farm in the northern city of Kiel-Windeweer after the detection of a highly infectious strain of bird flu, the government said on Tuesday [4 Oct 2022].

Fifteen cases of the highly lethal form of avian flu have been reported in the Netherlands in the past month, following dozens of cases earlier in the year.

France has also seen a resurgence in cases after experiencing its worst-ever bird flu wave earlier this year [2022].

Bird flu was diagnosed on a poultry farm in Kiel-Windeweer (municipality of Midden-Groningen, province of Groningen). It is probably a highly pathogenic variant. To prevent the virus from spreading, the approximately 102 150 broilers at the location are culled by the Dutch Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority (NVWA).

There are no other poultry farms in the 1 km [0.6 mi] zone around the infected farm.

There is one other poultry farm in the 3 km [1.9 mi] zone around the infected farm. This company will be screened for bird flu by the NVWA.

Six other poultry farms are located in the 10 km [6.2 mi] zone around the infected farm. In this area there is now a confinement obligation, a screening obligation, and a transport ban.

National measures
-----------------
A transport ban applies to all birds and hatching and table eggs from a location with birds. The ban also applies to bird manure and used litter, and to other animals and animal products from poultry farms. In addition, rules apply to hunting. For example, in this area it is prohibited to hunt ducks or to hunt in areas where this could disturb waterfowl. You can see exactly where this is on the animal disease viewer of the Netherlands Enterprise Agency, RVO (https://data.rvo.nl/dierziektenviewer/index.html).

Traceability investigation
--------------------------
As usual, in the context of the contamination at this location, a tracing investigation is carried out into high-risk contacts. If necessary, additional measures will be taken in response to the results of the investigation. Any additional measures will be reported via an update in this press release and via the online channels of the Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality (LNV).

[3] Groningen: organic laying poultry farm

In Wildervank (municipality of Veendam, province of Groningen) bird flu was diagnosed at an organic laying poultry farm. To prevent the spread of the virus, the approximately 14 740 chickens at the location are being culled by the Dutch Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority (NVWA).

There is also a 2nd poultry farm in the yard with 3600 laying hens. That is also cleared, because there is a very real chance that it is also infected.

Both companies have already been intensively monitored by the Animal Health Service (GD) because they are 100 m [328 ft] away from a poultry farm where bird flu was diagnosed on 29 Sep [2022].

Within the 1 km [0.6 mi] zone of the organic poultry farm that is now infected, there is one other poultry farm. The animals on this farm are examined by the NVWA and intensively monitored by GD for 14 days.

There are 6 poultry farms in the 3 km [1.9 mi] zone, which are also being examined for bird flu by the NVWA. There are 22 poultry farms in the 10 km [6.2 mi] zone around the infected farm. Strict measures were already in place in this area, including a confinement obligation, screening obligation, and a transport ban.

[The 2 mentioned new HPAI foci, in Kiel-Windeweer and Wildervank, are situated some 17-25 km [10.6-15.5 mi] south-eastern to the town of Groningen, in Netherlands' northeast province Groningen, bordering Germany on its east and the North Sea on its north.

Wageningen Bioveterinary Research (WBVR), which is the Dutch national reference centre for avian influenza, maintains web pages dedicated to each HPAI season. The 2022/2023 season has started 1 Oct 2022. As of 4 Oct [2022], the following 2 outbreaks are presented in a table which is to be updated continuously; the new event in Wildervank is yet to be added.
