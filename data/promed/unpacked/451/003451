As the world marked World Hepatitis Day on Sunday [28 Jul 2013], experts in Patna say that out of 5 [causes] of hepatitis -- also known as inflammation of the liver -- hepatitis E has assumed epidemic portions in certain parts of the city.

Hepatitis E spreads through contaminated food and water. "In Patna, it has assumed epidemic [proportions] in areas where there is garbage all around and pure water is unavailable," said noted physician Dr Gopal Prasad Sinha.

Hepatitis A, like hepatitis E, is spread through contaminated food and water and poor sanitation. However, unlike hepatitis E, a vaccine is available for hepatitis A. "It is seasonal, and its cases usually rise in rainy season," said Dr Gaurav Kumar, gastroenterologist with AIIMS-Patna [All India Institute of Medical Sciences-Patna]. Hepatitis B and C are leading causes of liver cancer and are spread through sexual contact or transfusion of infected blood.

[Hepatitis E is a liver disease caused by the hepatitis E virus: a non-enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded ribonucleic acid (RNA) virus. Hepatitis E virus is transmitted mainly through contaminated drinking water. It is usually a self-limiting infection and resolves within 4-6 weeks. Occasionally, a fulminant form of hepatitis develops (acute liver failure), which can lead to death.

Hepatitis E is found worldwide, and different genotypes of hepatitis E virus determine differences in epidemiology. Genotype 1 is usually seen in developing countries and causes community-level outbreaks, while genotype 3 is usually seen in the developed countries and does not cause outbreaks. Globally, 57 000 deaths and 3.4 million cases of acute hepatitis E are attributable to infection with hepatitis E virus genotypes 1 and 2.

Further information is awaited concerning the extent and severity of the outbreak of hepatitis E in Patna. Patna is the capital of the Indian state of Bihar, and its most populous city, and also the 2nd most populous city of Eastern India. It is the administrative, industrial, and educational centre of the state. The modern city of Patna is on the southern bank of the Ganges. The city also straddles the rivers Sone, Gandak and Punpun. In June 2009, the World Bank ranked Patna in 2nd place in India, after Delhi, in terms of the ease of starting a business. Patna has been ranked as the 21st fastest growing city in the world and 5th fastest growing city in India by City Mayors Foundation.
