Five cases of suspected hemorrhagic fever with 4 fatal outcomes in Butumba
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
The situation for the past month: according to the district chief
medical officer of Upper Lomami, a report issued by the Butumba
health zone, approximately 500 kilometres (311 mi) from Lumbumbashi
in Katanga, reported 5 cases of hemorrhagic fever in this
jurisdiction, all from a single health area, Bulongo, reported [Radio Okapi.]

Samples were collected by a provincial team and sent to Kinshasa.
According to Dr Patrick Banza, chief medical officer for the health
district of Upper Lomami, the disease presents with a fever and
bleeding from the nose, anus, and mouth. "We had a case in the 24th
week [9-15 Jun 2008], then in the 25th week [16-22 Jun 2008], another
case [words missing].... In total there have been 5 [cases] and 4 of
whom have died." According to the source, a team from Lumbumbashi and
supported by WHO, has already obtained clinical samples. "Until then,
we are awaiting the results to confirm [the cause of death and await
the outcome of the surviving case. In the field, we have taken
precautions so that the entire nursing staff who had contact with
these patients and their families are closely monitored," said the
chief medical officer of the health district of Upper Lomami.

[During the course of 2008, outbreaks of monkeypox, yellow fever,
pneumonic plague, meningococcal meningitis, and Ebola hemorrhagic
fever have been reported from the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
Of these the current outbreak in Katanga most resembles Ebola
hemorrhagic fever. However, the suspected outbreak of hemorrhagic
fever earlier in 2008 and the mixed outbreak of Ebola hemorrhagic
fever and other infections in 2007 occurred at locations remote from
the current outbreak of hemorrhagic fever in Katanga. Further
information is awaited.
