Phnom Penh health and municipal authorities Friday began to mobilize the
citizens to get a thorough cleaning to prevent the dengue fever which is
spreading rapidly in Cambodia.
Chea Sophara, Phnom Penh's first deputy governor, and Health Minister Chea
Thang will be among thousands of other Phnom Penh citizens to clean up the
environment. The plan is to get city residents to fill in holes, cover
water jars and dispose of garbage around their homes that could collect
water and become breeding sites for mosquitos. About 8,700 children have
been admitted to hospitals and more than two hundred have died since an
outbreak in January, a Health Ministry official told Xinhua Thursday. The
number could rise to more than 15,000 by the end of this year's rainy
season, making it the worst dengue epidemic in the country's
history. So far the worst-hit areas are Phnom Penh, and Kandal, Takeo,
Battambang and Kampong Cham provinces.
