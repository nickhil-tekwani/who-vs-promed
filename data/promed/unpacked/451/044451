Carolina Waterfowl Rescue is asking for the public's help to locate any sick or dying ducks after 48 dead wild mallards were found in the Indian Trail [Union County, North Carolina] area. The nonprofit organization is treating 2 ducks after being rescued and says that they're in critical condition.

Officials with the nonprofit are in agreement that the cause of the sickened and dying ducks is botulism but are unsure of the source. They say they have preliminary laboratory results concluding that it is not infectious. "We need to continue to be on the look out for ducks that require medical care," says Carolina Waterfowl director Jennifer Gordon. "The mortality isn't great but if we get them quickly they will have a chance."

All of the ducks have been found at ponds on the Indian Trail area as well as nearby private property. Volunteers will be going out to try and rescue sickened ducks.

[Avian botulism is a paralytic disease caused by ingestion of a toxin produced by the bacteria _Clostridium botulinum_. These bacteria are widespread in soil and require warm temperatures, a protein source, and an anaerobic (no oxygen) environment in order to become active and produce toxin.

There are several types of toxin produced by strains of this bacterium; birds are most commonly affected by type C and to a lesser extent type E. Type C toxin is found in waterfowl, shorebirds, colonial waterbirds, and others; whereas type E toxin is found in gulls, loons, and others. - Mod.PMB
