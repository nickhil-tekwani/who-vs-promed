Authorities have closed off a poultry farm in southern Germany after
an outbreak of bird flu.
Local veterinary authorities said late on Friday [24 Aug 2007] checks
at the farm in the Erlangen-Hoechstadt area in Bavaria had discovered
birds infected with the H5N1 virus.
A spokeswoman said samples would be examined to determine whether the
birds were infected with the deadly strain of H5N1. There was no
danger to people in the area, she said.
The farm contains around 44 000 birds.
Germany identified several cases of the deadly H5N1 strain in wild
birds in Bavaria in June [2007]. Several bird flu infections were
also registered in Germany last year [2006].
Earlier this week, Russia banned poultry imports from Italy to
prevent the spread of bird flu after outbreaks there.

[Besides a single domestic goose, which was found serologically
positive in Thuringia, at the beginning of July, the current outbreak
-- if confirmed -- will be the 1st outbreak in a commercial poultry
in Germany in 2007. It will be interesting to obtain details on the
possible exposure of this flock to wild, free roaming birds. The HPAI
(highly pathogenic avian influenza) H5N1 virus has been detected in
wild birds in Germany, particularly Bavaria, since June 2007.
According to the ADNS (European Commission Animal Disease
Notification System) data, as of 24 August, a total of 306 HPAI cases
in wild birds have been notified by member states in 2007; the 1st
cases were detected towards the end of June. Of the 306 cases, 298
were reported from Germany, 7 from France, and one from the Czech
Republic. See tables and graphs, pertaining to weekly figures and to
the species involved, at
<http://ec.europa.eu/food/animal/diseases/adns/adns_wildbirds2007.pdf>.
The July 2007 issue of the Journal of Wildlife Diseases (Vol. 43, No.
3) includes a supplement with 14 papers dealing with the subject
"Wild birds and the epidemiology of avian influenza"; see

Bird flu has spread to 2 more provinces in Viet Nam, killing hundreds
of chickens and ducks, the Agriculture Ministry said on Friday [24 Aug 2007].
The outbreak of H5N1 in the northern province of Thai Nguyen and Dong
Thap to the south brought to 4 the number of provinces on the
government's current bird flu watch list. Vietnam has 64 provinces.
A total of 150 ducks and 35 chickens fell sick on Wednesday [22 Aug
2007] in Thai Nguyen, 80 km (50 miles) north of Hanoi, and tests have
confirmed they had the H5N1 virus, the ministry's Animal Health
Department said in a report.
The virus also struck a farm in the southern Mekong delta province of
Dong Thap where 250 chickens were found dead on Sunday [19 Aug 2007], it said.
Bird flu has infected 7 people in Viet Nam so far this year [2007], 4
of whom have died, bringing the death toll since late 2003 to 46, the
government said.
