I have been following the reports on Promed about the anthrax attack, as well as reviewing the FBI report, and recent books written about the events, and have pieced together some interesting, hopefully relevant thoughts.

The recent posting about the lack of meglumine and diatrizoate on the evidentiary spores matches a statement from the DOJ/FBI report (1) that indicates that there were no traces of renografin on the mailing material, a substance that apparently contains meglumine and diatrizoate. According to the recent post, the RMR-1029 flask contained spores that had been purified using materials containing these substances, indicating that direct use of these spores was not involved.

Basically this inconsistency runs against the FBI finding that the genetic analysis of the evidentiary spores linked RMR-1029 flash to the attack. The quote from the FBI report indicates that water purification could have been used to purify the evidentiary spores, accounting for the lack of renografin substances. The question becomes, then, whether water washing of the spores from RMR-1029 could have removed traces of meglumine or diatrizoate from the spores, still linking Dr. Ivins to the attack.

I could not find in the FBI report something to say that washing spores from RMR-1029 could have removed the renografin (meglumine or diatrizoate). Would anyone have the answer to this? Otherwise, Dr. Ivins would have had to obtain fresh spores, equal genetically to those found by the FBI, and then water washed them for purification purposes. I wonder about the probability of this.

Now, having read the 2 books on the investigation, "American Anthrax," by Jeanne Guillemin, and "The Mirage Man," by David Willman, I am of the impression that the FBI used the Reid method of interrogation on Dr. Ivins, i.e., one which basically involves 1st interviews, followed by accusatory interrogation once they have felt they have found the perpetrator of a crime, in order to extract a confession. In reading the accounts, I often wondered why an indictment was not pursued considering the circumstantial evidence. Perhaps the reason was that the inconsistency was known by authorities, could not adequately be explained, and thus would have had to be revealed to the defense as exculpatory evidence.

My own thought is that the case is not yet closed.

Footnote:
(1) "An expert microbiologist from Dugway stated that these hours (comment: a period of 69 hours that occurred between the 1st and 2nd mailings, a time assumed to be used for further purification of spores, and a time for which Dr. Ivins could not account to any degree) were consistent with someone preparing the anthrax letters. He specifically noted that the spore-washing process would take some time, especially if the mailer were not using a density gradient to clean the spores. This is significant because there are no traces of renografin on the mailing material, which means that the spores could have simply been water-purified, as opposed to this other measure. The expert noted that with respect to the material in the 1st mailings, he would have been "embarrassed to send that out" because it was so granular - further support for the notion that the additional time expended in preparing the 2nd round of materials may have been due to further washing/purifying of the spores" (From United States Department of Justice, Ameritrax Investigation Summary, February 10, 2010, page 32).

[Dennis raises the question whether the renografin (meglumine or diatrizoate) could have been washed off during washing the spores. A fair question and if there any members with sound expert knowledge on this subject, we would be glad to hear from them.

If the renografin chemicals cannot be removed by washing this would put the letter spores' origin immediately away from the RMR-1029 flask, even if cultured from a common source or from material shared taken from the flask. I would remind members that the letter contents had a _B. subtilis_ contaminant, which was not found in the contents of the RMR-1029 flask. While the FBI dismissed the importance of this contaminant Bacillus it has the potential of being an institutional fingerprint. - Mod MHJ]
