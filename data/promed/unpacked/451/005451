10 die of mysterious disease in Dir
-----------------------------------
A total of 10 people have died of an unknown disease in Lower Dir
while another 15 have been shifted to a hospital with the same
symptoms. According to locals, the disease broke out around 15 days
ago, with symptoms of severe temperature and body ache which resulted
in death within 2 weeks. Doctors say the symptoms of the disease are
similar to dengue [fever]. The blood samples of the affected persons
have been sent to the National Institute of Health in Islamabad; 3
critically ill patients have been shifted to Khyber Teaching Hospital,
Peshawar, where they are being kept in an isolation ward.

One [suspected] dengue patient was diagnosed with the Crimean-Congo
hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) virus infection in Karachi, causing alarm in
the city.

ProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall

[The description of the symptoms of the illness responsible for the 10
fatalities and 15 hospitalised cases in Lower Dir is not sufficient to
suggest a diagnosis. Dengue fever appears to have been excluded, but
CCHF virus infection remains a possibility. It is unclear at present
if there is any similarity between this outbreak and the deaths of
patients at the Ayub Hospital Abbottabad, also in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa
(see the preceding ProMED-mail report, archive number 20100927.3505).
Further information would be welcomed.

Dir is a town in Upper Dir District, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province
(formerly North-West Frontier Province), Pakistan. It lies at the foot
of the Lowarai Pass, the main motor road to Chitral, on the Dir River,
a tributary of the Panjkora River. The HealthMap/ProMED-mail
