In the previous posting the moderator made the statement, "The only way to
eradicate the disease quickly in commercial poultry is by destroying
infected flocks and imposing a strict quarantine."
I would respectfully like to differ with the above statement. In Virginia,
in 2002 low-pathogenic H7 AI was controlled by the above program
[destruction of the flock]. It cost $160 million and took 10 weeks from the
time the government started until the last AI case. In Utah in 1995
low-pathogenic H7 AI was controlled by vaccination and controlled
marketing. It cost about $2.6 million and took 10 weeks. (Halvorson, DA, et
al, Economics of AI control, Proceedings of the Western Poultry Disease
Conference, 2003.)

[Dr. Halvorson is correct, and I appreciate his reminder. I do not have an
explanation for the difference between Virginia in 2002 and Utah in 1995.
Perhaps it lies in the number of amino acid differences between the
low-pathogenic AI and AI mutating to the highly pathogenic form. My
statement was based on the situation in Virginia in 2002. There are other
ways of controlling/eradicating this disease. - Mod.TG]
