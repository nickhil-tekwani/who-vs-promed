Public Health has confirmed a case of human infection with anthrax in Extremadura. A veterinarian has been infected while conducting a necropsy that the health professional performed on a cow in the Alburquerque (Extremadura) cattle farm.

The Animal Health services have not been able to confirm the possible case in livestock because the reference laboratory does not have the necessary material to carry out the analyses and precise cultures that are required.

Still, the Board reports that in the livestock farm all surveillance and control measurers will be taken. This Friday [16 Sep 2022], in addition, all cattle (at this location) will be vaccinated.

[Extremadura is an autonomous community in southern Spain on the border with Portugal (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extremadura).

This is but the latest in a series of anthrax outbreaks in this province (refer to the See Also section below). So the veterinarian examining the cow carcass should have noted the bloated nature of the carcass and the extravasated blood from the various body openings -- very characteristic signs of anthrax. The deficiencies in the local veterinary diagnostic laboratory stopping them from a laboratory confirmation is surprising -- the normal diagnosis is not that complicated even if one checks blood smears -- but it will explain the continuing sporadic nature of this disease in the province and its impact on control and surveillance efficiency and effectiveness. Fortunately, cutaneous anthrax responds quickly to antibiotics, while this veterinarian and his immediate colleagues have learnt an important lesson: never necropsy a suspected anthrax case. - Mod.MHJ
