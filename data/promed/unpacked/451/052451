Abstract
---------
Investment in Africa over the past year with regards to SARS-CoV-2 genotyping has led to a massive increase in the number of sequences, exceeding 100 000 genomes generated to track the pandemic on the continent. Our results show an increase in the number of African countries able to sequence within their own borders, coupled with a decrease in sequencing turnaround time. Findings from this genomic surveillance underscores the heterogeneous nature of the pandemic, but we observe repeated dissemination of SARS-CoV-2 variants within the continent. Sustained investment for genomic surveillance in Africa is needed as the virus continues to evolve, particularly in the low-vaccination landscape. These investments are very crucial for preparedness and response for future pathogen outbreaks.

Three new observational studies from Scotland, Denmark, and the United States detail reduced hospitalizations and emergency department (ED) visits for omicron COVID-19 infections relative to those caused by the delta variant, as well as strong but waning 3rd-dose vaccine effectiveness over time against omicron.

In Scotland, a team led by University of Edinburgh researchers conducted a test-negative case-control study of national COVID-19 infections among residents from 1 Nov-19 Dec 2021, to estimate effectiveness of a 3rd vaccine dose against symptomatic illness relative to that 25 weeks or more after receipt of the 2nd dose. The study was published late last week in The Lancet Infectious Diseases [https://doi.org/10.1016/S1473-3099(22)00141-4].

By study end, 23 840 omicron infections were reported, primarily among those 20-39 years old (49.2%). The proportion of possible omicron reinfections was more than 10 times that of delta cases (7.6% vs 0.7%).

Fifteen patients infected with omicron were hospitalized, for an adjusted observed-to-expected admission ratio of 0.32. A 3rd COVID-19 vaccine dose was tied to a 57% reduction in the risk of symptomatic omicron infection, compared with patients at least 25 weeks after the 2nd dose.

"These early national data suggest that omicron is associated with a 2/3 reduction in the risk of COVID-19 hospitalisation compared with delta," the researchers wrote. "Although offering the greatest protection against delta, the booster dose of vaccination offers substantial additional protection against the risk of symptomatic COVID-19 for omicron compared with 25 weeks or more after the 2nd vaccine dose."

The authors noted that a combination of an increased risk of viral spread and omicron immune evasion could mean that any benefit of reduced hospital admission rates could be exceeded by higher rates of infection in the community.

"Incorporation of our data on the risk for hospitalisation within modelling output could inform decisions by policy makers regarding the speed, range, nature, and duration of societal measures that otherwise would be needed to control the risk of spread of infection and minimise the risk of overwhelming health system capacity," they wrote.

In the study in Denmark, also published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases [https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(22)00154-2/fulltext#%20], Statens Serum Institut researchers reviewed the 188 980 COVID-19 infections reported in the national COVID-19 surveillance system from 21 Nov-19 Dec 2021. A total of 38 669 cases (20.5%) were caused by omicron.

Relative to delta, omicron was linked to an adjusted relative risk (aRR) of hospitalization of 0.64, with 0.6% of omicron patients admitted versus 1.5% of 150 311 delta patients, for a 36% lower likelihood of hospitalization for omicron relative to delta.

Among the 124 313 Danes (65.8%) who received 2 doses of COVID-19 vaccine, the aRR of hospitalization for omicron infection was 0.24, much lower than that among those who were unvaccinated or had received only one dose.

In a similar comparison by vaccination status, the RR of hospitalization was 0.57 among patients who received no or only one dose of vaccine, while it was 0.71 among those who received 2 doses, and 0.50 among recipients of 3 doses.

"We found a significantly lower risk of hospitalisation with omicron infection compared with delta infection among both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals, suggesting an inherent reduced severity of omicron," the researchers wrote. "Our results could guide modelling of the effect of the ongoing global omicron wave and thus health-care system preparedness."

The study was also presented at the European Congress of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, which ends tomorrow [26 Apr 2022] in Portugal.

In a commentary on both studies, Cornelia Adlhoch, DVM, PhD, and Helena de Carvalho Gomes, MD, MPH, both of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, underscored the critical nature of ongoing COVID-19 surveillance systems that enable studies such as the ones from Scotland and Denmark [https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(22)00174-8/fulltext].

"How long will countries be able to keep such comprehensive systems active for SARS-CoV-2 surveillance?" they asked. "Many countries in Europe are already reducing testing availability and limiting sequencing for various reasons, including availability of resources."

They called for definition of the type and level of detail needed for data on a local, national, regional, and global level to enable preparation for the next SARS-CoV-2 variant and future pandemic threats.

The US study, conducted by Kaiser Permanente Southern California and Pfizer researchers, estimated the effectiveness and duration of 2 and 3 doses of Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine against delta and omicron infections among adult Californians from 1 Dec 2021-6 Feb 2022. The study was published in The Lancet Respiratory Medicine [https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanres/article/PIIS2213-2600(22)00101-1/fulltext#%20].

The analysis included 11 123 hospital admissions and ED visits. Effectiveness of 2 doses of the Pfizer vaccine against omicron was 41% against hospitalization and 31% against an ED visit at least 9 months after the 2nd dose.

After 3 doses, effectiveness against omicron hospitalization rose to 85% within 3 months but declined to 55% afterward. Similarly, effectiveness against omicron ED admission was 77% within 3 months but dropped to 53% thereafter.

"Trends in waning against SARS-CoV-2 outcomes due to the delta variant were generally similar, but with higher effectiveness estimates at each timepoint than those seen for the omicron variant," the authors wrote.

In a Kaiser Permanente news release [https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/950427], lead author Sara Tartof, PhD, said that while 3 doses of vaccine were substantially more effective than 2 doses against omicron, they were less effective against omicron than against delta or other SARS-CoV-2 strains.

"Additional doses of current, adapted, or novel COVID-19 vaccines may be needed to maintain high levels of protection against subsequent waves of COVID-19 caused by omicron or future variants with similar potential to escape protection," she said.

As China battles an omicron-fueled COVID-19 outbreak in Shanghai, its largest city, it is also now seeing cases rise in Beijing, its capital and home to more than 21 million people.

Meanwhile, in the United States, COVID-19 activity, mainly due to the more transmissible BA.2 subvariant, are rising, mainly in 2 regions.

Officials in Beijing have ordered mass testing for people in the Chaoyang district, triggering stockpiling of groceries and other key items, as people fear a lockdown similar to Shanghai's, according to Reuters [https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN2MH09L].

China hasn't backed down from its "zero COVID" policy, even as Shanghai's lockdown stretches into a month and as cases -- and now deaths -- continue to rise. Lockdowns have frayed residents' morale, been a drag on China's economy, and stretched global supply chains.

Today [25 Apr 2022], China reported 20 194 new local cases, 17 728 of them asymptomatic, according to the country's National Health Commission. Most were from Shanghai, but 14 symptomatic and 5 asymptomatic cases were from Beijing [http://en.nhc.gov.cn/2022-04/25/c_85930.htm].

Deaths, typically a lagging indicator, continue to rise steadily, and China today reported 51 deaths, all from Shanghai. Fatalities are at their highest level since April 2020.

Daily COVID-19 case counts in the United States are up 51% in the last 2 weeks, with 46 992 new cases reported yesterday, according to the New York Times. Cases are rising most rapidly in the Midwest and the Northeast.

Cases have been rising due to the emergence of the BA.2 subvariant, now the dominant strain in the United States. The Health and Human Services Protect Public Data Hub shows 15 642 inpatient beds in use for COVID-19.

The Biden administration is moving to raise awareness of the antiviral treatment Paxlovid and taking steps to make it easier for people to access, the Associated Press reports [https://apnews.com/article/biden-covid-business-health-medication-fa6cd0dcc9dec4d1076b14a521e9a6e5].

The United States has ordered enough pills for 20 million people. In a related development, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a Health Alert Network notice, updating clinicians on the availability and use of treatments for mild to moderately sick patients at increased risk for severe outcomes [https://emergency.cdc.gov/han/2022/han00463.asp].

The pills, which were approved in December [2021], reduce hospitalizations and deaths 90% among patients most likely to get severe COVID-19. The administration is working to strengthen a pharmacy channel, which would see the pills dispensed in a test-to-treat model at commercial pharmacies across the country.

A 7-day series of cumulative data reported by countries, territories, and reporting entities can be found at https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/2022%20APR25WORLD7_1651005421.pdf. - Mod.UBA]

[In the past 24 hours, 10 countries including Germany (86 980), South Korea (80 301), the USA (71 115), Japan (66 945), the UK (44 992), Australia (40 301), Italy (25 282), France (13 984), Thailand (13 816), and Argentina (11 307) reported the highest numbers of cases, all reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases. A global total of 2410 deaths were reported in the preceding 24 hours (late 23 Apr 2022 to late 24 Apr 2022).

A total of 32 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 18 of the 32 countries are from the European region, 5 are from the Americas region, 1 is from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 6 are from the Western Pacific region, 2 are from the South East Asia region, and none are from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased by 20.1%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 13.2%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 26.2% increase in daily reported cases and 19.7% decrease in reported deaths. An overall global trend of decreasing cases (US has shown an increasing cases trend over the last few days) and reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily reported over 0.55 million newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours with over 510.09 million cumulative reported cases and over 6.24 million reported deaths. - Mod.UBA]
