[1] CDC update

CDC is collaborating with public health officials in several states,
including Colorado, and the FDA to investigate a multistate outbreak
of listeriosis. Listeriosis is a serious infection usually caused by
eating food contaminated with the bacterium _Listeria monocytogenes_.
Investigators are using DNA analysis of Listeria isolated from
patients to identify cases of illness that may be part of this
outbreak. The Listeria bacteria are obtained from diagnostic testing;
pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) is used to determine DNA
fingerprint patterns. Investigators are using data from PulseNet, the
national subtyping network made up of state and local public health
laboratories and federal food regulatory laboratories that performs
molecular surveillance of foodborne infections.

A total of 35 persons infected with the outbreak-associated strains of
_Listeria monocytogenes_ have been reported from 10 states. All
illnesses started on or after 4 Aug 2011. The number of infected
persons identified in each state is as follows: California (1),
Colorado (12), Illinois (1), Indiana (1), Montana (1), Nebraska (4),
New Mexico (5), Oklahoma (6), Texas (3), and West Virginia (1).
Listeriosis illnesses in several other states are currently being
investigated by state and local health departments to determine
whether they are part of this outbreak.

The ages of those infected range from 35 to 96 years, with a median
age of 81 years old. Most ill persons are over 60 years old or have
health conditions that weaken the immune system. 65 percent of ill
persons are female. Among the 28 ill persons with available
information on whether they were hospitalized, all were hospitalized.
Four deaths have been reported: one in Colorado, one in Oklahoma, and
2 in New Mexico.

About 800 cases of Listeria infection are diagnosed each year in the
USA, along with 3 or 4 outbreaks of Listeria-associated foodborne
illness. The foods that typically cause these outbreaks have been deli
meats, hot dogs, and Mexican-style soft cheeses made with
unpasteurized milk. Produce is not often identified as a source, but
sprouts caused an outbreak in 2009, and celery caused an outbreak in
2010.

Investigation of the outbreak
-----------------------
Ongoing collaborative investigations by local, state, and federal
public health and regulatory agencies indicate the source of the
outbreak is cantaloupe. Among the 27 ill persons with available
information on what they ate, 26 (96 percent) reported consuming
cantaloupes. Ill persons were interviewed about exposures during the
month before they became ill; investigators compared their responses
to persons with listeriosis reported through the CDC Listeria
Initiative, whose illnesses were not part of this outbreak. Several
ill persons remembered the type of cantaloupe they had eaten and said
they were Rocky Ford cantaloupes, which are grown in the Rocky Ford
region of southeastern Colorado. Source tracing of the cantaloupes
that ill persons ate indicated that they came from Jensen Farms, of
Granada, Colorado and were marketed as being from the Rocky Ford
region. These cantaloupes were harvested in August and September 2011,
were distributed widely in the USA, and may still be available in
grocery stores.

Laboratory testing by the Colorado Department of Public Health and
Environment identified _Listeria monocytogenes_ bacteria on
cantaloupes collected from grocery stores and from an ill person's
home. Product traceback information from Colorado state officials
indicated these cantaloupes also came from Jensen Farms. FDA is
working closely with CDC, the firms involved, and public health
authorities in states where illnesses occurred to determine the exact
cause of contamination.

CDC advises persons throughout the mainland United States who are at
high risk for listeriosis, including older adults, persons with
weakened immune systems, and pregnant women, to not eat Rocky Ford
cantaloupes from Jensen Farms. Other consumers who want to reduce
their risk of Listeria infection should not eat Rocky Ford cantaloupes
from Jensen Farms.

Recall
----
On 14 Sep 2011, FDA issued a press release to announce that Jensen
Farms issued a voluntary recall of Rocky Ford Cantaloupes because the
cantaloupes have the potential to be contaminated with Listeria and
may be linked to a multi-state outbreak of listeriosis.

Advice to consumers
----------------
Contaminated cantaloupes may still be in grocery stores and in
consumers' homes.

CDC recommends that persons at high risk for listeriosis, including
older adults, persons with weakened immune systems, and pregnant
women, do not eat Rocky Ford cantaloupes from Jensen Farms. Even if
some of the cantaloupe has been eaten without anyone becoming ill, the
rest of the cantaloupe should be disposed of immediately. Listeria
bacteria can grow in the cantaloupe at room and refrigerator
temperatures. Other consumers who want to reduce their risk of
Listeria infection should not eat Rocky Ford cantaloupes from Jensen
Farms.

The recalled cantaloupes may have a sticker [See:
http://www.fda.gov/Safety/Recalls/ucm271882.htm. - Mod.LL]. Not all
of the recalled cantaloupes are labeled with a sticker. Consumers
should consult the retailer if they have questions about the origin of
a cantaloupe.

Consumers and food preparers should wash their hands before and after
handling any whole melon, such as cantaloupe, watermelon, or honeydew.

- Wash the melons and dry them with a clean cloth or paper towel
before cutting.
- Cut melon should be promptly consumed or refrigerated at or less
than 40 F (32-34 F is best) for no more than 7 days.
- Cut melons left at room temperature for more than 4 hours should be
discarded.

[The number of affected individuals has grown from 22 to 35 in the 5
days between CDC postings on the outbreak, and 3 more states have
reported outbreak cases. As noted in this post and below, a "smoking"
melon has been found which microbiologically confirms the
epidemiological data - Mod.LL]

Laboratory results of samples obtained by the Colorado Department of
Public Health and Environment's state lab have confirmed a direct link
between human cases in the Listeria outbreak and cantaloupe labeled as
"Rocky Fords" from Jensen Farms in Holly.

Cantaloupe samples from the refrigerator of a Listeria patient's home,
as well as samples obtained from various retail outlets last week,
have the same DNA fingerprints as the Listeria that has infected 12
Colorado residents. All of the Listeria-positive cantaloupe samples at
this time appear to have been grown at Jensen Farms.

Dr. Chris Urbina, chief medical officer and executive director of the
department, reiterated to consumers that: "Individuals who are high
risk for listeriosis should not eat cantaloupe if they know it is from
Jensen Farms or if they don't know where the cantaloupe they purchased
is from." Urbina said high-risk individuals for listeriosis are people
aged 60 and older; those with weakened immune systems from transplants
or certain chronic diseases, immunosuppressive therapies or
medications; and pregnant women. Healthy adults under age 60 rarely
develop this illness.

On Wed 14 Sep 2011, Jensen Farms voluntarily recalled its cantaloupe,
shipped between 29 Jul 2011 and 10 Sep 2011, which was distributed to
at least 17 states with possible further distribution. An FDA news
release issued Wednesday [14 Sep 2011] night said that although the
investigation is ongoing, no other cantaloupe producer has been
implicated.

Although these cantaloupes have been, and are being, removed from
commerce, additional infections likely will be reported, because it
takes an average of 3 weeks to become ill with listeriosis after
eating a contaminated product. Ten samples collected from cantaloupes
identified as being from Jensen Farms all came back positive for
_Listeria monocytogenes_. Several samples matched the lab results of
Colorado's 12 confirmed human cases. The state health department
continues to work with FDA and CDC to determine the source of the
cantaloupe contamination.

[The vehicle for _L. monocytogenes_ in this substantial outbreak is
unusual, so ProMED awaits more information regarding the source of the
contamination. Since the melon grows on a vine on the ground, its rind
can become contaminated with pathogens by contact with contaminated
soil, fertilizer, or water used for irrigation or washing.
Contamination could also occur later during the process of bringing
the food from field to table. Cutting through the outer skin can then
contaminate the pulp of cantaloupe, if washing of the outside is
inadequate. It is, therefore, important to wash the melon thoroughly
before cutting into it, since bacteria can grow on the rind. However,
because Listeria reproduce at refrigerator temperatures, inoculation
of the pulp by even low numbers of the organism can result in higher
grade contamination of refrigerated product. There is also increasing
data to suggest that some enteric pathogens (such as _E. coli_ O157:H7
or _Salmonella enterica_ serotypes) could persist internally in the
growing plant if introduced to the seed or early growing phases.

_Listeria monocytogenes_ is widely distributed in nature. The
organism can be found in soil, water, silage, raw vegetables, raw meat
and poultry, raw milk, soft cheeses, kitchen premises, and in the
intestinal tract of many animals, including cattle, sheep, and humans,
and in crustaceans, fish, shellfish, ticks, and insects. Most human
infections are foodborne, although vertical transmission can occur
from mother to fetus transplacentally or during delivery through an
infected birth canal, and localized skin infections can occur in
veterinarians and farmers by direct contact with infected animals. -
