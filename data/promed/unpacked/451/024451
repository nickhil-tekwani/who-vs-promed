Canadian _E. coli_ Outbreak Kills 4, Infects 500
An infant and three elderly people died, 20 others have been hospitalized
and 500 more may be infected in Canada's worst outbreak of _E. coli_ [O157
infections, health officials said on Wednesday.
Authorities said the outbreak in Walkerton, Ontario, a town of about 5000
people about 125 miles northwest of Toronto, had reached "epidemic
proportions."
McQuigge said an infant and an 82-year-old woman died on Wednesday and at
least half of the 20 people admitted to hospitals were in critical
condition. Two other elderly people, one a Walkerton woman, also died on
Wednesday local hospital officials said, but few details were being released.
Eight children were being treated at Children's Hospital of Western
Ontario, in London, said Julie Troyano, a hospital spokeswoman.
Five investigators from the Ontario Ministry of Environment were
investigating the cause of the outbreak. "We want to make sure we have all
the answers before we jump the gun on anything," said Dan Newman, the
province of Ontario's environment minister. "I don't think we ought to be
pointing fingers at anyone or anything at this time but focus on the people
of Walkerton," Newman told a news conference. He said the investigators
would release their conclusions "shortly" but did not elaborate.
Meanwhile, Walkerton residents were being told not to even wash their hands
unless the water was boiled or treated with chlorine. "We are not going to
lift the water advisory until the environment ministry assures us that
everything is okay," McQuigge [said.
"The concern is seven to 10 per cent of people with _E. coli_ 0157 may
develop kidney complications about nine days after," McQuigge said. "This
is especially a concern in the very young and the elderly. There is a death
rate of 1 to 3 percent."
McQuigge added: "We are saying do not use antibiotics to treat these cases.
Preliminary evidence shows that using antibiotics to treat _E. coli_ can
cause kidney failure."
