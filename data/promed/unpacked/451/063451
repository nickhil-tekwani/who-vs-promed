An outbreak of a yam disease that is likely to cause food insecurity
has been reported in Anambra and Enugu states. The outbreak of
disease, which is assessed to be capable of drastically crippling the
yam industry with the likelihood of extending to other crops, was
announced at the National Root Crops Research Institute (NRCRI) by
the South East zonal coordinator of its Research Extension Farmer
Input Linkage System (REFILS), Dr. Anselm Udealor.

This led to on-the-spot investigation by a team of NRCRI plant
protection scientists, who later confirmed the disease. Investigation
reports on the soil and yam samples concluded that the yam disease
was anthracnose of white yam, a fungal disease usually referred to as
yam dieback, with the causative organism described as the fungus
_Glomerella cingulata_.

The yam programme coordinator, Dr John Ikeorgu, disclosed that "this
disease had been reported to occur in 92 percent of the 958 yam
fields surveyed in 1992. It occurred across the Nigerian yam belt and
caused early senescence of leaves and consequent reduction in tuber
yield. It spreads from older leaves upwards, and sometimes multiple
infections occur of young or recently matured leaves."

Ikeorgu added, "The infection may have come from the planting
material. A farmer must have purchased infected seed yams, and
neigbouring farms must have been quickly infected by the pathogen,
whose spread is greatly enhanced by high rainfall and humidity. Owing
to the increased population pressure, the yam farmland, which was
formerly left fallow for 5 to 10 years to regenerate, is now hardly
fallowed for 3 years before re-cropping with another crop of yam.
Under this scenario, the pathogens on previously used yam vines must
have multiplied to re-infect the incoming yam crop. It is likely that
many of the farms where the disease occurred were planted late when
the rains are heavy, accentuating the severity of the disease."

Describing the yam disease as a likely new epidemic with the
possibility of spreading fast, the NRCRI Executive Director/Chief
Executive Officer, Dr Kenneth Nwosu said that it is not yet endemic,
although it was found more in the traditional yam varieties. "We
shall queue it into this year's project programme," he disclosed,
"and use laboratory methods to manage it and reduce its spread. It
has not become a national problem. We have not heard much of it in
Abia, Akwa Ibom and Cross River states. We try to manage it at this
level to ensure it does not extend beyond Anambra and Enugu States."

Asked what farmers should do in this planting season, especially
those in the affected 2 states, Dr Nwosu said: "Farmers should plant
fresh seed yams, which they can procure from the ADPs or from us at
NRCRI at very low prices. If they continue planting the old material,
they will be recycling and spreading the disease." He said the
institute has 7 new hybrid yam varieties that are resistant to this
disease and enough to meet the farmers' demand. He advised that the
surest thing to do is to discard old yams for new varieties. To the
government, he pleaded that more money be made available for the
rapid multiplication of improved seed yams, adding that NRCRI has
developed a system of inducing seed germination and for the planting
of yams successfully twice a year, provided there is water.

Ikeorgu advised farmers to be mindful of site selection, selection of
clean seed tubers of cultivars known to be high yielding and
relatively pest and disease resistant, weeding the farms, ensuring
that they plant the yams before the soil is too wet, as well as
observing all the other husbandry practices such as applying
fertilizer at recommended rates.

[Anthracnose is one of the most serious epiphytotic diseases of yams,
especially _Dioscorea rotundata_ and _D. alata_, in Nigeria and other
West African areas, and is a limiting factor for production of these
crops worldwide. It is caused by the fungus _Glomerella cingulata_
(synonym _Colletotrichum gloeosporioides_). The related species _C.
truncatum_ may also be present in infected tissue, but its role in
anthracnose etiology remains unclear. The disease affects leaves,
vines and tubers. Symptoms include rapidly expanding brown/black
lesions, necrosis, defoliation and dieback of the entire plant,
orange-brown tuber rots, and small blisters on the tuber surface.
Reduced photosynthesis leads to undersized yams. The fungus is spread
mainly by infected plant material, seed tubers, mechanical means and
splashing rain. Use of clean planting material, cultural techniques
and resistant varieties are the primary means of disease management.
Fungicides can delay the onset of epidemics but usually cannot
prevent their development during the rainy season.

_G. cingulata_ and related species have been reported to cause
anthracnose-like symptoms on many crops. These fungi have generally a
long saprophytic survival ability on crop residues, and this is why
in the report above a decrease in the fallow period between yam crops
is thought to have contributed to the current epidemic.
