Bozeman animal control says that there is a confirmed outbreak of a viral disease hitting the raccoon population in the Bozeman area. According to the Bozeman Police Department, animal control has responded to approximately 20 cases of sick raccoons in the city limits, an "unusually high" number.

Testing confirmed the raccoons had canine distemper, a contagious viral disease that affects dogs and wildlife such as raccoons, wolves, foxes and skunks. There have also been a number of dead foxes reported in the Bozeman area. However, an outbreak in that population has not been tested or confirmed.

Distemper can be transmitted by the transfer of bodily fluids from animal to animal, so Bozeman animal control captures and removes these raccoons whenever possible. The second type of distemper, feline distemper, was not found in any of the raccoons. Neither type of distemper is transmittable to human beings, so people are not at risk of infection.

Symptoms of a raccoon with distemper typically includes lethargy, seizures and disorientation. The raccoons are also often seen out during the day, an abnormal habit for raccoons.

[Canine distemper virus is the pathogen most frequently causing outbreaks at the carnivore wildlife-domestic interface. As distemper and rabies affect the central nervous system, they both cause behavioral disorders.

In raccoons, distemper usually results in neurological signs such as stumbling and lack of 'shyness', they can seem 'dumb' and/or 'friendly'. Rabid raccoons also might lose their fear to humans and other animals, and they may become slower and are brought into stupor, but they present profuse salivation, indiscriminate biting, and odd vocalization.

It is very important to make sure to keep the vaccination schemes of all domestic carnivores in the area up to date, including both rabies and distemper. A map of the affected area can be accessed at http://healthmap.org/r/awKH. - Mod.PMB
