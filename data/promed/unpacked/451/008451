A recent report from the Netherlands in Emerging Infectious Diseases (van Dijk et al 2018; [see commentary below]) describes a new twist on raw feeding concerns, _Brucella suis_ infection. Here's the short version of the story:

A dog in the Netherlands developed fever, ascites (fluid free in the abdomen), and inflammation of the testicles. After failing to respond to antibiotics, it was taken to surgery to be neutered. In the process, culture samples were collected from the epididymis (tissue adjacent to the testicle) and from the abdominal fluid. _B. suis_ was identified in both samples, which presumably caused a bit stir in the lab and the clinic since this bacterium is rarely identified, can also infect people and is federally notifiable in the Netherlands (that is, the government has to be contacted when it's found). Ultimately, the dog was euthanized after failing to respond to further treatment.

Because this is a notifiable disease, there was an investigation. The dog did not have any of the typical exposures that would increase the risk of _Brucella_ infection, such as contact with wildlife or livestock, breeding, or travel to brucellosis-endemic areas. The dog's raw, rabbit-based diet that was imported from Argentina therefore became the leading suspected source. _B. suis_ was ultimately identified in samples from a 30 000 kg batch of raw rabbit imported from Argentina, a country where _B. suis_ is present.

It's a single case report so we can't get too worked up about it, but it's noteworthy for a couple reasons:

Reason 1 is the disease -- brucellosis is a nasty. It can be hard to treat, is potentially zoonotic, and sometimes results in public health-mandated euthanasia of the dog.

Reason 2 is the importation aspect. The dog wasn't imported but the bacterium was, via food. We're trying to increase awareness of the need to query travel and importation history in pets, as it can significantly impact disease risks. Querying diet origins is even tougher. While most people know where their dog has been in the past few weeks, they may not know much about where their dog's diet has been. With commercial processed food, it's not a big deal, but with higher-risk food like raw meat, importing food can be similar to the dog visiting the country of origin, from a disease standpoint. With raw meat, knowing where the meat came from and the disease risks in those areas may be important, but often not easy to find out.

The incidence of disease in dogs and cats associated with raw meat feeding isn't clear, and is probably low. Nevertheless, I recommend avoiding raw meat feeding, especially in high risk households (such as those with elderly individuals, kids less than 5 years of age, pregnant women, or immunocompromised individuals). However, if raw meat is to be fed, some basic precautions can used to help reduce the risks. For details, see the raw meat infosheet on the Worms & Germs Resources - Pets page (https://www.wormsandgermsblog.com/files/2008/04/M2-Raw-Meat-Owner1.pdf).

Abstract
--------
"A _Brucella suis_ biovar 1 infection was diagnosed in a dog without typical exposure risks, but the dog had been fed a raw meat-based diet (hare carcasses imported from Argentina). Track and trace investigations revealed that the most likely source of infection was the dog's raw meat diet".

Subscribers may be interested in the following excerpts from the paper's discussion section (references omitted):

"Medical microbiologists of the Municipal Health Service assessed the zoonotic risks for all persons who had come in contact with the dog or with samples from the dog or hare carcasses. 5 laboratory technicians who had been exposed to pure cultures (before bacterial identification) were given post-exposure prophylaxis and tested for seroconversion to _B. suis_ (post-exposure weeks 2, 4, 6, and 24) according to national guidelines. To our knowledge, no human infections were linked to this case.

"_B. suis_ biovar 1 is a potential threat to the pig farming industry because introduction of _B. suis_ into pig herds can have substantial economic consequences. A striking detail is that the last _B. suis_ infection in pigs in the Netherlands (1969) was associated with swill feeding of hares imported from Argentina.

"In response to our findings, preventive measures were implemented (such as, sampling of imported raw meat and communication of risk to international authorities and raw-feed suppliers). This case stresses the microbiological risks for humans and animals of feeding raw meat-based diets, which has become increasingly popular among pet owners. This case also highlights the need for a One Health approach because _B. suis_ biovar 1 is a zoonotic agent and can cause severe infections in humans." Mod.AS
