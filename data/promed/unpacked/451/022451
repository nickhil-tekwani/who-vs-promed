Iran: Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever update: 1 Jan to 23 Aug 2005
---------------------------------------------
The following is the latest updated report on Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic
fever (CCHF) in Iran, from the Arboviruses and Viral Haemorrhagic Fevers
Laboratory (National Center) of Pasteur Institute of Iran, in Tehran. This
supplements our last report, posted on ProMED-mail on Sat 5 Feb 2005 as
"Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, 2004 - Iran 20050205.0397".
For the period of 1 Jan to 23 Aug 2005, the total number of suspected cases
for CCHF was 65. Among the 65 suspected cases from different provinces of
Iran, we found 8 IgM positive, RT-PCR positive cases (one fatality), one
IgM positive, RT-PCR negative case (the serum sample had been collected
late hence the RT-PCR result was negative), and 4 IgM negative, RT-PCR
positive cases (all 4 patients suffered fulminates illnesses and died
before they could develop any immune responses). So we had a total of 13
(8+1+4) confirmed cases with five (4+1) deaths among the confirmed cases.
It should be mentioned that for some of the biological reagents used in
serological survey, such as antigens and immune ascitis, we have had
scientific assistance from the Pasteur Institutes of Paris and Dakar. (The
recombinant antigen used in ELISA tests has been produced as a scientific
collaboration between our lab and the _Bunyaviridae_ Molecular Genetics
Unit of the Pasteur Institute of Paris). And also, for different aspects of
our molecular survey, we have had scientific collaborations with the
Swedish Institute for Infectious Disease Control, the Canadian Science
Center for Human and Animal Health (Winnipeg, Canada), and the University
of Texas Medical Branch (Galveston).

[ProMED-mail appreciates Dr Chinikar's cooperation in providing these
regular reports on the prevalence of CCHF in Iran. During the corresponding
period in 2004 (1 Jan to 22 Aug 2004) the total number of suspected cases
was 53. Among the 53 suspected cases from different provinces of Iran there
were 12 IgM antibody positive and 8 RT-PCR positive, and one death among
confirmed cases. Therefore there has been a slight increase in suspected
case numbers and an increase in deaths in confirmed cases this year. Dr
Chinikar's final report for 2004 (received in February 2005) indicated that
during 2004 a total of 82 suspected cases were recorded; 22 IgM positive
cases, 15 RT-PCR positive cases and 5 deaths among confirmed cases. - Mod.CP]
