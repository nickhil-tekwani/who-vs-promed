State veterinarian Dustin Oedekoven has confirmed the disease was diagnosed in a group of 300 unvaccinated yearling cattle in Butte County, in western South Dakota. Butte is the 4th county where anthrax has been diagnosed in 2018, following Clark, Bon Homme and Hamlin counties.

Anthrax spores can survive indefinitely in contaminated soil, and the potential for outbreaks exists across South Dakota. Drought, floods and winds can expose anthrax spores to livestock.

Anthrax can cause the rapid loss of a large number of animals in a short time. Infected livestock often are found dead with no illness detected. Producers across South Dakota should consult their veterinaries and vaccinate livestock, if appropriate.

[Butte county is on the northern western border of South Dakota (SD), distant from the Clarke and Hamlin outbreaks in eastern SD ( a traditional area for anthrax outbreaks) and the Bon Homme outbreak on the eastern southern border with Nebraska. see: http://legacy.lib.utexas.edu/maps/united_states/southdakota_90.jpg.

In the two Dakotas we have reached that stage of sitting out the mortality of anthrax soil spores while patiently vaccinating each year until these sporadic outbreaks stop. As in the usual Dakotan pattern these yearling livestock had not been vaccinated, and so were at risk. As some 300 animals were described to have been at risk, it is safe to assume that there may have been multiple cases and deaths, and therefore a significant recontamination of the ranch soil. An added procrastination cost of not having vaccinated. - Mod.MHJ
