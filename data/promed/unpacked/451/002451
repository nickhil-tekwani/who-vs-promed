An "aggressive" species of dengue [virus]-carrying mosquito has been
found in Queensland, with concerns it could bring the disease to
southern parts of the state. Larvae of the Asian tiger mosquito,
_Aedes albopictus_ were discovered in the tiny Cape York town of New
Mapoon this week. Health authorities say it has the ability to carry
dengue, a blood-borne virus that can be fatal in some cases. The
mosquito can also transmit yellow fever [virus].

Queensland's Chief Health Officer Jeannette Young said more concerning
was its ability to survive in cooler climates and the potential for it
to establish itself in the state's south-east, including Brisbane.
Until now, dengue fever has been confined to only tropical regions in
the north. "The Asian tiger mosquito has the potential to transmit
dengue [virus], but is not as effective a carrier as the _Aedes
aegypti_ mosquito, which is already established in northern and
central Queensland," Dr Young said. "However, we do have some concerns
about its spread as it survives at cooler temperatures than _Ae.
aegypti_, so it could become established further south."

[Earlier] this year, Queensland experienced its worst dengue outbreak
in 50 years, with more than 1000 people infected and one woman killed.
The spread throughout regional cities including Cairns and Townsville
was so rampant, experts held a dengue summit, summoning experts from
all over the world.

Queensland Health says none of the larvae found in New Mapoon tested
positive for dengue, and population health experts say the likelihood
the Asian tiger mosquito had already spread south was slim, as Cape
York is still in dry season. [Dengue virus would be expected to be
found in adult mosquitoes, rather than larvae. - Mod. TY]

_Aedes albopictus_ was 1st found in the Torres Strait in 2005,
however, this is the 1st time it has been discovered on Australia's
mainland [not so; see comment below]. Dr Young said Queensland Health
would work with local and federal authorities on a control program to
deal with the Asian tiger mosquito and limit its spread. She said
potential breeding sites would be removed "and the community warned
about mosquito control methods."

Further investigations into how large the population is on Cape York
cannot begin until it receives decent rainfall and the mosquito's eggs
become detectable. The Asian tiger mosquito prefers fresh water and
breeds in similar conditions to the _Ae. aegypti_, in natural
containers in the bush, including cut bamboo, banana trees and coconut
shells.

"_Ae. albopictus_ mosquitoes are considered to be aggressive invaders
and more cold-tolerant than _Ae. aegypti_ mosquitoes, so may therefore
spread more easily throughout Australia," according to Queensland
Health advice. "_Ae. albopictus_ mosquitoes can carry dengue fever,
yellow fever and other arborviruses."

[The 1st reports of _Ae. albopictus_ mosquitoes on the mainland were
in 1999 in Darwin in northernmost Northern Territory, imported in a
shipment of mining equipment from Indonesian West Timor, and Sydney,
in New South Wales, way to the south, imported in a shipment of tires
from Japan -- see ProMED refs. for 1999 & 2000 below.

Dengue virus is again (November 2009) being transmitted locally in 2
instances in northern Queensland (see ProMED archive number
20091201.4109), so concern about _Ae. albopictus_ becoming an
additional dengue virus vector is real. It is curious that the risk of
introduction of chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and transmission by _Aedes
albopictus_ was not mentioned in this report, given the introduction
of this virus into Italy triggering an outbreak with transmission by
_Ae. albopictus_ in 2007. CHIKV was introduced by an infected traveler
coming from India, where an outbreak was ongoing at the time (see
ProMED archive number 20071031.3534, below). Even this year (2009)
CHIKV infected travelers coming from Sri Lanka and Singapore arrived
in Italy and France, but apparently without ongoing virus
transmission. However, there would be an open question about whether
the adaptation of CHIKV and _Ae. albopictus_ in Australia would be
sufficient to provide efficient transmission.

Professor EA Gould provided an interesting commentary emphasizing the
importance of adaptation of CHIKV to _Ae. albopictus_, with the risk
of wide geographic spread to areas where this mosquito has become
established (see ProMED-mail archive number 20080910.2829). Given the
extensive travel between CHIK virus-endemic countries in South and
Southeast Asia with Australia, the risk of importation and spread of
CHIKV into northern Queensland seems substantially greater than does
yellow fever (YF) virus introduction coming from isolated jungle YF
cases in South America or Africa.
