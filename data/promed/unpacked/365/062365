The death toll in a suspected case of food poisoning in Dahod district's Bhulwan village went up to 8 on Wednesday [15 Dec 2021], with one more person succumbing during treatment. Seven of the 17 affected persons died by Tuesday [14 Dec 2021] after allegedly consuming a meal from the concluding ceremony of a 9-day religious event in Bhulwan village on Sunday [12 Dec 2021]. While 4 persons died late on the next day [13 Dec 2021], 3 succumbed Tuesday evening [14 Dec 2021].

According to police, the villagers participated in sacrificing goats at the concluding ceremony of "Jatar" gathering, which is a 9-day religious event held every 5 years to pray for the well-being of the village. Police said that the local residents, as per tradition, sacrificed 6 goats, and the cooked meat was distributed among people of the village as "prasad." A total of 17 persons, all male, were admitted to the hospital through Tuesday [14 Dec 2021], police added.

Dahod Superintendent of Police Hitesh Joysar told The Indian Express that the 1st autopsy report of the 4 deceased persons on Tuesday [14 Dec 2021] had indicated death due to poisoning, but the police will collect forensic evidence. "We have collected the samples today and will send them to the FSL. The primary cause of death is poisoning, but a detailed histopathology report will confirm the cause," Joysar said.

[The incubation period between the meal and the onset of symptoms is not stated, and no symptom complex is provided. The goat meat is implicated, but it is not known what else was ingested. With a case fatality of rate of almost 50%, a poisoning rather than an infection or biological intoxication is likely to be the cause. - Mod.LL
