encephalitis - India (North): RFI 20010827.2033]
Director general of the Indian Council of Medical Research Nirmal Kumar
Ganguli's announcement that the Siliguri outbreak was caused by a measles
variant was contradicted by researchers at the Delhi-based National
Institute of Communicable Diseases.
"6 Siliguri samples were sent to [the US] Centers of Disease Control, and
they turned out to be of Nipah virus," Biraj Mohan Das, director of
emergency medical services in India's health ministry, told the BMJ. But
researchers at the national institute feel that the issue is still
unresolved. "It very well could be a new virus, although we tend to think
it is close to Nipah virus," a senior scientist told the BMJ.
But the institute's work on the Siliguri virus is at a standstill, as
neither the institute nor any other Indian facility has the right level of
biosafety needed to handle dangerous pathogens. "Such a facility is surely
needed in a country of India's size, and the World Health Organization
would extend any technical assistance India would need in this regard,"
said Tej Walia, WHO representative to India.

[We believe that this is the first official announcement that a Nipah-like
virus was identified in India. The Bangladesh Government confirmed that a
Nipah-like virus was present in a nearby border region (Chandpur, Sadar
thana, Meherpur District) [Nipah-like virus - Bangladesh (2001)
20020830.5187]. At the time of the outbreak in Bangladesh, it was felt to
be linked to the outbreak in Siliguri, but until now there has not been
confirmation of identification of a Nipah-like virus from the outbreak in
Siliguri India. More information on the laboratory findings from the
Siliguri outbreak would be appreciated. Probably the Indian subcontinent
viruses will differ to some extent from the Malaysian (Nipah) and
Australian (Hendra) viruses. These 2 viruses are unrelated to previously
characterized paramyxoviruses; they are similar but not identical and are
now classified as species within a new genus designated _Henipavirus_. -
