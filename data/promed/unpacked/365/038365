In Cote d'Ivoire, swollen shoot disease is worsening in the cocoa belt in the central region. "That really worries us because around 2010-11, I had harvested 4 tons each year. This year [2018], I am at 1.8 tons," said [a farmer], who owns 5 ha [about 12.4 acres]. The disease's level boomed in recent years, dropping production. According to an exporter, while the decline in production in the central region was offset by higher output in protected forest areas, the government's recent crackdown on illegal cocoa cultivation would affect the harvest volume.

Authorities said 6 viral strains were identified between 2014 and 2017 [in the country]. The Coffee-Cocoa Council (CCC) announced last January [2018] a program to uproot 300 000 hectares [about 741 300 acres] of infected trees over the next 3 years to help control the outbreak. First identified in Ghana in 1936, the virus was detected in Cote d'Ivoire in Bouafle, Sinfra, and Oume.

[Swollen shoot disease of cocoa (CSSD) caused by species of genus _Badnavirus_ can lead to severe crop losses. The viruses are thought to have been transferred to cocoa from West African forest trees. Symptoms vary with different viral strains, from severe effects on shoots and roots resulting in serious dieback or even death of the tree, to no symptoms at all. The viruses are spread by several species of mealybugs (_Pseudococcidae_) and may also be transmitted by grafting and mechanical inoculation. Seed transmission is also suspected.

Disease management relies on phytosanitation and clean planting material. Most affected countries require the removal of all infected trees and their neighbours. Mealybugs are difficult to control and native forests serve as pathogen reservoirs. Keeping replanted trees from becoming reinfected would be challenging under local conditions, thus ongoing breeding programmes for virus- or vector-resistant crop varieties are crucial. Cross protection against severe viral strains by mild strains is also being trialled (see link below).

A westward spread of CSSD in Ghana led to a serious outbreak with more severe symptoms in 2008 (ProMED-mail post 20081030.3416) and the possibility of the involvement of a new viral strain was considered. Ghana, Togo, Nigeria, and Cote d'Ivoire signed an agreement to tackle the disease and subsequently molecular work has increased. The 3 badnaviruses currently recognised as cause of the disease are _Cacao swollen shoot virus_, _Cacao swollen shoot CD virus_, and _Cacao swollen shoot Togo A virus_. An additional proposed species, Cacao red vein virus (CRVV) was isolated from field samples (ProMED-mail post 20171025.5404488 and link below) and is suspected to be the causal agent of the rapid decline phenotype of CSSD. However, pathogenicity studies to prove infectivity of CRVV in the host (according to Koch's Postulates) are still to be carried out. Additional virus sequences were constructed by _in silico_ analysis of field samples collected in Cote d'Ivoire and Ghana (ProMED-mail post 20180409.5734172). Whether these are associated with intact virus particles and thus represent actual infectious viruses involved in CSSD _in vivo_ will need to be verified by pathogenicity and epidemiology studies.
