The follow information has been posted in the online edition of the Corriere della Sera daily newspaper:

Two patients have died, and another 3 affected by an unexplained condition. At the Tor Vergata Polyclinic a doctor has fallen ill [and died] during treatment of a patient. The Regional Health Authorities have established an investigation committee and will do everything to find out why he died in this manner. For the Director-General of the San Giovanni hospital, it has also became an obligation to establish why a liver transplantation performed at the Tor Vergata Polyclinic was accompanied by the death of a 64-year-old Hospital morgue attendant. The attendant's death happened on [11 Aug 2013] and the cause of death has still not been established. The [victim], with other morgue staff, performed a necroscopy on an elderly woman who had [died] unexpectedly during treatment for her cancer.

[From the translated extract, the cause of these deaths of medical staff at the San Giovanni hospital is still unresolved, but is suggestive of exposure to an infectious (possibly viral) agent. ProMED-mail would welcome further information concerning this incident and the results of the ongoing investigation. - Mod.CP
