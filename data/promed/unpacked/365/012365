Four people have died in the past few days in the Nuble province, Region
VIII, from what doctors believe is a resurgence of the hantavirus, a deadly
sickness [sic caused by the inhalation or ingestion of infected rat feces.
Nuble Health Service Director Doctor Jaime Reyes said that once the four
deaths are confirmed by the Public Heath Institute (ISP) as
hanta[virus-related, it will officially confirm the resurgence of the
disease. All four of the victims displayed symptoms characteristic of
hanta[virus disease: high fever, faintness and severe headaches.
Officials explain that this year's drought has meant that humans have more
contact with rodents, which tend to go closer to homes in search of food.
Reyes said the section of the Nuble province close to the mountains had
already been declared a high risk zone for hantavirus, especially because
the long-tailed rat, which transmits the disease, is a natural inhabitant
of the zone.
The health service said it is not necessary for people to change their
travel plans, and the fact that more than one million people visited
southern Chile [without being infected means that the risk of infection is
low if precautionary measures are taken.
