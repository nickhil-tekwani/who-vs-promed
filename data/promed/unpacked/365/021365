MOHAMMAD N. AKHTER, M.D., M.P.H.
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR
AMERICAN PUBLIC HEALTH ASSOCIATION
BEFORE THE SUBCOMMITTEE ON COMMERCE, JUSTICE, STATE, THE JUDICIARY, AND
RELATED AGENCIES, COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS, U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
REGARDING CONTRIBUTIONS TO INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS, THE WORLD HEALTH
ORGANIZATION (WHO) AND THE PAN AMERICAN HEALTH ORGANIZATION (PAHO)
APRIL 1, 1998
Mr. Chairman, members of the Committee, I am grateful for the opportunity to
appear before you today to urge the Committee to provide full funding for
the President's Fiscal Year 1999 request for the U.S. contribution to the
World Health Organization (WHO) and the Pan American Health Organization
(PAHO), organizations that are vital to protect Americas' health. They are
organizations that are truly in the national interest of the United States.
I am the Executive Director of the American Public Health Association,
representing thousands of health professionals in communities across the
United States. My testimony represents the views of APHA and other national
organizations that strongly endorse continued active U.S. participation in
WHO and PAHO, full funding of U.S. Fiscal Year 1999 assessments to them, and
the timely payment of outstanding arrears.
Mr. Chairman, WHO and PAHO play a very key role in protecting this country's
citizens against emerging infectious diseases and other costly health
threats. As Dr. David Satcher, the new U.S. Surgeon General, said in
testimony before Congress in early March, "addressing the threat of emerging
infectious diseases depends on international cooperation."
U.S. membership in WHO and PAHO and regular, full payment of U.S. dues is an
essential investment in the ongoing fight to identify and combat new health
threats, save the lives of children, prevent needless deaths, and even
protect U.S. citizens against the menace of biological weapons. These dues
payments are indeed one of the cheapest and most cost-effective investments
in U.S. public health.
We live in a world where diseases do not respect borders. We face the
worldwide challenge of monitoring, preventing and controlling infectious
diseases, with a common need for an effective global infrastructure, built
on country and regional capacity, to meet this challenge.
Success of International Collaboration
International collaboration has been the key to some of our most notable
successes in public health. Smallpox was eradicated from the world in 1980,
polio was eradicated from the Americas in 1991, and we are on our way to
eliminating measles from this Hemisphere. Half a dozen other diseases have
been targeted for eradication or elimination, and vaccines now protect about
eight out of 10 of the world's children against six killer diseases.
But optimism should not lead to complacency. International travel, the
movement across borders of goods, foodstuffs, and diseases, which don't need
passports, the emergence of new diseases and the re-emergence of old ones
that were once under control, along with ever more virulent forms of
disease, have combined to change the world.
Today, communicable diseases remain the major source of illness and death in
developing countries. Industrialized countries are becoming aware that they
too are at increasing risk from many infectious agents. Dr. Satcher
testified last month that between 1980 and 1992, the death rate in the
United States from infectious diseases, excluding HIV/AIDS, rose by 22
percent.
Collaboration on control of diseases was why the U.S. and other nations
created and joined international health organizations years before even the
League of Nations existed, and a key reason why the U.S. must continue its
collaboration with them. PAHO will soon be 100 years old and WHO is 50
years old this year.
WHO has universal membership of 191 nations, six more than the United
Nations itself. WHO and PAHO are irreplaceable as the global and regional
bodies that link together the health authorities of the Western Hemisphere
and of all 191 member nations of WHO. They also bring together and link the
top technical expertise from universities, research institutions,
professional associations, and nongovernmental bodies, in order to improve
health worldwide.
WHO and PAHO represent our best collaborative efforts in science, medicine,
public health, health promotion, research, and training. If we fail to
continue our support, lives are at stake, not just in other countries but
here in the United States.
Standards for Health and Medicine
Mr. Chairman, in addition to disease control, WHO and PAHO are critical to
establishing universal norms and standards related to health and medicine.
They are also essential to collecting, evaluating, and disseminating the
best information that science, medicine, and human ingenuity have developed
for cost-effective solutions of today's health problems all over the world.
In addition they assist governments and their private partners to tackle
other chronic and emergency health problems successfully.
In an era of expanding international trade and travel, U.S. interests
directly benefit from the maintenance of global norms and standards.
Without the work of these agencies on international norms and standards,
there would be no international classification of diseases or international
comparability in statistics on disease and disability. There would not be
common international names for pharmaceutical substances nor the
international quality control standards on which pharmaceutical firms from
the United States depend for success in overseas markets. There would not
be internationally-accepted safety and quality standards for hazardous
chemical exposure, safe drinking water, radiation exposure, food, vaccines,
laboratory procedures, blood safety, and other things that directly affect
human health.
Quick Availability of Health Expertise
Mobilization of the worldwide technical expertise of staff and health make
assistance available quickly where it can make a difference for health. For
example, each February information on currently circulating influenza
strains is summarized, drawing on WHO's worldwide influenza monitoring and
reporting network. Governments and vaccine manufacturers base the
formulation of annual flu vaccine on this vital information provided by WHO.
The meeting of international experts on the composition of the influenza
vaccine for the 1998-1999 season, recently held at the WHO headquarters in
Geneva, resulted in changes in two of the three influenza vaccine components
recommended last year. Very significantly, this continual surveillance
system had picked up in early 1997 in Hong Kong the first known human case
of A(H5N1) influenza, an avian strain not previously known to infect humans.
WHO was able to monitor the outbreak from its earliest days, working closely
with governmental authorities in Hong Kong and China and with many
institutions that serve as WHO and PAHO collaborating centers, including
U.S. centers at NIH, CDC, and other institutions including the WHO
Collaborating Center for Environmental Management for Vector Control at the
Tennessee Valley Authority and the WHO Collaborating Center for Studies on
the Ecology of Influenza in Animals at St. Jude Children's Hospital in
Memphis, Tennessee. Fortunately, at present there is no evidence of current
human infection with influenza A(H5N1) virus or evidence of spread beyond
the initial focus in Hong Kong. But the nature of the influenza virus,
which is constantly changing, means that an influenza pandemic of a new
strain such as the deadly flu epidemic of 1918, is a real and present danger
requiring constant worldwide vigilance.
Cost savings and successes
As these examples show, WHO and PAHO mobilize the highest quality
international scientific expertise at very low cost. There are twice as
many international experts who serve without salary on formal expert
advisory panels, such as the one on influenza, as there are professional
staff in WHO itself. There are also over 1100 WHO Collaborating Centers
around the world, 162 of them in the United States, that are committed to
lend their expertise in specific areas like diagnosing the Ebola virus or
working on a vaccine against influenza A(H5N1).
WHO and PAHO thus provide a cost-effective mechanism to link the knowledge
structures of worldwide medical science to health delivery in the field
through the local health authorities. Without the assistance of these
agencies in tackling actual emergency and chronic health problems on the
ground, recent epidemics like Hong Kong Avian flu, Rift Valley fever in
Africa, and dengue fever in the Americas would have been far more
devastating in lives and economic damage.
These agencies also lead the effort to set up worldwide surveillance systems
for emerging diseases and to monitor the development of antibiotic-resistant
disease strains. They also are the leaders in the efforts to develop,
refine, and apply effective control strategies for re-emerging diseases like
tuberculosis and malaria. Governments are being given the information they
need to promote healthy lifestyles for their people in the areas of
nutrition, maternal and child health, food safety, environmental health, and
to reduce sickness and death from drug abuse and smoking-related causes. In
each of these areas, and hundreds more, these agencies are involved in
putting technical expertise from bilateral and private sources directly into
contact with those who need assistance. Specialized technical assistance in
health is provided to national or global team efforts, in which national
health authorities and health professionals, community groups and private
industry, and other bilateral and United Nations agencies are carrying out
the implementation.
These mechanisms of technical cooperation and assistance in health have made
it possible to achieve notable successes. Without PAHO and WHO leadership
of the international effort on disease eradication, we would not now have a
world without smallpox. Global eradication of polio is just around the
corner and under PAHO's leadership, polio has already been eliminated in the
whole of the Western Hemisphere. We can foresee a future in which guinea
worm disease is eradicated and leprosy, river blindness, Chagas disease and
lymphatic filariasis are eliminated as public health problems. New efforts
can build on the previous successes and on strengthened health systems,
paving the way for elimination of measles in the Americas and, eventually,
global measles eradication, for example.
Importance of PAHO and WHO
These examples of some of the many activities of PAHO and WHO begin to
answer the question: "Why are PAHO and WHO important to the U.S.?" As I
have told this Committee before, there are three basic reasons why the
organizations represented here today emphatically support full U.S.
membership and full and timely U.S. dues payments to PAHO and WHO:
1. Membership in PAHO and WHO saves the U.S. Government money.
2. PAHO and WHO produce cost-effective results in health for the United
States.
3. Active U.S. participation in PAHO and WHO is necessary to maintain
important U.S. interests and values that cannot be addressed as cheaply, as
well, or sometimes at all, by the U.S. acting unilaterally or bilaterally.

Membership in PAHO and WHO saves the U.S. Government money and gets results.
The most obvious example is that each and every year since smallpox was
eradicated in 1978, the U.S. has saved substantially more money as a result
of that one achievement than it spends to belong to PAHO and WHO.
Eradication means no more smallpox vaccinations, no more airport
surveillance for smallpox, no more medical costs for treatment of smallpox
or vaccination reactions. All of these factors would cost the U.S. alone
about $300 million a year today..
Another eradication savings windfall is just around the corner. Polio was
eradicated from the Americas in 1991; when we succeed in eradicating it from
the world, CDC estimates that the U.S. will save at least $230 million every
year thereafter. The WHO-led global polio eradication campaign, which
involves many public and private partners including CDC, AID, UNICEF, and
Rotary International, needs to be sustained to the finish line about five
years from now to make those cost savings a reality. So far there has been
a more than 90 percent decline in reported polio cases worldwide between
1985 and 1997 and the number of countries reporting no polio increased from
85 countries in 1985 to 154 countries in 1996. Even though wild poliovirus
is already eliminated from the Americas, the U.S. and other countries must
keep immunizing our children as long as wild polio exists anywhere in the
world.
Funding for WHO and PAHO is based on the burden- sharing principle; other
countries contribute to the costs as well as making their experts and
knowledge available to this worldwide health effort that benefits all of us.
Prevention and early control measures keep U.S. budget costs for escalating
in other areas, particularly health care expenses. In the United States,
annual domestic health expenditures are $1 trillion. The annual U.S.
payment to WHO for all its regular activities is a little over $100 million,
and to PAHO about $42 million, an amount that is only one ten-thousandth of
the annual U.S. health expenditure. International prevention is clearly the
cheapest approach, especially when the burden can be shared among all
countries.
As mentioned earlier, WHO and PAHO are set up to mobilize both their own
knowledgeable staff and worldwide high- quality scientific and operational
expertise to assist with specific needs. These cost-effective networks of
partners are linked up on short notice for emergencies like epidemics or on
an ongoing basis for advice, research, surveillance, or reporting, often at
little or no cost. International partners can be teamed up directly with
the key governmental health decision-makers at the country and regional
level to solve problems. These agencies have universal access to problem
sites worldwide based on their neutrality and the legal accountability
embodied in prior membership agreements. They are able to be active in
communicable disease control in crises and in countries where U.S. interests
may be at stake but the U.S. may not want to be directly involved. WHO
surveillance and response activities are being expanded and will also cover,
at their request, the diseases that the Biological Warfare Convention
monitoring group is following. Their universality and scientific capacity
of these agencies also make them the best forum for establishing
international norms and standards and for collecting and disseminating
authoritative information on health.

The U.S. has important interests and values at stake in PAHO and WHO.
International technical cooperation in health matters is often discussed as
if it were foreign aid. It is not. It is essential to protect United
States' interests. In September 1995 a high-level, 17-agency U.S.
Government working group chaired by Dr David Satcher, then of CDC, released
a report entitled Infectious Disease -- A Global Health Threat. This report
became the basis of a 1996 Presidential Decision Directive (PDD) that
established a new national policy calling for a coordinated U.S. government
response to address the growing health and security threats posed by
infectious diseases. The Emerging Infectious Disease Task Force carrying out
the PDD has focused on collaboration and coordination both within the U.S.
and with international partners to improve worldwide disease surveillance,
reporting, and response. WHO and PAHO have been identified from the
beginning as essential partners for the U.S. effort to combat the infectious
disease threat. As Dr Satcher, co-chair of the Emerging Infectious Disease
Task Force, says, "domestic and international health are intimately
linked,...microbes do not respect borders, and... the United States cannot
protect the health of its citizens without playing a leadership role in
international health.'
U.S. Interests
The interests and values at stake for the U.S. in choosing to belong to and
exercise leadership in WHO and PAHO include: health interests such as
control of communicable diseases that will spread to the U.S.; national
security interests such as access to and monitoring of data on worldwide
disease strains and chemical and radiation threats, monitoring of compliance
with the Biological Warfare Convention, and health issues involved in troop
deployments overseas; economic interests including those related to travel
and trade in pharmaceuticals, biologicals, and food as well as the
improvements in health, food security, and legal rights around the globe on
which future economic productivity and U.S. export markets depend; political
interests such as the strengthening of civil society organizations and good
governance in health systems; and the humanitarian values which underpin
traditionally generous U.S. support for the elimination of preventable
suffering and death in the world, especially among children.

Reform
Regarding reform, these particular international organizations had already
been in an intensive reform mode for several years before that became the
buzzword for the UN system. WHO and PAHO assessed budgets and staffs have
been stable or declining in recent years in response to calls for increased
stringency even as the health challenges have mounted, with every effort
being made to sustain program and country-level activities. Continuing
intensive reforms and restructuring to meet evolving global and health needs
will continue after July 1998 when the new Director-General of WHO takes
office. The sole nominee for Director-General, whose candidacy is supported
by the U.S. and who is expected to be elected at the World Health Assembly
in May 1998, is Dr. Gro Harlem Brundtland, the former Prime Minister of
Norway.

Conclusion
Mr. Chairman, over the years, steady support by this Committee and by the
U.S. Government for the fabric of international health cooperation has
produced clear domestic cost savings that are attributable to the
eradication of smallpox as well as the incalculable benefits of better
health for people all over the world.
The American Public Health Association and the other organizations who join
in this statement express their appreciation for this Committee's actions
last year to insure full funding in FY1998 of the 1997 contributions to WHO
and PAHO. It has never been more important to maintain cost-effective,
prevention-oriented, collaborative international health efforts than in
times of budget stringency like the present. Prompt and full payment of
contributions and arrears by all member states, including the U.S., will
remain essential for sound management and implementation of WHO and PAHO
programs. Each American benefits from PAHO and WHO. These organizations
continue to need strong leadership and reliable financial support from the
United States to accomplish their tasks. We therefore strongly urge the
Committee to keep the health of America in mind and to provide full funding
for WHO and PAHO in the subcommittee's action for Fiscal Year 1999
appropriations.
We also encourage the Committee to make provision for prompt repayment of
prior year arrears to PAHO and WHO in light of ongoing reform activities.
Thank you and I will be glad to respond to any questions.
