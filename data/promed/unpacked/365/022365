On 16 Aug 2007, the Danish regional food authority (Fodevareregion
Ost) and the Statens Serum Institut (SSI) became aware of an outbreak
of _Shigella sonnei_ infections. The 1st cases to be reported were
employees of 2 companies. They had eaten a variety of vegetables,
including raw baby corn and sugar snaps in their workplace canteens.
Preliminary interviews with further cases indicated that the probable
source was imported baby corn or sugar snaps that had been
distributed at the beginning of August 2007. The suspected foods were
distributed by a wholesaler to green grocers, catering firms,
restaurants, and shops throughout the country. Due to the strong
suspicion about these food vehicles, the Veterinary and Food
Administration issued a recall of baby corn and sugar snaps on 17 Aug
2007. Furthermore, the SSI undertook investigations to determine the
extent of the outbreak and its source.
A cohort study was undertaken in one of the many workplaces to have
been affected by the outbreak to test the primary hypothesis that
infection was associated with eating baby corn in the work canteen.
Of 103 web-based questionnaire responses returned by 21 Aug 2007 from
people who had eaten in the canteen, 24 reported gastrointestinal
symptoms consistent with shigellosis. In the questionnaire, one set
of questions focused on which days the employees had eaten in the
canteen and the others on which food items had been eaten in the
canteen on 6 and 7 Aug 2007, the 2 days when the suspected baby corn
was known to have been served. There was a higher, although
non-significant, relative risk of illness among people who had eaten
in the canteen on 6, 7, or 8 Aug 2007. The relative risk for
gastrointestinal symptoms among people who had eaten baby corn was
4.6 (95 percent confidence interval (CI): 2.0-10.9) on 6 Aug 2007 and
4.0 (95 percent CI: 1.7-9.6) on 7 Aug 2007. The attack rate in those
employees who ate baby corn on 6 or 7 Aug 2007 was 64 percent.
Concurrent with the cohort study, notified cases from different parts
of Denmark were interviewed and asked about food intake prior to
onset of symptoms. The results of these interviews were consistent
with baby corn being the source of infection. Moreover, a large
number of workplaces were found to be affected by the outbreak and
their canteens had served baby corn from the suspected imported
batches in their salad bars. Taken together, the available
epidemiological and food trace-back evidence strongly supported the
finding that baby corn imported from Thailand was the source of the outbreak.
Between 6 and 24 Aug 2007, the SSI received notifications of 122 _S.
sonnei_ isolates. This is almost triple the number of isolates
confirmed for the whole of 2006 (46 isolates). A case in this
outbreak was defined as any case of _S. sonnei_ infection acquired in
Denmark after 1 Aug 2007 excluding those who had travelled to an
endemic area in the 3 days before onset of symptoms or those that
could be explained by an alternative exposure.
To date, 120 cases have met the agreed case definition (2 of the 122
notified ones were excluded as travel-related). Cases were reported
through the laboratory surveillance system from the whole of Denmark,
but most cases (97/120, 81 percent) were reported from Zealand
[Sjaelland, the largest island of Denmark (excluding Greenland, which
is a Danish territory). - CopyEd.MJ]. The median age was 38 years
(range 1-92 years) and 90 cases (75 percent) were female. Information
on symptom onset dates, which ranged from 6 Aug 2007 until 17 Aug
2007, was available for 55 cases (Figure [for figure, see source URL
- Mod.LL]). A quarter of these cases (13/55) were known to have been
admitted to hospital. To date, in-depth interviews have been
performed for 35 cases. Of these, all reported diarrhea, with half
(17/35) experiencing bloody diarrhoea and 91 percent (32/35)
reporting stomach cramps.
Antibiotic resistance typing on 11 samples taken from cases has
revealed that isolates were resistant to tetracycline, ampicillin,
sulfonamides, cephalothin, and streptomycin, but susceptible to
nalidixic acid, ciprofloxacin, chloramphenicol, mecillinam
[amdinocillin - Mod.LL], and gentamicin. Typing of isolates by pulse
field gel electrophoresis is ongoing. Microbiological examination of
the suspected batches of imported baby corn has detected high levels
of _E. coli_, indicating fecal contamination. Additionally
_Salmonella_ (serotypes as yet undetermined) have been found in 2
batches. _Shigella_ have so far not been detected, but analyses are
still ongoing.
An Early Warning Response System report was issued on 18 Aug 2007.
The available information suggests that the outbreak is confined to
Denmark but we encourage other countries to be aware of potential
clusters of _S. sonnei_ cases. A small number of cases have been
reported from Sweden but those contacted so far all appear to have
been infected in Denmark. However, it is known that a small part of a
batch of baby corn imported into Denmark was sold on to Sweden. This
is currently undergoing microbiological examination to determine
whether it was contaminated. Furthermore, among the cases in the
outbreak there were individuals who acquired the infection on the
ferry between Oslo and Copenhagen and it was found that baby corn
from an incriminated batch was served on this ferry.
Due to the long shelf life of baby corn (3 weeks), the interventions
made to trace the source of infection and to recall the product are
likely to have prevented additional cases of illness. Although
shigellosis does occur in Denmark and small outbreaks are
occasionally seen, most cases are travel-related. The last large _S.
sonnei_ outbreak in Denmark was in 1998, also associated with eating
raw baby corn imported from Thailand (1).

[This is another example of how the global market place contributes
to foodborne illness thousands of miles away from harvest. It is not
clear where in the process (from harvest to market place) the
contamination occurred.
Many varieties of corn (<http://ask.yahoo.com/20030203.html>) can be
used to produce baby corn. Seed companies offer special types of seed
to grow baby corn, but all of these grow plants and corn ears that
are just as big as the usual corn. The secret is in the harvesting.
Baby corn ears are picked by hand immediately when the silks emerge
from the ear tips or a few days after. Corn matures quickly, so the
harvest must be timed carefully to avoid ending up with normal corn
ears. Baby corn ears are generally 4.5 cm to 10 cm (approx. 2-4 in)
in length and 7 mm to 17 mm (0.3-0.7 in) in diameter.
Most baby corn commercially available is grown and processed in Asia,
particularly in Thailand. Because baby corn must be picked by hand,
it is too labor-intensive for most western farms. It has been an
extremely important crop in Thailand since 1976, and other Asian
nations have also begun producing and exporting it. Perhaps this is
why baby corn is so often found in Asian recipes. - Mod.LL
