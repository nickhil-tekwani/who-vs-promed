State health officials have asked doctors to take a closer look at anyone who developed pneumonia-like symptoms after visiting a South Whitehall Township [Lehigh County] outpatient facility after 6 cases of legionnaires' disease were linked to the site.

Integrated Health Campus, at 240 and 250 Cetronia Road, houses a number of offices. In an advisory issued to health care facilities, the Pennsylvania Department of Health asked clinicians to be vigilant for signs of the disease, also called legionellosis, among patients who visited the campus in the 14 days before their illness.

According to a statement from Integrated Health Campus, the investigation has focused on the 250 [Cetronia Road] building, specifically the decorative fountain in its lobby. The company hired Legionella Risk Management Inc. of Chalfont, Bucks County, to conduct an investigation and remediation of the campus water systems after being notified of the risk by the health department on 23 Oct 2013.

Kenneth Szydlow, vice president of marketing and public relations for St Luke's University Health Network, said the 240 building -- which contains a number of St Luke's offices, including cancer treatment -- is no longer implicated in the alert.

Dr Jeffrey Jahre said the health department had cleared the campus to continue business as usual. It would not have done so if it had believed staff and visitors were at risk. In an email, health department press secretary Aimee Tysarczyk said the department was limited in the information it could share because of restrictions under the Disease Prevention and Control Law regarding continuing investigations.

Regarding the status of the 240 building, Tysarczyk wrote: "The entire campus is currently open; however, we're early in the investigation stages and therefore would not make immediate exclusions." She encouraged people with concerns to consult a doctor. "It's important for the public to know that _Legionella_ is commonly found in various places in the environment and cases occur all the time throughout the state," Tysarczyk wrote.

"Legionnaires' is a reportable disease in Pennsylvania, which means health care facilities, health care practitioners, and clinical laboratories are required to report it to the Department of Health within 24 hours and thereafter we will investigate those reports, which involves asking a series of questions, including where the individual has recently been."

Finding a location common to patients does not necessarily mean the location is the source of the disease, so the department has to expand its inquiry beyond that common denominator.

Tysarczyk said IHC [Integrated Health Campus] had been cooperative and followed appropriate measures to assist with the investigation, and that the health department had followed traditional protocols by issuing an advisory -- one step below an alert, which indicates a more serious situation -- to health care professionals.

The advisory urges vigilance about reporting potential cases so the department can follow up and investigate, Tysarczyk wrote.

Integrated Health Campus's statement said the fountain in the lobby of the 250 building and a fountain outside the lobby were shut down and drained. The results of tests on the water are pending. The facility's drinking water system was also sanitized, though it was not considered a likely source of the infection. The health department conducted its own inspection, taking water samples Friday.

"According to the Department of Health, in light of the rapid and extensive remediation, it is acceptable to continue business as usual at Integrated Health Campus," the IHC statement said.

People get [legionnaires'] disease when they breathe in mist or vapor containing [_Legionella_] bacteria. Most people exposed to the bacteria don't get sick, and those who do typically recover with antibiotic treatment. The disease is not spread from person to person. Symptoms include cough, shortness of breath, and high fever, which typically begin 2 to 14 days after exposure. Older adults, smokers, and people with weakened immune systems are particularly susceptible. The disease is confirmed by a urine antigen test. Individuals without symptoms do not need to be tested. Most people with legionnaires' [disease] will have pneumonia, because the bacteria grow and thrive in the lungs [sic]. [All patients with legionnaires' disease will have pneumonia due to _Legionella_ bacteria, because by definition legionnaires' disease is the acute pneumonic form of legionellosis.] Pneumonia is confirmed either by chest X-ray or physical exam.
