In the 1st 7 weeks of the year [2013], the number of individuals with conjunctivitis in Nicaragua increased by 9 percent compared to the same period in 2012, according to government officials on Thursday [21 Feb 2013]. On Wed 20 Feb 2013, the Health Minister, Sonia Castro, and the coordinator of the Communication and Citizenship Council, Rosario Murillo, in separate speeches on Channel 4 television stressed the need for improved personal hygiene. To date, the territories with more reported cases are Matagalpa, Jinotega, Leon, Managua, and Chinandega, according to the Ministry of Health.

Of particular concern is the prevalence of viral [conjunctival] disease in towns like Jinotega, Managua, Matagalpa, Siuna, Very Very, San Dionisio, Somoto, Achuapa, San Isidro, Matiguas, Jinotepe, Chinandega and Leon. Children under 4 years of age and younger are the most affected, said Murillo. "We must take this warning very seriously to prevent a larger outbreak," said a member of the Presidential Cabinet.

2/3rds of the infections are viral in origin and 24 percent from other causes, with 10 percent of patients developing haemorrhagic conjunctivitis, according to an official of the Communication and Citizenship Council. Medical centres can provide practical advice to reduce the spread of the [infection], such as washing hands and changing pillowcases frequently and avoidance of sharing eye cosmetics, towels, and handkerchiefs with others.

[The most common causes of conjunctivitis are viruses, bacteria, and allergens. But there are other causes, including chemicals, fungi, certain diseases, and contact lens use (especially the extended-wear type). The conjunctiva can also become irritated by foreign bodies in the eye and by indoor and outdoor air pollution caused, for example, by chemical vapors, fumes, smoke, or dust.

Viral conjunctivitis can be caused by a number of different viruses, many of which are associated with an upper respiratory tract infection, cold, or sore throat. It usually begins in one eye and may progress to the 2nd eye within days. Viral conjunctivitis spreads easily and rapidly between people and can result in epidemics. Viral conjunctivitis is typically mild, with symptoms being the worst on days 3-5 of infection. The condition usually clears up in 7-14 days without treatment and resolves without any long-term effects. In some cases, it can take 2-3 weeks or more for viral conjunctivitis to completely clear up, depending on whether complications develop.

This news report gives no indication of the causation of the outbreak in Nicaragua, but elsewhere in Central America, viral conjunctivitis has been associated with climatic conditions such as prolonged sand and dust storms causing irritation and transmission of infection.
