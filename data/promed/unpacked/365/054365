TUBERCULOSIS, WILD BOARS - SPAIN (02)

[From the previous ProMED-mail posting referenced below:"The Environmental
Council will advance the wild boar hunting season in Els Ports national
hunting reserve to September [2005], allowing intensification of their
capture rate. This, in order to reduce the wild boar population and stop
dissemination of tuberculosis, which was initially detected at the end of
2004...Wildlife management aimed at reducing the density of susceptible
animals within an infected area may contribute to the control of infectious
diseases in animals and -- if zoonotic -- their spillover to humans.]
The major predator of wild boars, in places where you don't have wolves and
mountain lions, happens to be male wild boars, who frequently unearth,
kill, and eat the litters of territorial rivals. (This is why boars and
young are always separated at pig farms.)
In addition, the size of surviving boar litters is closely governed by the
accessibility of food to the females.
The more boars you shoot, accordingly, the more boars you end up with. The
males are much more likely to be shot, being more often diurnal in habits
and much less likely to spend their days underground.
The females will benefit by food abundance, will raise larger litters, the
litters will be subject to markedly less predation, and within a year there
will be more boars in the habitat than ever, spreading more TB than ever
(unless you have a major food crop failure, e.g., an acute shortage of acorns.)

[Swine behavior is certainly territorial and subscribes to survival of the
meanest and fittest. It is not my intention to imply this is the way all
breeds of swine behave; this is only an observation of behavior of wild
boars and may provide food for thought for those in the council as to how
they want to implement their plan with regard to swine tuberculosis.
There may need to be more information on the documentation on what the
author has sent, as based upon these comments alone, it would be possible
to ban hunting altogether. I am not sure that is the proper approach either.
A lot of work on management of feral pigs (which seem to have similar
ecology) has been carried out in Australia. They have also prepared a
detailed emergency plan in case FMD is introduced into their large pig
population. They compared various pig control methods, such as hunting with
dogs, trapping, and poisoned baits (mainly warfarin). A typical conclusion
was: "Hunting was generally not as effective in reducing pig numbers as
poisoning with warfarin, but could be useful for obtaining samples of pigs
for monitoring disease during the first few days of an exotic disease
outbreak, and also for killing pigs that have survived other control
methods". (JC Mcilroy and RJ Saillard, 1989: The Effect of Hunting With
Dogs on the Numbers and Movements of Feral Pigs, Sus-Scrofa, and the
Subsequent Success of Poisoning Exercises in Namadgi-National-Park.
