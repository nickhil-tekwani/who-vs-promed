Pork meat contaminated with Bacillus anthracis in Krasnodar region
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------
The Seversky district in the Krasnodar region has been quarantined after
_Bacillus anthracis_ was found in the meat of slaughtered pigs. The infected
pig(s) was/were found in the settlement of Severskaya, Itar-Tass was told on
Tuesday by the Krasnodar regional Sanitary Surveillance Inspectorate.
The local veterinary personnel have taken the necessary measures to prevent
the spread of the pathogen: cattle slaughtering has been stopped and meat
sold at local markets has been taken under strict control.
General vaccination of cattle has been conducted everywhere.
***
Have there been any reports of anthrax recently from the region (Krasnodar
borders on Abkhaziya, the Crimean Republic [Black Sea], Adygea and
Karachay-Cherkess Republics, Stavropol and Rostov-on-Don)?

[Marjorie is an epidemiologist who is kindly websurfing for us. There is
clearly more to this report than meets the eye. Last summer's anthrax
reports showed that this disease was widespread in the region and probably
grossly under-reported. The outbreak we reported in July-August 1998 had 32
human cases and a death. One report (03) referred to infected breeding pigs
from Kalmykia ... "Infectious pedigree pigs were brought from Kalmykia for
the purposes of breeding [... sic]." And the cattle vaccination had been
inadequate that summer (03). However, winter outbreaks of livestock anthrax
usually indicate contaminated feed of some sort. It is interesting that the
slaughtering of a more susceptible species, cattle, has been temporarily
stopped. As pigs are moderately resistant to anthrax, one is tempted to ask
whether these affected pigs had had access to cattle, in whole or in part,
that had recently died of anthrax - MHJ]
