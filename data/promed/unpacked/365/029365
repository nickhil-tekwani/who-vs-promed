New diagnoses of HTLV infection in England and Wales: 2002-2004
----------------------------------------------
Introduction
------------
Human T cell lymphotropic viruses (HTLV) are retroviruses transmitted
through breast feeding, sexual contact, blood transfusion and
injecting drug use. HTLV is endemic in the Caribbean, and parts of
Africa, Japan and South America, with isolated foci in other areas.
Infection is life long. Fewer than 5 percent of those infected
progress to one of the HTLV-related diseases, but these are
debilitating and often fatal. In England and Wales, laboratory and
clinical reports of new HTLV diagnoses are routinely collected,
including infections identified by the blood service since the
introduction of anti-HTLV testing in August 2002.
Between 2002 and 2004, 273 individuals were diagnosed with HTLV: 102
(37 percent) were male and 169 female (sex was not reported for 2).
Median ages at diagnosis were 54 and 50 years respectively. Clinical
reports were received for 78 percent (212/273) of the individuals.
Where reported, 58 percent (116/199) of individuals were of black
Caribbean ethnicity and 29 percent (57/199) white; 87 percent
(128/147) were probably infected heterosexually or through
mother-to-child transmission; 45 percent (66/146) were probably
infected in the Caribbean and 40 percent (59/146) in the United Kingdom.
An appreciable number of HTLV infections continue to be diagnosed
within England and Wales, with increases in 2002-2003 because of
anti-HTLV testing of blood donations. While most infections diagnosed
are directly associated with the Caribbean, transmission of HTLV
infection is occurring within England and Wales. Specialist care
services for HTLV-infected individuals and their families have
improved in recent years, but prevention remains limited.
Background
----------
The Health Protection Agency undertakes surveillance of new diagnoses
of human T cell lymphotropic viruses (HTLV) in England and Wales
(E&W). HTLV types I and II [4 types of HTLV are now recognized, and I
and II are now designated 1 and 2: see ProMED-mail post; Primate
T-lymphotropic viruses 3 & 4, human - Cameroon 20050226.0610. -
Mod.CP] can be transmitted through breast feeding, sexual contact,
and blood transfusion, with HTLV-II particularly associated with
injecting drug use. HTLV-I is endemic in the Caribbean, Japan, South
America, and parts of Africa, with HTLV-II found among some native
American groups. If infected, the lifetime risk of developing disease
is low (less than 5 percent). Clinically, HTLV-I infection may cause
adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) and/or HTLV-I-associated
myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) [1]. It is also
associated with other inflammatory conditions [1]. There is some
evidence that HTLV-II infection is associated with neurological and
lympho-proliferative disorders [2].
Methods
--------
Surveillance of new laboratory diagnoses of HTLV infection in E&W
began in the late 1980s [3]. In 2002, surveillance was enhanced by
the collection of further epidemiological information through a
clinical reporting scheme, described in full elsewhere [4]. This
coincided with the introduction of the national, routine testing of
all blood donations for anti-HTLV by the UK Blood Services in August
2002 [4]. Reports of any HTLV infections diagnosed by the blood
service in E&W are included in the routine surveillance scheme.
Probable route and country of infection are collected on clinical
HTLV reports. The clinician indicates through which route the patient
is most likely to have been infected, and in which country. Where it
is not clear, more than one route or country can be indicated. For
those infected through heterosexual intercourse, information on their
sexual partner is sought (e.g. had the partner injected drugs or has
the partner had heterosexual intercourse in the Caribbean).
Surveillance findings from 2002 have previously been published [4].
Here, we present data from the surveillance system for 2002, 2003 and
2004; based on reports made to the scheme by the end of May 2005. The
surveillance system coverage is likely to be near complete for
laboratory-confirmed HTLV diagnoses made in E&W, as most confirmatory
testing for HTLV is undertaken at either at the Health Protection
Agency Centre for Infections or the Health Protection Agency
laboratory at King's College hospital, from which routine laboratory
reports are sent. In 2004, the laboratory at the Centre for
Infections performed approximately 1500 HTLV tests. Clinical reports
are sent out for completion for every HTLV positive laboratory report received.
Results
-------
Between 2002 and 2004, 273 reports of new HTLV diagnoses were made in
E&W; 88 in 2002, 101 in 2003 and 84 in 2004. 251 (93 percent) were
HTLV-I infections, 13 HTLV-II, one an HTLV-I&II co-infection, and,
for 8, the HTLV type was as yet undetermined. Of the 273 people
diagnosed with HTLV between 2002 and 2004, 102 (37 percent) were men
(4 HTLV-II), 169 (62 percent) women (9 HTLV-II), and gender was not
reported for the remaining 2 (one HTLV-II). The proportion of
diagnoses among women increased over time: in 2002, 57 percent of
HTLV diagnoses were among women, by 2004, 69 percent [see original
text for tabulation of data]. Median age at diagnosis was 54 years
for men and 50 years for women.
The majority (67 percent) of reports were about individuals diagnosed
or receiving care in London. Elsewhere in E&W, the largest numbers of
reports were about HTLV-infected individuals diagnosed/cared for in
the West Midlands region of England. At the time of writing, a
clinical report (collecting more detailed epidemiological
information) had been made for 212 (78 percent) individuals. The
proportion of clinical reports made for individuals by year of
diagnosis is as follows: in 2004 (75 percent [63/84]), in 2003 (83
percent [84/101]) and in 2002 (74 percent [65/88]). Further clinical
reports for diagnoses made in 2004 are expected during 2005.
Where ethnicity was reported (199), 116 (58 percent) individuals were
black Caribbeans, 57 (29 percent) white (10 HTLV-II), 15 black
African (one HTLV-II) and 11 of other ethnicity. The rate of HTLV
diagnosis was therefore 20.5 per 100 among black Caribbeans living in
E&W between 2002 and 2004, compared to 3.1 per 100 among black
Africans and 0.1 per 100 among the white population [5]. The probable
route of infection was reported for 147 individuals: 39 (27 percent)
were probably infected through heterosexual intercourse (4 HTLV-II),
40 (27 percent) through mother to infant transmission, 49 (33
percent) through either route, 14 through blood transfusion (2
HTLV-II) and 5 through other routes (2 HTLV-II) Where the probable
country of infection was reported (146), 66 (45 percent) individuals
were probably infected in the Caribbean (35 in Jamaica), 59 (40
percent) in the UK (4 HTLV-II), 12 in Africa (7 in West Africa) (one
HTLV-II), 4 in the Middle East, 2 in Asia and 3 elsewhere (one HTLV-II).
There were 42 individuals infected through either heterosexual
intercourse or mother to child transmission within the UK, of whom 4
were known to have had a high risk sexual partner (e.g. injecting
drug user); 19 a partner or parent infected in the Caribbean, 2 a
partner or parent infected in the UK and one, a partner or parent
infected in Africa.
Where reason for testing was reported (208), 81 (39 percent)
individuals had been tested because of symptoms (one HTLV-II), 82 (39
percent) as blood donors (8 HTLV-II), 13 (6 percent) had an
HTLV-infected positive sexual partner, 13 (6 percent) had an
HTLV-infected blood relative and 19 (9 percent) for other reasons (2
HTLV-II). The reason stated changed over time. There were larger
numbers of individuals diagnosed through the screening of blood
donors during 2002 (n=32) and 2003 (n=35) than in 2004 (n=15).
Clinical presentation at diagnosis was reported for 192 individuals,
of whom 93 (48 percent) were asymptomatic (7 HTLV-II), 45 (23
percent) had ATLL, 14 (7 percent) had HAM/TSP and 40 (21 percent) had
other symptoms (3 HTLV-II). Where ATLL type was reported (n=36), 19
(53 percent) had a lymphoma, 11 (31 percent) acute ATLL, 4 chronic
ATLL and 2 smoldering ATLL. Of all the individuals diagnosed between
2002 and 2004 in E&W, 14 are known to have died (one HTLV-II).
Discussion
----------
An appreciable number of HTLV infections continue to be diagnosed
within E&W each year. The introduction of anti-HTLV testing of blood
donations increased the number of new HTLV diagnoses in 2002 and
2003. However, by 2004, low numbers of infected blood donors were
identified; most donors had already been tested, with those found
positive excluded from further donation and referred to specialist
centers for appropriate care. Overall, the rate of HTLV infection in
blood donations in E&W between August 2002 and December 2004 for new
donors was 5.1 per 100 donations and for repeat donors, 0.9 per 100
donations [6].
The majority of HTLV diagnoses were among those of black Caribbean
ethnicity, with HTLV diagnoses rates highlighting that, in E&W, the
black Caribbean population is disproportionately affected by HTLV
infection. Infections were thought to have been mainly acquired
through heterosexual intercourse and/or mother to child transmission,
both within the Caribbean and the UK. In the main, those infected in
the UK had a partner or parent from an endemic area. Data illustrate,
therefore, that while HTLV infection in E&W is mainly found among
those originating from endemic areas, there is also transmission of
the infection in E&W itself. The geographical distribution of
diagnosed HTLV infection in E&W reflects both the distribution of the
black Caribbean population, which is focused in London (60 percent)
and the West Midlands (14 percent) [7], and also the location of
specialist HTLV centers in London and Birmingham.
A clinical report containing more detailed epidemiological and
clinical information had not yet been received for 21 (25 percent)
individuals diagnosed in 2004. More outstanding clinical reports are
expected over the coming months. It is important to bear this in mind
when interpreting trends. For a relatively large proportion of
individuals for whom a clinical report was made, the probable route
and country of was not known (about 30 percent), highlighting
difficulties in assigning these variables for infections acquired
many years previously, particularly in clinical settings where sexual
histories are not collected routinely (as they would be for example,
in GU medicine). In addition, probable route of infection was not
known for those with only a laboratory report. Such data
incompleteness may bias conclusions from routine surveillance data.
In this case, proportionally more of those diagnosed with symptoms or
with no reason for test did not have a probable route of infection
reported compared to those diagnosed as blood donors, a blood
relative or because of a positive partner, as well as older
individuals and those with no reported ethnicity. Finally, it is
important to remember that not all of those living with HTLV
infection in E&W will be diagnosed and there will be biases in
ascertaining HTLV infections within the population. For example, all
blood donations are tested for HTLV, and people with HTLV-associated
symptoms or HTLV-infected relatives or partners are more likely to be
tested than those with no symptoms or contacts.
In conclusion, while HTLV infections continue to be diagnosed in E&W,
the number of diagnoses in any given year seems to have peaked in
2003 with the identification of HTLV-infected blood donors, when
considering trends since 1987 [3]. While there are now 3 designated
sites across E&W (London, Birmingham and Manchester) providing
specialist investigation, therapy and contact screening services for
those infected and their families, the prevention of HTLV
transmission, for example through screening of pregnant women for
HTLV infection and contact tracing, is limited.

[HTLV I, until recently prevalent mainly in the Caribbean region, has
moved with migrants to the UK and is spreading within migrant
communities in London, Birmingham and Manchester, and sporadically
elsewhere. Although the life-time associated risk of disease is low,
the diseases associated with HTLV infection -- adult T cell
leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) and/or HTLV-I-associated myelopathy/tropical
spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) -- are severe and often fatal. Although
effective surveillance of the blood supply in the UK is helping to
contain the spread of ATLL and HAM/TSP, these infections have spread
from the Caribbean region and exhibit some of the characteristics of
emerging diseases. - Mod.CP]
