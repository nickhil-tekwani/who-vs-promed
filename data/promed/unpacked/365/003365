RODENT DIE-OFF - BOLIVIA: REQUEST FOR INFORMATION

I have been trapping small mammals with a standard protocol in
semi-deciduous forest and pampa of NE Santa Cruz department of Bolivia for
5 years, and sporadically with non-standardized methods in several prior
years and in some other regions.
In November 2002 I recorded extremely high populations of murid rodents in
forest habitat, with very large numbers of emerging young. At high
densities were chiefly species of _Oecomys_ and _Oryzomys nitidus_ and _O.
megacephalus_.
My traplines do not evaluate _Oligoryzomys species_, which occupy more
riverside, commensal, and secondary edge habitats. I noted for the first
time in Bolivia several rodents (_Akodontines_ and _Oecomys bicolor_), dead
or dying in the road or in traps, of no apparent cause, and one died in the
hand for no evident reason (I do not collect such animals, as I am
concerned about disease and do not use protective clothing).
In 1989 I contracted bubonic plague in dry forest of NE La Paz, Bolivia
while collecting small rodents during a similar outbreak of _O. nitidus_
(many _Akodon_ sp. were also captured). In my 2 Nov 2002 sample, about 35
percent of the _O. megacephalus_ had tail scars likely attributable to
Leishmania.
As I left my study site 9 Nov 2002, mice (_O. bicolor_) were increasingly
invading the sleeping cabin (_Oligoryzomys_ c.f. _microtis_ are always
present in the kitchen/dining cabin). If these high populations are of
widespread occurrence, I suggest that 2002-3 could experience high
incidences of rodent-borne human disease (plague, leishmania, Andean virus,
Machupo virus). The several human cases of Hanta-group disease documented
in Santa Cruz Dept. this year may be associated with a rodent population peak.
My limited data suggest that other years of high rodent density in parts of
Bolivia included 1989 and 1998, while low densities occurred in 1991 and
1999, and moderate densities in 2000-01 (Emmons, unpublished data). I would
be interested in obtaining records of incidences of rodent-borne disease in
humans, especially leishmania, for Bolivia or adjacent countries for the
past 10-20 years, to examine for correlations with data on rodent numbers.

[At this point, there is not enough information on the clinical syndrome of
the affected rodents given to allow for speculation on the disease process
responsible for this die-off. While dying in the hand is suspicious of some
infectious or toxic process, it does not preclude starvation, although I
suspect this contributor is well versed in small mammals and would easily
have noticed if starvation was present.
Rodents can carry leishmaniasis, plague, and other diseases transmissible
to humans (such as hantavirus). Knowing the diseases in the rodent
population would be helpful in treating people exposed to these animals as
well.
If any of our Bolivian or South American readers have knowledgeable insight
on this report of an ongoing rodent die-off in the region, ProMED-mail
would appreciate your sharing such information with us. - Mod.TG]
