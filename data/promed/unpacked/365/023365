The following background information on Lyme disease in the Russian
Federation is abstracted from GIDEON <http://www.GideonOnline.com>:
The 1st cases of Lyme disease in the former Soviet Union were
diagnosed in 1985.
Disease incidence has been steadily increasing since 1991
<http://exhibit.gideononline.com/Lyme-Russia.jpg> , with reported
rates strikingly similar to those of the USA
<http://exhibit.gideononline.com/Lyme-Russia1.jpg>.
The disease is widespread, with a high incidence in the northwestern region.
-27 percent of cases during 1991 to 1994 were reported from the
Urals, and 17 percent from West Siberia.
-The estimated true incidence for 1994 was 9166 in the Russian
Federation, 622 in Ekakeinburg City and 622 in Sverdlovsk.
-Rates in the Republic of Karelia increased from 0.6 per 100 000 in
1991, to 11.3 per 100 000 in 2005.
-873 cases were reported in the Sverdlovsk region during 1991 to 1993.
-113 368 tick bites and 219 cases of Lyme disease (2.6 per 100 000)
were reported in the Arkhangelsk region during 1992 to 2001.
-5661 cases were reported in St. Petersburg during 1985 to 2003.
_Borrelia burgdorferi_, _B. garinii_ and _B. afzelii_ are all
identified as agents of Lyme disease in this country.
-The principal vectors are _Ixodes ricinus_ in the east and _I.
persulcatus_ in the west.
-Borrelia (primarily _B. garinii_) are found in _I. persulcatus_
ticks in 3 areas of far-eastern Russia: Khabarovsk, Vladivostok and
Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk.
-_B. garinii_ and _B. afzelii_ are common in _I. persculcatus_ ticks
from St. Petersburg and Kaliningrad.
- 11 percent of _Ixodes ricinus_ and 26.3 percent of _I. persulcatus_
in the vicinity of St. Petersburg (Marskaja and Lisy Nos, 1997 to
1998) were infected.
-_Borrelia garinii_ is found principally in _I. ricinus_, while _B.
afzelii_ is evenly distributed among the 2 tick species.
-_Borrelia burgdorferi_ was first identified in this country in 2000
-- isolates from _Ixodes ricinus_ in the Khostinsk region (Krasnodar
Territory).
- 37.6 percent of _Ixodes persulcatus_ and 3.6 percent of
_Dermacentor reticulates_ from Western Siberia are infected with
_Borrelia burgdorferi_ (2001).

[With regard to the comment on tick control in the previous post
20061026.3059, insecticidal spraying with sulfur or sulfur compounds
is an outdated method. Acaricides ( i.e. insecticides used to
control ticks) usually involve organophosphates, carbamates or
pyrethroid insecticides, and are mainly used against ticks of cattle
and other livestock, i.e. veterinary dosing with acaricides. It is
generally believed that spraying ticks involved in transmission of
Lyme disease is not appropriate; being too difficult to locate
places where ticks are. Good insect repellents are a better approach
tor personal protection. - Mod.MS]
