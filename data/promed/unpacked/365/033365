Gastroenteritis associated with consumption of fiddlehead ferns
---------------------------------------------------------------
Introduction
------------
On 13 May 2010, the Anchorage Department of Health and Human Services'
(DHHS) Food Safety and Sanitation Program received 2 calls from
persons reporting gastrointestinal illness following a buffet luncheon
held on 11 May 2010 at an Anchorage food facility. DHHS public health
nurses and environmental health specialists began an investigation.

Methods
-------
A retrospective cohort study was performed to determine risk factors
for illness. A case was defined as new onset of diarrhea or vomiting
in a person within 12 hours after eating at the Facility A buffet
luncheon on 11 May 2010. Lists of persons who ate from the buffet were
obtained. Questionnaires were sent by e-mail to patrons and provided
in hardcopy to employees. Responses were analyzed using Epi-Info
version 3.5.1. Stool specimens were collected from 4 ill persons for
enteric bacterial pathogen testing. Environmental health specialists
inspected Facility A's food storage and kitchen facilities, and
reviewed how foods and beverages were stored, prepared, cooked, and
served at the luncheon. Cleaning and sanitization procedures used at
Facility A were also reviewed. Information about the suppliers of the
foods and beverages served at the luncheon was obtained.

Results
-------
24 (100 percent) Facility A employees and 47 of 87 patrons (54
percent) responded to the questionnaire. Of those responding, 5 did
not eat buffet food. Of the 66 persons who ate buffet food and/or
beverages, 38 (58 percent) met the case definition. Their symptoms
included diarrhea (92 percent), nausea (71 percent), abdominal
cramping (47 percent), bloating/gas (37 percent), chills (24 percent),
headache (21 percent), vomiting (16 percent), fever (13 percent), and
blood in stool (3 percent). The median onset time after eating was 2
hours (range: 0.5-6 hours). The median duration of symptoms was 16
hours (range: 0.25-120 hours). Consumption of the fiddlehead fern
salad was strongly associated with illness of the 38 persons who ate
the fiddlehead fern salad, 37 (97 percent) met the case definition.
[The table included in the report is a list and associated risk ratios
associated with the buffet food and beverages served at Facility A -
Anchorage, Alaska, May 2010. The foods included: fiddlehead fern (the
tightly-coiled fronds of young ferns harvested in the spring for
consumption) salad, chicken with fruit salsa, water, mixed heated
vegetables, roasted potatoes, coffee, ice tea, dessert, beef
tenderloin, rolls, green salad, fruit salad.]
The data had a 95 percent confidence interval

Laboratory investigation
------------------------
All 4 stool samples were negative for common enteric bacterial
pathogens (such as, _Campylobacter_ spp., _Salmonella_, _Shiga_-toxin
producing _Escherichia coli_, and _Shigella_).

Environmental Investigation
---------------------------
No deficiencies were noted in the cleaning process, equipment, food
handling, or sanitary conditions of the kitchen. No food items from
the buffet were leftover for testing. The ferns were washed in a
sanitizing solution, steamed for approximately 5 minutes, spun in a
salad spinner, and chilled in vinegar. Almonds, oil, and herbs were
added later. Many ill persons reported that the ferns tasted "raw"
and/or "crunchy." The distributor who supplied the fiddlehead ferns
did not have any of the fern product remaining. The ferns had been
collected from the wild in British Columbia (BC), washed and packaged
in Vancouver, BC, transported to a distributor in California, and then
shipped to Anchorage. The BC packaging company includes a health
advisory label on its small retail packages of ferns. The bulk bags
sent to the distributor do not include this label.

Discussion
----------
This outbreak of acute gastroenteritis was associated with consumption
of fiddlehead ferns that were harvested in Canada and purchased by
Facility A through a retail distributor. The signs and symptoms of the
current outbreak were consistent with outbreaks of fiddlehead
fern-associated gastrointestinal illness that were recently reported
in New York and Canada (1,2). These investigations concluded that some
fern species contain an unidentified heat-labile toxin which is
responsible for causing gastrointestinal illness. No tests are
currently available to determine the presence of the toxin. Cooking
fiddlehead ferns (such as, boiling for 10-15 minutes) reduces the risk
of gastrointestinal illness (1,3). Symptoms of illness typically
appear within 30 minutes to 12 hours after eating raw or undercooked
fiddleheads. Illness generally lasts less than 24 hours, but can last
up to 3 days. When picking fiddleheads in the wild, it is important to
be familiar with the various species because some fiddleheads are
unsafe to eat. For example, bracken ferns are known to contain
carcinogenic compounds (4). The ostrich fern, which is found in Alaska
and Canada, is considered one of the safest fiddleheads to consume (4).

Recommendations
---------------
1. Suspected outbreaks of gastrointestinal or any other illness should
be reported to the Alaska Section of Epidemiology at (907) 269-8000,
or if in Anchorage to DHSS at (907) 343-4799.
2. Fiddlehead ferns should be cleaned thoroughly and boiled for 10-15
minutes or steamed for 10-12 minutes (until tender) prior to
consumption, and water used for cleaning or steaming fiddleheads
should be discarded (1,3).

[Fiddlehead ferns are beautiful and fascinating plants. Different
areas have different native foods. The fiddlehead ferns are a seasonal
delicacy in many parts of Alaska and the Pacific Northwest of the USA.
The toxic principle has not been identified, which also makes a
specific test difficult to develop to test for it. Following the
directions in this article and references when preparing fiddlehead
ferns is important to prevent gastroenteritis in consumers. - Mod.TG]
