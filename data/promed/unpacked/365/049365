Sick inmate sparks measles warning
----------------------------------
The North Coast Public Health Unit has issued a health alert after an
inmate transferred from the Grafton jail to the Kempsey jail was
found to have measles.

The Department of Corrective Services, Justice Health, the public
health unit and New South Wales Health are working to minimise
further spread of the illness. Staff and inmates who may have been
exposed have been advised about symptoms of measles and some have
been offered post-exposure treatment or vaccination.

Anyone who visited the jail on Fri 27 Aug 2010 (Fathers Day), or the
weekend of 11-12 Sep 2010, is advised they may have been exposed to measles.
