[Things are certainly quieting down. Only 6 new human cases in the
past week though the following report indicates that some cases may
not have reached the central database. I am informed by my colleagues
at ICDDRB (International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research,
Bangladesh) that the successful treatment for their human cutaneous
cases is 500 mg of ciprofloxacin twice a day for 10 days for adults
and the dose for children is 10 mg/kg/dose twice a day, also for 10
days. They have had no deaths. - Mod.MHJ]

The bout of anthrax has added 4 more victims at Kamarkhand Upazilla in
Sirajganj taking up the count to 218 in the district. The latest
victims are SB, 60, of Haluakandi village; LK, 16, and RK, 20, of
Dhopakandi village; and 'A', 18, of Shahbajpur village.

Statistics officer at Sirajganj civil surgeon's office Mohammad
Humayun Islam told bdnews24.com that Kamarkhand health and family
planning officer Mohammad Abdul Aziz identified the patients on
Wednesday [29 Sep 2010]. However, information published in the website
of the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research on
Wednesday [29 Sep 2010] said the number of victims in the district was
6 until Wednesday, which made the number of total victims in the
country to 605.

The government has recently launched a vaccination programme to combat
the disease, but admitted that it will not be possible to run the
programme across the country before Eid-ul-Azha, which falls in late
November [2010].

Livestock minister Abdul Latif Biswas on 21 Sep 2010 had said: "It
(vaccination across the country) will take much time and so the
government will first run vaccination programmes in the 18
sub-districts (Upazilla) under 8 districts, affected with anthrax." He
said it could take up to 15 days to complete vaccination in the
districts.

The minister said 2.5 million vaccines are there in the 18
sub-districts and 1.9 million of them have so far been sent to the
grassroots level and the rest will be sent swiftly.

A 25-member national steering committee, led by Latif, and a 5-member
technical committee, led by a joint secretary of livestock ministry,
was formed the same day to conduct anthrax control activities. 4 more
committees were also constituted at district- and Upazilla-levels.

Latif said the government also posted veterinary surgeons at the check
posts of 10 corridors on the border areas to check entry of any
anthrax infected cattle into the country.

The monitoring of cattle in markets and cattle meat will be
intensified, he added.

Fisheries and Livestock Minister Abdul Latif Biswas Tuesday [28 Sep
2010] expressed the hope that anthrax would be fully controlled well
ahead of the upcoming Eid-ul-Azha, reports UNB [United News of
Bangladesh]. "It's already under control. No anthrax was detected
since [18 Sep 2010] and we hope it will be fully controlled well ahead
of Eid-ul-Azha," he told reporters at his Secretariat office after a
meeting with Bangladesh Tanners Association.

He further said the government would compensate the owners whose
cattle had died of anthrax. "We'll first calculate the number of the
affected owners and then we'll compensate them after bringing anthrax
under full control."

Tanners Association leaders led by its chairman Shahin Ahmad met the
Livestock Minister and placed a set of demands. They said the industry
is counting a loss of around [Bangladesh Taka] 100 million [approx.
USD 1.44 million] due to anthrax. The Tanners Association leaders
informed the Minister that some 206 tanneries are in trouble and only
20 per cent of the targeted hide and skins have been collected so far.

Replying to a question, he said the government has sufficient stock of
vaccines and is monitoring the overall situation.

[It is a bit late to institute this policy in Bangladesh, but it is a
classic Canadian technique for increasing the reporting of anthrax
livestock deaths. They had none from about 1924 to say 1962 when they
instituted this policy. IMMEDIATELY they got calls which resulted in
lab confirmed cases. It had been there on the prairies for decades
unseen. The basic rate was CAD 500 per confirmed diagnosis to cover
carcass disposal. I think the government threw in free vaccine. The
only difference now is that the Canadian ranchers have got lazy and
don't vaccinate in the spring, counting on the government if anything
went wrong. So the new policy is that the Canadian government will
only pay out if there is paper evidence that the affected cattle had
been vaccinated during the spring working.

As there have been only a limited number of livestock cases in
Bangladeshi cattle and goats, whatever subsidy level the government
sets it will be cost-effective to get the farmers' involvement in
future years if the programme is formally instituted. It should
obviously be tied to pre-vaccination. - Mod.MHJ]

[4] Bovine: economic impact

Burmese [Myanmar] cattle exports to Bangladesh through illegal
cross-border trade have been hit by the anthrax panic in Bangladesh.

A Burmese cattle trader who wished to remain anonymous told Narinjara
that prices for Burmese cattle have slumped as the anthrax infections
among cows and humans in Bangladesh have increased. "The prices of
cattle are currently quite low in the border market due to the
outbreak of anthrax in Bangladesh. Previously, this time of year was
good for profits from Burmese cattle as Koraban (Eid al-Azha)
approaches, but this year [2010] due to the panic from the disease,
the cross-border cattle trade has suffered great losses," the trader
said. According to the Islamic calendar, Koraban, or Eid al-Azha, the
traditional festival that is celebrated by offering animals as a
sacrifice to Allah, will be held in mid-November [2010].

"The prices of cattle have unusually decreased from 25 000 Taka
[approx USD 360] per 100 kilograms [220 lb] to 20 000 Taka [approx.
USD 289] ahead of this festive occasion. We used to enjoy bumper
profits during this time of year in the past in Bangladesh, but this
year [2010] we suffer great losses," the trader added. A trader from
Shah Pori Island, which is the main border cattle market in
southeastern Bangladesh said, "We are also very unhappy with the
decreasing prices of Burmese cattle during this occasion as the demand
is very low here due to the disease fear." The Burmese trader said
they are suffering additional losses as the Burmese currency is rising
against the Bangladesh Taka in the border market.

Bangladesh media reports say that more than 600 people have been
diagnosed with anthrax. Government officials are concerned it will now
spread across the country from the 12 districts where outbreaks have
already been confirmed.

Cross-border traders say that it is not officially allowed to export
the cattle from Burma, but the traders have been smuggling the cattle
into Bangladesh by either giving hefty bribes to the naval and Nasaka
border guard forces, or risking the open sea and arrest to get the
cattle across the border.

[This Myanmar/Burma-Bangladesh border story is interesting on 2 counts:

(1) the economic impact on a neighbouring country of this anthrax
epidemic in Bangladesh;

(2) but more significantly, confirmation of a long known problem of
infected Myanmar cattle crossing into adjoining countries. There have
been a series of livestock and human anthrax outbreaks in Thailand,
nominally free of anthrax, ascribed to Myanmar cattle, sheep and goats
sold in Thai district markets along the Myanmar border. With all its
present problems, the Bangladesh government does not need to import
sick and infection-incubating animals from Myanmar. - Mod.MHJ]
