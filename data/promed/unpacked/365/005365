The Hong Kong Jockey Club said on Wednesday it was temporarily suspending
the import of horses from North America due to the outbreak of West Nile
[virus infections in New York.
"This is a precautionary measure to prevent the possibility of the virus
responsible for the fatal neurological disease from getting into the local
mosquito population and infecting people, birds and animals in Hong Kong,"
it said.
The Hong Kong Jockey Club said a testing programme has been introduced to
identify horses that have been exposed to the virus. "This will enable
importation of horses into Hong Kong from the United States to resume as
soon as it is considered safe to do so," it said. It gave no indication
when that might be.

enzootic in certain parts of Asia. Of course, there are not many horses in
much of Asia. - Mod.CHC
