Yet another person has been infected by the _Escherichia coli_ [O103 -
Mod.LL] bacterium. This brings to 15 the number of Norwegians who've fallen
ill, probably because they ate contaminated meat.
Norwegian health authorities reported on Mon 27 Mar 2006 that a man in his
30s from Hedmark County is being treated in a local hospital. He became ill
with bloody diarrhea on 13 Mar 2006 [but has not] suffered kidney trouble
like many of the other victims, most of them children.
The authorities aren't sure yet whether he also ate the sausage known as
Sognemorr produced by Norwegian meat company Gilde, which has been
identified as a source of the _E. coli_ bacteria. They hope to be able to
interview him later in the day.
Even though the source of the contamination is believed to have been
identified and publicized, and suspect meats withdrawn from stores,
officials say they can't rule out more illness. The infection has an
incubation time of up to a week.

The dangerous _E. coli_ O103 bacteria which sent 14 children to hospital
earlier in Mar 2006, has now been found in the cured sausage Sognemorr
(spekepoelse) produced by Gilde. This has been announced by the Public
Health Institute and the Food Inspectorate. 2 separate analyses of meat
from unopened packages of Sognemorr, confirmed that the meat contained the
_E. coli_ O103 bacterium.
The Food Inspectorate has since Mon 20 Mar 2006, suspected that cured
sausage from the Gilde Terina plant in Sogndal has been the source of the
_E. coli_ outbreak, and ordered the withdrawal of the sausage from shops.
Earlier the main suspect was ground beef from Gilde, and the Inspectorate
has still not [ruled out that possibility]. However, it says this now seems
a less likely source.

Norwegian officials who asked people to throw away ground beef this winter
now believe an outbreak of the _E. coli_ [O103 - Mod. LL] bacterium is tied
to specialty sausage meats.
Officials from Norway's Food Safety Authority say most of the people who
have fallen ill ate sliced sausage called spekepolse, Aftenposten reported
Mon, 20 Mar 2006. The sausage meats now under question are distributed
throughout Norway.
Authorities believe the source of the _E. coli_ infections, which have left
several children with kidney failure, is the Gilde Terina plant in Sogndal.
More than 60 per cent of the meat produced there is sold in the areas where
most people have fallen ill, the newspaper said.
But food safety officials say they have not yet cleared Gilde's plant at
Rudshogda, which produces the ground beef initially targeted as the source
of the infection. A spokesman said more detailed information is expected
this week.

[ProMED-mail posted the original report on the outbreak of
verotoxin-producing _E. coli_ (VTEC) O103. This moderator has followed the
subsequent reports over the past week that have implicated a spiced sausage
produced by the same company at a different plant. It is possible that both
meat products had a role in the outbreak. - Mod.LL]
