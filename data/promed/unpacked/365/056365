Vietnam to Vaccinate Poultry Nationwide
----------------------------------------
Vietnam said Wednesday [29 Jun 2005] it will begin vaccinating
poultry nationwide against bird flu in August.

Vaccinations will begin 1 Aug 2005 at commercial poultry operations
and smaller household farms in northern Nam Dinh province and
southern Tien Giang province in the Mekong Delta, said Bui Quang Anh,
head of Vietnam's animal health department.

Vaccinations will be slowly expanded to another 40 high-risk
provinces in the next 2 years, he said. An initial 20 million doses
of vaccines will be imported from the Netherlands and China.

Bird flu began ravaging poultry farms across Vietnam in late 2003,
killing or forcing the slaughter of more than 45 million birds. The
virus began jumping to humans at about the same time, and has killed
38 people in Vietnam, 12 in Thailand and 4 from Cambodia.

"Good preparation will be key to the success of this effort," Anh
said at a news conference. "We cannot afford to allow something bad
to happen. If the vaccinations are not closely monitored, the virus
could change."

Most human cases have been linked to contact with sick birds. But
health experts worry the virus will mutate over time and spread
easily from person to person, potentially causing a pandemic.

A team of virologists and epidemiologists from Hong Kong, Japan,
Britain and the United States in Vietnam last week discovered no
changes in the form of the virus, according to the World Health
Organization [WHO], which coordinated the visit.

"That's very good news," said Hans Troedsson, head of the WHO in
Hanoi, adding that experts "also concluded that they could not verify
that the virus was spreading among people. ... They did not detect
new cases."

There were some suspicions that the H5N1 strain of bird flu virus had
changed because of recent clusters of human cases with patients
showing no symptoms of illness. The rate of mortality in bird flu
patients has also been much lower than in previous outbreaks.

Earlier this week, the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization [FAO]
said test results showed that some chickens infected with the virus
did not show any symptoms of illness.

"Among poultry, this is correct that the virus is causing some milder
asymptomatic infections. That is, of course, worrisome. ... It's more
difficult to control the infection in poultry," Troedsson said.

The 2-year poultry vaccination program will cost 35 million USD, said
To Long Thanh, also with Vietnam's Department of Animal Health.

The government will subsidize 29 million USD and the rest will come
from fees charged to large commercial operators. Household farmers
will get their chickens vaccinated for free, he said.

[If the plan outlined above is realised, Viet Nam will become Asia's
3rd country which officially applies vaccination against HPAI,
following China and Indonesia. Details on the candidate vaccines, the
vaccination scheme including species (waterfowl in addition to
chickens?) and age of the vaccinees, and the laboratory-backed
follow-up, if contemplated, will be helpful. Subscribers are referred
