UPDATE: Finland restricts fish movement to stop VHS
---------------------------------------------------
[This article adds information on quarantine extension and rules. ­ Mod.TG
The Aland Islands and an area in eastern Uusimaa, Finland have been
quarantined in an attempt to stop the spread of the fish disease VHS (Viral
Hemorrhagic Septicemia). The Finnish ministry of agriculture and forestry
has decided to extend the restricted areas to include all of the Aland
Islands, while the restricted area in Pyttis remains the same.
It is illegal to take living rainbow trout and roe from the restricted
areas. So far, 2 cases of the disease have been found on fish farms in
Pyttis in Uusimaa and 4 cases in the Aland Islands.
Equipment used for living farmed fish or the remains of such fish has to be
cleaned and disinfected before it is allowed to leave the restricted area,
according to STT-FNB, a Finnish news agency. It has been suggested the fish
from fish farms have become infected from wild fish.
