[From 12 Aug 2013 to 30 Jun 2015, which was the date of the final report sent to the OIE (http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapEventSummary&reportid=16264), Greece reported a total of 162 outbreaks of sheep pox. The event summary and interactive map can be seen at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?reportid=13928.

While during the previous sheep pox event in Greece (2014) their report indicated that only sheep were clinically affected in mixed sheep/goat flocks, there is no differentiation in the current OIE notification between data from both species. In neighboring Turkey, both sheep pox and goat pox are endemic. It will be helpful to note if clinical cases have been observed in goats as well or only in sheep, during the current event in Lesbos (a Greek island adjacent to the Turkish coast). - Mods.AS/CRD
