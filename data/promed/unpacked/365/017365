----------------------------------------------------------------------
An ongoing outbreak in Hesse and North Rhine-Westphalia reminds us
that Q-fever is no stranger to Germany.

The following review is abstracted from the Gideon e-book series.
[1,2] The primary references are available on request.

Time and place
--------------
Q-fever was first recognized in Germany in 1947.
- Reporting was instituted in West Germany in 1962, and in East
Germany in 1979. The 2 systems were combined in 1991.
- Most cases are reported in Bavaria, Baden-Wurttemberg,
Rhineland-Palatinate, Hesse, North Rhine-Westphalia, and Thuringia.
- Hesse has experienced the greatest increase in incidence since
1990.

Outbreaks peak during spring to summer, and may be related to
urbanization.
- 40 outbreaks were reported during 1947 to 1999. Sheep were
implicated in 24 of the outbreaks, and cattle in 6.
- 2 laboratory outbreaks (in 1947 and 1948) were reported during 1947
to 1999.

Reported rates of Q-fever in Germany are summarized in the graph at
<http://www.gideononline.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/Qfever-Germany.jpg>.

Additional notes
----------------
1. The mean rate was 0.08 per 100 000 during 1979 to 1989; 0.14 per
100 000 during 1990 to 1999 (0.31 in Baden Wurttemberg).
2. 3 cases of travel-associated Q-fever were reported in Germany --
acquired in Sri Lanka, Sudan, and the Sahara desert (2007
publication).

Prevalence surveys
------------------
- 0 percent of rodents and _Ixodes ricinus_ ticks in Stuttgart (2008
publication).
- 1.9 percent of _Ixodes ricinus_ in central Germany, often in
association with _Borrelia_, _Babesia_, or spotted fever-group
rickettsiae (2006 to 2007).

Seroprevalence surveys
----------------------
- 22 percent of blood donors are seropositive (nationwide, 1983 to
1986).
- 22 percent of military personnel (1985 to 1987).
- 0 percent of Vietnamese refugees in Germany (1980 publication).
- 12 percent of cattle in the southern Bavarian foothills.
- 0.9 percent of 10.2 percent of sheep in Baden-Wurttemberg (2004
publication).

The average number of cattle reported herds infected with Q-fever was
71 per year during 1971 to 1979; 328 during 1980 to 1989; 303 during
1990 to 1998.
