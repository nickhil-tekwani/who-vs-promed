During the past 10 days, 2 boys and a 7-month old girl died because
of diarrheal disease, the sanitation authorities announced today [Wed
1 Feb 2006]. Dr.Mario Serpas, epidemiologist from the Ministry of
Health, stated that laboratory examinations are being carried out in
order to confirm whether these deaths were associated rotavirus
infection. The infants died in Benjamin Bloom Hospital in the Capital
City, where physicians and nurses assured that symptoms the infants
presented with suggest the presence of rotavirus infection.
Rotavirus caused the death of 21 children in the first months of
2005, while thousands of patients survived the infection. Even though
authorities assured that the problem is under control, during January
this year, 20 000 persons attended health centers looking for medical
care because of diarrheal diseases. Only last Sunday [29 Jan 2006]
585 patients were taken care of, and the figures are rising,
according to many clinicians.
Last year, because of the magnitude of the epidemics, the Health
Ministry declared a state of emergency in many regions of the
country. However, this time, the health authorities only issued
statements directed to parents, requesting them to keep an eye on
their children, since diarrheal diseases are more frequent at this
time of the year, and they may lead to weight loss because of dehydration.
