This event pertains to a defined zone within the country.

New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks:
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1: Jasper County, Jasper, Missouri
Date of start of the outbreak: 26 Apr 2016
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: farm
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Birds / 39 000 / - / 0 / 39 000 / 0
Affected population: commercial turkey flock

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Birds / ** / 0 / ** / 100
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter
** Not calculated because of missing information

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comment
The USDA Animal Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) and the Missouri Department of Agriculture are conducting a comprehensive epidemiological investigation and have implemented enhanced surveillance and testing related to this event. Samples were initially collected from healthy, non-clinical turkeys as part of the routine, pre-slaughter surveillance that is done under the National Poultry Improvement Plan (NPIP) Avian Influenza Clean Program (H5 and H7). Through this routine surveillance, H5N1 low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) of North American wild bird lineage was identified and confirmed by partial HA/NA sequence. HA sequence is 98% similar to A/mallard/Ohio/11OS2229/2011(H5); amino acid sequence = NIPQRETR/GLFGAI. NA sequence is 99% similar to A/blue-winged teal/Louisiana/UGAI14-2494/2014(N1).

Control measures
Measures applied: movement control inside the country; quarantine; stamping out; surveillance within containment and/or protection zone; zoning; vaccination prohibited; no treatment of affected animals

Measures to be applied: disinfection/disinfestations; official disposal of carcasses, by-products and waste

Diagnostic test results:
Laboratory name and type:
National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) (national laboratory)
Species / Test / Test date / Result
Birds / real-time reverse transcriptase/polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) / 30 Apr 2016 / Positive
Birds / virus sequencing / 30 Apr 2016 / Positive
Birds / virus isolation / - / Pending

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[The following information was obtained from the USDA's fact sheet on "Avian Influenza" (updated April 2015) available at http://www.usda.gov/documents/usda-avian-influenza-factsheet.pdf

"There are 2 types of avian influenza (AI) that are identified as H5N1. A difference exists in the virus classification; one is low pathogenic (LPAI) and the other is highly pathogenic (HPAI). Pathogenicity refers to the ability of the virus to produce disease. HPAI H5N1, often referred to as the Asian H5N1, is the type causing worldwide concern. LPAI H5N1, often referred to as the North American H5N1, is of less concern.

LPAI H5N1 (North American H5N1): LPAI, or 'low path' AI, commonly occurs in wild birds. In most cases, it causes minor sickness or no noticeable signs of disease. It is rarely fatal in birds. LPAI strains are not known to be a human health concern. This includes LPAI H5N1. Evidence of LPAI H5N1 has been found in wild birds in the United States in recent years and is not closely related to the more severe HPAI H5N1 circulating overseas. Examples of historical reports of LPAI H5N1 received by USDA include:

1975 - LPAI H5N1 was detected in a wild mallard duck and a wild blue goose in Wisconsin as part of routine sampling, not as a result of noticeable illness in the birds.

1981 and 1985 - the University of Minnesota conducted a sampling procedure in which sentinel ducks were monitored in cages placed in the wild for a short period of time, and LPAI H5N1 was detected in those ducks in both years.

1983 - LPAI H5N1 was detected in ring-billed gulls in Pennsylvania.

1986 - LPAI H5N1 was detected in a wild mallard duck in Ohio as part of routine sampling, not as a result of noticeable illness in the birds.

2002 - LPAI H5N1 antibodies were detected in turkeys in Michigan but the virus could not be isolated; therefore, this detection could not be confirmed.

2005 - LPAI H5N1 was detected in ducks in Manitoba, Canada.

2006 - LPAI H5N1 was confirmed in 2 Michigan mute swans and mallard ducks; Maryland resident wild mallard ducks, and Pennsylvania wild mallard ducks; and Delaware green-winged teals, all sampled as part of USDA's expanded avian influenza surveillance.

In the past, there was no requirement for reporting or tracking LPAI H5 or H7 detections in wild birds so states and universities tested wild bird samples independently of USDA. Because of this, the above list of previous detections might not be all inclusive of past LPAI H5N1 detections. However, the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE), from 2006, changed its requirement of reporting detections of avian influenza. Now, all confirmed LPAI H5 and H7 AI subtypes must be reported to the OIE because of their potential to mutate into highly pathogenic strains. Therefore, USDA now tracks these detections in wild birds, backyard flocks, commercial flocks and live bird markets." - Mod.CRD
