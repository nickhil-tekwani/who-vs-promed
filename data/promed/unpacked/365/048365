Dog exposes 2 people to rabies in Florence County [South Carolina]
------------------------------------------------------------------
Two people in Florence County have been referred to their health care providers after being potentially exposed to rabies by a pet dog that tested positive for the disease, the Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC) reported on Wednesday [9 Nov 2016].

According to DHEC, the dog began exhibiting unusual vocalizations and aggression around mid-October [2016]. The victims were subsequently exposed to saliva while trying to provide care for the animal. The dog died on 30 Oct [2016], and was submitted to DHEC's laboratory for testing on 1 Nov [2016]. The animal was confirmed to have rabies on 2 Nov [2016]. The dog was not current on its rabies vaccination.

Experts say keeping your pets updated on their rabies vaccination is one of the easiest and most effective ways you can protect yourself, your family and your pets from the disease. Pets, particularly those that stay outdoors, have the potential to come in contact with wild or stray animals. If unexplainable, visible wounds are found on your pet, immediately seek veterinary treatment.

The dog is the 1st animal in Florence County to test positive for rabies this year [2016], but there have been 89 confirmed cases of animal rabies statewide [in South Carolina].

Rabies confirmed in cats in Lower Saucon Township, Northampton County [Pennsylvania]
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Two cases of rabies in cats have been confirmed recently in Lower Saucon Township, according to police there. Both have been in the area of Dartford Road, off Black River Road, and one resident was bitten by one of the rabid felines, township police said in a news release on Thursday night [10 Nov 2016].

[Clinical] rabies is nearly always fatal, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] says. Strays or unwanted animals that attack a person or pet should be confined and observed for 10 days or be euthanized and tested for rabies immediately. The latter goes for skunks, raccoons, foxes and bats that bite humans, says CDC.

According to township police: "There are 2 common types of rabies in cats. Furious rabies is characterized by extreme behavioral changes, including overt aggression and attack behavior. Paralytic rabies, also referred to as dumb rabies, is characterized by weakness and loss of coordination in the cat, followed by paralysis." Police advise townships residents who encounter a cat behaving strangely to stay away from it and call the department. Police may be reached via 911 or the Northampton County dispatch non-emergency line at 610-759-2200. Rabies is spread through saliva or brain/nervous system tissue, the CDC says. Anyone bitten by an unfamiliar or wild animal is urged to wash any wounds immediately and seek medical treatment for any trauma due to the attack before considering the need for rabies prophylaxis.

Post-exposure vaccination consists of 5 doses administered in the arm, like a flu or tetanus vaccine.

Three new human rabies exposures reported in Weld County [Colorado]
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Though it's been a mild year for rabies outbreaks, Weld County still has its share. A little more than a week ago, 1 adult and 2 children in unincorporated south east Weld County were either bitten or scratched by a rabid feral cat.

"We are warning people to not touch or go near wild animals," said Dr Mark Wallace, executive director of the Weld County Health Department, in a news release. "It's also vital to vaccinate pets such as dogs and cats, including horses. Even pets such as outdoor barn cats should be vaccinated." The 3 exposed individuals are receiving a preventative rabies treatment, according to Eric Aakko, spokesman for the health department.

All mammals, including humans, are at risk for contracting rabies. "The risk of human exposure to rabies increases when pets and domestic animals are not properly vaccinated," said Wallace. Rabies can infect many wild animals, including foxes, raccoons, coyotes and bats. Health officials stress that all domestic animals such as cats, dogs, horses and livestock should be vaccinated against rabies by a licensed veterinarian. Unvaccinated horses and bison have also contracted rabies in northern Colorado, the release stated.

So far in 2016, 3 bats, 1 cat, and 1 skunk have tested positive for rabies in Weld County, Aakko said. "Rabies is endemic to the Front Range -- sometimes we have worse cases, and sometime they are milder. This year has been fairly mild," Aakko said. "Previous years we've had up to [a] dozen different skunks, bats, and raccoons being found and tested positive. But it's here. We're not surprised when we see rabies, it's here, in the wild animal population, and we're going to have it here as long we have wild animals."

Signs of rabies include increases in saliva and drooling, nocturnal animals seen out during the daytime, and slow or difficult movement. Other signs may be aggressive behavior, such as a skunk attacking a dog, the release stated. Rabies is a disease caused by a virus that affects the nervous system. Rabies causes inflammation of the brain and spinal cord and is nearly always fatal. It is transmitted in saliva through the bite of an infected animal. The virus can also be transmitted in saliva to an open cut, scratch or wound.

If a person suspects they have been exposed to rabies, they should contact their medical provider immediately. Effective vaccination treatment is available to prevent rabies if started before symptoms appear.

With 3 reports, flush with advice, I will limit myself to the obvious. Make sure your pet dogs and cats are vaccinated, and don't mess with sick animals which are not your own and especially wildlife. If you suspect a case, call the police. They know what to do and whom to call in to catch the animal. If you are bitten or scratched, go to emergency health ASAP. If the animal is confirmed rabid, you should be contacted in order to make sure you have been vaccinated. As a field veterinarian, I used to ensure I was regularly vaccinated every 3 years as I never knew when I might knowingly or unknowingly meet up with a rabid bat, skunk, whatever, and over the years I have, starting with a colony of infected Mexican free-tailed bats in a slave quarter in the New Orleans [Louisiana, USA] French Quarter when I was a grad student. They were in the ceiling space above a 4 inch [10cm] layer of bat guano that I had cut up through. I now have a good antibody titre which my doctor checks routinely. - Mod.MHJ
