The 2004 Nipah Virus Outbreak in Bangladesh
-------------------------------------------
Although Nipah virus first surfaced in Malaysia in 1998 with a mortality
rate of 40 percent, it reappeared in Bangladesh with greater lethality. WHO
reports that in February 2004, an outbreak of Nipah virus spread across 6
districts of Bangladesh and claimed 17 human lives of 23 cases -- a
mortality rate of 74 percent. A 2nd outbreak in the Faridpur district
killed 18 of a total 30 cases -- a 60 percent mortality rate -- as of 19
Apr 2004.
Nipah virus, inducing influenza-like symptoms often leading to encephalitis
and coma, came into view when it jumped from infected pigs in Malaysia to
humans, killing both. The virus was named after the Malaysian village where
it was first discovered. Of 265 confirmed cases in Malaysia and Singapore,
105 died. And even among the survivors, the virus has taken a horrendous
toll: many of the survivors were left with some degree of brain damage. To
contain the spread of the disease the Malaysian authorities killed over a
million pigs. Currently it is believed that fruit bats (also known as
"flying foxes") serve as the virus reservoir, based on the finding of
natural Nipah viral antibody in healthy fruit bats. Virus has been isolated
from the urine of fruit bats. Normally, flying foxes live deep in the
jungle, feeding off succulent fruit like jambu air [also known as Jambu
mawar, water apple, or rose apple, a small red succulent fruit with pink or
white flesh] and mango. Local hunters shoot and eat them. In Cambodia, they
are prized as aphrodisiacs, and the bats are used as good luck talismans in
Filipino wedding ceremonies.
So, how did the pig acquire the virus? Researchers have tried to link the
emergence of Nipah virus to El Nino. During 1997-1998, El Nino brought
drought and dry weather to the Indonesian peninsula, which led to massive
forest fires and the haze that shrouded the region for months.
Consequently, haze blocked sunlight, reducing the ability of trees to
flower and bear fruit. This forced fruit bats to travel great distances in
search of sustenance. They settled in places outside their usual habitat
such as the fringes of forests, close to pig farms. They may have passed
the virus on to pigs via their urine, as well as their saliva in the
half-eaten fruit that fell to the ground and was then eaten by the
voracious pigs. The presence of Nipah virus antibodies indicate that bats
were infected with the virus, as were pigs, cats, and dogs. In the
Malaysian outbreak, pigs were the apparent source of infection for most
human cases: 93 percent of the confirmed cases had occupational exposure to
pigs. In contrast, pigs farming is uncommon in the outbreak areas in
Bangladesh. That implies that other intermediary sources other than pigs
were the source of infection.
In the recent Bangladesh outbreak, fruit bats are also the suspected
reservoir for Nipah virus. A significant number of victims in Bangladesh
were under age 19. It has been hypothesized that young boys may have
collected and eaten fruits harvested from trees [in the early morning] and
could have contracted infection by eating the same fruits that fruit bats
fed on during the night. in addition many of the cases in Bangladesh have
occurred within households -- with victims having had no direct contact
with animals or bats. This implicates that human-to-human transmission
might be possible, which is a matter of great concern. However,
human-to-human transmission of Nipah virus had not been reported in the
Malasyian outbreak.

[While this article provides a useful summary of the 2004 outbreak of Nipah
virus infection in Bangladesh, it may be premature to conclude that
person-to-person transmission occurred -- in this outbreak in the absence
of reliable information concerning both the reservoir host and the actual
route of transmission. Transmission of infection within households may be
indicative of a common source of infection, which could be fruit or bat
urine-contaminated material rather than a single infected human family
member. - Mod.CP]
