A fresh outbreak of the deadly bird flu virus in the northern Thai city of
Chiang Mai may have been accidentally triggered by research being conducted
on the disease, Thai officials said.
Chiang Mai University has notified authorities that several chickens,
geese, ducks and other birds fell ill and died this week, prompting the
culling of some 1000 poultry inside and near the university's campus.
Deputy Agricultural Minister Newin Chidchob said Thursday that it appeared
research at the campus farm may have led to the outbreak.
"The discovery might have been caused by research into preventing the
disease and the production of medicine," Newin told reporters, adding the
breakout was relatively small and did not qualify as an epidemic.
"We might have been concerned if it was found at a private farm, but it was
found at a university farm," he said.
The minister said surveillance teams had been set up within a radius of one
kilometer (around half a mile) of the area and that the world body
responsible for classifying the bird flu status of nations had been
informed of the outbreak. [See item 1 above].
"Thailand has informed the OIE (World Organisation for Animal Health) about
the new bird flu outbreak discovered at the university's farm," he said,
adding he did not expect the latest infections to affect Thai poultry exports.
Thailand slaughtered at least 36 million chickens and other poultry and
slapped quarantine regulations on affected zones earlier in 2004 in an
effort to halt the spread of avian influenza, which hit 41 of its 76
provinces including Chiang Mai.
At least 12 people were infected with the disease, of whom 8 died. The 4
others made a full recovery. The disease swept through 10 countries in Asia
and also killed 16 people in Viet Nam.
Thailand, whose billion-dollar poultry industry was devastated by the
outbreak, planned several times to declare itself free of bird flu
following an initial wave of outbreaks in January, but was forced to
backtrack when more cases were announced.
Earlier in May 2004, Agriculture Minister Somsak Thepsuthin said the
country had no more bird flu outbreak area "red zones", but stopped short
of declaring the kingdom free of the virus.
He gave farms that passed the mandatory quarantine period the green light
to begin restocking their chickens, but a ban on the import of Thai chicken
is still being observed by the European Union, which is due to review its
stance in August 2004.

[The following points are in need of clarification.
1. Allegedly, the outbreak "might have been caused by research into the
production of medicine". A vaccine? In a previous posting, a demand for
vaccine was expressed by a farmer. It will be interesting to note whether
the Thai authorities contemplate the production/use of a vaccine.
2. Among the affected population mentioned in the Thai follow-up report,
ostriches are included. It would be interesting to note whether these
ratites have suffered clinical symptoms, or were killed because of
symptomless infection. In our previous posting, this point was not clear.
One source said that "7 ostriches at the research farm were found dead",
while the other one referred specifically to affected chickens, adding that
"no symptoms or deaths were recorded among various other avian species,
including water fowl".
Information about the disease in ostriches will be valuable; various AI
virus strains have been isolated in recent years from clinically affected
ostriches, in several countries. All but one were not poultry-pathogenic.
The only reported clinical outbreak in ostriches caused by a
poultry-pathogenic strain (HPAI) was recorded in Italy (H7N1). See Capua et
al, 2000. Highly pathogenic avian influenza (H7N1) in ostriches (_Struthio
camelus_): Avian Pathol., 29, 643 - 646. - Mod.AS]
