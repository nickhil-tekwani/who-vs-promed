The Ministry of Health has confirmed 2 new cases of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) in 2 men -- one of them deceased -- residing in the Bierzo region (León), according to a new report prepared by the Center for Coordination of Health Alerts and Emergencies.

The 1st case is a 49-year-old hunter with a history of bites from tick, who began having symptoms on 12 Jul 2022 and is in a stable situation. The 2nd case, aged 51, was diagnosed retrospectively on 20 Jul 2022, after having died on 19 Jun 2022 due to an unknown cause with suspected poisoning by sulfur compounds.

Between 2013 and 2022 a total of 12 cases have been confirmed with 4 deaths in Spain: 1 in 2013 in Ávila, 2 in 2016, one of them in Ávila and a secondary case to this in a health worker, 2 in 2018 in Badajoz and Salamanca, 3 in 2020 in Salamanca, 2 in 2021 in Salamanca and León (el Bierzo) and the 2 that have just been published, corresponding to 2022 and occurring in El Bierzo.

It is not the 1st time that it has been detected in El Bierzo. On 10 Jun 2021, another case was confirmed in a woman resident in El Bierzo who had also been to some places in Ourense, around the Ribera Sacra, Galicia. However, the Ministry of Health affirms that the "risk is moderate" in this area.

For the rest of Spain, the risk is considered "low", although remember that this is conditional on the activity of the vectors, whose activity is maximum in the summer season.

CCHF virus was identified for the 1st time in Spain in 2010, in ticks captured on deer from a game farm in Cáceres, on the edge of the Tagus River on the Portuguese border. A subsequent study carried out in various areas of the country, in different tick species (2053) obtained from livestock and vegetation and serum from people exposed to ticks in Cáceres (114) and La Rioja (114), did not show the presence of the virus in any sample.

In another study carried out between 2011 and 2015, 1579 ticks were sampled in wild and domestic ungulates in Cáceres, Toledo, Segovia and Huesca. Given the detection of the 1st 2 human cases of CCHFv in 2016, a 3-phase study was launched to assess the status and risk of CCHFv infection in Spain.

According to the report on 18 Jul 2022, Castilla y León communicated to the Center for Coordination of Sanitary Alerts and Emergencies and the National Center of Epidemiology a suspicion of (a case of) Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF).

He is a 49-year-old man, a hunter and resident in Ponferrada (Bierzo region, León) with a history of tick bites. On 12 Jul 2022 he began to suffer from gastrointestinal symptoms (abdominal pain, diarrhea and vomiting) along with headache and fever.

On 16 Jul 2022, he was hospitalized with elevation of transaminases and thrombocytopenia. And on 19 Jul 2022, the National Center of Microbiology (CNM) confirmed by real-time PCR the positivity against CCHF virus (CCHFV). The case was transferred on 20 Jul 2022 to the high-level isolation unit in Donostia where he is progressing satisfactorily.

Regarding the 2nd case, the Ministry of Health informs that on 20 Jul 2022 the National Institute of Toxicology and Forensic Sciences sent to the CNM, a positive real-time PCR result against CCHFV in blood. The case reported no history of tick bite, but he had been treating his orchard with sulphate and 24 hours later he began to have symptoms. He was initially diagnosed with respiratory infection with headache; subsequently, he developed abdominal discomfort, diarrhea and on 16 Jun 2022 he was admitted with a severe coagulopathy, experiencing progressive deterioration until his death 3 days later.

As a consequence of this case, 4 contacts were identified in those who performed the autopsy and 4 others who handled the samples in the laboratory. Currently, he has completed the follow-up with no secondary cases detected.

Two cases of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) have been confirmed in 2 men residing in the Leon region of El Bierzo, according to a report published on the website of the Ministry of Health and prepared by the Coordination Center of Health Alerts and Emergencies in Spain.

According to the report, the 1st diagnosed case was that of a 49-year-old hunter with a history of tick bites of the _Hyalomma_ species, which transmits the disease. He began to feel symptoms on 12 Jul 2022 and is currently in a stable situation after being admitted to a hospital in the Basque Country.

The 2nd case, which has now been made known, is that of a 51-year-old man, who was retrospectively diagnosed on 20 Jul 2022, after having died on 19 Jun 2022 of an unknown cause with suspected poisoning by sulfur compounds.

After death and after performing various tests, it was determined that he had died of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever.

The CCHF virus is transmitted primarily by ticks of the genus _Hyalomma_, and person-to-person transmission can also occur through contact with the blood or secretions of a sick person.

The report from the Center for Health Alerts and Emergencies also indicates that studies have been carried out on ticks and wild and domestic animals to find out the extent of circulation, having been detected in large areas of Castilla y León, Castilla-La Mancha, Extremadura, and Andalusia.

In addition, they have recently been detected in animal serology studies carried out in Galicia and Catalonia.

The province of León and in particular the Bierzo region was considered low risk, given the low presence of _Hyalomma_ and the low prevalence of antibodies against the virus in wild and domestic animals in the serological studies carried out, in which it was around at 1-2%.

Until 2021, only 10 cases had been detected in Spain and the detection of these 2 new cases grouped over time and in a specific geographic area considered low risk, where another case had also been detected in 2021, justifies the rapid risk assessment carried out by the Center for the Coordination of Health Alerts and Emergencies.

On the other hand, the Center has requested to intensify public health measures in areas with the presence of the virus, especially in the area where cases have been recently detected, emphasizing recommendations to the population for the prevention and management of tick bites, active and passive case surveillance, and entomological study and virus circulation in animals and humans.

Two cases of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) have been confirmed in Spain, specifically in the Bierzo region.

He is a 49-year-old hunter who is currently stable. The 2nd, aged 51, died on 19 Jun 2022 and was retrospectively diagnosed on 20 Jul 2022.

Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a disease caused by a tick-borne virus.

The infection is caused directly by the arachnid bite itself, or by contact with secretions or body fluids of an infected person.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), this virus "is one of the 7 most serious epidemic diseases, and represents a great risk to public health."

Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever is of particular concern due to its high lethality in humans to the point that between 10 and 40% of infections end in death, and because of the lack of effective mitigation measures, in addition to no vaccine being available for people or animals.

This pathology -- endemic in Africa, the Middle East and Asia -- has always been considered an exotic disease in Spain.

However, a recent study by the National Center for Microbiology has detected the virus in ticks in 5 communities on the plateau and southeast of the peninsula.

The origin of this investigation stems from the suspicion that the virus was more widespread than previously thought.

Initially, it was believed that the 1st patient diagnosed with Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever was a man who had been walking in the countryside in Ávila.

However, until then, the virus had only been detected in ticks from Cáceres. Therefore, he was not 'patient zero'.

For this reason, a retrospective study was carried out that places the first infection by this virus in 2013.

This is what emerges from the report 'Widespread detection of multiple strains of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus in ticks, Spain'.

Since then, 8 cases of this disease have been detected in our country: 1 in 2013, 2 in 2018, 3 in 2020 and 2 in 2021.

This epidemiological situation reveals a broader distribution of the disease than previously studied.

After analyzing 12 500 ticks obtained from vegetation and animals, the study -- directed by María Paz Sánchez-Seco, head of the Arbovirus Laboratory at the ISCIII National Center for Microbiology -- has confirmed that the virus is present in Andalusia, Madrid, Castile and Leon, Castile-La Mancha and Extremadura.

"The _Hyalomma_ tick is very abundant in Spain and it is very possible that the virus has been circulating for many years. The reason it has now shown its face may be because of the change in the soil, in the farms...", explains Ángeles Sonia Olmeda, professor at the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine at the Complutense University of Madrid.

However, despite the fact that the health authorities have sounded the alarm, the researcher clarifies that "this tick does not usually bite people, they prefer animal species to man," she tells Searching for Answers.

"This does not mean that bites do not occur, but they are happening in very specific areas of Spain."

Hemorrhagic fever, which is considered an emerging disease in Western Europe, is accompanied by varied symptoms; fever, muscle pain, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and drowsiness. Severe patients may experience rapid renal deterioration or hepatic or pulmonary failure.

In the case of _Hyalomma_ tick bite infection, the main carrier of the virus (although there are more than 30 species capable of transmitting this virus) and present in Asia, Europe and Africa, the incubation period is usually 1 to 3 days, with a maximum of 9.

However, if it is due to contact with fluids from a patient, the period increases from 5 to 6 days, with a maximum incubation period of 13 days.

With an average mortality rate of 30%, the death of the most severe patients occurs in the 2nd week after infection with the virus.

Eight cases of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever have been detected in Spain/Valcárcel and Olmeda.

In those people with good progress, the improvement begins from the 9th day of the disease. Treatment of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever is difficult.

According to the WHO, the antiviral Ribavirin is administered, both orally and intravenously, although it has limited efficacy. Therefore, the way to treat the virus is to alleviate the effects of the symptoms while waiting for the infection to subside on its own.

The specialist is clear: it is not dangerous to go outside or walking in the countryside.

However, it is important "to have that awareness that they have in other countries where there are ticks that transmit diseases."

And for this reason, the 1st thing we must take into account is the type of fabric with which we are dressed:
- Wear protective clothing (long sleeves, long pants, socks).
- Wear light-colored clothing so you can easily spot ticks attached to it.

Regardless of the type of garment, a good exhaustive review after a field day is essential. This review is extended to pets, who must wear antiparasitic collars at all times, which not only protect against tick bites, but also against fleas, mosquitoes or lice.

"It is clear that, if the tick is not attached for a period of more than 24 hours to our body, the chances of transmitting the disease are low."

The Ministry of Health gives the keys to eliminating ticks. Using a simple, fine-tipped tweezers will be more than enough.

You just have to hold the arachnid as close as possible to the surface of the skin with the tweezers and remove it, trying not to separate any part of the body.

"The removal of attached ticks using traditional methods (cotton with alcohol, oil, Vaseline, petroleum, anesthetics, cutting them with scissors, pulling them with your fingers, applying heat, etc.) is not recommended, since they have been considered risky, facilitating the spread of pathogens that they could harbor", officials from the department pointed out.

What happens to pets? The teacher recalls that the use of a protective collar or pipette is the best remedy to prevent tick bites and the lack of it could lead to the spread of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever.

In humans, he stresses, using "anti-mosquito products" are also effective in avoiding 'frights'.

[Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) is considered an emerging or even a probable re-emerging pathogen in southern Europe. The presence of this virus has been reported previously in various regions of Spain with sporadic cases reported every year since 2010.

The transmission potential of CCHF in potential hot spots can be reduced by timely identification of the disease and implementation of barrier-protection and patient-isolation practices. The risk of further human-to-human transmission in hospital settings can be significantly reduced by applying timely appropriate infection prevention and control measures.

Furthermore, enhanced awareness of the importance of early diagnosis and laboratory confirmation should be emphasized among healthcare providers in areas with potential circulation of the CCHF virus. Standard precautions, preferably combined with contact and droplet precautionary measures, should be taken when caring for patients presenting with haemorrhagic fever syndrome. Laboratory tests on patient samples present a high risk of transmission and should only be conducted under appropriate biological containment conditions. - Mod.UBA
