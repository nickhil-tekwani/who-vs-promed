The year's first case of dengue in Mumbai [Bombay has been diagnosed at St.
Elizabeth Hospital. The patient, a 35-year-old woman, resident of Gamdevi,
initially came to Dalvi Hospital with complaints of severe pain, diarrhea
and vomiting. Antibody tests conducted at the laboratory in St. Elizabeth
Hospital confirmed the first recorded case in Mumbai [in 1999 of positivity
to both falciparum malaria and dengue.
According to James D' Costa, senior pathologist at the St. Elizabeth
Hospital, reporting of one such case is not meant to create an alarm.
Nevertheless, as a matter of precaution, physicians in the city should be
made aware that dengue is around, and they need to be alert in their
clinical diagnosis of the disease.
Dengue has made a 'comeback' to Mumbai since 1997. The first time round it
caused a minuscule epidemic. Last year, a few stray cases were reported. But
the trend shows that each time, it has reared its head at the tail end of
the monsoon, in the first week of October, and tapers off by December,
observes Dr. D' Costa.
Dengue is caused by a virus, which is transmitted to humans by a mosquito
called _Aedes aegypti_. The mosquito breeds in clean as well as in stagnant
water. There are 4 strains of the virus. When a person is infected for the
first time by a particular strain of dengue, the symptoms are identical to
influenza and the dengue virus usually passes unnoticed.
The problem, however, arises when the same person, who was infected in the
past, is subsequently attacked by another strain of the virus. Then, the
patient suffers an enhanced reaction, wherein the system reacts violently to
the second strain of dengue. This could lead to the dengue hemorrhagic
syndrome or dengue shock syndrome.
At such times a patient should not consume aspirin, thinking he has fever
due to influenza, as that could trigger a brain hemorrhage. In any case, the
symptoms would be severe enough to warrant summoning of a doctor. Although
there is no specific treatment for dengue, prompt diagnosis by the physician
and adequate hospital support enables a patient to recover from the attack.
According to Dr D'Costa, Mumbai cannot afford to be complacent about dengue.
A study conducted by him in 1997 found that of the 200 patients randomly
tested in the city, 70 per cent had significant IgG antibody levels to
dengue. This meant that the antibody test applied for dengue showed that
they had been exposed to a primary attack of dengue. As the symptoms are
mild pain and fever, a case of influenza is presumed.
"Mumbai is sitting on a ticking time bomb if a second strain of dengue
spreads to the city. This is perfectly possible, when dengue cases have
already been reported from Ludhiana during September-end this year. Serious
cases of dengue may then flare up, and they should not be missed, because
they can cause a high fatality'', says Dr. D' Costa.
According to Nandkumar Parde of the Dalvi Hospital, the patient he referred
to the St Elizabeth Hospital did not show any obvious clinical symptoms of
dengue. Suspicion arose on seeing the severe drop in blood platelets [the
first sign of dengue hemorrhagic fever. The dengue antibody test is
expensive, around Rupees1000, and beyond the reach of the poor. Doctors in
the city have, however, undergone training in clinical diagnosis of dengue
cases and should be in a position to respond with timely and accurate
treatment, he says.

[As Mod.CHC keeps reminding us, a single antibody test result does not prove
that a person had dengue, & in this case the patient´s fever could have been
just due to the malaria. However, the warning is timely, given the history
of outbreaks since 1997. Perhaps someone can tell us what strain of dengue
affected the city the last 2 years, and will isolate & type this year´s
strain - Mod.JW
