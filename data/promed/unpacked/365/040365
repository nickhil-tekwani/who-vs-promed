The Health Ministry has formed primary teams to carry out extensive medical
follow-ups on viral encephalitis (VE) patients who had been discharged,
especially those formerly infected with the Nipah or Hendra-like virus.
Its minister Datuk Chua Jui Meng said the teams would only be available at
hospitals with VE patients and would be headed by the chief physician or
the chief neurologist wherever available. "This is the first time we are
facing the Nipah virus and we need to have as much information such as the
clinical features of the disease, we want to know what happens during the
acute phase of the patients' illness and after their discharge," he said.
It would also help the doctors and rehabilitation teams to monitor the
patients' recovery, late complications and possible reactivation of the
viruses, Chua told reporters.
The follow-up exercise would be carried out for one year with the first
five follow-ups to be done on a monthly basis while the sixth follow-up
would be done on the ninth month. "The seventh follow-up will be done 12
months after discharge," said Chua, adding that patients would be assessed
on their general health, functional status, whether there were damaged or
dysfunctional organs as well as their psychological well-being.
Chua said the ministry knew the danger posed by the Hendra virus [in
Australia based on an incident involving a patient who died 13 months
after being discharged from hospital.
The minister also said the cabinet, at its weekly meeting last week, had
decided to set up a permanent council for zoonotic diseases but declined to
reveal more details when asked.
In a related development, Chua denied a local newspaper report today which
said that a pig farm worker at Seelong, 20 kilometres from Johor Bahru [in
the southernmost Johor state, fell into a coma and was now in the
intensive care unit of the Sultanah Aminah Hospital. Chua said he had
checked and found no such case existed and wanted the story which appeared
on the front page of the newspaper to be corrected immediately as it would
cause undue alarm among the public.
