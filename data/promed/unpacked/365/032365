The online publication in the Archives of Pathology and Laboratory
Medicine (as described in PRO/AH> Bacillus cereus, anthrax-like
infection - USA: (TX) publication 20110815.2470) detailed the genetic
analysis of a strain of _Bacillus cereus_ containing a plasmid quite
similar to the pXO1 plasmid of _B. anthracis_ which caused a rapidly
progressive, fatal, inhalation anthrax-like illness. It is not stated
in the report when the case occurred. The victim resided in Texas and
was a welder. Cases like the described case have occurred before, but
what made the report unique was the rapid genome sequencing to define
the strain, concluding that bioterrorism was not an issue.

If the bacterium causing the current Minnesota case has been
identified as _B. anthracis_, then it is not likely that the case
represents a _B. cereus_ case, since the 2 species can be reasonably
easily differentiated by standard microbiological testing.

A 2004 PNAS report (1) describes _B. cereus_ G9241, one of several
past isolates of the organism, causing unusually severe lung disease
and which found, as in the above publication, that it was very similar
to _B. anthracis_. G9241 had been isolated from a Louisiana welder in
1994. In 1996, 2 additional cases in Texas metal workers were reported
as well as an environmental isolate (2). One of the isolates was
clinically indistinguishable from the Louisiana case. The clinical
isolates possessed a capsule, but it was not the anthrax
poly-D-glutamic acid capsule. The Texas cases were described in
clinical form in 2007 (3). Further evaluation of the G9241 strain,
interestingly, found that despite producing its virulence factors, the
strain behaved more like the attenuated toxigenic nonencapsulated
Sterne strain in rabbits and mice (4). With these cases seemingly
localized to Texas and Louisiana in the USA, an additional isolate was
found from a cluster of anthrax-like deaths that occurred in Cote
d'Ivoire among wild chimpanzees in 2001 and 2002 (5). This strain had
the typical _B. cereus_ chromosomal background with the typical
anthrax virulence plasmids. Importantly, the isolate did not contain
the 4 _B. anthracis_-specific prophage regions and also did not have
the classical nonsense mutation in the regulator gene P1cR. The highly
monophyletic anthrax clade all contain these features (6).

These isolates seem, once again, to nominate Mother Nature as our
world's best bioterrorist. It is, however, not at all clear that the
organism involved in the current Minnesota case is a _B. cereus_
rather than a _B. anthracis_. Hopefully, more information will surface
regarding the Minnesota isolate and whether the individual was also an
iron worker, as were the Texas and Louisiana cases.
