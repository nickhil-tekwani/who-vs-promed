The virus of Aujeszky's disease, or AK for short, was found in a wild boar that was killed in the Emmendingen district [Baden-Württemberg state].

AK, also known as mad itch or pseudorabies because the symptoms resemble those of rabies, is very rare. In Germany, it has been considered eradicated for almost 2 decades -- at least in domestic pigs. From time to time, however, the virus appears in wild boar. This was the case again at the end of May [2022] in eastern Bavaria.

The infected wild boar in the Emmendingen district was shot a few days ago in the state forest near Teningen. Because there was a suspicion of pseudorabies, the district hunters were informed immediately. On Wednesday [8 May 2022], the Friedrich Loeffler Institute (FLI) then confirmed the detection of virus antigen. This was announced by the district office in Emmendingen.

Many mammal species -- but not primates and equidae, that is horse-like -- can become infected. Pigs in particular spread the virus. The virus has disappeared from domestic pigs. In the wild boar population, however, isolated antibodies against the virus of Aujeszky's disease are still being detected -- an indication that the pathogen occurs again and again in wild boar. Older wild boars usually survive the infection, they remain infected for life, as with other herpesvirus infections. The virus can then be excreted again and again. In dogs, cats, and other mammals, the virus causes such severe itching that infected animals die in agony within hours to days.

The state hunting association warns against scaremongering. Aujeszky's disease is not dangerous for humans, but is deadly for dogs and cats, says Sophia Lorenzoni from the hunting association in Stuttgart. The pathogen is repeatedly detected in wild boar. "But these are only isolated cases throughout Germany." Caution is advisable, but the hunters are made aware of it. "At least our members, we've been informing them about it for years."

Hunting dogs are particularly at risk because they can quickly come into contact with dead wild boar, which transmits the disease to the dog through bodily fluids. But they are also well trained -- and they listen to commands. Ordinary family dogs are usually not taught how to deal with game, so it is important that masters and mistresses always keep their dogs on a leash in the forest. "Under no circumstances should dogs run free in the forest," says Lorenzoni. Not just because of the deadly pseudorabies. "It's also breeding and settling time, so consideration for the birds and game is particularly important anyway."

The pseudorabies epidemic should not be confused with African swine fever (ASF), which also appeared in Baden-Württemberg for the 1st time 2 weeks ago. Swine fever is also harmless to humans, but is extremely dangerous for domestic pigs and wild pigs and has been spreading in some EU countries for several years. In Germany, Brandenburg and Saxony in particular have been hit so far.

The infected wild boar was shot in the exclusion zone that was set up around the affected farm in the Emmendingen district because of ASF. In the 10-kilometer [6-mile] restricted area, where dogs are already on a leash due to the ASF, wild boar are increasingly being hunted. Sniffer dogs were also used to search for carcasses. No evidence of infected wild boars was found and the outbreak remained localized to the domestic pig population of the affected farm.

There has been state-wide monitoring in Baden-Württemberg since 2011, in which wild boar are examined for Aujeszky's disease. The samples for this come from the monitoring for the detection of swine fever pathogens. Hunters specifically take blood samples from wild boars that have been shot or run over and send them to the state investigation offices.

According to figures from the wildlife research center in Aulendorf, antibodies against the Aujeszky's virus were found in a total of 44 wild boars in 2020. The focus was on the Hohenlohe and Main-Tauber districts, there were 5 cases in Ravensburg district and 2 in Biberach district. Hound deaths from AK virus are also very rare: 4 have been recorded in the south west since 2009.

[Although most mammals are susceptible to infections with pseudorabies virus (PRV), swine seem to represent the main host reservoir. Due to increased control efforts and the strict implementation of eradication programs, which have included large-scale vaccination and using the strategy of differentiating infected from vaccinated animals, Aujeszky's disease has virtually disappeared from domestic pigs in several parts of Europe.

Reports on PRV-infections of wild boar in Europe are scarce. Serosurveys revealed the occurrence of PRV infections in wild boar in at least 14 European countries, including Belgium, Croatia, the Czech Republic, the former Yugoslavia, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Russia, Slovenia, Spain, and Switzerland, with the average seroprevalence ranging between 0.3% and 66%. - Mod.PMB
