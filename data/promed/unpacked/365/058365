At least 18 people became ill and died in 2 counties in South Sudan's Imatong State recently, and government officials believe meningitis is to blame. Imatong governor Tobolio Alberio told Radio Tamazuj on [Wed 28 Feb 2018] that 18 people died after being afflicted by a disease in Ayachi and Torit East Counties in February [2018], which he said the local doctors have been unable to diagnose.

The top state official further said 7 [fatal] cases were 1st reported in Ayachi County on [Sun 18 Feb 2018], while 11 others were recorded 2 days later in Torit East County. Alberio said the state hasn't confirmed the disease, and that lab tests should soon reveal whether those who died contracted meningitis or not. He added that 18 people died of suspected meningitis but samples have been taken to the laboratory to ascertain the actual cause. "It's still under investigation," he said, continuing "We're not sure yet if the cases are meningitis but the symptoms of the unknown diseases are similar to the symptoms of meningitis." The governor revealed that several people have been admitted to health facilities due to the unknown disease in the state.

[South Sudan became an independent country on 9 Jul 2011. Imatong State, with an estimated population of almost 600 000 residents, is one of the 28 states of South Sudan and is located on South Sudan's southern border with Uganda; Ayachi and Torit East are 2 of Imatong's 12 counties (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imatong_State).

South Sudan is one of the countries in the African "meningitis belt" that stretches from Senegal in West Africa to the Horn of Africa in the east. This region has been plagued yearly by large epidemics of meningococcal meningitis (http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/eid/vol9no10/03-0170.htm). The meningitis outbreaks occur in the dry season (Dec to Apr) and end at the onset of the rainy season (May to Jun). Larger outbreaks occur every 8-12 years (http://wwwn.cdc.gov/travel/yellowBookCh4-Menin.aspx). Attack rates during these cyclic epidemics of meningitis have ranged from 100 to 800 per 100 000 population, but individual communities have reported rates as high as 1000 per 100 000 (http://www.bioline.org.br/request?ms03017).

However, the epidemiology of meningitis in the African meningitis belt changed after preventive mass vaccination of the population with conjugate meningococcal meningitis serogroup A vaccine (MenA) was introduced in 2010. Prevention consisted of vaccinating all those aged one to 29 years in the African meningitis belt with the MenA conjugate vaccine. As of November 2017, more than 280 million people have been vaccinated in 21 African belt countries (http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs141/en/). Subsequently, serogroup A meningococcus has been replaced by other meningococcal serogroups and other bacterial species. A map of the African bacterial meningitis belt can be found at http://www.medic8.com/images/map4-9.gif.

During 2016, preventive campaigns with MenA were conducted for the first time in South Sudan, which covered 37 counties in 6 states (Central Equatoria, Eastern Equatoria, Lakes, Northern Bahr el Ghazal, Warrap and Western Bahr el Ghazal) (http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/254901/1/WER9213.pdf?ua=1). A total of about 4 million people were vaccinated, giving overall administrative coverage of 92 per cent. Imatong was apparently not included.

Although meningitis is suspected on clinical grounds in the Imatong outbreak, laboratory confirmation of the diagnosis and its microbial etiology are still pending. More information from knowledgeable sources on this outbreak would be appreciated.
