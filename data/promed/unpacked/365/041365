Malaysia is considering imposing a quarantine in a small northern
town in the state of Perak as part of efforts to stem a dengue fever
outbreak, a news report said Friday [10 Oct 2008].

Health Minister Liow Tiong Lai said 175 people in the northern
Manjung town were treated for suspected dengue fever from 18 Aug-4
Oct this year [2008], more than double the 77 patients recorded
during the same period last year [2007]. A total of 4 patients have
died from the mosquito-borne disease this year, he said. "We are
seriously considering imposing a quarantine," Liow was quoted as
saying by the New Straits Times daily.

A ministry official confirmed the comments, but declined to give
further details.

Out of the 175 cases, more than half were dengue haemorrhagic fever,
which can be fatal if not treated early, said Liow.

He said there have been a total of 35 227 dengue cases and 78 deaths
nationwide so far this year [2008].

The symptoms of dengue, which is carried by the _Aedes_ mosquito,
include high fever, rashes, headaches, and muscle and joint pain. If
not detected and treated early, the disease can be fatal.

The government has been holding campaigns to educate the public as
well as conduct checks for mosquito-breeding sites on residential and
construction sites to try to stem dengue cases.

Despite the efforts, the number of cases and deaths continues to rise
each year.

[The report of half of the dengue cases being DHF is unusually high.
Perhaps there is substantial under-reporting of total dengue cases.
Usually only 10 percent of dengue cases are DHF. It would be of
interest to know what type of quarantine is contemplated. Strict
quarantine would be an unusual approach to dengue control, and its
implementation would be difficult and of questionable value to halt
dengue virus transmission. - Mods.MPP/TY]

<http://www.medindia.net/news/More-Than-650-Affected-by-Dengue-in-Ludhiana-42825-1.htm>


Over 650 confirmed cases of dengue fever and 2 dengue-related deaths
have been reported in Ludhiana.

A majority of the patients have been admitted to the city's Dayanand
Medical College for treatment against the illness, which is caused by
exposure to the [dengue virus transmitted by] the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito.

Dengue is one of the oldest arthropod-borne diseases known in India.
Its characteristics include severe muscle and joint pains and fever
that can prove fatal in its severest form, i.e. dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF).

"There are more than 300 cases from outside Ludhiana," said Satpal
Sharma, Ludhiana's Chief Medical Officer.

Patients and their relatives are facing a tough time combating the
disease, and they accuse the authorities of being ill equipped to
deal with the problem.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) says that factors like rapid
transportation, industrialization, movement of infected human
populations and mosquitoes and the changing ecology are responsible
for the spread of illnesses like dengue.

A senior official of the Ludhiana Municipal Corporation, S.P.
Ghumman, said: "Fogging (spraying of insecticide) is taking place
properly. The water accumulated in coolers is creating problem.
People are not maintaining proper sanitary conditions in their
houses. The water that accumulates in flower pots and coolers are
creating the problem. We have been saying this through media even. To
tackle this problem, we will start fining people."

Ludhiana saw a similar dengue fever outbreak in 1996, when 720 cases
and 19 deaths were reported.

[This report illustrates the common conflict concerning
responsibility for dengue virus mosquito vector control. The public
is blaming the government. Governmental public health officials blame
the public for not carrying out elimination of breeding sites of
_Aedes_, the dengue virus vectors, despite efforts to inform the
public. A few countries have resorted to inspection of houses and
other buildings with imposition of fines where _Aedes_ breeding sites
have been found.

The city-based virus unit of the Indian Council of Medical Research
(ICMR) has sent a report to the state health department pointing out
that both dengue and chikungunya viruses have been circulating in
Bishnupur II block of South 24-Parganas.

According to the report, cases of dengue and chikungunya have been
confirmed in the same area. If chikungunya and dengue viruses
circulate in a particular area, there are chances of dual infection,
because both viruses are vectored by the same species of mosquito
_Aedes aegypti_. The last time this was witnessed was in 1962. At
that time, a number of people were killed owing to dual infection,
said a health department official.

Vector control measures are the only way to get a grip on the
situation. Last year [2007], these 2 diseases were detected in North
24-Parganas, but they were not circulating in a particular area,
another official added. Dengue and chikungunya experts say that if 2
different strains of dengue virus are in circulation in the state, it
could create a major threat.

The state health department had reportedly asked South 24-Parganas
authorities to carry out proper vector control measures.

report of increased severity of disease in dual dengue-chikungunya
virus infections is interesting. ProMED would appreciate reports of
other such observations where dual infections have occurred.

The change in the climate from hot to rainy in mid-October-November
is believed to cause many illnesses. Section Head of Health Services
(Dinkes) in Batam City Mawardi Badar reminded residents to maintain
their health and increased awareness, especially concerning the
spread of dengue fever.

"I made a circular for the community. The frequency and levels of
rainfall lately have increased. Residents must maintain their
environments and immediately drain places where water accumulates to
avoid the proliferation the vector mosquito," Mawardi said at the
Batam Centre on Wednesday [8 Oct 2008].

According to Mawardi, for all of this past September 2008, the number
of dengue cases in Batam reached 110. This figure was classified as
high compared to previous months.

"The number of dengue cases has been fluctuating, but this past
September [2008], it was moderately high. In October 2008, we also
have made a high prediction.

Mawardi said that residents maintaining an environment free of
mosquito breeding sites is the only effective method of addressing
the increase in dengue cases in Batam.

[There is a chikungunya virus outbreak in this same province on
Karimun, west of Batam (see ProMED archive no. 20081010.3206). One
wonders whether mixed dengue-chikungunya virus outbreaks and
infections will occur in this area.

Fiji's ministry of health says more than 1800 people are now
suffering from dengue fever. The country declared a dengue outbreak
on 2 Sep [2008].

The ministry's director of primary preventative health services, Dr
Losevati Alefaio, says it's affecting everyone, and the youngest
victim is a 2-month-old baby.

"We had a total of 1849 cases. That's for the whole of Fiji. It still
hasn't moved away from the central division and the western division.
That's where the cases are mostly."

Dr Losevati Alefaio says the ministry is spraying and running public
awareness campaigns but adds the public must get rid of water
containers where larvae breed and wear insect repellent at all times.

Dengue is a major health problem in tropical and subtropical regions.
In Colombia, dengue viruses (DENV) cause about 50 000 cases annually,
10 percent of which involve dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock
syndrome. The picture is similar in other surrounding countries in
the Americas, with recent outbreaks of severe disease mostly
associated with DENV serotype 3 strains of the Indian genotype
introduced into the Americas in 1994.

The analysis of the 3'end (224 bp) of the envelope gene from 32
DENV-3 strains recently recovered in Colombia confirms the
circulation of the Indian genotype and, surprisingly, the
co-circulation of an Asian-Pacific genotype only recently described
in the Americas.

These results have important implications for epidemiology and
surveillance of DENV infection in Central and South America.
Molecular surveillance of the DENV genotypes infecting humans could
be a very valuable tool for controlling/mitigating the impact of the
DENV infection.

[It is important to track the movement of dengue virus serotypes and
genotypes and their relationship to the severity of disease.
Unfortunately, most of the information that comes to ProMED does not
mention the serotype of the dengue viruses involved in the reported
outbreaks, much less the genotypes. Dengue viruses and their _Aedes
aegypti_ vector have spread into the inter-Andean valleys in
Colombia, where they were not present 30 and more years ago. The
