Viet Nam: Family tests negative for bird flu
-----------------------------------------------
A Vietnamese family has tested negative for bird flu, a health
official said on Sun 31 Dec 2006, after their hospital admission with
respiratory ailments had sparked fears of a resurgence in human
infections. The mother and her 3 children fell ill a week earlier
after eating a chicken that had died on their farm in Ca Mau, one of
3 southern provinces where the H5N1 strain of the virus has killed
poultry this month [December 2006].
But tests at Ho Chi Minh City's Pasteur Institute found that the
family was not infected with the avian influenza virus, which between
2003 and 2005 killed 42 people in Viet Nam, said the Institute's Dr
Phan Van Tu.
"All 4 people, the mother and her 3 children from Ca Mau province, on
Saturday [30 Dec 2006] tested negative for the H5N1 virus," Tu said.
"They were suffering normal pneumonia."
