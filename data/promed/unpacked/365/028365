Paragonimus in Missouri, United States
--------------------------------------
Physicians at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis,
Missouri, have diagnosed a rare parasitic infection in 6 people who
had consumed raw crayfish from streams and rivers in Missouri. The
cases occurred over the past 3 years, but 3 have been diagnosed since
last September [2009]; the latest in April [2010]. Before these 6,
only 7 such cases had ever been reported in North America, where the
parasite, _Paragonimus kellicotti_, is common in crayfish.

"The infection, called paragonimiasis, is very rare, so it's extremely
unusual to see this many cases in one medical center in a relatively
short period of time," says Washington University infectious diseases
specialist Gary Weil, MD, professor of medicine and of molecular
microbiology, who treated some of the patients. "We are almost certain
there are other people out there with the infection who haven't been
diagnosed. That's why we want to get the word out."

Paragonimiasis causes fever, cough, chest pain, shortness of breath
and extreme fatigue. The infection is generally not fatal, and it is
easily treated if properly diagnosed. But the illness is so unusual
that most doctors are not aware of it. The half-inch, oval-shaped
parasitic worms at the root of the infection primarily travel from the
intestine to the lungs. They also can migrate to the brain, causing
severe headaches or vision problems, or under the skin, appearing as
small, moving nodules.

The recent infections, which occurred in patients ages 10-32, have
prompted the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services to
issue a health advisory alerting doctors across the state. The
department also printed posters warning people not to eat raw crayfish
and placed them in campgrounds and canoe rental businesses near
popular Missouri streams. Thoroughly cooking crayfish kills the
parasite and does not pose a health risk.

Paragonimiasis is far more common in East Asia, where many thousands
of cases are diagnosed annually in people who consume raw or
undercooked crab that contain _Paragonimus westermani_, a cousin to
the parasite in North American crayfish.

[Several _Paragonimus_ species exist throughout the world. The most
common causing human infection, _Paragonimus westermani_, is also
called "the oriental lung fluke." The 1st human case was described in
1979 by Manson in a patient living in Taiwan. It has later been
described throughout Southeast Asia, Central Africa and South America.

However, a recent review states that "Several species of lung flukes
in the genus _Paragonimus_ are local or imported FBT [food-borne
trematodes] in the USA." The endemic cycle occurs in the USA with
various local snails and crustaceans serving as intermediate hosts
(Fried B, Abruzzi A.Food-borne trematode infections of humans in the
United States of America. Parasitol Res. 2010;106:1263-80. Epub 30 Mar
2010).

The present post refers to several cases over the past 3 years, and 3
of these cases have been published previously. The same paper
identified a total of 7 cases described in North America (Lane MA et
al. Human paragonimiasis in North America following ingestion of raw
crayfish. Clin Infect Dis. 2009;49:e55-61). - Mod.EP]
