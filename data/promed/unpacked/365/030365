Romania's veterinary authority said Monday there was "no link " between the
mysterious deaths of hundreds of chickens in the country and Hong Kong's
bird flu which has been blamed for four human fatalities.
"The death of chickens in the east of the country is not caused by the bird
flu nor by any sort of exotic malady, " Liviu Mitrea, the director of the
National Veterinary Health Agency said.
Initial tests said a toxin had been identified in "mouldy corn feed given
to the chickens, " he said, suggesting that the failure of several famers
to vaccinate their chickens could have helped spread the illness.
Teams of veterinarians were currently vaccinating the chickens, he said.
Industrially-raised chickens have been spared.
Specialists initially previously speculated that a mystery virus was being
spread by wild doves and crows.
There have been no reports of anyone being admitted to hospital after
having eaten chicken meat.

[There are a number of non-sequiturs in this communication as I am unaware
of any mycotoxin disease of poultry that can be prevented using a "vaccine"
though obviously a "virus" would synergistically increase the pathogenicity
of mouldy feed. Would anyone with hard information as to the actual
cause(s) and incidence please contact ProMED-mail. - Mod.MHJ]
