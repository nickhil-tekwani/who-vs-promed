*** Cases for which insufficient clinical information was provided.
**** Total number of human cases of WNV illness reported to ArboNET by
state and local health departments.
Neuroinvasive Disease refers to severe disease cases, particularly West
Nile meningitis and West Nile encephalitis.
West Nile fever refers to typically less severe cases that show no evidence
of neuroinvasion.
West Nile fever is not currently on the list of nationally notifiable
diseases, and therefore it is optional whether or not state health
departments report these cases to CDC. Click the above CDC site [URL above]
for further explanations of neuroinvasive West Nile virus disease and West
Nile fever.
Other Clinical includes persons with clinical manifestations other than WN
fever, WN encephalitis or WN meningitis, such as acute flaccid paralysis.
Unspecified cases are those for which sufficient clinical information was
not provided.
Total Human Cases Reported to CDC: These numbers reflect both mild and
severe human disease cases occurring since 1 Jan 2006 reported to ArboNet
by state and local health departments.
ArboNet is the national, electronic surveillance system established by CDC
to assist states in tracking West Nile virus and other mosquitoborne
viruses. Information regarding 2006 virus/disease activity is posted when
such cases are reported to CDC.

2006 West Nile virus activity in the United States (through 10 Oct 2006)
-----------------------------------------------
Data are being collected from state and local health departments on a
weekly basis and are reported to the CDC ArboNET for the following 5
categories: wild birds, sentinel chicken flocks, human cases, veterinary
cases, and mosquito surveillance. Maps detailing county-level wild birds,
sentinel chicken flocks, human cases, veterinary cases, and mosquito
surveillance data are published each week on the collaborative USGS/CDC
West Nile virus website.
As of 10 Oct 2006, human, avian, animal or mosquito WNV infections have
been reported to CDC ArboNET from the following states: Alabama, Arizona,
Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, District of

Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota,
Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New
Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma,
Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota,
Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia,
Wisconsin, and Wyoming.
WN virus antibody-positive sentinel animals (birds and/or horses) have been
found in Arizona, Arkansas, California, Florida, Iowa, Montana, Nevada,
North Carolina, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Utah and Virginia.
WN equine infections have been reported from Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas,
California, Colorado, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky,
Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska,
Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota,
Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia,
Washington, Wisconsin and Wyoming.
WN virus has been detected in dead wild birds in Alabama, Arkansas,
California, Colorado, Delaware, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa,
Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota,
Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New
Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon,
Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia,
West Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.
WN virus has been detected in mosquito pools collected in Arizona,
Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Georgia,
Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts,
Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey,

[ProMED-mail readers should note the change in URL for the USGS/CDC weekly
maps. Maps for other arthropodborne viruses in the USA are covered at this
site also, including St Louis encephalitis, eastern equine encephalitis,
western equine encephalitis, La Crosse encephalitis, and Powassan. The URL
for all these maps is <http://diseasemaps.usgs.gov/>. ProMED-mail thanks
the Cornell Environmental Risk Analysis Program <envrisk@cornell.edu> for
calling to our attention the 13 Oct 2006 issue of the CDC's Morbidity and
Mortality Weekly Report (55(40);1097-1098], which addresses West Nile cases
in the USA and is available online at:
<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5540a4.htm?s_cid=mm5540a4_e>.
There has been a notable increase in WN cases, as well as virus
transmission to sentinel and equine animals and WNV isolation from
mosquitoes in states bordering Mexico, suggesting that WN virus
transmission is probably going on south of the USA. ProMED-mail requests
information on West Nile virus surveillance from Mexico and Central and
South America. Any information from this area similar to that provided in
previous years would be greatly appreciated. - Mod.TY]
