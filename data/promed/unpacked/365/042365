On Friday in Brussels, Belgium's health ministry banned the sale of chicken
and eggs after stocks from some farms were found to contain high levels of
the cancer- causing chemical dioxin.
"As a precautionary measure the ministry requests that retailers remove
chickens and eggs from their shelves," it said in a statement, adding
further test results would be released next week. "The risk is small, but
there is a certain risk," Public Health Minister Marcel Colla said.
Only chicken meat and eggs were included in the ban and other poultry was
not affected, the ministry said.In a separate statement the agriculture
ministry said it was investigating high levels of dioxin in chicken meat
and eggs linked to a batch of animal feed contaminated with dioxin. Dioxin
is a highly toxic chemical which, once absorbed by the human body, is not
excreted and can cause cancer.
The contaminated feed had come from oils supplied by a company based near
Ghent, northwest Belgium, Nicole De Rouck of the public prosecutor's office
in Ghent told [news reporters].
A batch of contaminated oils had been supplied to 9 animal feed makers in
Belgium as well as 1 in France and 1 in the Netherlands, the ministry said.
De Rouck said the contamination might have originated further back in the
supply chain. European Commission officials said no decision on any
European action was likely until Monday at the earliest.
The agriculture ministry said it had begun its investigation in late March
after problems were reported at several farms. Time-consuming tests meant
the ministry had not received test results showing the contamination had
spread to chicken meat and eggs until May 26.
Results from tests on pork were still not known, but if high dioxin levels
were found in pork samples, the production units affected would be placed
under surveillance, it added.
They said the Belgian authorities held talks with the EU Friday regarding
poultry and egg exports from Belgium. The EU's standing committee on animal
nutrition is due to hold a regular meeting Monday and Tuesday and will
discuss the issue.
