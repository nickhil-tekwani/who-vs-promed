The 2012 West Nile virus (WNV) outbreak continues nationally, although it seems to be slowing, as federal health officials report 79 new cases and 5 deaths during the past week, according to a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) report 20 Nov 2012 [available at http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvbid/westnile/surv&controlCaseCount12_detailed.htm].

As of Tuesday [20 Nov 2012], a total of 5207 cases of West Nile virus disease in people, including 234 deaths, have been reported to CDC. This is up from 5128 cases and 229 deaths reported a week ago.

Health officials report that the 5207 cases this year [2012] is the most reported since 2003. Actually, it is a long way off from 2003's total of 9862 cases and 264 fatalities. In fact in that year, Colorado alone reported nearly 3000 cases.

Of the 5207 cases, 2643 (51 per cent) were classified as neuroinvasive disease (such as meningitis or encephalitis) and 2564 (49 per cent) were classified as non-neuroinvasive disease.

Texas has reported 1707 cases this year, 4 times the state with the second most cases, California with 424 cases.

Alaska and Hawaii are the only states not to report West Nile virus infections in people, birds, or mosquitoes this year.

[Since many WNV infections are asymptomatic or cause very mild febrile reactions, they go unreported. Thus, the total number of individuals with WNV infections this year (2012) is significantly higher than the 5207 cases reported above. The number of new cases should be decreasing as the vector populations are reduced by cool to cold autumn weather across much of the WNV range in North America.
