Black kites were reportedly dropping dead from the sky in the state's north claiming an unknown number of the medium-sized raptors. Biosecurity Queensland has run months of laboratory tests on several black kites, also known as firebirds, and ruled out exotic diseases like avian influenza and Newcastle disease.

Latest test results show they died as a result of trichomoniasis, an infection caused by a parasite, a disease common in pigeons. "The exact route of infection to the kites in this case is unknown," a Biosecurity Queensland spokesman said. "However, possible causes could include kites (a bird of prey) feeding on a diseased infected bird, and/or a parent kite feeding infected meat to their young."

Staff in north Queensland continue to monitor the region for bird mortalities.

In a separate case, a far north Queensland farmer will face court later this year [2013] charged with breaching the Nature Conservation Act over the alleged poisoning of 52 protected brolgas on a southern Tablelands property.

His company, Osprey Australia, which operates Mandalee station at Innot Hot Springs, was last week fined AUD 15 000 [USD 13 756] after a Cairns Magistrate ruled the birds died from eating corn laced with poison in 2011. Tests revealed the birds died from lethal doses of pesticide found in corn which had been placed in small piles throughout the 2300 hectare property.

[Common black kites (_Milvus migrans_) are diurnal raptors in the Accipitridae family. Widely distributed in the eastern hemisphere, they are opportunist hunters and have been known to take birds, bats, and rodents. They will also feed on household refuse and carrion.

_Trichomonas gallinae_ is a common protozoan parasite of pigeons (_Columbiformes_) which principally infects the upper alimentary tract, where it can cause necrotic ingluvitis [death of the tissues of the crop or craw in birds]. Epidemic mortality in columbiform species has been previously reported, and the parasite infrequently infects other avian taxa such as birds of prey and songbirds. Trichomoniasis has been postulated to be a factor contributing to the extinction of the passenger pigeon, _Ectopistes migratorius_, and has been shown to be a significant cause of nestling mortality in the island-endemic pink pigeon, _Nesoenas mayeri_, and in the Iberian Peninsula population of the Bonelli's eagle, _Hieraaetus fasciatus_. - Mod.PMB
