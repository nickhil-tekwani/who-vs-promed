Syphilis cases are increasing nationwide, and Spartanburg County [in the U.S. state of South Carolina] saw the 2nd highest number of infections in South Carolina in 2012, according to federal and state data.

In 2011, 6 cases were reported in Spartanburg County. In 2012, the number of cases here more than tripled, with 22 cases reported, according to the most recent data from the S.C. [South Carolina] Department of Health and Environmental Control [DHEC]. Only Richland County, with 75 reported syphilis cases, had more.

Statewide, 225 cases were reported [in 2012], ranking South Carolina 13th in the nation. That's up one spot from the previous year [2011], when 221 cases were reported.

In the U.S., 15 667 cases were reported in 2012, an 11.1 percent increase from 2011, according to an 8 Jan 2014 report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Janet Tapp, who leads the STD/HIV division at DHEC, said the agency has staff, known as disease intervention specialists, who help to notify partners of persons identified with syphilis and offer them screenings, any necessary treatment, and prevention counseling. DHEC also contracts with 4 community-based organizations, including one in the Upstate, to provide syphilis prevention services, including education, testing, and counseling.

"Syphilis prevention messages and methods need to be emphasized widely and increased among all sexually active populations," Tapp said.

Symptoms of syphilis include a firm, round, small, and painless sore on the genitals, anus, or mouth, or a rash on the body, especially on the palms of the hands or the soles of the feet, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The sexually transmitted disease can cause long-term complications and/or death if not adequately treated. The average time between infection and appearance of the 1st symptom is 21 days, but it can range from 10 to 90 days.

Syphilis that is passed from pregnant women to their babies is called congenital syphilis. While there weren't any of these cases reported in South Carolina in 2011, 6 were reported in 2012. Babies born with syphilis can have many health problems. It can lead to low birth weight, premature delivery or even a stillbirth, according to the CDC.

"Syphilis is easy to cure in its early stages," Tapp added. "When a person who is infected with syphilis gets tested and treated early in the infection, not only does he (or she) benefit from getting well, but also he or she prevents unknowingly giving the infection to sexual partners."

No home remedies or over-the-counter drugs will cure syphilis, but syphilis is simple to cure with appropriate antibiotics from a physician, according to the CDC. According to the CDC, correct and consistent use of latex condoms can reduce the risk of syphilis when the sore or site of potential exposure is covered. However, it is best to abstain from sex when any sore is present in the areas of the body used for sexual contact, the agency says.

Anyone who thinks that he or she might be infected with syphilis should seek advice about getting tested as soon as possible, Tapp said.

[In 2000, the number of cases and the incidence rate in the U.S. of primary and secondary (P&S) syphilis, the contagious stages of syphilis, were 5979 and 2.1 per 100 000, respectively, the lowest since reporting began in 1941 (Table 1, http://www.cdc.gov/std/stats11/tables/1.htm). Since that time, the number of cases and incidence rate of P&S syphilis increased almost yearly to 13 970 and 4.5 in 2011 (Table 1, http://www.cdc.gov/std/stats11/tables/1.htm). The southern region of the US accounted for 44.1 percent of P&S cases in 2011 (Table 26, http://www.cdc.gov/std/stats11/tables/26.htm). In recent years, young men who have sex with men (MSM) have accounted for an increasing number of P&S syphilis cases in the United States; in 2011, 72 percent of P&S syphilis cases were among MSM (http://www.cdc.gov/std/stats11/syphilis.htm).

Although the news report does not specify which stages of syphilis they are referring to, it is likely they are referring to P&S syphilis. South Carolina reported 91 cases of P&S syphilis in 2007, 98 case in 2008, 123 cases in 2009, 155 cases in 2010, and 221 cases in 2011; the incidence rate more than doubled from 2.1 in 2007 to 4.8 per 100 000 population in 2011, while the rates for the U.S. as a whole range from 3.8 to 4.6 for the years 2007-2011 (http://www.cdc.gov/std/stats11/tables/26.htm).

In 2012, South Carolina, with 225 cases, ranked 13 among 50 states reporting at least one case of P&S syphilis; the incidence rate was 4.8 cases per 100 000 population compared to the U.S. rate of 5.0 (http://www.cdc.gov/std/Syphilis2012/Syphilis-2012-All-Profiles.pdf). The rate among males (8.4 cases per 100 000 population) was 6x that in females (1.4) compared to the U.S. with a rate in males (9.3) that was 10.3x that in females (0.9). The rate in South Carolina among blacks was 7.9 times that of whites, and the rate among Hispanics was 1.2 times that of whites. Spartanburg County was among the 26 South Carolina counties with an incidence rate of P&S syphilis greater than 2.2 per 100 000 in 2012 (http://www.cdc.gov/std/Syphilis2012/Syphilis-2012-All-Profiles.pdf).

Spartanburg County, with a population of 284 307, is located in northwestern South Carolina (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spartanburg_County,_South_Carolina#Demographics). Its county seat and largest city is Spartanburg, with an urban population of 180 786 in 2010; the city of Spartanburg is 98 miles (158 km) northwest of Columbia, the state capital (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spartanburg,_South_Carolina).
