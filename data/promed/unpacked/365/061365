Croatia today [30 Dec 2016] announced the discovery of a highly contagious strain of bird flu in poultry at a small family farm on the country's northern border with Hungary.

The H5N8 strain of bird flu, detected at a farm in the village of Kriznica [Virovitičko-Podravska County) on the Drava river, killed all 15 chickens and ducks raised there, an agriculture ministry statement said.

The village is home to 22 small farms raising poultry, it said. But as it is located between the Drava and the border, there is no risk that the virus will spread, the ministry added.

Precautionary measures were nonetheless brought in. "A ban on the movement of people, animals, and vehicles was introduced in the area of infection," the statement said. All poultry in the village will be culled later on today [30 Dec 2016].

The H5N8 strain can spread quickly in affected farms, often leading to the culling of thousands of birds.

Since October [2016], the strain has been detected in 14 other European countries including Britain, France, and Germany.

Hungary has had the highest number of outbreaks in the past 3 months, with 201 cases reported in farms and 4 in wild birds.

Earlier (29 Dec 2016) Slovakia notified the OIE that HPAI H5 was confirmed in an outbreak in backyard birds in Bratislava, the country's capital. The outbreak began on 24 Dec 2016. The virus killed all but one of a flock of 65 laying hens, and the remaining bird was culled to slow the spread of the virus. While final results related to the neuraminidase (N) identity are pending, this case is likely to be H5N8, similar to the one in regional countries (Austria, Hungary, Poland, and Ukraine), which have all reported confirmed or suspected H5N8 outbreaks.

The Netherlands reported 11 additional H5N8 detections in wild birds from different parts of the country and 3 more outbreaks on farms. The wild bird detections were in 48 dead birds, most of them wigeons but also swans, a goose, and a white-tailed eagle. The farm outbreaks -- one in Gelderland province in the central part of the country and 2 in South Holland province -- affected breeding and egg-laying chickens. The virus killed 1148 of 81 676 susceptible birds and the remaining ones were destroyed.

Bulgaria reported one more H5 outbreak on 28 Dec 2016, a week after it reported its 1st such event. The outbreak struck a farm in Plovdiv province, killing 456 of the 4344 birds housed at the facility. Authorities culled the remaining poultry.

Finland reported on 28 Dec 2016 one more H5N8 detection in a wild bird, a white-tailed eagle found dead on the Aland Islands in the far southwestern part of the country, according to a report to the OIE.
