A man died from anthrax in Toytepi
----------------------------------
A 52 year old man died from anthrax in a small city, Toytepi, 25 km from
Tashkent on 3 Aug 2009. This man and several of his neighbors became
infected from the meat of a sick animal, the local residents say. The sick
animal belonged to the neighbor of the deceased, who knew about the disease
but slaughtered the animal and sold the meat across the street. People say
that more then 20 fell sick and more than 10 of them died. Some of the
infected are children, who swam in the water, which was contaminated by the
viscera of the sick cow. The hospital where this case was admitted
confirmed his death, but the deputy of the state sanitary-epidemiological
surveillance department said that the cause of his death was not anthrax.
The official report says that this was the first case and first fatality
from anthrax this year. There were 2 fatal cases during the last year and
no cases in 2007. The worst year was 1991, when about 60 people died from
anthrax.

Unfortunately this part of Uzbekistan, like much of western Uzbekistan,
suffers from enzootic anthrax in the local livestock, which overflows into
the human population. - Mod.MHJ
