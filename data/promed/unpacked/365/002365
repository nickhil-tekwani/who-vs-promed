---------------------------------------------------------------------
In April 2015, lesions typical of orange rust were observed in a commercial sugarcane field in Misiones province on a non-identified cultivar (a complex hybrid of _Saccharum_ spp). Symptoms on leaves differed from those of brown rust of sugarcane (_P. melanocephala_), commonly observed in the region.

Leaf samples were analyzed. Uredinia and urediniospore were similar morphologically to those described for the fungus _Puccinia kuehnii_, causal agent of sugarcane orange rust. Uredinial lesions were orange and variable in size, hypophyllous, ellipsoidal to fusiform in shape, and distinctly lighter than pustules of _P. melanocephala_ that were present along with _P. kuehnii_.

Identification of the pathogen was confirmed by molecular studies. The internal transcribed spacer 1, 5.8S ribosomal RNA, and internal transcribed spacer 2 of the rust were sequenced. The sequence was identical to sequences of _P. kuehnii_ and distinct from known sequences of _P. melanocephala_.

Orange rust, initially reported in the Asia-Pacific region, has caused important losses in Australia. In the Western Hemisphere it was first reported in Florida in 2007 [see ProMED-mail post 20070731.2457]. Since being reported in Brazil in 2009 [see ProMED-mail post 20100122.0247], annual surveys have been conducted in all sugarcane production regions of Argentina. At present, the only focus of orange rust infection detected is the one in Misiones province, located 1200 km from Tucuman, the main sugarcane growing region of the country. To our knowledge, this is the 1st report of _P. kuehnii_ in Argentina.

[2] Disease survey: Tucuman

It is recommended to monitor sugarcane crops for appearance of diseases. Major diseases currently observed in Tucuman include brown rust (caused by the fungus _Puccinia melanocephala_) which was most prevalent in varieties TUCCP LCP 85-384 and 77-42, as well as, to a lesser extent, "red streak" (_Acidovorax avenae_) and smut (_Sporisorium scitamineum_).

Environmental conditions are very conducive for brown rust and an alert was issued for the current crop. Of particular worry is the possibility of emergence of new strains able to overcome resistance of varieties. This was the case for LCP 85-384, the variety most commonly grown in Tucuman, which became very susceptible to brown rust in 2005 when the pathogen overcame its resistance.

It is being stressed that while in 2015 orange rust was reported in Misiones for the 1st time in the country, so far it is only found in that province. However, growers should be warned not to stop monitoring for the disease and, when in doubt, consult specialists. The current varietal distribution in Tucuman (83 per cent of the area is planted with LCP 85-384) poses a particularly high risk for the arrival of orange rust. Therefore, it is recommended to diversify the sugarcane area using new varieties currently made available to producers.

[Orange rust of sugarcane caused by the fungus _Puccinia kuehnii_ has the potential to cause significant economic losses to the crop. Symptoms include minute, elongated yellow lesions, which develop an orange to orange-brown colour as they expand. Most rust pustules occur on the lower leaf surface with more lesions toward the leaf base. Disease development is favoured by warm, humid summers and cool autumns, and by rain. The rust spores are rapidly spread by wind, as well as by mechanical means and with contaminated materials. Disease management includes fungicides and development of resistant cane varieties suitable to local requirements.

In Australia, _P. kuehnii_ had been present for 100 years, but in 2000, a much more virulent strain emerged devastating the then most widely grown sugarcane cultivar. When the disease was reported for the 1st time in the western hemisphere in 2007 from Florida, USA (ProMED-mail post 20070731.2457), it was not clear whether this was a similar scenario with emergence of a new strain of a previously unrecognised endemic pathogen, or whether the pathogen was actually introduced to the US at that time.

Orange rust has been reported since then from additional countries in the Americas (see previous ProMED-mail posts listed below). Characterisation and comparison of fungal isolates from the different areas would be needed to clarify whether these reports represent the spread of the same fungal strain from Florida; are due to separate incursions from the same or different sources; or represent separate mutation events detected as a result of increased vigilance in the region.

For brown rust caused by the related _P. melanocephala_, colour and distribution of leaf lesions vary from orange rust, and development of this pathogen is inhibited by rain.

Sugarcane smut is caused by the fungus _Sporisorium scitamineum_. It is highly contagious and can be spread by wind or carried on clothing and machinery. Symptoms are a black whip-like structure emerging from the central core of meristematic tissues. The whip contains spores covered with a thin membrane, which ruptures easily to release the spores. Smut spores survive for long periods in soil or plant debris. Disease management may include removal of inoculum, burning of infected cane fields, fungicides and use of clean planting material. However, smut control is best achieved by using resistant cane cultivars available for different regions.

The bacterial pathogen _Acidovorax (previously _Pseudomonas_) avenae_ subsp. _avenae_ (Aaa) can affect a number of mainly grassy hosts, including crops such as maize, millets, sorghum, oats, sugarcane, and rice, while pathogenicity on wheat varies with strains. The bacteria can be spread by water, mechanical means (including animal and human activities), and infected plant materials (including crop debris). Seed transmission is suspected in some hosts. Disease management may include crop rotation and phytosanitation to prevent spread (for example, disinfection of farming tools). Chemical control (copper compounds) may be effective but is hardly feasible for large areas.
