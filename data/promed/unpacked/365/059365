Indonesia: 39-year-old Is Suspected Avian Influenza Case
-----------------------------------------------
A 39-year-old Indonesian man has died from the H5N1 strain of bird flu,
according to local tests, Health Minister Siti Fadillah Supari said on Fri
16 Dec 2005. Supari told reporters the Ministry was awaiting confirmation
of the results from a Hong Kong laboratory affiliated with the World Health
Organization (WHO). Indonesia has had 9 deaths from bird flu confirmed by
the Hong Kong laboratory and 5 cases in which patients have survived.
"Local tests show he's positive for avian influenza virus infection,"
Supari said, referring to the man who died earlier this week at a hospital
in Jakarta designated to treat bird flu patients. WHO spokeswoman Maria
Cheng said the victim was from south Jakarta and that the initial
indications were that it was another isolated case. "There were reports of
sick and dying poultry in the neighborhood, so it does look as if there is
an identifiable source of exposure," said Cheng, who is based at WHO
headquarters in Geneva.
Since late 2003, the H5N1 avian flu virus is known to have killed 71 people
in 5 Asian countries -- Indonesia, Thailand, Viet Nam, China and Cambodia.
The highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus, at the moment, is hard
for humans to catch and remains essentially a virus in birds. However,
scientists fear it could mutate into a form that could easily pass from
human to human. The virus is endemic in poultry in parts of Asia and has
affected birds in 2/3rds of the provinces in Indonesia, a sprawling
archipelago of some 17 000 islands and 220 million people. Indonesia has
millions of chickens and ducks, many in the backyards of rural or urban homes.

Indonesia: 8-year-old Boy Is Suspected Avian Influenza Case
-----------------------------------------------
An 8-year-old Indonesian boy has died from the H5N1 strain of avian
influenza virus, according to local tests, a Health Ministry official said
on Monday [19 Dec 2005]. Hariadi Wibisono, Head of a Department charged
with eradicating animal-borne diseases, said that the local test results
had yet to be confirmed by a Hong Kong laboratory affiliated with the World
Health Organization.
Indonesia has had 9 deaths from bird flu confirmed by the Hong Kong
laboratory and 5 cases in which patients have survived. Besides the boy,
Indonesia is also awaiting confirmation from Hong Kong of local tests which
showed a 39-year-old man died of bird flu last week [see part (1) above].
It was unclear whether the boy, who died in Jakarta last week [3rd week
December 2005], had contact with infected chickens, Wibisono said.
Since late 2003, the H5N1 virus is known to have killed 71 people in 5
Asian countries -- Indonesia, Thailand, Viet Nam, China and Cambodia -- and
almost all are believed to have caught it from infected fowl. The highly
pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus is hard for humans to catch and
remains essentially a virus in birds. However, scientists fear it could
mutate into a form that could pass easily from human to human. The United
Nations urged Jakarta to take steps to halt the spread of the disease. "We
are losing the battle against this particular avian influenza outbreak.
It is a very nasty bird flu virus," David Nabarro, the U.N. coordinator for
avian influenza, told Indonesian officials at a meeting in Jakarta. "Act as
though a pandemic influenza will start tomorrow. Don't think we can wait
around and not worry it won't start for 6 months or one year," Nabarro
said. "Once it starts, it is too late to prepare." Children would be the
most vulnerable group, he said. Jakarta has designated dozens of hospitals
across the country for treating patients with bird flu symptoms and set out
plans to produce the anti-viral drug Tamiflu and vaccinate poultry in a bid
to stop the spread of the disease.
A bird flu committee with powers to bypass the bureaucracy would be up and
running soon, Welfare Minister Aburizal Bakrie said in the same Jakarta
meeting. "Political, financial, logistical, security and bureaucratic
constraints are among the biggest threats to an effective response to a
pandemic threat. I invite the best brains and expertise to join this
committee," he said. The virus is endemic in poultry in parts of Asia and
has affected birds in 2/3rds of the provinces in Indonesia, a sprawling
archipelago of 17 000 islands and 220 million people. Indonesia has
millions of chickens and ducks, many in the backyards of rural or urban
homes. Since August 2003, 10 million poultry have died from the H5N1 strain
or have been culled.

[If confirmed by the WHO affiliated laboratory in Hong Kong, these 2
suspected human cases of avian influenza will increase the number of human
cases of H5N1 avian influenza in Indonesia from 14 to 16 and the number of
deaths from 9 to 11.
It is possible that the 39-year-old suspected case described above may be
the 36-year-old suspected avian influenza virus fatality in south Jakarta
reported previously in "Avian influenza, human - East Asia (200)
20051216.3618," also awaiting confirmation. Clarification is awaited - Mod.CP]
