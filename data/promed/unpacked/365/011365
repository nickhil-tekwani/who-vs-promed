Information received on [and dated] 22 Nov 2019 from Dr Nikolay Vlasov, deputy head, Federal Service for Veterinary and Phytosanitary Surveillance, Ministry of Agriculture, Moscow, Russia

Summary
Report type: immediate notification
Date of start of the event: 15 Nov 2019
Date of confirmation of the event: 20 Nov 2019
Reason for notification: new strain of a listed disease in the country
Causal agent: Newcastle disease virus [NDV] genotype VII
Nature of diagnosis: clinical, laboratory (basic and advanced), necropsy
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country.

New outbreaks (1)
Outbreak location: Kislino, Kursky, Kurskaya oblast [Kursk]
Date of start of the outbreak: 15 Nov 2019
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: village
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Birds / 318 / 279 / 279 / - / -

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]:
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Birds / 88 / 88 / 100 / **
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter
** Not calculated because of missing information

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comments: the isolates belong to genotype VII, as opposed to the isolates recovered for last occurrence in 2013, which belong to genotype VI.

Control measures: movement control inside the country; surveillance within containment and/or protection zone; quarantine; official disposal of carcasses, by-products, and waste; control of wildlife reservoirs; zoning; disinfection; vaccination permitted (if a vaccine exists); no treatment of affected animals

Measures to be applied: stamping out

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Kurskaya Veterinary Laboratory (local laboratory) / birds / polymerase chain reaction (PCR) / 15 Nov 2019 / positive
All-Russian Research Institute for Animal Health (OIE reference laboratory) / birds / polymerase chain reaction (PCR) / 20 Nov 2019 / positive
All-Russian Research Institute for Animal Health (OIE reference laboratory) / birds / virus sequencing / 20 Nov 2019 / positive

Future reporting

"NDV strains are classified into 3 different pathotypes: highly virulent (velogenic), intermediate (mesogenic), or avirulent (lentogenic). All NDV strains belong to one serotype, but there is antigenic and genetic diversity among strains. NDV strains have been classified into 2 major classes on the basis of genome length and the sequence of the F gene. The class I strains are mostly avirulent and isolated from wild birds. Class II strains contain both virulent and avirulent viruses that have been recovered from wild and domestic birds and are further divided into 18 genotypes. In general, the most prevalently circulating genotypes are V, VI, and VII of class II NDV strains."

Based on the scientific literature, genotypes VII NDV strains have been reported since 1990 in numerous geographical regions including Europe, Asia, the Middle East, and Africa.

"NDV is a human pathogen, and the most common sign of infection in humans is conjunctivitis that develops within 24 hours of NDV exposure to the eye. Reported infections have been non-life threatening and usually not debilitating for more than a day or 2. The most frequently reported and best substantiated clinical signs in human infections have been eye infections, usually consisting of unilateral or bilateral reddening, excessive lachrymation, oedema of the eyelids, conjunctivitis, and sub-conjunctival haemorrhage. Although the effect on the eye may be quite severe, infections are usually transient, and the cornea is not affected. There is no evidence of human-to-human spread. There is one report of the isolation of a pigeonlike APMV-1 from lung tissue, urine, and faeces of an immunocompromised patient who died of pneumonia."
