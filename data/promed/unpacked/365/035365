[Thiruvananthapuram, located on the west Malabar Coast near the tip of the mainland Indian subcontinent, is the capital city of the Indian state of Kerala (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiruvananthapuram). Thiruvananthapuram is subject to the south-west monsoons, getting its 1st showers in early June, and is also subject to the receding north-east monsoons, which hit the city in October. Flooding in its a low lying urban center is reported to occur routinely when it rains (http://tinyurl.com/pujnzjr). Working standing in water, living near streams, and cleaning animals and their sheds have been found to be significant risk factors for leptospirosis in a case-control study of laboratory-confirmed leptospirosis in Thiruvananthapuram (http://healthsciences.ac.in/jan-mar-13/risk-factors-Leptospirosis.html).

Scrub typhus is said to be the 3rd most common infectious disease in Thiruvananthapuram after dengue and leptospirosis (http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/alert-against-scrub-typhus-in-kerala/article5340500.ece). The disease is caused by the rickettsia-like bacterium _Orientia tsutsugamushi_ that is transmitted by the bite of a chigger mite present in shrubberies. The disease is said to be transmitted mostly during the rainy season (http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/971797-overview#a6) and is highly endemic in suburban regions of Thiruvananthapuram (http://healthsciences.ac.in/CaseReport.html).

The large number of cases of leptospirosis and scrub typhus in Thiruvananthapuram could be due to an actual occurrence or better reporting in this city than in the rest of the state of Kerala.
