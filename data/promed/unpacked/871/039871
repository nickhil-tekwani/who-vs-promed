Doctors will call today for an urgent investigation into a newly-discovered
virus that may infect up to one in 10 of the [British] population. The
virus, known as TTV, was discovered in Japan a year ago. But British
studies to be published today will reveal for the first time that the
infection is probably worldwide. One study found TTV in two per cent of
blood donors in Scotland. The other found it in one in 10 healthy people in
England. Researchers have been exploring a link with hepatitis and chronic
liver disease.
"The widespread distribution of TTV in blood donations and blood products
demonstrates the need for urgent investigation of the clinical impact of
TTV infection," said one group of researchers, led by Dr. Peter Simmonds of
Edinburgh University.
Meanwhile, an Australian infectious diseases expert [Y. Cossart; The
Lancet, 352: 164, 1998] said that the studies had "disturbing implications"
because they implied that there may well be other newly-emerged and as yet
unknown human viruses lurking in the population. Dr. Simmonds and his
colleagues found that two per cent of blood donors carried the virus, while
half of the blood products were contaminated with it. One in five sufferers
of severe hepatitis were infected. Some haemophiliac patients still carried
the virus, although it was a decade since they received the
non-heat-treated products that could have contained the virus. But the
second study at the Institute of Hepatology in London concluded that TTV
probably does not cause chronic liver disease and does not seem to be
connected to any other illness.

[The comment by Cossart and two articles on TTV appeared in the 18 July
issue of The Lancet. One of the articles, by Simmonds et al., is entitled
"Detection of a novel DNA virus (TTV) in blood donors and blood products".
The other is by Naoumov et al. and is entitled "Presence of a newly
described human DNA virus (TTV) in patients with liver disease". Each
paper indicates that the association of TTV with liver disease is not
proven.
Brian Mahy, Director, Division of Viral and Rickettsial Diseases, CDC,
Atlanta, tells me that "TTV is named from the initials (TT) of a patient
who developed non-A,B,C,D,E,or G transfusion-related hepatitis but that TTV
also stands for transfusion-transmitted virus. The first report was by
Nishizawa et al, Biochem.Biophys.Res.Comm. They used representational
difference analysis of DNA to isolate a clone from serum comparing before
and after transfusion. The sequence is of single-stranded DNA less than
4,000 nucleotides in length, perhaps parvovirus-like..." [which are larger,
usually around 5,000].
Brian kindly provided two earlier references:
Nishizawa, T et al BBRC 241, 92-97, 1997 "A novel DNA virus (TTV)
associated with elevated transaminase levels in posttransfusion hepatitis
of unknown etiology"
Okamoto, H et al Hepatology Research 10, 1-16 1998 "Molecular cloning and
characterization of a novel DNA virus(TTV) associated with posttransfusion
hepatitis of unknown etiology"
Thus far no one has shown that this DNA is infectious, so its status as a
virus is unclear. CDC is actively engaged in research on this potentially
important virus, if indeed it is a virus. - Mod.CHC]
