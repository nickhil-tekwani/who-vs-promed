A Kampong Cham province man suspected to have avian influenza will become the year's [2013] 8th verified case if ongoing tests at the Institut Pasteur's laboratory confirm him positive, health officials said yesterday [Sun 17 Feb 2013].

The man was admitted to the Kampong Cham provincial hospital with respiratory problems after eating 2 ducks that had died in his village, where several poultry recently had died, said Ly Sovann, deputy director of the Communicable Disease Control Department.

Seang Nath, Director of the Health Centre in Mesor Chrey, the patient's home commune, said he quickly had sent the patient to the provincial referral hospital after learning that he had developed symptoms consistent with H5N1 [influenza virus infection] on 6 Feb 2013. Despite government education efforts, "some villagers are still eating poultry that are sick or have died," he said.

[If confirmed, this case will become the 8th human case of avian A/(H5N1) influenza virus infection in Cambodia so far this year (2013). The suspected case's exposure appears to have been contact with and consumption of sick poultry. It is not stated whether the sick birds were suffering from A/(H5N1) virus infection. Further information is awaited.
