The Israeli army is testing an anthrax vaccine on its troops, Israel radio
reported Sunday. Israel fears that countries such as Iraq might attack with
anthrax-laced missiles. The army was [sic testing the vaccine on an
undisclosed number of soldiers, and assessing possible use on citizens if
Israel faced an emergency situation in
the event of a biological war, the report said.
Anthrax has never been used in combat, but there are fears that renegade
nations or terrorist groups may use it as a weapon. The U.S. military is in
the process of vaccinating all of its active-duty and reserve forces against
the biological agent.
