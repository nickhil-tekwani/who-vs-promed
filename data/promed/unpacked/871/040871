Canada (BC): Norovirus Infection of Oysters Suspected Cause of Gastroenteritis
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The British Columbia Centre for Disease Control (BCCD) has confirmed that
oysters are behind a rash of illnesses reported over the past couple of
months. The BCCDC issued an advisory last month warning people to cook all
oysters before eating them. But until now, tests had not conclusively
linked the illnesses to oysters.
BCCDC epidemiologist Laura McDougall says the problem is the common
norovirus that is passed among humans. But McDougall says it's not possible
to confirm the presence of the virus in the oysters themselves. "We do have
test limitations on being able to do that," she says. "We have been able to
detect the virus in clinical samples - samples from human that became ill."
McDougall says the number of cases of norovirus illness being reported has
dropped off dramatically in the last few weeks.

USA (Nevada): Total of Norovirus Cases in Las Vegas Reaches 284
---------------------------------------------------------------
Nevada health officials recorded 49 cases of a [viral gastroenteritis] in
Las Vegas during the first 8 days of this month despite ramped-up cleaning
efforts at the California Hotel and Casino.
Dave Tonelli, spokesman for the Clark County Health District, yesterday
said of the 284 cases reported between 3 Dec 2003 and Mon 8 Mar 2004, 37
people were sick in Dec 2003, 80 in January, 118 in February and 49 this
month. Tonelli said health officials are continuing to search for the
source of the norovirus infection, which generally causes nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea and fever. The focus has been on the California Hotel because most
of the people who got sick stayed, ate or gambled there. Boyd Gaming Corp.
spokesman Rob Stillwell yesterday said the hotel's stepped-up cleaning
measures went into effect 2 weeks ago. He believes the case numbers are
increasing as more people hear about the outbreak through news stories and
call health officials to report their illness.
Tonelli said the main health risk is dehydration. "For the typical person
in good health, this is a condition that's going to last maybe a day or
two." However, several people told The Advertiser that their elderly
relatives were hospitalized after [contracting viral gastroenteritis] in
Las Vegas.
Omni Air, the charter airline that flies California Hotel guests from
Hawaii on package tours, [has also been criticized by several passangers].
The Tulsa, Oklahoma-based company has been flying the Honolulu charter
since early last year. "We're doing special cleaning of the aircraft that
goes far beyond normal aircraft cleaning procedures," Pollard said. Omni
Air International managing director Chuck Pollard yesterday said the plane
that ferries visitors from Honolulu to Las Vegas six times a week is
cleaned under the same standards as any major airline. Since the illnesses
were reported, that cleaning schedule has intensified greatly, he said,
using cleaners with hospital-grade disinfectant. That also means throwing
out the blankets and pillows used after each flight, he said. "We put in
fresh pillows and blankets," he said.

UK: Wards in Glasgow Hospitals Closed by Norovirus Infection
---------------------------------------------------------------
GLASGOW: Eight wards at a Glasgow hospital and an elderly care unit have
been shut to new admissions following a further outbreak of [norovirus
infection]. The virus has now spread to 6 wards at the Victoria Infirmary
and 2 wards at its Mansionhouse Unit, a facility caring for pensioners. A
ward at the Western Infirmary has also been closed by [norovirus infection].
Five wards at the Victoria in the south side were closed at the weekend
because of the outbreak and 15 patients were showing symptoms. Now 28
patients are thought to have the virus. None are giving cause for concern.
Around 220 pensioners are cared for at the Mansionhouse Unit. The wards
closed have 3 or more patients who have suffered diarrhoea and vomiting. A
spokesman for NHS Greater Glasgow said: "The normal extra infection control
precautions have been put in place. "The wards have been closed as a
precautionary measure."
Winter vomiting disease is caused by a highly infectious virus and has been
responsible for closing scores of hospital wards and nursing homes. It
spreads quickly through the air and usually causes about 48 hours of
sickness, fever and diarrhoea. Incidents of [norovirus infection] trebled
in 2002 and experts fear new and more virulent strains have now appeared.
It was also confirmed the North Glasgow Trust has taken the precautionary
step of closing a ward to new admissions at the Western following a small
outbreak of [norovirus infection]. Six patients and one member of staff are
showing symptoms. The 21 bedded ward currently has 20 patients. A trust
spokesman said: "Our infection control team is working closely with the
ward and the situation is being constantly monitored."
The ward closures come a few months after 8 wards had to be shut in another
area of the Victoria Infirmary. A ward at a second hospital, the Southern
General, was also closed. The Victoria Infirmary was also hit in Aug 2003,
and Oct 2002. And - in one of the worst outbreaks of its kind - in Jan
2002, the hospital had to shut 12 wards, 8 of them in the Mansionhouse
Unit, after more than 100 people contracted infection.

Russia (Sverdlovsk Region: Outbreak of Rotavirus Enteritis Infection in Irbit
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the city of Irbit (Sverdlovsk region) 154 people were hospitalized as a
result of an outbreak of intestinal infection, according to a statement by
Sanitary epidemiological center physician Alexandr Rostyuk. "At the present
time, 154 people are hospitalized, of them 113 are children under 2 years
old. Most of the victims are suffering with rotavirus enteritis".
According to his statement, the rise in intestinal infections has occurred
since 9 Feb 2004. Condition of those hospitalized is characterized as
moderate, said the chief physician of the hospital.
Drinking water cleaning and chlorination measures were launched in the
city, physicians are recommending not to use raw drinking water, but to use
boiled water only and obey basic sanitary hygiene rules. At the present
time. Twelve kindergarten in the city are under quarantine, added Rostyuk.
He indicated that the outbreak of intestinal infection was due to
contamination of the public drinking water supply by contamination of the
system by spring flood water.

Viral Gastroenteritis Epidemic of 2002 Associated with New Norovirus Variant
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Public health workers from around Europe will recall 2002/2003 as the
'winter of norovirus outbreaks'. Noroviruses are the most common cause of
gastroenteritis in the community and are often associated with outbreaks in
semi-closed environments such as nursing homes, hospitals, cruise ships and
hotels. Reports in medical channels including Promed-mail
(<http://www.promedmail.org>), Eurosurveillance Weekly (1), and the popular
press brought an apparent epidemic of this common viral cause of
gastroenteritis to public attention. As was recently reported in The
Lancet, the European Foodborne Viruses Network
(<http://www.eufoodborneviruses.net>/), a research and surveillance group
funded by the European Commission Directorate-General for Research, has
been able to systematically confirm the Europe-wide increase of viral
gastroenteritis outbreaks and show that the increase in outbreaks in this
period was associated with the emergence of a new norovirus variant (a
genogroup II4 virus) (2).
Three of the participants in the network, the Netherlands, Germany and
England and Wales, had sustained epidemiological and viral characterisation
surveillance from 1995 to 2002. All three of these regions noted an
aberrant summertime peak and an unprecedented wintertime epidemic which
followed the detection of a new norovirus variant with a consistent
mutation in the polymerase gene. Eight out of nine countries with historic
trend data observed a substantial increase in norovirus outbreaks in 2002
over the previous peak from 1995 to 2001. Following initial detection of
the new variant in January 2002 in the Netherlands and Germany, the virus
spread and was the predominant cause of outbreaks throughout Europe. In the
six countries that collected data on the setting of these outbreaks, 60 to
85 percent occurred in healthcare settings (hospitals, nursing homes and
residential homes).
These findings highlight the dynamic nature of norovirus epidemiology. Even
within the predominant genogroup II4, new strains are capable of emerging
and causing major public health impact. These observations raise more
questions than they answer. For example, what characteristic of the 'new
variant' drove the epidemic? Is the virus more stable in the environment?
Did its antigenicity change such that it escaped existing immunity in the
population? And, how do these viruses spread so rapidly? It is often said
that international borders do not deter infectious diseases. The
dissemination of this epidemic also demonstrates just how rapidly
noroviruses can spread. This is not the first time that an international
epidemic has been associated with a common strain (3) and therefore
surveillance which combines basic public health data with virological
characterisation is essential to furthering understanding noroviruses, and
ultimately, for controlling them.

USA: Norovirus Outbreak Affects Sled Dog Race in Alaska
--------------------------------------------------------
State health officials mingled with mushers, race officials and visitors on
the trail of the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race trying to nip in the bud an
outbreak of highly contagious norovirus infection. Dr. Joe McLaughlin, an
epidemiologist with the state Department of Health, said a dozen cases have
been traced to McGrath, but the illness has traveled to Anchorage and the
village of Ruby. He flew to several race checkpoints on Fri 12 Mar 2004 to
track down fresh cases and to try to stop it from spreading further --
particularly striving to prevent it from affecting mushers.
"Severe bouts can lead to dehydration," he said. "That's why it's such a
concern among the athletes" who already may be dehydrated from their race.
Formerly known as Norwalk virus, norovirus causes vomiting, nausea and
diarrhea. Outbreaks often occur where large numbers of people mingle, such
as on cruise ships and tour buses, and is passed by eating or drinking food
or water contaminated by an infected person. The bouts typically last a day
or two, McLaughlin said, and there is no treatment. Most people recover
within two or three days.
The race outbreak seems to have started in McGrath in late February,
McLaughlin said. Several Iditarod staff members and volunteers from
Anchorage visited McGrath to help coordinate the race and returned showing
symptoms of the virus. Eventually, 11 people were diagnosed, he said. When
a physician's assistant in McGrath reported on The 11 Mar 2004 that
additional cases were showing up, McLaughlin said, concern quickly
elevated. The doctor, representing the Section of Epidemiology, and staff
of the Department of Environmental Conservation flew to McGrath to
investigate, and the federal Centers for Disease Control assigned a person
to the Alaska outbreak.
McLaughlin walked among the crowd gathered outside the Ruby checkpoint,
asking if anyone had the symptoms. No mushers have been affected, he said,
but two volunteer veterinarians in Ruby contracted it. Race officials are
now helping monitor mushers and the army of volunteers who help put on the
race every year, McLaughlin said. "We're in active surveillance," he said.
His advice to people along the trail was to wash their hands thoroughly and
often.
