Belgium has changed its slaughter system after an administrative error
resulted in the carcass of an animal with BSE being turned into animal feed
and exported. Farm Minister Karel Pinxten told a news conference that in
future all cows suspected of suffering from a nervous disease such as
rabies or Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy would automatically be
slaughtered and incinerated. In the past cows suffering from rabies have
been slaughtered and turned into animal feed.
The cow in question had been slaughtered on suspicion of having rabies.
Although the rabies test proved negative and tests for BSE began, the
carcass was processed into animal feed which was sold in Belgium, Poland
and the Netherlands. It was not until more than a month after the
slaughtering and processing that tests on its brain finally proved it had
been suffering from BSE.
Minister Pinxten said all the tainted feed sold in Belgium had been traced
and it had been established that all of it went for animals such as pigs
and chickens in which feed is permitted to include animal protein. The
Netherlands and Poland also ban the inclusion of animal protein in ruminant
feed. He said the authorities in both countries had been given all the
details necessary to trace the contaminated feed.
Pinxten said that rigorous tracing of the origins of the infected cow had
proved beyond reasonable doubt that it had not caught the infection from
its mother or from contaminated feed or drugs. In the absence of any other
evidence, it therefore had to be concluded that this case of BSE had been
one of spontaneous infection from an unknown cause, he concluded.
