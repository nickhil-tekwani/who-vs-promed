The interdepartmental anti-epizootics commission has held a meeting under the chairmanship of Alexander Lukyanov, vice-governor of the Altai Territory.

Deputy head of the Regional Office of Rosselkhoznadzor [Federal Service for Veterinary and Phytosanitary Surveillance] for the Altai Territory and the Altai Republic, Viktor Nekrasov, told "Altayskaya Pravda" about the problem under discussion. The meeting addressed the epizootic situation in the Russian Federation and the Republic of Kazakhstan, especially in reference to highly infectious animal diseases. The situation remains serious, notably regarding anthrax, foot and mouth disease [FMD], nodular dermatitis [lumpy skin disease, LSD], African swine fever [ASF], and others.

ASF does not affect humans, but its consequences are terrible in socioeconomic terms, affecting mainly private households. In our province, 74 per cent of the swine population is kept in private farms. The only available method to prevent the spread of ASF at present is the bloodless slaughter, followed by burning of the sick animals. Pigs are a significant source of income for farmers; we must do everything possible to prevent infection of animals with the virus.

In order to save the owners of private farms from illusions and to enhance their compliance with mandatory requirements, here are the facts: since the beginning of 2016, 167 ASF outbreaks have been recorded on the territory of the Russian Federation (compared with 84 throughout 2015), of which 119 outbreaks involved domestic pigs and 48 wild boars. The disease has been registered on the territory of 17 administrative regions of the Federation.

ASF is a viral disease of domestic and wild pigs of all breeds and ages, characterized by a 100 per cent mortality of diseased animals; no vaccine is available.

[The report includes description of the virus spread by illegal movement of animals, the uncontrolled handling of animal waste and carcasses, and indirectly by people between infected and other farms; the role of wild boars is described as well, underlining their numbers -- 3000 -- in unaffected, named rural settlements].

The interdepartmental emergency anti-epizootic committee recommended that the heads of municipalities of the region would address, in due early meetings of local committees, the vaccination coverage of animals against FMD (in areas bordering the Republic of Kazakhstan) and anthrax. Special attention deserves to be paid to the mentioned ASF preventive measures and to immediate reporting of suspected cases.

Departments and agencies are urged to continue and intensify efforts to identify and respond to cases of unauthorized movement of livestock and their products, including those coming from the Republic of Kazakhstan. It was decided to apply to the federal authorities with a proposal to increase the penalties for violation of veterinary legislation.

It would be desirable that in the districts of the region, public information and explanatory activities will be intensified. Immediate notification of any suspected disease in animals is essential.

[Both Altai territory and Altai Republic, referred to in the above report, border Kazakhstan. The Altai Republic borders Mongolia as well; see map at http://www.worldatlas.com/img/world-state/altai-krai-administrative-territory-russia.jpg.

The emergency meeting described addressed concerns of highly infectious animal diseases spreading into the 2 represented territories, from 2 directions: ASF from the Russian Federation, and other mentioned diseases (LSD, FMD "and others"), from other (namely, southern) regions. Subscribers are specifically referred to the comment by the regional representative of Rosselkhoznadzor (Russia's Federal Service for Veterinary and Phytosanitary Surveillance) who referred to the need for FMD vaccination coverage "in areas bordering the Republic of Kazakhstan".

Kazakhstan's most recent reported outbreak of FMD was submitted to the OIE on 14 May 2013, declared resolved 18 Jul 2013. In July 2016, ProMED-mail posted a 'request for information' addressing media reports on suspected FMD outbreaks in West Kazakhstan (20160717.4350687). Later it was published that vaccination was applied during the said event (20160722.4362368). Later, LSD was officially reported from western Kazakhstan. The absence of FMD in West Kazakhstan deserves to be confirmed.

Since August 2014, Kazakhstanenjoys the status of an OIE member country "having an FMD free zone where vaccination is not practised, according to the provisions of Chapter 8.8. of the Terrestrial Code, Edition 2015." This non-vaccinating zone consists of the regions of Akmola, Aktobe, Atyrau, West Kazakhstan, Karaganda, Kostanay, Mangystau, Pavlodar, and North Kazakhstan, as designated by the Delegate of Kazakhstan in a document addressed to the director general in August 2014.

On 26 Aug 2016, a consultation "in the form of a conference call initiated by the Kazakh side", was held with Rosselkhoznadzor (see their press release at http://www.fsvps.ru/fsvps/news/18195.html in Russian). "The sides discussed in detail a wide range of issues related to mutual interests concerning safe and effective trade between Russia and Kazakhstan. In particular, a decision was made to ensure closer cooperation between territorial administrations and laboratories subordinated to the Rosselkhoznadzor and the Ministry of Agriculture of Kazakhstan and also to ensure integration of the Russian and Kazakh electronic systems used for veterinary surveillance"....

"During the consultations the sides especially focused on the epizootic situation in Russia and Kazakhstan. The sides also discussed the option to partially lift restrictions imposed on food supplies due to lumpy skin disease and pasteurellosis reported in Kazakhstan and also due to anthrax and lumpy skin disease in Russia. It was noted that the use of such an important tool as regionalization in the territory of the EEC member countries could be a very promising area of work that ensures freedom from contagious animal diseases and facilitates regulation of transportation.

"In conclusion, the sides discussed an idea to develop an agreement on cooperation between the competent authorities of the 2 countries regulating both veterinary and phytosanitary surveillance. The Kazakh side intends to submit its proposals to the Rosselkhoznadzor for the document content in the near future."

Kazakhstan submitted a report on a massive outbreak of LSD in its north western region on 22 Jul 2016 (3557 susceptible cattle, 459 cases, 34 deaths); the start of the event was given as 7 Jul 2016. Media reports suggested an earlier start (20160723.4365082) and additional location (20160727.4374008). No culling or slaughter of the officially reported, affected cattle was notified. 3 follow-up OIE reports (on 25 Jul, 5 Aug, and 26 Aug 2016) have indicated "no new cases".

The regional situation related to FMD and LSD deserves to be updated; another disease which has been spreading in Asia, namely PPR (peste des petits ruminants), deserves attention and surveillance as well. - Mod.AS
