The 1st case of Zika -- the new disease transmitted by _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes -- was recorded the weekend of [30-31 May 2015] in the state of Rio de Janeiro.

According to the State Health Undersecretary Alexander Chieppe, the [dengue-]like symptoms hinder the proper diagnosis. "This is a concern for us not to neglect those dengue cases that occur with greater lethality. It is important [for] clarity in diagnosis and, if in doubt, treat it as dengue," the Undersecretary said.

The case identified over the weekend was diagnosed through laboratory examination. "The confirmation came on Sunday (31) [May 2015] at night, confirming the 1st Zika transmission here in the state of Rio de Janeiro. There was no history of travel and it evolved well clinically, "said Chieppe.

According to the [Under-]Secretary, despite the lethality not being like that of dengue, it is important to go to a health service to seek appropriate treatment. "Treatment is supportive based on the signs and symptoms, and as it does not have the lethality of dengue, vigorous rehydration as used for dengue is not necessary" said Chieppe.

[In fact, in the light of current knowledge, lethality associated with Zika is not considered high. However, in a result quite similar to clinical dengue and limitations -- including possible cross-reaction in tests for detection of antibodies against dengue -- for research/ laboratory diagnosis, clinical management should be in line with the recommendations for suspected cases of dengue. - Mod.RNA

Cases had been reported earlier from states in Brazil`s northeast -- see ProMED archive for 1 May 2015 below.
