The number of confirmed leptospirosis cases in Ernakulam district has gone up in October [2021] compared to figures in September [2021]. A total of 18 cases were confirmed in September [2021], while the number of suspected cases was 51. The number of confirmed cases was 29 as on [26 Oct 2021]. Another 48 suspected cases were also reported in the district from [1 to 26 Oct 2021], according to official estimates. The number of deaths due to suspected leptospirosis went up from 5 in September [2021] to 6 this month [October]. Ernakulam has witnessed 304 suspected cases since January this year [2021]. The number of confirmed cases is 133.

District Medical Officer N.K. Kuttappan said the cases would go up once the rains were over. People in rain-affected areas and those engaged in relief and cleaning work should take doxycycline tablets on the advice of health workers, he added. Dr. Kuttappan said those who died of leptospirosis were found to have not taken preventive medicines. They had also delayed receiving proper medical care.

The health authorities said people should refrain from self-medication, if they have leptospirosis symptoms. They include fever, redness in eyes, headache, skin rash, and muscle pain. Any delay in taking treatment leads to liver and kidney problems. Multi-organ failure is reported in severe cases.

Those rearing cattle and involved in agriculture as well as cleaning workers need to be careful, as chances of getting infected through urine and droppings of animals in stagnant water are high. "They should take doxycycline tablets distributed by the government," Dr. Kuttappan said.

Workers in such scenarios should wear boots covering feet to prevent getting exposed to infection. They should also wear gloves as a precautionary measure. Those with wounds in hands or feet should stay away from work and return only after they are cured, the health authorities said.

The Health Department pointed out that conditions like fever and throat pain need not be viewed as symptoms of COVID-19 alone, as they could be due to leptospirosis and dengue fever.

Ernakulam is the central business district of the city of Kochi in Ernakulam district, Kerala, India, located 220 km (137 mi) northwest of the state capital Thiruvananthapuram; the city is drenched by the South-west monsoon from June to September, with October and November forming the post monsoon season (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernakulam). A map showing the location of Ernakulam can be found at https://www.google.com/maps/place/Ernakulam,+Kerala,+India.

Leptospirosis is a zoonotic bacterial infection that is widely distributed throughout the world in warm climates and is transmitted to humans by direct contact of abraded skin or mucous membranes with the urine of _Leptospira_-infected animals or by contact with water, wet soil, or vegetation that has been contaminated with infected animal urine. _Leptospira_ may survive in warm fresh water or soil flooded with fresh water for weeks to months. Drinking contaminated water or food can also cause infection.

In carrier animals with chronic renal infections, _Leptospira_ are excreted in urine for long periods or for the life of the animal. Many species of wild and domestic animals (including dogs, cattle, swine, and especially rats) are susceptible to chronic kidney infection with pathogenic _Leptospira_. Mice, as well as rats, can carry _Leptospira_ in their urine and serve as a reservoir for this organism (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6612401).

There are more than 250 serovars of _Leptospira_ species, with multiple serovars being endemic in a given geographic area. Prevalence of particular leptospiral serovars vary by geographical region.

Human activities that place people at increased risk of leptospirosis include contact with rats or domestic animals (cattle, pigs, and dogs), walking barefoot in water or mud, gardening, or farming, and working in piggeries. Some names for leptospirosis are derived from the environmental situations associated with occupations or groups at risk of developing the disease, such as swineherd's disease, rice-field fever, canecutter's fever or disease, swamp fever, and mud fever.

Leptospirosis is also a risk during recreational activities, such as camping, fresh water swimming, canoeing, kayaking, rafting, golfing, and trail biking, that involve exposure to water in lakes, rivers, or ponds contaminated by urine from _Leptospira_-infected animals (https://www.cdc.gov/leptospirosis/exposure/index.html).

Because of the relatively nonspecific nature of the clinical presentation of leptospirosis, its diagnosis cannot be made confidently without laboratory confirmation (https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0242886). The diagnosis of leptospirosis requires confirmation by MAT (microscopic agglutination test) serology, but an IgM enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), IgM dipstick, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) have been used to confirm the diagnosis (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3939550/). However, laboratory diagnosis for leptospirosis may not be not widely available at a local level. Dr. Jan Clement has cautioned (see ProMED post Leptospirosis - Australia (03): (QL) comment 20210525.8380596) that Seoul hantavirus infection, also transmitted by rats, may be misdiagnosed as leptospirosis because its clinical manifestations mimic that of leptospirosis.

Treatment with antibiotics (penicillin and doxycycline) can be effective, especially if started early in the disease. For very ill patients, intensive care support and intravenous (IV) antibiotics may be necessary. In a flood-affected area, leptospirosis chemoprophylaxis is 200 mg of doxycycline, once a week for those exposed to contaminated floodwater or soil (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2018/infectious-diseases-related-to-travel/leptospirosis). Each 200-mg dose provides a benefit for up to 7 days, so the dose may be repeated if high-risk conditions persist longer than this.

Outbreaks of leptospirosis frequently follow heavy rainfall, flooding with fresh water, and increasing rodent numbers. Inadequate disposal of trash and debris provides a suitable habitat for a rodent infestation. - Mod.ML
