Commercial vanilla is already the 2nd most expensive spice, but the price is soaring this year [2016] due to poor harvests on plantations in Madagascar and Indonesia. Experts are warning that the lack of genetic diversity in agricultural vanilla, much of it stemming from a handful of cultivated clones that have been propagated for hundreds of years, makes them vulnerable to a catastrophic disease outbreak. Only 2 species of vanilla are used commercially.

Root rot, a fungal disease, is already rampant in areas of Madagascar's crop, and once it's there, it's there to stay. Some Malagasy farmers neglect their crops when vanilla prices are low, leaving them to overgrow and allowing diseases like root rot to establish a foothold. Sharman O'Neill, University of California, says that from the point of view of the vanilla plants, the disease is a death sentence.

Farmers will likely have to turn to wild vanilla [varieties] that can resist diseases like root rot -- but wild vanilla is vanishing across large swaths of its range.

[Root and/or stem rot of vanilla (_Vanilla_ species, family Orchidaceae) caused by the fungus _Fusarium oxysporum_ f.sp. _vanillae_ is the most significant disease of the crop and a major constraint to vanilla production worldwide. For example, it has been reported that all plantings were lost in Sumatra and about 2/3 of those in India. The disease can completely destroy a plantation within weeks.

The pathogen can survive in infected seedlings as well as in plant debris in soil for several years. It is soil borne and can also be spread with contaminated plant and other materials and by mechanical means (including human activities). Disease management is difficult due to the inaccessibility of underground plant parts to fungicides.

It usually requires an integrated approach and may include exclusion, phytosanitation, cultural practices, and drenching the soil with copper fungicides. Biological control methods and resistant vanilla cultivars are being developed, but breeding programmes are hampered by the scarcity of sources of resistance (as mentioned above) and lack of knowledge about pathogen/host interactions.

In Madagascar, by 2010, 80 percent of vanilla plantations were reported to be affected by fusarium diseases (ProMED-mail post 20101210.4399). _Phytophthora_ root rots of the crop are also know to occur in the country.
