[1] Nepal: dog bite, human cases
Date: Sat 2 Feb 2019
From: Sher Bahadur Pun <drsherbdr@yahoo.com> [edited]


In less than 3 weeks (7-29 Jan 2019), a total of 4 people (12 to 38 years of age) who were brought to Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital (STIDH) from different places in Nepal died of rabies. Patients were diagnosed with rabies on the basis of history of dog bite injuries and symptoms such as aerophobia and hydrophobia, but none showed any aggression during their admissions. They later died from complications.

Although the government is providing antirabies vaccines free of cost at all government hospitals, many people are still dying due to rabies and no significant reduction in number of cases from the previous decade has been observed. It is learned that people usually 1st go to nearby local medical shops after being bitten by animals, where they often receive an incorrect response, i.e., "not advised to vaccinate." Such advice is usually given by medical shopkeepers, when victims have minor wounds and scratches. According to these rabies patients, they in fact knew or heard about the antirabies vaccine, but despite pressure from their own family members to vaccinate, they ignored these suggestions, resulting in rabies disease.

[ProMED thanks Dr. Sher Bahadur Pun for this firsthand report. We contacted him prior to posting, and noted that the information is based on his personal communications with rabies patients and/or their relatives.

According to Nepal's annual reports on zoonoses to the OIE, the numbers of human cases of rabies, for the years 2015-2017, were, respectively, 10, 13 and 10. It may be assumed that human rabies in Nepal is underreported. - Mod.AS

At least 19 people from Shaibu Village in Traditional Authority Mkanda in Mulanje have been recommended for rabies treatment after eating beef suspected to be from a rabid cow. Mulanje District Hospital Integrated Diseases Surveillance and Response Coordinator Masilina Kausiwa Msamanyada said the hospital received reports from Village Headman Shaibu on 24 Jan 2019 that more than 130 people in his area ate beef suspected to be from an infected cow that was bitten by a rabid dog.

Msamanyada said following the tip, Mulanje District Hospital Rapid Response Team (DRRT) was sent for an investigation on 26 Jan 2019, when they confirmed the incident and assessed the affected people. "The team found that the cow had been sick for almost 4 days following the dog bite in December 2018, which was suspected to be rabid," she said.

[Although pasteurized milk and cooked meat are not expected to contain infectious rabies virus, which is inactivated by heat, ingesting any product from a rabid animal is not recommended.

It may be assumed that the decision to treat 19 of the 130 consumers of the beef was based upon the results of the epidemiological investigation; these 19 people might have been suspected of contact with the cow before, during, or immediately after the (illegal) butchering.

Ideally, rabies in the biting dog and the cow should have been laboratory confirmed. - Mod.AS

[3] Philippines: counterfeit antirabies vaccine warning

The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned against a counterfeit antirabies vaccine now circulating in the Philippines. "This Medical Product Alert relates to falsified VerorabÂ® vaccines that have been identified in the Philippines and reported to WHO. This vaccine is used for the prevention of rabies in children and adults. It can be used to protect those who are at risk of exposure to rabies (pre-exposure vaccination) or to prevent the development of rabies after exposure has occurred, usually following the bite of an animal suspected of having rabies (post-exposure prophylaxis)," WHO said in its advisory.

The genuine Verorab vaccine is manufactured by Sanofi Pasteur. The WHO said that "2 falsified vaccines have so far been discovered." It said that Verorab vaccines with batch numbers NIE35 and H1833 are counterfeit.

"The stated manufacturer, Sanofi Pasteur, has confirmed they did not manufacture these falsified vaccines," the WHO said in its Medical Product Alert. The health organization revealed that "there have been no known adverse reactions reported to WHO at this stage."

Further, "WHO requests increased vigilance within the supply chains of countries likely to be affected by these falsified vaccines. Increased vigilance should include hospitals, clinics, health centres, wholesalers, distributors, pharmacies and any other suppliers of vaccines," it said.

"If you are in possession of the above vaccines, please do not use. If you have used these falsified vaccines, or if you suffer an adverse event having used these vaccines, please seek immediate advice from a qualified healthcare professional, and ensure they report the incident to your local Ministry of Health/National Medicines Regulatory Authorities/National Pharmacovigilance Center," WHO said.

The Philippines Food and Drug Administration (FDA), in a recent statement, said it received a complaint from The Medical City [Hospital, Metro Manila] regarding counterfeit antirabies vaccines that they had procured. The FDA said the counterfeit vaccines do not contain labels about its FDA-licensed Philippine importer and distributor, FDA registration number, Rx symbol, FDA caution statement on dispensing, and a barcode.

The alleged distributor of the counterfeit antirabies vaccine, based on the complaint lodged by The Medical City, was identified as Geramil Trading located in Calumpit, Bulacan. "FDA dispatched a team to The Medical City and was able to acquire copies of their transaction with Geramil Trading. Sanofi Pasteur's verification indicated that the submitted sample Verorab vaccine is not a legitimate and registered product," the agency said.

"Various FDA teams have begun scouring different hospitals in Pampanga and Bulacan who may have procured the counterfeit vaccines from Geramil Trading and prevent them from further dispensing said products to the public," the FDA said.

Health Secretary Francisco Duque III, in a radio interview Friday [1 Feb 2019], said the Department of Health (DOH) is now coordinating with the WHO in conducting an investigation. The DOH regional offices were also directed to visit all hospitals and other places that these counterfeit antirabies vaccines may have reached and confiscate the fake products, he added.
