Possible role of songbirds and parakeets in transmission of influenza A(H7N9) virus to humans
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Authors: Jones JC, Sonnberg S, Kocer ZA, Shanmuganatham K, Seiler P, Shu Y, et al.]

Abstract
--------
Avian-origin influenza A(H7N9) recently emerged in China, causing severe human disease. Several subtype H7N9 isolates contain influenza genes previously identified in viruses from finch-like birds. Because wild and domestic songbirds interact with humans and poultry, we investigated the susceptibility and transmissibility of subtype H7N9 in these species. Finches, sparrows, and parakeets supported replication of a human subtype H7N9 isolate, shed high titers through the oropharyngeal route, and showed few disease signs. Virus was shed into water troughs, and several contact animals seroconverted, although they shed little virus. Our study demonstrates that a human isolate can replicate in and be shed by such songbirds and parakeets into their environment. This finding has implications for these birds' potential as intermediate hosts with the ability to facilitate transmission and dissemination of A(H7N9) virus.

The humble budgie has become an unexpected menace in the latest H7N9 bird flu outbreak.

H7N9 emerged in south-east China last March [2013], infecting 136 people. It returned in October [2013], infecting 116 more. Nearly 1/3rd of those infected have died.

The virus cannot spread readily between people, and most cases are linked to live poultry markets. But now Jeremy Jones at St Jude Children's Research Hospital in Tennessee and colleagues in China report that budgies, finches and sparrows can contract H7N9. They can shed enough virus from their beaks into drinking water to infect other birds (Emerging Infectious Diseases [item 1 above]).

These species are popular pets in China, especially for older men, who have disproportionately contracted H7N9. They also figure in Buddhist ceremonies in which birds are kissed, then released.

Meanwhile, another virus has emerged from the Chinese poultry industry. H10N8 killed an elderly woman last year [2013], and now a younger woman is critically ill.

[Subscribers are referred to the full text at the source URL for item 1. The concluding section of the discussion chapter includes the following observations (summarised):

"To expand on our findings, future studies should include the examination of genetic changes in the human A(H7N9) virus during replication and transmission in the songbirds and parakeets. The human isolate we used contained genetic markers indicating adaptation to mammals. Sequence analysis of virus shed by the small birds in our study might indicate which species would be most receptive to transmission. The loss of the markers of mammalian adaptation and reversion to an avian-like genotype might predispose the virus to transmission from the small birds to poultry and other birds, rather than to humans. Additionally, studies that assess the sharing of housing, water, and food by inoculated songbirds and poultry (particularly chickens or quail) would shed light on the interspecies transmission potential of A(H7N9) viruses.

"Our demonstration that parakeets and multiple species of songbirds are susceptible to influenza A(H7N9) virus isolated from humans during the recent outbreak in China, further supports the possible contribution of songbirds and parakeets to the ecology, maintenance, and transmission of novel A(H7N9) viruses. Finally, they lead us to propose that finches, sparrows, and parakeets may be intermediate hosts and sources of A(H7N9) viruses and that their frequent interaction with wild birds, domestic poultry, and humans renders them a particular risk factor in the emergence and transmission of novel influenza strains". - Mod.AS]

Pushing the number of cases in the 2nd H7N9 influenza wave higher than the 1st, China reported 6 more cases today [30 Jan 2014], as well as 2 more deaths, one of which involved a previously confirmed case.

Today's new cases lift the number reported in the 2nd wave to 137, topping the 136 cases reported during the 1st wave last spring [2013].

Cases in the 2nd wave are piling up faster than during the 1st wave. The 1st wave reached 136 cases in 158 days, according to a CIDRAP analysis of illness-onset dates. But it took the 2nd wave, which began in early October [2013], to reach the same number of cases in only 105 days. And the pace in the past few weeks has been especially brisk.

The 2 new deaths reported today [30 Jan 2014] raise the outbreak's unofficial fatality count to 60.

Studies shed light on airway attachment, lab capacity
-----------------------------------------------------
In H7N9 research developments, an international team based at Erasmus University in the Netherlands compared H7N9 virus airway attachment in different animal models and humans and found that the pattern in macaques, mice, and to some extent pigs and guinea pigs, resembles that in humans. The team published its findings yesterday [29 Jan 2014] online in the Journal of Virology [J.Y. Siegersa, K.R. Shorta, L.M.E. Leijtena, M.de Graafa et al. (2014). Novel Avian-Origin Influenza A (H7N9) Virus Attachment to the Respiratory Tract of Five Animal Models. J. Virol. JVI.03190-13; published ahead of print 29 Jan 2014. doi: 10.1128/JVI.03190-13. Abstract at http://jvi.asm.org/content/early/2014/01/24/JVI.03190-13.short].

The attachment for those animals was more similar to humans than the pattern they saw in ferrets. They wrote that the findings shed more light on different animal models for influenza.

Meanwhile, a review of the capacity of European labs to detect the H7N9 virus found that 27 of 29 countries said that their generic influenza A detection assays will correctly detect the new virus, according to a report in today's issue of Eurosurveillance [Vol 19, 4, 30 Jan 2014, at http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=20682].

Overall, 28 of 31 labs in those 27 countries reported having the ability to subtype H7 viruses, with the remaining 3 labs proposing to send their non-subtypeable viruses to a WHO in London.

The survey also found that 22 countries have containment facilities that are appropriate for isolating and propagating the H7N9 virus. Those and other findings suggest that the European Reference Laboratory Network for Human Influenza (ERLI-Net) has quickly adopted good capabilities to detect H7N9 viruses.

Questions raised about China's poultry surveillance
---------------------------------------------------
Despite the reports that many patients in both waves of the outbreak were exposed to poultry or their environments, China's agriculture ministry today [30 Jan 2014] downplayed the connection between poultry and human illnesses.

An official from China's agriculture ministry said that so far there is no proof of direct H7N9 transmission from poultry to humans, according to a report from CCTV News, the English language news channel of China Central Television, based in Beijing. Zhang Zhongqiu, the ministry's bureau director, said so far this year only 8 of 33 000 samples were positive for the virus, and all were from live-poultry markets.

A similar pattern was seen during poultry testing last spring in the wake of the 1st wave of human infections, a puzzling aspect of the outbreak, especially when human H7N9 illnesses in disease hot spots dropped soon after poultry markets were shuttered.

Dave Halvorson, DVM, an avian health expert at the University of Minnesota in St. Paul, told CIDRAP News that media reports describing China's poultry testing techniques raise questions about their effectiveness.

He said a ProMED-mail post on a recent report from China's agriculture ministry to the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) suggests that Chinese scientists are using polymerase chain reaction and viral isolation testing to monitor poultry. ProMED-mail is the Internet reporting service of the International Society for Infectious Diseases.

He said the surveillance method they are using has little value, because the low-pathogenic virus causes few if any signs in poultry. "It's akin to looking for human influenza virus by sampling clinically healthy people Â­- you won't find much virus."

"I call this type of surveillance 'looking for negatives,' because the probability of finding virus in healthy birds is so low," Halvorson said.

Because low-pathogenic viruses don't typically make poultry sick, the most effective method is active serologic monitoring, he said. In contrast, passive surveillance for highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses is highly effective, because of severe illness in affected poultry.

On 16 Jan 2014, Hong Kong's government announced that it had reached an agreement with mainland officials on an H7 serology testing program for mainland farms that supply poultry to Hong Kong. The program began on 24 Jan 2014 and will also apply to local poultry farms in Hong Kong, according to a government statement. It said tests add another surveillance measure to the already tight systems in place to prevent the introduction of H7N9 to Hong Kong flocks.

Hong Kong announced the serology testing program for poultry a few days before other tests found H7N9 in poultry from a certified farm in the mainland's Guangdong province that had been brought into a Hong Kong wholesale market. The findings triggered the closure of the live-poultry market for 3 weeks and the culling of more than 20 000 birds at the site [see comment].

[The comments of Dr Halvorson deserve serious consideration [item #3 above]. Hong Kong's concern about the issue has been recently underlined by the 1st detection of H7N9 infection in a consignment of poultry (silky fowl) in a local market after its import to Hong Kong from the mainland; reported in ProMED-mail post 20140130.2242359. This finding was followed by the culling of 22 604 poultry, including 16 984 chickens, 2898 silky fowls, 1080 pheasants, and 1642 pigeons. Importation of live poultry and movement of poultry in local Hong Kong farms have been banned for 21 days. - Mod.AS
