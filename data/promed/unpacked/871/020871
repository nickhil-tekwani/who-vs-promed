On Wed 7 Jun 2007, health officials warned Missourians to guard against
tick bites, after the death of a child bitten by a tick in a north eastern
part of the state.
The child became ill after being bitten by a tick and died 23 May 2007,
after 10 days of intensive medical care, health officials said. Tests
performed at St Louis Children's Hospital showed the child was infected
with ehrlichiosis, a disease [somewhat - Mod.LL] related to Rocky Mountain
spotted fever, said Dr Howard Pue, Missouri's public health veterinarian.
State officials declined to release any additional information about where
the child may have been bitten.
"This is a phenomenon we're seeing statewide. We didn't want to give the
impression that north east Missouri was particularly hard hit," said Karen
Yates, a Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services specialist in
tick- and mosquitoborne diseases.
The state health department reports a 2007 rise in tickborne diseases such
as ehrlichiosis and Rocky Mountain spotted fever. Other tickborne diseases
reported in Missouri in 2007 include tularemia and Lyme-like disease.
"Serious complications from ehrlichiosis are rare, but a death like this of
an otherwise healthy child is a solemn reminder of the importance of
avoiding tick bites to reduce the risk of getting a tick-borne disease,"
Pue said. He said the [fatality] risk is low, but early symptoms are
difficult to distinguish from other diseases.
So far, 16 cases of ehrlichiosis have been reported. In the past 5 years,
Missouri has seen an average of 9 cases per year during the same time
period. Officials said 54 cases of Rocky Mountain spotted fever have been
reported so far, with an average of 22 cases per year over the past 5
years. Other tickborne diseases reported in Missouri this year [2007]
include 2 cases of tularemia and 10 cases of Lyme-like disease.
Tickborne illnesses cannot be quickly diagnosed through testing, but
treatment decisions will be made on clinical evidence and the likelihood of
tick exposure, officials said. They said if a person has been bitten by a
tick and experiences a sudden fever, headache, rash, achy muscles and
nausea, the person should contact a doctor for evaluation. Tickborne
diseases can be effectively treated with appropriate antibiotics,
especially when caught at an early stage, Pue added.

[The following information about ehrlichiosis is abstracted from the CDC
website <http://www.cdc.gov/Ncidod/dvrd/ehrlichia/Index.htm>
"The genus _Ehrlichia_, of the family _Rickettsiaceae_, includes 7
recognized species: _E. canis_, _E. chaffeensis_, _E. equi_, _E.
phagocytophila_, _E. risticii_, _E. ewingii_, and _E. sennetsu_. A number
of other named ehrlichiae, such as "_E. platys_," "_E. bovis_," _E.
ovina_," and "_E. ondiri_," also cause disease in animals. The names of the
latter organisms are enclosed in quotation marks because they have not been
formally proposed and accepted according to the rules of the International
Code of Nomenclature of Bacteria, Bacteriological Code.
"The ehrlichiae were initially grouped according to the type of blood cell
most commonly infected (granulocyte, lymphocyte, monocyte, platelet), and
disease classes have been termed "granulocytic (or granulocytotropic)
ehrlichiosis" or "monocytic (or monocytotropic) ehrlichiosis." However,
this type of classification may be misleading because some of the
_Ehrlichia_ species have been found in cells other than their chief target
cell type. In addition, more than one species may be responsible for the
broad category of "monocytic" or "granulocytic" ehrlichiosis).
"_Ehrlichia chaffeensis_ infections (often referred to as human monocytic
ehrlichiosis, HME) are most frequently reported from south eastern and mid
western states with abundant lone star tick (_Amblyomma americanum_)
populations, especially Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Missouri, North
Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia. Cases have been
reported from almost every state in the USA, although some of these may
have been imported from states where the disease is highly endemic.
"Most of the recognized human granulocytic ehrlichiosis (HGE) cases have
originated from states that also have a high incidence of Lyme disease,
particularly Connecticut, Minnesota, New York, and Wisconsin. This
distribution is consistent with the fact that the vector of HGE, _Ixodes
scapularis_, also transmits _Borrelia burgdorferi_. A number of other
states have also reported HGE cases. In the western USA, the HGE agent is
transmitted by the western blacklegged tick, _Ixodes pacificus_.
"The early clinical presentations of ehrlichiosis may resemble nonspecific
signs and symptoms of various other infectious and non-infectious diseases.
It is unclear if all persons infected with ehrlichiae become ill. It is
possible that many infected persons develop an illness so mild they do not
seek medical attention or perhaps have no symptoms at all.
"Patients with ehrlichiosis generally visit a physician in their 1st week
of illness, following an incubation period of about 5-10 days after the
tick bite. Initial symptoms generally include fever, headache, malaise, and
muscle aches. Other signs and symptoms may include nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea, cough, joint pains, confusion, and occasionally rash. In contrast
to Rocky Mountain spotted fever, rash is relatively uncommon in adult
patients with HME, and is rarely reported with HGE. However, rash has been
described in approximately 60 per cent of pediatric patients infected with
_E. chaffeensis_. Laboratory findings indicative of ehrlichiosis include
leucopenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated liver enzymes.
"Ehrlichiosis can be a severe illness, especially if untreated, and as many
as half of all patients require hospitalization. Severe manifestations of
the disease may include prolonged fever, renal failure, disseminated
intravascular coagulopathy, meningoencephalitis, adult respiratory distress
syndrome, seizures, or coma. It is estimated that 2-3 per cent of patients
may die from the infection. Preliminary evidence suggests that _E.
chaffeensis_ infection may become more severe than other ehrlichial infections.
"The severity of ehrlichiosis may be related in part to the immune status
of the patient. Persons with compromised immunity caused by
immunosuppresive therapies (such as corticosteroids or cancer
chemotherapy), HIV infection, or splenectomy appear to develop more severe
disease, and case-fatality ratios for these individuals are
characteristically higher than case-fatality ratios reported for the
general population.
"Appropriate antibiotic treatment should be initiated immediately when
there is a strong suspicion of ehrlichiosis on the basis of clinical and
epidemiologic findings. Treatment should not be delayed until laboratory
confirmation is obtained. Fever generally subsides within 24-72 hours after
treatment with doxycycline or other tetracyclines. In fact, failure to
rapidly respond to a tetracycline antibiotic argues against a diagnosis of
ehrlichiosis. Preventative therapy in non-ill patients who have had recent
tick bites is not warranted.
"Doxycycline (100 mg twice daily for adults or 4.4 mg/kg body weight per
day in 2 divided doses for children under 45.4 kg (100 lb)) is the drug of
choice for patients with ehrlichiosis. The optimal duration of therapy has
not been established, but current regimens recommend continuation of
treatment for at least 3 days after the fever subsides and until evidence
of clinical improvement, for a minimum total course of 5 to 7 days. Severe
or complicated disease may require longer treatment courses. Because
tetracyclines are contraindicated in pregnancy, rifampin has been used
successfully in a limited number of pregnant women with documented HGE."
If the tick population in a area rises, the number of tick-related human
infections rises as well. An image of _A. americanum_ can be seen at
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvbid/images/amblyomma-americanum.jpg>. It is
not stated in the posting but this is likely to be _E. chaffeensis_ based
on the severity of illness and acquisition state. Missouri is in the
central USA and can be located on the map at
