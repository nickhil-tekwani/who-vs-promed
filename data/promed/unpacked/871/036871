[The update report from Spain covers 14 farms that are spread over a
wide area in Andalusia, the most southern part of Spain that borders
the Straits of Gibraltar. Likewise, in Macedonia, Greece, the 7 farms
are spread over a wide geographic area. Vaccination is an effective
control measure but it may be that the epidemic won't end until there
is a hard frost, which will reduce the transmission of the West Nile
virus to horses by killing off the mosquito populations.

The follow up no. 1 report from Spain has quite an interesting anomaly
which I have rarely seen while watching OIE WAHID reports for over a
decade -- there are no diagnostic test reports to confirm the
diagnosis of West Nile virus in horses from the 14 farms. In the
original report from Spain both IgM capture ELISA and competitive
ELISA were used to identify positive horses. I suspect the same tests
were used to confirm the horses in follow up report no. 1.

The location of the outbreaks can be seen on the maps appended to the
respective OIE-WAHID reports
