The Equine Disease Communication Center (EDCC) reported [Tue 29 May 2018] the Texas Animal Health Commission (TAHC) confirmed equine herpes myeloencephalopathy (EHM, the neurologic form of equine herpesvirus-1, EHV-1), in a Williamson County barrel racing horse on [Thu 24 May 2018].

This is the 3rd EHM case diagnosed in Texas horses this month [May 2018].

"The newly identified horse showed signs of nasal discharge and ataxia when evaluated by a local veterinarian and EHV-1 was confirmed by a recognized laboratory," the EDCC statement said. "The premises are under movement restrictions and TAHC staff (are) working closely with the owner and veterinarian to monitor potentially exposed horses and implement biosecurity measures.

"Prior to confirmation of EHM, the horse attended a private training facility in Liberty Hill, Texas, on [Fri 11 May 2018] and barrel racing events at the Killeen Rodeo Outdoor Arena on [Sat 12 May 2018] and Williamson County Expo Center on [Sat 5 May 2018]," the EDCC said. "(The) TAHC has contacted event management, veterinarians, and the training facility to ensure enhanced surveillance and biosecurity measures are taken."

Herpesvirus is highly contagious among horses and can cause a variety of ailments in equids, including rhinopneumonitis (a respiratory disease usually found in young horses), abortion in broodmares, and EHM. In many horses, the only sign of EHV-1 infection is fever, which can go undetected.

In addition to fever, other common signs of EHV-1 infection in young horses include cough, decreased appetite, depression, and a nasal discharge. Pregnant mares typically show no signs of infection before they abort, and abortions usually occur late in gestation (around 8 months) but can be earlier. Abortions can occur anywhere from 2 weeks to several months following infection with EHV-1.

Horses with the neurologic form usually have a fever at the onset of the disease and might show signs of a respiratory infection. A few days later, neurologic signs such as ataxia (incoordination), weakness or paralysis of the fore - and hind limbs, urine retention and dribbling, loss of tail tone, and recumbency (inability to rise) develop.

The appearance of equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy (EHM) in Stutsman County has led to a 2nd riding event cancellation.

The St. Judes Ride and Roast Beef Supper scheduled for [Sat 9 Jun 2018] was cancelled after 3 horses showing advanced symptoms of EHM were euthanized this month [May 2018], said Betty Job, president of the Windsor Horse Club. The 1st horse put down was tested and confirmed to have the disease, she said.

"The horses belonged to my sister's herd," Job said.

One of the horses had just given birth, she said. The bottle-fed colt was isolated on another ranch while the remainder of the herd and an employee's herd are showing no signs about halfway through a 30-day EHM quarantine, she said.

The risk of an infected horse, person's clothing or equipment coming in contact with other horses was just too much to risk to hold the ride, Job said.

"I have an older stallion and don't want it to die from something like that," she said.

The ride and dinner benefit will likely be rescheduled in the fall, she said.

The Circle Cross Riding Club also posted on its Facebook page that an upcoming show was called off and rescheduled for [Sat 8 Sep 2018].

Alicia Harstad, extension agent in agriculture and natural resources with North Dakota State University Extension Stutsman County, said a decision will be made in a few weeks whether the agency's horse show will be held this year [2018] at the Stutsman County Fair. It would be disappointing to cancel and a decision now would be premature, she said.

"We are definitely thinking about it and it will ultimately be up to the horse owners and how comfortable horse owners are or not," Harstad said.

By the time a horse reaches maturity it has likely been infected with EHV-1 (Equine herpesvirus 1) and is a latent carrier of the virus, according to the American Association of Equine Practitioners. While contracting the deadly form EHM is rare there are no available vaccines and the EHV-1 vaccines can help prevent spread of the virus, Harstad said.

There is always a risk when horses travel and owners should do all they can to practice biosecurity, Harstad said. That includes not sharing buckets, feed and equipment and keeping other horses and owners at a distance, she said.

"It is an unfortunate thing to have a horse pass away but it also serves as a good reminder for people that these things are always out there and tend to emerge at different times," Harstad said.

Horses travel around more in the spring which is usually why there are more cases reported from contact, said Deputy State Veterinarian Beth Carlson.

"We've been getting a lot of calls from people who are concerned," Carlson said.

It's understandable that trail ride and event organizers want to act on the best information available and not out of fear and rumors, she said. The best prevention resources and latest information on confirmed cases are posted on the North Dakota Department of Agriculture's EHV-1, webpage at https://bit.ly/2IHBn9C.

"It is important to practice good biosecurity and when traveling it's important to know what things to do before you go and while you're at events," Carlson said.

EHM can remain dormant for some time, she said. Most horses respond well and recover but some do not, she said.

A horse with a runny nose or fever is not a danger sign in itself but it is unusual when the symptoms linger, she said. Minimize exposure risks during travel and events by staying the minimum time necessary, she said.

"Any time a horse has a fever that is not resolved and is showing neurological signs of EHM it is time to consult a veterinarian," Carlson said. "You don't call the doctor for every fever but when it's really high or is not going away in a reasonable time that is considered abnormal."

[The show schedule for the horse in Texas seemed pretty heavy. Constant travel and performance stresses a horse leaving them prone to diseases. Animals need down time to recover from the stresses of travel and performance.

Biosecurity while on the road and at the shows is a very very important issue. Unfortunately, many folks get relaxed about the biosecurity issues when traveling or being housed in surroundings unfamiliar to the animal.

When you plan a travel/performance schedule for you and your animals, consider the stress on your animal and the possibility of a life threatening illness. When traveling or stabling on the road at a show, please be taking and recording your animal's temperature. A slight rise in body temperature may be the earliest sign of something being out of the ordinary.

North Dakota seems to be taking this disease quite seriously and is trying to protect other horses by cancelling some of the events where horses could be exposed since they have had cases of this nasty disease.

It is a nasty disease and unfortunately we read more about horses succumbing to this disease than overcoming it.

Please be taking your animal's temperature at least twice daily and recording it. Practice extreme biosecurity to increase your chances of protecting your animal and use what vaccines are available, although the neurological form of this disease does not have a vaccine.
