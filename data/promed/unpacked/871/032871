Important clarification
-----------------------
An article titled "Ebola has gotten so bad, it's normal" published on Foreign Policy's website, dated 15 Jan 2019, contains several dubious and problematic allegations that are not based on any documented scientific or objective fact.
1. Health workers were not threatened by "soldiers, gangs, arms traffickers, and rapists"
- The majority of assaults and physical threats by agents are perpetrated by Ebola-affected communities themselves.
- Several Ebola cases have already been detected in areas controlled by armed groups that have agreed to work with the response teams to contain the epidemic as quickly as possible in their areas of influence.

2. The article makes inappropriate links between the possible sexual transmission of the Ebola virus by survivors and the problem of the use of rape as a weapon of war.
- Since the beginning of the epidemic in North Kivu province 1 Aug 2018, the Armed Forces of the DRC (FARDC) work alongside the response teams to ensure the protection of health workers in so-called "red" zones. No cases of military rape or rape contamination have been reported in areas affected by the epidemic.
- The claim that "raping and pillaging soldiers" could spread the virus is inappropriate and based on no objective evidence.
- Furthermore, the claim that "rape is simply a fact of life for women" in this region is extremely degrading and insulting, especially since all patients, survivors, and their families are followed by clinical psychologists. In their reports, rape was not mentioned in any case as a cause of trauma in the populations affected by the Ebola epidemic.

[2] Problems
- Sun 27 Jan 2019. Ebola patients stranded by violence in Democratic Republic of Congo
[PBS NewsHour, abridged, edited]
https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/ebola-patients-stranded-by-violence-in-democratic-republic-of-congo

An Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo is growing, the World Health Organization said [Fri 25 Jan 2019], having killed 436 of more than 700 infected. This region also volatile, where health workers are attacked and armed conflict is preventing emergency responses for treatment. International Rescue Committee's Stacey Mearns joins Hari Sreenivasan [PBS NewsHour journalist] for more.

- Hari Sreenivasan:
On [Fri 25 Jan 2019], the World Health Organization released a new report showing that the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo is growing. Stacey Mearns, the Ebola Response Program Director for the International Rescue Committee joins us now via Skype from the Democratic Republic of Congo.

Thanks for being with us. So, what is it about this particular part of this outbreak? I mean this has been going on since August [2018], that is of concern to you now.

- Stacey Mearns:
I think the situation on the ground remains complex and very challenging. We're currently at 733 cases with 446 deaths. And the biggest challenge is that this outbreak is occurring in what is a very dynamic and volatile security situation. Over the last month in particular, we've seeing election related unrest and protests, we've seen attacks on health facilities and the Ebola response and we've seen ongoing active conflict and attacks from armed rebel groups. This has directly impacted the response.

Over the Christmas [2018] period, several agencies including the IRC had to temporarily suspend programming and evacuate staff. Across the response, we had a 3 to 4 day complete shutdown of response activities and we're currently now seeing the effect of that. So particular in the last 2 weeks we're seeing an increase in case numbers. Over the past week, we've recorded the biggest number of cases on a daily basis.
And we've also seen increasing geographic spread of the outbreak.

- Fri 25 Jan 2019. Mabuku (North Kivu): Patients sometimes 2 to 2 on the bed at the risk of being contaminated by Ebola
[Radio Moto Butembo-Beni, in French, machine trans., edited]
http://radiomotofm.info/lirearticle.php?billet=5346

This situation is experienced in this part of the territory of Beni. Many families in Mabuku prefer to seek treatment at health posts these days of the Ebola outbreak. A dangerous situation because in view of the high number of patients, the medical staff is forced to have sometimes 2 patients on a single bed.

"Even those who do not have this disease, they always say that the patients re attacked, even if they only have a fever. Yet we have known for a long time that the temperature of the patient does not remain the same. But right now, if you die, is it really Ebola?"

When asked about this, one of the leaders of Mabuku health posts said they are raising awareness at the Mabuku health post for the prevention of the disease. "We are lucky here at home because we have not yet received a case but we are asking patients to wash. We are also doing other tests to find out something about the fever, " she said.

Community outreach was conducted in Mabuku by the response team and the rural health area of Kalunguta to counter the rumors. Paluku Kasughu John is the TDR. "It was in the context of sensitizing the population about the Ebola virus disease, because it is a disease that is not yet in the health area of Mabuku, but in the vicinity, because it has always been said that prevention is better than recovery. We advise the population of Mabuku to take the appropriate hygiene measures," he said.

[When a patient presents at a clinic with a fever, it would be best if there were a rapid test to confirm Ebola or another disease, such as malaria. Patients could then be segregated according to infection and prevent contamination of infected individuals with Ebola. Having 2 patients together sharing a bed when neither has been diagnosed is particularly risky. - Mod.LK]

[3] Education campaign
- Sat 26 Jan 2019. Beni: Launch of the Ebola Student Awareness Campaign
[Radio Okapi, in French, machine trans., edited]
https://www.radiookapi.net/2019/01/26/actualite/sante/beni-lancement-de-la-campagne-de-sensibilisation-des-eleves-contre-ebola

The NGO Alliance for International Medical Action (ALIMA) launched on Fri 25 Jan 2019 in Beni (North Kivu) the awareness campaign for primary school pupils in the fight against Ebola virus disease. The kick-off was given at Kasabinyole EP [primary school] in Rwenzori commune.

Hundreds of primary school students have been sensitized on practices to combat the Ebola epidemic. This campaign, supported by the NGO ALIMA, is carried out through games, participatory theater and scenarios that explain the mode of transmission of Ebola, the consequences of the resistance and the measures to be taken to protect against this epidemic.

School officials believe the campaign will help protect not only schoolchildren, but also their families and the entire community.

"The children are very happy. They are very proud of this awareness, because it is also done by a theater presentation and the children are very interested. I think it's an awareness that will help many kids, who will even help their families. Because the children will transmit the message received to their parents, brothers, and sisters at home, "said Thembo Muyamba, director of Kasabinyole EP.

The epidemiological situation of Ebola virus disease in the provinces of North Kivu and Ituri, as presented by the Ministry of Public Health on Fri 25 Jan 2019, shows a cumulative number of 715 cases, of which 666 were confirmed and 49 probable. There were 443 deaths, 248 people cured, and 236 suspected cases under investigation.

[Teaching the children about safety precautions to prevent infection with Ebola is an excellent approach. They will bring this new information home to their mothers in particular as well as to other family members. This is a more promising approach than having healthcare workers educate the villagers directly. - Mod.LK
