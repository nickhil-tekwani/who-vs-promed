Concerns about the spread of a respiratory disease among children are
growing more serious for parents in Hanoi, as an increasing number of
young patients are hospitalised with the virus. A report from the
Hanoi-based Central Hospital for Paediatrics stated that for 2 weeks
now, thousands of children have been hospitalised every day to be
checked. Many of the young patients were found to be suffering from
respiratory disease.
On Tuesday [21 Feb 2006] morning, 3/4 of the 900 children at the
hospital showed [some] of the disease's symptoms, including coughing,
high fever and diarrhoea. According to the hospital's deputy
director, Dr Nguyen Van Loc, the reason for the increasing number of
affected children was the recent change in seasons, which gave rise
to favourable conditions for viruses and bacteria to flourish and
affect children. According to the hospital's doctors, the disease
usually affects small children but this year had spread to children
aged from 3 to 15. Children with weak resistance to viruses were
especially prone [to infection] in schools with overcrowded
classrooms.
Saint Paul Hospital in Hanoi has received over 1500 children affected
by respiratory diseases. Many of them were diagnosed with adenovirus
[infection]. Most sick children were taken to hospital in a timely
manner, so many of them have recovered and been discharged from the
hospital, said Minh Thu, head of Saint Paul's Diagnosis Department.
Adenovirus is a common virus that flourishes between winter and
spring. It claimed the life of one student at Quang An Primary
School, Tay Ho District, earlier in February 2006. After the death,
hundreds of the victim's fellow students didn't attend class for fear
of catching the disease.
Dr Nguyen Van Loc warned parents to take careful precautions
to keep their children warm and minimise their exposure to sudden
changes in temperature. The disease spreads via the respiratory
system, said Dr Loc, so children should maintain good dental hygiene
as well as practise food safety and general hygiene. Children should
also be isolated from other children who had contracted the disease,
he said. Dr Loc said the disease involved almost no symptoms during
its first 2 days. But after that period, children affected by the
virus would feel tired and suffer from high fevers rising up to 39-40
deg C. In this case, children should be brought to hospital
immediately for appropriate treatment, he said.

[If this outbreak of febrile respiratory infection and diarrhoea is
indeed associated with adenovirus infection, the etiologic agent may
be adenovirus serotype 40 or 41 (_Human adenovirus F_), serotype 31
(_Human adenovirus A_), or serotype 2 (_Human adenovirus C_). Then
again, the diagnosis may be intended to reassure the population that
the outbreak is not caused by avian influenza virus. - Mod.CP]
