Poliovirus missing after South Africa carjacking
------------------------------------------------
A shipment of potentially infectious poliovirus destined for a South
African research centre is missing after the vehicle carrying it was
hijacked in Johannesburg, officials said Wednesday [4 May 2011]. The
potentially deadly virus is considered a biohazard, said South
Africa's National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD), though
the government research centre's deputy director downplayed the threat
of a polio outbreak.

"The risk is fairly small, but we'd like to advise that if the
package was found for the public not to tamper with it. Simply return
it to the NICD or to the police," Adrian Puren told AFP [Agence
France-Presse]. He said there was no risk the package could be used in
a terrorist attack and that the carjackers who stole the courier
vehicle carrying it probably did not realize what the box contained --
stool specimens from the Congo being sent to the NICD for polio
testing. The NICD said the vehicle was stolen Tuesday [3 May 2011] and
later recovered, but that the specimen shipment was missing.
Carjacking is a pervasive problem in South Africa, which has some of
the highest crime rates in the world. Nearly 14 000 carjackings were
reported to police last year [2010].

[It is unlikely that this incident has any bioterrorism connotations.
Fecal samples from Congolese patients could have no commercial value
and in any case are replaceable. However, until the material is
located its loss constitutes a biohazard. It is likely that some of
the samples, presumably originating from patients with symptoms of
poliomyelitis, could contain virulent poliovirus and are a danger to
any unimmunised person interfering with the packaging, or to others if
the package is abandoned. Poliovirus samples, particularly in
protective packaging for transmission of diagnostic samples, could
retain their infectivity for an appreciable period. Publication of the
incident and recovery of the package should be priorities. Anyone with
knowledge of the incident should contact the South African National
Institute for Communicable Diseases (Tel: +27 11 386 6000) and/or the
police immediately. - Mod.CP]
