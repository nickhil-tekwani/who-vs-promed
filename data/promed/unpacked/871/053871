Israel Health Ministry officials report 300 cases of children diagnosed with dysentery and according to ministry estimates, another 500 will likely contract it. The areas with the largest number of cases are Jerusalem and Ashkelon. The increase seems to occur during the summer months, but this year in 2016, the increase is more significant than in past summers.

Dysentery is an inflammation of the intestine causing diarrhea with blood. Other symptoms may include fever, abdominal pain, and rectal tenesmus (a feeling of incomplete defecation). It is caused by a number of types of infection such as bacteria, viruses, parasitic worms, or protozoa, and is a type of gastroenteritis. The mechanism is an inflammatory disorder of the intestine, especially of the colon. It more frequently strikes little children up to the age of 4, often due to the frequency of the little ones touching their fingers to their mouths.

Dysentery can spread easily in a daycare or kindergarten setting. Two reasons cited for an increase in cases during the summer months are the fact children are in swimming pools together and that food is often not properly refrigerated, providing a breeding ground for bacteria.

[_Shigella_ was discovered over 100 years ago by the Japanese microbiologist, Kiyoshi Shiga, for whom the genus is named. There are 4 species: _S. boydii_, _S. dysenteriae_, _S. flexneri_, and _S. sonnei_. _Shigella_ organisms can survive transit through the stomach since they are less susceptible to acid than other bacteria; for this reason, as few as 10 to 100 organisms can cause disease. Ingested bacteria pass into the small intestine where they multiply; large numbers of bacteria then pass into the colon, where they enter the colonic cells. Given its relatively low infectious dose, transmission can occur via contaminated food and water or via direct person-to-person spread including sexual practices more common in MSM (men who have sex with men). Humans are the only natural reservoir for the disease.

Dysentery (formerly known as flux or the bloody flux) is an inflammatory disorder of the colon, which results in severe diarrhea containing mucus and/or blood in the feces with fever, abdominal pain, and rectal tenesmus (pain while passing the diarrhea). - Mod.LL
