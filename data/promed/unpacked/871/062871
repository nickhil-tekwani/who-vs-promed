Re: Outbreak of Dengue Fever in Tamaulipas (Mexico)
---------------------------------------------------
[The following correction has been received from Dr. Richard Campman
regarding part [5] of the ProMED-mail post entitled "Dengue/DHF updates
(37): 23 Sep 2002". ProMED-mail regrets the error. The Associated Press
report was reproduced in good faith and there was no opportunity to verify
it in the time available. - Mod.CP]
The AP article describing dengue fever in Tamaulipas, Mexico, includes an
inaccuracy. The Texas Department of Health has neither tested nor confirmed
dengue fever in samples from the border city of Matamoros.
