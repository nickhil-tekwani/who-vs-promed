City health leaders are investigating a syphilis outbreak among older heterosexual men in Roseland in the Far South Side [city of Chicago].

Chicago Department of Public Health [CDPH] officials said Wednesday [8 Dec 2021] it recorded 919 cases of primary and secondary syphilis throughout the city in 2020, a 13 percent increase over 2019. Full data for 2021 is not yet complete, but officials say 5 men living in the Roseland area have been diagnosed with syphilis between [9 Sep and 4 Nov 2021]. All of the men are Black and reported having oral sex with female sex workers.

Syphilis is a sexually transmitted disease that can be spread through vaginal, oral, or anal sex. There are different stages but it often starts as a painful sore near the place of infection, 3 to 4 weeks after exposure, which often will heal on its own, according to CDPH and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC].

However, syphilis can have severe complications if left untreated, and often is known as The Great Imitator because its symptoms are unnoticed or easily mistaken for something else. Without medical attention, syphilis can progress to non-itchy rashes on the body. At its most severe, it can brain damage, blindness, dementia, organ damage, and death. Pregnant women can transmit the disease to a fetus, and syphilis also makes it easier to contract HIV, according to the CDPH.

[Because] syphilis can be cured with penicillin, health officials are urging anyone with symptoms to see a doctor immediately. The city operates 3 clinics that offer free testing, diagnosis, and treatment for STDs. Additional information and testing site locations are available at the CDPH website, from the CDC, or by talking to your medical provider.

["Roseland (pop, 42 505 residents in 2015) is one of the 77 official community areas of Chicago, Illinois, located on the far south side of the city. It includes the neighborhoods of Fernwood, Princeton Park, Lilydale, the southern portion of West Chesterfield, Rosemoor, Sheldon Heights, and West Roseland."
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roseland,_Chicago); a map showing the location of Roseland in the city of Chicago can be found at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:US-IL-Chicago-CA49.svg.

The news report above says that 5 men living in the Roseland area have been diagnosed with syphilis between 9 Sep and 4 Nov 2021; all 5 men reported having oral sex with female sex workers.

The latest comprehensive data for syphilis in the USA can be found at National overview - sexually transmitted disease surveillance, 2019 (https://www.cdc.gov/std/statistics/2019/overview.htm#Syphilis). The following is extracted from that report:

"Since reaching a historic low in 2000 and 2001, the rate of P&S (primary and secondary) syphilis has increased almost every year, increasing 11.2% during 2018-2019. Rates increased among both males and females, in all regions of the United States, and among all racial/Hispanic ethnicity groups.

"Since 2000, rates of P&S syphilis have increased among men, likely attributable to increases in cases among MSM [men who have sex with men]; however, increases among MSM may be slowing. In jurisdictions with a consistent collection of sex of sex partners, case counts among MSM were stable during 2018-2019. Still, MSM are disproportionately impacted, accounting for a majority (56.7%) of all male P&S syphilis cases in 2019. Although rates of P&S syphilis are lower among women, rates have increased substantially in recent years, increasing 30% during 2018-2019 and 178.6% during 2015-2019, suggesting the heterosexual syphilis epidemic continues to rapidly increase."

Syphilis, a chronic, multi-stage, human infection characterized by variable clinical symptoms, is a sexually transmitted infection caused by _Treponema pallidum_ subspecies _pallidum_. Although _T. pallidum_ has not been grown in vitro, its genome has been sequenced and provided possibilities for molecular diagnostics of syphilis. It would be interesting if DNA typing methods that have proven useful in identifying common-source outbreaks and understanding transmission pathways, for example, in food-borne bacterial infections, legionnaires' disease, and COVID-19, could be applied to outbreaks of syphilis, like the one that is occurring in Roseland, Chicago. Genotyping _T. pallidum_ in a sample taken from a diagnosed patient is reportedly being used to track a recent syphilis outbreak in Melbourne's outer suburbs (see ProMED post Syphilis - Australia: (VI) ocular, women, congenital, urban poor, genotyping, alert 20210518.8367315).

More information on this syphilis outbreak in Chicago would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.ML
