More West Nile Virus-positive Crows Reported in Illinois
-------------------------------------------------------------
A dead crow found in Rockford and 4 dead crows and a pool of mosquitoes
from Cook County have been reported as preliminarily positive for West Nile
virus, Dr. John R. Lumpkin, State Public Health Director, announced today.
No human cases of West Nile disease have been reported. These preliminary
test results are in addition to dead crows collected in Arlington Heights
(Cook County) and Lombard (DuPage County) that were confirmed positive for
West Nile virus on 5 Sep 2001 by the U.S. Geological Survey National
Wildlife Health Center in Madison, Wis.
The 5 dead crows were identified as preliminarily positive by the Illinois
Department of Agriculture laboratory in Galesburg. Samples from the birds
have been shipped to the U.S. Geological Survey lab in Madison, Wis., for
confirmatory testing that may not be completed for several weeks. The dead
birds were collected between 23 Aug and 5 Sep 2001 in the following
locations: Mount Prospect, Cook County (23 Aug); Burbank, Cook County (24
Aug); Crestwood, Cook County (3 Sep); Arlington Heights, Cook County (4
Sep); and Rockford, Winnebago County (5 Sep).
The preliminarily positive mosquitoes were collected on 4 Sep 2001 in
Palatine,
Cook County, by the Northwest Mosquito Abatement District and are pending
confirmation by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
"The fact West Nile virus is being found throughout the Chicago area and
now Rockford is consistent with what we would expect given that the virus
is carried by birds that can fly several hundred miles," Dr. Lumpkin said.
"People in Illinois should presume that West Nile virus is present
throughout the state and take the necessary precautions."
