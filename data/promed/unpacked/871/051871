The epidemiological situation of the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD)
- A total of 53 cases of haemorrhagic fever were reported in the region, of which 38 were confirmed and 15 were probable.
- 29 deaths were recorded, including 14 confirmed cases.

News from the Ebola response
System resilience
- The Minister of Health, Dr. Oly Ilunga Kalenga, validated the strategic plan for the consolidation and stabilization of the health system following the Ebola epidemic for the period August-October 2018.
- The Consolidation and Stabilization Strategic Plan is the product of the Mid-Term Strategic Review of the Ebola Response Activities, [Tue 3 to Thu 5 Jul 2018]. The plan's goal is to consolidate the gains of Ebola response, maintain increased vigilance, learn lessons, identify good practices for the future, and contribute to the resilience of the health system.
- The plan outlines priority interventions in the following areas:
a) Epidemiological surveillance and rapid response to maintain and strengthen surveillance activities and investigative capacity;
b) Case diagnosis to maintain laboratories and train local staff in the use of these laboratories;
c) Medical management to deal with a possible case, strengthen the local capacity in the long term, and make the medical and psychological follow-up of the survivors;
d) Prevention and control of infections to reinforce compliance with the rules of water, hygiene, and sanitation in health facilities;
e) Risk communication and community engagement to ensure a better understanding of risks by the community;
f) Psychosocial support to maintain the psychological follow-up of the victims and their families;
g) Immunization to train Congolese vaccinators on good medical practices, train logisticians on cold chain management, and document the success of ring vaccination against Ebola;
h) Free healthcare in the 7 health zones of Equateur province will continue until December 2018.

[The plan of action is good, but it is unfortunate free healthcare will terminate December 2018. Is that when the other important actions will also end, such as training of vaccinators, risk communication, etc.? If the plan includes strengthening the local capacity in the long term, offering free healthcare would facilitate building capacity and should be maintained. - Mod.LK]

[2] Analysis: Outbreak response
Date: Mon 23 Jul 2018

Although the 9th Ebola outbreak began in a remote area of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), there was a real danger that large numbers could be infected. It appeared close to neighbouring Central African Republic and the Republic of Congo, a vast area with a great ebb and flow of people and a fragile health system. It is also an area linked by river and road to the capital Kinshasa, home to 10 million people.

The vaccine used, known as rVSV-ZEBOV, was already in development during the 2014-16 epidemic. But by the time its effectiveness had been proven, the outbreak was already waning.
When the virus returned in 2018, it could be quickly deployed, once the DRC government had approved its experimental use. This vaccine is designed for use against the Zaire strain of Ebola, which caused both this outbreak and the previous one.

Scientists and health workers set to work tracking all potential transmissions since the 1st case had been reported. Front-line health workers, people in contact with confirmed Ebola cases, and their contacts all needed to be given the vaccine. However, keeping the vaccine safe and making sure it reached the right people was not a straightforward task. The vaccine must be kept extremely cold, at -70 deg C [-94 deg F]. This is difficult and expensive to do in a remote environment with unreliable electricity. Alongside the vaccine, refrigerators and generators had to be flown into the region by helicopter. Isolation and treatment facilities had to be built, mobile laboratories set up, and local laboratory technicians trained to test samples and confirm cases of Ebola.

For the vaccine to be effective, it had to be given to the right people. Health workers spoke to patients, their families, and the wider community to dispel rumours, build trust, and avoid panic. This, they explained to community leaders, was not a mass campaign.

Vaccinations were given to the Ebola patient, plus a "ring" of friends, family, and contacts as well as healthcare workers and people involved in burials. All had to give their consent. Identifying and finding all the people that suspected Ebola patients had been in contact with was a major challenge because of the location. Health workers had to travel by motorbike to places where there are no paved roads. Despite of these challenges, there has been a high uptake rate, and an estimated 98 percent of those eligible were vaccinated.

While the vaccination may have helped to save lives, better public-health measures also played a crucial role in containing the outbreak. Treatment centres and isolation zones were set up to reduce the spread of the virus, and face masks, gowns, and gloves were used. Safe burial practices also helped to limit transmission of the virus, as did screening of passengers at international and domestic ports and airports.

There has also been efforts to reintegrate survivors with their community, because in former outbreaks, survivors were sometimes ostracised by their families and neighbours.

In the 3 months since the outbreak began, more than 3000 people in the region have been vaccinated. As a result of the vaccine's use and the other precautionary measures, the epidemic is likely to end quicker than might have been expected.

But unfortunately, this isn't the end of the road for Ebola, as we know it is a disease that will continue to appear in future. Two years after it was first tested, the vaccine still works, but we don't yet know how long-lasting the protection will be. More than one Ebola vaccine is needed so we're not reliant on just one manufacturer.

It would also be helpful to have options for different situations, such as a single-shot vaccine for quick protection and booster vaccines when there isn't an outbreak.

Researchers need to find out more about what works and why, so more lives can be saved. To do that, we need to stop thinking of these outbreaks as isolated events and introduce a long-term programme of research and response into every Ebola outbreak.

And while Ebola is high profile, we also need to remember it isn't the only disease that could lead to an epidemic. DRC is facing a worrying outbreak of polio that has paralysed 29 children, and there are outbreaks of Lassa fever in Nigeria and the Nipah virus in India.

It's impossible to predict what the next epidemic will be, but we can be better prepared. At-risk countries need tools and support to strengthen their health systems and monitor disease so that they are ready before an outbreak and can save as many lives as possible.

[This analysis of the outbreak response brings up important points. The vaccine, which appears to have been critical to control the outbreak so quickly, must be maintained at -70 deg C [-94 deg F]. It would be an improvement to have a vaccine that can be maintained at ambient temperature. Furthermore, since it is not known how long protection lasts, a booster vaccine would be good to protect those already vaccinated should a new outbreak occur, which is highly likely. The persistence of the virus in women and not only men as previously demonstrated -- see report below -- presents a high risk of new cases flaring up into clusters of cases. Only a strong health infrastructure and constant surveillance will be able to detect these small clusters before they expand into larger outbreaks. - Mod.LK]

[ref: Dokubo EK, Wendland A, Mate SE, et al. Persistence of Ebola virus after the end of widespread transmission in Liberia: an outbreak report. Lancet Infect Dis. 2018]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Background. Outbreak response efforts for the 2014-2015 EVD epidemic in West Africa brought widespread transmission to an end. However, subsequent clusters of infection have occurred in the region. An EVD cluster in Liberia in November 2015 that was identified after a 15-year-old boy tested positive for an Ebola virus infection in Monrovia raised the possibility of transmission from a persistently infected individual.

Methods. Case investigations were done to ascertain previous contact with cases of EVD or infection with an ebolavirus. Molecular investigations on blood samples explored a potential linkage between Ebola virus isolated from cases in this November 2015 cluster and epidemiologically linked cases from the 2014-2015 West African outbreak, according to the national case database.

Findings. The cluster investigated was the family of the index case: the mother, father, and 3 siblings. Ebola virus genomes assembled from 2 cases in the November 2015 cluster and an epidemiologically linked EVD case in July 2014 were phylogenetically related within the LB5 sublineage that circulated in Liberia starting around August 2014. Partial genomes from 2 additional individuals, one from each cluster, were also consistent with placement in the LB5 sublineage. Sequencing data indicate infection with a lineage of the virus from a former transmission chain in the country. Based on serology and epidemiological and genomic data, the most plausible scenario is that a female case in the November 2015 cluster survived EVD in 2014, had viral persistence or recurrent disease, and transmitted the virus to 3 family members a year later.

Interpretation. Investigation of the source of infection for the November 2015 cluster provides evidence of Ebola virus persistence and highlights the risk for outbreaks after interruption of active transmission. These findings underscore the need for focused prevention efforts among survivors and sustained capacity to rapidly detect and respond to new EVD cases to prevent recurrence of a widespread outbreak.

"Health officials expected to declare Ebola outbreak over

The world's latest bout with Ebola is over. Today marks the 42nd day since the last case tested negative for the virus in the DRC. An official declaration is slated for tomorrow. There were a total of 53 cases, including 29 deaths. But a new paper raises concerns about survivors of this Ebola outbreak and others. Researchers investigated a mysterious cluster of cases -- 2 brothers and their father -- recorded in Liberia in late 2015, after transmission from a past outbreak was declared over.

By comparing the viral genomes to ones from earlier in the outbreak, the researchers figured out that the boys' mother had been infected more than a year earlier and was still carrying the virus. She'd never been diagnosed. Viral persistence has been seen before, but up until now, most transmission has been from men to women through semen. The authors say survivors can trigger resurgence of Ebola's spread in some cases, which experts warn could increase the substantial stigma that Ebola survivors can face."

[Byline: Megan Thielking]

This report is an eye-opener and of utmost importance in decision-making following the professed end of an Ebola outbreak. Finding resurgence of infectious virus in an asymptomatic individual 13 months after initial infection is of great concern. It suggests that the vaccination program needs to be expanded to include all those with prior infections, but possibly only women of childbearing age, since pregnancy very well may have been the trigger to reactivate the virus. It also highlights the importance of a strong healthcare system and active surveillance even in the absence of an outbreak. - Mod.LK]

Special Communication from HE Dr. Oly Ilunga Kalenga, Minister of Health, on the End of Ebola Virus Disease in the Province of Equateur

Dear Compatriots,

On [Tue 8 May 2018], I announced to the national and international opinion that the Democratic Republic of Congo was facing its 9th epidemic of the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD), which appeared in the Province of Equateur. This epidemic had all the characteristics of an unprecedented major crisis:
1) It started in 2 health zones at the same time, namely those of Bikoro and Iboko;
2) Caregivers also affected were an amplification factor;
3) The 2 affected health areas were located about 150 km [93 mi] from the town of Mbandaka, capital of Equateur Province.

From the start, we had prepared for the worst of scenarios. And our fears were quickly confirmed with the confirmation on Wed 16 May 2018 of the 1st cases of Ebola in the city of Mbandaka, specifically in the Wangata Health Zone.

Although the scale of the crisis we were facing was unprecedented, the speed and effectiveness of the response put in place by the government and its partners were also exceptional. The strengths of this response are as follows:
- The excellent collaboration of all actors involved under the leadership of the government;
- Deployment in less than 24 hours from Kinshasa of a rapid response team from the Ministry of Health;
- The installation in less than 48 hours of an air bridge between Kinshasa, Mbandaka, and Bikoro, thanks to the United Nations system;
- The administration for the 1st time, to 3300 people, of the vaccine against Ebola in order to break the chain of transmission in the community;
- Deployment and installation of 3 mobile laboratories of the INRB in Mbandaka, Bikoro, and Itipo to facilitate the rapid confirmation of cases; and
- The introduction of free healthcare in 7 health zones of the province, covering a population of nearly one million inhabitants.

This team work allowed for many challenges and quickly paid off.

Since [Wed 6 Jun 2018], no new confirmed cases of EVD have been recorded in the Province of Equateur. The last confirmed case of Ebola was cured from Bikoro Ebola Treatment Center on [Tue 12 Jun 2018].

Also, after a 42-day observation period, with no new confirmed cases recorded, and in accordance with international health regulations, I declare from this day, [Tue 24 Jul 2018], the end of the EVD epidemic in the Equateur Province, in the DRC.

In total, after verification and consolidation of the databases, the National Coordination counted 54 cases, including 33 deaths and 21 survivors, who regrouped within the National Association of Ebola Winners.

Dear Compatriots,

At the outbreak of the outbreak, His Excellency Mr. Joseph Kabila Kabange, President of the Republic and Head of State, requested that the response be fast, energetic, and effective, because every life counts. This mission is now accomplished.

This result would not have been possible without the dedication and professionalism of the Congolese health-care providers who gave the best of themselves to serve the nation and make life triumph. I want to express our gratitude to them.

I would also like to thank our friends and partners who worked closely with our experts and who have spontaneously aligned themselves with the government's priorities. Beyond the response to the epidemic, this unprecedented alignment of all stakeholders is the only way that will allow us to achieve our sole objective, namely to improve the health and well-being of the Congolese population.

It is therefore in this dynamic of alignment of all the actors behind the government that we begin today the post-epidemic phases, which include the stabilization of the situation, the resilience of the system in the affected and impacted health zones by this 9th epidemic, and the strengthening at the national level of our system of surveillance, detection, and response.

Thank you.

Dr. Oly Ilunga Kalenga

This [Tue 24 Jul 2018] marks the 42nd day after the last confirmed case of Ebola came out of the Ebola treatment center on [Tue 12 Jun 2018].

Thus, in accordance with international health regulations, the 9th Ebola epidemic in the DRC officially comes to an end

Epidemiological situation
--------------------------
From 20-21 Jul 2018, the Ministry of Health and the partners involved in the response organized a data reconciliation workshop to verify and correct data on the EVD epidemic in the province of Equateur.

After a case-by-case review of the data collected since the beginning of the epidemic, the final data validated are as follows:
- A total of 54 cases of haemorrhagic fever were reported in the region, of which 38 confirmed Ebola and 16 were probable.
- 33 deaths were recorded, including 17 confirmed cases.
- Thus, 21 people were cured of EVD.

[5] Risk following outbreak
Date: Tue 24 Jul 2018 1923 GMT
Source: CNN [edited]
https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/24/health/ebola-outbreak-congo-ends-bn/index.html


The Ministry of Health in the DRC officially declared on [Tue 24 Jul 2018] that the country's battle against a ravaging Ebola outbreak has come to an end, according to the World Health Organization.

The government of Congo declared an outbreak of Ebola hemorrhagic fever in May [2018], the country's 9th recorded outbreak. According to the Ministry of Health, 54 cases of Ebola virus were recorded during the outbreak, including 33 deaths.

The organization provided guidance to the ministry to declare the outbreak over if no other cases were confirmed and 2 full incubation periods of 21 days each have passed, starting the day after the last Ebola patient was released from care, WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic wrote in an email last week.

The last patient was released after blood-testing negative for the Ebola virus on [Tue 12 Jun 2018].

"DRC beat this outbreak of Ebola through traditional methods such as case investigation, contact tracing, and providing care to the sick, and with new tools such as vaccinating people who were at risk of being infected by the virus," Jasarevic said. "The government was speedy and transparent, and welcomed support where needed. These were key to an effective response."

WHO officials originally thought the recent outbreak would remain within Congo's isolated rural communities and not spread to more densely populated towns, which was the case in previous outbreaks, said Dr. Peter Salama, a medical epidemiologist and deputy director-general of emergency preparedness and response at WHO. "Then, in the 1st few days, cases were confirmed in the urban center of Mbandaka with more than a million people. That meant that we quickly had to change strategy," he said.

He added that, as the outbreak grew, the risk was massive to Kinshasa, the capital of DRC, as well as major cities in surrounding countries. The fast spread of the outbreak to a big city was a move that has become more common in recent years among various infectious diseases, Salama pointed out. "Perhaps because of climate change, because of changes in reservoir animals or vectors, and because of human encroachment on animal populations, we're seeing more and more urban outbreaks of these kinds of high-threat pathogens, and that poses a very different set of risks," he added.

As for Ebola, scientists think people are initially infected with Ebola virus through contact with an infected animal, such as a bat, and then the virus spreads from person to person. Ebola can only spread between humans by direct contact with an infected person's bodily fluids, such as urine, saliva, sweat, feces, vomit, breast milk, and semen.

"In urban areas, the chances of what we call a super-spreading event -- an event where one case can trigger literally 10s or 100s of cases -- is higher just because of the density of population," Salama said. "Therefore, these diseases become even more deadly and even more risky in urban circumstances, and that's something we've seen now with Ebola this time around."

Within hours of the Ebola outbreak being declared in Congo, WHO released USD 2 million from its contingency fund for emergencies to support response efforts, deployed a team, and activated an emergency incident management system.

With additional support from many other organizations -- including the United Nations, the World Food Programme, USAID, the Wellcome Trust, the World Bank and several countries -- more funding toward the Ebola response was provided to WHO. Hundreds of health workers and supplies were shipped in and out of the affected areas.

To fight the outbreak, health workers turned to not only traditional approaches but also new tools, such as an experimental vaccines and investigational drugs.

"We had a vaccine, and that, I think, is going to be extremely important for the future of Ebola control," Salama said. "In addition, although we didn't get to use them this time, we had under investigational protocol the potential to use 4 drugs. So for people already infected with Ebola, we had drugs onsite and able to be used by the end of the outbreak," he said. "It's not enough to do traditional public-health containment measures. We really feel that the same kinds of vaccines and drugs that we would offer to patients in the West should be offered to people in developing countries as well."

During the outbreak, at least 3300 people were vaccinated with an investigational Ebola vaccine from the pharmaceutical company Merck, called rVSV-ZEBOV, according to WHO.

"One thing that's different this time that I think really made a big difference is the availability of the vaccine from Merck," said Don Sodora, a virologist at the Center for Infectious Disease Research, which recently announced joining Seattle Children's Research Institute. The combined scientific team will form the largest pediatric infectious disease research program in the USA.

"It's still being tested," Sodora said of the vaccine. "Merck is still trying to figure out how efficacious it is, but it can really provide an opportunity where you can start protecting people."

Among those eligible to receive the vaccine were health-care and front-line workers, as well as the contacts -- and even the contacts of contacts -- of confirmed EVD patients, dead or alive.

Healthcare workers administered the vaccine using the ring strategy: the vaccine was administered to groups of people who were in close contact with each Ebola case, such as family members or caregivers, as well as the contacts of those contacts.

Health workers also followed up with and tracked the health of those in close contact with people who either had Ebola virus disease or died from the disease. The process was called contact tracing, which helps prevent further spread of the virus.

"In the typical ways to contain these types of outbreaks, you want to identify the patients very quickly. You want to make sure that people who are feverish and have the disease do not leave an area," Sodora said.

"The hemorrhagic fever viruses have a number of issues that make them particularly problematic with regard to transmission. They have this initial period when people are infected but don't show symptoms, and that's a problem," he said, adding that once people are infected, they are extremely contagious. "So the best strategy is to identify infected people, get there rapidly with trained health-care workers, and get quarantine established quickly. That is the major lesson we have learned."

There is still much left to learn about the Ebola virus and how long the risk might continue. A study published [Mon 23 Jul 2018] in the journal The Lancet Infectious Diseases found that about a year after a woman in Liberia survived an Ebola infection, she passed the virus to one or more of her family members, leading to the death of her 15-year-old son.

This cluster of cases suggests that, on rare occasions, Ebola virus can persist in a person long after that person recovered from acute infection. The study also is the 1st, to the authors' knowledge, to provide suggestive evidence of Ebola virus transmission from a female survivor after such a long period of time.

Such transmissions "are rare but underscore the need for continued prevention and disease surveillance," said Dr. Emily Kainne Dokubo, a researcher at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and lead author of the study. "Risk factors for Ebola virus persistence in body fluids are unknown, and the length of time that the virus persists in some survivors is varied," she said.

The woman's teen son tested positive for the virus in November 2015 after showing symptoms. The researchers collected specimens from the family members and tested blood samples.

The woman's husband and their 8-year-old son also tested positive. Their 2 youngest sons, 5 years old and 2 months old, tested negative. The woman herself also tested negative but had Ebola antibodies, indicating prior infection.

The researchers discovered that the woman must have been infected with the virus after she cared for her sick brother, who died of Ebola virus disease in 2014.

After caring for him, she reportedly became very ill with symptoms consistent with EVD, but she did not seek care. In September 2015, she gave birth to her youngest son and fell ill after delivery.

The researchers noted that the disease could have re-emerged because pregnancy and birth could have altered the woman's immune defenses. "The mother's infection may have flared up after her pregnancy, and the virus was then transmitted to other family members," Dokubo said.

The woman also could have transferred protective antibodies to her newborn son, which is why he didn't test positive for the virus. Meanwhile, she probably transmitted the virus to her husband, who in turn transmitted it to their oldest sons.

"The findings from this and recent EVD clusters highlight the risk of EVD flare-ups even after an outbreak is declared over," the researchers wrote.

During the Ebola outbreak in West Africa between 2014 and 2016, the largest in history, scientists learned about how the virus could persist in certain sites across the body, including eye fluids, the central nervous system, and semen, and it wouldn't be surprising even in a woman's placenta, said Dr. Colleen Kraft, associate professor of infectious diseases at Emory School of Medicine in Atlanta, who was not involved in the new study. "We already know that this persistence has led to occasional transmissions," Kraft said. "Women who become pregnant after having been exposed or recovered from Ebola virus disease will need to be closely monitored clinically for relapse."

In responding to this year's outbreak in Congo, the world seemed to be better prepared, especially in comparison with the previous outbreak in West Africa.

"One of the many painful lessons from the devastating West African Ebola epidemic of 2014 was that the world expected much more from the World Health Organization than it was then able to deliver," WHO's Jasarevic said.

During that outbreak, 28 616 cases of EVD and 11 310 deaths were reported in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. An additional 36 cases and 15 deaths occurred when the outbreak spread outside those 3 countries, according to the CDC.

"Since then, we have dedicated ourselves to ensuring that the world is better prepared, not only for Ebola but for the many high-threat pathogens, including pandemic influenza, that can cross the species barrier, from animals to humans, at any moment," Jasarevic said. As of now, WHO and other global health organizations are ensuring the end of the Ebola response in Congo and maintaining an increased vigilance to identify lessons learned and good practices in responding to such outbreaks moving forward. "Already, we can say we have contributed to improving surveillance systems and, for next time, will have in place protocols for vaccines and therapeutics," Jasarevic said. "Another legacy is capacity building, such as training vaccinators who will now not only be able to respond domestically but can also help neighboring countries too."

[6] Pan-ebolavirus antibody

https://www.cell.com/immunity/fulltext/S1074-7613(18)30300-5


Citation: P Gilchuk et al. Multifunctional Pan-ebolavirus Antibody Recognizes a Site of Broad Vulnerability on the Ebolavirus Glycoprotein. Immunity. Published Online: 17 Jul 2018. DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.immuni.2018.06.018

Highlights
- Broad human antibody recognizes a quaternary site of vulnerability on ebolavirus GP.
- The antibody possesses pan-ebolavirus neutralizing and protective capacity.
- The antibody mediates protection principally by direct virus neutralization.
- The antibody uses several mechanisms for contributing to broad immunity.

Summary. Ebolaviruses cause severe disease in humans, and identification of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that are effective against multiple ebolaviruses are important for therapeutics development. Here we describe a distinct class of broadly neutralizing human mAbs with protective capacity against 3 ebolaviruses infectious for humans: Ebola (EBOV), _Sudan_ (SUDV), and _Bundibugyo_ (BDBV) viruses. We isolated mAbs from human survivors of ebolavirus disease and identified a potent mAb, EBOV-520, which bound to an epitope in the glycoprotein (GP) base region. EBOV-520 efficiently neutralized EBOV, BDBV, and SUDV and also showed protective capacity in relevant animal models of these infections. EBOV-520 mediated protection principally by direct virus neutralization and exhibited multifunctional properties. This study identified a potent naturally occurring mAb and defined key features of the human antibody response that may contribute to broad protection. This multifunctional mAb and related clones are promising candidates for development as broadly protective pan-ebolavirus therapeutic molecules.

Discussion. Here we describe potent pan-ebolavirus reactive human mAbs. The work demonstrates several principles of broad protection. 1st, the studies identify unique binding sites for base region human mAbs that confer broad and potent activity against EBOV, BDBV, and SUDV, including engagement of a quaternary epitope spanning GP1 and GP2 subunits. 2nd, the work identifies bNAbs that mediate protection as monotherapy in vivo solely by neutralizing activity, including by a naturally occurring IgG4 antibody. 3rd, the EBOV-520 that binds to the GP base region reduces GP binding to the soluble NPC1-C, by an allosteric effect. 4th, we describe pan-Ebolavirus glycan cap-specific mAbs that "prime" the GP to enhance accessibility of the deep base region site of vulnerability, establishing a rational principle for development of broad mAb cocktails for Ebolavirus prevention or therapy.
