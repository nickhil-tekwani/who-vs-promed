Chinese scientists sounded the alarm on Wednesday [5 Feb 2014] after a new bird flu [avian influenza] virus, H10N8, killed an elderly woman in December [2013] and infected another individual last month [January 2014]. The 5th novel influenza strain to emerge in 17 years, the virus has a worrying genetic profile and should be closely monitored, they reported in The Lancet medical journal [Avian influenza A H10N8 -- a virus on the verge? http://download.thelancet.com/flatcontentassets/pdfs/S014067361460163X.pdf]. It appears to be able to infect tissue deep in the lung and may have features allowing it to spread efficiently among humans, they said.

"The pandemic potential of this novel virus should not be underestimated," said the team headed by Shu Yuelong from the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Beijing. The warning stems from analysis of a virus sample taken from a 73 year old woman who died in Nanchang, in south eastern Jiangxi province, on [6 Dec 2013] after being diagnosed with severe pneumonia and respiratory failure. Although the cases are few, the fact it has jumped from birds to humans is an important warning, the researchers said. "We should always be worried when viruses cross the species barrier from birds or animals to humans, as it is very unlikely that we will have prior immunity to protect us," said Jeremy Farrar, director of Wellcome Trust and an expert on flu. "We should be especially worried when those viruses show characteristics that suggest they have the capacity to replicate easily or to be virulent or resistant to drugs. This virus ticks several of these boxes and therefore is a cause for concern."

The Chinese authorities announced her death from H10N8 on [18 Dec 2013]. The Lancet study disclosed that a 2nd case of H10N8 was recorded in Nanchang, on [26 Jan 2014]. It did not give further details. [See ProMED-mail post "Avian influenza, human (36): China (JX) H10N8 20140126.2233164"] They are the 1st known human cases of H10N8, a virus that has been found only 2 times before in China -- once in a water sample from a lake in Hunan in 2007, and the 2nd time in live poultry in Guangdong province in 2012. But this particular strain is different from the ones found in those 2 samples, the study said.

The big contributors to its genome are reshuffled genes -- or a process called genetic reassortment -- from the H9N2 virus, the authors said. Somewhat worryingly, the virus -- like H7N9 -- has also evolved "some genetic characteristics that may allow it to replicate efficiently in humans", the CDC's Shu. This [H9N2 virus] is a bird virus that erupted in Hong Kong in 1999 and has also contributed to the dangerous H5N1 and H7N9 flu viruses, according to the investigation. Avian flu viruses pass from infected birds to humans in close proximity but typically do not transmit easily between humans. The worry for health watchdogs is their potential to acquire an ability to jump easily from person to person.

H7N9, which emerged last year [2013], has led to 159 human infections in China, including 71 deaths, according to a combined toll of official figures and a tally of reports by local authorities. H5N1, which first occurred among humans in Hong Kong in 1997, has caused 648 infections with 384 deaths since 2003, according to figures cited in The Lancet study. The genome of H10N8, it said, pointed to a mutation in its so-called PB2 protein that, previous research has found, suggests an ability to adapt to mammals. The virus also has a mutation in its haemagglutinin protein -- a spike on the virus surface that enables it to latch onto other cells -- that suggests it can infect deep in the lung, like H5N1, rather than the upper respiratory tract, the trachea.

Lab tests on the sample showed it could be attacked by Tamiflu, the frontline anti-viral drug. Many questions remain, including how the woman was infected. She had bought a live chicken at a poultry market several days before falling sick. But she may have become infected beforehand, the scientists said. She did not handle the bird and no virus traces were found in poultry at the market.

According to the scientists' study of her case, the 73 year old victim was admitted to hospital with fever and severe pneumonia on [30 Nov 2013]. Despite being treated with antibiotics and antivirals, she deteriorated rapidly, developed multiple organ failure and died 9 days after her symptoms first started. In addition, the woman may have been an easy target for the virus because of poor health. She had coronary heart disease, high blood pressure, and a muscle-weakening disease called myasthenia gravis. Tests on people who had been in close contact with her concluded that no one else had been infected.

The 2nd case of H10N8 "is of great concern", said co-author Mingbin Liu of the Nanchang branch of China's CDC. "It reveals that the H10N8 virus has continued to circulate and may cause more human infections in the future." Mingbin Liu, from Nanchang's disease control bureau, added that the emergence of a 2nd human case of H10N8 in a 55 year old woman was "of great concern because it reveals that the H10N8 virus has continued to circulate and may cause more human infections in future".

John McCauley, head of the WHO Collaborating Centre for Influenza at Britain's National Institute for Medical Research said the emergence of H10N8, and of H7N9 "reminds us to be aware of human infections from animal influenza viruses. Previously we did not think that H7N9 infections might be so lethal. Now we also must consider H10N8 infections as well," he said. He added, however, that the risk of this virus spreading from person to person "seems low since the H10N8 virus is not expected to be transmitted well between humans."

Other flu experts not directly involved in the study on H10N8 agreed it was an important reminder of the potential threat from circulating and mutating flu viruses, but said it did not appear to be a particular concern for the moment. Ben Neuman, a virologist at Britain's University of Reading said while the fatal H10N8 case needed to be watched closely, "there is no cause for alarm at this time."

Chinese scientists report 1st human death linked to new bird flu virus
----------------------------------------------------------------
Tests on tracheal swab samples established that the virus was a new genetic reassortment avian-origin H10N8 virus (JX346). Whole genome sequencing indicated that all the genes of the virus were of avian origin, with 6 internal genes derived from avian H9N2 viruses that are circulating in poultry in China. "A genetic analysis of the H10N8 virus shows a virus that is distinct from previously reported H10N8 viruses having evolved some genetic characteristics that may allow it to replicate efficiently in humans. Notably, H9N2 virus provided the internal genes not only for the H10N8 virus, but also for H7N9 and H5N1 viruses," explains author Dr Yuelong Shu from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing.* The woman, from Nanchang City in China, presented to hospital with fever and severe pneumonia on [30 Nov 2013]. Despite antibiotic and antiviral treatment she deteriorated rapidly, developed multiple organ failure, and died 9 days after illness onset.

"The results suggested that JX346 might originate from multiple reassortments between different avian influenza viruses. The H10 and H8 gene segments might have derived from different wild bird influenza viruses reassorted to give rise to a hypothetical H10N8 virus in wild birds, which infected poultry and then reassorted with H9N2 viruses in poultry to give rise to the novel reassortant JX346 (H10N8) virus," said Dr Shu. "Importantly, the virus had a mutation in the PB2 gene that is believed to be associated with increased virulence and adaption in mammals, and could enable the virus to become more infectious to people," explains co-investigator Dr Qi Jin from the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College in Beijing.*

Further investigation revealed the women had visited a live poultry market a few days prior to infection, suggesting the incubation time was about 4 days, similar to other avian influenza virus infections. However, no H10N8 virus was found in samples collected from the poultry site the patient visited, and the source of the infection remains unknown. The H10N8 strain was previously isolated from a water sample taken from China's Dongting Lake in Hunan Province in 2007, and detected at a live poultry market in Guangdong province in 2012. But human infection with an N8 subtype has never been reported before. Co-author Dr Mingbin Liu from Nanchang City Center for Disease Control and Prevention concludes by warning that that the pandemic potential of this novel virus should not be underestimated, "A 2nd case of H10N8 was identified in Jiangxi Province, China on [26 Jan 2014]. This is of great concern because it reveals that the H10N8 virus has continued to circulate and may cause more human infections in future."*

[Chinese scientists have reported that the 1st human infection with an H10N8 avian influenza virus involved a new strain that carries genes from H9N2 viruses and has a mutation associated with adaptation to mammals. Writing in the Lancet, they detailed the results of their genomic analysis of this virus, which was isolated from a 73 year old Chinese woman who died on 6 Dec 2013. Her illness was the first known human case involving that strain.

A 2nd human case in China was reported by the country's government news agency on 27 Jan 2014. "The pandemic potential of this novel virus should not be underestimated," the Lancet authors warn [Chen H, Yuan H, Gao R, et al. Clinical and epidemiological characteristics of a fatal case of avian influenza A H10N8 virus infection: a descriptive study. Lancet 2014 published online 4 Feb 2014; http://download.thelancet.com/flatcontentassets/pdfs/S014067361460163X.pdf].

The study reports that the genes for all 6 of the virus's internal proteins were derived from H9N2 viruses, which circulate in poultry and occasionally infect humans in China, usually causing a mild illness. The H9N2 viruses also provided the internal protein genes for the H7N9 virus, which has caused scores of deaths in China since last spring [2013], and the H5N1 virus, which has killed more than 380 people since 2003.

The woman who had the 1st H10N8 infection lived in Nanchang, the capital of Jiangxi province (also the home of the 2nd case-patient), and had hypertension, coronary heart disease, and myasthenia gravis, the report says. She fell ill with a cough on 27 Nov 2013 and became feverish 2 days later. On 30 Nov 2013 she was hospitalized with fever and severe pneumonia. Despite antibiotic and antiviral treatment, mechanical ventilation, and other measures, she died 9 days after her 1st symptoms. The authors established that that tracheal samples from the patient were positive for H10N8 and negative for seasonal flu viruses, H5N1, H7N9, and H9N2. The authors of the paper observe that no poultry outbreak of H10N8 has been reported and that the virus's apparent low pathogenicity in poultry could help it circulate undetected, as is true of H7N9. They conclude that the 1st human infection with H10N8 "further increases the importance of surveillance for pandemic preparedness and response." - Mod.CP
