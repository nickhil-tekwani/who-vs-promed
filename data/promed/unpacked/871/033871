Today [24 Aug 2021] UNICEF published a piece in UN News concerning plague in Ituri Province, eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and the risks for young children. Izzy Scott Moncrieff, UNICEF Social Sciences Analytics Cell (CASS) Field Supervisor was quoted as saying, "The really worrying thing here is that we've got plague reported in areas which had not seen a case for more than 15 years, and many more cases in areas where they had very few or none previously."

According to WHO, from epidemiological week 1 to 25, 2021 (ending on 27 Jun 2021), 117 suspected plague cases including 13 deaths were reported in 8 health zones in Ituri Province. From January to December 2020, 461 suspected plague cases including 31 deaths were reported in 8 health zones of Ituri. The health zones of Biringi, Rethy, and Aru reported the most cases. This includes bubonic and pneumonic plague cases.

Poor sanitation, poverty, conflict and displacement contribute to the resurgence of plague in the area and the increased risk for children, and UNICEF notes outbreaks are often blamed on poor sanitation and hygiene practices which attract rats carrying fleas, searching for food, who infect people in their homes.

Plague is mostly transmitted in rural areas by fleasâ€¯carried by wild rats. Poorer families can be particularly affected. A lack of resources, which forces many people to sleep on floors because they do not have beds, unsafe funeral practices, poor waste disposal, and seeking medical care through traditional methods rather than recognized health centers also aggravate matters.

As Moncrieff notes: "There are grave consequences for children because they are more exposed to the risk factors of plague."

[Most cases are due to bubonic plague following the bite of an infected rodent flea, causing a swollen and very tender lymph gland. The swollen gland is called a bubo. Bubonic plague should be suspected when a person develops a swollen gland, fever, chills, headache, and extreme exhaustion and has a history of possible exposure to infected rodents, rabbits, or fleas. A person usually becomes ill with bubonic plague 2-6 days after being bitten.

When bubonic plague is left untreated, plague bacteria invade the bloodstream. The bacteremia can also occur as an initial event. As the plague bacteria multiply in the bloodstream, they spread rapidly throughout the body and cause a severe and often fatal condition. Infection of the lungs with the plague bacterium causes the pneumonic form of plague, a severe respiratory illness. The infected person may experience high fever, chills, cough, and breathing difficulty and may expel bloody sputum. If plague patients are not given specific antimicrobial therapy, the disease can progress rapidly to death. It is the pneumonic form of infection that can spread by the airborne route. - Mod.LL
