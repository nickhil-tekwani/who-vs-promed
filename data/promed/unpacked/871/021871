Football officials, referees, and players who slept with Masaka
prostitutes are in panic over a deadly sexually transmitted
disease, Nkumunye. They are attending the Celtel sponsored
Buganda Mini-League.
Health officials in Rakai, Kalangala and Masaka confirmed the
reports, saying Nkumunye was brought into Rakai by prostitutes
from Bukoba in Tanzania. The Medical officer in Kalangala district,
Dr. Deus Kahuruza said Nkumunye is a deadly STD [sexually
transmitted diseases] which starts with genital sores which deepen
and eventually destroy the entire reproductive organs if not
treated early.
Police in Kalisizo have so far rounded up 10 Tanzanians and plans are
underway to arrest at least 100 others who stay in Rakai illegally. The
Rakai police officer Denis Sebugwawo confirmed arrests and said most
Tanzanian women, including prostitutes operating in Rakai and Kyotera
town are on the run.

A somewhat bizarre story. Does anyone know what Nkumunye is?
Chancroid?

disease after the severe weight loss it causes - Mod.JW]
