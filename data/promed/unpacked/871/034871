Medical sources at Wad Madani City hospital in El Gezira state, have reported 19 deaths due to haemorrhagic fever over the past 2 weeks. Speaking to Radio Dabanga, the source said that about 11 infected people have been quarantined in the hospital.

The health authorities have been keeping a tight lid on the outbreak, and on Monday [17 Nov 2014], the State Ministry of Health issued instructions to the departments of rural hospitals to transfer all patients suffering any bleeding to hospitals in Wad Madani, Kamleen and Hassahiya.

Sources say the Federal Ministry of Health instructed the state health authorities not to talk about these fevers in order to preserve the country's exports of livestock. Doctors do not rule out the possibility that the infection of patients was caused by eating meat. The sources pointed out that on Monday [17 Nov 2014], the Ministry of health of El Gezira instructed the rural hospitals to notify the Ministry of any new cases of the disease and transfer any patient suffering from bleeding to major hospitals in the state.

[The outbreak continues to increase in case numbers and to spread geographically. On 24 Oct 2014, 4 cases of an undiagnosed hemorrhagic fever were reported (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20141028.2907268). The 5 Nov 2014 report indicated that there were 5 cases (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20141109.2940215), and a 11 Nov 2014 report indicated an increase to 25 cases (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20141111.2946812). The above report indicates 30 cases including 19 fatalities in a new state in the same general area of Sudan. Cases have now been reported from South Darfur, West and North Kordofan and, now El Gezira.

The stated possible association of the disease to the consumption of meat is not clear, nor is the concern about the occurrence of human disease having possible effects on livestock exportation. With this report as well as the previous ones, there are not enough details provided to make a definite diagnosis. One hopes that appropriate samples have been taken and sent to the laboratory for diagnosis. As noted in the previous post, a thorough laboratory study is needed for the cases above. ProMED-mail would appreciate receiving information about additional cases or results of any laboratory tests that become available.

Yellow fever (YF) virus infection is an obvious possibility, given that it has occurred in the region in the not too distant past. Rift Valley fever is another possibility, but there is no mention of small ruminant animals being affected in the area. Perhaps this is the basis for the concern about livestock exports? Between 3 Oct and 24 Nov 2013, a total of 44 confirmed cases of YF were reported, including 14 deaths. A total of 12 localities in West and South Kordofan were affected by that outbreak.
