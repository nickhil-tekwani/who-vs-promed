A rare brain-eating amoeba is responsible for at least 10 deaths in the Pakistani city of Karachi in recent months, health officials believe. People are being urged to use clean water at all times.

The source of the parasite is not yet known, but it is thought victims may have been exposed to it when using water to rinse their nasal passages. The amoeba, _Naegleria fowleri_, lives in warm water and kills its victims by destroying brain tissue. Officials are now increasing the amount of chlorine in the public water supply.

The deaths are in various locations across Karachi, Pakistan's biggest city. Dr Shakeel Mallick, who works for the provincial health department, said 9 of those killed were men, while one victim was a child of 4.

Officials suspect other cases may have gone undetected. Dr Mallick said hospitals were now being "vigilant". The ministry was "very concerned" about the amoeba," he said.

Although the amoeba is usually picked up in contaminated pools or lakes, only one of those killed had been swimming. Officials are, therefore, concentrating their attention on the possibility that people picked it up when cleaning out their nostrils, a practice which is common in South Asia, BBC regional analyst Jill McGivering said.

The amoebae travel to the brain through the nasal passages. Those infected have symptoms including fever, nausea and vomiting, as well as a stiff neck and headaches. Most die within a week.

The World Health Authority's [Organization's, I think - Mod.SH] Musa Khan says other cities across Pakistan have been put on alert. An awareness campaign has also been launched among health workers and the public. "People should avoid getting water too deep into their nostrils," Mr Khan said. "Those with symptoms should seek help immediately."

People are being advised to use boiled or chlorinated water to rinse their noses and to clean out domestic water tanks where amoebae may flourish. The amoebae cannot be passed from person to person.

[Primary amebic meningoencephalitis infection takes place when infected water enters the nasal cavity, and the amoeba enters the brain through the olfactory nerves.

More data are needed on the history of water contact to determine the risk factors for each individual patient. Drinking water has not be shown to be a risk. - Mod.EP
