New cases of hepatitis C have been reported at Alexander Maconochie Centre [AMC]. Hepatitis C cases are rising among ACT [Australian Capital Territory] jail inmates as prison guards remain opposed to a new push to start a needle-exchange program at Alexander Maconochie Centre. It has been almost 10 months since Chief Minister Katy Gallagher announced an Australian-first needle exchange at the prison as part of a plan to curb blood-borne disease. The issue, discussed in various forms since the jail's inception, has faced strident opposition from guards, who say it is unworkable and would jeopardise their safety.

The model would see inmates swap dirty needles for clean needles using safety containers, in a one-for-one exchange overseen by prison medical staff. Guards and prison workers have 6 weeks to respond to the plan, with ongoing consultation and "focus group" sessions offered in the meantime. Government officials said they left the meeting with "no doubt" that further changes were needed to win the support of the guards.

But as the protracted negotiations continue, more inmates have tested positive to hepatitis C. 2 new inmates are known to have acquired the disease inside the jail since March last year [2012], although that number may be higher due to the difficulty in determining "in-custody transmissions". There are a further 18 cases where the disease may have been transmitted inside the jail, but where "in-community transmission" has not been ruled out.

The Health Directorate said that developing the needle exchange was a "complex and sensitive process", and that it needed time to work through the range of issues associated with putting the proposal into a practical form. Health Directorate deputy director-general Stephen Goggs said there was a strong turnout at the meeting, and "frank and forthright participation" by guards. "It's fair to say that there is still a high level of concern from custodial officers. They're concerned obviously that any needles in the AMC pose a safety risk to them," Mr Goggs said. "They're also concerned that almost no model reduces the opportunity for detainees to share needles, so that's something we still need to work through. "I think we've still got quite a way to go, but they came up with very constructive and direct feedback."

The Community and Public Sector Union, which represents ACT prison guards, has maintained its opposition to the needle exchange plan since reacting angrily to the surprise announcement last year [2012]. Union regional director Vince McDevitt said initial reports from Monday's [3 Jun 2013] meeting suggested a number of "problematic issues" had not been addressed in the detailed model given to guards. "We will be meeting with our members and consolidating our collective response to the revised proposal next month [June 2013]," he said.

Mr McDevitt said the AMC was not the right place to trial a needle exchange, due to its layout, the difficulties in maintaining anonymity of heroin users, and the mixture of a broad range of prisoner types. The union took the issue to Fair Work Australia last August [2012], saying the government had breached a clause in the guards' enterprise agreement by failing to properly consult with them. That clause states "no needle exchange program ... shall be implemented without prior consultation and agreement by the directorate and union[s]".

The Health Directorate said it would be open to guards raising the issue of retaining that clause in the current enterprise agreement bargaining negotiations.

[Hepatitis C is a contagious liver disease that results from infection with hepatitis C virus. It can range in severity from a mild illness lasting a few weeks to a serious, lifelong illness. Hepatitis C virus is usually spread when blood from an infected person enters the body of a susceptible person. It is among the most common viruses that infect the liver. Hepatitis C virus is most commonly transmitted through exposure to infectious blood. This can occur through receipt of contaminated blood transfusions, blood products, and organ transplants; injections given with contaminated syringes and needle-stick injuries in health-care settings; injection drug use; being born to a hepatitis C-infected mother. Hepatitis C may be transmitted through sex with an infected person or sharing of personal items contaminated with infectious blood, but these are less common. Hepatitis C is not spread through breast milk, food, or water or by casual contact such as hugging, kissing, and sharing food or drinks with an infected person.

Hepatitis C does not always require treatment. There are 6 genotypes of hepatitis C and they may respond differently to treatment. Combination antiviral therapy with interferon and ribavirin has been the mainstay of hepatitis C treatment. Scientific advances have led to the development of new antiviral drugs for hepatitis C, which may be more effective and better tolerated than existing therapies. Recently 2 new therapeutic agents telaprevir and boceprevir have been licensed in some countries. Much needs to be done to ensure that these advances lead to greater access and treatment globally (see http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs164/en/index.html).

In view of the advancements in treatment of hepatitis C virus infection, it would seem more important to identify the prisoners with hepatitis C and offer specific treatment, rather than to introduce a needle-exchange programme that would be difficult to implement and might endanger the prison staff administering the scheme. One can easily understand the concern of the prison guards. It seems an ill-considered initiative. - Mod.CP
