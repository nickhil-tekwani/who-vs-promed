SARS in China: investigation continues, Update 6, 5 May 2004
-----------------------------------------------
Investigation of the source of the current outbreak -- 1st reported
on 22 Apr 2004 -- continues to focus on the National Institute of
Virology in Beijing. The institute is known to have conducted
experiments using the live SARS coronavirus during Feb and Mar 2004.
2 researchers at the institute developed SARS in late Mar and mid-Apr
2004. However, neither is known to have conducted research using the
live virus, suggesting some other source of infection within the
laboratory or, possibly, elsewhere.
Members of a joint WHO-Chinese investigative team, wearing full
personal protective equipment, entered the institute last Fri 30 Apr
and again yesterday [4 May 2004]. Initial findings indicate that the
investigation will be complex, as no single infectious source, or
single procedural error, appears likely to explain the infection in
the 2 researchers.
Continuing investigation is needed to determine the source of
infection and to ensure that conditions, equipment, and biosafety
procedures within the institute do not pose an ongoing risk of SARS
infection to lab personnel. A large number of samples from various
locations within the institute were taken by Chinese investigators.
These samples are also undergoing analysis at the WHO SARS laboratory
in Hong Kong.
WHO has strongly recommended that work using the live SARS virus be
conducted in biosafety level 3 facilities in order to minimize the
risk of laboratory-acquired infections. Further investigation of the
institute is needed to ensure that any work using the live virus
fully complies with the strict requirements for physical containment
of the virus: storage, administrative control, work procedures,
personal protection of laboratory workers, and, authorization and
monitoring of all staff admitted to the laboratory.
The National Institute of Virology was closed on 23 Apr 2004, and
most of its staff were quarantined for medical observation. However,
a small number of staff have remained within the facility to continue
essential experiments and to care for laboratory animals.

[We await further information on the results of the studies mentioned
above. In both of the prior 2 episodes of clinically apparent SARS
transmission (as a result of laboratory accidents), breaches in
standard laboratory procedures were identified as the probable
etiology of the infections. Perhaps the bigger issue arising from
these incidents is the quality control of laboratory safety
procedures at the international level. Human error is often the
ultimate culprit in these situations. - Mod.MPP]
