I was unaware that deer were susceptible to Blue Tongue. Here in Louisiana
we get EHD in mid-summer, sometimes with significant acute die-offs of deer,
and Blue Tongue in September. In colonial times EHD was confused with
anthrax. As they share some antigens, the former (EHDV) may protect deer
against the latter (BTV). When I was studying Blue Tongue about ten years
ago we found that it did not occur where there was salt water intrusion,
i.e. where ditch water might be brackish, though bayous (rivers) would
provide fingers of fresh ground water through otherwise brackish areas. I
think this was through selection of midge vector subspecies. As midges like
shitty water, we would find most viral activity around pig farms with
lagooned faeces. Blue tongue is one of those quiet but expensive infections
of cattle resulting in lost pregnancies, brain lesions in calves, and
certainly contributes to 'dummy calf syndrome' or inability to suckle in
Brahma and Brahma-cross calves. Our sentinel cattle would get a transitory
EHD infection in June/July with short-lived antibody titres but I never
heard of any clinical problems. Much still remains to be discovered about
these two orbiviruses.
