[This serotype, BTV-4, is different from the BTV-1 serotype which
began circulating in Algeria in August of 2009 and has just been
declared to be resolved on 3 Feb 2010. Interestingly, it appears just
as one virus strain leaves off in small ruminants, another one begins
to pick up in cattle. It will be interesting to see how long this new
one continues.

The location of the 2 outbreaks can be seen on the map attached to the
OIE WAHID notification. - Mod.PC]
