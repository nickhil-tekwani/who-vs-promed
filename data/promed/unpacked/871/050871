I was the veterinary epidemiologist in the national veterinary epidemiology
unit of Bolivia (UNIVEP) between January 1998 and December 2000; indeed I
coordinated the investigations of foot and mouth disease (FMD) in
Cochabamba and La Paz in 1999 mentioned in Foot & mouth disease - Bolivia
(02) [referenced above.
The outbreak in La Paz occurred in the municipal abattoir in the center of
La Paz and involved only pigs. The likely cause of this outbreak was
infection of pigs being kept in the [holding area by cattle [from in the
Beni (tropical lowlands), where FMD is endemic.
When we were monitoring FMD, the lowland part of Bolivia, where the vast
majority of the cattle population is, was the only FMD-endemic area from
the Beni in the north through Santa Cruz to the Chaco and the Argentinian
border in the south. With the export of cattle from this region there was
from time to time export of FMD. However, despite minimal attention to
outbreaks in the valleys (for example, Cochabamba) in 1999, and a low
coverage of vaccination, FMD was unable to sustain itself. Similarly, rare
outbreaks of FMD in the altiplano in the past have all been self limiting.
A serological survey in 1999 of La Paz and the cattle-rearing area of Oruro
(altiplano) showed no evidence of circulation of FMD virus in the cattle
population.
Camelids have never been deliberately included in a FMD vaccination program
in Bolivia. Indeed, only cattle are routinely vaccinated in FMD campaigns
throughout South America (pigs, sheep, and goats are not included in
routine campaigns). As to whether camelids are susceptible to FMD, the
definitive work was done on Plum Island and published (I cannot find my
copy after my move); llamas were successfully infected with FMD and showed
very mild clinical signs. They were also shown to be able to infect cattle.
This work was of course under experimental conditions.
In Bolivia, most of the camelids are in the drier eastern part of the
altiplano, where there are no cattle. [Conversely, there are no camelids
in the tropical lowlands, where most cattle are to be found, so there tends
to be a natural segregation of the 2 species in Bolivia. There never was
any evidence that camelids were important in the epidemiology of FMD in the
region. If cattle and llamas were to be kept on adjoining properties,
however, it is likely that llamas could become infected, as occurred under
experimental conditions.

In our experience over the years, [South American camelids have low
susceptibility to infection with FMDV, even by experimental exposure. For
more information see - J Vet Med B 1996; 42(10): 595-9; Vet Arg 1996;
12(119): 620-7; and J Vet Med B 1999; 46: 157-61.

[The actual field experience involving camelids is most interesting.
However, that fact that camelids have been affected by FMD is certainly
documented in the literature as well as in field cases. We are grateful for
the answers provided, but unless there are other issues related to a spread
of this outbreak or the direct involvement of camelids, this thread is cut.
