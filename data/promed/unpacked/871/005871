[Now that the incidence, in the UK, of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob
Disease -- abbreviated as CJD (new var.) or vCJD in ProMED-mail --
shows evidence of having peaked, or, at least of having reached a
plateau, the Department of Health's full table of definite, and
probable, CJD deaths and referrals will no longer be reproduced in
ProMED-mail. Only the monthly summary of variant CJD statistics will
be posted, unless there is a substantial change in the situation. The
full table, updated monthly, can be accessed at the Department of
Health web-site:
<http://www.dh.gov.uk/assetRoot/04/08/35/86/04083586.pdf>.
The precise definition of the terms deaths, definite cases, probable
vCJD cases, and, the case definitions can be found by accessing the
Department of Health web-site, or, by reference to a previous
ProMED-mail post in this thread (for example, CJD (new var.) - UK:
update Mar 2002 20020305.3693) - Mod.CP]
Monthly variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease statistics as of Mon 6 Sep 2004
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Department of Health is today [Mon 6 Sep 2004] issuing the latest
information about the numbers of known cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob
disease. This includes cases of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease
(vCJD), the form of the disease thought to be linked to BSE. The
position is as follows:
Definite and probable CJD cases in the UK:
Summary of vCJD cases - Deaths
------------------------------
Deaths from definite vCJD (confirmed): 104
Deaths from probable vCJD (without neuropathological confirmation): 38
Deaths from probable vCJD (neuropathological confirmation pending): 0
Total number of deaths from definite or probable vCJD (as above): 142
Summary of vCJD cases - Alive
-----------------------------
Number of probable vCJD cases still alive: 5
Total
-----
Number of definite or probable vCJD (dead and alive): 147
(The next update will be published on Mon 4 Oct 2004)

ProMED-mail
<promed@promedmail.org>
[These figures differ from those published on Tue 3 Aug 2004 for the
preceding month by the death of one of the surviving probable vCJD
cases. The overall total number of vCJD cases (dead and alive)
remains at 147. This is consistent with the inference that the vCJD
epidemic in the U.K. may have passed its peak. Only one new case of
vCJD has been confirmed during the past 7 months. This brings the
total number of new cases of vCJD during 2004 to 4, compared to 18
deaths during 2003, and, a peak of 28 deaths in the year 2000.
However, the identification of vCJD prions in the spleen of an
elderly blood transfusion recipient, who, unlike all previous cases,
was heterozygous at codon 129 of the PRNP gene (see: CJD (new var.) -
UK: update 2004 (08) 20040806.2150), introduces new uncertainties
into estimates of the possible course of the vCJD epidemic. - Mod.CP]

Patients to be alerted to variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease risk
----------------------------------------------------------------
Patients who received blood products from donors who subsequently
died from variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease [abbreviated as CJD (new
var.) or vCJD in ProMED-mail] are to be warned that they could be
carrying the brain wasting disease. The measures are being taken
after it emerged, last year [2003], that a patient had died following
a transfusion from someone with the human form of mad cow disease.
The case was thought to be the 1st person-to-person vCJD
transmission. Only patients who received blood products before 1999,
when new rules and procedures were introduced, are at risk.
Since 1997, all cases of vCJD that are reported to the National CJD
Surveillance Unit, and diagnosed as having "probable" vCJD, are
passed on to the National Blood Service, which searches its blood
donor records. If the patient has given blood, any stocks of that
blood are immediately destroyed. White blood cells, which it is
thought may carry the greatest risk of transmitting the disease, have
been removed from all blood used for transfusion since 1999. And,
blood products, such as clotting factors, have been prepared from
plasma imported from the US since 1998.
Health Secretary Dr. John Reid said that the new measures to prevent
the possible spread of vCJD would include an assessment of blood
products used before 1999, and, informing anyone who received blood
products from donors who later died of vCJD. He said: "Many more
patients of course, including hemophiliacs, will have received plasma
products before plasma was sourced from the US. They will have
received products derived from large pools of plasma donated from
many thousands of people and thus heavily diluted. The UK-wide CJD
Incidents Panel considers the risks for this group to be even lower
than for those who received whole blood.
It is very difficult to trace all individual recipients of products made from
these plasma pools. However, the CJD Incidents Panel will be advising, on a
case-by-case basis, which recipients will need to be contacted, as the
necessary information becomes available."
Patients will be informed in September 2004, after the Health
Protection Agency has carried out the risk assessment. It is
understood that letters will be sent urging each patient to contact a
specialist. But, the Department of Health expressed concern that the
results of the risk assessment exercise be communicated to patients
in a sensitive and appropriate manner directly by the doctors, and
other clinicians, who care for them. A spokesman added: "It would be
grossly unfair on the patients involved to discuss the results of the
risk assessment exercise in the media before patients are informed of
the outcome. A full public statement will be made at the appropriate
time."

Thousands may have contracted variant CJD through blood transfusion
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thousands of people who received blood products prior to 1999, are
to be warned that they may be incubating variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob
Disease [abbreviated as CJD (new var.) or vCJD in ProMED-mail], the
human form of mad cow disease [bovine spongiform encephalopathy].
Health chiefs are to take the unprecedented step of writing to all those
patients who received blood from donors who subsequently died from the brain-
wasting disease. The move, ordered by the Department of Health in England, is
the strongest sign yet that ministers are preparing for a new epidemic of the
disease spread through blood. Until now, they have always maintained that
infection through a transfusion is a "theoretical risk." The letters are to
be sent out to patients, including hundreds of Scots, at the end of September
2004, after the Health Protection Agency carried out a risk assessment on UK
patients who received blood, or plasma products, prior to all plasma being
sourced from the US in 1999 [1998 according to the BBC report above. -
Mod.JW].
It is understood that the letters will urge each patient to contact a
specialist. The vCJD risk assessment, 1st announced by Westminster Health
Secretary John Reid in December 2003, was ordered at the time as a
precautionary measure, after a patient, who had received a transfusion from
someone with vCJD, also died of the disease. Although the donor showed no
signs of the condition when giving blood in 1996, the disease developed in
1999, and, the donor subsequently, died from vCJD. The recipient of the blood
died in the autumn of 2003, and at a post-mortem, vCJD was found in the brain.
On 17 Dec 2003, the Health Minister told the Commons that the case
was "not a proven causal connection," but that "the possibility of
this being transfusion-related cannot be discounted." It was the 1st
report in the world to warn of the possible transmission of vCJD from
person to person via blood. In March [2004], he banned blood donations from
anyone who had received a transfusion since 1980 to prevent vCJD
being spread. The Department of Health last night [Sat 28 Aug 2004]
refused to reveal the outcome of the risk assessment, but it is
understood that behind-the-scenes talks have been ongoing with senior
health officials and groups, such as the Haemophilia Society, about
the potential outcome of the exercise. Other categories of patients,
such as those with leukemia, burn victims, and pregnant women, can
all be treated with blood products. But, those most exposed are
likely to be hemophiliacs, who use the products to help their blood to
clot.
The latest figures from the National CJD Surveillance Unit in Edinburgh show
that the number of deaths in the UK definitely or probably caused by vCJD now
stands at 147 (see part [1] above). However, news of the Department of Health
move has fueled fears of a new epidemic of vCJD, the human form of BSE, from
blood. Scientists have estimated that almost 4000 people could be harboring
vCJD, based on studies of appendix samples.
A Department of Health spokeswoman said: "We have asked the HPA to
lead on preparations for notifying patients who have received plasma
products, and we have been working with the agency, clinicians'
representatives, and patient groups."

[Dr. Janet Corry (<Janet.Corry@bristol.ac.uk>) has pointed out, in
relation to previous reports of the transmission of vCJD by blood
donation, that it was not mentioned in ProMED-mail, or elsewhere,
that the blood donated to the patient may not have been leucoreduced.
White blood cells are now routinely removed before blood in the UK is
transfused, and leuoreduction would have substantially lowered the
risk of infection in the recipient. The effectiveness of this
procedure is described by Greene et al. in the journal Lancet vol.
364, pp.529-531, 2004).
Professor Ironside, Director of the UK National CJD Surveillance Unit
in Edinburgh, has commented, in a recent Medscape interview,
<http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/488201>
that leucoreduction was implemented in the U.K. around 1999 because of
concerns about potential infectivity of vCJD in blood, or in blood
components. Leucoreduction has been used in other countries for other
purposes, as it does eliminate other cells associated with infections (e.g.
cytomegalovirus), and so it has other benefits. The effectiveness of this
step was not known at the time it was introduced. A number of recent studies
have suggested that, although leucoreduction basically may have some benefit
in reducing prion infectivity, it will not necessarily remove infectivity
completely, indicating that there is a need to look at other potential
measures which might help achieve this result. - Mod.CP]
