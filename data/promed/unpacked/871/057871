Poliovirus in Cameroon - update - 6 Sep 2014
-------------------------
In Cameroon, 2 new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases were reported from the East Region, with onset of paralysis on [26 Jun 2014] and [9 Jul 2014]. Genetic sequencing of these latest isolated viruses confirms continued wild poliovirus circulation, gaps in surveillance resulting in undetected transmission and geographic expansion to new areas of the country.

The outbreak in Cameroon has been ongoing since at least October 2013. The outbreak continued into 2014, with international spread to Equatorial Guinea. In March 2014, WHO elevated the risk assessment of international spread of polio from Cameroon to very high, due to expanding circulation and influx of vulnerable refugee populations from Central African Republic (CAR). This risk assessment remains in place. Further undetected circulation in Cameroon cannot be ruled out. Moreover, the risk of virus spreading into CAR is considered to be particularly high given the large-scale population movements from CAR into Cameroon.

In May 2014, the Director-General of WHO declared the international spread of wild poliovirus to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), under the International Health Regulations. Cameroon is one of the countries that meets the criteria for "states currently exporting wild poliovirus" and was, therefore, recommended to implement extraordinary measures to mitigate the risk of further international spread.

Cameroon has conducted 7 nationwide supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) in 2014. The next subnational SIAs are planned for [23-26 Aug 2014 and 4-7 Sep 2014] in 2 regions (East and Adamaoua) of the country, aiming to reach children aged less than 10 years and all age groups in formal and informal refugee camps. On [22 Aug 2014], CAR started a series of 5 sub-national polio immunization activities that will cover the western half of the country and which will end with the September [2014] synchronized round covering the central block countries of the African region.

Outbreak response quality to date in Cameroon has varied by geographic area. The confirmation of new cases and undetected, geographically-expanded spread of transmission has resulted in planning additional emergency outbreak response activities. Critical to success will be to ensure substantial improvement in the quality campaigns that reach all children multiple times with OPV. Equally important will be efforts to rapidly improve the quality of surveillance so that the full extent of the outbreak can be determined and tracked.

It is important that all countries, in particular those with frequent travel and contacts with polio-affected countries and areas, strengthen surveillance for acute flaccid paralysis cases in order to rapidly detect any new virus importations and to facilitate a rapid response. Countries, territories and areas should also maintain uniformly high routine immunization coverage at the district level to minimize the consequences of any new virus introduction.

[The above report opening paragraph explains the current situation clearly: "Genetic sequencing of these latest isolated viruses confirms continued wild poliovirus circulation, gaps in surveillance resulting in undetected transmission and geographic expansion to new areas of the country."

Multiple times during the course of 2014, there has been mention of the concerns of WPV transmission ongoing "under the radarscope" in Cameroon, and concerns about impacting neighboring countries. Unfortunately, this concern was realistic, as 5 WPV-associated polio cases have been confirmed in Equatorial Guinea, genetically related to WPV identified in Cameroon (see prior ProMED updates listed below for more details).

If one looks at a map of Cameroon (see http://healthmap.org/promed/?p=65), one sees that Cameroon shares borders with Nigeria to the north/northwest, Chad to the north/northeast, Central African Republic to the east, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon and the Congo Republic (Brazaville) to the south, all areas with potential for reintroduction of the WPV (note that it has been introduced to Equatorial Guinea and is still endemic in Nigeria). Borders in this region are very fluid, so the risk of introduction of the WPV is very real. - Mod.MPP]

Highlights of the week
----------------------
- Protecting west Africa: Even as polio programme staff across west Africa support efforts to control the Ebola outbreak affecting the region, preparations are going ahead for large scale multi-country vaccination campaigns in those countries not affected by Ebola, in mid-September [2014].

- In Nigeria, inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) has been used in early August [2014] during supplementary immunization activities in Borno and Yobe, reaching 0.6 million children. Further campaigns will integrate IPV, aiming to reach more than a million children by April 2015.

- Polio vaccination activities have resumed in parts of Helmand Province in the Southern Region of Afghanistan for the 1st time in 5 months. Upcoming immunization campaigns in September [2014] will cover the entire province.

Afghanistan
- No new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases were reported in the past week. The total number of WPV1 cases in 2014 remains 8. The most recent WPV1 case had onset of paralysis on [17 Jun 2014], from Khost province (linked to virus circulating in adjacent North Waziristan, Pakistan).
- Polio vaccination activities have resumed in parts of Helmand Province in the Southern Region of Afghanistan for the 1st time in 5 months. The [21-23 Sep 2014] activity will cover the entire province using bivalent OPV.

Nigeria
- No new cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) were reported in the past week. Nigeria's total case count for 2014 is now 6. The most recent case, which had onset of paralysis in Sumaila Local Government Area (LGA), southern Kano, on [24 Jul 2014], was the 2nd to be reported in the LGA this year [2014]. Kano is the only state with cases of WPV since April [2014].
- No new cases of type 2 circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV2) were reported in the past week. The total number of cVDPV2 cases for 2014 is 19. The most recent cVDPV2 case had onset of paralysis on [22 Jun 2014], also in Kano.
- The next subnational immunization days are planned for [20-23 Sep 2014] using bivalent OPV.

Pakistan
- No new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases were reported in the past week. The most recent case, which had onset of paralysis in Khyber Agency in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) on [30 Jul 2014], was the 117th to be reported this year [2014].
- Two new circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV2) cases were reported in the past week. One was in the Lakki Marwat district with onset of paralysis on [8 May 2014] and the other in Bannu district, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa on [3 May 2014]. The country has reported 18 cases of cVDPV2 in 2014, and the most recent case had onset of paralysis on [27 May 2014] in FR Bannu, FATA.
- Immunization activities are continuing, with particular focus on known high-risk areas.

Central Africa
- No new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases were reported this week. In 2014, 10 cases have been reported in central Africa: 5 in Cameroon and 5 in Equatorial Guinea.
- The outbreak in Cameroon has been ongoing since at least October 2013, with international spread to Equatorial Guinea in 2014. In March 2014, WHO elevated the risk assessment of international spread of polio from Cameroon to very high, due to expanding circulation and influx of vulnerable refugee populations from Central African Republic (CAR).
- Vaccination activities are planned in high-risk areas of Cameroon on [4-7 Sep 2014], in Equatorial Guinea on [4-7 Sep 2014], and in CAR on [12-14 Sep 2014], all using bivalent OPV.
- Between [18-23 Sep 2014], campaigns will be held across Cameroon, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Congo, Gabon, Chad, the Central African Republic and Equatorial Guinea and in Angola on [22 Sep 2014 - 5 Oct 2014].

Horn of Africa
- No new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases were reported in the past week. Five cases have been reported in the Horn of Africa to date in 2014: one WPV1 in Ethiopia (date of onset of paralysis on [14 Jan 2014]) and 4 WPV1s in Somalia (the most recent date of onset of paralysis on [3 Jun 2014] in Mudug, Puntland).
- The Polio Technical Advisory Group (TAG) for the Horn of Africa has warned that the outbreak is likely to continue in Somalia and possibly the Somali region of Ethiopia unless urgent improvements are made in SIA operations and surveillance and improved vaccination outreach is focused on pastoral communities.
- Immunization campaigns are planned for September [2014] in Yemen using trivalent OPV and in Ethiopia and Somalia using bivalent [OPV].

Israel and West Bank and Gaza
- Wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) is not being detected in environmental samples in Israel, the West Bank and Gaza Strip in recent months; the most recent positive sample was collected in southern Israel on [30 Mar 2014]. Environmental samples collected since April [2014] have been negative.

Middle East
- No new cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) were reported in the past week. Three cases of WPV1 have been reported in the Middle East in 2014, 2 in Iraq and one in Syria. The most recent case reported from Iraq occurred in Mada'in district, Baghdad-Resafa province, with onset of paralysis on [7 Apr 2014]. Syria's most recent case had onset of paralysis on [21 Jan 2014].
- Immunization campaigns are planned for [14-18 Sep 2014] in Iraq using bivalent OPV; Turkey, Syria, Jordan, Iraq, Egypt, Lebanon and the West Bank and Gaza are planning activities for October [2014].
- On [6-7 Sep 2014], WHO and UNICEF will review Phase II of the outbreak response in the Middle East and make the necessary tactical adjustments.

[Since the last ProMED-mail polio update (see Poliomyelitis - update (12): Brazil, Central Africa, global, WHO 20140626.2566185), there have been 43 new cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) reported worldwide, of which 38 were reported in endemic countries (Afghanistan - 2 cases, Pakistan - 34 cases, and Nigeria - 2 cases) and 5 have been reported in non-endemic countries (Somalia - 3 cases, and Cameroon - 2 cases).

In this same interval, the number of circulating vaccine derived polioviruses (cVDPV) associated poliomyelitis cases has increased from 25 to 37, with all cVDPV isolates coming from Nigeria (19) and Pakistan (18) (http://www.polioeradication.org/Dataandmonitoring/Poliothisweek/Circulatingvaccinederivedpoliovirus.aspx). As a reminder, the continued circulation of VDPVs serves as an indicator that there are pockets of susceptibles where the WPV can continue circulation as well.

As the above report suggests, polio vaccination efforts to maintain high levels of coverages in the west African countries presently dealing with the unprecedented Ebola virus disease (EBV) outbreak (Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia) have been put on hold. A worrisome occurrence for the polio eradication effort is the EBV disease outbreak in Nigeria, one of the 3 remaining endemic countries with WPV circulation. The devastating impact of the EBV outbreak includes the disruption of routine services which have been impacted severely and may well impact on other disease transmission within the countries as the infrastructure is focused on harnessing the EBV outbreak.

[3] Pakistan, (KP, FATA) 11 new cases - media report
Date: 5 Sep 2014
Source: Dawn [edited]
http://www.dawn.com/news/1130082/eleven-new-polio-cases-detected-in-kp-fata


Eleven new cases of polio have been detected on Friday [5 Sep 2014] in Khyber Pakhtunkhawa (KP) and Fata, increasing the number of cases so far this year [2014] to 138.

Official sources confirmed to Dawn.com that the new cases, reported to health authorities and polio programs, include 3 from KP and 8 from Fata.

Giving the breakdown of cases, sources said that Bara Khyber Agency has the highest number with 4 cases, South Waziristan and North Waziristan Agency 2 each, and 2 cases in Bannu and Tank each. The official further said that the high transmission season, from July to December, usually has more cases, a trend which has been witnessed in the last decade.

Comparatively, last year's [2013] figures were 31 by September 2013. This year's [2014] total has reached 138, with Fata on top with 102 cases, KP with 23, Sindh 11; Baluchistan and Punjab both had one case each.

In Fata, the number of cases reported includes 64 from North Waziristan, 25 from Khyber Agency, 11 from South Waziristan, and 2 from Bannu.

The fragile security situation across Fata and KP has left bordering towns high risk areas, which are more vulnerable to the virus spreading.

Earlier, Khyber Agency administration claimed that the P-3 polio virus has been eliminated from Bara, while P-1 was still prevalent, and that a special 3-day campaign was being launched from [8 Sep 2014] to administer anti-polio vaccine to children.

Political Agent of Khyber Agency Shahab Ali Shah, speaking to the media in Peshawar, said that the agency has always been portrayed negatively because of the polio virus spreading. He said that most of the areas remained inaccessible to polio teams, which caused the problem. Shah said, however, that special drives are being carried out to address the issue.

He also said that the United Arab Emirates government has extended a special package for the vaccinators, while the political administration will also award special remuneration for the campaign, which will be carried out under strict security.

[In the above media report, there is mention that with the confirmation of 11 new WPV associated cases of polio in Kyhber Pathunkhwa and FATA, there are now 138 cases of WPV confirmed in Pakistan since 1 Jan 2014. This is in contrast to the Polio Eradication Initiative update in section [2] above that mentions a total of 117 cases of WPV confirmed as of 2 Sep 2014.

To further complicate matters, according to the End Polio Pakistan 2 Sep 2014 briefing document, there have 119 cases of WPV confirmed in 2014, of which 89 percent are from FATA and Kyhber Pathunkhwa. Of those, 58 percent are from North and South Waziristan Agencies, where polio campaigns have been suspended for the past 2 years. There are an estimated 290 000 children less than 5 years old who have not been vaccinated. The report also mentions that there are now 17 districts (in Waziristan) that are known to have WPV circulation in contrast with 14 districts in 2013. The report also mentions that environmental sampling in 2014 has demonstrated that WPV is circulating throughout the country (see http://www.endpolio.com.pk/media-room/media-releases/128-pakistan-polio-update-briefer).

Clarification of the current official numbers of WPV associated polio confirmed in Pakistan in 2014 from knowledgeable sources would be greatly appreciated.
