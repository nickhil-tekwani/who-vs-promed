PM blames flu outbreak on villagers
-----------------------------------------
Caretaker Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra yesterday [26 Jul 2006]
blamed the fresh outbreak of bird flu in Phichit on alleged attempts
by villagers to cover up suspected cases, while the Agriculture and
Cooperatives Ministry acknowledged the need to improve its surveillance system.
Mr. Thaksin said some villagers tried to cover up suspected bird flu
cases for fear their fowl would be culled en masse.
Many poultry raisers in Phichit, the epicenter of the latest spread
of bird flu, did not register their fowl with the provincial
authority, and when their birds died of unknown causes, they disposed
of the carcasses themselves, he said.
Those villagers, therefore, exposed themselves to the risk of
infection by the deadly virus, Mr. Thaksin added.
Flu-prone localities would be declared ''red zones'' subject to
strict measures, ranging from disinfection of farms to a ban on fowl
movement. The zoning would affect only certain areas.
Agricultural and Cooperatives Minister Sudarat Keyuraphan shared the
view that some villagers in the affected areas were ignorant and
careless, but also admitted the ministry had not been proactive
enough in bird flu surveillance, resulting in the fresh outbreak,
which was confirmed on Monday [24 Jul 2006] in the northern province.
''We accept that our proactive efforts have not been quite effective,
because our officials found that many fowl deaths had gone
unreported,'' she said.
More officials have been assigned to work in risk areas to inspect
flu-like symptoms along with village volunteers since early this
month [July 2006], while the ministry will also coordinate with the
Public Health Ministry to tackle the problem, she said.
The new outbreak has left one man dead so far. The 17-year-old man,
of Phichit's Thap Khlo district, was yesterday [26 Jul 2006]
confirmed to have died from the deadly H5N1 strain of bird flu.
Thiravat Hemachudha, a neurologist at Chulalongkorn Hospital,
criticized the authorities' heavy reliance on local volunteers
without sufficient efforts to raise people's awareness of the disease
on a continuous basis. The case in which doctors failed to detect the
deadly virus in Yongyuth showed there was a lack of awareness in his
community, Dr. Thiravat said.
The Livestock Development Department now has about 60 000 volunteers
working together with some 700 000 others from the Public Health
Ministry to watch out for bird flu infections.
Following the latest outbreak, the chief of Phichit's livestock
office was transferred out of the province, and another official with
more expertise was sent to replace him, said Khunying Sudarat.
Phichit governor Pinit Pitchayakan said fowl began to die in large
numbers in May 2006. The situation got worse about a month later in
the districts of Bang Moon Nak, Thap Khlo and Dong Charoen [map at
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phichit_Province>].
The situation is better at the moment.
Thailand's latest case of human death from bird flu did not surprise
the World Health Organization (WHO). Somchai Peerapakorn, a medical
official of the WHO Thailand, said: ''I think it is a common
situation. When the H5N1 strain is found among fowl, people usually
become the next target of avian flu infection,'' he said.

Thailand: Bird flu reappears; PM asks poultry producers to register
-----------------------------------------------
Following the death of a young man from bird flu and the
hospitalization of 3 other persons in Thailand's northern province of
Phichit, Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra on Wednesday [26 Jul 2006]
urged poultry farmers to register their birds with the authorities.
It appears that a new outbreak of bird flu -- the 4th of its kind --
has emerged in Thailand following the cases in Phichit, according to
public health authorities.
The reappearance of avian influenza is being taken seriously by all
government and health-related agencies.
The government has banned the movement of poultry and will notify the
World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Organisation for Animal
Health (Office International des Epizooties or OIE).
The prime minister asked poultry producers at all levels -- whether
household farmers who keep a few birds or large-scale commercial
producers -- to inform public officials immediately if any of their
fowl died of unknown causes.
He said that a young man, a youth of 17 who died in Phichit, recently
had been infected with the H5N1 bird flu virus after having direct
contact with a dead chicken and did not notify the authorities.
The prime minister, however, said the government would not declare
the entirety of Phichit Province a bird flu outbreak area but would
declare only specific locations where the disease had been detected
as being at-risk areas.

[On 18 Jul 2006, when Thailand's Agriculture and Cooperatives
Ministry denied vehemently it had been covering up fresh outbreaks of
bird flu, the assistant to the agriculture and cooperatives minister
was quoted saying: "It's true that the disease, which is now endemic
to Thailand, may emerge again today or tomorrow" (see 20060718.1973).
Indeed a valid statement: Thailand is clearly endemically infected by
H5N1. The industrial, modern, advanced, large poultry plants seem to
have succeeded in protecting themselves by appropriate biosecurity,
avoiding vaccination; it is a different story in back-yard holdings
and in the massive fighting-cocks industry. To the objective
outsider, protecting this sector without vaccination seems extremely
difficult, if not impossible. - Mod.AS]
