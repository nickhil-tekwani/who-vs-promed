PENNSYLVANIA AGRICULTURE SECRETARY HAYES GIVES AVIAN INFLUENZA UPDATE
Mar. 4/98
HARRISBURG, Pa. -- Pennsylvania Agriculture Secretary Samuel E. Hayes Jr.
today said that two flocks of laying hens in Lancaster County have been
confirmed positive with the H7N2 avian influenza virus. Site quarantines
have been imposed on both premises.
"We are disappointed and concerned that the virus has appeared again. This
stresses the need for maintaining the strictest biosecurity," Hayes said.
"We must maintain our vigilance."
One flock of 100,000 laying hens is on a premise that was infected last
May. At that time, a flock was destroyed, and the houses were cleaned and
disinfected. They were left vacant for three months before new hens were
re-introduced. The new hens will not be destroyed.
The second flock of 92,000 birds is located south of the area that was
quarantined for a six-month period last year. This flock also will not be
destroyed. Both flocks will continue to be studied.
To date, 20 flocks have been determined to have the H7N2 virus, affecting a
total of two million birds. Hayes stressed that the most recent incidences
have been detected through intensive testing and the cooperative efforts of
the Agriculture Department and the poultry industry.
Last June, Gov. Tom Ridge signed legislation to appropriate $5 million for
poultry producers affected by the outbreak. Hayes said some of those funds
remain available.
He also stressed that the H7N2 virus is no threat to human health, and
poultry products are safe for human consumption.

[It is indeed unfortunate this has occurred again but important to note
that this H7N2 is NOT the same strain of highly pathogenic avian influenza
(HPAI) which caused the 1983 outbreak. The occurrence of such a HPAI
strain would indeed be a cause for great concern and likely mobilization of
USDA's emergency disease response. Interestingly, in contrast to the June
response, it appears that affected flocks will not be depopulation this
time around. It also bears repeating that this strain is NOT the same one
found in Hong Kong residents of either avian or human variety. - Mod.PC]
