Fort Belknap Bison Likely Died From Excess Salt, State Veterinarian Says
-----------------------------
Tribal and state officials Wednesday said no contagious disease killed 19 bison on the Fort Belknap Reservation in July. The animals were part of a herd of 56 "genetically pure" bison transferred to the reservation from Yellowstone National Park earlier in 2015.

State veterinarian Bill Layton says they probably died from an excess of salt, either because they didn't get enough water, or because the well water they were given was too salty.

"Our department, I think and the Tribe were very concerned about having an infectious disease. Because 1: the Yellowstone bison, 2:but also about the public health issues. We ruled that out immediately within the 1st week to 10 days."

Fort Belknap Tribal Council President Mark Azure rejects the claim that the bison might not have gotten enough water, but he says the important point is that no disease was involved.

"I don't know if we'll ever really know what took the lives of these animals. Salt toxicosis, could be. I don't know but again I respect the lab and what they've done."

Both men testified before the Montana Legislature's Environmental Quality Council. Cattle ranchers near the Fort Belknap Reservation are concerned because bison can carry the disease brucellosis, which can cause pregnant cows to spontaneously abort.

[Salt Poisoning/Water intoxication is an interesting and complex disease.

For purposes of this discussion, we will focus on cattle. Regarding salt poisoning/water intoxication, buffalo and cattle are likely similar, especially in the physiological aspects of this particular intoxication.

In general, animals can tolerate high concentrations of salt or sodium in the diet if they have continuous access to fresh water. Salt poisoning is often directly related to water consumption and can be reduced significantly or abolished completely by appropriate management of factors such as mechanical failure of waterers, overcrowding, unpalatable medicated water, new surroundings, or frozen water sources. Both swine and poultry on normal diets can be severely affected when water intake is completely restricted or when consuming high-salt diets with moderate water restriction. Increased water requirements increase the susceptibility of lactating cows and sows to salt poisoning, especially in response to sudden restrictions in water. Higher ambient temperatures may increase the need for water. Therefore in warmer or hotter climates, more water may be required to meet the need of the animal.

High concentrations of salt in the diet (up to 13 percent) have been used to limit feed intake of cattle. Salt-deprived animals or those not acclimated to high-salt diets can over-consume these feeds, making the animals prone to salt poisoning. Improperly formulated or mixed feed can be sources of excess salt. The use of whey as a feed or as a component of wet mash can add to sodium intake. Additional sources of excess sodium can include high-saline ground water, brine, or seawater.

In cattle, signs of acute salt poisoning involve the GI tract and central nervous system. Salivation, increased thirst, vomiting (regurgitation), abdominal pain, and diarrhea are followed by ataxia, circling, blindness, seizures, and partial paralysis. Cattle sometimes manifest belligerent and aggressive behavior. Sequelae of salt poisoning in cattle include dragging of hindfeet while walking or, in more severe cases, knuckling of the fetlock joint.

Postmortem examination may reveal some degree of gastric irritation, including ulceration and hemorrhages. The content of the GI tract may be abnormally dry. Histopathologic lesions may be limited to the brain and include cerebral edema and inflammation of the meninges. During the first 48 hrs, swine develop eosinopenia, eosinophilic cuffs around vessels in the cerebral cortex and adjacent meninges, and cerebral edema or necrosis. After 3-4 days, eosinophilic cuffs are usually no longer present. Cattle do not develop eosinophilic cuffs in the brain (which is characteristic in pigs) but can have edema of the skeletal muscles as well as hydropericardium. Chickens can also have hydropericardium. In acute cases, no gross lesions may be present in any species.

Serum and CSF concentrations of sodium over 160 mEq/L, especially when CSF has a greater sodium concentration than serum, indicate salt poisoning. Brain sodium concentrations above 2000 ppm (wet weight) are considered diagnostic in cattle and swine. However, very low concentrations of sodium in the brain may indicate that water was given to the animal, thereby diluting the brain sodium and causing edema of the brain.

There is no specific treatment for salt poisoning. Immediate removal of offending feed or water is imperative. Fresh water must be provided to all animals, initially in small amounts at frequent intervals to avoid exacerbation of clinical signs. On a herd basis with large animals, water intake should be limited to 0.5 percent of body weight at hourly intervals until normal hydration is accomplished, usually taking several days. Severely affected animals can be given water via stomach tube. The mortality rate may be greater than 50 percent in affected animals regardless of treatment. In small animals before the onset of clinical signs, the acute ingestion of salt can best be treated by allowing the animal access to water and closely observing it for several hours. Emetics may be used in dogs if known ingestions occur and the dog is not yet showing clinical signs.

For all affected animals, the treatment should slowly return the animal to normal water and electrolyte balance over 2-3 days. Quickly lowering the serum sodium concentration will increase the osmotic gradient between the serum and the brain, with water following the gradient into the brain and increasing the likelihood of severe cerebral edema.

Monitoring serum sodium concentration is the 1st step in treating individual animals. Serum sodium levels should be lowered at a rate of 0.5-1 mEq/L/hr. The use of slightly hypertonic IV fluids has been recommended to reduce the likelihood of cerebral edema. IV fluids can be made to approximate the serum sodium concentration of the animal, or a solution containing 170 mEq/L sodium can be used initially, with the concentration decreased as clinical signs improve. In dogs, a series of warm-water enemas given at intervals of several hours has helped reduce acutely increased sodium levels. If brain edema is suspected, mannitol, dexamethasone, or DMSO may be helpful.
