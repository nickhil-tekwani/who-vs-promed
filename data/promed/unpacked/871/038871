Re: Cryptococcus neoformans Â­ Canada (British Columbia) 20020608.4437, here
is some
additional information:
On June 6, 2002, the British Columbia Centre for Disease Control (BCCDC)
issued an advisory about cryptococcal disease on Vancouver Island following
the identification of 52 cases over the past 3 1/2 years. Subtyping has
found that the strain causing illness is serotype B, var. gattii. The cases
have not had HIV infection.
Forty-six cases have been residents of Vancouver Island, and 6 of them were
mainlanders who had travelled to the island. The cases have been
distributed along the warmer, drier east coast of the island. The first
cases became ill in early 1999. Prior to 1999 about 2 or 3 cases per year
were seen on Vancouver Island. The incidence rate on the island over the
past 2 years has been about 2.5 cases per 100 000. This is higher than
rates typically seen in Australia where the fungus has been associated with
Eucalyptus trees. Clinical presentations of our cases have been primarily
respiratory infection or meningitis. There have also been about 40 animal
cases including some porpoises found dead with cryptococcal pneumonia along
the coast of the Island.
The fungus has recently been isolated from hollowed or rotten areas on
several native tree species, including Douglas Fir and Red Alder, in a
coastal park in the central island.
It is now clear that this fungus has recently emerged on Vancouver Island.
The reasons for this are not clear, but hypotheses include importation with
tropical plants, and global warming. The ongoing investigation includes
surveillance, a case-control study, environmental sampling, and molecular
subtyping. We would appreciate hearing about any cases from other
jurisdictions that appear to be related to exposure on Vancouver Island.
The alert issued on 6 Jun 2002 was to advise the public and physicians about
symptoms of illness in order to allow early diagnosis and treatment, and
better outcomes. A travel advisory has not been issued because, although
the incidence has gone up, this remains a relatively uncommon infection.

[Thank you Dr. Fyfe for your rapid response, with more detailed
epidemiologic data on this unusual outbreak. This outbreak continues to be
unusual for its magnitude and the absence of underlying HIV infection among
the cases, albeit no mention is made of other possible immune compromised
status.
Of additional note is the mention of involvement of the animal population,
with several cases in porpoises. A PubMed search revealed several case
reports of cryptococcal pneumonia in dolphins, but no case reports as yet in
porpoises. It was interesting to see the wide spread nature of animals
reported with cryptococcosis, including felines (domestic and wild), canines
(domestic and wild), foxes, guinea pigs, birds, ferrets, monkeys, goats,
alpaca, horses, kiwi, koalas, cattle, suggesting widespread susceptibility
to infection with the organism.
We look forward to hearing more information on this outbreak and results of
the ongoing investigation as they become available. - Mod.MPP]
