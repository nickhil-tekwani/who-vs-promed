DRC reports more than 1000 monkeypox cases during 1st quarter of 2022
---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) has tallied 1088 monkeypox cases during the 1st 3 months of 2022, according to the latest information from the World Health Organization (WHO).

This is comparable to the number of cases reported during the same period in 2021 (1126).

A total of 52 fatalities have been attributed to monkeypox this year to date [20 Apr 2022] (CFR 4.8%).

Monkeypox is in the same family of viruses as smallpox but generally causes a milder infection. It can be spread between people through direct contact with skin lesions or body fluids, or contaminated materials such as clothing or linens. It can also be spread through large respiratory droplets which generally cannot travel more than a few feet, and prolonged face-to-face contact is required.

Illness typically begins with flu-like symptoms and swelling of the lymph nodes, progressing to a widespread rash on the face and body. Most infections last 2-4 weeks. The individuals identified as having been potentially exposed to this case will be monitored for symptoms of monkeypox for 21 days after exposure.

Human monkeypox infections primarily occur in central and western African countries.

[The above report of more than 1000 monkeypox cases in the Democratic Republic of the Congo so far in 2022 is not surprising. Monkeypox virus (MPXV) is endemic in DR Congo, and human cases occur there annually. As mentioned in previous reports, it is not clear how many of the reported cases above are laboratory confirmed. One wonders if many of the reported suspected cases that have not been laboratory confirmed may have been chickenpox, caused by varicella-zoster virus.

The situations under which the cases acquired their MPX infections are not reported, but some presumably were from handling infected wild rodents. Other individuals may have become infected from contact with MPX cases. Studies of prevalence of MPX virus in populations of rodent hosts are not mentioned in this or previous reports. The main reservoirs of MPX virus are suspected to be rodents, including rope squirrels (_Funisciurus_ spp., an arboreal rodent) and terrestrial rodents in the genera _Cricetomys_ and _Graphiurus_. Halting the bushmeat trade and consumption of wild animals to halt MPX virus exposure will be culturally and economically difficult, so the continued occurrence of cases can be expected.

The MPX virus clade involved in this outbreak and previous ones in DR Congo is not mentioned. As noted in previous ProMED posts, the monkeypox virus clade in the Congo Basin causes more severe disease in humans -- with a case fatality rate of up to 17% -- than the clade in Ghana, which causes few fatalities. - Mod.TY
