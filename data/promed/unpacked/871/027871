An outbreak of hepatitis E disease in the Protection of Civilians site in the UN base in Bentiu, the capital of South Sudan's Unity state, has killed 3 people out of 9 total cases, UNICEF said. The spread of hepatitis E is linked to contamination by fecal matter, usually in drinking water, according to the WHO.

UNICEF said in a weekly situation report that preventing spread of the outbreak will require provision of more safe drinking water at the base and better hand washing practices with soap. The report said that there are over 115 000 displaced people reported living inside the Bentiu UN base but only 10 operational boreholes. That means each person has access to only 10 liters of water available per person per day, below the international humanitarian standard of 15 liters per day.

The group said a new borehole is being drilled alongside construction of a new water distribution network expected to be completed within 2 weeks.

[Hepatitis E is found worldwide, and different genotypes of the hepatitis E virus determine differences in epidemiology. For example, genotype 1 is usually seen in developing countries and causes community-level outbreaks, while genotype 3 is usually seen in the developed countries and does not cause outbreaks. Globally, 57 000 deaths and 3.4 million cases of acute hepatitis E are attributable to infection with hepatitis E virus genotypes 1 and 2.

The highest seroprevalence rates (number of persons in a population who test positive for the disease) are observed in regions where low standards of sanitation increase the risk for transmission of the virus. Over 60 percent of all hepatitis E infections and 65 percent of all hepatitis E deaths occur in East and South Asia, where seroprevalence rates of 25 percent are common in some age groups. In Egypt, half the population aged above 5 years is serologically positive for the hepatitis E virus (http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs280/en/index.html). - Mod.LL
