Biysk (Altai region): One person died and 24 are in hospital with a disease
that medical experts have failed to diagnose, the chief of the Biysk city
health department in south Siberia told Tass on Tuesday.
Symptoms akin to pneumonia were registered among builders working on a bank
going up in the city of Gorno-Altaisk. Health department chief Sergei
Ivanov said the condition of those sick had improved. The worker who died
sought medical help a week ago. Consultations between epidemiologists,
experts in infectious diseases and pneumonia have delivered no conclusions.
More analyses have been made and results will be announced next week.

[With the limited information available in this report it is both difficult
and hazardous to venture a differential diagnosis. Nevertheless, an
outbreak of a pneumonia-like illness in construction workers suggests an
exposure to a common source, possibly soil-borne, such as seen in
legionellosis or some of the fungal pathogens such as histoplasmosis (both
of which have been reported in Russia, but rarely).
Outbreaks of legionellosis and the fungal pathogens tend to be more
frequent in warmer months, usually during summer and autumn in temperate
climate zones. If the "epidemic curve" of this outbreak is more consistent
with person-to-person transmission, influenza-related pneumonia (less
likely to be reported as a "mystery illness") or _Mycoplasma pneumoniae_
(also more usual during summer and autumn months) are also suspect
etiologies. ProMED-mail would appreciate more information on this outbreak.
