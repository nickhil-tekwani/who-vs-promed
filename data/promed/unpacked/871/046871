Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Suspected human to animal transmission

Epidemiological comments: Outbreak 1, 2 and 3 since [April 2020], a private company in Japan has been running a voluntary service to take care of companion animals owned by COVID-19 patients while the owners are in hospital or isolation. From late July to early August 2020, the dogs were entrusted to the private company by their owners who were to be hospitalized due to COVID-19. Nasal and throat swabs were taken from the dogs at the quarantine facility owned by the private company. Samples were tested positive for SARS-CoV2 by the tests conducted by the National Laboratory in Tokyo. The dogs were returned to the owners after negative results have been confirmed. The dogs were placed under quarantine until negative results were confirmed.

Note: Outbreaks 1 and 2 have already been reported to the OIE by the delegate letter dated on [7 Aug 2020]. Outbreak 4: The dog was temporarily transferred to the public facility on 12 Aug 2020 after its owner was hospitalized due to COVID-19. Nasal and oral swabs were taken from the dog at the public facility. Samples were tested positive for SARS-CoV2 by the tests conducted by the National Laboratory in Tokyo. The dog was placed under quarantine for sufficient time. None of these 4 dogs have exhibited any clinical signs. Note that the location of the outbreaks used in this report is that of MAFF to protect any data relating to human cases.

Control measures
Measures applied: traceability; quarantine; disinfection; vaccination prohibited; no treatment of affected animals
