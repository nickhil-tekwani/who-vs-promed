Wisconsin Deer Facing Another Fatal Disease
-------------------------------------------
A new disease has been diagnosed in deer in the state's wasting disease
eradication zone. State veterinarian Vickie Cooper said Tuesday some of the
deer found dead in an area west of Mount Horeb died of epizootic
hemorrhagic disease.
It's a viral disease carried by biting flies, mosquitoes, and other
insects. Cooper says it causes internal bleeding and a quick death.
Cooper said she believes 18 deer recently found dead in the 'hot zone' had
the disease. Cooper says cattle and people can't contract the disease.
The disease has already been found in Nebraska.

[Clinical EHD has already been reported this year, from Virginia, Ohio, and
North Carolina. Because, reportedly, low to nil EHD seroprevalence is seen
in the northwest, midwest, and northeastern USA, laboratory confirmation of
the Wisconsin cases, and further data on the alleged Nebraska cases, seem
to be required. Such information, as well as further evaluations of the
current geographic distribution of orbiviruses and their vectors in North
America, will be welcomed. - Mod.AS]
