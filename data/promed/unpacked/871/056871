The equestrian world is buzzing about a Brazilian outbreak of glanders disease, a deadly equine respiratory condition, as the sport's top riders and their mounts prepare to compete in next month's events in Rio de Janeiro [5 to 21 Aug 2016].

Highly contagious and incurable, glanders has prompted Brazilian agricultural officials to destroy hundreds of horses across the country over the past couple of years in an effort to stop the epidemic. That has infuriated some Brazilian breeders who say the threat is overblown.

Among those euthanized were 2 horses that had been housed at western Rio's Deodoro Military Complex, where the Olympic equestrian events will be held.

The disease has been eradicated around much of the world, and some feared exposing horses to glanders at the Olympics could exacerbate the outbreak and potentially extend it to other countries.

Organizers say the Olympic facilities are now safe and they have followed strict international protocols to create a disease-free zone. Competing horses arriving at Rio's international airport will effectively enter a protective biosphere, screened extensively for diseases and parasites beforehand, whisked to the Olympic venue upon arrival and quarantined there for the duration.

The measures "totally ensure all of the necessary sanitary precautions, allowing for the participation and return of the animals to their country of origin," said Guilherme Marques, the director of animal health at the Ministry of Agriculture.

No equestrian competitors have publicly pulled out of this year's Olympics over glanders fears, a sign that riders are satisfied with Brazil's efforts.

A 5-time Olympic dressage gold medalist from Germany, said she has "no worries" about coming to Rio.

"The horses will be staying in a bubble system with no contact with other animals apart from those competing with them," she said in an email to The Wall Street Journal.

Will Connell, director of sport for the US Equestrian Federation, said American riders are "very aware of the seriousness" of the threat, but they, too, are confident that Brazil has taken all necessary precautions.

Scrupulous sanitation is part-and-parcel of a sport where top horses can fetch hundreds of thousands of dollars.

Even so, just the specter of competing in a country where a life-threatening horse disease is active can put teams on edge, said Peter Timoney, former head of the Gluck Equine Research Center at the University of Kentucky.

"There is a lot of concern among teams of equestrian riders about sending horses, highly valuable horses, to countries where glanders exists," he said.

But outside the Olympic equestrian compound, Brazilian horse owners have questioned whether the country has a serious glanders problem at all. They say Brazil's Ministry of Agriculture acted too hastily in its bid quell fears ahead of the Olympics, euthanizing hundreds of animals and quarantining farms on the back of testing methods that often yield mixed results.

"They killed a lot of horses without truly knowing whether they had glanders or not," a horse breeder, said. Her 2 farms in São Paulo and Minas Gerais were quarantined for almost 2 years and 9 of her horses were put down. "They don't know how to diagnose it. They get false positives as much as false negatives."

Caused by the _Burkholderia mallei_ bacteria, glanders can cause ulcers and lesions in the horse's lungs, skin and respiratory tract. While donkeys and mules tend to die quickly, horses can carry the disease for years before succumbing to it. A zoonotic disease, it can also affect humans.

The disease has been largely eradicated in Europe and North America, thanks to strict sanitation. Until recently, glanders was thought to have been under control in Brazil, restricted to certain parts of the country's rural northeast.

But in 2013, an outbreak began in the country's most populous state, São Paulo, according to the World Organization for Animal Health. In 2015, glanders was traced to the Deodoro Military Complex in Rio. 2 horses were euthanized -- among the 623 horses put down between 2013 and 2015, according to the Ministry of Agriculture.

Lax sanitary controls between state borders allowed glanders to spread across Brazil, which has the 3rd-largest equine population in the world.

"We didn't used to have glanders," Valesca Peter dos Santos, a veterinarian trained to test for the condition in the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul. "It shouldn't exist here anymore."

Some Brazilian horse owners contend that the government has been overzealous in its efforts to control the disease. At their urging, Rio de Janeiro's Prosecutor's Office investigated the Ministry of Agriculture to determine whether it had culled animals unnecessarily.

That probe turned up no wrongdoing, but rural advocates are steamed that officials rushed to secure the Olympic venue quickly while their animals have been destroyed and properties quarantined in what they say is a slow, bureaucratic process.

"It is very difficult for us to understand the double standard," Ronaldo Caiado, a Brazilian senator who represents the rural state of Goiás, said in a public hearing in early July [2016].

Central to the controversy is the lack of a definitive method for testing for glanders. The various options often yield inconclusive results and need to be carried out in conjunction with each other.

Critics argue that Brazilian agents lack the necessary expertise to conduct the tests. In addition, due to mixed results yielded by tests, a definitive diagnosis often only comes through a necropsy carried out once the animal has been killed. The Brazilian government does not provide compensation for damages related to glanders, according to the Ministry of Agriculture.

"We will have to accept that horses with questionable results will have to be culled for the sake of freedom of disease," said Elke Reinking, spokesperson for the Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut in Germany, one of the world's flagship research laboratories for glanders.

[Mormo (in English, glanders) is a contagious infectious disease of equines, acute or chronic, usually fatal, caused by the bacterium _Burkholderia mallei_, and characterized by the development of ulcerated nodules that are most commonly found in the upper airway, lungs, and skin. Felines and other animals are susceptible to infection which is usually fatal. Humans can be infected and the microorganism (_B. Mallei_) is considered a potential bioterrorism agent.

The disease, one among the oldest known and that used to be prevalent worldwide, is currently eradicated or effectively controlled in many countries. Recently the disease has been reported in some countries, including Iraq, Turkey, Pakistan, India, Mongolia, China, Brazil, United Arab Emirates, and countries in Africa. Glanders is one of the diseases contained in the list of diseases for mandatory reporting to the World Animal Health Organization (OIE).

The bacterium _Burkholderia mallei_ a clonal pathogen, can be found in nasal secretions and skin ulcers of infected animals. The transmission of glanders occurs commonly from intake of water or food contaminated with nasal secretions and exudates eliminated from infected animals, contact with contaminated equipment (saddles, harness) and by eating contaminated equine meat. The microorganism is susceptible to heat, light, and disinfectants, but it can survive in contaminated areas for 1-2 months; humidity favors survival of the bacteria. The polysaccharide capsule is an important factor of survival and virulence.

After an incubation period of about 2 weeks, the infected animal usually has a high fever followed by a purulent nasal discharge, respiratory, and septic signs. Death occurs in a few days. Chronic disease is common in horses and presents a set of debilitating symptoms, with nodules and ulcers on the skin and in the nasal cavities; in such situations the infected animal can live for years, continuing to spread the microorganism. In some cases the infection can be latent and persists for long periods. Clinically, the disease can be in the form of nasal, pulmonary, and/or skin.

In the nasal form nodules arise in septum and turbinates. Nodules progress to irregular edged ulcers; star-shaped scars are characteristic after the resolution of the ulcers. In the early stage, submandibular lymph nodes are enlarged and edematous, adhering to the skin and deep tissues in advanced stages of the disease. In the pulmonary form, inflammatory nodules with caseous or calcified centers are found in the lungs. With the progression of the disease areas of consolidation and pneumonia may be present. The nodules may break and eliminate the inflammatory content into the bronchial tree, spreading the infection to the upper respiratory tract. In the cutaneous form nodules arise along the lymphatic vessels, especially on the extremities. The nodules may degenerate to form ulcers with drainage of highly infectious purulent material. The liver and spleen may have typical nodular lesions. Histologically, vasculitis, thrombosis, inflammatory cell infiltration and degeneration can be seen.

Diagnosis is based on clinical presentation (nodules, ulcers, scarring, impaired general condition of the animal); however, such signs/symptoms can occur late after infection. Laboratory diagnosis should be made as early as possible. Culturing _B. mallei_ from lesion material confirms the diagnosis. A delayed hypersensitivity test may be done by inoculation of mallein (a glycoprotein secreted by _B. mallei_) leading to purulent conjunctivitis and edema 24 hours after inoculation. A test based on complement fixation can also be used for screening, but the ELISA test, although more sensitive, is not being routinely used. PCR can be used for specific identification.

There are no vaccines. Prevention and control depend on early detection and eliminating infected animals in addition to quarantine and complete disinfection. Treatment, administered only in endemic areas, which does not lead to microbiological cure, is the use of doxycycline, ceftazidime, gentamycin, or streptomycin. Sulfa drugs (including in combination with trimethoprim) seem to be effective in prevention and glanders treatment.

A test that may not be validated and putting this number of horses at risk at this critical time is a disaster for Brazil. It will highlight any sanitary problems and laboratory issues as well. The minister was correct to send the samples to a lab approved to test for this disease. Let us sincerely hope these exposed horses are negative on this round of testing.

OIE WAHID's latest information shows continuing glanders in São Paulo and Minas Gerais states in 2014 (red circles on map; zoom in), but there have been no immediate or continuing event reports for Brazil in 2015. The OIE report and map are available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?reportid=11974. The OIE comment is borrowed from colleague Mod.JW.

Portions of this comment were extracted from http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/generalized_conditions/glanders/overview_of_glanders.html

"For glanders-free countries, there are [OIE] recommendations on importing equines. An international veterinary certificate is required attesting that the animals showed no clinical signs of glanders and were kept in an exporting country free of the disease for at least 6 months prior to shipment."
(http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Media_Center/docs/pdf/Disease_cards/GLA-EN.pdf).

It appears foreign horse owners will not be able to comply, therefore will be unable to repatriate their show horses? Further information would be welcome. - Mod.TG
