The Tanzanian government has sent a team of experts to investigate a malaria outbreak in Kagera region, Tanzania's Daily News reported on Saturday [8 Jun 2013]. More than 20 people, mostly children, have died of malaria in Kagera since the end of May [2013].

Deputy minister of health Seif Rashid said the government has ordered more medication to be sent to Rubya Hospital in Muleba District, where 30 to 40 new cases of malaria are reported daily. "We have enough ALu [artemether lumefantrine] drugs to last 280 days and quinine for 30 days at Rubya Hospital where an outbreak of malaria has been reported since [25 May 2013]," Rashid said, denying rumours of a shortage. "We are doing everything to serve the public and the situation is under control."

Irenei Kiria, executive director of Tanzanian health advocacy organization, Sikika, said there is a shortage of malaria drugs caused by the ministry's laxity in procuring enough medication from abroad. "This is a serious matter and we urge the ministry to urgently address it because there is no reason why people should die from malaria or lack of drugs," he said.

[It is difficult to know precisely what is happening, but clearly the incidence of malaria in the area is higher than normal and the supply of drugs for treatment seems inadequate. A surge of transmission seems the most probably explanation. An increase in resistance to drugs used for treatment would be expected to evolve more slowly. Alternatively, the cases were treated with a drug of inferior quality and progressed to severe malaria even with a fatal outcome. ProMED-mail will be happy to post further information. - Mod.EP
