Coconut growers' hope nipped in the bud
---------------------------------------
There seems to be no respite from woes for coconut growers [in Karnataka]. Following stem bleeding disease [ProMED-mail post 20120530.1149915], a large number of trees have now withered due to bud rot disease.

The coconut palms are grown exclusively in farms or only on the borders of the farms. The coconuts are sold either [as mature] or as tender nuts. The appearance of the bud rot disease in the area has created panic among the farmers who earned some income from coconut farming.

Coconut bud rot is a disease caused by a "fungus" (_Phytophthora palmivora_) [see comment below] that destroys the terminal bud and adjacent leaves finally killing the tree. Young palms are found to be most vulnerable.

[Bud rot (also called heart rot) of coconut palm can be caused by several species of fungus-like organisms in the genus _Phytophthora_, including _P. palmivora_ mentioned above, as well as some fungal species (such as _Fusarium_, _Thielaviopsis_) and bacterial species in the genus _Erwinia_. Different pathogens may be prevalent in different areas. Usually, the pathogens also affect other palm species, including oilpalm, and are favoured by high rainfall. Palms of all ages can be affected.

Symptoms may include discolouration, wilting, collapse, and death of young leaves, as well as drooping and distorted older fronds, defoliation, stem end rot of nuts, premature nut drop, nut discolouration, and rotting of the growth bud ("heart" of the palm) leading to the death of the tree.

The pathogens enter the host via the crown. They are spread by wind splashed rain, mechanical means (including insect activities), and with infected plant or other material. Disease management may include cultural practices (phytosanitary measures, nutritional improvements), removal and burning of severely affected palms, and treatments with appropriate agrochemicals (for example copper compounds) at or before onset of symptoms.

An outbreak of stem bleeding of coconut was also reported recently from Karnataka (ProMED-mail post 20120530.1149915). This disease may be caused by the soilborne fungus _Ceratocystis paradoxa_, which infects wounds in the trunk. There does not appear to be an obvious connection between the 2 problems, other than possibly a suboptimal general health status of palms in the region.
