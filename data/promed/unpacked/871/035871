Three new outbreaks of H5N8 highly pathogenic avian influenza [HPAI] have been found in Taiwan.

The 3 outbreaks were detected in chickens in an abattoir in Taipei City and in Kaohsiung City, and geese on a farm in Tainan City.

Nearly 3000 birds died or were destroyed in total as a result of the outbreak.

Intensified surveillance zones have been put in place around the infected farm, and the abattoir cases have been traced back to the farms of origin.
