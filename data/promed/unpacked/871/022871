A week ago, a man died of anthrax in Nyeri after eating infected cow meat.

A week earlier, although not reported, 2 rhinos from Nairobi National
Park died of anthrax. The Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) confirmed the
cause of deaths.

A week ago, a man died of anthrax in Nyeri. (KWS) confirmed the cause of death.

The death of the man should raise the red flag. There is great fear
that some of the meat being sold in and around Kitengela and Ongata
Rongai butcheries could be contaminated with anthrax, foot and mouth
[disease], and east coast fever. Investigations by The Standard on
Saturday [5 Sep 2009] revealed that sick and dying cattle are
slaughtered on the roadsides and expose nearby communities to outbreaks.

Last week, 5 km into Masai Lodge Road in Ongata Rongai, where herders
have set up temporary bomas [a boma is an enclosure to keep
livestock, usually made of thorn bushes, also known as a zariba], a
team from The Standard found sickly cattle being slaughtered for
distribution to neighbouring butcheries.

Mr Rolf Schmid, a restaurateur who has lived in the area for almost 2
decades, raised the alarm. "My 1st instinct was to contact the
Ministry of Health and veterinary officials to come and witness the
slaughter of dying cattle," he said.

The Ministry of Public Health officers and vets from Kajiado concur
that some of the cattle appeared sickly, although not all were
emaciated. The government health officials, who sought anonymity
because they are not authorised to be quoted, confirmed that the
animals pose danger.

Due to [the present severe] drought, Maasai herders drive the cattle
up to the city [Nairobi], and many of them are kept in bomas along
Mombasa Road. Tens of thousands of cattle that have been migrating
from Loitokitok, Tsavo West, Kibwezi, Sultan Hamud and Kajiado are
also being held in bomas on the northern and southern sides of the
Nairobi National Park. By day, these cattle are hosted on the local
ranches around the park and by night driven inside it for grazing.
Early this week, The Standard observed hundreds of cattle being
driven into the park on the southern end from the Masai Lodge Road.
Tired and exhausted, they walked in a profile, with some not
completing the journey.

According to a KWS senior warden, herders have been cutting the fence
to allow large numbers of cattle into the park. KWS impounded 1000
cattle, and when the herders came for them the next day, they said
some of the animals belong to "well connected Kenyans."

Due to severe drought and exhaustion of grazing fields, Nairobi
National Park is the only location [near the] city with ample
grazing. But now it is also massively threatened with decimation.
More worrying is the fact that the wild animals are also at great
risk of being infected with diseases. KWS officials say some
antelopes have been infected with foot and mouth disease.

In a meeting this weekend with the warden of Nairobi National Park,
Mr. Michael Wanjau of KWS, and some other government officials, as
well as residents of the area, it was revealed that tens of thousands
of cattle are grazing in the Nairobi National Park as a result of the
ongoing devastating drought.

Mr Wanjau admitted that the numbers of cattle in the park have
reached record levels. So weak from walking hundreds of kilometers in
search of grazing, many do not make it. Some herders are cutting the
fence of the park to let cattle in. Some are being herded across rivers.

The southern part of Nairobi park is littered with cattle carcasses,
and vultures, hyenas and lions have eaten their fill.

Out on the staging grounds in Kitengela, adjacent to the park where
cattle are gathering, hundreds are dying, and nobody is removing
carcasses. The Kenya Meat Commission tried to buy up the herds for
Ksh 8000 per cow [about USD 100], but herders have refused to sell;
they say they are hoping for rain.

Some dead and dying cattle are being butchered on the roadsides,
which poses a horrific public health situation. The Ministry of
Health is being informed as I write this blog post. Many cows
affected by foot and mouth disease simply cannot walk anymore.

The meeting on Saturday [5 Sep 2009] determined that the situation is
a crisis which demands that the government conduct compulsory
purchase of cattle to avert a public health and environmental
disaster. But it is being whispered that these cattle are owned by
rich and powerful Kenyans, a challenge that few Kenyans are willing
to take head on.

It has long been a problem in East Africa that local herders will
move their cattle into the national parks because of the grazing
there and the over-grazing outside the parks. And as anthrax is
enzootic in the wildlife in virtually every African national park,
the immediate risks are obvious. The day is long past when these
marginal herds were vaccinated against anthrax. Until the drought in
East Africa breaks, it can only get worse.
