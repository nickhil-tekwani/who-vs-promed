AIR SAFETY & HEALTH
===================
Date: Wed, 2 Apr 1997 12:48:40 -0800 (PST)
From: Chuck Woolery <chuck@igc.apc.org>

[The following letter has been sent to the Editor of TIME magazine, in
response to an article in the current issue]
Dear Editor,
"Flying into trouble" March 31, 1997, was frightening reading but it missed
half the danger. The life and death risk to Americans from air-travel goes
far beyond the safety of aircraft. It extends all the way to the health of
non-travelers and non-Americans in far-away villages.
US vacation, military, business and religious travelers mix daily with the
half of
humanity attempting to survive on less than $1 a day. Every day infectious
diseases, growing in quantity and lethal quality, kill approximately 50,000
of these impoverished people. That's equivalent to over 100 jumbo jets
crashing each day with no survivors.
Most diseases would cost less than a cup of coffee to prevent or cure.
With more than 2 million privileged passengers crossing national borders
every day virtually unrestricted, we might be smart in helping the
underprivileged of the world, if airline safety is really a concern.
Perhaps an international flight tax could help fund this noble,
self-serving goal.
