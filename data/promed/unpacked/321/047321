Dear Colleague,

In just the past 3 days, ProMED-mail has published reports on polio in
Nigeria, epizootic hemorrhagic disease in deer in New Jersey, rabies
in Ghana, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever in Sindh, leptospirosis in
Sri Lanka, and a new swine flu variant in Hong Kong.

No other source brings you the accurate, relevant, and timely emerging
infectious disease reporting that ProMED-mail provides multiple times
each day. Covering the entire One Health spectrum of human, animal,
and crop plant diseases, ProMED-mail brings you news and unique expert
interpretation and context that inform you about the disease and help
you understand how it might affect you, your family, your patients,
your business, and your plans. No other source keeps you so well
informed on topics you need and want to know about. No other source
covers the topic of infectious diseases so broadly, deeply, and
internationally.

If, like 96 percent of readers, you think that ProMED-mail is
important to your work and life please join me in giving generously to
the 2011 Fall fundraising campaign now underway.
