In reply to your request from September 23rd we submit a short report of a
patient with travelers diarrhea from India due to _V. cholerae_ O139. We
will also inform WHO.
Since 1992, epidemics of cholera due to a new non-O1 _V. cholerae_ strain
have been detected in India and Bangladesh. The strain had been designated
as a new serogroup O139 Bengal. _V. cholerae_ O139 had been detected as a
cause of travelers diarrhea since then in 10 countries. We report on the
first patient with diarrhea associated with _V. cholerae_ O139 in the
Netherlands.
A 30-year-old male patient was admitted on June 23 at the Academic Medical
Center in Amsterdam with severe watery diarrhea without fever. He had
interrupted his holidays in India because of 10 days existing diarrhea not
responding to treatment with opiate-containing drugs to control
gastroenteritis. Diarrhea started after a short stay at Delhi and worsened
during his trip to Agra, Japier, Jaisalmer and Jodhpur in India. Two fellow
travelers also developed diarrhea which spontaneously resolved. Stool
cultures taken at the AMC before antibiotic treatment with ciprofloxacin
was started, revealed _Vibrio cholerae_ O139 Bengal, _Salmonella emek_ and
_Campylobacter jejuni_. The patient recovered completely and was discharged
10 days after admission. Identification of the O139 strain was confirmed at
the RIVM (Bilthoven, the Netherlands) using a specific anti-O139 antibody.
The _V. cholerae_ O139 strain was not resistant to
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and to O/129, suggesting that these
proporties can no longer be used for the presumptive diagnosis of O139
cholera. The protracted course of the intestinal infection in this patient
is due to the mixed infection with _Vibrio_, _Salmonella_ and _Campylobacter_.
