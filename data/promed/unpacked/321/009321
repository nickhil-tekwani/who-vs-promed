A statement from the Superintendent of Health Surveillance
----------------------------------------------------------
I wish to inform you with respect to a South African national, a
businessman, who died in Rio de Janeiro on Tue 2 Dec 2008. He
traveled directly, by air, from Johannesburg, South Africa, to Rio de
Janeiro, Brazil. He arrived in Rio de Janeiro on Fri 23 Nov 2008. He
did not travel to any other location in Brazil prior to the onset of
his illness.

He 1st showed signs of illness on 27 Nov 2008. He manifested the
following symptoms: high fever, chills, myalgia, a rash, vomiting,
hematuria, hepatoesplenomegaly, jaundice, and exhaustion, which
progressed to renal insufficiency and respiratory insufficiency. He
checked into a hospital on Fri 28 Nov 2008, and died on 2 Dec 2008.
15 days prior to his arrival in Rio de Janeiro, he had an orthopedic
surgical procedure performed at Morningside hospital, Johannesburg,
South Africa. At this time there was an outbreak of an arenavirus
[infection] in that hospital which originated with a patient who came
to that hospital from Zambia. There were a resultant 4 additional
hospital-acquired cases of the same disease.

We are investigating arenavirus, hantavirus, hepatitis, rickettsia,
yellow fever, dengue fever, and leptospirosis. We have a list of all
his contacts at the 2 hospitals in Rio de Janeiro where he was seen,
the hotel where he stayed and his job. They will be monitored for 21
days following his death.

Febrile Hemorrhagic Syndrome in Brazil
--------------------------------------
On the first of December 2008, the Ministry of Health of Brazil
reported the occurrence of a case of acute hemorrhagic febrile
syndrome in a 53-year-old male from Johannesburg, South Africa, with
onset of symptoms on 23 November. The patient was hospitalized on 28
November with as suspected case of nephrolithiasis and died on 2
December.

The main symptoms reported are described in Technical Note 03/12/2008
issued on 3 December 2008 by the Ministry of Health, Secretary of
Health Surveillance (MS/SVS) of Brazil (in Portuguese).

Clinical-epidemiological investigation of this case is being carried
out by a multidisciplinary team led by the Secretariat of Health
Surveillance. A differential diagnosis is being carried out for
several agents related to hemorrhagic syndrome, such as arenavirus,
rickettsiosis, leptospirosis, hantavirus, malaria, and dengue, among
others. One of the diagnostic hypotheses being considered is that the
patient could have been infected by the new arenavirus recently
reported in Zambia and South Africa. Laboratory tests are considering
all these diagnostic hypotheses, working in collaboration with a team
of professionals from South Africa who are actively involved in the
investigation.

Monitoring of the contacts identified in this case is being carried
out. Other clinical cases have not been recorded to date.

The Pan American Health Organization is actively supporting the
investigation of this case at both the level of its country office in
Brazil and at its Regional headquarters.

Technical note: In view of the fact that one of the hypotheses being
considered is that the case might be that of infection by the new
arenavirus, we reiterate following the recommendation for continued
monitoring of contacts as laid down in the WHO guidelines Interim
Infection Control Recommendations for Care of Patients with Suspected
or Confirmed Filovirus (Ebola, Marburg) Haemorrhagic Fever in
document BDP/EPR/WHO[1] dated March 2008, which recommends checking
body temperature twice a day. Should fever develop, the contact
should be examined by a designated physician.
