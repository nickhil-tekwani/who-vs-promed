[Even though this is a low-path variety of avian
influenza which has little possibility, in its
present form, of causing much mortality in
poultry (and even less of a threat to humans),
recent changes in OIE regulations require
reporting to help monitor these strains. As
noted in this report, H5 and H7 avian influenza
in its low pathogenic form in poultry is a
notifiable disease as per Chapter 2.7.12. on
avian influenza of the Terrestrial Animal Health Code. - Mod.PC]
