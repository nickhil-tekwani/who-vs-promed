Elk from Olmsted County herd depopulated to control CWD
--------------------------------------------------------
The Minnesota Board of Animal Health announced today [30 Oct 2009]
that the farmed elk herd in Olmsted County has been depopulated and
tested for chronic wasting disease (CWD).

In January 2009, a female elk from the herd tested positive for CWD.
The remaining elk in the herd were removed to minimize the risk of CWD
spreading to other farmed deer and elk or to wild white-tailed deer in
the area. Marksmen from Wildlife Services, a division of the United
States Department of Agriculture (USDA), euthanized the animals in
September [2009]. [This is confusing. Marksmen euthanized the animals?
Did they use darts with euthanasia solution? I find that unlikely.
While gunshot is an approved method of euthanasia according the
American Veterinary Medical Association Panel on Euthanasia, it seems
that calling this depopulation by gunshot "euthanasia" is extremely
stretching the definition of euthanasia. - Mod.TG]

USDA, Veterinary Services and Board personnel collected samples
[brain] from each elk. Those samples were submitted to the US
Department of Agriculture's National Veterinary Services Laboratory
(NVSL) in Ames, Iowa for testing. A total of 3 additional elk from the
558-head herd tested positive for CWD, 1 male and 2 females.

In 2003, Minnesota implemented mandatory registration and CWD
surveillance programs for farmed cervidae herds (members of the deer
and elk family). When farmed cervidae over 16 months of age die or are
slaughtered [for meat consumption], herd owners must submit brain
samples [from those animals] for CWD testing.

CWD is a fatal brain and nervous system disease found in cervidae in
certain parts of North America. The disease is caused by an abnormally
shaped protein called a prion, which can damage brain and nerve
tissue. Infected animals show progressive loss of body weight with
accompanying behavioral changes. In later stages of the disease,
infected animals become emaciated (thus "wasting" disease). Other
signs include staggering, consuming large amounts of water, excessive
urination, and drooling.

According to state health officials and the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, there is no evidence that CWD can be
transmitted to humans.

[How much money has been spent trying to eliminate a disease that has
been known to be in the United States since approximately the 1960's
and has never been known to transfer to humans or have an impact on
trade issues?

Likewise, while millions of dollars have been spent trying to
eliminate a disease that has no human health or trade effects, how
much money has been invested in curing or learning more about the
disease? One has to wonder at some point what the goal is and what the
priorities are, and are we operating out of fear and possibilities or
facts?
