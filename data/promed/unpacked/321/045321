PAVILLION, Wyo.: A 30-year-old woman was bitten by a rabid cat, the first
reported case of the disease in a domestic animal in Wyoming this year.
The woman was bitten on 2 Apr 2001, while attempting to remove a sickly
stray cat from the crawl space beneath her house last week, authorities said.
The woman then contacted Larry Zoller, the town's maintenance supervisor,
who recognized the potential for rabies, killed the cat, and took it to a
veterinarian in Lander. The woman is undergoing a series of rabies
vaccinations.
"If Larry Zoller had simply discarded the cat, the results could have been
fatal for this woman," said Judith Birr, Riverton public health nursing
supervisor.
Birr urged residents to vaccinate their animals. "This is a step up," she
said. "We haven't had a rabid cat in this county, and once rabies gets into
domestic animals, it's very hard to control."
Karl Musgrave, administrator of the Wyoming Department of Health's
Preventive Health and Safety Division, said, "Seeing a rabid cat is
probably an indication rabies is becoming more common in Fremont County,
especially in skunks."
Three rabid cats were reported last year in Wyoming, in Sheridan, Crook,
and Converse counties. As of 31 Mar 2001 of this year, 2 rabid skunks were
confirmed in Fremont County and 9 in Sweetwater County.

[Rabies can happen anywhere, whether in the suburbs or rural countryside.
Rabies vaccination for domestic animals is essential in protecting human
lives and avoiding the heartache of having the family pet destroyed because
of a preventable disease. ­ Mod.TG
