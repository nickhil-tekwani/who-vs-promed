Outbreak of Serotype 5 Pneumococcal Disease in Vancouver, British
Columbia, Canada
-----------------------------------------------
Vancouver, British Columbia (BC) is experiencing an outbreak of
invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in an inner city neighborhood. To
date in 2006, 376 cases of IPD have been reported in BC (incidence
8.7 cases/100 000 population); 137 of these are from Vancouver
(incidence 22.9 cases/100 000 population). The majority of these
cases are serotype 5.
The Vancouver outbreak was identified by St. Paul's Hospital, which
serves Vancouver's inner city. Normally, 0-5 cases of IPD are
admitted per month to St. Paul's Hospital. An increase began in
August 2006; 46 cases of IPD were admitted in November 2006 and
admissions are continuing in December 2006. Serotype data available
to date indicate that 85 percent of cases from St. Paul's Hospital
are serotype 5. A small number of serotype 5 cases have also been
admitted to other hospitals in Greater Vancouver, most with direct
links to Vancouver's poor inner city neighborhood. To date, 6 BC
serotype 5 IPD cases have been reported from areas outside of
Vancouver. Of these, 4 had some connection with the affected
Vancouver demographic; exposures for the other 2 are being assessed.
Serotype 5 _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ was previously uncommon in BC
(one case per year in 2004 and 2005), but was responsible for recent
outbreaks among similar high-risk populations in neighboring Alberta.
Risk factors for cases include homelessness or living in rooming
houses, use of crack cocaine and other illicit drugs, and underlying
medical risk factors such HIV and hepatitis C infection. Many cases
require ICU admission, and there have been at least 3 deaths. There
has not been an increase in cases of simple pneumonia associated with
this outbreak of invasive disease.
In response to the outbreak, Vancouver Coastal Health launched a
pneumococcal immunization campaign in inner city Vancouver beginning
in early November 2006. Polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccine
(23-valent, including serotype 5) is being given in rooming houses,
shelters, food banks and other community locations by teams of
outreach nurses. This campaign is modeled after similar, successful
immunization blitzes for influenza, hepatitis A and hepatitis B in
the same neighborhood. Other health responses in BC include:
* accelerated pneumo 23 polysaccharide immunization of indigent and
drug-using people in regions adjacent to Vancouver
* enhanced surveillance by serotype to track the distribution of
disease within BC
* stringent facility infection control practices
Updates on changes in epidemiology of IPD in neighboring states and
provinces would be appreciated.

[Invasive pneumococcal disease is quite common, and the pneumococcus
is the most frequent cause of bacteremia. However, the incidence
figures cited for Vancouver in the report are higher than those seen
normally in the era since routine pneumococcal conjugate vaccine use.
The routine use of these conjugate vaccines in children has
dramatically reduced the rates of invasive pneumococcal disease in
children and appears to be reducing the disease burden in the rest of
the population as well.
It is interesting to note that pneumococcal serotype 5 (serotype
designations are based on the structure of the bacterial
polysaccharide capsule) is not included in the conjugate vaccines,
which currently cover only the 7 most prevalent serotypes (there are
over 90 known serotypes). One of the fears regarding widespread
vaccination has been that "serotype replacement" would occur with
non-vaccine serotypes. This appears to be happening in the Vancouver
and Alberta outbreaks, hence the recommendation here for vaccination
with the older, unconjugated 23-valent vaccine that does confer
protection to serotype 5. Unfortunately, the older vaccine is less
immunogenic and works poorly in young children, the highest risk group.
No information on antibiotic resistance is given, suggesting that the
isolates have been penicillin-susceptible.
The authors of the report have requested information regarding
pneumococcal disease in neighboring areas, and ProMED would also be
interested in any such data. - Mod.LM]
