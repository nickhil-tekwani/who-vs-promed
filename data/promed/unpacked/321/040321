Epidemic Cases of Foot-and-mouth Disease On Rise in Mongolia
----------------------------------------
More cases of foot and mouth disease (FMD) have been reported in farms
across 2 eastern Mongolian provinces bordering China.
As of Wednesday, the epidemic has struck 32 places in the provinces of Suhe
Bator and Dornod where 419 head of cattle infected with the disease have
died and another 200 were slaughtered.
FMD primarily affects cattle, sheep, pigs and deer but is rarely a danger
to humans.
The reports said 821 head of cattle have contracted the disease and some 83
600 others are at [risk.
The 2 provinces have been put on full alert and the roads leading to other
parts of the country sealed off by the authorities since 12 Feb 2001.
After the outbreak of the disease in the country, Mongolia purchased 400
000 U.S. dollars worth of vaccines from Russia and vaccination is now
underway in the 2 provinces.
The epidemic dealt another blow to Mongolia's farming industry, already
battered by disastrous blizzards, killing more than 1.4 million head of
livestock early this year.
