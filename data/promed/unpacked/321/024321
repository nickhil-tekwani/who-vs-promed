Measles outbreak among travellers returning from a mass gathering,
Germany, September to October 2010
-------------------------

Summary
-------
In September and October 2010, 13 primary measles cases were
identified among unvaccinated persons aged between 9 and 32 years
(median: 16.5) in 11 districts in Germany. All cases had attended
meetings in Taize, France. This outbreak illustrates the risk of long
distance spread of infectious diseases associated with international
mass gatherings, and underlines the importance of closing immunisation
gaps against measles by vaccinating non-immune adolescents and young
adults.

Introduction
------------
Reports on measles outbreaks in Europe point to the importance of
travelling non-immune adolescents and young adults in spreading the
disease. Measles outbreaks related to short commutes [1],
intermediate, and long distance travel [2,3] have been reported in the
past. We describe an outbreak that affected predominantly adolescents
and young adults who had recently participated in meetings in Taize,
France. Taize is home to an ecumenical Christian community of
Protestant and Catholic traditions and is one of the most important
sites of Christian pilgrimage. Meetings draw thousands of young people
from around the world for contemplation, Bible study and communal work.

Outbreak investigation
----------------------
Between 13 and 21 Sep 2010, public health authorities in the German
Laender of Baden-Wuerttemberg and North Rhine-Westphalia received
notifications of 6 measles cases in adolescents who had recently
returned from meetings in Taize, France. This was communicated in a
public health notice in the German epidemiological bulletin [4] in
order to alert the public health community, and to identify any
additional cases. A case was defined as clinically diagnosed or
laboratory-confirmed measles infection notified in September or
October 2010 in a person who had recently travelled to Taize. French
authorities were informed about the outbreak by the Robert Koch
Institute via the Early Warning and Response System (EWRS).

The Taize Community was contacted via electronic mail, and designated
a contact person who responded to e-mails and telephone calls with
helpful information about the setting. All patients were contacted by
local health authorities via telephone or in writing and were
interviewed about their history of measles, immunisation with measles
virus-containing vaccine, and details of travel and accommodation,
where available. Diagnostic confirmation of cases was sought by
laboratory detection of measles virus-specific IgM in samples from the
patient or any secondary or tertiary case. Whenever possible, samples
of blood, oral fluid and urine were collected and forwarded to the
National Reference Centre Measles, Mumps, Rubella to further confirm
the diagnosis by measles virus genotyping and to investigate
transmission chains.

Results
-------
[Interested readers are referred to the original text for the
documentation, its analysis and the relevant literature references,
available at the Source URL, above.]

Phylogenetic analysis was based on a 456-nucleotide sequence encoding
the C-terminus of the measles virus Nucleocapsid-protein. The cases
analysed showed the genotype D4 variant 'D4-Manchester' (MVs/
Manchester.GBR/10.09[D4], GenBank accession number: GQ370461). This
suggests that the German cases with a suspected link to the meetings
in Taize belong to the same chain of measles virus transmission.
Occurrence of measles virus variant D4-Manchester in western and
central parts of Europe from 2008 onwards is reported in the GenBank
and the MeaNS database. In 2010, this variant was identified several
times in France [5]. [According to the MeaNS database D4 is the most
common measles genotype globally (see:

Discussion
----------
In Europe, measles outbreaks have been reported to occur in, among
other settings, anthroposophical communities [6], minority populations
[7] and unvaccinated preschool children [8]. In the United States
where elimination has been achieved, the challenges to maintain
elimination are considered to include outbreaks of measles resulting
from travel to countries where measles is still endemic, frequent
international travel and persons who remain unvaccinated because of
personal belief [9].

This multilocal outbreak illustrates the risk of exposure to measles
virus at mass gatherings while measles elimination has not yet been
achieved. In addition, it underlines the potential for long-distance
spread of measles virus by mobile, non-immune adolescents and adults.
We consider it likely that additional measles cases may have occurred
among persons who visited Taize at the end of August 2010 and returned
to other destinations, where the possible source of exposure went
unnoticed or remains unpublished.

In 2008, the nationwide measles vaccination coverage for German
children at the time of their school entry examination (5 to 6 years)
was 95.9 percent for the 1st dose, and 89 percent for the 2nd dose,
with considerable geographical variation [10]. While measles
vaccination coverage among younger children is on the rise, it should
not be forgotten that immunisation coverage in older age cohorts may
not yet have reached levels required for measles elimination.

In conclusion, measles may be reintroduced by returning travellers or
visitors who have been infected with the virus. Public health policy
should recognise the importance of proactive information of
adolescents and young adults in order to address gaps in individual
measles immunity, and by encouraging the vaccination of non-immune
adolescents and young adults.
