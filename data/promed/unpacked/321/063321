After 2 horses in the past 2 weeks tested positive for a mosquito-borne illness, health officials in Nassau County issued a warning to residents who could be at risk.

Since the beginning of the year [2018], 4 horses have tested positive for eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) infection in Nassau County, including 2 in the past 2 weeks.

One sentinel chicken also tested positive for EEEV in 2018.

Officials said the risk of transmission to humans has increased, and they're urging residents to take precautions against exposure to mosquitos, which carry and transmit the virus.

To protect yourself from mosquitoes, you should remember to "Drain and Cover:"

Drain standing water to stop mosquitoes from multiplying.

Drain water from garbage cans, house gutters, buckets, pool covers, coolers, toys, flower pots or any other containers where sprinkler or rain water has collected.

Discard old tires, drums, bottles, cans, pots and pans, broken appliances and other items that aren't being used.

Empty and clean birdbaths and pet's water bowls at least once or twice a week [Pets need cool fresh water, and clean, fresh water should be provided daily, even for your feathered friends. - Mod.TG].

Protect boats and vehicles from rain with tarps that don't accumulate water.

Maintain swimming pools in good condition and appropriately chlorinated. Empty plastic swimming pools when not in use.

Cover skin with clothing or repellent.

Clothing - Wear shoes, socks, and long pants and long-sleeves. This type of protection may be necessary for people who must work in areas where mosquitoes are present.

Repellent - Apply mosquito repellent to bare skin and clothing.

Always use repellents according to the label. Repellents with DEET, picaridin, oil of lemon eucalyptus, para-menthane-diol, and IR3535 are effective.

Use mosquito netting to protect children younger than 2 months old.

Tips on Repellent Use
Always read [and follow- Mod.TG] label directions carefully for the approved usage before you apply a repellent. Some repellents are not suitable for children.

Products with concentrations of up to 30 percent DEET (N, N-diethyl-m-toluamide) are generally recommended. Other U.S. Environmental Protection Agency-approved repellents contain picaridin, oil of lemon eucalyptus, para-menthane-diol, or IR3535. These products are generally available at local pharmacies. Look for active ingredients to be listed on the product label.

Apply insect repellent to exposed skin, or onto clothing, but not under clothing.

In protecting children, read label instructions to be sure the repellent is age-appropriate. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), mosquito repellents containing oil of lemon eucalyptus should not be used on children under the age of 3 years. DEET is not recommended on children younger than 2 months old.

Avoid applying repellents to the hands of children. Adults should apply repellent 1st to their own hands and then transfer it to the child's skin and clothing.

If additional protection is necessary, apply a permethrin repellent directly to your clothing. Again, always follow the manufacturer's directions.

Cover doors and windows with screens to keep mosquitoes out of your house.

Repair broken screening on windows, doors, porches, and patios.

For more information on what repellent is right for you, consider using the Environmental Protection Agency's search tool to help you choose skin-applied repellent products.

The health department is continuing to conduct statewide surveillance for mosquito-borne illnesses, including West Nile virus infections, eastern equine encephalitis, St. Louis encephalitis, malaria, chikungunya, and dengue.

Residents of Florida are encouraged to report dead birds via the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission's site. For more information, visit DOH's website or contact your county health department.

[Eastern equine encephalitis is preventable by vaccination. Vaccine-produced immunity wanes in about 4 months, and, therefore, it is necessary to repeat the vaccine, especially in areas where the mosquito season is quite long, such as around coastal areas or large bodies of water, or even in areas with flood waters. The vaccine for EEE is usually combined with those for West Nile virus and western equine encephalitis, so it is a combination vaccine capable of preventing several of these illness in your equine friend.

The majority of this article seems to focus on notifying the public about the mosquito borne viruses that are in the Florida area and on ways for the public to protect itself. - Mod.TG
