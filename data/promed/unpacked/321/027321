TOP DIEBACK, SOYBEAN - USA (IOWA)

Over the past couple of weeks, we have had several reports and
soybean samples of top dieback. The last time we had a widespread
outbreak of this disease in Iowa was from 1997-1999. This season
[2007], the disease has been found in eastern and central Iowa.
Differences in susceptibility among varieties have been noticed. In
addition, affected plants are often defined by rows -- although
patches of top dieback, not unlike those you would expect to see with
soybean cyst nematode damage, have also been reported.
Top dieback symptoms are usually seen between late July and
mid-August when most soybean plants are in the reproductive phase.
Initial symptoms are characterized by yellowing and death of leaves
in the upper portion of the plant canopy, followed by discoloration
of internodes. Plants die prematurely when the disease is severe. An
Ohio study showed that fungal species belonging to the genera
_Phomopsis_ and _Diaporthe_, a group of plant pathogens that cause
various diseases in soybean, are associated with top dieback.
No systematic study has been carried out on this disease, and as a
result, we do not know when this disease strikes or what factors
contribute to its appearance. It has been speculated that potassium
deficiency may be associated with top dieback symptoms because they
somewhat resemble those of potassium deficiency. Several years ago,
it was observed in southern Iowa that the disease ceased after an
application of potassium. Soybean cyst nematodes are also frequently
found in these fields. In collaboration with Greg Tylka, who
specializes in plant-parasitic nematodes, we will be collecting soil
samples from affected and non-affected areas of a field showing top
dieback symptoms to investigate if there may be a relationship
between the 2 pathogens.
If top dieback is severe, consider changing soybean varieties for the
next growing season. Do not save seeds from fields with severe top
dieback because the pathogens causing it can be seedborne. If
necessary, soil and plant tissue analyses could be conducted to
ascertain the involvement of potassium deficiency in symptomatic fields.

[The _Diaporthe_/_Phomopsis_ fungal complex implicated in top dieback
shows wide genetic diversity and includes pathovars of great economic
importance to soybean cultivation. For example, northern and southern
stem canker, as well as pod and stem blight, are caused by different
pathovars of _Diaporthe phaseolorum_. Although fungi from this
species complex are commonly found in soybeans, pronounced symptoms
are not always present. These pathogens can overwinter in plant
residue and may be spread with infected seed and plant material.
In many cases, top dieback has also been reported to be associated
with soybean cyst nematode (SCN; _Heterodera glycines_), which is one
of the most destructive pathogens affecting soybeans. It commonly
causes yellowing and stunting of plants, which are often unevenly
distributed throughout the field.
