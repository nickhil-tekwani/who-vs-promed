The local health authority confirmed on Thursday [7 Jun 2007], that
11 people have contracted dengue fever and 2 more have tested
positive after a work-related trip to Southeast Asia.
The 13 were among 23 employees of a Guangzhou-based survey company
who left China in March [2007] to conduct preliminary surveys for a
hydropower project in a Southeast Asian country, said a spokesman at
the municipal health bureau. He refused to name the country.
Of the 13 employees, 11 suffered high fevers, joint pains, nausea,
and rashes between 11 Apr and 14 May [2007]. Some were diagnosed
abroad as having "malaria" and underwent treatment at local
hospitals, he said.
The company called back the group in 2 batches: 2 people arrived on
14 Apr and the other 21 on 30 May [2007]. Of the first 2 arrivals,
one came down with dengue fever on 16 Apr [2007] and the municipal
disease control and prevention center immediately launched an
investigation. The center found 12 of the 21 people arriving on 30
May [2007] carried the dengue-causing virus, and confirmed 10 had
just recovered from an infection. The other 2 positive cases showed
no symptoms of the disease.
The health bureau spokesman ruled out the possibility of the disease
spreading, as the most recent case on 14 May [2007] had recovered and
no suspected cases were reported in the past 3 weeks of observation.
The disease control and prevention center closely monitored the
health of the company staff, and helped eradicate mosquitoes around
its office building and employees' residences. Meanwhile, the city's
health bureau has told all local health, quarantine and inspection,
tourism and foreign trade authorities to be on heightened alert
against the potentially fatal, mosquito-borne disease.

[It would be interesting to know if _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes were
present in numbers prior to the mosquito control effort reported
here. It would also be interesting to know in which Southeast Asian
country the dengue fever virus infections were acquired.

Thailand's Ministry of Public Health announced on Thursday [7 Jun
2007] that the number of dengue fever patients nationwide has risen
to over 10 000 and 14 people have been killed by the dangerous
disease this year.
Until 7 June [2007], a total of 11 574 dengue fever patients, most of
them between 10-24 [years of age], have been found across the
country, especially in central, northeastern, and southern Thailand,
a public health official said.
The high-danger season of dengue fever is July but earlier-than-usual
rains has meant that dengue is a greater concern this year [2007]
than before, the official was quoted by local radio FM 100 as saying,
adding that the insurgency in the far South means that anti-mosquito
measures are more difficult to apply.
More breeding grounds for dengue-carrying mosquitoes emerge during
the rainy season, he explained, especially in the 3 southernmost
provinces, where heavier rainfall contributes to a higher population
of mosquitoes than in the country's other regions.
The Ministry of Public Health has ordered health officials to work
with local authorities to prevent the further spread of any outbreak.

Kuala Lumpur was 2nd on the list, with 127 cases, while Kelantan
[reported] 80. Johor, Kedah, Perak, Negeri Sembilan, and Sarawak
reported more dengue cases compared to the previous period.
"Dengue cases in Kuala Lumpur dropped from 145 to 127. Pahang,
Melaka, Sabah, and Terengganu also showed decreases," Dr Hassan said.
The Health Ministry has ordered all states and districts to activate
their operations rooms, he said.

Another dengue-related death has occurred, making it the 2nd case
this year [2007]. A 63-year-old man living in Hougang died last
Wednesday [6 Jun 2007], after being admitted into Tan Tock Seng
Hospital, the authorities said yesterday [10 Jun 2007]. The man had
sought medical attention for a fever from a general practitioner last
week, but his condition worsened and he was admitted to the hospital,
where he was tested and found to have an acute dengue [virus]
infection. He died from dengue shock syndrome, which also caused the
death of an 85-year-old man in April [2007].
The latest death occurred in a week when dengue infections were on
the rise again (293), compared to 227 cases the week before. The
number of active dengue clusters has also gone up to 54, 4 more than
last week. The most active areas are Jalan Songket, Aroozoo Avenue,
Boon Lay Drive, West Coast Drive, West Coast Road, Ho Ching Road, and
Tao Ching Road.
Some 2014 homes were found to be breeding mosquitoes between January
and May this year [2007] -- an increase of about 80 percent compared
to the same period last year [2006]. In addition, for every 1000
homes inspected by the NEA (National Environment Agency) in April and
May [2007], 6.3 and 5.6 homes respectively were found to be breeding
mosquitoes -- a sharp increase from February and March [2007], when
the figures were less than 2 for every 1000 homes inspected.
So far, 2472 cases of dengue infection have been reported this year
[2007], an 89 percent jump over the same period last year [2006].
Madam Halimah Yacob, the Government Parliamentary Committee Chairman
for Health, said that in spite of the efforts to promote the fight
against dengue, Singaporeans were still "complacent". "When we do
house visits, we have found cases of mosquitoes breeding in the same
homes, even though we have warned them before," she said. "People
still think they are invincible. We need people to understand that it
can really happen to them."

Dengue is looming large over Mumbai, as the city has recorded a spurt
in the number of dengue cases ahead of the monsoon season. Hospitals
in the suburbs of the metropolis have reported a large number of
fever cases; many of them diagnosed dengue hemorrhagic fever [DHF].
There is an alarming rise in the number of fever cases suspected to
be dengue in Mira-Bhayandar municipality area of Mumbai, blamed on
poor sanitation. "Mosquitoes breed because of stagnant water and
garbage that has piled up everywhere and this leads to the onset of
diseases like dengue," said Dr Ravi Patil of Sai Ashirwad Hospital.

[ProMED-mail would be interested in the numbers of dengue fever and
DHF cases in Mumbai, to get a better idea of the magnitude of the
dengue outbreak there.

The efficiency of the country in fighting dengue has worsened. In the
first 4 months of the year [2007], the number of cases of this
disease increased 20 percent compared to the number of cases during
the same period in 2006. There were 246 833 patients infected, of
which 288 were DHF (dengue hemorrhagic fever). There were 38 deaths,
between 10 and 15 percent more than in the same period last year
[2006].
Concerned for this increase, a group of consultants from the Pan
American Health Organization (PAHO) will travel to Brazil in July
[2007] to analyze the [government's] plan to combat dengue.
Fabiano Pimenta, acting secretary for Health Surveillance [Ministry
of Health], indicated that the increase in cases this year [2007] is
due to the combination of 2 factors: an increase in the intensity and
duration of rainfall and the explosion of cases in Mato Grosso do
Sul: 68 000 cases, just this year [2007]. "In the state, there have
been a large number of [mosquito] breeding sites, and the people have
no immunity to dengue [virus type] 3. This has produced an explosion
of cases." he observed.
Pimenta recognized, however, that in other localities where the
population was also susceptible to dengue [virus type] 3 the epidemic
could be contained. This was the case in Minas Gerais. "it is an
example that, with good field work and the cooperation of the people,
it is possible to avoid an explosive number of cases," he affirmed.
