The patient travelled with her partner from Yangon to Lake Inle, then Mandalay and Bagan. The patient remembered the consumption of milk and lassi (typical Indian dairy product) only in Mandalay. Her partner did not drink it and is not infected with brucella. Blood culture is underway with prolonged incubation.

Brucella IgM-Ab titer is very high. Low IgG-level (2-fold above normal). The case looks like an acute infection. Clinical symptoms were undulating fever up to 40 C., with night sweats and weakness. If blood culture is successful the species could be identified. I will inform you.
