According to the state veterinarian 3 cows from a northwest Wyoming
cattle herd have initially tested positive for brucellosis.

Dr Jim Logan said in a media release this morning [27 Oct 2010] his
agency was notified by the Wyoming State Veterinary Laboratory that
blood from the 3 cows reacted to tests for brucellosis. The cows are
from a single herd in Park County.

Brucellosis is a bacterial disease that can cause cattle, elk, and
bison to abort their calves.

Scientists believe the area around Yellowstone National Park in
northwest Wyoming contains the last remaining reservoirs of the
disease. The disease can be transmitted from wildlife to cattle.

Logan said reactors on blood tests do not absolutely prove that
cattle are infected with brucellosis. However, Logan said the
reactors were very strong indicators that the likelihood of infection is high.

Tissue and blood samples were collected from the 3 cows and submitted
to the state lab for a full diagnostic evaluation. Tests results may
take up to 2 weeks to complete.

The presence of the disease within the herd -- if confirmed through
further testing -- could result in additional testing requirements
and strict adherence to quarantine procedures to keep Wyoming from
losing its federal brucellosis-free status.

[This area around Cody, Wyoming is adjacent to Yellowstone National
Park, where spillover from infected bison and elk herds has been a
major road block in the effort to eradicate brucellosis from the
national cattle herd. The area can be seen on the
