Dog owners are being warned to be vigilant about a deadly infection their pet can catch just by playing in the garden, as numbers rise.

Dogs could be at risk of serious illness from the increasingly common lungworm disease which can be caused by the animals eating garden slugs, a leading vet charity says.

As slug numbers increase thanks to recent warm, wet weather, families at home are being asked to be mindful of the increased risk of lungworm when letting dogs play in back gardens during the coronavirus lockdown.

Up to now, there have been at least 48 cases of lungworm reported across south Essex, including 17 in Southend and 12 in the Rayleigh area.

A spokesman for Earl's Hall Veterinary Group, which has branches in Shoebury, Ashingdon and Eastwood, said calls had been received from concerned dog owners, but staff were not aware of any cases. However, its website says vets are reporting significantly more cases of dogs with the disease.

It adds: "The worm is known to favour warmer temperatures. Foxes can also be infected, and the increase in urban fox populations might be another reason why vets are seeing more cases in dogs, as infected foxes spread worm larvae in their poo. Infestations of this lungworm often result in death if not diagnosed, or if left untreated. Early diagnosis by a vet, followed by appropriate treatment will, fortunately, usually lead to a full recovery. Canine angiostrongylus is a life-threatening disease of dogs caused by a very sophisticated worm."

The average British garden contains up to 20 000 slugs and snails and, following warmer winter temperatures, that number is likely to increase.

The worm is called _Angiostrongylus vasorum_, often referred to as lungworm or French heartworm due to its discovery in France in 1866.

Pharmaceutical company Bayer has set up a map showing how much of a concern it is in any specific area around the country.

[_Angiostrongylus vasorum_, also known as French heartworm, is a metastrongylid nematode parasite that resides in the pulmonary arteries and right ventricle of dogs and other canids. The presence of the parasite has been reported in Europe, Africa, South America, and Canada. The widely accepted view on red foxes as reservoir of _A. vasorum_ has recently been addressed (Ref. 1). Juvenile red foxes were found to be fully susceptible, although severe clinical disease was not observed. Infections in red foxes appear to be chronic and, moreover, to resemble infections in dogs. The red fox is thus a suitable model as well as a natural reservoir for the parasite.

Although clinical signs in association with _A. vasorum_ infection in dogs can be variable, they typically represent 3 main syndromes: cardiorespiratory signs, coagulopathies, and neurological dysfunction. The disease is increasingly diagnosed in dogs, as the geographic range of the parasite increases along with awareness among clinicians. Diagnosis, treatment, and prevention are not always straightforward, although recent developments offer hope for improved options in future. Understanding of the epidemiology and pathogenesis remains poor.

Clinician awareness is an important defense against this disease, which can be severe and difficult to diagnose definitively. Although the pathogenesis is not fully understood, and current tests for parasitological diagnosis suffer from poor sensitivity, signs associated with infection are well described and should alert clinicians to the possibility of infection. Climatic models suggest that there is substantial scope for further geographical spread, so practitioners in areas not currently considered endemic should be vigilant.

There are effective drugs for the treatment of _A. vasorum_, and early anthelmintic [anti-parasite] therapy of uncomplicated respiratory cases of mild or moderate severity has excellent prognosis for full recovery. More severe or unusual presentations, including bleeding disorders, can present a greater challenge. Regular anthelmintic treatment is likely to reduce, but might not eliminate, the risk of disease.
