Anthrax investigators hope to learn where exposure occurred
-----------------------------------------------------------
An investigation into the origins of Minnesota's 1st human anthrax
case in many years is focusing on where the patient might have been
exposed to the deadly pathogen, Minnesota state epidemiologist Dr Ruth
Lynfield said today [10 Aug 2011].

The Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) announced yesterday that a
person who had recently traveled through North Dakota, South Dakota,
Montana, and Wyoming was being treated for inhalational anthrax in a
Minnesota hospital. Officials said the case was apparently caused by
naturally occurring anthrax in the environment. The MDH has not
revealed the patient's condition or listed any identifying details
such as name, gender, home state, or hospital.

Lynfield said today that the patient had been on a "multi-week trip"
and was sick on arrival in Minnesota after traveling through the 4
western states. "Anthrax is in the environment in the soil in all
these places, so it's hard to know for sure" where the exposure might
have occurred, she said. "We're trying to go through the [travel]
itinerary. We'll be learning more, but at this point what we know is
that the person was in a place where anthrax does cause disease in
animals," she said. She noted that the disease strikes cattle and
wildlife such as bison and deer. She also said officials are looking
into whether the patient has any risk factors that could have made him
or her more susceptible to inhalational anthrax.

Lynfield noted that floods can move _Bacillus anthracis_, the
bacterium that causes anthrax, in the soil, leading to animal
outbreaks. "One thing we're doing now is checking in with various
wildlife groups and veterinarians to try to determine if there's
anything going on this summer [2011]," she said. She said Minnesota
has not had a confirmed human anthrax case in "decades," and
neighboring states have not had any recent cases, either.

Because of the potential for bioterrorist use of anthrax, the Federal
Bureau of Investigation (FBI) initially collaborated with the MDH to
investigate the case, the MDH said yesterday. The FBI ended its
involvement after concluding there was no evidence of terrorist or
criminal activity, officials said.

Lynfield declined to describe the patient's condition today. "There
was a rumor that the patient had died -- that's just a rumor," she
said. She noted that the patient's family has had bad experiences with
the news media in the past and has asked the MDH to protect its
privacy.

Inhalational anthrax is the most deadly form of the disease. Anthrax
spores that were sent by mail to several media offices and 2 US
senators' offices in 2001 sickened 22 people, killing 5 of them.

[A number of people have contacted me commenting that the 2001 letter
attack started with Bob Stevens falling ill on 29 Sep 2001, while
travelling; he died on 5 Oct 2001. A seemingly random event. One can
take some comfort in that the FBI were informed immediately and have
told MDH that they are not concerned. It is now up to Dr Lynfield to
sort out this conundrum.

The only reliable soil-related human cases I know of were in Bulgaria
when a bunch of guys were salvaging steel from a derelict Soviet
automobile factory and dug through a cattle grave that had been snuck
in there for some reason, and those were all cutaneous cases. The
Soviets reported a number of soil based cases over the years but this
was because it was a felony to butcher anthrax carcasses and the
farmers covered themselves by denying any livestock deaths and
insisting that they had only been sowing crops.

As of now I have not heard of any livestock anthrax cases in Montana,
Wyoming, North and South Dakota, or Minnesota. But that is not to say
that they might have occurred but have not been observed. - Mod.MHJ]
