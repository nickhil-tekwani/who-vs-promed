Tiger mosquitoes [_Aedes albopictus_] have been found in 5 Dutch municipalities so far this year [2021] -- in Amstelveen, Assen, Lelystad, Moerdijk, and Sittard. In addition, a number of yellow fever mosquitoes [_Ae. aegypti_] have been found in Haarlemmermeer (Schiphol), reported the foundation platform Stop invasive exotics, which keeps track of the mosquito figures. The foundation relies on data from the Dutch Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority (NVWA).

The tiger mosquito and yellow fever mosquito are animals that do not originate in the Netherlands. They can spread various viral diseases in humans and animals, such as dengue, Zika, chikungunya, yellow fever, West Nile virus, and various forms of encephalitis. The critters probably came along with imported car tires and bamboo plants.

NVWA states on its website where and when the exotic mosquitoes were found. How many mosquitoes were found per find will be announced at the end of the year.

Last year [2020] tiger mosquitoes were found in 10 municipalities and yellow fever mosquitoes in 2 places -- 585 tiger mosquitoes and 34 yellow fever mosquitoes.

The tiger mosquito is a lot smaller than an ordinary mosquito and has black and white stripes. The yellow fever mosquito, which stings mainly during the day, is 3 to 4 millimeters in size. This exotic mosquito is dark colored and has white stripes on the legs.

[_Aedes albopictus_ and _Ae. aegypti_ continue to spread in Europe. There is no mention in the report above about attempts to control or eradicate them in the Netherlands.

The distribution of _Ae. albopictus_ in Europe can be accessed at https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/aedes-albopictus-current-known-distribution-march-2021 and _Ae. aegypti_ at https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/aedes-aegypti-current-known-distribution-march-2021.

This is not the 1st time that _Ae. albopictus_ has been found in the Netherlands. In 2010, eggs and larvae of this mosquito were found in imported used tires in Brabant. In 2013, they were found in Oss, Weert, Montfort, Almere, Lelystad, Emmeloord, and Harderberg but were eliminated (see ProMED-mail Aedes albopictus - Netherlands 20130817.1885955). They were present in 2018 in Eindhoven, Weert, Amstelveen, Assen, and Almere and in 2020 in 10 locations. It is very unlikely that _Ae. albopictus_ is sufficiently abundant to permit ongoing transmission of dengue, chikungunya, or Zika viruses should they be introduced by travelers from countries where the viruses are currently being transmitted. Nevertheless, elimination of these mosquitoes is prudent.

One does not know if the eggs of _Ae. albopictus_ found in various localities in the Netherlands are capable of going into physiologically inactive diapause and surviving winter temperatures. The Netherlands has a maritime climate, and winter temperatures may not fall much below 0 deg C (32 deg F). _Ae. albopictus_ can survive in considerably colder conditions, such as those in the Midwestern states of the USA. Although this mosquito is present now in these localities in the Netherlands, it is not considered to have become established there. - Mod.TY
