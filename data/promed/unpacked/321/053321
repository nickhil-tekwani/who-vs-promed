On Sunday, 31 Dec 2006, afternoon we were informed about numerous
mortalities in 2-3 week-old (goat) kids, in Moshav (cooperative village)
Netu'a on the Lebanese frontier. The affected flock includes 280 adult
goats and 220 kids, of which 90 died within several days.
Suspected material was sent to the department of virology in the Kimron
Veterinary Institute, Beit-Dagan. Next day, Monday, 1 Jan 2007, it was
found to be infected with FMDV serotype O.
Moshav Netu'a has been declared infected.

[The above preliminary information has been e-mailed to the Israeli
veterinary profession and to the farming industry in practically real-time
mode, simultaneously with its official notification to authorities within
and outside Israel, including the OIE.
Past experience has contributed to the established alertness of Israeli
vets and sheep/goat breeders to the possibility that mass mortality in
young lambs and kids might be caused by FMDV (diagnostically compatible
with enterotoxaemia/struck, among others).
For the location of Netu'a see square 2 in the interactive map

The Middle East is one of the heaviest FMD-infected regions on globe, with
seroytypes O and A as the predominant virus types, with FMDV Asia 1
occasionally present. Exceptional incursions of African serotypes (FMDV
SAT1, SAT2) have been recorded in the past as well (e.g. Libya, 1993).
Although Israel exercises a severe policy to prevent the introduction of
FMD, particularly to protect its record-yielding dairy cattle (national
production means in 2006 exceeding 11 000 kg milk/cow, with about 100 000
cows in lactation), outbreaks of FMD have been recorded during 15 out of
the 24 years between 1982 and 2005. This included only one outbreak in a
dairy farm.
Since the early 1970's, the most prevalent serotype recorded in Israel has
been FMDV-0, found in cattle, sheep, goats, gazelles, pigs and wild
boars. FMDV serotype A22 has not been seen in Israel since its last
recording in 1981. FMDV serotype Asia 1 has been last recorded during 1984
and 1989, infecting beef (2 herds) and dairy (1 herd) cattle. Serotype
SAT-1 was last recorded in 1962.
A remarkable feature of FMD in Israel is its seasonality (in large and
small ruminants). First (primary) cases during the season usually appear in
December - February, and if spreading, the peak of the epizootic will be
seen in April-June (70-75 percent of all annual totals). Since 1974, not a
single case has been recorded in November. The reasons for that puzzling
phenomenon have not been clarified so far. About 70 percent of primary
outbreaks of FMD in Israel are seen in areas adjacent to the northern
frontiers, bordering Lebanon and Syria. The current outbreak is --
geographically, chronologically, and apparently also virologically
(serotype O) -- not exceptional.
The Israeli FMD vaccination scheme includes annual vaccination of all
cattle over the age of 3 months during October to December, applying a
trivalent oil-emulsion vaccine (01, A22, Asial). During 2006, the following
strains were included in the vaccine: O1 Geshur 85; O1 Manisa; O1 3039; A22
Iraq 87; A Iran 96; Asia 1 Shamir.
Booster vaccination is carried out in cattle younger than 18 months, 8 to
12 weeks after their initial vaccination. Calves born after the general
vaccination period are vaccinated when 3 months old within a secondary
scheme. The timing of the mass vaccinations has been planned in an attempt
to confer maximal immunity level at the commencement of the "FMD season",
namely January-April.
Vaccination also involves the entire national sheep and goat population
with a monovalent FMDV-0 oil-emulsion vaccine, though without the booster
vaccinations in cattle. Livestock owners are obliged, by law, to pay for
the vaccination which is carried out by personnel of the State Veterinary
Service. During 2005, about 480 000 vaccinations (including revaccinations)
have been carried out in cattle and 760 000 in small ruminants (mainly
sheep). Data for 2006 have not yet been published, but may be expected to
have been of similar magnitude.
Additional data, including the vaccination status of the affected flock and
possible additional clinical symptoms, are anticipated. - Mod.AS]
