If appropriate, I would like to contribute to the discussion of
malaria prophylaxis that has followed the military outbreak in
Liberia. I have been treating ex-pats and nationals in West Africa
[Ivory Coast and Mali] regularly since 1991. I agree heartily with
the idea that short-term residents deserve chemoprophylaxis. I would
like to take exception to some of the assumptions concerning
long-term residents.
It may be assumed that long-term residents know about the disease and
how to treat it, but I do not feel this assumption is justified.
Expatriates as well as nationals are quick to attribute many various
symptoms to malaria and to apply all manner of treatments, standard
and otherwise, to such symptoms. What results is a body of so-called
knowledge concerning non-standard approaches to the treatment of
vague symptom complexes, which is hardly helpful.
What is indeed unfortunate is that real knowledge is much harder to
come by. There are few if any trials to guide us in applying anything
like evidence-based medicine to the problem of malaria
chemoprophylaxis of long-term overseas residents.
Anecdotally, I can say that long-term ex-pat residents of West Africa
are susceptible to death from malaria, and while the risk is greater
in children below 6 years of age, it can strike individuals of any
age. Also anecdotally, I have heard of few reports of people who
contracted fatal malaria while on a widely accepted chemoprophylaxis.
Almost all had had the diagnosis of malaria made prior to death.
Until adequate trials provide guidance, I would argue that long-term
as well as short-term residents should carefully evaluate the need
for malaria chemoprophylaxis.

[I entirely agree with Tim Herrick's comments and what I was trying
to say in my previous comment was that long-term residents are a
special group who need special considerations. I agree that the
perceived knowledge is not the same as actual knowledge, but there
are special problems when someone is a permanent resident for many
years in malarious areas; no matter how well we argue for
prophylaxis, this group drifts towards self-treatment and tends to
abolish regular prophylaxis as time passes. I agree that the price is
increased mortality. Healthy residents seeking advice on malaria
prophylaxis are not patients but merely use physicians as
consultants; in the end they make their own decisions, whether we
agree with them or not. - Mod.EP]
