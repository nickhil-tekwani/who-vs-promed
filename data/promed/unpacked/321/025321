Test results made public Monday [14 Mar 2011] show the hot water
system in Miami Valley Hospital's new 12-story addition harbored
_Legionella_ bacteria, increasing the likelihood that contaminated
water there had a role in an outbreak of Legionnaires' disease that
sickened 11 hospital patients.

The hospital said tests also showed superheating and
hyperchlorinating the water system were effective in eliminating the
bacteria, which are common in the environment. "I can assure our
patients, staff and the public that measures we have put into place
show that the water is safe for drinking, bathing and washing,"
hospital Chief Executive and President Bobbie Gerhart said in a
prepared statement. She declined to be interviewed.

The outbreak, which began in February [2011], is the largest reported
in Ohio since 2004. The hospital temporarily shut down the addition's
water system last month [February 2011] after identifying a cluster
of 4 cases of Legionnaires' disease. Hospital officials suspected the
_Legionella_ bacteria colonized during construction of the USD 135
million tower, which began admitting patients 28 Dec 2011. The water
system was flushed prior to occupancy.

The death certificate of the sole patient who had Legionnaires'
disease and died lists pneumonia as a contributing factor in the
man's death. Legionnaires' disease is a form of pneumonia, but the
death certificate does not specifically list Legionnaires' disease.
The 73-year-old Dayton man died 22 Feb 2011. The death certificate
shows the cause of death was a "myocardial infarction," a cardiac
condition in which there is death of a group of cells or tissue in
the myocardium, the heart's middle layer. The man's son could not be
reached for comment Monday [14 Mar 2011]. The physician who completed
the death certificate, Randall Marino Fulchiero, declined comment
about the death certificate through an office spokeswoman, citing
patient privacy concerns.

[The number of cases of legionellosis has increased from 9 to 11
since the last ProMED-mail post (Legionellosis, nosocomial - USA
(02): (OH) 20110310.0775) and _Legionella_ (although the species is
not identified) has now been isolated from the hot water system of
the hospital's new addition. The news release, however, does not
indicate if genotyping has been done. Genotyping the environmental
and clinical isolates, if any, would confirm or refute linkage of
cases to the contaminated water supply (1,2). For a discussion of
legionellosis, please see the prior ProMED-mail post Legionellosis,
nosocomial - USA: (OH) 20110303.0692.
