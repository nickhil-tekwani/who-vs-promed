DIPHTHERIA, LABORATORY ACCIDENT - UK

Throat infection with toxigenic _Corynebacterium diphtheriae_ acquired in a
laboratory.
An experienced medical laboratory scientific officer (MLSO) became infected
with a toxigenic strain of _Corynebacterium diphtheriae_ while handling a
sample distributed by the National External Quality Assessment Scheme
(NEQAS) for microbiology in November 1997. Laboratories were informed that
this sample came from a patient with a severe sore throat who had recently
returned from Russia. The MLSO already had a sore throat and a cold when
preparing a heavy suspension of organisms on the open bench for biochemical
tests. The MLSO developed severe tonsillitis seven days after setting up
these tests. A toxigenic strain of _C. diphtheriae_ var gravis was isolated
from a throat swab. The MLSO was treated with penicillin for two weeks, and
a second throat swab taken after completion of treatment was negative.
Blood taken eight days after onset of illness contained 0.1 International
Units per ml diphtheria antitoxin antibody, which is sufficient to protect
against the toxic manifestations of _C. diphtheriae_ infection.
Two consultants in communicable disease managed this incident, one for the
area where the laboratory is sited, and the other for the area where the
MLSO lives. Throat swabs were taken from close contacts of the MLSO and all
the other laboratory staff. They were all negative. A booster dose of
diphtheria toxoid was given to all laboratory staff.
The strain isolated from the MLSO was sent to the PHLS Streptococcus and
Diphtheria Reference Unit at the Central Public Health Laboratory for
toxigenicity testing, further characterisation, and ribotyping. It was
found to be indistinguishable from the strain sent out in the NEQAS
distribution, which had been isolated from a throat swab taken from a
patient in Kazakhstan. It is recommended that people who may be exposed to
diphtheria in the course of their work be fully immunised and their levels
of antibody tested at least three months after completion of immunisation.
Booster doses should be given at intervals of 10 years. Immunisation
protects people from the effects of the toxin, but it will not necessarily
prevent acquisition and carriage of _C. diphtheriae_. Appropriate working
practices are required to protect staff from acquiring infection in the
laboratory and subsequently transmitting it to others. The PHLS recommends
that when staff handle suspected _C. diphtheriae_ and _Neisseria
meningitidis_ isolates, procedures likely to generate aerosols should be
carried out in a safety cabinet.
