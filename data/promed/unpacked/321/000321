A black bear in coastal North Carolina tested positive for rabies this month [December 2018], making it the 1st known case of the fatal disease in a bear in state history, wildlife officials said.

The year-old bear was lethargic and having trouble moving when [JD] spotted the animal at his game feeder in Fairfield on 16 Dec 2018. Just a day later, [JD] found the bear dead at the same location and called wildlife officials, the North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission said in a news release Friday [28 Dec 2018].

It wasn't obvious what had killed the bear in Hyde County, so wildlife staff did a necropsy and then sent the animal's body to University of Georgia researchers for more testing. Researchers told the wildlife commission on 21 Dec 2018 that the bear had tested positive for rabies, and that the deadly virus was the cause of death, the commission said.

"Rabies in wild black bears is extremely rare," Colleen Olfenbuttel, the state wildlife commission's black bear biologist, said in a statement. "It has been documented only 4 times in the lower 48 states since 1999."

Black bears are the only bears calling the East Coast home, and they roam in about 60% of North Carolina, according to the wildlife commission. There were roughly 17 000 bears in the state as of 2012.

Rabies is more common in other, smaller mammals, such as skunks, raccoons, bats, and even household pets. Vaccinating pets against the fatal disease is required under North Carolina law.

Any mammal -- humans included -- can catch the deadly rabies virus. Rabies is "by far the most prevalent" animal-borne disease in North Carolina, according to the state health department.

"You can only get rabies by coming in direct contact with the saliva, tears, or brain/nervous tissue of an infected animal," Olfenbuttel said.

Humans who come into contact with an animal they suspect could have the virus should get treated as quickly as possible. As soon as symptoms start to appear, rabies is nearly always deadly, according to Mayo Clinic.

The lethargy and trouble moving the bear exhibited is the result of brain inflammation caused by the viruses, according to the commission. Rabies also leads to loss of balance, fever, and nose and eye discharge. As the disease gets worse, an animal's head, eyelids, tongue, and neck can begin to swell, and its mouth may begin to foam. Other signs include difficulty swallowing and breathing, vomiting, self-mutilation, paralysis, and aggression.

The wildlife commission urges anyone who spots a black bear that is dead or exhibiting those symptoms to call its helpline at 866-318-2401 during weekday business hours or 800-662-7137 on weekends.

The North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission offers these recommendations for bear hunters:

- Do not handle or eat any animal that is acting abnormal or appears to be sick;
- Wear latex or rubber gloves when field dressing; never handle a dead animal with your bare hands;
- Minimize the handling of the brain and spinal cord;
- Do not allow pets around your field dressing area to prevent contact with saliva, blood, and other tissues;
- Wash hands, boots, and instruments thoroughly after field dressing is completed;
- If a deer or bear is commercially processed, request the animal be processed individually and without meat from other animals; and
- Use proper cooking temperatures to ensure safe food.

[We do not get many reported cases of rabies in bears. However, any mammal -- bears to bovines, dogs to deer, raccoons to rabbits -- can get rabies.

Any time an animal is acting unusual, rabies should be on the differential list. Rabies may be the furious form, as when the animal is aggressive and often salivating. However, the dumb form may affect animals in the opposite fashion, meaning they can be quiet and withdrawn. They may or may not be salivating.

Any hunter should use gloves while field dressing the harvest. While post-exposure prophylaxis is available for humans, it is most effective if obtained quickly after exposure. A small cut on the hunter's hand while field dressing an animal that is incubating the disease could lead to the death of the hunter, who may not realize the animal is incubating the deadly disease.
