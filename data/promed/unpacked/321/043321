Background
Twenty-three (23)* cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type-2 (cVDPV2) have been confirmed in Syria -- 22 cases are from Mayadeen (Al Mayadin) district, Deir Ez-Zor (Dayr Az Zawr) governorate, and 1 case from Tell Abyad district, Raqqa (Ar Raqqah) governorate. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on [28 May 2017].

*Situation report number 3, dated [4 Jul 2017], indicated a total of 24 cVDPV2 cases as part of this outbreak. Specimens collected from a Raqqa district AFP case have been retested as per standard practice and 2ary testing showed negative results for poliovirus isolation. The case was thus discarded, bringing the total number of confirmed cases down to 23.

The total number of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) cases detected in Deir Ez-Zor governorate since the beginning of 2017 is 81 (63 from Mayadeen, 10 from Deir Ez-Zor, and 8 from Boukamal districts). Raqqa governorate has reported 12 AFP cases (5 from Raqqa, 6 from Tell Abyad, and 1 from Thawra districts) since the beginning of the year [2017].

Key highlights
Monovalent type-2 oral polio vaccine (mOPV2) was shipped to Deir Ez-Zor governorate on [11 Jul 2017]. The 1st immunization campaign round in Deir Ez-Zor is expected to commence [22 Jul 2017].

An mOPV2 campaign in affected areas of Raqqa governorate is now planned.

MoH has dispatched 350 vaccine carriers to Deir Ez-Zor. UNICEF is providing 2 solar fridges to support vaccine cold chain during campaign implementation.

A 2-day training workshop for field staff from Raqqa will be conducted this week in Damascus, during which micro-plans and accessibility maps will be updated.

Training for community mobilizers in Deir Ez-Zor is planned for [12-15 Jul 2017].

[The above report rules out the 2nd case of presumed cVDPV associated polio in Raqqah that was reported in the last update (see Poliomyelitis update (16): Pakistan (BA), global 20170706.5155739 and Poliomyelitis update (15): Syria (RA) new case, Pakistan, violence 20170705.5153696 for more details on this now discarded case).

New information in this report includes the mention of 81 AFP cases reported from Deir-al-Zour governorate and 12 from the Raqqah governorate. Hence, it is highly likely that there will be more cases confirmed in the coming weeks. Also, the planned start date for the response is now 22 Jul 2017.

A good map showing the locations of the confirmed cases in addition to graphic representations of the outbreak as well as further details on the planned response activities over the coming weeks can be found at the original WHO/UNICEF situation report page available at: http://www.emro.who.int/images/stories/syria/WHO_UNICEF_Situation_Report_4_cVDPV2_outbreak_Syria_12.7.2017.pdf.
