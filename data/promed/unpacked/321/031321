During the 1st weeks of 2016, the Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut (FLI) detected further cases of variegated squirrel 1 bornavirus (VSBV-1) in pet squirrels from zoos and breeders. Variegated squirrels as well as several species of the subfamily Callosciurinae were affected. Therefore, the FLI recommends testing of all pet squirrels for the virus.

Studies indicate a zoonotic character of VSBV-1 and that 3 breeders have been infected by their variegated squirrels. At present it is unclear whether VSBV-1 also occurs in other animal species. Investigations to identify other susceptible species and establish the origins of the pathogen are being carried out by the FLI.

So far, all VSBV-1 infected squirrels have been detected in Saxony-Anhalt, Saxony, Schleswig-Holstein, North Rhine-Westphalia, or Lower Saxony. It is currently unclear if the animals were infected in Germany or if the pathogen was introduced into Germany due to the importation of infected animals. The transmission routes of VSBV-1 between squirrels and to humans are still unknown. Direct transmission through scratches or bites is most likely.

Further information on VSBV-1 and details on sampling/shipping of samples are provided in a profile on the FLI website under Animal Disease Information/Bornavirus. http://tinyurl.com/zbsz4eg

[Borna disease is described mainly in association with natural infections of horses and sheep, in which BoDV (Borna disease virus) has a main tropism for the CNS (central nervous system). The infection is noncytolytic and persistent, and in the natural hosts, mood, sensorium, sensibility, motility, and the autonomous nervous system are simultaneously or successively affected, with a fatal outcome in up to 90 percent of infected animals. For epidemiological and zoonotic aspects of BoDV, see references.
