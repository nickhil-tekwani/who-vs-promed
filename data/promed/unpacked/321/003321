DRC: Suspected Plague Kills 58 in Ituri
-----------------------------------------
Health officials in the Democratic Republic of the Congo said on Thu,
29 Jul 2004, 58 people, suspected to have caught the plague, had died
so far this year in the northeastern district of Ituri.
They were among the 1042 suspected plague cases recorded since Jan
2004, according to a joint Ministry of Health and WHO mission sent to
the area from 18-26 Jul 2004.
"Ituri remains the area in the DRC most affected by plague because of
incessant population displacements caused by the continued fighting
between rebel groups," Dr Vital Mondonge Makuma, deputy director of
the Epidemiological Surveillance Unit at the Ministry of Health, said.
The mission reported that most of the cases occurred in Mahagi
Territory, 140 km north east of Bunia, within Ituri District.
With 517 suspected cases of the disease recorded, the health zone of
Rethy is the hardest hit: 31 deaths were registered there from Jan to
May 2004. During the same period, the Logo zone registered 340
suspected cases and 15 deaths; Rimba 183 suspected cases and 10
deaths; and Nyarambe 2 deaths.
"Even if we can no longer call this a severe outbreak, cases continue
to be reported with a 5.5 percent mortality rate," Mondonge said.
Dr Jean-Marie Yameogo of WHO Kinshasa told IRIN on Thu, 29 Jul 2004:
"Even though the region has been a hot spot for the plague since
1928, the absence of proper laboratory facilities in Ituri has made
it impossible to confirm scientifically that those infected are
indeed suffering from plague."
The mission's report shows that 90 percent of the cases are suspected
to be bubonic plague, 7 percent pulmonary plague, while 3 percent are
suspected to be septicemic.
Dr Tarcis Elongo of WHO Bunia told IRIN that one of the factors
encouraging the epidemic was the climate. "The high humidity during
the rainy season forces [people] to store their food indoors, and
this attracts rats and [their] fleas that are carriers of the
disease," He said. "The fact that people are forced to live in the
bush during fighting has also contributed to its spread."
