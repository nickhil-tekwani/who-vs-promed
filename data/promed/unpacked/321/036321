Since September this year [2011], several animals in the Lower Zambezi
National Park [LZNP] and Chiawa Game Management Area [CGMA] (up to the
Nyamangwe River) [The CGMA adjoins the LZNP. - Mod.MHJ] have died from
a disease called anthrax. There have been various mortalities recorded
-- hippo (100+), elephant (17), baboon (2), and kudu (7). Anthrax is a
natural disease that can affect both animals and humans. All
warm-blooded animals can catch the disease.

Conservation Lower Zambezi, an organisation that aims to protect the
environment of the Lower Zambezi as an asset for the people of Zambia,
were quick to respond to the crisis. They have partnered with the
Zambia Wildlife Authority (ZAWA) to ensure the loss of wildlife is as
minimal as possible. They are also working hard to educate the local
community about the disease, and the prevention measures that need to
be taken.

Several vets from the Department of Veterinary Services have visited
the Lower Zambezi National Park to formulate a response to the
outbreak both in regards to wildlife, and also importantly with
regards to the local communities. Dr Ian Parsons has been involved
with protecting the lion population from anthrax. Lions were severely
at risk over the past months but the outbreak has now been totally
treated. This fast response has ensured that no lions have been lost
to the disease. At this stage it is likely that the lions have
developed a natural immunity to the disease due to their exposure.

Conservation Lower Zambezi has played an important role in responding
to this anthrax crisis and has been instrumental in educating the
people in Lower Zambezi about the outbreak. The length of the outbreak
can depend on many factors including animal population densities. In
this instance, the start of the rains is likely to bring the outbreak
to a natural halt.

[2] Zambia, Zimbabwe (Zambezi Valley): human, wildlife

More than 40 animals in game parks along the Zambezi Valley have died
over the past 2 months following a suspected anthrax outbreak that has
also affected Zambia [see [1] above] where about 230 people reportedly
contracted the disease. 33 hippopotamuses, 8 lions, 2 buffaloes,
impalas, and birds were found dead on the Zimbabwean side after the
flooding Zambezi River subsided.

The Parks and Wildlife Management Authority of Zimbabwe has since
dispatched samples to the University of Zimbabwe Veterinary Services
Department and South Africa for tests. The test results could not be
obtained by last week.

The director-general of the authority, Mr Vitalis Chadenga, said
preliminary indications showed that anthrax could be responsible for
the deaths. "Indications are that the animals died of anthrax. We are
working with the University of Zimbabwe Veterinary Services Department
in conducting tests," he said.

Rangers discovered the 1st carcasses in September [2011]. More were
later found along the valley where they are suspected to have died
unnoticed. Initially, reports suggested poachers were poisoning
drinking pans in order to get elephant tusks. However, the giant
mammals that died were not dismembered. When The Sunday Mail visited
Hambakwe Forest near Makuti, about 77 km [about 50 mi] from Kariba,
last week, elephant carcasses were strewn all over. Several vultures
that had fed on the contaminated flesh lay next to them. Most of the
hippos were found dead in the Zambezi River.

Mr Chadenga said the deaths showed distinct traces of the deadly
anthrax disease. "The pattern of deaths is very much suggestive of
anthrax bacterial mortality," he said. "Mortality appeared to have
followed soon after floods in the Zambezi River subsided. Laboratory
tests are under way in this country and in South Africa."

Last month [October 2011], reports from Zambia said more than 230
suspected cases were detected in humans. All the patients either ate
or touched diseased hippo meat. The source of the outbreak was
believed to be a population of hippos in the Luangwa River where 62
animals died after showing signs of _Bacillus anthracis_ infection.
Laboratory results were positive.

The authorities promptly cordoned off Chama district [Eastern Province
of Zambia] where the cases were reported. Apart from confiscating and
destroying the hippo meat and carcasses, they also increased
surveillance and community education.

[A disease epidemic on both sides of a river and thus in 2 separate
responsibilities is always illuminating. It is interesting that the
Zambian lions were unaffected but the Zimbabwe lions were. The extent
of the Zambian hippo losses makes me think that maybe the ascribed
benefit of a rapid response protecting the Zambian lions might have
been aided by exposures in previous years. Lions are subject to
anthrax, like other felidae, and the lesions are frequently
oropharyngeal.

I await the Zimbabwe results with interest. Vultures are not
susceptible to anthrax though one can frequently recover viable spores
from their faeces: see MD Saggese, et al: First detection of _Bacillus
anthracis_ in feces of free ranging raptors from central Argentina, J
Wildl Dis. 2007; 43(1): 136-41;
http://www.jwildlifedis.org/content/43/1/136.long.
Also, Hugh-Jones M, Blackburn J: The ecology of _Bacillus anthracis_.
Mol Aspects Med. 2009; 30(6): 356-67;
http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mam.2009.08.003. And over the years
having watched countless vultures feed on many anthrax carcasses in
west Texas and not found one dead vulture, I can confirm their solid
resistance.

So I expect that there could well have been a coincident elephant
poisoning programme by Zimbabwe ivory poachers. It is not without
interest that the dead vultures were found next to the dead elephants.
It might be worth revisiting these elephant carcasses at Makuti, 77 km
(about 50 mi) from Kariba and the Zambezi, and resampling them
carefully. Check the nasal turbinates.
