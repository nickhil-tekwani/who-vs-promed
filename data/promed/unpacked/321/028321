Cases of anthrax detected in a field in Río Negro
-------------------------------------------------
The National Service for Agrifood Health and Quality (SENASA) received notification of cases of anthrax in animals located on a property in the Department of Conesa, near Guardia Miter, province of Río Negro.

Carbuncle, also known as Anthrax, is an infectious disease that preferentially affects bovines and is transmissible both to other animals and to humans. Animal producers are mandated to notify SENASA in the event of possible suspicion of its occurrence.

"Yesterday we received notification from a private veterinarian who assists the animal producer, so our staff began with the health protocol that is applied in these cases," reported the Animal Health coordinator of the Northern Patagonia Regional Center from SENASA, Leonardo Ripoll. In this sense, he explained that as established by the protocol, the Rio Negro Public Health authorities were notified of the case and pointed out: "Laboratory analysis confirmed that the death of animals was caused by this disease."

Isolation
---------
To avoid infection, SENASA ordered the interdiction of the establishment where the case was confirmed, preventing the entry and exit of animals, as well as that of hides and offal, and recommended the vaccination of all animals present on the property, a task supervised by the veterinary inspectors of the national health agency. Likewise, producers from neighboring fields were recommended to apply the vaccine in their herds in a preventive manner and became aware of the danger of this disease and the risks it implies.

"Our staff will be verifying this entire animal vaccination process in the field where the case originated," Ripoll said, adding that "it is an acute-type disease, which is spread throughout almost the entire world and is responsible for significant economic losses, but vaccination prevents contagion and the consequent mortality".

Finally, Ripoll urged that "the vaccine be included in the health plan of the productive establishments in the region, despite the fact that its application is not mandatory."

Prevention recommendations
--------------------------
When a case of anthrax is suspected, do not skin or move the animals, and call the veterinarian to make a proper diagnosis and SENASA to notify the disease; use personal protection elements that can be discarded and/or thoroughly sanitized (glasses, gloves, chinstraps, overalls, boots, utensils and disposable material); correctly dispose of animal carcasses, by means of a "controlled covering".

[For a map of the Conesa department in Rio Negro, go to Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conesa_Department. The department is in eastern Rio Negro, a province forming the northern border of Patagonia, and the transition from cattle rearing to sheep. This El Diario report, largely a rewrite of the SENASA formal report, fails to mention what or which species of livestock were affected. As the news report starts with a picture of a bunch of Red Angus cattle this might represent the livestock at risk.

Anthrax is sporadic in Rio Negro and is listed in the recent 2021 annual report. But there is no compulsory annual vaccination of the livestock. The policy would therefore appear to be one of responding in relation to the recognition of new outbreaks. And correctly the authorities are pushing for not just the vaccination of this affected herd but also of other livestock in that part of the province. It is now summer in Argentina and haemophagic tabanid biting flies will be active, and capable of carrying the pathogen to the surrounding herds.

As trees, and therefore branches for burning, are largely lacking in these areas they have a carcass disposal system using tarpaulin weighted down around the carcass. The carcasses are processed in the standard "Trapado Controlado" manner after being sprayed with 5% formaldehyde. This TC method involves covering the carcasses with lime and a large tarpaulin weighted down along its edges, and the bones and hides are recovered about 9 months later for disposal. It is effective. - Mod.MHJ
