'Worst' sea bird breeding season: Climate change may be depleting the
plankton on which fish live
---------------------------------------------------
Britain's sea birds are heading for their worst breeding season on record
due to a decline in the small fish they eat, according to a BBC
investigation. BBC One programme Countryfile has found the fish are
becoming smaller - forcing birds to work harder for a catch with less protein.
Scientists believe warmer waters have depleted plankton stocks, which form
the basis of food for many such fish.
Environmentalists argue that tackling climate change is the only solution.
Scientists examining bird populations on islands like the Shetlands say the
number of kittiwakes has halved in the past 5 years.
They fear that with vital catches of fish such as sand eels getting
smaller, breeds like puffins and guillemots may also decline in the future.
Marine scientists have been monitoring plankton in Plymouth for 70 years.
These microscopic creatures are at the heart of the ocean food chain, and
all sea life depends on them. Rising water temperatures have led to sudden
and dramatic changes -- with the plankton breeding at the wrong time, and
in the wrong place, threatening species like cod.
Fewer plankton make it harder for the fish, and therefore the birds, to
survive.

North Sea birds dying as waters heat up: scientists warn that warmer
conditions could have a catastrophic effect on east coast ecosystem
--------------------------------------------------
Until now their deaths have defied explanation. What caused hundreds of
seemingly healthy seabirds to perish on the North Sea has baffled
scientists since the discovery of their corpses on the Norfolk coastline
this spring. Fears of a major pollution incident such as an oil slick were
quickly dispelled.
But now the mystery is close to being solved and the answer has stunned
ornithologists: the North Sea is heating up at an alarming rate. The broody
expanse of water, famous for its violent storms and freak waves, is slowly
being transformed.
Using the oldest maritime data in the world, scientists have found that
climate change is ridding the North Sea of its precious stocks of plankton,
the microscopic organisms on which all life in the sea depends. As the very
building blocks of the food chain disappear, fish and the birds that feed
on them, such as the puffin and guillemot, are starving to death in what
has been their natural home for thousands of years.
New research from the Sir Alistair Hardy Foundation for Ocean Science in
Plymouth, which has been monitoring plankton around the British Isles for
more than 70 years, reveals that the North Sea is undergoing a major
'regime shift'.
Foundation director Dr Chris Reid said: "What's happening in the North Sea
is it's becoming more like the east coast of Spain. As temperatures get
warmer, we are starting to see a pattern that is more typical of what you
might see in the Mediterranean."
Their concern is supported by another set of findings detailing how the
sudden change of the North Sea is impacting on Britain's sea birds, many of
whom breed in internationally recognised sites.
Seabird colonies off the Yorkshire coast and the Shetland Islands are
headed for their worst breeding season on record. So far a number of
colonies have failed to produce any young at all. Starving chicks
screeching for food from their cliff nests along the eastern coast of
Britain are an increasingly common sight to alarmed bird-watchers. In the
Shetlands alone, thousands of kittiwakes and guillemots, regarded as one of
the hardiest of species, have failed to return to old nesting sites.
Martin Heubeck, a researcher from Aberdeen University who has studied
seabirds on Shetland for 28 years, said: "There just isn't enough food.
Until now the North Sea has offered an ideal nesting place for 21 of the
UK's 24 species of seabird, mainly because of the abundance of seafood
thrown up by the cool tide of the North Sea mixing with the warmer waters
of the Atlantic. The demise of cod stocks in the North Sea triggered the
first concern that the sea's ecosystem was changing, though the effects of
overfishing were blamed."
BBC1's Countryfile will today show evidence that seabirds are being wiped
out by the effects of climate change, and confirm that a new and far
greater threat has emerged. "The whole food web is being unravelled by
climate change, and this could fundamentally be the biggest change in the
North Sea since it was created 10 000 years ago,' said Euan Dunn, head of
marine policy for the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds.
Officials in Whitehall, already nervous over the potential impact of global
warming, are similarly worried. Environment minister Elliot Morley said
government-funded research was coming to the same 'fundamental' conclusion
as that of the foundation. "It does appear that there is a migration of
plankton which is moving north into the colder waters and that the North
Sea is progressively warming. This is very important information," he said.
The rate of cold-water plankton migration though, according to the
Plymouth-based scientists, is astonishing, suggesting that the vital food
supply may have drifted up to 1000 km further north already, almost the
entire length of Britain.
Average sea temperatures throughout the North Sea vary from around 4 C up
to 8 C. However an astonishing 4 C increase in winter sea temperatures has
been recorded in recent years, a rise that experts predict will escalate to
Mediterranean-style temperatures that average above 20 C during summer.
Some have taken comfort in the findings for their role in explaining why up
to 250 guillemots, puffins, razorbills and fulmars were washed ashore on
the Norfolk coast in March. Up to 200 fatalities were found on the beaches
off Northern France and Belgium around the same time. It was impossible to
gauge how many had sunk to the seabed.
The previous year scores of dead seabirds drifted ashore off Aberdeen, one
of the North Sea's principal ports. Similarly evidence that the North Sea's
food chain is collapsing might explain the new phenomenon of puffins
switching from a fish diet to smaller birds.

[Up until now there have been scattered reports from the UK about possible
climate change events, most out of annual bird species counts and thus
their changing distributions, usually northwards. And until now the most
consistent reports have been of coral reef die-offs. One should remember
that Florida and the UK are connected by the Gulf Stream, and as we are
seeing a rise in sea temperatures around the latter, these are probably not
independent of water temperature changes around the former.
The North Sea is very shallow -- as a "sea" it is only a few thousand years
old -- and therefore relatively easy to warm, whether by solar heat or from
the Gulf Stream waters. To survive, these populations will have to shift
north, if they can, but that will take them into areas less ecologically
friendly and supportive.
It would seem to be just a matter of time until we see vector-borne
diseases characteristic of lower latitudes establishing themselves in the
UK and elsewhere in northern Europe. If any of our European members know of
parallel reports from the eastern boundaries of the North Sea, e.g.,
Scandinavia, please bring them to our notice, preferably translated, for
confirmation (or not) of this British series of observations. - Mod.MHJ]
