The total number of confirmed, probable, and suspected cases (see Annex 1) in the West African epidemic of Ebola virus disease (EVD) reported up to the end of 5 Oct 2014 (epidemiological week 40) is 8033 with 3865 deaths [mortality rate 48 percent - Mod.JW]. Countries affected are Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, and the United States of America. A confirmed case of EVD has been reported in Spain, but because the case was confirmed during the week ending 12 Oct 2014 (epidemiological week 41), information on this case will be included in the next Ebola Response Roadmap update.... -- more

[The WHO later said 3865 people had died by the end of 5 Oct 2014, not 3879 as it said on Wed 8 Oct 2014. This does not change the mortality rate. The figures represent the total of Ebola deaths notified by the countries hit by the virus, but the WHO says the figures are under-reported and the true totals are much higher (http://reuters.com/article/idUSL6N0S43S420141009?irpc=932). So the change is not significant. - Mod.JW]

(AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite) (1 of 5)]

The presidents of 3 Ebola-stricken West African nations sought an immediate outpouring of money, doctors and hospital beds, and representatives nations gathered at a World Bank meeting Thursday [9 Oct 2014] promised to send more aid quickly, including a pledge of medical evacuations for health care responders who catch the virus.

"Our people are dying," said President Ernst Bai Koroma, speaking by video from Sierra Leone to an Ebola summit at the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank in Washington....

A World Bank report this week estimated that the economic toll of the largest Ebola outbreak in history could reach USD 32.6 billion if the disease continues to spread in West Africa through next year [2015]. "Every dollar spent now may well be worth more than USD 20 or USD 30 spent in 2 months' time," said David Nabarro, the United Nations special envoy on Ebola. "This is a moment when there must be no postponement of financing decisions, no postponement of action." ... -- more

US military planes arrive at epicenter of Ebola
-----------------------------------------------
6 U.S. military planes arrived Thursday [9 Oct 2014] at the epicenter of the Ebola crisis, carrying more aid and American Marines into Liberia, the country hardest hit by the deadly disease that has devastated West Africa and stirred anxiety across a fearful world.

At a World Bank meeting in Washington DC, the presidents of several West African countries struggling with Ebola pleaded for help, with one calling the epidemic "a tragedy unforeseen in modern times." "Our people are dying," Sierra Leone President Ernest Bai Koroma lamented by videoconference. He said the world is not responding fast enough as children are orphaned and infected doctors and nurses are lost to the disease. Alpha Conde of Guinea said the region's countries are in "a very fragile situation." "This disease is today an international threat and deserves an international response," he said, speaking through a translator. Tom Frieden, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said he was reminded of the start of the AIDS epidemic. We have to work now so this is not the next AIDS," Frieden said.

The fleet that landed outside the Liberian capital of Monrovia consisted of 4 MV-22 Ospreys and 2 KC-130s. The 100 additional Marines bring to just over 300 the total number of American troops in the country, said Maj. Gen. Darryl A. Williams, the commander leading the U.S. response.

UK airport screening
--------------------
Meanwhile, British authorities said they would introduce "enhanced" screening of travelers for Ebola at Heathrow and Gatwick airports and Eurostar rail terminals. Prime Minister David Cameron's office said passengers arriving from West Africa would be quizzed about their travels and contacts. Some people could be given a medical assessment and advice on what to do if they develop symptoms....

The U.S. military is working to build medical centers in Liberia and may send up to 4000 soldiers to help with the Ebola crisis. Medical workers and beds for Ebola patients are sorely lacking....

British Defense Secretary Michael Fallon said his country would provide more than 750 troops to help build treatment centers and an Ebola "training academy" in Sierra Leone. Army medics and helicopters will provide direct support. Britain will also contribute an aviation support ship. British troops are expected to arrive next week in Sierra Leone, where they will join military engineers and planners who have been there for nearly a month helping to construct medical centers....

The German military, which has already been flying material such as protective clothing from Senegal to the worst-hit countries, planned to start a wider deployment of aid in mid-November [2014]. The military is expected to set up a clinic for 50 patients.

Sierra Leone officials finally released a shipping container filled with medical gear and mattresses that had been held up at the port for more than a month. Ibrahim Bangura, an official who handles medical supplies, said the container's contents were finally in his possession on Thursday [9 Oct 2014]....

Guinea: "massive" influx of cases
---------------------------------
In Guinea, where the 1st Ebola cases were confirmed back in March [2014], Doctors Without Borders warned on Thursday [9 Oct 2014] of a "massive" influx of cases in the capital. The aid group's center in Conakry received 22 patients on Monday [6 Oct 2014] alone, including 18 from the same region 50 km [about 31 miles] east of the city, the group said, adding that its facilities were reaching their limits.

Uganda doctor dies
------------------
A Uganda-born doctor, John Taban Dada, died Thursday [9 Oct 2014] of Ebola at a treatment center on the outskirts of Monrovia. His death brings to 4 the number of doctors who have died in Liberia since the outbreak. More than 90 health workers, including nurses and physician assistants, have also died.... In Germany, a man infected in Liberia arrived Thursday [9 Oct 2014] at a hospital for treatment -- the 3rd Ebola patient to be flown to the country. The St. Georg Hospital in Leipzig said the patient works for the United Nations in Liberia.... -- more

[4] Liberia: German military evacuation problem
Date: Thu 9 Oct 2014

http://www.breitbart.com/Breitbart-London/2014/10/09/Bundeswehr-Equipment-Failing-Defence-Minister


The parlous state of Germany's military, which is plagued by broken, undeployable equipment and a shortage of spare parts, has led to the admission that the nation doesn't even have the capacity to evacuate Ebola-infected German soldiers, despite promises made last month [September 2014]....

When the Bundeswehr appealed for volunteers from among its ranks in September [2014], it was on the condition that any soldier who contracted Ebola in the course of delivering aid to West Africa would be immediately airlifted back to Germany for treatment, reports The Local. Despite 5000 men volunteering to go, the defence minister Ursula von der Leyen has been forced to admit Germany would be unable to undertake evacuations after a month of embarrassing failures for the Bundeswehr exposed the diminished capacity of the force.... Germany now has so few working transport aircraft, it had to borrow a Dutch military transport ... but that too broke down.

[5] Liberia: optimistic assessment, CDC

CDC epidemiologist sees hope for controlling Ebola in southeastern Liberia
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Adam Bjork, an epidemiologist with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta [Georgia, USA], spent the last 2 weeks in the southeastern corner of the country [Liberia], which has seen relatively few Ebola cases.

Bjork worked with local health officials to piece together the chain of transmission and to help mount an effective response. Despite the bleak situation, he's still optimistic about the Ebola outbreak in the remote area. "They could get in front of it out there," Bjork says.

During his 2-week stay, Bjork worked with a team in Fish Town to do contact tracing. He was surprised by how well-organized the effort was already. "I came with a template to make sure they had initiated the tracing, but what they'd done had covered the vast majority of it," Bjork says. But they were short on motorbikes and vehicles to do the fieldwork. "They know what to do, but they don't have the resources," he says. "And they need to communicate with nearby communities so they're accepted there to do it."

At 1st, the contact tracers were met with some hostility; one town threatened to burn the ambulance some of the workers were traveling in. The team held a community meeting with town leaders. "I've never seen a large-scale community gathering change its mood like that after getting information delivered and being heard," he says. "By the end, they were OK with it."

Bjork says he saw a lot of signs that the international response to the epidemic is being ramped up. Welthungerhilfe, a German nongovernmental organization, was helping build a community care center at a local school that would isolate suspected Ebola patients and provide some medical treatment. Samaritan's Purse, the missionary group, flew a team in by helicopter to start building a more sophisticated Ebola treatment center. The World Health Organization and the Liberian ministry of health sent in trainers to teach health care workers how to safely do their jobs.

Ebola outbreak: UK sending 750 troops to Sierra Leone
-----------------------------------------------------
The UK is sending 750 military personnel to Sierra Leone to help deal with the deadly Ebola outbreak, Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond has confirmed. The UK will also send medical ship the Royal Fleet Auxiliary Argus and 3 Merlin helicopters. The personnel will be deployed next week [12-18 Oct 2014]. It comes as Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said it was "now entirely possible that someone with Ebola will come to the UK either by one route or another". The latest figures show 3879 people have died in the West African epidemic. The vast majority of deaths have been in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, where 879 have died.

Brigadier Paul Gibson: "They've been planning this mission for some time and part of that planning will be extensive training of personnel." British troops will help to establish treatment centres and a training academy, with the ship and helicopters providing support.

[clip]

It is estimated the measures will help the country treat nearly 8800 patients over 6 months.

Mr Hammond said: "This disease is an unprecedented threat that knows no borders. We have to get ahead of this disease. If we get ahead of it and rise to the challenge, we can contain it and beat it." Philip Hammond and John Kerry urged all nations to boost their response to combat the virus. He said the UK had committed more than USD 200 million (GBP 125 million) to the programme in Sierra Leone.... 40 British military engineers have already travelled to the country to set up the facilities, said BBC defence correspondent Jonathan Beale.

Sweden announced it was sending a team of doctors to Sierra Leone on Wednesday [8 Oct 2014], following criticism that it was not doing as much to help tackle the virus as its European neighbours. 12 people will travel to west Africa, according to Ann-Charlotte Zachrisson, Director of Operations at Sweden's National Agency for Safety and Preparedness; 5 of them are understood to be specialist doctors. One Swedish doctor is already working alongside a Danish team in Sierra Leone and some Swedes are volunteering for non-profit organisations across the affected countries.... -- more

Travelers from West African countries will face stronger Ebola screening at U.S. airports
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Enhanced screening measures aimed at finding travelers infected with Ebola will be utilized at 5 of the busiest international airports in the United States, federal authorities said Wednesday [8 Oct 2014].

Travelers originating in the 3 West African countries hit hardest by the disease will be given questionnaires and have their temperatures taken at these U.S. airports, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Department of Homeland Security announced Wednesday.

The new screening will begin at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York on Saturday [11 Oct 2014]. Next week [week of 13 Oct 2014], it will be expanded to Washington Dulles International Airport outside Washington, D.C.; O'Hare International Airport, in Chicago [Illinois]; Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport in Atlanta [Georgia]; and Newark Liberty International Airport [New Jersey] outside New York.... Any travelers with fever, other symptoms or worrisome answers on a health questionnaire will be checked out at a CDC quarantine station. Travelers who do not require additional checking or quarantine will be asked to leave their contact information and check their temperature every day.... -- more

[There are serious problems involved with airport screening -- see comments in Ebola virus disease - ex Africa (08): US death, concern re spread, travel ban 20141008.2843902 and part [4] in Canada: Ebola screening on arrival in Ebola virus disease - ex Africa (09): WHO, Spain, Australia, Canada, USA 20141009.2848352, but pressure from the public has forced its implementation.

A major problem is with setting the fever level at 101.5 F (38.6 C). Both the Texas and Madrid cases were initially turned away from hospitals because their temperatures were lower. But a lower threshold would catch large numbers of people with the sniffles and minor conditions. - Mod.JW]
