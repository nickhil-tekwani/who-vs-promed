_Grapevine Pinot gris virus_ (_Trichovirus_, GPGV) was detected for the 1st time in Lebanon. Samples were collected randomly from 9 vineyards located in Bekaa Valley. Out of 108 samples, 14 tested positive for GPGV. None of the infected vines showed disease symptoms. Infection with GPGV was found in single or multiple infections with grapevine virus A and grapevine fleck virus.

[_Grapevine Pinot gris virus_ (GPGV; genus _Trichovirus_) is a newly described virus of grapevine which was identified in Italy on cv. Pinot gris vines with symptoms of chlorotic mottling and leaf deformations. It was detected by new large scale sequencing methods ("deep sequencing") in co-infection with several other viruses and viroids. Therefore, it was initially not possible to clearly associate the virus with specific symptoms. GPGV has since also been detected in symptomless vines.

Amongst the grapevine viruses, GPGV appears to be most closely related to _Grapevine berry inner necrosis virus_ (GINV) of the same genus. Trichoviruses are mostly transmitted by grafting material and mechanical means, and both GPGV and GINV can also be transmitted by mite vectors. Work is in progress to investigate symptomatology (alone and in co-infections), epidemiology and economic impact of GPGV. So far, it has been found in more than 30 grape cultivars worldwide of both wine and table grapes, as well as in a small number of herbaceous hosts which may serve as pathogen reservoirs.

Disease management of grapevine viruses and viroids may include phytosanitation, such as removal of infected plants and disinfection of vineyard tools. Use of certified clean planting material (including tissue cultures, rootstocks and scions for grafting) is essential.

Given the vegetative propagation methods used for grapevines, longevity of the host and historic international exchange of germplasm, GPGV, like some other grapevine viruses, may be widely distributed in several or many commercial cultivars. The detection of GPGV in Lebanon represents its first report for the Middle East region.

The other viruses mentioned above in coinfections with GPGV are _Grapevine virus A_ (GVA; genus _Vitivirus_) and _Grapevine fleck virus_ (GFV; currently only species in genus _Maculavirus_). For more information on these viruses see links below.
