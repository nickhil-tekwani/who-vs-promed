On 6 Jun 2004, 2 persons were diagnosed with anthrax at Harharpara in
Murshidabad, health officials said.
Chief Medical Officer Dr. S. Sarkar said 2 persons aged 36 and 21 were
diagnosed with anthrax after they reportedly ate meat from a diseased animal.
Over 30 people have been affected with the disease in the nearby areas in the
last 2 months.
