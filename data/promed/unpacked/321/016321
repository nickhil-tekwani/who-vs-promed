On Mon 15 Jan 2007 the Ministry of Public Health and Social Welfare
of Paraguay (MSPBS) declared an epidemiological alert for the entire
nation in light of the number of dengue cases and the real
possibility of dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) cases. On Sat 20 Jan
2007, the 1st 2 fatalities from DHF were reported.
Summary of the current situation in Paraguay
---------------------------------------------------
As of Mon 29 Jan 2007 (Epidemiological Week No. 5), the following
figures were reported: 1394 reported cases of dengue fever, 8 cases
of dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), and 3 deaths.
Case-fatality rate [of DHF cases]: 37.5 percent
Departments Affected: Asuncion, Central, Amambay, Alto Parana,
Cordillera, and Guaira.
With continuous communication with the PAHO Country Office in
Paraguay, the Department of Health Surveillance and the National
Vector Control Program made public the country's epidemiological
situation and activities being carried out. Their objective is also
to report promptly to decision-makers and activate surveillance
activities in accordance with the MERCOSUR plan regarding dengue
prevention and control in border areas. [MERCOSUR is the Southern
Common Market; a trade alliance between Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay,
Uruguay and Venezuela (see
<http://www.mercosur.int/msweb/principal/contenido.asp> for more
information on MERCOSUR) - Mod.MPP]
Paraguay has reported 2 dengue epidemics, one in 2000 and the other
at the beginning of 2006. The Ministry of Public Health and Social
Welfare of Paraguay (MSPBS) has recorded 29 000 confirmed cases over
the past 7 years.
In 2006, 1700 cases were reported in a classical dengue outbreak in
Asuncion, with the Dengue 3 (DEN-3) [virus] serotype. The country
managed to bring this outbreak under control and was able to minimize
the level of transmission until October 2006, when an increase in the
number of cases was detected. During the 1st week of January 2007,
there were 390 cases of dengue, with 161 reported in the 2nd week and
120 during the 3rd, including 2 fatal cases of DHF with acute
clinical symptoms. The reported cases correspond to the DEN-3 [virus]
serotype. As of Mon 29 Jan 2007 (Epidemiological Week No. 5), 1394
cases of dengue fever had been reported, with 8 cases of DHF and 3
deaths. The presence of DEN-3 [virus] in Asuncion gives reason to
suspect the possibility of a mass outbreak, though there has been a
timely response and the outbreak has been controlled on time with
regard to the population groups susceptible to this serotype. Based
on the DHF cases recorded in Paraguay, the public health authorities
have taken a series of measures to avoid the appearance of more cases
and to prevent deaths from DHF. The outbreak is concentrated in the
capital city of Asuncion and in the cities of Pedro Juan Caballero,
Paraguari, Quiindy, San Lorenzo, Fernando de la Mora, Capiata, and
Lambare. Affected departments [state equivalents - Mod.TY] include
Central, Amambay, Alto Parana, Cordillera, and Guaira.
Prevention and control activities underway
---------------------------------------------------
The following specific activities are currently being carried out:
The Ministry of Public Health and Social Welfare, the Armed Forces,
municipal health authorities, neighborhood commissions, the private
sector, and the urban transportation system are all participating in
control measures to eliminate the disease-transmitting vector and any
breeding sites -- neighborhood by neighborhood. Regional authorities
were called on to scale up their preparedness and response system and
their primary-care services to handle DHF during this incipient
phase. The country has developed its capacity for response and for
having trained personnel to provide treatment in cases of DHF and
Dengue Shock Syndrome (DSS). However, this is the 1st time face that
the health system will be tested in its ability to handle DHF.
Vector control activities
--------------------------
The infestation indices for 2nd semester 2006 were lower when
compared to 2005 data. However, infestation indices began to increase
between October and December 2006 in some neighborhoods. The indices
of 15 percent fell to 3-4 percent. Without proper waste management,
however, there could be an increase. Increased rainfall and climate
change have been the most determining factors for this resurgence.
Elimination of breeding sites activities are being carried out in the
neighborhoods, and special spraying has been employed. There is a
sufficient supply of insecticides for eliminating adult mosquitoes
and larvae when providing a timely response. Resources have been
mobilized and/or reallocated for outbreak response, with 120
campaigns involved in making house calls. The main breeding sites are
cans, plates under plant pots, and tires. Interventions are being
carried out by the District Attorney's Environmental Office to fine,
indict, or incarcerate recurring offenders. The Program Director has
praised the control measures and response activities that are being
carried out by local authorities (improvement in tire facilities,
uncultivated patios, etc.).
Raising public awareness with Dengue Mosquito Day
---------------------------------------------------
On Thu 25 Jan 2007, the President of the Republic -- together with
his cabinet -- made the decision to convene a major mobilization. On
Mon 29 Jan [2007], activities to eliminate breeding sites were
intensified. Through a Presidential Decree, a short holiday was
declared for all civil servants in the country to give them the time
to support this event.
The Ministry of Health has requested technical cooperation from
PAHO/WHO in organizing and carrying out this event. To act on this
request, PAHO responded immediately by sending a consultant in
Communications who had taken part in organizing Dia Dengue (Dia D, or
Dengue Day) in Brazil. In addition, a team was formed in the PAHO
Country Office to provide support not only in organizing the event
but also in responding to the current epidemic.
Mass communication
------------------------
Despite the communications efforts, communities are still not
supporting the elimination of breeding sites. The greatest problem
and complaint at the grassroots level is the lack of continuity in
municipal trash-collection services. The "D-Day" activities in
Paraguay support raising awareness and providing information to the
public, [in order] to involve everybody in identifying mosquito
breeding sites and eliminating them.
External technical cooperation
------------------------------------
To comply with current technical-cooperation agreements, PAHO is
providing advisory services in the following areas: Mass
Communication, Patient-Information Services, and Health-Service
Organization. It is noteworthy that Paraguay has prepared its
Strategy of Integrated Management for the Prevention and Control of
Dengue (EGI-Dengue) and developed its ability to respond to the
increase in the number of cases, not only institutionally but also
comprehensively, as we can see when dengue cases started appearing in
2006. We need to remember that dengue-related problems transcend the
borders of the health sector and that it is crucial to involve other
sectors as well as key actors outside the sector.
During the past year [2006], an outbreak occurred in the Tri-Country
Border Zone in Puerto Iguazu, which was handled appropriately by
Argentina, Paraguay, and Brazil. This is an experience worth
replicating. At this time, there is also a high level of
collaboration among another 3 bordering countries: Argentina, Brazil,
and Bolivia. Border commissions and other local mechanisms have been
formed that are sending out systematic information on the spread of
this outbreak via networks established in both the sub region and the
region, in order to guarantee immediate response to the appearance of
new cases or outbreaks in border areas.
[It is clear that the government of Paraguay, with the help of PAHO,
has launched a vigorous campaign to control the dengue virus vector.
This report also illustrates the difficulty in enlisting the level of
public cooperation that is required to accomplish that goal. We look
forward to receiving follow-up reports on the progress of control
efforts and an update on case numbers. ProMED thanks A-Lan Banks

Bolivia (Santa Cruz): red alert
------------------------------
The Departmental [state equivalent - Mod.TY] Health Department (SEDES
[Spanish acronym]) confirmed yesterday [30 Jan 2007] that a
23-year-old woman died this past Friday [26 Jan 2007] due to dengue
hemorrhagic fever [DHF]. This is the 1st [DHF] death recorded in
Santa Cruz in the past 3 years. In 2003, 5 people lost their lives
from this disease according to the Epidemiological Unit.
Roberto Vargas, director of SEDES, informed us that due to this
situation, the task of elimination of the mosquito _Aedes aegypti_
has been strengthened with [the use] of 19 [insecticide] fogging
machines in rural and urban areas of the department.
This official indicated that he has been trying to communicate with
health authorities in Paraguay where dengue epidemics have been
reported. "We wish to exchange information in order to combat this
disease more effectively" he said.
With 47 confirmed cases of classical dengue fever and one of DHF in
Santa Cruz, as well as others in Cochabamba and Beni, the Vice
Minister of Health declared a red alert in the country to prevent the
spread of the disease, taking into account that rains and floods have
occurred due to El Nino [effects]. "We are on red alert due to the
possibility that the result of the constant rains [would lead to]
more disease cases, among them dengue. We are carrying out daily
epidemiological surveillance and taking necessary preventive
[actions], such as spraying" said Juan Nogales, Vice Minister of Health.
Yesterday [30 Jan 2007], the Beni Departmental Council issued a
declaration of state of emergency for the department, to facilitate
and put into action the attention needed by more than 2000 families
in riverine communities which have been affected by the alarming
increase in the waters of the Mamore and other rivers, over-topping
their banks.

Bolivia reports 7 new cases of dengue fever
---------------------------------------------------
Authorities from the regional Health Service said on Fri 2 Feb 2007,
that 7 new cases of dengue fever have been detected in recent days in
the northern Bolivian province of Beni.
Cesar Ligeron, head of the vector control program, urged residents to
work together to eliminate the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito that spreads dengue
[virus].
As intense rain in the region diluted the effect of insecticide, it
is almost useless to conduct spraying there, he said. Instead he
called on authorities from the regional capital Trinidad to clean up
and collect garbage in areas within the city that could help
[prevent] the spread of mosquitoes.
Ligeron said that his organization wanted daily reports on the
appearance of new cases and asked anyone who suspected they have
dengue to take a test provided by the National Tropical Diseases Service.
One person has died this year [2007] from hemorrhagic dengue, in the
eastern Santa Cruz province. Across all Bolivia there have been 270
suspected dengue infections, 47 of which have been confirmed.
In 2006 there were 1988 cases of classic dengue in Bolivia, or 21 per
100 000, with the vast majority reported in Santa Cruz.

[The Beni province is often affected by seasonal rains and flooding.
The floods and the accompanying rains would be expected to increase
breeding sites for the mosquito vector. Vector control under these
circumstances would be difficult. Roads in the area often become
impassible during the rainy season. - Mod.TY]

At least 13 000 cases of dengue fever, including 2 fatal hemorrhagic
dengue, have been reported in the southern Brazilian state of Mato
Grosso do Sul in January [2007], official news agency "Brasil" said
on Wednesday [31 Jan 2007].
Health Minister Agenor Alvares described this figure as very high,
nearly matching the 15 000 cases seen in the first 11 months of last
year [2006]. Alvares said health authorities were adopting all
possible measures to fight the disease, noting that "as soon as we
knew about the situation in the state, we sent vehicles and trained
staff to help fight the mosquito which spreads dengue fever." He
added that "the number of cases has increased 300 percent, and at
least 36 municipalities are affected." "State courts have ruled to
open sealed buildings so that health officers can overtake the
disease outbreaks. Most cases broke out because people failed to take
proper care at home," the minister said.
Dengue is an acute, infectious tropical disease caused by an
arbovirus transmitted by the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito. Dengue [virus]
types 1, 2, and 3 are found in Brazil while type 3, the severest,
arrived in the nation in 2000 and spread rapidly through Mato Grosso do Sul.

WHO describes dengue fever as a severe, flu-like illness that affects
infants, young children, and adults but is seldom fatal. The clinical
features of dengue fever vary according to the age of the patient.
Infants and young children may have a non-specific febrile illness
with rash (although some infants and very young children may develop
shock syndrome, with sudden loss of circulating fluid volume, and
die). Older children and adults may have either a mild febrile
syndrome or the classical incapacitating disease, with abrupt onset
and high fever, severe headache, pain behind the eyes, muscle and
joint pains, and rash.
Dengue hemorrhagic fever is a potentially deadly complication that is
characterized by high fever, hemorrhagic phenomena -- often with
enlargement of the liver -- and in severe cases, circulatory failure.
The illness commonly begins with a sudden rise in temperature
accompanied by facial flush and other non-specific constitutional
symptoms of dengue fever. The fever usually continues for 2 to 7 days
and can be as high as 40-41 C (104-105.8 F), possibly with febrile
convulsions and hemorrhagic phenomena. In moderate DHF cases, all
signs and symptoms abate after the fever subsides. In severe cases,
the patient's condition may suddenly deteriorate after a few days of
fever; the temperature drops, followed by signs of circulatory
failure, and the patient may rapidly go into a critical state of
shock and die within 12-24 hours or quickly recover following
appropriate volume replacement therapy. There is no specific
treatment for dengue fever. However, careful clinical management by
experienced physicians and nurses frequently saves the lives of DHF
patients. With appropriate intensive supportive therapy, mortality
may be reduced to less than one percent. Maintenance of the
circulating fluid volume is the central feature of DHF case
management. (Abstracted from the WHO website fact sheet on dengue:
