[1] Zhejiang: positive duck samples, additional market closures

The National Avian Flu Reference Laboratory said Thu [11 Apr 2013] that the new strain of [avian influenza virus], H7N9, has been found in 2 out of a total of 10 duck samples in Huzhou, Zhejiang Province.

The finding, which came after the virus was previously detected in chickens and pigeons, triggered a mass culling of some 7000 live poultry in a key trading market in the city.

The live poultry trade in some 15 wet markets across the city has also been suspended after the finding.

The National Health and Family Planning Commission said that by late Thursday [11 Apr 2013], the new strain of bird flu had killed 10 patients in the country, and there have been 38 infections detected, a figure that was brought up by the 5 new cases in Shanghai and Zhejiang Province Thursday.

In order to prevent the spread of the virus, regions including Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui have taken measures to cull poultry and ban trade.

Shanghai has banned the poultry trade and imports from other regions, and also stopped the wild bird trading business in 162 enterprises.

At the West Lake scenic spot in Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, captive bred birds, including swans, doves, and peacocks, have been isolated by the management office. The office also warned tourists to stay away from birds around the lake, the Xinhua News Agency reported.

In other places where no H7N9 cases have been reported yet, such as Qingdao in Shandong Province and Taiyuan in Shanxi Province, the live poultry trade has also been banned as a preventive measure.

Zeng Guang, chief epidemiologist at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, told the Global Times that it was still not certain that shutting down poultry businesses would be effective.

"There is still no solid research data showing that the ban of the live poultry trade has slowed the spread of the virus, though it might to some extent help contain cross-infection between poultry in some infected areas," Zeng said.

Zeng added that studies into the prevention of H7N9 are still in the very early stages.

The national commission stated on Wednesday [10 Apr 2013] that H7N9 was mainly spread through inhalation, while pointing out that people who are involved in the live poultry trade or slaughter have a high risk of becoming infected.

"Banning the trade and culling birds is only an expedient. Research into vaccines and effective medication are critical," Zeng said.

[2] Monitoring expanded to pigs

China's agriculture authority has expanded the monitoring for the H7N9 strain of bird flu to pigs in order to have a better understanding of the virus that had infected at least 33 people [now 38] by Wednesday [10 Apr 2013].

Monitoring pigs, in addition to poultry and wild birds, may provide a deeper understanding of H7N9, including its origin, host range, route of transmission, and the degree of harm, according to the Ministry of Agriculture. The ministry issued an emergency monitoring plan this week in response to the outbreak of H7N9.

Experts said that pigs have been included in the plan in an effort to better explore the transmission route, since it is still unknown why and how the bird flu virus infects human beings.

The World Health Organization said on its website that its analyses of the genes of influenza A H7 viruses have shown signs of adaptation to grow in mammalian species. "These adaptations include an ability to bind to mammalian cells and to grow at temperatures close to the normal body temperature of mammals (which is lower than that of birds)," it said.

The monitoring plan is trying to find evidence of adaptation if there is any, said Sun Quanhui, a science adviser at the World Society for the Protection of Animals. "By expanding the exclusion range of virus infection, the authorities will provide more scientific evidence that will help control and prevent human infection of H7N9," said Sun.

Yao Jiezhang, a veterinarian and spokesman for the Beijing Bureau of Agriculture's animal husbandry and veterinary station, said that if pigs were found carrying the virus, people would get infected more easily. "Since we share more similarities in cells and body temperature with pigs than poultry, the likeliness of receiving the virus from pigs is larger than from birds," he added.

According to the plan, the animal disease control and prevention center of the Agriculture Ministry will take samples nationwide from live bird markets, slaughterhouses, poultry farms, and wild bird habitats, and test them for viruses.

[3] Hebei province (Lakes Baiyangdian and Hengshui): monitoring of migratory birds
Date: Thu 11 Apr 2013

Yesterday [10 Apr 2013], the CDC of the Hebei Province held a press conference related to avian influenza H7N9. It was reported that 30 suspected humans have been found negative to H7N9. Li Law, director of the Office of Hebei Province Health Department of Health Emergency, said that so far, the province did not find human infection with the avian influenza H7N9.

Out of China's main birds migratory routes, 2 pass through Hebei. As temperatures rise, monitoring efforts are to be strengthened. through the province, requiring alertness and monitoring. The 2 main lakes in Hebei, Lake Baiyangdian and Lake Hengshui, are to be covered by the monitoring.

So far it is not clear if the source of human exposure [by direct contact with secretions or excretions) is [domestic] poultry, the director of Hebei Province CDC [virology], Qi Shunxiang, reminded the possible role of migratory birds. Inhabitants of the key areas are advised to try not to touch the surface of the water visited by wild birds and from close contact with domestic chickens, ducks and other domestic and wild birds. Dead birds should not be touched/moved; the agricultural sector should be reported immediately to enable tests to detect the cause of death. Following possible contact with wild and/or water birds, hands and faces should be washed and wild birds/venison not eaten. Public health and veterinary units will strongly cooperate.

[When the H7N9 event became initially known on 31 Mar 2013, 3 main animal-related questions came to mind:
a. How long has this strain been in circulation (tracing back tests in humans and animals),
b. What are the geographical limits within which the said circulation had taken place, and
c. What is its spectrum in animals, including wild birds.

Definitive answers are not yet available. So far, the source of infection in the diseased persons could not be satisfactorily clarified: in a proportion of the cases, no occupational or incidental exposure has been demonstrated. There is no evidence of human-to-human transmission. It has become known that the virus has been circulating in Eastern China at least since February 2013.

The information included in item 1 above adds ducks to 2 animal species (pigeons and chickens) found H7N9-infected so far. Quails have been circumstantially suspected, without evidence. It is of utmost importance to complete the spectrum of the virus reservoir in domestic AND wild birds. No information on infection (or its absence) in wild birds has become available yet. Migratory birds may potentially spread the virus to western China and beyond; urban populations (such as pigeons and crows), if found infected, may pose a serious direct environmental threat.

It is encouraging to note the claimed strengthened monitoring of wild birds, particularly water birds, in Hebei (item 3 above). Another location which deserves similar action is (China's largest) Qinghai Lake, located in Qinghai province, where -- in April-May 2005 (but also later) -- mass mortality in wild bird was recorded due to another avian influenza virus strain, H5N1. If H7N9 is less or non-pathogenic to birds, its odds of 'successfully' spreading are (were?) even better. The rate and duration of H7N9 viraemia, and its pathogenicity, in wild birds are key questions.

As to control measures in animals: even if a vaccine becomes available and shown to be efficacious, it will be difficult, if not impossible, to convince farmers to vaccinate their stock against a virus which does not cause losses/clinical disease.

Information on H7N9 in wild birds is requested. - Mod.AS]
