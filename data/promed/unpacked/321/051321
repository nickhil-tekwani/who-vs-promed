Restrictions have been imposed on the border of Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan due to the situation with anthrax in Kyrgyzstan, said Arman Utegulov, chairman of the vet control and surveillance committee of the Ministry of Agriculture of Kazakhstan.

"There is no ban between Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, but there are restrictions on animal imports. Product import is allowed," he said. He said sanitary control on the border is conducted in a "routine mode."

11 people with assumed anthrax were hospitalized in Kyrgyzstan. The diagnosis has not been confirmed by lab tests.

[Jalal-Abad is in western Kyrgyzstan at the head of the Fergana valley; see http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/commonwealth/kyrgyzstan_physio-2005.jpg.

The Fergana valley is rife with livestock anthrax, so these people could have gotten infected from one of their own animals that died and was butchered, or from Uzbek meat they bought in the market. Without a coordinated vaccination control program between the 2 countries in this region, we will continue to see outbreaks there. But without further details, 11 people hospitalized with suspected anthrax is indicative of some street market meat as well as the farm's butchering team. Such a number is not atypical for exposure to just one dead cow. - Mod.MHJ
