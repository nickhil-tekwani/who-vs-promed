The hepatitis A epidemic in Prague is still spreading. More people
are affected than at any time during the past 9 years. "The situation
is not calm, [but] fortunately not critical either," stated the chief
health officer [of the city]. According to him the number of cases
may increase until the beginning of November [2008].

Up to the present, 602 cases have been diagnosed with hepatitis A.
Last week [week of 22 Sep 2008], the number stood at 374. The city of
Prague and middle Bohemia are the most affected regions. In contrast
to previous years, most of the patients are not children. The most
affected demographic groups are adults of 20-45 years of age, as a
consequence of the fact that the epidemic started among drug addicts
in Prague, more specifically Russian drug addicts.

Compared to previous years, the hepatitis epidemic has spread quite
rapidly. [Currently the supply of hepatitis A vaccine in Prague has
become depleted], but it is expected that an adequate supply will
become available next week [week of 6 Oct 2008].

[Hepatitis A is a self-limiting disease, which results in fulminant
hepatitis and death in only a small proportion of patients.
Nonetheless, it is a significant cause of morbidity and
socio-economic losses in many parts of the world. Transmission of
hepatitis A virus is typically by the faecal-oral route. Infections
occur early in life in areas where sanitation is poor and living
conditions are crowded. With improved sanitation and hygiene,
infections are delayed and consequently the number of persons
susceptible to the disease increases. Under these conditions
explosive epidemics can arise from faecal contamination of a single
source. As almost all hepatitis A virus infections are spread by the
faecal-oral route, good personal hygiene, high quality standards for
public water supplies and proper disposal of sanitary waste are
important factors in control of hepatitis A virus infection.

In the report above the identification of drug addicts as the initial
source of the outbreak implies blood-borne transmission. Hepatitis
among drug addicts is usually a consequence of [shared needle]
transmission of hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C viruses. Transmission
of hepatitis A virus by blood-borne transmission would be unusual,
although not impossible, and perhaps other mechanisms should be sought
to explain this significant outbreak of hepatitis A infection in the
Czech Republic. Further information is awaited on the course of the
outbreak. The predicted decline of the outbreak in November (2008)
will be unlikely if drug abusers are a major factor in the spread of
the infection.
