[Rabies is endemic in Mexico and Central America. There have been
cases in livestock and/or humans in Guatemala and its neighboring
countries -- Mexico, El Salvador, and Honduras.
ProMED-mail requests additional information concerning the exposure
of this unfortunate case and whether post-exposure treatment was undertaken.
