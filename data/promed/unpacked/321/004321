The latest UK/MAFF BSE Progress Report published today (18 August) shows
that the epidemic of BSE in the United Kingdom continues to decline. The
number of clinically suspect cases of BSE reported in Great Britain has
continued to fall and for the six months to 30 June 1998 was 22% less than
for the same period in 1997 and 65% less than for the same period in 1996.
A continued improvement is expected for the future. The Ministry of
Agriculture said 1,280 cases of Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) were
reported between January 1 and August 7 this year. This compared to 4,311
cases in the whole of 1997 and 8,016 cases in 1996. At the height of the
epidemic in 1992 the number of cattle affected rose to 36,000, and around
150,000 animals have been slaughtered.
The report also shows that nearly two thirds of UK herds with adult
breeding cattle have never had a case of BSE. Furthermore, 84% of beef
suckler herds have never had a case of BSE. Reported incidence also shows
that herds with more than four cases of BSE account for almost three
quarters of all BSE cases, but represent only just over 10% of all herds.
Britain has ordered the removal from the human food chain of all cattle
over 30 months old. A ministry spokesman said most of the cases now being
reported were from dairy animals more than two years old. Agriculture
Minister Nick Brown said last month that a European Union ban on exports of
British beef imposed two years ago would remain in force through the
summer, and announced a new cull of cattle to help hasten its lifting. He
said that Brussels had demanded a cull of the offspring of infected cattle
before it agreed to allow export of mainland British beef from cattle born
since August 1, 1996, to resume.
The Report outlines the measures which have been taken to protect public
health since December 1997, including legislation on cattle identification
and on controls for the exports of meat, meat products, meat preparations,
other products of animal origin and pet food derived from bovines
slaughtered outside the UK. It summarises the results of action to enforce
existing public health measures, and describes progress made in setting up
a cattle tracing system. An update on the number of cases of nvCJD is
included. [Available on ProMED-mail 980806221755. MHJ]
The report sets out measures taken on the protection of animal health
including controls on animal feed; has a section on the European
perspective outlining the lifting of the EU ban on the export of UK beef
from certified herds in Northern Ireland -- exports from Northern Ireland,
which maintains a long-standing and a sophisticated system of tracking
cattle movements, have been allowed since June 1 this year; and details the
steps being taken towards acceptance of the scheme for the export of beef
from cattle born after 1 August 1996 which would apply to the whole of the
UK.
Britain's National Audit Office said in a report earlier this month that
tackling mad cow disease would cost British and European taxpayers some 3.5
billion pounds ($5.8 billion).
This Report is the latest in a series of 6 monthly GB Progress Reports on
BSE. The last Report was published in March 1998. 2. The public can obtain
