Outbreaks of the fungal pathogen _Candida auris_ in healthcare settings, particularly in intensive care units (ICUs), may be linked to multi-use patient equipment, such as thermometers, according to research presented at the 28th European Congress of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ECCMID) [Madrid, Spain, 21-24 Apr 2018].

Researchers examined one of the largest outbreaks of the emerging drug-resistant fungal pathogen _C. auris_ to date. The outbreak occurred in Oxford University Hospitals' Neurosciences Intensive Care Unit (NICU) [John Radcliffe Hospital, Headington, Oxfordshire] in the United Kingdom. In investigating the possible source of the outbreak, researchers found a major source for spreading the fungus was multi-use patient monitoring equipment, such as axillary thermometers, those used to measure temperature in the armpit. These thermometers had been used in 57 of the 66 patients, or 86 percent, who had been admitted to the NICU before being diagnosed with _C. auris_. Use of these thermometers was still a strong risk factor for having _C. auris_ after the research team controlled for other factors, such as how long a patient remained in the NICU, how unwell a patient was and their blood tests.

Presenting author Dr David Eyre from the Nuffield Department of Medicine at the University of Oxford said: "Despite a bundle of infection control interventions, the outbreak was only controlled following removal of the temperature probes."

Between 2 Feb 2015 and 31 Aug 2017, the researchers analysed 70 patients who were either colonised with _C. auris_, meaning they had the fungus but showed no signs of illness, or infected, meaning they did show symptoms. 66 patients, or 94 percent, had been admitted to the NICU before being diagnosed. 7 patients developed invasive infections, but none died directly as a result of a _C. auris_ infection. Most patients were colonised for between one to 2 months. There was no evidence that _C. auris_ was associated with increased rates of death when adjusting for age, sex, and the reason the patient had been originally admitted to the ward.

_C. auris_ is an emerging fungal pathogen, which means its presence is growing in the population and it can be responsible for infections in wounds and the bloodstream. The reasons for _C. auris_ spreading are not well understood, but this study offers hope of controlling the fungus' rise. The researchers found that the fungus tested was resistant to common treatments. _C. auris_ is typically resistant to many of the available antifungal drugs, including in Oxford to fluconazole and related drugs, as well as occasionally amphotericin. _C. auris_ was rarely detected in the general ward environment. However, researchers were able to both culture samples from the medical equipment and see it on the surface of temperature probes using a scanning electron microscope.

They were able to analyse the fungal samples' genetic information and determine that the fungus found on the equipment matched those of the patients' samples. It appears that these fungi were able to survive on the hospital equipment despite hygiene standards in place.

"This reinforces the need to carefully investigate the environment, and in particular multi-use patient equipment, in any unexplained healthcare-associated outbreak," Eyre concluded. The team have successfully controlled the outbreak.

[This _Candida auris_ outbreak in an ICU in the UK reported above reminds me of an outbreak of vancomycin-resistant _Enterococcus faecium_ (VRE) outbreak in our ICU that confronted us in the early 1990's (1).

Environmental surveillance cultures recovered the organism repeatedly from the rectal probe handles of 3 electronic thermometers used exclusively on non-isolated patients in the ICU. At the time, isolated patients who had their own glass thermometers were not involved in the outbreak. Restriction endonuclease analysis of plasmid DNA showed that all clinical and environmental isolates were identical. Infection control measures, including isolation of colonized or infected patients and removal of the rectal thermometer probes that were suspected to be responsible for transmission, resulted in termination of the outbreak. This nosocomial outbreak due to a VRE was the 1st epidemic in which an electronic thermometer has been implicated as the vehicle of transmission for an infectious agent.

Clinical equipment shared among patients, including blood pressure cuffs, stethoscopes, ultrasound probes, tourniquets used in blood collection, pulse oximeter machines, and thermometers, can be a vehicle for cross-transmission of pathogens, and the organisms are able to survive for prolonged periods on these inanimate surfaces (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4676153/). Such equipment should be dedicated for use by a single patient and then decontaminated, if possible, or discarded upon discharge.

_Candida auris_ is a globally emerging, nosocomial, multidrug resistant pathogen associated with a high mortality. Epidemiologic investigations in the U.S. revealed most cases in each state had exposure to common healthcare facilities or had recently received healthcare in other countries and testing in these facilities identified widespread environmental _C. auris_ contamination (mattresses, beds, windowsills, chairs, infusion pumps, and countertops) of patients' rooms.

Genotyping of isolates by whole genome sequencing indicated that isolates were highly related to one another within each state and grouped with isolates from overseas locations: New York isolates grouped in the same clade as isolates from South Asia; New Jersey isolates also grouped with isolates from South Asia, but were distinct from those in New York; and Illinois isolates grouped with isolates from South America. These data suggested multiple introductions of _C. auris_ into the United States followed by local transmission within healthcare settings. - Mod.ML
