Man who breathed in anthrax dies
--------------------------------
A [35 year old] drum maker who inhaled anthrax spores while handling
imported animal skins at his workshop has died in hospital. The man, from
Hackney in east London, had been in the intensive care unit of Homerton
University Hospital for more than a week. A hospital spokesman confirmed he
died from inhalation anthrax not cutaneous anthrax and said his family was
with him when he died. A hospital spokesman said his condition had
deteriorated overnight and that he died on Sunday [2 Nov 2008] afternoon.

Eight other people have been given antibiotics as a precautionary measure.

The Health Protection Agency (HPA) said it is attempting to trace where the
infected skins originated.

The HPA has sealed off his flat in Hackney and will examine his workshop
this week. Its chief adviser, Professor Nigel Lightfoot, said residents who
live near the flat or workshop are not at risk. He stressed that the risk
for coming into contact with anthrax comes from the making of animal skin
drums, not playing or handling them. He said: "We are, however, keen to
reiterate to all individuals who make drums from imported animal skins that
there is a risk of coming into contact with anthrax and that they should
ensure they are aware of this and take precautions to protect themselves
when making these drums."

The threat to the general public is very small as it is extremely unusual
for anthrax to be transmitted from person to person.

The last death of this kind in Britain was in 2006 when a 50 year old
craftsman from Stobs, near Hawick in Scotland, died after inhaling anthrax.
This man made artworks and musical instruments, including drums. A report
from NHS Borders published in December last year [2007] said it was likely
that he contracted the illness after playing or handling
anthrax-contaminated African drums [This differs from the HPA statement
above. - Mod.MHJ]. A fatal accident inquiry into his death is due to take
place on 18 Nov [2008] at Edinburgh Sheriff Court.

Investigators prepare to enter studio where drum maker died of anthrax
----------------------------------------------------------------------
An East London studio was in quarantine today [3 Nov 2008] as investigators
prepared to scour the workshop of a drum maker who died yesterday [2 Nov
2008] after inhaling anthrax. The man is thought to have contracted the
disease from imported animal hides, which he used to make bongo drums.
Health protection officials said that residents are not at risk from the
disease, which is not contagious.

This morning neighbours paid tribute to a generous man who taught music to
local children on the Morningside Estate in Hackney. Jules Pipe, the mayor
of Hackney, said today [3 Nov 2008]: "Our sympathies are with his family
and friends at this very sad time. The council is continuing to work very
closely with the Health Protection Agency (HPA). We want to reassure our
residents that inhalation of anthrax is extremely rare and does not pass
from person to person."

Officials from the Health Protection Agency will enter the workshop
tomorrow [4 Nov 2008], using protective equipment. The site is currently
under guard to ensure that no one enters the studio, but a spokeswoman for
the agency said that there was no risk to residents. Occupants of flats on
the same floor as the studio have been asked to stay away from the building
"for logistical reasons," she said.

Seven other people who had been in the room where the skins were prepared
were given antibiotics as a precautionary measure and the HPA said that
nobody else had developed any symptoms.

The investigation will focus on the animal hides that were used to make
bongo drums. It is thought likely that the anthrax spores may be traced to
hides imported from Africa, where the infection is endemic in animals. Any
hides found in the studio will be removed for testing at a government
laboratory at Porton Down, and results are not expected until next week.

Anthrax spores can be released when infected hides are scraped or otherwise
manipulated during the drum-making process, and breathing in these spores
can lead to infection. But there is very little risk from the finished
drums. "It is important to stress that it is the making of animal skin
drums that is the risk for coming into contact with anthrax rather than
playing or handling drums," Professor Nigel Lightfoot, the HPA's chief
adviser, said.

In Britain, the last similar case occurred in 2006, when a drum-maker from
Hawick in Scotland died after inhaling anthrax. A report concluded that he
picked up the illness from infected West African hides. Only one case has
ever been reported of anthrax being passed on by skin contact with a
finished bongo drum, and this was in Haiti in 1974. Last year [2007] a drum
maker in Connecticut (USA) contracted the more common cutaneous form of
anthrax from contact with untreated West African goat hides.

While all forms of anthrax can be fatal, the disease can be treated
effectively with antibiotics if detected early. Drum makers who work with
untreated hides and develop feverish illness or skin lesions are advised to
contact their GP (general practitioner).

How dangerous is drum making?
-----------------------------
A 2nd drum maker in 2 years has died after apparently inhaling anthrax
spores from animal skins. What are the risks of this seemingly safe job?
Are these cases a coincidence or a cause for alarm?

In the UK, the recent death is the 2nd case in more than 30 years. Across
the world, there are 4 other known cases since 1974 of drum makers dying
from anthrax.

It is difficult however to put these figures into context. There are no
official statistics on the numbers of drum makers and handlers of skins for
drum making in the UK come in many guises -- the amateur attending drumming
workshops, the professional who tends to work independently, members of
African communities who carry out repairs, and the drummer who replaces his
skins himself. African drumming is growing in popularity in the UK, but any
drumming community is informal and loosely-knit.

Health experts do stress though that cases of death from anthrax are
extremely rare among drum makers, and drum players are in no danger at all.

Anthrax is a naturally occurring disease, which can sporadically affect
cattle and goat herds, as well as more exotic animals such as llamas, yaks,
and bison, all around the world. The skins of cows and goats, in
particular, are used to make traditional African drums. Outside of the
African tradition, drum skins are usually more processed and come prepared
without any hair. Most European drums are made from man-made fibres, except
for some antique orchestral drums and the Irish Bodhran, made with goat or
deer skin. Drum makers say hides produce a better sound and are gentler on
the hands.

Dr Phil Luton, of the Health Protection Agency (HPA), said the "vast
majority" of skins imported for drum making would not be infected with
anthrax. Anthrax can be contracted through cuts to the skin (cutaneous
anthrax) or by inhaling the spores (inhalation anthrax), the latter being
the harder to detect and to treat. Drum makers are at risk, however low,
during the preparation of the skin, which involves stretching it over the
frame and scraping hair from the hide to give it a smooth finish. The
danger lies in inhaling agitated spores or an open wound becoming infected.

The HPA says there are no other occupations known to be at risk, as jobs
like rug making are more rigorously regulated.

In the case of drum makers, the HPA advises carrying out work in a
well-ventilated space and to avoid breathing in dust. It says it will be
reviewing its advice once the findings of the investigation are available.

Drum maker John Sullivan, also known as Bodhi, uses the common-sense
approach, which has worked for him for the past 20 years. He makes djembes,
a goblet-shaped West African hand drum, by carving a solid log from
hardwood and covering it with goats' skin imported from Gambia and Senegal.
He says he is careful not to cut himself when shaving bristly hair off with
a double-edged razor blade and has considered wearing rubber gloves. When
rubbing down a bristly skin, he goes outside and checks the wind direction
to ensure any spores blow away from him. The 54 year old, from the Suffolk
coast, said the latest death had made him think twice about his own safety,
but not enough to stop. "I have been doing it 20 years and I'm still here,"
he said.

Investigations following a death from anthrax
---------------------------------------------
Following the announcement of the death of a patient from inhalation
anthrax the Health Protection Agency (HPA) would like to offer its
condolences to the patient's family and friends.

As part of an investigation to identify where the anthrax originated from,
the HPA will be carrying out some testing at the patient's workshop in
Hackney tomorrow [4 Nov 2008]. This will involve a team from the agency who
will wear protective clothing and use a handling tent outside the property.
These are standard procedures when this sort of work is carried out, to
prevent the potential of any transfer of the bacteria.

Dr Brian McCloskey, director of the HPA in the London Region said, "We have
been working with Hackney Council and have spoken to all the residents of
this property. There is no risk to those living in this block of flats, or
the wider residents in the area. The patient's property is currently
secured and there is no-one living there. If this testing reveals the
presence of anthrax spores then we will speak to local residents about this
and specialist cleaning will be carried out to remove any trace of anthrax
from the property.

"We have also been following up any contacts of this patient who may have
been exposed to the anthrax spores by being in the same room when the
animal skins were being prepared and the drums were made. We have so far
given antibiotics to 8 people as a precautionary measure, and none of these
have developed any symptoms of anthrax. It is important to stress that it
is the making of animal skin drums that is the risk for coming into contact
with anthrax rather than playing or handling drums.

"We have stressed to all residents throughout this incident that there is
no risk to their health as a result of the case of anthrax, or the testing
that will be carried out. We are however keen to reiterate to all
individuals who make drums from imported animal skins that there is a risk
of coming into contact with anthrax and that they should ensure they are
aware of this and take precautions to protect themselves when making these
drums"

Notes to editors
----------------
1. There will be an opportunity for media to take photographs prior to the
testing starting on Tuesday [4 Nov 2008]. This will be at 8 am and after
this all media will be requested to leave so that the team can carry out
their work uninterrupted. If you would like to send a photographer then
please contact Emily Collins on 0207 759 2824.
2. Anthrax is a disease caused by spores that live in the environment. It
can cause a skin infection (cutaneous anthrax) or as in this case,
inhalation anthrax, when the spores are inhaled into the lungs. Inhalation
anthrax is very rare and is not passed from person to person. All
individuals who may have been exposed to anthrax spores during the making
of these drums have already been given antibiotics to prevent them from
becoming ill.
3. Despite the popularity of African drumming in the UK and elsewhere over
recent years, no cases of anthrax associated with these activities have
been reported. A single case of cutaneous (skin) anthrax associated with a
goat hide bongo drum purchased in Haiti occurred in 1974: this is the only
such case ever reported.
4. A case of inhalation anthrax occurred in 2006 in America in a man who
made drums from dried (but otherwise untreated) animal hides brought in
from West Africa. A recent case (in August 2006) also occurred in Scotland
in a man who made drums from imported animal hides.
5. Anthrax infections associated with the handling of untanned animal hides
are now extremely rare in the UK. Imported animal hides from countries
where anthrax is endemic in animals (for example, in Africa and Asia) pose
a higher risk for exposure than domestic (UK origin) hides.
6. Strict regulations are in place for the importation of animal hides.

<http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article5070999.ece>

Readers should note that although the patient had been under intense
medical care for a week, he still died from this disease. Once the symptoms
have started it is extremely hard to prevent human deaths from anthrax. So
far there is no information on how or why the patient's GP and the Homerton
University Hospital tumbled to the fact that he had pneumonic anthrax.
Someone was very alert and is to be commended.

Decontaminating such drum making establishments can be quite a challenge.
In spite of the press reports, only the deceased patient's workshop has
been sealed, not his flat (apartment). It would not be surprising if there
were a number of contaminated hides; they usually originate from street
markets in various African towns. While the HPA are not directly
responsible for checking professional and amateur drum making
establishments, they might consider encouraging local authorities to visit
other UK drum makers to check that their hides are healthy. Based on our
extensive field experience with various wildlife species of animals dead
from anthrax the Porton examinations should include PCR [polymerase chain
reaction] checks of the hides as culturing can and does, not infrequently,
come up with false negatives.

Whatever claims are made about controlling the entry of sun dried hides
from Africa and elsewhere it is clear that the present procedures need to
be revisited as well as the luggage inspection of UK tourists returning
from West Africa, and of West Africans visiting relatives in the UK. DEFRA
(UK Department for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs) are responsible
for the control of imported hides. - Mod.MHJ]
