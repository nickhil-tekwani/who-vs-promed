[1] Phnom Penh, 6th case, fatal

A 3-year-old boy from capital Phnom Penh's Por Senchey district has died of H5N1 human avian influenza earlier this month [March 2014], said a joint statement from the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Cambodian Health Ministry Friday [7 Mar 2014].

"The boy died on [2 Mar 2014] after being admitted to the National Pediatric Hospital for 3 days," the statement said. The boy had onset symptoms of fever, cough, running nose and vomiting on [22 Feb 2014] and his parents sent him to the National Pediatric Hospital on [28 Feb 2014] after his condition worsened.

The boy became the 6th person infected with the virus in 2014.

The statement said in mid-February [2014], over 90 percent of the chickens and small number of ducks suddenly died in the boy's village, and the boy often went to the house of a neighbor whose poultry died.

Bird flu remains a serious threat to the health of all Cambodians, and children seem to be the most vulnerable, Health Minister Mam Bunheng said.

"I urge parents and guardians to keep children away from sick or dead poultry and make sure children wash their hands with soap and water after any contact with poultry," he said.

H5N1 influenza is a flu that normally spreads between sick poultry, but it can sometimes spread from poultry to human beings, according to the WHO.

The virus was 1st identified in Cambodia 10 years ago. To date [7 Mar 2014], the country has reported 53 human cases of the virus, killing 35 people, the statement said.

[2] Phnom Penh - MOH report

The Ministry of Health (MoH) of the Kingdom of Cambodia wishes to advise members of the public that one new human case of avian influenza has been confirmed for the H5N1 virus. This is the 6th case this year [2014] and the 53rd person to become infected with the H5N1 virus in Cambodia. The case is from Phnom Penh City. Of the 53 confirmed cases, 41 were children under 14, and 29 of the 53 were female. In addition, since the 1st case happened in Cambodia in 2005, only 18 cases have survived.

A 3-year-old boy from Prey Lyea village, Sangkat Chom-Chao commune, Khan Por-SenChey district, Phnom Penh province, was detected by the National Institute of Public Health (NIPH) on [3 Mar 2014] and confirmed positive by lnstitut Pasteur du Cambodge (IPC) on [3 Mar 2014]. The boy had onset symptoms of fever, cough, running nose and vomiting on [22 Feb 2014]. His parents sought treatment at a private clinic on the same day. His condition worsened and the boy was admitted to National Pediatric Hospital (NPH) on [28 Feb 2014]. On [2 Mar 2014], the boy had symptoms of fever, cough, running nose, vomiting, dyspnea, and cyanoses and was transferred to Calmette Hospital on the same day. The boy died about one hour after his admission on [2 Mar 2014].

Around mid-February [2014], over 90 percent of the chickens and small number of ducks suddenly died in the village. The boy was often going to a neighbour's house where their poultry died. The relatives reported that the boy had no direct contact, but the chickens died in close proximity to the house of the case.

"Avian influenza H5N1 remains a serious threat to the health of all Cambodians and more so for children, who seem to be most vulnerable and are at high risk. There have been 53 cases of H5N1 infection in humans since 2005, and here is the 6th case of this year [2014]. Children often care for domestic poultry by feeding them, cleaning pens and gathering eggs. Children may also have closer contact with poultry as they often treat [the birds] as pets, and also seem to be most vulnerable and are at high risk because they like to play where poultry are found. I urge parents and guardians to keep children away from sick or dead poultry and prevent then from playing with chickens and ducks. Parents and guardians must also make sure children thoroughly wash their hands with soap and water before eating and after any contact with poultry. Hands may carry the virus that cannot be seen by the naked eye. Soap washes away the virus on hands. If children have fast or difficult breathing, their parents should seek medical attention at the nearest health facility, and attending physicians must be made aware of any exposure to sick or dead poultry," said H.E. Dr. Mam Bunheng, Minister of Health.

[According to the most recent WHO update on H5N1 infections dated 25 Feb 2014, there have been 8 cases of human infection with influenza A(H1N5) in 2014, of which 5 were reported in Cambodia. "Cambodia reported 5 confirmed and 1 probable case of human infection with influenza A(H5N1) virus. All cases were children: a 5-year-old boy from Kampong Thom, and 3 cases from the same village in Kratie province: an 8-year-old boy and his 2-year-old sister (probable case) and a 4-year-old boy. The siblings died from severe respiratory infection, but samples were collected only from the 8-year-old boy. The 4-year-old boy was detected during the contact tracing around this family cluster. Exposure of the last 3 children to a common poultry source is likely as a high number of poultry were reported to have died in the village in mid-January [2014], and all had direct exposure to dead and sick poultry. The last 2 reported cases were a 10-year-old girl and an 11-year-old girl from 2 different districts in Kampong Cham province. Both presented with mild disease and fully recovered. Poultry die-off was reported in their neighbourhood" (from http://who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/Influenza_Summary_IRA_HA_interface_25Feburary14.pdf).

All cases thus far this year (2014) were in children, all of whom had a history of exposure to poultry or resided in proximity to known poultry die-offs.
