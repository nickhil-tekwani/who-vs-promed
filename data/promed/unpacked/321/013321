Scientists reported on Wednesday they have found the first direct link
between drinking water and stomach ulcers.
The finding came from tests done on wells and other water sources in
Pennsylvania where the bacterium _Helicobacter pylori_ was found. The
bacterium is known to cause certain gastric ulcers.
The report from Pennsylvania State University in Harrisburg said interviews
with residents who consumed the water found a statistically significant
correlation between presence of the bacteria and cases of stomach ulcers.
Katherine Baker who led the research said drinking water is generally
considered safe when coliform bacteria are not present. But the
ulcer-causing bacteria were found in coliform-free water samples, she said.
"What this really means is that our current methods for testing drinking
water may be saying that water is fine while _H. pylori_ may actually be
present," she said.
The research, released at a meeting of the American Society for
Microbiology, was described by the authors as the first to "demonstrate a
direct link between contaminated drinking water and stomach ulcers."
Baker said the study involved private, untreated water supplies and not
municipal water sources, which are less likely to contain the organism.
