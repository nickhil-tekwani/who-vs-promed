From the beginning of the year [2021] through [7 Nov 2021], health officials in Zimbabwe reported 212 human anthrax cases. No deaths have been reported. The latest cases were reported in early November [2021] -- in Gokwe North District (2), Gokwe South District (4) in Midlands Province, Goromonzi District (1) in Mashonaland East Province, Hurungwe District (1) and Makonde District (1) in Mashonaland West Province [9 cases total].

The anthrax outbreak started in September 2019 affecting mainly Buhera and Gokwe North and South districts. Since the start of the outbreak, 979 cases, including 3 deaths have been reported.

There are no reports of person-to-person transmission of anthrax. People get anthrax by handling contaminated animal or animal products, consuming undercooked meat of infected animals and more recently, intentional release of spores.

Anthrax is a bacterial pathogen in livestock and wild animals. Ruminants such as bison, cattle, sheep and goats are highly susceptible, and horses can also be infected. Anthrax is a very serious disease of livestock because it can potentially cause the rapid loss of a large number of animals in a very short time. Affected animals are often found dead with no illness detected.

When conditions become favorable, the spores germinate into colonies of bacteria. An example would be a grazing cow ingests spores that in the cow, germinate, grow, spread and eventually kill the animal. Anthrax is caused by the bacterium, _Bacillus anthracis_. This spore-forming bacteria can survive in the environment for decades because of its ability to resist heat, cold, drying, etc. This is usually the infectious stage of anthrax.

[To date there have been no reports of anthrax, whether in humans or livestock, in Zimbabwe during 2021.

The poor reporting is hard to explain. But it should be noted that if this severe epidemic started in September 2019, it was not reported. The previous report was for 7 Jul 2019, and the next for 18 Nov 2019. We had 16 reports for 2020. Zimbabwe is experienced in the proper control & surveillance of this disease. That this report has specific numbers of human cases for 2019-2021 means that there was a reporting system in place. But clearly inadequate disease control, especially in livestock as that is the major source of human infections. - Mod.MHJ
