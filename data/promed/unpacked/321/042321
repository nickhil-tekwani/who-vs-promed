The regional health official announced the closure of a water fountain
in Alcasser, in the south of Valencia province, on Monday [25 Jul
2011] after 10 cases of legionnaire's disease were detected on Friday
[22 Jul 2011].

Five of the 10 were admitted to hospital, although it's understood
that the only patient who had to be admitted to intensive care has now
been transferred to the wards. All 5 are said to be making good
progress at the Doctor Peset Hospital in Valencia City.

Health official Luis Rosado told Europa Press that the fountain has
been closed as a 1st measure while investigations continue to confirm
it as the source of the outbreak or other possible origins of the
infection.

[For a discussion of legionellosis, see ProMED-mail post Legionellosis
- Spain (05): Madrid 20101115.4142. Dr Steve Berger has noted that
rates of legionellosis have been increasing in Spain
(http://www.gideononline.com/2010/06/12/legionellosis-in-spain/). It
is unknown if this is due to increased reporting or an actual increase
in acquisition of this infection.

Alcasser, with a population of about 8900 in 2008, is a municipality
in the province of Valencia, situated along the Mediterranean coast in
the Valencian Community, one of 17 autonomous communities in Spain
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcasser). The HealthMap/ProMED-mail
