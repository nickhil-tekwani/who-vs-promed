Officials confirm plague caused death in domestic cat
--------------------------------------
State health officials in Colorado confirmed on
Friday [25 May 2007] that the death of a domestic cat was caused by plague.
"While a case of cat plague is a public health
concern, this is not an uncommon finding in areas
where plague is circulating," said John Pape, an
epidemiologist who specializes in animal-related
diseases for the Disease Control and
Environmental Epidemiology Division at the
Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment.
So far this year [2007], at least 15 squirrels
have tested positive for plague in the [Denver]
metro area. Additionally, a rabbit at City Park
in Denver also tested positive for plague, and a
monkey from the Denver Zoo was confirmed to have
died from the bacteria. Pape says plague was
found in wild animals in 25 different Colorado counties last year [2006].
State health officials say cats are very
susceptible to contracting plague because they
will commonly eat rodents which were infected.
Pape says last year, 23 cats were diagnosed with
plague. Officials say cats infected with plague
become extremely ill and have many of the same
symptoms humans do: high fever, severe lethargy and swollen lymph nodes.
If you think your cat has been infected, you are
advised to contact a veterinarian. Dogs are
generally resistant to plague, but can bring
infected fleas into the home, according to state
health officials. Officials say most human plague
cases occur from infected fleabites, but can also
result from direct contact with blood of an infected animal.
