Latvia: army staff battalion affected by suspected food poisoning
-----------------------------------------------
The NAS press agency reported today [Mon 24 Jan 2005] that about 40
servicemen of a staff battalion of the National Armed Forces of Latvia
(NVS) required medical attention at the end of last week. On Fri 21 Jan
2005, 2 service men attended the staff battalion first-aid post complaining
of nausea and vomiting. More soldiers became ill during the night, and at
the present time, 26 servicemen are being treated in the Latvian Infectious
Disease Center, and another 12 in their unit.
Specialists from the Army Medical Service, the Army Supply Service, the
Public Health Service, the Veterinary Service, the Sanitary Investigation
Branch and the Center of Emergency Medicine have begun investigation of
this outbreak. Foodstuffs are being subjected to laboratory analysis.
This is not a unique case of food poisoning in the Latvian army. In January
2001, more than 100 soldiers of the Elgavskiy battalion, a unit of the
Ministry of Internal Affairs, were ill with dysentery. In January 2003, 72
soldiers were ill with an intestinal infection in the Aluksnenskiy mobile
artillery battalion.

[3] USA (Florida) - suspected norovirus outbreak terminates cruise early

USA: suspected norovirus outbreak terminates cruise early
-----------------------------------------------
A Tampa-based cruise ship returned to port 12 hours early on Friday [28 Jan
2005], after a viral gastroenteritis outbreak made 204 passengers sick. A
Holland America Line spokeswoman said that the MS Veendam returned to port
on Friday afternoon, instead of Saturday morning, so it could undergo
"rigorous cleaning before Saturday's 5:00 p.m. departure." All 1220
passengers were offered USD 125 to USD 250 in compensation, according to
the spokeswoman.
Rose Abello, Holland America Line Spokesperson, stated that: "Some people
on the ship are sick, but this is not a sick ship." Before boarding,
passengers say they were warned some customers on the previous sailing had
become ill. While they were offered full refunds if they chose not to
travel, some claim they were not told about the extent of the problem.
According to Abello, 77 passenger and crew got sick on the last sailing.
Abello describes the sickness as a stomach-flu. Samples are being sent to
the Centers for Disease Control for testing. In November 2002, a different
Holland America ship was taken out of service, after more than 500
passengers contracted norovirus infection over the course of 4 sailings.

[4] USA (Oregon) - norovirus suspected as cause of outbreaks in prisons

USA: norovirus suspected as cause of outbreaks in prisons in Oregon
-----------------------------------------------
Prison physicians suspect an outbreak of norovirus infection [beginning on]
Tue 25 Jan 2005 has sickened at least 128 inmates at Oregon State
Penitentiary and at a neighboring minimum-security facility in Salem. To
prevent the spread of the painful intestinal illness, prison health
officers are looking into possible causes and urging inmates to give
greater attention to personal hygiene.
The 1st inmates showed symptoms, including stomach cramps, nausea, vomiting
and diarrhea, on Tuesday [25 Jan 2005], said Steve Shelton, Department of
Corrections medical director. "If it is, indeed, a norovirus, as we
suspect, it is very contagious," Shelton said. "We are cautioning inmates
and staff to wash their hands frequently, cover their coughs and sneezes,
and limit contact with others." People can be infected with the norovirus
by ingesting stool-contaminated food or water, or by having contact with a
person who is infected.
Stool samples from inmates have been sent to a lab for testing so prison
officials can determine what virus the inmates have. But there may be no
way to determine how the virus was introduced into the inmate population,
prison officials said.
Norovirus symptoms, which also include fever, chills and headache,
generally last a day or 2. The outbreak is the 2nd in less than a year that
authorities have blamed on norovirus. In May [2004], physicians treated 33
inmates with an intestinal virus at the Snake River Correctional
Institution in Malheur County.

[5] Canada - 15-fold increase in norovirus infection in under a decade

Canada: incidence of norovirus infection increased 15-fold in under a decade
-----------------------------------------------
Cases of [norovirus infection] have jumped an astounding 15-fold in Canada
in the past 7 years. Part of the increase may be attributed to more people
reporting the illness to their doctors. It is not a reportable disease,
meaning health authorities do not need to be notified of cases, making it
more difficult to track than influenza. Noroviruses thrives wherever people
congregate. They cause diarrhea, vomiting, light-headedness, dizziness and
headache. No one is immune.
Since last year [2004], outbreaks have been reported on cruise ships in the
Caribbean, resorts in the Dominican Republic, as well as less exotic
locales like nursing homes, hospitals and day-care centers in Canada. The
problem is that noroviruses are highly infectious; it takes just 10 virus
particles to make someone sick [i.e. to initiate infection - Mod.CP]. Since
the virus spreads from hand to mouth, it can be picked up from shaking
hands, touching contaminated surfaces or eating contaminated food. "You'd
be surprised the number of times each day that we actually touch our mouths
with our fingers," said Dr. Paul Sockett, Public Health Agency of Canada in
Ottawa. "There is a high chance that you can transfer the virus to
yourself." Food handlers in restaurants and cruise ships often take the
blame for outbreaks, but it's just as likely to be a patron or passenger
who brings the virus into the setting. "We don't know who the culprit was
that brought it into the family," said Dr. Tony Muzzulli, a virus expert at
Toronto's Mount Sinai Hospital, who fell victim to the virus in his own
home. "We do know that there were a lot of people visiting ... during the
holidays."
Dehydration from the virus can be serious in the very old and very young,
but most people recover after a few days. There is no vaccine and no
treatment for the illness, although doctors say the best way to protect
yourself is frequent hand washing. Those who are sick should stay at home.
