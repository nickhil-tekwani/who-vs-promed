[This reports definitely represents an uptick in the rate of spread
of this disease. It summarizes 10 outbreaks between 19 and 28 Feb
2007. Previously, there had been a number of other updates since the
initial outbreak on 7 Jul 2006. These reports generally contained one
or 2 infected farms. Please see the full WAHID interface reports at
the source given above for details of all 12 reports.
There is enough concern that the disease is getting out of control so
that we have reports of intensive, active surveillance in nearby
Slovenia. They have already surveyed 112 farms with around 2000 pigs
and plan to put 18 veterinarians on examining an additional 550 farms
by 15 Mar 2007. Clearly, there is some concern along the border. A
glance at the map of outbreak locations reveals that the 28 outbreaks
to date have occurred in different areas of the country. Given all
this, it would be useful to have any authoritative account of the
progress of the eradication campaign.
The other problematic item in this notification is the indication of
swine movement and swill feeding to pigs. Each of these conditions
work directly against effective control strategies. Cessation of the
feeding of uncooked garbage was one of the preconditions for the
eradication of classical swine fever (hog cholera) from the United
States in 1978. Moreover, it is unclear how successful the animal
health authorities have been in stopping movement of swine, as that
is cited as one of the reasons for the current spread. All in all,
the picture doesn't look good, so any detailed updates would be
appreciated. Descriptions of clinical signs and pathology can be
found at USAHA's Gray Book on Foreign Animal Diseases at
