Unauthorized vaccine may have caused hog cholera
--------------------------------------------------
Unauthorized vaccination may have caused hog cholera antibodies in blood
samples from pigs at a farm in Kagoshima Prefecture, prefectural officials
said Monday.
"We think the antibodies were created through the use of a vaccine and
cannot believe the pigs were infected from outside," a Kagoshima official
said, referring to the pigs suspected to have the disease, also known as
swine fever.

[In the previous posting in this thread (referenced below), it was alleged
that the serologically suspected pig farm had applied vaccination in
November 2000. The question is whether, in fact, a later -- illegal --
vaccination has been applied. If affirmative, it is important to note
whether a modified live virus (MLV) vaccine was used or "marker vaccines".
The latter will induce antibodies that can be distinguished from antibodies
induced by field virus. - Mod.AS]
