With the addition of 2 cases of mucormycosis infection in patients at Hong Kong's Queen Mary Hospital during the past few weeks, this brings the number of mucormycosis cases to 5 so far in 2015 at the hospital, prompting an investigation, according to the Hong Kong Hospital Authority (computer translated).

2 patients have died after being infected with the fungus _Rhizopus_; however, it is unclear if this was the cause of death. Secretary for
Food and Health Dr Ko Wing-man said that investigators initially suspected the fungal infections were related to bed sheets and patient's clothes because the fungus was found on the skin of all 5 patients. The 5 stayed in different wards so bodily contact was not likely to be the source of transmission, he said. In some of the cases the fungus was also found in the respiratory tract of the patients.

Zygomycosis, or mucormycosis, is an acute fungal infection from a number of genera of molds, _Rhizopus_ being the most frequently encountered. Infections with these fungi typically cause disease that is rapidly progressive, destructive and associated with a high fatality rate of 50 percent or higher. It is most prevalent in those with a weakened immune system or other debilitating disease like diabetes. These fungi have an affinity for blood vessels and cause thrombosis, infarction and tissue necrosis. It is not communicable from person to person.

[It will be important to prepare a map of the hospital wards and where the cases developed as well as a timeline of the cases. Finding the mold in respiratory cultures and skin suggests aerosolization of spores which may occur with construction. This post does not state whether construction was ongoing in or around the facility.

The following moderation was prepared by my colleague Mod.ML for the original posting of this case in November 2014:

Mucormycosis (also called zygomycosis) is the name given to infections caused by _Mucorales_ (http://www.cdc.gov/fungal/diseases/mucormycosis/). Pathogenic genera in the Mucoraceae family include _Absidia_, _Apophysomyces_, _Mucor_, _Rhizomucor_, and _Rhizopus_. These fungi are ubiquitous in the environment, such as in soil and decaying vegetable matter. Although most individuals are exposed to these fungi daily, usually mucormycosis occurs in individuals with predisposing medical conditions such as immunosuppression and diabetic ketoacidosis. However, necrotizing soft tissue mucormycoses have been described in immunocompetent individuals as a result of traumatic injuries following tornados, tsunamis, and volcanic eruptions (see ProMED-mail post Mucormycosis, fatal - USA: (MO) tornado-related 20110612.1789).

Most human infections result from inhalation of fungal spores that have been released into the air or from direct inoculation of organisms into disrupted skin or mucosa. _Mucorales_ species are angioinvasive, causing infarction of the involved tissue, and the mucormycosis spectrum ranges from cutaneous, gastrointestinal, rhinocerebral, and sinopulmonary to disseminated and frequently fatal infections, especially in immunocompromised hosts, such as premature neonates, solid organ transplant recipients, and those with hematological malignancies.

Healthcare-acquired mucormycosis has been associated with a variety of procedures or devices, such as cutaneous infection related to the direct inoculation of the fungus on the wound or skin surfaces, ingestion of contaminated material, or inhalation of aerosolized fungal spores (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1469-0691.2009.02982.x/full). Specific examples include use of contaminated wound bandages; contaminated hospital linen; contaminated adhesive on ostomy bags; contaminated medication patches; contaminated wooden tongue depressors used to prepare oral medications given to patients through a nasogastric tube or tongue depressors used to construct splints for intravenous and arterial cannulation sites; and aerosolized fungal spores in ventilatory systems as a result of construction (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1469-0691.2009.02982.x/full). - Mod.LL
