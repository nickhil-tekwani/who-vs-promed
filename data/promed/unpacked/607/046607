Last Sunday the Americas Vaccination Campaign against measles and
rubella started, which will last until the end of May [2006]. It is
estimated that 4 million children and teenagers will be immunized,
from [ages] 6 months to 17 years old. This activity, which is an
initiative from the Health Ministers from the Andean region that was
approved by the Directive Council of the World Health Organization,
was to be initiated next 23 Apr [2006], but it commenced earlier in
the Capital District and Miranda State because of the current
2-week-long measles outbreak, according to the Vice Minister for
Collective Health, Jose Mendoza, who attended La Dolorita People's
Clinic in Sucre Municipality, where the campaign was initiated.
According to Dr. Mendoza, "the measles outbreak registered in the
Metropolitan Area is under control. Until now, 23 cases have been
detected, 21 of them from Miranda State and 2 from Libertador
Municipality".
He assured that there have been no confirmed cases nationally.
However, he pointed out that "we have some suspected cases in
Trujillo State, where a case coming from Miranda area; in Zulia a
couple of cases are under investigation, and in Nueva Esparta 4
suspected cases are under evaluation".
Considering the Holy Week holiday, the Vice Minister of Health
clarified that the measles immunization certificate is not being
required in various transportation facilities, such as airports and
bus stations.
"The main measure that we are taking during this holiday period is to
intensify epidemiological surveillance. This means that health
modules with early detection systems have been placed in vacation
areas, so that any person with fever or skin rash is taken care of
immediately", stated Mr. Mendoza.
He indicated that in this season's vaccination campaign, all health
personnel, workers from bus stations and airports, as well as
everyone working during the Holy Week campaign is mandatorily
immunized.
Miranda under surveillance
------------
Only in Miranda State, where the current outbreak originated, 400 000
doses of vaccine have been administered since 17 Mar [2006],
according to Dr. Africa Ramos, epidemiologist and coordinator of the
7th MSDS [Ministry of Health and Social development, according to its
Spanish initials] District, comprising Chacao, Sucre, Baruta, and El
Gatillo Municipalities.
She explained that even though this Americas Vaccination Campaign
will be maintained until the end of May [2006], in Miranda
immunization will continue until all cases or suspected cases are
eradicated [while that is a direct translation of the Spanish text,
the implication is that immunization activities will continue until
transmission of the measles virus is interrupted in Venezuela -
Mod.MPP].
According to Dr. Ramos, there are currently 150 000 doses available,
enough to immunize the entire population of the metropolitan area.
Dr. Ramos commented that in spite of the fact that the Miranda region
was where the outbreak started, "there was some reluctance against
vaccination in A and B sectors in the population, where the cases
come from. But now, thanks to the information campaign, people are
aware of the risks posed by the disease, and now we are facing an
overwhelming demand for immunization".
She said that in poor areas this problem had not occurred "since
people are quite willing to be immunized". She pointed out that,
because of the aforementioned reluctance, "the worst vaccination
coverage was registered in Baruta, 6 percent; which means that 94
percent of its population was not immunized". [A word of caution in
interpretation of this comment. The source of data on vaccination
coverage is not given. If the information is drawn from what we
refer to as "administrative figures", that means that the public
health clinics providing immunizations in Baruta have administered
vaccines to approximately 6 percent of their estimated target
population (the childhood population targeted for measles
vaccinations). If this is a high-income area, it is quite likely
that children are being immunized by the private sector, and those
immunization numbers might not show up in the administrative figures.
A more accurate assessment would be obtained through a vaccination
coverage survey in the area. - Mod.MPP]

[According to the most recent Measles information available on the
Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) website,
(<http://www.paho.org/English/AD/FCH/IM/sme1213.pdf>) for the week
ending 1 Apr 2006, there have been a total of 47 cases of measles
with laboratory confirmation in the Americas. Of these 47 cases, 21
have been in Venezuela, 22 in Mexico, one in Canada and 3 in the USA.
Classification of these cases by infection source has one of the
cases in Venezuela reported as imported, and 20 cases in Venezuela
are considered import-related (local transmission tracing all cases
back to the imported case); all of the remaining cases in the
Americas (22 in Mexico, one in Canada and 3 in the USA) are
classified as imported cases.
The Vaccination Week in the Americas (VWA)
(<http://www.paho.org/English/DD/PIN/vw_2006.htm>) is scheduled for
the week of 22-29 Apr 2006, as a regional initiative to increase
vaccination coverages. According to the guidelines for the countries
(available at the earlier given link): "Countries choose what
vaccines their campaigns will focus on, and each sets their own goals
based on their priorities. For VWA 2006, Bolivia will start their
national campaign to eliminate rubella and congenital rubella
syndrome. Bolivia's focus will be over 3.8 million men and women 15
to 39 years of age. Venezuela will conduct its follow-up campaign on
measles and rubella by vaccinating over 2.2 million children 1 to 4
years of age, going door-to-door and utilizing fixed posts. Uruguay
will also vaccinate 200 000 children in the same age group against
measles and rubella." From the above newswire, it appears as though
Venezuela has decided to move the date of the campaign up in order to
interrupt the ongoing transmission of measles virus.
The above newswire mentions a total of 23 cases, 3 more than in the
prior ProMED-mail posting on this outbreak. Given the circulation
related to the imported case, until a major vaccination campaign is
completed, one expects to see additional cases of measles. The
Americas have virtually interrupted autochthonous transmission of
measles virus, with all cases reported so far in 2006 as imported or
importation-related. Hopefully Venezuela will be able to interrupt
transmission soon. Unless there is a major increase in the number of
cases and geographical regions involved in transmission of the
measles virus, this thread is now cut. - Mod.MPP]
