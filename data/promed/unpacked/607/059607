Briefing on the initial stage of HPAI Control in Mainland China
-------------------------------------------------
The first HPAI case in China was confirmed in Long'an County of
Guangxi Province on 27 Jan 2004. Afterwards, 49 cases consecutively
occurred in 16 mainland provinces, while 143 100 poultry were
affected by the disease, 127 600 died, and 9.0163 million were
culled. As of 19 Mar 2004 there have been no new epidemic reports in
China for 32 consecutive days. And cordons on epidemic areas have
been lifted.
HPAI has been effectively controlled, no human infection has been
reported, and the production and living of the people have been
restored to normal. All of these mark the success of the initial
stage of HPAI Control in China.
The Chinese Government attached great importance to HPAI prevention
and control. The State Council has established the National HPAI
Prevention and Control Headquarters, which coordinated and commanded
prevention and control work in a unified manner across China, while
local governments also set up corresponding steering agencies in a
timely fashion to organize the culling, prevention, and control of
the epidemic.
The basic experience of HPAI prevention and control in China can be
summarized as: strong leadership, close coordination, firm reliance
on science and laws, prevention and control by mobilizing the masses,
and decisive intervention.
Major measures adopted include the following:
1. Emergent arrangements were made and contingency plans were
formulated and initiated in a timely fashion. The Chinese Government
promulgated the National Contingency Plan for HPAI, which clarifies
epidemic reporting, confirmation, grading, contingency commanding
system, responsibilities of departments, control measures, and
guarantee measures.
The Technical Standards for Handling HPAI Epidemic were formulated,
which regulated the diagnosis of HPAI and culling of poultry,
bio-safety disposal, sealing off of epidemic areas, disinfection, and
protection of personnel.
2. Epidemic was controlled [at the point of outbreaks] so as to
strictly prevent the disease from spreading further.
In areas where the epidemic occurred, all fowl within a 3-km radius
of the [outbreak] were culled and bio-safety disposal was
implemented; compulsory vaccination was carried out within 5
kilometers surrounding the epidemic area; all trading markets of
poultry and its products within 10 kilometers surrounding the
epidemic areas were closed down; and large-scale disinfection was
undertaken [at the points of outbreaks], epidemic areas, and areas at
the risk. Active prevention efforts were carried out in non-epidemic
areas; disinfection was strengthened; monitoring of epidemic and
quarantine and supervision over live poultry and its products were
reinforced to prevent importation of the epidemic. Meanwhile,
examination and inspection of related goods at entry-exit ports were
strengthened; importation of poultry and related products from
countries and regions where the epidemic occurred was ceased;
[vigilance against] smuggling in frontier areas was strengthened.
Exportation of poultry and related products from the epidemic areas
was also suspended.
3. Scientific and technological research to tackle the epidemic were
strengthened while relying on science and technology for effective
prevention and control.
In 1997, when HPAI broke out in Hong Kong SAR, the Chinese Government
immediately organized experts from multiple disciplines to research
the available prevention and control technologies. [An attenuated
strain of] H5N2 virus was imported from international reference
laboratories. In line with the requirements of OIE, research on
diagnosis, reagent, and vaccine production technologies was
undertaken so as to provide production and technology reserves. Thus
far in 2004, after the occurrence of the epidemic in the mainland,
research on production and approval of new vaccines has been
accelerated, and 2 new advanced vaccines produced through genetic
engineering were approved for production.
4. Input was increased and supportive policies were implemented in
the poultry industry. The Chinese government subsidizes culling and
compulsory vaccination. Epidemic surveillance and development of a
prevention system have been strengthened; material reserves for
epidemic prevention have been increased and necessary [equipment has
been acquired]. Meanwhile, support to poultry farmers and processing
enterprises was strengthened, and favorable policies in loans,
discounted interest rates, and taxation were implemented.
5. Dissemination and popularization of scientific knowledge was
reinforced to increase public awareness regarding prevention and
control of the disease. Expert groups were organized to go to
epidemic areas and key production areas to actively engage in
technical consultation, exchange, and training. Various information
dissemination activities were carried out to strengthen the awareness
of the public about HPAI prevention. According to surveys, 98.6
percent of farmers were informed about HPAI, while 77.2 percent of
farmer households responded that they were aware of the symptoms of
HPAI, and 90 percent of farmer households knew that HPAI could be
transmitted to humans. Through adoption of various integrated
prevention and control measures, at present, HPAI has been completed
wiped out in Mainland China, and the success of the initial stage of
the program has been achieved.
We should, however, clearly recognize that the situation is still
grave for disease prevention and control. In light of the spreading
patterns of animal epidemics, we may suffer a relapse of HPAI unless
preventive measures are strengthened. This is because:
a) there are still water fowl that carry the virus;
b) with the weather warming up in most parts of the north, migratory
birds will fly northwards on a large scale, which may result in
spread of the pathogen;
c) there will be more chances for trans-regional spread of the
disease, as there will be more long-distance transportation of
poultry and substantial replenishment of birds in poultry production;
d) the disease still exists in some countries or regions surrounding
China, hence the risk of the disease spreading into China exists;
e) the tremendous difficulty encountered in disease prevention and
control has not been overcome at [its source], since poultry
production in China is a large industry covering extension areas, and
many [areas have little capability for] disease control. Therefore,
relevant departments and local governments are closely monitoring the
epidemic, undertaking epidemiological studies in the 49 epidemic
spots and monitoring the epidemic in key areas so as to prevent
resurgence of the disease.
In the future, I [see note below] will continue to timely inform OIE
of HPAI prevention and control in China, and I hope that exchanges
and cooperation with OIE will be intensified accordingly.

[This report to the OIE, from an unnamed Chinese official (previous
reports were signed by Dr Shen Zhenzhao, Director General, Bureau of
Animal Husbandry and Health, Ministry of Agriculture, Beijing)
demonstrates a commendable, increasing level of transparency.
Clearly, an impressive and substantial effort has been put forth by
the Chinese authorities during recent months in order to prevent
infections in humans and control the epizootic, which has covered
more than half of China's huge territory. The relatively low number
of reported foci and of culled animals might be, in significant part,
due to mass vaccinations, which may have prevented clinical
manifestation of HPAI. However, the statement "HPAI has been
complete[ly] wiped out in Mainland China" is in need of further
substantiation, since the circulation of the virus might not have
been arrested by the vaccine.
It would be helpful if the Chinese authorities provided more details
on the number, dissemination, and results of epidemiological
investigations, number and rate of farms visited, samples collected,
laboratory tests performed, and their results.
It will also be useful to obtain clear and detailed information about
the Chinese vaccines: the one which has reportedly been widely
applied ("H5N2 weak virus strain, imported from international
reference laboratories"), and the new ones ("2 new vaccines of
international advanced level produced through gene engineering,
approved for production"). Reference is made to the recommendations
of an FAO/OIE/WHO Technical Consultation on the Control of Avian
Influenza, held in Rome on 3-4 Feb 2004, which included, among
others, the following:
- "The use of vaccination must be seen as a tool to maximise
biosecurity, be coupled to surveillance to promptly detect any change
in virus properties (antigenic change), and must be carried out with
appropriate products manufactured and quality-controlled to ensure
compliance with international standards as referred in the OIE Manual
of Standards".
- "Vaccination can be used either as a tool to support eradication or
as a tool to control the disease and reduce the viral load in the
environment. Controlling the disease through vaccination may be a
prelude to eradication".
These remarks are specifically applicable to the Chinese HPAI
situation and control policy. - Mod.AS]
