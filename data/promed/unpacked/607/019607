[It is not clear if the source of this outbreak is related to a food handler in the restaurant or just from the food brought in. If an acutely infected food handler is the source, routine immunization of food services workers could have avoided the cluster of cases.

Finestrat is a coastal municipality in the Marina Baixa part in the province of Alicante in the Valencian Community in Spain. - Mod.LL]
