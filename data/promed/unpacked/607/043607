The difficult growing season so far encountered by brassica growers
is set to become even worse with high levels of leaf disease
prevalent this year [2007], reports Andy Richardson of the Allium &
Brassica Centre (ABC). Localised pockets of ringspot, light leaf
spot, and _Phoma_ are all beginning to cause unsightly leaf spots,
but more worryingly _Xanthomonas_ has already been identified, with
the major potential to cause real problems in the months ahead, he
warns. "Wet soil conditions have put plantings well behind normal,
and continuity of supply is going to be a huge issue for the brassica
supply chain." he advises.
Mr Richardson highlights that _Xanthomonas_ bacterial infection can
cause significant losses in marketable yield, with cabbage and late
autumn cauliflower particularly badly affected. He aims to combat the
impending problem through improved control of ringspot, _Alternaria_,
and _Phoma_, which seem to make plants more susceptible to
_Xanthomonas_ infection. "Although fungicides have no direct effect
on the bacteria, our experience in trials is that the enhanced
control of leaf fungal diseases has a significant effect on reducing
the damage from _Xanthomonas_," he says.
Ringspot remains the most important leaf disease in Lincolnshire.
Light leaf spot, although hitherto only a real problem in Scotland,
has been found as far south as Lincolnshire this year [2007] due to
the wet conditions and increase in oilseed rape cultivation, reports
Mr Richardson. "We are also predicting a risk of early and intensive
attacks of _Phoma_ this season," he adds. Wet soils and morning dew
could be sufficient to trigger _Phoma_ spore release from the high
level of stem cankers on recently harvested oilseed rape stubbles.
Monitoring of brassica diseases by the ABC for the Brassica SMS
disease forecasting service has identified the combination of weather
conditions and infective spore release to create an exceptionally
accurate assessment of disease risk for _Alternaria_ and ringspot.
"Difenoconazole will improve control of both ringspot and
_Alternaria_ in brassicas, and gave good protectant control of white
blister in ABC trials last year [2006]," according to Mr Richardson.
He believes the synergistic combination of pre-mixed azoxystrobin and
difenoconazole brings significant added benefits over the 2
individual components -- particularly with enhanced effects seen on
powdery mildew. "We recommend that a rigorous fungicide programme is
maintained by all growers on susceptible crops, in conjunction with
use of the Brassica SMS disease forecasting service to maximise returns."

[The bacterium _Xanthomonas campestris_ pv. _campestris_ is the
causal agent of black rot, which affects crucifers such as _Brassica_
and _Arabidopsis_. It is an important seed-borne pathogen and can
also be spread by mechanical means. Symptoms include marginal leaf
chlorosis and darkening of vascular tissue, accompanied by extensive
wilting and necrosis. Full leaf yellowing, wilting, and necrosis
occur as the disease advances. Pre-existing fungal lesions may
increase the susceptibility of crops to black rot by providing
entrance points for the bacteria.
_Leptosphaeria maculans_ (previously _Phoma lingam_) causes black
leg, also called _Phoma_ stem canker, on oilseed rape (_Brassica
napus_). Black leg is the most serious disease of oilseed rape in
most of the world's production areas. The fungus can also affect
other _Brassica_ species but rarely does very serious damage in
these. It is spread by infected seed and crop litter.
The fungus _Alternaria brassicicola_ causes black spot disease (also
called dark leaf spot) on virtually every important cultivated
_Brassica_ species including broccoli, cabbage, canola, and mustard.
It is of worldwide economic importance resulting in up to 50 percent
yield reductions in affected crops. Symptoms are necrotic lesions on
leaves. However, the fungus can also infect all other parts of the
plant including pods, seeds, and stems, and is of particular
importance as a post-harvest disease. The related species _Alternaria
brassicae_ causes dark leaf spots and dark stem lesions immediately
after germination and can result in "damping-off," or stunted
seedlings. The fungus causes major disease in oilseed rape and often
spreads to and causes damage in other brassicas.
Light leaf spot in _Brassica_ spp. is caused by the fungus
_Pyrenopeziza brassicae_ (previously _Cylindrosporium concentricum_).
It is a major disease of oilseed rape but rarely very damaging on
other brassicas. Leaves become infected soon after sowing, but remain
symptomless until the appearance of pale green or water soaked
lesions (which are brittle and crack easily when bent) on older
leaves. These symptoms develop into large (1 cm diameter) spots, fawn
in colour with a crusty appearance.
Ringspot disease on _Brassica_ crops is caused by the fungus
_Mycosphaerella brassicicola_. Symptoms are small dark spots on
leaves, which become larger lesions with concentric rings of growth
and a definite margin. In the UK, it has become more damaging in
recent years especially in Cornwall and Lincolnshire.
Brassica powdery mildew is caused by the fungus _Erysiphe
cruciferarum_. It is widespread with possibly severe attacks on
brassica crops. Powdery mildews are a group of closely related
species of fungi with a narrow host range. Low levels of fungal
infection may show no symptoms but these may develop when conditions
are favourable. Spores are spread by wind.
White blister, or white rust, is a disease caused by _Albugo
candida_. This fungus is quite common on species in the
_Brassicaceae_ and affects most crucifers causing conspicuous leaf
patches. It is rarely a problem on oilseed rape but has become
increasingly damaging on other brassicas.
