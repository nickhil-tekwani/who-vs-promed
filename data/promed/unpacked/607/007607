Health authorities in Neuquen confirmed that the death of a 32-year-old man in San Martin de los Andes city on [15 Mar 2018] was due to [a] hantavirus [infection], according to information provided in recent hours by the Malbran Institute, after having received test results.

The head of Health Zone IV of Neuquen province, Nestor Saez, explained to the Telam agency that "the man had some previous health visits before hospitalization in which the impression was one of influenza or of tonsillitis, and even asked for mouth exudate sample thinking that it could be the throat."

The physician stated that in days following the medical consultations, the patient returned to the emergency service of the Ramon Carrillo Hospital in bad condition and began to worsen with respiratory and cardiovascular problems, was intubated with mechanical respiration, and around 5 hours later he died."

"The problem with this disease is that we do not have specific treatment, and moreover it has a rapid clinical progression and high fatality rate, 40 or 50 percent, that people can not overcome," according to SÃ¡ez.

In addition, he said that the patient, "was a rural worker and camped in forested areas, and was working in El Bolson in the Lake Lolog area, as well as in various places of the mountains where he had various rural tasks such as weed and brush clearing and collecting firewood," and stated that, "we always recommend carrying out these tasks with masks, gloves and high boots to prevent" [infection].

Meanwhile, the government of Neuquen province issued a statement manifesting the necessary precautions to prevent the spread of the disease: avoid contact with rodents and their excreta, as well as maintain hygienic environmental practices that prevent them from colonizing housing, recreation, and work sites.

[This case illustrates the speed with which hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome can develop, in this unfortunate case with a fatal outcome. As with the report above, the reports of hantavirus infections that ProMED receives very seldom mention which hantavirus is the etiologic agent of the cases. Cases of hantavirus infection have been reported from various parts of Argentina over recent years. As noted in ProMED-mail archive no. 20110430.1348, several endemic hantaviruses have been associated with human infection in Argentina: Andes virus (western Argentina; in the long-tailed pygmy rice rat host, _Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_); related Andes-like viruses Hu39694 (in central Argentina; rodent host unknown); Lechiguana (in central Argentina in the yellow pygmy rice rat _O. flavescens_); Oran (in northwestern Argentina; in _O. longicaudatus_); and Bermejo (western Argentina; in _O. flavescens_). Without laboratory confirmation, it is not possible to say with certainty which hantavirus was involved in this case. However, since the report indicates that the man had been working in the mountains, Andes virus seems likely.

Although rodents were mentioned as possible hosts in the report above, the rodent host of the suspected hantavirus endemic in this area was not reported but likely is the long-tailed pygmy rice rat host, _O. longicaudatus_.
