[Although the Republic of Dagestan is not directly adjacent to Kazakhstan, this outbreak could be related to the ongoing sheep and goat pox events that are occurring in that area. During 2015 Kazakhstan reported 2 outbreaks of the disease (see report below).

The causative agents of sheep pox and goat pox are members of the _Capripox_ genus in the family _Poxviridae_. Most isolates cause disease exclusively/mainly in sheep or exclusively/mainly in goats; some isolates can cause serious disease in both species. The causative viruses cannot be distinguished from each other with current techniques. Sheep and goat pox viruses cause disease only in these 2 species. The disease does not affect humans.

In the current case in Dagestan, the report says the affected species is defined as sheep/gloats. This may be interpreted in different ways:
1. The flocks are mixed of both species, both affected
2. The flocks are mixed of both species, but only one of the 2 is affected.

In most Middle Eastern countries, the 2nd scenario is prevailing, and most outbreaks involve sheep.

It will be helpful to obtain the precise picture currently seen in Dagestan.
