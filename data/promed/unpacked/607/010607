[After 2 weeks of steady reporting of newly confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection on a daily basis, there were no newly confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection from 31 Oct 2014 through 2 Nov 2014, followed by 2 new confirmations each day on 3 and 4 Nov 2014. The one new death reported during this period (31 Oct - 4 Nov 2014) was a 60 year old Saudi male from Hafr al Batin who had a history of contact with animals prior to onset of illness and had been reported as newly confirmed on 29 Oct 2014. Noteworthy is that all 4 of the newly confirmed cases were reported from Riyadh, and 3 of the 4 are under investigation for possible contact with suspected or known cases in both the healthcare environment as well as in the community.

According to the latest information from the MOH, the tally of laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV in Saudi Arabia since June 2012 is now 793 cases and 338 deaths (case fatality rate 42.6 percent).

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) - Saudi Arabia 3 Nov 2014
--------------------------
Between [18 and 26 Oct 2014], the National IHR Focal Point of Saudi Arabia (KSA) notified WHO of 12 additional cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection, including 5 deaths.

Details of the cases are as follows:
The cases are from Taif (6), Riyadh (4), Madinah (1) and Skaka (1). The median age of the patients is 54 years old (ranging from 17 to 75 years old). Nine cases (75 percent) are men and 10 (83 percent) are Saudi nationals. Ten patients (83 percent) suffer from one or more comorbidities. None of the cases has a history of contact with camels nor of raw camel products consumption; however, 2 of the patients (17 percent) live in areas densely populated with camels. In the 14 days that preceded the onset of symptoms, none of the cases performed Umrah/Hajj, and only 2 (17 percent) travelled out of their cities of residence. Eight patients (67 percent) came in contact with laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases.

Tracing of household contacts and healthcare contacts is ongoing for these cases.

The National IHR Focal Point of Saudi Arabia also notified WHO of the death of a MERS-CoV case that was initially reported on [6 Oct 2014].

Globally, WHO has been notified of 897 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including at least 325 related deaths.

[Additional information provided in this update includes the updated global tally of laboratory confirmed cases reported to WHO as of 3 Nov 2014; 897 cases of MERS-CoV infection have been reported to WHO, including at least 325 deaths (case fatality rate 36.2 percent). Prior to 23 Oct 2014, information on possible contacts with suspected or known cases was not readily available on the MOH website, so the additional information that 8 of the 12 cases reported during the period of 18-26 Oct 2014 had a history of contact with suspected or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection helps to further clarify the existence of a nosocomial related outbreak of MERS-CoV during this period.

Of note, the case in Skaka reported in the WHO report had been reported as coming from Al Jawf province with date of onset on 30 Oct 2014 (Skaka is the capital of Al Jawf province).

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) - Qatar 31 Oct 2014
-------------------------------
On [12 and 23 Oct 2014], WHO was notified by the National IHR Focal Point of Qatar of 2 cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). These are the 1st cases reported to WHO by Qatar in 2014.

Details of the cases are as follows:
- A 71-year-old male from Doha, Qatar developed symptoms on [1 Oct 2014] while traveling with 3 family members by car from Qatar to the Al-Hasa Region of Saudi Arabia. On [7 Oct 2014], as his symptoms worsened, the case visited a private health facility in Al-Hasa, whereupon he was transferred to the Hamad General Hospital in Doha. On [11 Oct 2014], laboratory tests conducted on the patient confirmed MERS-CoV infection. The case owns a camel barn and is known to have consumed raw camel milk. The patient has comorbidities and is currently in critical condition.

- A 43-year-old male from Doha developed symptoms on [14 Oct 2014]. On [17 and 18 Oct 2014], he sought care at a health care facility but was not admitted. On [20 Oct 2014], his condition deteriorated; he was admitted to hospital, and was confirmed positive for MERS-CoV infection on the same day. The patient presented with no comorbidities, but he had frequently visited a camel barn in the 14 days that preceded the onset of symptoms. There is no history of exposure to other known risk factors. Currently, the patient is in stable condition.

Public health response
Household and healthcare contacts of the 2 cases have been identified and are being followed up. Currently, none of these contacts are symptomatic. Health education messages about appropriate preventive measures have been shared with the household contacts of the 2 patients. Infection prevention and control measures in all health facilities have been reinforced by Qatar's Supreme Council of Health (SCH). Furthermore, the SCH, in collaboration with the Ministry of Environment, is investigating the camels in the 2 barns.

Globally, WHO has received notification of 885 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including at least 319 related deaths.

[Both of these cases have been reported previously on ProMED-mail (MERS-CoV (42): Saudi Arabia, Qatar 20141024.2894667, MERS-CoV (34): Qatar, Saudi Arabia, new case, RFI 20141012.2856064), but information such as contact with camels and drinking camel milk was not available at the time of the original reports. We await further information on results of studies on possible MERS-CoV infection of the camels on the farms these cases had contact with.

[4] Saudi Arabia, updated control procedures, MOH 4 Nov 2014

A review of recent MERS-CoV cases by the Ministry of Health's Command & Control Center (CCC) identified the need to update its clinical operations protocols for handling patients who are suspected to have or have the disease. The document has been posted on the CCC website: http://www.moh.gov.sa/ccc.

"It is critical that all healthcare workers and facilities, public and private, follow these updated protocols," said Dr. Anees Sindi, Deputy Commander of the CCC. "With more than 70 percent of recent MERS-CoV cases resulting from secondary infections, mainly acquired in the hospital, we have recognized the need to implement stricter infection-control measures across the health system. Sporadic cases of the disease, which are thought to be caused by unprotected contact with camels, are likely to happen," added Dr. Anees. "Secondary infections, however, should be preventable. One goal of the CCC is to reduce the potential for MERS-CoV to spread, thus protecting the health of patients and healthcare workers. These updated protocols are designed to do just that."

The guiding principles of the protocols include:
- All hospital staff must be familiar with the latest MERS-CoV case definition.
- Suspect patients are to be handled with appropriate protection equipment, following all recommended IPC guidelines.
- Patient transfer protocols must be followed.
- Hospital staff are to call the (937) infectious disease hotline to report the case and receive up-to-date guidance.

Also, as part of the CCC's comprehensive preparedness program, the Ministry reiterated that it has created 17 MERS-CoV specialist hospitals across the Kingdom and has named 3 centers of excellence for handling complex or difficult cases:
- Western Province - King Fahad Hospital, Jeddah
- Central Province - Prince Mohammad bin Abdulaziz Hospital, Riyadh
- Eastern Province - Dammam Medical Complex

The full set of updated protocols has been distributed to healthcare workers across the regions, who are expected to be familiar and comply with them effective immediately.

The move comes as part of the Ministry's commitment to building a comprehensive preparedness program based on international best practices and knowledge-based solutions to best serve and protect the people of the Kingdom.

For more information about ways to prevent MERS-CoV, contact the (937) infectious disease hotline or visit the Ministry's website: http://www.moh.gov.sa/ccc.

[The interesting new information in this brief report is the "more than 70 percent of recent MERS-CoV cases resulting from secondary infections, mainly acquired in the hospital." This confirms that nosocomial transmission has been a major driving force in the MERS-CoV situation in Saudi Arabia. - Mod.MPP
