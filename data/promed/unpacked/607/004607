Yemen's cholera outbreak has infected 612 703 people and killed 2048 since it began in April 2017, and some districts are still reporting sharp rises in new cases, data from the WHO and Yemen's health ministry showed on Tue 5 Sep 2017. The overall spread of the epidemic has slowed in the past 2 months, with the daily number of new suspected cases cut to around 3000 in recent days. However the epidemic, the most explosive on record in terms of its rapid spread, has continually confounded expectations. Soon after it began, WHO saw a worst-case scenario of 300 000 cases within 6 months.

But by the end of June 2017, WHO was hoping 218 000 cases might be the halfway mark. In late July 2017, it said the spread had peaked after infecting 400 000. Epidemics normally decline as quickly as they arise, so the peak of the disease -- which is spread by contaminated food and water -- should be roughly half the eventual total caseload. But the decline in the epidemic has been bumpy, and the number of new cases rose in 2 of the past 4 weeks.

WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic said some of the most affected areas, such as Sana'a City and the governorates of Hajjah and Amran, had seen falls in the numbers of new cases. But there had been a "sudden and significant increase" in the number of suspected cases reported from 12 districts, in the governorates of Hodeidah, Al Jawf, Al Mahwit, Ibb, Dhamar, Al Bayda, and Aden.

"WHO is currently investigating the reason for this increase. A key aim of the investigation will be to determine whether the numbers are accurate and whether the spike in suspected cases is, in fact, caused by cholera or another diarrheal disease like rotavirus," Jasarevic said.

Save the Children, a charity running cholera treatment centers, said last Fri 1 Sep 2017, that suspected cases in Hodeidah governorate had jumped by 40 percent in 3 weeks amid heavy rains and a heat wave, and in some districts weekly caseloads were double their previous peaks.

The UN has said the epidemic is man-made, driven by a civil war that has left 15.7 million people without clean water or sanitation.

[Although a number of sources have recently reported decreasing numbers of daily cases, the numbers seem to support the continuing robust number of daily cases. If the epidemic were to continue at the current rate of cases per day, by the end of 2017, there could be 700 000 more cases for a total of 1.12 million cases since the end of April 2017, with 3300 more deaths for a total of about 5500 deaths over that period. With the continue hostilities in Yemen and the onset of the rainy season, whatever is being reported as a decrease in cases will likely and perhaps dramatically be reversed. In August 2017, 171 296 cases were reported, that is 5710 new cases of cholera PER DAY. Whether some of the newly reported upswing of cases are due to other causes is unclear since the ability to formally diagnose these cases is quite limited by military operations throughout the country.

In the last complete year of data (2015); http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/250142/1/WER9138.pdf, WHO reported a total of 172 454 cases worldwide in 42 countries. This continuing, record-breaking cholera disaster in Yemen is only 17 weeks old and is 3.55 times the total number of cases of 2015 and 80 percent more than the peak year of the Haiti outbreak (2011) of 340 311 cases. - Mod.LL
