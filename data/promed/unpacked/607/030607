Anthrax has now been confirmed as the cause of the outbreak that has killed 52 animals. Parks Canada has confirmed anthrax in at least one of the more than 50 wood bison carcasses found recently scattered throughout Wood Buffalo National Park.

The latest carcass was found early last week on Parsons Lake Road in the park, bringing the dead count up to 52. It tested positive for anthrax and was burned last week.

Though not every carcass was able to be tested for anthrax, Parks officials say a positive test in one is enough to confirm an outbreak. "Once you get a positive test, we're not calling this suspected any more; we've got anthrax in Wood Buffalo," said Wood Buffalo National Park spokesperson Mike Keizer.

Three carcasses were sampled to test for the disease. Two, which were given the standard field test using mouth and anal swabs, tested negative. The last carcass found on Parsons Lake Road underwent a more intrusive sampling technique, where a piece of the nose is removed, and tested positive [i.e. they sampled the turbinates - Mod.MHJ].

Keizer said there are a number of factors that can contribute to a false negative result. The field swab tests are known to be unreliable due to factors like the age of the carcass. Furthermore, not all carcasses were able to be tested due to the condition of the body or their location in a remote area of the park.

The new sampling technique, which requires a saw to cut into the nose, will likely be used in the future whenever possible, Keizer said. "It's a much more pure sample," he said. "So we're going to modify, I think, the way we try to sample over the next few years if we get another outbreak."

Though there have been no new carcasses found since 19 Jul 2015, Parks Canada is not calling the outbreak over. Staff continue their flyovers and road patrols looking for other dead bison, particularly those in high-use areas accessible by the public. Those found in "front country" are burned, while the majority of the carcasses located in remote park areas are left to decompose naturally.

Visitors who come across a dead bison are warned not to touch it and to report it immediately to the Wood Buffalo National Park office.

Still, Keizer said the absence of new deaths is a "good sign" the outbreak might be finished. He said the wet, cooler weather might have had something to do with the downturn. Bison typically contract the anthrax bacteria, which live in the soil, while grazing or wallowing in the dirt on hot days. "Historically, if we get back to cooler weather like this, it seems the anthrax outbreaks slow down; but is that a definite? No, nobody can tell you a definite yes on that," Keizer said. "What we've seen is that it looks like a good sign."

Parks Canada announced a suspected anthrax outbreak on 9 Jul 2015 after an initial 34 bison carcasses were found scattered throughout 4 remote areas of the park. The deaths were immediately treated as if they were anthrax-caused. The current population of wood bison in Wood Buffalo National Park is estimated at 5000 and considered healthy, though its status is closely monitored. Anthrax outbreaks have been observed 13 times in the park since 1962. There have been no cases of visitors contracting the disease.

[There is an excellent map with this article, and subscribers are encouraged to look at it. One aspect of this that jumps out is that there were 5 separate sites affected, one significantly (Sweetgrass). As they fly surveillance flights regularly through the summer on a weekly basis, one can assume that these 5 outbreaks blew up more or less simultaneously; the Parsons Lake Road case is on the east side of the road going south from Fort Smith, just a small dot. As it is the breeding season, the affected mobs are each at their preferred meadows with little real movement of bison. On the other hand, these are long known anthrax patches in the park. If I were to guess at the different incidence rates, I would put it down to the time since the last known outbreaks. As there tends to be plenty of Tabanid fly activity in the park and well documented subclinical exposure, and immunity as a result, the susceptibility of the Sweetgrass mob was clearly a high possibly due to no outbreaks in the past 5 years or so, but high immunity in Salt Plains South area.

That Parks Canada is only burning those carcasses in the "front country," i.e. in sight of roads and leaving the rest, means that they have abandoned their aggressive long-time policy of burning all carcasses to limit future outbreaks. Presumably, the accountants tolled the cost. And if truth be told, burning individual carcasses is not cheap.

Limiting the field sampling is understandable, as the Scottish Foot Test -- turn the bird carcass over and state the result based on experience -- is easy, cheap, and on the whole effective under the circumstances. It is highly probable that all 52 animals died of anthrax. But something we have seen elsewhere in anthrax epidemics such as this is that not all animals will have died of the same strain. The factors which will have initiated cases in one area will also apply in others. And when you look, different strains reveal themselves, sometimes with minor differences, sometimes with large differences. _Bacillus anthracis_ spores are very robust. You only need a few initial positives to define the response, say 1-3. Swab and GPS the other 49 carcasses; let them dry out and sporulate; and then put them aside to be worked up at a later date when there is time to do the MLVA/SNP/SNR analyses. These data will tell you much about what happened as you watched. Thank you, Joe. - Mod.MHJ
