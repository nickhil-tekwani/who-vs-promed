----------------------------------------------------------------------
In response to your request for information in relation to the HAV outbreak, please be advised that we have published more epi information on the cluster at http://www.health.nsw.gov.au/Infectious/reports/Pages/CDWR-2017.aspx (week 35; week starting 2 Sep 2017)

Summary of the relevant information from this is as follows:
From 25 Jul 2017 to 2 Sep 2017, there have been 13 cases of hepatitis A reported in NSW [New South Wales]. On average, there are 3 cases reported in NSW per month, and most cases acquire their infection overseas. Only 3 of the 13 recent cases have any overseas exposure.

Molecular typing of the viruses isolated from recent cases has shown 10 of these cases share a common partial genome sequence suggesting a common source of infection in NSW for these cases. Half of the cases (5) are residents of South Eastern Sydney Local Health District (LHD), with the other cases residents of Northern Sydney LHD (2), Sydney LHD (1), Illawarra Shoalhaven LHD (1), and Hunter New England LHD (1). Both of the cases who live outside Sydney reported travel to the Sydney area during their incubation period. 9 of the 10 cases are male and 2 cases report being men who have sex with men (MSM). The median age of cases is 45.5 years (range 29 to 69 years).

The molecular typing of hepatitis A viruses in this cluster shows they are very similar to a strain currently circulating in Europe associated with a large, multi-country outbreak. Since June 2016, 1500 confirmed hepatitis A cases and 2660 probable or suspected cases have been reported in Europe, predominantly among MSM (see the ECDC report).

Since the cases share overlapping incubation periods and the timing of symptom onset is close together, it is suspected that the cases were exposed to a common source. Health Protection NSW and public health units in conjunction with the NSW Food Authority are jointly investigating possible sources of infection. Despite extensive investigation, to date no common food item or possible exposure has been found in common with all the cases.

The recent NSW cases are unrelated to the national outbreak of hepatitis A linked with frozen berry consumption. Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ) issued a consumer level food recall on 2 Jun 2017 for the Creative Gourmet brand of Mixed Frozen Berries 300 g with a best before date of 15 Jan 2021. Consumers are advised to return any opened or unopened product to the place of purchase for a full refund or dispose of them. None of the locally acquired cases of hepatitis A in NSW match the genetic type of this outbreak, and few have reported eating any brand of frozen berries prior to their illness.

Please note: we did not mention lettuce in our initial media release (http://www.health.nsw.gov.au/news/Pages/20170905_02.aspx), that was the Daily Telegraph.

The hepatitis A outbreak in Sydney has worsened with another 5 people diagnosed with the infection. NSW Health is investigating the cause of the outbreak which now stands at a total of 17 people diagnosed with the disease.

Hepatitis A is usually only picked up by Australians while they're travelling overseas, with locally acquired cases considered highly unusual. None of these latest people to be diagnosed left Australia in the weeks before they fell ill. NSW Health is working with NSW Food Authority to investigate the outbreak to try to identify the food the people ate in the 50 days before they fell ill in a bid to find a common source of the infections. The incubation period is [up to - Mod.LL] 6 weeks.

Dr Vicky Sheppeard, Director Communicable Diseases with NSW Health said more people are expected to fall ill in the outbreak, with 3 people so sick they had to be hospitalized. "If people think they might have the symptoms they should go to the GP [general practitioner] and they should be very careful with hand washing and not prepare food for other people," she said.

Travelers to high-risk countries and anyone at higher risk of infection, including gay men, injecting drug users, sewerage workers, and childcare workers, should ensure that they are vaccinated against hepatitis A. People at high risk of infection including travellers and childcare workers are advised to get the hepatitis A vaccine. 2 doses of vaccine prevent infection and is available through GPs.

[ProMED thanks Keira Glasgow for this additional information. With the molecular typing of the virus in this NSW cluster being similar to that in the large European cluster in MSM, it is possible that the strain was introduced related to the summertime gay pride event in Spain. Whether local transmission was related in MSM or other high risk factors is, as yet, unclear in a majority of the cases. - Mod.LL
