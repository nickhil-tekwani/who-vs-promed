Dr. Crawford will be presenting a poster on outbreaks of the newly
recognized canine influenza virus at next week's ACVIM meeting in
Baltimore. Here is the abstract:
Influenza Virus Infection in Racing Greyhounds

Recurrent outbreaks of severe respiratory disease characterized by
coughing and fever have occurred in greyhounds at racing kennels in
the U.S. in recent years. In January 2004, a typical outbreak
occurred in 22 racing greyhounds in Jacksonville, Florida. Most of
these dogs had fevers and cough, but 8 died from hemorrhagic
pneumonia. In June 2004, a similar outbreak occurred in thousands of
greyhounds at race tracks in 6 states. There are no reports
documenting the cause of these acute respiratory disease outbreaks in
racing greyhounds. The objective of this work was to identify the
etiological agent(s) involved in the January and June 2004 outbreaks.
Paired acute and convalescent nasal swabs and serum samples were
collected from dogs with clinical signs and from asymptomatic dogs
housed in contact with sick dogs. Bacterial cultures were performed
with the nasal swabs. Virus neutralization and hemagglutination
assays were performed on serum. Postmortem examinations were
conducted on dogs that died during the outbreaks. Bacterial cultures,
virus isolation studies, and immunohistochemistry assays for viral
antigens were performed with respiratory tract tissues.
None of the common canine respiratory pathogens, including
_Bordetella bronchiseptica_, distemper virus, adenovirus type 2, and
parainfluenza virus, were identified as the etiological agent(s).
Pathologic findings included: 1) severe pulmonary and pleural
hemorrhage; 2) acute to subacute erosive to hyperplastic tracheitis,
bronchitis, and bronchiolitis; and 3) bronchopneumonia. The
epithelial lining and airway lumens in these tissues were infiltrated
by neutrophils and macrophages.
Influenza A subtype H3N8 virus was isolated from the lungs of a Florida dog
that died in January and a Texas dog that died in June. Influenza H3N8 virus
was recovered from archived lung tissue from a Florida greyhound that died
during a respiratory disease outbreak in 2003. Genetic sequence analyses and
phylogenetic comparisons determined that all 3 canine isolates were closely
related and have evolved from contemporary strains of equine influenza H3N8.
Immunohistochemistry demonstrated influenza antigen in bronchial gland
epithelial cells, bronchial and bronchiolar epithelial cells, and in
alveolar macrophages. Seroconversion to the canine influenza virus was
demonstrated by hemagglutination inhibition and microneutralization assays.
Based on virus isolation from lungs, viral antigens in lung tissues, and
seroconversion data, we conclude that the novel canine influenza virus was
the etiological agent responsible for the January and June 2004 respiratory
disease outbreaks in racing greyhounds. This represents the 1st report of
influenza virus associated with respiratory disease in dogs.
