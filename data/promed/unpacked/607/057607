Citation: Mehew J, Johnson R, Roberts D, Harvala H. Convalescent plasma for COVID-19: male gender, older age and hospitalisation associated with high neutralising antibody levels, England, 22 April to 12 May 2020. Euro Surveill. 2020; 25(45): pii=2001754. https://doi.org/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.45.2001754

Abstract: We analysed factors associated with neutralising antibody levels in 330 convalescent plasma donors. Women and younger donors were more likely not to have measurable neutralising antibodies, while higher antibody levels were observed in men, in older donors and in those who had been hospitalised. These data will be of value in the timely recruitment of convalescent plasma donors most likely to have high levels of neutralising antibodies for ongoing studies investigating its effectiveness.

Introduction: At the time of a 2nd wave of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (1), effective antiviral therapies and vaccines are not yet available for clinical use (2,3). Convalescent plasma collected from recovered COVID-19 patients has been suggested a safe and probably effective treatment in some non-randomised studies (4-11). As the efficacy of such therapy is most probably associated with the presence of high levels of neutralising antibody in the donated plasma, we investigated the clinical and demographic factors that are predictive of high titres in convalescent plasma donors. This may provide an effective and rapid way to support convalescent plasma collections for ongoing randomised clinical trials.

Conclusions: Until effective antiviral treatments and vaccines against the COVID-19 pandemic become available, convalescent plasma therapy is an existing option that can be used against this infection. It is important that the convalescent plasma contains high titres of neutralising antibody, as the use of low-titre plasma can prevent or prolong evaluation of its efficacy in clinical trials. Older male donors with a previous SARS-CoV-2 infection leading to hospitalisation were in our study the most likely to have high neutralising antibody titres. This knowledge can support fast and practical recruitment strategies so that limited testing resources can be targeted to those most likely to harbour therapeutic levels of neutralising antibodies. It can also inform selection of places and time periods when resources for antibody testing are limited.

[See source URL above for full report and references. Also read the National Institutes of Health COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines regarding convalescent plasma (last updated 9 Oct 2020) at https://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/immune-based-therapy/blood-derived-products/convalescent-plasma/. Portions of the guidelines are excerpted below (see full report for references):

On 23 Aug 2020, the FDA authorized the use of convalescent plasma for the treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Both high titer (i.e., Ortho VITROS SARS-CoV-2 IgG tested with signal-to-cutoff ratio of 12 or greater) and low titer COVID-19 convalescent plasma are authorized for use.

Convalescent plasma: Plasma from donors who have recovered from COVID-19 may contain antibodies to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that may help suppress the virus and modify the inflammatory response (1).

Recommendation: There are insufficient data for the COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel (the Panel) to recommend either for or against the use of COVID-19 convalescent plasma for the treatment of COVID-19.

Rationale for recommendation: Currently, there are insufficient data from well-controlled, adequately powered, randomized clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of convalescent plasma for the treatment of COVID-19. However, more than 70 000 patients in the USA have received COVID-19 convalescent plasma through the Mayo Clinic's Expanded Access Program (EAP), which was designed primarily to provide broad access to investigational convalescent plasma and thus did not include an untreated control arm. Both the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Mayo Clinic performed retrospective, indirect evaluations of efficacy by using the Mayo Clinic EAP data, hypothesizing that patients who received plasma units with higher titers of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies would have better clinical outcomes than those who received plasma units with lower antibody titers. The results of their analyses suggest that convalescent plasma with high antibody titers may be more beneficial than low-titer plasma in nonintubated patients, particularly when administered within 72 hours of COVID-19 diagnosis.

The FDA determined that these findings -- along with additional data from small randomized and nonrandomized studies, observational cohorts, and animal experiments -- met the criteria for Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) issuance (2,3). Despite meeting the "may be effective" criterion for EUA issuance, the EAP analyses are not sufficient to establish the efficacy or safety of convalescent plasma due to the lack of a randomized, untreated control group and potential confounding. There is no widely available and generally agreed-upon best test for measuring neutralizing antibodies, and the antibody titers of plasma from patients who have recovered from COVID-19 are highly variable. Furthermore, hospitalized patients with COVID-19 may already have SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody titers that are comparable with those of plasma donors, potentially limiting the benefit of convalescent plasma in this patient population (4,5). Several randomized, placebo-controlled trials of COVID-19 convalescent plasma are ongoing.

The Panel's assessment of the EAP data is consistent with the FDA statements in the convalescent plasma EUA documents (3,6,7).

However, also see the following from the British Medical Journal (Convalescent plasma is ineffective for COVID-19: Lessons from the Placid Trial. BMJ 2020; 371: m4072 https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.m4072):

"...the PLACID Trial investigators found no net benefit associated with convalescent plasma in patients admitted to hospital with moderate COVID-19. The composite primary outcome (progression to severe disease or all-cause mortality at 28 days) occurred in 19% (44 of 235) of patients in the intervention arm and 18% (41 of 229) of patients in the control arm (risk ratio, 1.04; 95% confidence interval, 0.71-1.54). Restricting the comparison to the subset of patients who received plasma with detectable antibody titers did not change the outcome."

A total of 61 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 33 of the 61 countries reporting more than 1000 newly confirmed cases are from the European region, 11 are from the Americas region, 7 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 5 are from the South East Asia region, 3 are from the Western Pacific region, and 2 are from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have increased by 8.7%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 10.5%. Looking at the same comparisons in the USA (which reported 29.2% of all newly reported cases in the past 24 hours), as the dominant country worldwide with clearly uncontrolled transmission, the 7-day change in daily reported cases is 35.5% and in reported deaths is 9.5%. In Italy, the dominant country in the European region, the 7-day change in daily reported cases is 13.8% and in reported deaths is 51.1%. And in Iran, the dominant country in the Eastern Mediterranean region, the 7-day change in daily reported cases is 26.6% and in reported deaths is 7.6%. (Apologies, in yesterday's update (488), the 7-day averages for Iran cases and deaths were erroneously reversed. It should have read the 7-day change in daily reported cases is 23.5% and in reported deaths is 8.4%. - Mod.MPP)

Impression: The global daily reported cases continue to increase with the daily increase now approaching 700 000 new cases. This will change over the next few days as the weekend reporting artifacts set in with reduced or no reporting of cases in countries with known high levels of transmission. Countries in the European and the Americas regions are still showing the largest increases in daily new case counts, followed by the Eastern Mediterranean and the South East Asia regions. The growth in the USA is exponential with almost 200 000 cases reported in the past 24 hours and the total number of reported deaths 25 deaths shy of a quarter of a million. - Mod.MPP]
