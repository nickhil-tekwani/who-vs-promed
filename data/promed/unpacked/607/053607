An outbreak of diarrheal disease has claimed more than 40 lives and sent
hundreds to hospital, medical authorities in the Sierra Leonean capital of
Freetown have confirmed. The disease is being tested in laboratories to
rule out the chance that the disease is cholera. Health authorities are
sure that it is linked to poverty and over-population in the war-torn
capital city. "Most of the patients who complain of diarrhea are old
people and children who come from depressed and densely-populated parts of
the capital," said Dr. Fadlu Deen of the main Freetown Connaught Hospital.
A nurse said today that all 120 patients received at the hospital over the
past two weeks, show clear symptoms of cholera. "They pass frequent stools,
have acute vomiting and are increasingly dehydrated," she said.
"Human Development Report" by the 1998 U.N. Development Program shows
Sierra Leone at the bottom of the list of the poorest countries in the
world. "Today, almost 10 percent of all the health institutions in the
country have been destroyed or rendered non-functional, as a result of
war-related activities," said UNDP's resident representative in Freetown,
Elizabeth Luanga.
She said almost 70 percent of Sierra Leone's 4.8 million population has no
access to safe sanitation. "This has given rise to increased incidence of
diarrhoea and cholera," said Luanga. Sierra Leone's life expectancy now
stands at 39 years.
Even as the authorities battle to contain the spread of the epidemic in
Freetown, a new outbreak has been reported in Makeni, the capital of the
northern region. More than 100 cases, including 10 deaths, were reported
this week, according to Sierra Leone's independent newspaper, the Observer.
With medical facilities few and far between, the mortality rate is soaring
by the day. Health authorities in the town have advised residents to resort
to a salt-sugar-solution (SSS) intake as a quick remedy. In Masingbi
town, where a refugee camp holds over 20,000, the death rate among children
and the old, as a result of the epidemic, is 15 a day, according to
newspaper reports.
