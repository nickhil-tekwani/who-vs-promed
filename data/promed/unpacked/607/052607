News of the response
Minister of health visits Beni and Butembo
-------------------
-The Minister of health, Dr. Oly Ilunga Kalenga, made a field trip to Beni Thu 6 Sep 2018. Accompanied by the director of the National Institute of Biomedical Research (INRB), professor Jean-Jacques Muyembe, and Dr Njdoloko Tambwe Bathe, the coordinator of the response, participated in Radio Okapi's "Parole aux Auditeurs" interactive show in the Ndindi neighborhood, where they answered questions from the public about Ebola. The delegation then flew to Butembo, where they held a working session with the teams on the spot. They also brought the equipment to install the mobile laboratory in Butembo to speed up the analysis of the samples taken.

Vaccination
----------
- Since the beginning of the vaccination on 8 Aug 2018, 6486 people have been vaccinated, including 3279 in Mabalako, 1930 in Beni, 1067 in Mandima, 121 in Oicha, 70 in Katwa (Butembo), and 19 in Kinshasa.

[One can see the continuing steady but slow increase in cases. It would be informative to know what questions the public had during Radio Okapi's "Parole aux Auditeurs" interactive show to get a better idea of their concerns. Holding this forum for the public to address their concerns is an excellent approach to getting them involved in the response. The installation of a mobile laboratory in Butembo to speed up the analysis of the samples taken is also an excellent proactive approach. - Mod LK]

The epidemiological situation of the Ebola virus disease dated 4 Sep 2018:
- A total of 127 cases of haemorrhagic fever were reported in the region, of which 96 were confirmed and 31 were probable.
- 4 suspected cases are under investigation.
- 3 new confirmed cases, including 1 in Mabalako, 1 in Mandima, and 1 in Butembo.
- Investigations revealed that a confirmed case in Beni came from Kalunguta, a rural health area between Beni and Butembo. The patient is already cured and has been discharged from the Ebola Treatment Center (ETC).
- 2 deaths of confirmed cases, including 1 in Beni and 1 in Butembo.

News of the response
Coordination in Butembo
--------------
- On Tue 4 Sep 2018, a sample taken from a person who died in Butembo was positive for Ebola. This is the 1st confirmed case of Ebola in Butembo. This is a contact from Beni who refused to cooperate with the health authorities and fled to Butembo after falling ill.

- He died at Butembo University Hospital. The hospital's health staff, having already been trained on how to deal with suspected cases, complied with individual protection measures. The burial has been secured.

- For several days, a coordination monitoring team had already settled in Butembo after receiving information that several contacts living in Beni had moved to Butembo.

- On Wed 5 Sep 2018, response coordinator Dr Ndjoloko Tambwe Bathe traveled to Butembo with other coordinators to set up a full response team. They also identified the location sites of the mobile laboratory and a new CTE (the 5th to date). Vaccination of identified 1st contacts was also able to begin.

Port of entry monitoring
------------
- The National Border Health Program (PNHF) has established a mapping of population mobility in the areas affected by the epidemic in collaboration with the World Organization for Migration (IOM). This mapping has identified 5 priority areas for strengthening surveillance at ports of entry. These 5 priorities are as follows:
- Mangina - Kyanzaba - Mabalako
- Mangina - Beni
- Beni - Maboya - Butembo
- Beni - Bunia / Beni - Kisangani
- Beni - Kasindi

Vaccination
----------
Since vaccination began on 8 Aug 2018, 6343 people have been vaccinated, including 3210 in Mabalako, 1856 in Beni, 1067 in Mandima, 121 in Oicha, 70 in Katwa (Butembo), and 19 in Kinshasa.

[See more information on the death in Butembo in the post below, an unfortunate indication that the outbreak continues to spread. But the vaccine and therapeutics appear to be working well, so it is hoped they will be equally effective in stopping further expansion of the disease in Butembo. The difficulty of access to the contacts creates concern.

A question is whether the fatal case was a man or woman. Here the pronoun "he" is used, but in the reports below, it is stated the fatal case is a woman.

It should be noted that there had been 2 earlier cases listed as probable, reported in Butembo, prior to the current cases now being reported. Those earlier cases appear to have been fatal but did not spread to others. - Mod.LK]

Situation report
----------
The date [Sat 1 Sep 2018] marks one month since the declaration of the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in North Kivu and Ituri provinces, Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). The Ministry of Health, WHO, and partners have made progress in response to the outbreak during this time. Recent trends (Figure 1) suggest that control measures are working; however, these trends must be interpreted with caution.

Since our last situation report on Tue 28 Aug 2018 (external situation report no. 4), an additional 11 new EVD cases (8 confirmed and 3 probable) and 7 new deaths have been reported. Nine other suspected cases are currently under investigation to confirm or exclude EVD. [See updated case numbers in MoH report above.]

[2] Butembo ex Beni fatal case and new cases
- Wed 5 Sep 2018. DR Congo records 1st Ebola death in major eastern trade hub. Butembo ex Beni fatal case.
Source: Reuters Report [edited]
https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-ebola-congo/congo-records-first-ebola-death-in-major-eastern-trade-hub-idUSKCN1LL1FG

Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) has recorded its 1st death from Ebola in the eastern trading hub of Butembo, a city of almost a million with links to Uganda that could complicate efforts to control the outbreak, health officials said on [Wed 5 Sep 2018].

The epidemic is believed to have killed 85 people since July and infected another 39. Most have been in villages, but about 20 cases have been in Beni, a city of several hundred thousand people with close links to Uganda.

Butembo, about 55 km [34 miles] away, is 2 or 3 times the size of Beni. It straddles a major trading route for consumer goods entering Congo from East Africa and for Congolese exports of artisanal gold, coltan, timber, and other materials to East African ports via Uganda.

"Ebola case from Beni has died in Butembo DRC," Peter Salama, the World Health Organization's head of emergency operations, wrote on Twitter. "Good news is case detected quickly, response already in place and expanding. Bad new(s) is increases risk of further spread and having Ebola in an urban center makes ending the outbreak much harder," he said.

Butembo's mayor, Sylvain Kanyamanda, said the victim was a woman who was likely infected as a result of participating in an unsafe burial. She died in a university clinic. "We call on the population to exercise caution and to respect all hygiene measures recommended by health workers," he said.

Health officials say they have made progress slowing the virus's spread with experimental vaccines and treatments. But they cannot be sure the situation is under control due to difficulties accessing some areas.

Two South African peacekeepers were wounded in a rebel ambush near the epicenter of an Ebola outbreak in eastern DRC, their UN mission said on [Tue 4 Sep 2018].

[There is great concern over this death, as it indicates spread of Ebola virus from Beni to Butembo, about 55 km (34 miles) away and a major urban center, as pointed out in a tweet by Peter Salama, the World Health Organization's head of emergency operations. The likelihood that the woman who died was infected during an unsafe funeral again highlights how critical it is to educate the populace on safe funeral practices, especially during Ebola outbreaks.

The healthcare workers (HCWs) in the facility where the patient died will need to be monitored carefully and kept separate from patients, if these HCWs were not vaccinated. Similarly, patients and others who may have had contact with the infected woman also must be monitored and vaccinated. This is complicated by the danger of working in the areas of the country where, because of the violence, contacts are difficult to reach.

In a Huff Post report (https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/world-health-organization-ebola-congo-warning_us_5b9022cfe4b0162f47296009), Salama was reported to have said that "this outbreak is a prototype of the rising number of outbreaks of the future: one that spreads to more populated areas. As HuffPost has previously reported, outbreaks of the worst kinds of pathogens -- ones with the highest mortality rates and limited countermeasures -- are on the uptick due to population increases, more global travel, and changing migratory and environmental patterns that result in encroachment upon animal and other populations. And with more people living close together, outbreaks like this one will become even more common, Salama said, calling it a 'highly different paradigm.'"

"No longer will the standard be isolated rural communities that are the focus of these outbreaks, but actually dense areas of the world with high populations," he said.

In order to be prepared for ever increasing outbreaks, public-health infrastructure must be strong and maintained to be able to respond quickly. - Mod.LK]

- 6 Sep 2018. Ebola: 2 new confirmed Ebola cases in Butembo
Journal de Kinshasa [machine trans., edited]
https://www.journaldekinshasa.com/ebola-deux-nouveaux-cas-ebola-confirmes-a-butembo/

Two people died of Ebola haemorrhagic fever in the town of Butembo, opening another outbreak of infection in eastern DRC. A total of 195 people were identified as having been in contact with these 2 patients and must now urgently be vaccinated, but in the area, the fight against the epidemic is complicated because of the numerous population displacements and security problems. The 1st Ebola victim in Butembo town was known to the Congolese health services. This is a woman identified as carrying the disease in Beni, but who refused to be vaccinated and went to Butembo, thus opening another focus of contamination. As proof, the nurse who treated her is the 2nd confirmed Ebola case in Butembo; she died too. 195 people were identified by the health services as having been in contact with these 2 people. People must be vaccinated urgently according to Dr. Ndjoloklo Tambwe Bathe, sent by the Ministry to organize the response.

Another emergency for the doctor is to ensure the safety of these teams in the area. "In keeping with the international health regulations, we cannot prevent people from moving around. This is a 1st factor. The 2nd is the security issue. Our teams do not move as we want. Here, security supplants the whole response. Today, for example, my teams did not go to Butembo because safety was not guaranteed on the road."

Located 55 km [34 mi] from Beni, Butembo is an agglomeration of nearly a million inhabitants. And it has important trade links with neighboring Uganda.

[This is exactly what was feared would happen with expansion of Ebola to this highly urban area, and especially an area where safety is not assured. With 195 people having had contact with the infected individuals, vaccination is urgently needed. Healthcare workers should all be vaccinated before cases are introduced into their clinics and hospitals in anticipation of cases. Public health should override accepted protocols of allowing contacts to move around freely, i.e., quarantine of infected individuals would prevent the disease from spreading further if it could be enacted. - Mod.LK]

[The elopement of a known contact, and the unsafe burial from which the infection apparently originated, are clear-cut examples of community resistance in Beni (as we covered in Ebola Update (82)). The exportation of the disease to Butembo with the reported death of an HCW is a clear-cut consequence of such behavior, resulting in expansion of disease foci with fatal consequences to others. The situation is very analogous to the quarantine breaches early in the Equateur outbreak that we discussed in Ebola Update (15).

If the nurse in the Butembo university clinic did indeed die of EVD contracted from the escapee patient from Beni, this raises the question of whether that nurse had been vaccinated against Ebola or not. If so, this would apparently represent the 1st case of vaccine failure, at least in an HCW. If not, this then raises the question of whether all HCWs in North Kivu and surrounding areas should be vaccinated, if they have not already been, against such an eventuality.

In addition, this case of an absconded contact reveals the limitations of travel checkpoints on routes leading out from an outbreak area. The article above states that the "escapee" contact had refused vaccination, and even if she had been stopped at a thermometer checkpoint between Beni and Butembo, she may well have been asymptomatic. Such individuals, if they are determined to "go underground" and are sheltered by knowing or unknowing family and friends, can be very difficult indeed to trace. Let us hope that this tragic outcome can at least be used as an object lesson to overcome community resistance to Ebola control efforts. - Mod.LXL
