A family of 4 fell "horrifically" ill during a Spanish summer holiday which left 2 young daughters in hospital, one in critical condition.

The family, from Bishop Auckland in County Durham, travelled to a resort in Ibiza in June 2014 but say the trip turned into every family's worst nightmare when all of them fell ill, and the 2-year-old daughters were hospitalised for days as they battled _E. coli_ [O157].

One daughter spent 21 days in Royal Victoria Hospital in Newcastle and needed dialysis The toddlers have now been diagnosed with hemolytic uremic syndrome, a condition related to _E. coli_ [O157] which can cause kidney failure due to a breakdown of red blood cells.

The family arrived at the resort, in the Playa Las Cana area of Ibiza on 1 Jun 2014 for an 11-day break, but within days, all of them began suffering from symptoms of sickness, diarrhea and stomach cramps. The father and the daughters were all diagnosed as suffering with _E. coli_ O157 on their return, and the girls' symptoms were so severe that they were admitted to the Royal Victoria Hospital in Newcastle.

One daughter, who was 2 years old in July 2014, was discharged after 6 days, but the other, who turns 3 years old in August 2014, spent 21 days in hospital and needed dialysis to help her kidneys function properly.
