As of 1 PM (ET) Thu, 28 Sep 2006, 187 people infected with the outbreak
strain of _Escherichia coli_ O157:H7 have been reported to CDC from 26
states. Among those infected 97 (52 per cent) were hospitalized, 29 (16 per
cent) developed a type of kidney failure called hemolytic-uremic syndrome
(HUS), and an adult in Wisconsin died. 134 (72 per cent) were female and 18
(10 per cent) were children under 5 years old. The proportion of patients
who developed HUS was 29 per cent in children (under 18 years old), 7 per
cent in those 18 to 59 years old, and 14 per cent in those 60 years old or
older. Eighty-two per cent of atients who provided the date when their
illnesses began became ill between 19 Aug and 5 Sep 2006. The peak time
when illnesses began was 30 Aug to 1 Sep 2006 ï¿½ 32 per cent of patients
with the outbreak strain became ill on one of those 3 days.
2 deaths among suspect cases have been reported. Suspect cases are not
known to have been infected with the outbreak strain, so are not included
in the confirmed case count. Idaho is investigating a suspect case in a 2
year old child with HUS who died on 20 Sep 2006 and reportedly had recently
eaten fresh spinach. E. coli O157 has not been detected in the child.
Maryland is investigating a suspect case in an elderly woman who died on 13
Sep 2006 and had recently eaten fresh spinach. _E. coli_ O157 was cultured
from her stool, but "DNA fingerprinting" to determine whether it is the
outbreak strain has not been possible.
_E. coli_ O157 was isolated from 9 packages of spinach supplied by patients
living in 7 states. All packages were marketed as baby spinach and labeled
with the same brand name. The "DNA fingerprints" of all 9 of these _E.
coli_ match that of the outbreak strain

The FDA is announcing today that all spinach implicated in the current
outbreak has been traced back to Natural Selection Foods LLC of San Juan
Bautista, California. This determination is based on epidemiological and
laboratory evidence obtained by multiple states and coordinated by the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Natural Selection Foods
issued a recall of all implicated products on 15 Sep 2006. 4 other
companies have issued secondary recalls because they received the recalled
product from Natural Selections. Spinach processed by other manufacturers
has not been implicated in the outbreak.
FDA, the State of California, CDC, and the USA Department of Agriculture
continue to investigate the cause of the outbreak. This includes continued
inspections and sample collection in facilities, the environment, and
water, as well as studies of animal management, water use, and the
environment.
Next Steps
Although the current outbreak may ultimately trace back to a specific
field(s), there has been a long history of _E. coli_ O157:H7 outbreaks
involving leafy greens from the central California region. Spinach
processed by other manufacturers has not been implicated in this outbreak,
however, based on discussions with industry, and given the past _E. coli_
O157:H7 outbreaks, FDA and the State of California expect the industry to
develop a comprehensive plan which is designed to minimize the risk of
another outbreak due to _E. coli_ O157:H7 in spinach grown in central
California. While this plan is under development, FDA and the State of
California reiterate our previous concerns and advise firms to review their
current operations in light of the agency's guidance for minimizing
microbial food safety hazards.
Advice to Retailers, Restaurateurs and the Public
FDA is still reminding the public that Natural Selection Foods has recalled
all spinach products under multiple brand names with a date code of 1 Oct
2006 or earlier. There have been 4 other recalls from different companies
because they received Natural Selection Foods spinach.
In order to protect consumers, retailers and restaurateurs should not sell
raw spinach or blends that may contain spinach that was processed by
Natural Selection Foods and all other brands subject to the recalls.
Consumers are advised that proper storage of fresh produce can affect both
quality and safety. To maintain quality of fresh produce, certain
perishable fresh fruits and vegetables (like strawberries, lettuce, herbs,
and mushrooms) can be best maintained by storing in a clean refrigerator at
a temperature of 40 degrees F (5 degrees Celsius) or below. All produce
that is purchased pre-cut or peeled should be refrigerated to maintain both
quality and safety. Many precut, bagged produce items like lettuce are
pre-washed. If so, it will be stated on the packaging. This pre-washed,
bagged produce can be used without further washing.
Processed spinach (such as frozen and canned spinach) is not implicated in
this outbreak.
States involved and number of cases
The 26 affected states are: Arizona (7), California (2), Colorado (1),
Connecticut (3), Idaho (4), Illinois (1), Indiana (9), Kentucky (8), Maine
(3), Maryland (3), Michigan (4), Minnesota (2), Nebraska (9), Nevada (1),
New Mexico (5), New York (11), Ohio (25), Oregon (6), Pennsylvania (9),
Tennessee (1), Utah (17), Virginia (2), Washington (3), West Virginia (1),
Wisconsin (49), and Wyoming (1). In addition, Canada has one confirmed case.
Laboratory findings
There are now a total of 10 confirmed product samples that contain the _E.
coli_ O157:H7 outbreak strain:
- The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment has confirmed
the presence of the outbreak strain of _E. coli_ O157:H7 in a sample of
Dole spinach with a lot code of P227A02, and a "best if used by" date of 30
Aug 2006.
- The Ohio Department of Health confirmed the isolation of _E. coli_
O157:H7, matching the outbreak strain, from a package of bagged spinach.
- The Wisconsin Department of Health and Family Services has confirmed that
_E. coli_ O157:H7, the same strain as that associated with the outbreak,
has been found in 2 bags of Dole Baby Spinach with lot codes of P227A.
- The Nevada Department of Health and Human Services has reported a
confirmed finding of _E. coli_ O157:H7 in bagged spinach, matching the
outbreak strain. The Nevada sample was analyzed by FDA Pacific Regional Lab
NW.
- The Pennsylvania Department of Health has confirmed that _E. coli_
O157:H7, the same strain as that associated with the outbreak, has been
found in 2 individual bags of Dole spinach purchased in Pennsylvania with a
"best if used by" date of 30 Aug 2006, and a lot code of P227A01.
- The Utah Department of Health (UDOH) and the Salt Lake Valley Health
Department (SLVHD) have confirmed that _E. coli_ O157:H7, the same strain
as that associated with the outbreak, has been found in a bag of Dole Baby
Spinach purchased in Utah, with a lot code of P227A01. Laboratory tests
were conducted by the Utah Public Health Laboratory (UPHL).
- The New Mexico Department of Health announced on 20 Sep 2006, that it had
linked a sample from a package of spinach with the outbreak strain of _E.
coli_ O157:H7. DNA fingerprinting tests determined that the strain from the
spinach matches the strain from patients in the outbreak. The package of
spinach that tested positive was Dole Baby Spinach, with a lot code of
P227A03.
- The Illinois Department of Public Health has confirmed that _E. coli_
O157:H7, matching the outbreak strain, has been found in a package of Dole
Fresh Spinach with a lot code of P227A02, and a "best if used by" date of
30 Aug 2006.

Natural Selection Foods, the company whose bagged spinach is at the
epicenter of a massive _E. coli_ outbreak across the country, on Thursday
announced that it has begun an aggressive testing plan similar to one
launched by the meat industry after Americans started dying from eating
hamburgers more than a decade ago. "We need to move to a different level of
food safety," said Charles Sweat, the company's chief operating officer.
Starting on Tue, 3 Oct 2006, all spinach, lettuce and other leafy greens
entering the company's processing plant in San Juan Bautista began
undergoing random sampling for _E. coli_, salmonella and other pathogens by
a third-party testing company. "It's like a fire wall that we're putting
between the fields and processing plant," Sweat said at a news conference
in a historic plaza next to the Old Mission in San Juan Bautista. Sweat
said he hoped his company would help develop new standards across the
produce industry -- which has been under severe criticism for not getting
ahead of a deadly problem it knew was simmering for years.
Natural Selection has hired a team of food-safety consultants. One of them,
microbiologist Mansour Samadpour, said that he was hopeful that the cause
of the E. coli contamination would be pinpointed, but it's possible that
Natural Selection and the American public may never know. He said the
random sampling plan will involve testing about 60 samples for each lot --
about 4 pallets -- of fresh produce. He said he didn't know what percentage
that represents, but that it's a standard developed by the International
Commission for Microbiological Specifications for Food."When you test the
product and it's positive, it's not going to go through the plant," he
said. "It's going to get dumped."
Before widespread publicity about _E. coli_ contamination began scaring
customers away from beef in the mid-1990s, the meat industry had also
resisted costly sampling programs. But the industry now embraces sampling.
Sweat said on Thursday that tests by state and federal investigators have
not turned up any evidence that the contamination was introduced at the San
Juan Bautista plant. He said his company would pay the "out of pocket"
medical expenses of people sickened by spinach packaged by Natural
Selection. The company has set up a toll-free number -- (888) 736-2840 --
so that people made ill by spinach can call for claim information.
The produce industry is also developing a set of voluntary food-safety
guidelines that it hopes will satisfy the FDA and other federal and state
regulators.

[Although the case number has slowly increased towards 200, the
investigation has come up with multiple "smoking guns" (bags of spinach
with the outbreak strain isolated) and localized the source essentially to
a single place on a single day on a single shift. How the spinach became
contaminated is still unclear. - Mod.LL]
