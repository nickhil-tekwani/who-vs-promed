State announces steps to prevent anthrax outbreak
-------------------------------------------------
The state government has announced emergency measures to contain a possible outbreak of anthrax among cattle. The move comes in the wake of an anthrax outbreak reported in Tamil Nadu's Theni and Cumbum districts, bordering Idukki district in Kerala. The government on Tuesday night banned cattle from Tamil Nadu being brought to the state through the check posts in Idukki district.

On Wednesday [9 Jan 2013], the state animal husbandry department launched an action programme to vaccinate the cattle along the state's border districts. Special emphasis is on Idukki district, owing to its proximity to Cumbum and Theni. A total of 3 Rapid Response Teams each in all districts have been mobilized for this purpose. Each team is led by a livestock inspector.

Authorities are also collecting blood samples of the cattle that are brought into the state from Tamil Nadu. Officials at the check posts under the animal husbandry department have been given instructions to ensure the collection of blood samples. The samples will be sent to district laboratories for examination.

More than 20 cattle had fallen down dead in Cumbum and Theni on 5, 6, and 7 Jan 2013. After tests conducted on the blood samples of the [affected] cattle confirmed anthrax, the carcasses were buried 8 feet under the ground to prevent the spread of bacteria.

"The spots where the cattle fell dead are places where an anthrax outbreak was reported earlier. Such places are bound to see outbreaks every year, if the cattle are not vaccinated regularly," said K G Suma, the director of state animal husbandry department.

Suma also said the state government has contacted the Tamil Nadu authorities and confirmed that no more cattle deaths were reported there after Monday [7 Jan 2013]. However, he said the ban on cattle from Tamil Nadu will continue until the state receives word from the Southern Regional Diagnostic Disease Laboratory in Bangalore.

[Anthrax is enzootic in Tamil Nadu, not least because of the contaminated waste water downstream from slaughter houses and hide processing plants. In the past 5 years it reported 8 mixed cattle and small ruminant outbreaks in 2006, 2007 (12), 2009 (11), 2010 (4), and in 2011 (10). For good or ill they rarely report human cases these years, but this might just be a bureaucratic oversight.
