The Department of Health (DOH) in Sultan Kudarat is monitoring an "Ebola-like virus" that has killed at least 10 people in the province since April [2014].

Back in March [2014], more than 100 residents of Barangay Tinalon in Senator Ninoy Aquino town were rushed to the hospital due to stomach pains, vomiting, and diarrhea after eating what doctors believed was tainted horse meat. Several of the victims died. At that time, medical officials were baffled as to what kind of illness struck the victims. Samples of horse meat were sent to a laboratory for testing. [A more detailed report of these cases can be seen in ProMED-mail archive no. 20140520.2483556).

The DOH is checking whether the virus came from a bat and was transferred to the horse killed and eaten by residents of Senator Ninoy Aquino town.

Based on the laboratory results, the residents were hit by an acute encephalitis syndrome, a biosafety level 4 disease, making it as fatal as Ebola virus.

The [Ebola virus disease] illness is transmitted through body fluids. It has an incubation period of from 4 to 27 days. "It starts with a simple flu, but you can die in one week's time. 'Yung preparation natin dito ay the same sa preparation natin sa Ebola' ['Those preparations here are the same as preparation we have Ebola'; unclear machine translation]. Regional Epidemiology and Surveillance Officer Dr. Alah Baby Vingno said.

The disease has killed 10 residents since April [2014].

The DOH is setting up an information campaign, as well as training its personnel to deal with acute encephalitis syndrome.

The agency is also reminding the public to observe proper hygiene to ward off deadly diseases.

[Information is not adequate to speculate on what the etiology of these cases might be. No evidence is presented that the virus is Ebola-like, or even if a virus is involved. Reston Ebolavirus is present in the Philippines, but affects pigs and non-human primates mainly. In the horse near-related fatalities reported in ProMED-mail archive no. 20140520.2483556, Mod.LL suggested in that post that a Hendra-like virus might be involved, and the above report mentions bats, which are the Hendra virus and Nepah virus reservoirs. Geographically, Nipah virus seems more likely because it occurs in Southeast Asia. Since that earlier report, there have been 3 additional fatalities. The laboratory results indicating that these were cases of acute encephalitis syndrome provides few clues about the etiology of those cases, nor if toxicants were ruled out. If additional tests were done or detailed results of previous tests are available, ProMED would appreciate receiving that additional information.
