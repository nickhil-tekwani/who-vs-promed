Anthrax found on teacher's drums
-----------------------------------
A drumming teacher has told a fatal accident inquiry she had not
"thought deeply" about the possible health risks of importing West
African drums.

Christopher "Pascal" Norris, 50, died in 2006 after attending a
drumming workshop and class in the Borders. Mr Norris, of Stobs near
Hawick, died a few days after attending a drumming workshop in Kelso
and a class in nearby Smailholm. 2 drums owned by Geraldine Keita
tested positive for anthrax, a hearing at Edinburgh Sheriff Court was
told. Mrs Keita claimed her workshop had been made a "scapegoat" as
only its drums had been tested for anthrax.

The inquiry heard that a dun dun and a djembe drum owned by Mrs Keita
tested positive for anthrax. The dun dun was used at a workshop in
Kelso which Mr Norris attended on the Sunday before he died. Asked
whether Mr Norris played the instrument himself, Mrs Keita said she
could not remember, as he had his own drum with him that day. He also
attended a drumming class in Smailholm on Tue 4 Jul 2006.

Mrs Keita told the inquiry that she had imported a number of drums
from the Republic of Guinea, a country she visited in 2004 to study
drumming. While there she met drumming teacher Nansady Keita, whom
she later married. Mr Keita arranged for drums to be flown to her in
the UK. Mrs Keita, 34, said that she asked Scottish Enterprise for
advice on importing as she planned to set up a business.

Sheriff Principal Edward Bowen QC asked: "Did it ever cross your mind
that there might be health risks regarding imports from that country?
In terms of importing did it ever occur to you?"

She replied: "I had not thought deeply about the specific risks
associated with what I was doing."

After Mr Norris's death health officials contacted her, said they
needed to take samples of the drums and told her to stop classes
immediately. Initially they were given the all-clear, but she was
later told that there were problems with 2 of the drums.

Mrs Keita said that there were 20 to 30 drummers at the Kelso
workshop, many with their own drums. She questioned why none of
these had been tested. She said: "I don't believe anybody else's
drums except ours were tested, which doesn't make sense to me. It
seems we were a bit of a scapegoat really. They found it on ours so
let's not look anywhere else because then where do we go? It just
gets bigger." She suggested that the anthrax spores could have ended
up on her drums through cross-contamination at the workshop.

The inquiry also heard from her husband, who was asked if he had ever
heard of anyone becoming ill and dying after playing the drums. He
replied: "This is the 1st time I've seen a situation like this."

Anthrax case lacks 'simple' cause
---------------------------------
A medical expert has told a fatal accident inquiry there was no
"simple answer" why only one man had contracted anthrax from infected drums.

Christopher "Pascal" Norris, 50, died after attending classes where 2
drums used were later found to carry spores. One theory was that Mr
Norris, who was in remission for leukaemia, may have had a weakened
immune system. However, a consultant haematologist said that did not
explain why he alone had contracted the infection. Ashok Okhandier
said many factors, including the common cold, could weaken the immune system.

Mr Norris, from Stobs near Hawick in the Borders, used a drum he made
himself when attending 2 classes in Roxburghshire days before his
death. He is not thought to have used the infected drums at the
class, although people sitting nearby were playing them.

Mr Norris, 50, died in the early hours of 8 Jul 2006, after being
rushed semi-conscious to Borders General Hospital the day before. Not
suspecting anthrax, Mr Okhandier said he feared Mr Norris's leukaemia
from 2002 had returned, but blood tests showed no sign of the cancer.
Brain and lung scans revealed Mr Norris had severe pneumonia and
meningitis, caused by an unknown infection. The root of the
infection, anthrax, was not known until laboratory tests came back 2
days after his death.

At the inquiry at Edinburgh Sheriff Court, fiscal depute Martin
Macari asked Mr Okhandier if the reason Mr Norris had picked up
anthrax could be explained by his earlier leukaemia. "One of the
parts of this inquiry is to establish why Pascal Norris suffered from
anthrax when so many other people who were exposed to this did not,"
said Mr Macari. "Obviously one major health factor was that he had
leukaemia and was in remission. Would that explain why he alone was affected?"

The consultant replied: "I don't think there's a simple answer to
that." The inquiry continues.

[The consultant haematologist at the Borders General Hospital has had
2 years to put together his opinion. Presumably he had more to say
than was reported. Unfortunately the BBC journalist report on this
inquiry left it as one short sentence.

The inquiry has yet to present evidence as to whether Mr. Norris was
exposed to any spores from any of his own drums. It has been hinted
at the exposure came outside his home and workshop, e.g., Kelso; see
20071028.3505. To be continued. - Mod.MHJ]
