Kenya: 9 prisoners die of typhoid at Coast Province hospital
------------------------------------------------------------
9 prisoners have died in a confirmed outbreak of typhoid at Shimo la Tewa
Prison in Mombasa, the Coast Province's largest prison. KTN's [Kenya
Television Network] Mombasa staffer Victor Mwasi visited the prison today
and confirmed that up to 30 inmates have been admitted to the prison's
health center. Another 4 have been admitted to Coast Province hospital [Mwasi].
Shimo la Tewa Prison [is] home to more than 3000 prisoners. Prison officers
confirmed that 9 prisoners have died and 30 others are undergoing treatment
in the Coast General Hospital. The prison officer in charge, Richard Mbima
[phonetic] further admitted that the prison health facilities have no
capacity to meet the medical needs of the prison's population. Sick
prisoners are instead referred to the Coast General Hospital.

[_Salmonella typhi_ is endemic in much of the developing world and
epidemics can occur in times of strife such as war or famine. Unlike most
_Salmonella_ species, which are zoonoses, the typhoid bacillus and its
'cousin' _S. paratyphi_ are infections only of man and are acquired by the
fecal-oral route via contaminated food or water. Direct spread from person
to person can occur but is uncommon. The circumstances around this outbreak
have not been not reported but it is likely that the sanitary conditions at
the prison are less than ideal, facilitating food or water spread.
A mortality rate of about 23 per cent may be high for this disease when
treated, but the overall poor health and poor nutritional status of the
prisoners may account for this. Strains of typhoid that are multidrug
resistant may also contribute to a higher mortality rate. What, if any,
antimicrobial therapy was given and whether the strains were multiresistant
have not been reported. In a classic description of typhoid in the
preantimicrobial era (Stuart BM, Pullen RL: Typhoid. Clinical analysis of
360 cases. Arch Intern Med 1946; 78: 629-61) the mortality rate overall was
about 13 per cent increased with age (6 per cent under 21 years old, 20 per
cent from 21 to 40 years, 28 per cent in over 40s). - Mod.LL]
