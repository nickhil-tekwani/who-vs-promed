Norovirus Outbreak Affects Caribbean Cruise Ship Passengers
-----------------------------------------------------------
More than 200 passengers on a Royal Caribbean cruise ship and several
crew members took ill with a stomach virus [viral gastroenteritis]
during a week-long cruise, the Miami-based company said on Sat 4 Mar
2006.
Royal Caribbean International said 243 of 3252 passengers on board
the "Explorer of the Seas" had contracted a norovirus infection, a
common cause of infectious gastroenteritis prevalent in hospitals,
nursing homes, cruise ships and other semi-enclosed environments. All
those affected were treated.
19 of the 1184 crew members also became ill during the voyage, which
made stops in Belize, Mexico's Yucatan and the Cayman Islands. The
vessel is due back in Miami on Sun 5 Mar 2006.
Royal Caribbean said it believed a passenger brought the virus on
board. Noroviruses are thought to affect an estimated 300 million
people around the world every year, the cruise line noted.

[Outbreaks of norovirus-associated viral gastroenteritis have frequently
affected cruise ships operating in the Caribbean, which carry passengers
anxious to escape the rigors of the northern hemisphere winter. Unfortunately,
such passengers tend to bring with them viruses prevalent during winter
months, such as the noroviruses which causes "winter vomiting disease." This
is the 1st report this year (2006) of such an outbreak. There is no preventive
vaccine, and the symptoms of disease disappear before medication can take
effect.
Shipping companies have become expert at decontaminating their vessels at the
end of a cruise, and it is likely that this ship will be prepared in time for
the next cruise with little risk of infection other than that introduced by a
member of the next group of passengers. - Mod.CP]
