[1] India (Bengal): COVID-19-dengue coinfections
Date: Sun 9 Aug 2020

The complexities around COVID-19 are confounding doctors and governments across the world. But West Bengal is now facing a challenging albeit entirely predictable complication -- COVID-19 and dengue 'co-infections' amid the onset of the tropical disease's season.

The state, which is in the midst of a worsening COVID-19 outbreak, has now started to see these co-infections. While any official number of such patients is not available as of now, several hospitals said patients testing positive for COVID-19 are later being diagnosed with dengue infection too, or vice-versa.

According to experts, this creates an extremely critical condition in patients as COVID-19 causes blood to clump while dengue causes bleeding that does not allow blood to clot. This creates an extremely critical condition in a patient.

The Mamata Banerjee government last week issued guidelines and protocols to hospitals for treating such cases.

[2] PAHO: complications and sequelae of COVID-19
Date: Wed 12 Aug 2020

https://www.paho.org/en/documents/epidemiological-alert-complications-and-sequelae-covid-19-12-august-2020


More than 7 months following the 1st report of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), knowledge of the complications and sequelae of this disease has increased substantially. Through this alert, the Pan American Health Organization/World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) urges Member States to keep health professionals informed as new information continues to become available in order to strengthen the timely detection and proper management of COVID-19 cases, complications, and sequelae.

[These countries had been selected based on having had significant surges of SARS-CoV-2 infections but different responses. In some cases, transmission was almost interrupted, but resurgences have occurred, and countries have handled them differently. One observation is that lifting of restrictions has led to major resurgences in some areas; in others, early new threats seem to be importations, but community spread does recur. Good contact tracing has helped to shorten the time with new clusters, and temporary new restrictions have had an impact. Countries not implementing restrictions have done more poorly, with major resurgences. Spain has been added again, as it is dealing with a 2nd wave after lifting of restrictions, primarily focused in Catalonia and Aragon. - Mod.UBA]

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 215. In the 24 hours since the last WHO update:

- The Americas region reported 47.1% of the global newly reported and 59.5% of newly reported for this 24-hour period, maintaining its dominance as the most severely affected region, having reported more than 10.6 million. The USA reported 39.4% of (39 894), followed by Brazil 21.8% (22 048), Colombia 10.0% (10 142), Argentina 7.3% (7369), Mexico 5.5% (5558), Peru 5.0% (5109), and Chile 1.5% (1572).

- The European region reported 11.1% of the global newly reported and 7.3% of the newly confirmed globally. Russia reported 21.3% (5102) of the regional newly confirmed, followed by Kazakhstan 8.8% (2114), Israel 7.3% (1756), Ukraine 6.0% (1443), Spain 5.9% (1418), France 5.4% (1293), Germany 5.1% (1226), Romania 5.1% (1215), Turkey 4.9% (1183), UK 4.8% (1148), the Netherlands 3.3% (779), Uzbekistan 2.8% (670) and Poland 2.3% (551).

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 5.7% of the global newly reported and 8.5% of global newly reported fatalities. Iraq reported 27.5% (3396) of the regional newly reported, followed by Iran 19.0% (2345), Saudi Arabia 12.3% (1521), Morocco 9.2% (1132), Pakistan 5.9% (730), Kuwait 5.6% (687), Palestinian Authority 3.8% (473), Bahrain 3.3% (407), Qatar 3.1% (384), Lebanon 2.5% (309), and Libya 0.10% (12). Cases are continuing to increase in Iraq and Morocco. This region remains highly active, with multiple countries still in a surge mode.

- The African region reported 2.9% of the global newly reported and 4.4% of newly reported fatalities. South Africa reported 39.7% (2511) of the newly reported in the region in the past 24 hours, followed by Ethiopia 9.2% (584), Kenya 7.8% (497), Algeria 7.7% (492), Nigeria 6.7% (423), and Ghana 3.0% (192).

- The Western Pacific region reported 2.2% of the global newly reported and 1.0% of global. The Philippines reported 60.8% (2900) of the newly reported in the region, followed by Japan 26.9% (1282), Australia 6.6% (316), Singapore 1.3% (61), China 1.3% (61), and South Korea 1.1% (54). The Philippines, Japan, and Australia continue to have elevated transmission.

- The South East Asia region reported 30.9% of the global newly reported and 19.2% of global. India reported 91.8% (60 963) of newly reported in the region, followed by Bangladesh 4.5% (2996) and Indonesia 2.5% (1693). India continues to be the driving force of the dominance of this region.

Impression: The overall picture is basically the same, even with residual weekend reporting artifact. The ordering of the regions has the Americas having the highest disease load and newly confirmed on a daily basis followed by the South East Asia region, then Europe followed by the Eastern Mediterranean, followed by the Africa region, and the Western Pacific region representing the lowest daily caseload of all the regions. While regional proportions may not reflect this, most of the regions have countries that have resurgences of associated with lifting of restrictions.

[The USA, Brazil, and India are still the most severely affected countries in terms of cumulative case counts. In the past 24 hours, these 3 countries -- India (67 066), followed by Brazil (58 081), and USA (54 345) -- account for over half of all confirmed globally (52.4%). There were 6821 deaths reported in the past 24 hours.

In descending rank order, India is number one for the number of newly confirmed in the past 24 hours, followed by Brazil, USA, Colombia, Peru, Argentina, Mexico, Russia, Philippines, and Iraq. The range in the top 10 daily newly confirmed goes from 3441 to 67 066. Other hotspots are seen in the countries numbered 11-20 in this list: Spain, Bangladesh, South Africa, France, Iran, Indonesia, Bolivia, Israel, and Chile; their range of reported new cases is 1552 to 3172. - Mod.UBA

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, there is minimal change change (an increase of 1.2%,) and looking at daily reported deaths, the change is virtually not changed (increased by 0.75%). The key question still remains as to whether transmission is in fact slowing down or whether this is a reporting artifact. Time will tell, but following the data reports showing major surges in countries that had been showing successes makes one wonder what is driving these reporting variances (I haven't changed my mind!).

Impression: The SARS-CoV-2 is still actively being transmitted in all regions of the world, and many countries are showing increases in their daily newly confirmed case counts and mortality, while the global 7-day averages seem to reflect a slowing down of reporting confirmed; albeit, I still wonder whether this is real or reflects a changing pattern with decreased testing. For example, the USA reported data suggests a slowing down of transmission over the past 2 weeks as seen by the comparative 7-day averages in reported new and (see section [3E] above), but if one looks at the percentage of positive PCR tests, in the past 2 weeks the positivity rate is stable at 9%, consistent with significant ongoing transmission that is not abating (see https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/testing-in-us.html). The most severely affected region is the Americas, with increasing daily, even though the comparative 7-day average suggests things may be slowing down (or reporting is slowing down). - Mods.UBA/MPP]
