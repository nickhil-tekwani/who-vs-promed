West Nile Virus Infection of Sheep & Goats: Request For Information
-------------------------------------------------------------------
"Where is the proof that this was West Nile? Clinical signs are
absolutely not proof; many neurological diseases are much more common
in sheep and goats. Positive titers alone are not proof. Apparently
many cows will seroconvert but do not develop disease. Virus
isolation would be more convincing. IgM capture ELISA testing might
be suggestive. Were there any more facts?"
I received the above response when I forwarded the ProMED-mail post
"West Nile virus, caprine & ovine - USA (NE) (02)" to a Veterinarian
at UC Davis and to others concerned about Bighorn Sheep native to
California and whether they too could be susceptible to West Nile
virus.
Are there any more positive data about the accuracy of the West Nile
virus diagnosis?
