The 1st case of the Schmallenberg virus (SBV) on a Scottish farm has been confirmed.

Scotland's Rural University College (SRUC) said a deformed calf born into a Dumfriesshire suckler herd had tested positive for the virus.

Last month [March 2013], 8 dairy cows on SRUC's Barony Campus outside Dumfries had tested positive for antibodies to SBV, although there has been no evidence of any calving problems with that herd. The deformed beef calf is the 1st animal in Scotland to be identified as actually having the disease [see comment].

"The report of this recent calving in Dumfriesshire would indicate SBV was spread by midges in the area during last autumn [2012]," said Brian Hosie, head of SAC [Scottish Agricultural College] Veterinary Services.

"We would urge farmers to be more alert than ever to potential problems among cattle or sheep and discuss any concerns with their veterinary surgeons."

SBV is spread by midges and classically causes brain defects and foetal malformations, particularly deformities of the limbs.

The virus was first identified in the south of England in early 2012 having spread from mainland Europe. The disease has gradually spread north and has been identified among lambing flocks and calving herds in other parts of England and Wales.

The effects can be variable with some farms suffering high lamb or calf mortality while other herds or flocks suffer few effects.

SBV is not notifiable in the UK and no restrictions are placed on infected premises. Best practice guidelines for those sourcing stock from risk areas can be found at http://www.sruc.ac.uk/info/120151/disease_hot_topics.

[By saying "actually having the disease" the report means, in fact, "having a clinically manifested SBV case (a deformed calf)".

Further information is available on Defra's SBV site at http://www.defra.gov.uk/ahvla-en/disease-control/non-notifiable/schmallenberg/
and the EU site at http://ec.europa.eu/food/animal/diseases/schmallenberg_virus/index_en.htm.

The SBV situation and international status are expected to be discussed during OIE's 81st General Session from 26 to 31 May 2013, in Paris.- Mod.AS
