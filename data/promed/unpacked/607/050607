Foot-and-mouth disease confirmed in SW China
--------------------------------------------
China's Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) said Monday [7 Jan 2013] that foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] infections were confirmed in livestock in Southwest China's Sichuan province.

A total of 30 pigs at a slaughterhouse in the city of Guangyuan showed symptoms associated with FMD on Saturday [5 Jan 2013], according to the ministry.

The National FMD Reference Laboratory [Harbin] on Monday [7 Jan 2013] confirmed that those pigs were infected with FMD type-O, it said.

To prevent the disease from spreading, local authorities have sealed off and sterilized the infected area, where a total of 124 pigs have been culled and safely disposed of, according to the MOA.

"The disease is now under proper control," it said.

FMD is a contagious and sometimes fatal viral disease that affects cloven-hoofed animals, including domestic and wild bovid.
