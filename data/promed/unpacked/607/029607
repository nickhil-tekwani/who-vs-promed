I've found the article in "Der Spiegel". It reports that since the middle of
1993 a total of 154 brains were examined: plaques as those of the 10 british
V-CJD were not found. Explicitly, it was referred to:

- a 36 year old woman working as a catering assistant and being frequently in
contact with calv brain.

- an owner of a pet shop having frequently eaten soup on basis of marrowbone

- a butcher

- between Oct 1993 and Oct 1994 6 farmers with CJD

The "lifelong vegetarian from Germany" and the one who "had lived in
Australia for the last 12 years" in Oz's message reading..., dated Tue, 18 Jun 96 20:59:18> weren't mentioned in this article.

The Australian was apparently considered a UK case for some reason.

If I understand you correctly then NO cases with the flower-like plaques
have been reported in Germany as far as the Der Spiegel article in May
96 is concerned. So I can presume that none are implicated with V-CJD
and that these are normal sporadic cases.

[- Maybe one might presume that the Der Spiegel article was bassed on
a published study and that more details are available. If anyone knows
of such an article or the author, we would appreciate details. Thanks.
