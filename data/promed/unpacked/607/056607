UNDIAGNOSED HEMORRHAGIC DISEASE - NAMIBIA (02): WINDHOEK, COMMENT

In this context (Namibia), we need to consider in the differential
diagnosis a mycotoxin present in food, resulting in the Onyalai
disease. In the past, we have been confronted by this disease in
Kuito, Angola.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Van Herp for drawing attention to this
possibility.

The following description of Onyalai disease is reproduced from the
web-site of the Institute of Tropical Medicine Antwerp
http://www.itg.be/itg/DistanceLearning/LectureNotesVandenEndenE/45_Haematologyp6.htm:

"General: Onyalai (syn. akembe and afindo) is a rather mysterious
disease which only seems to occur in central southern Africa (southern
Angola and northern Namibia; Kavango and Ovambo territories). Onyalai
means "blood blister" in the language of the Kimbundu, an Angolan
tribe. Onyalai is a disease of unknown etiology. Defective nutrition
may be the cause. One hypothesis is that a toxin, possibly acting as a
hapten, is responsible for this form of thrombocytopenia. The possible
aetiological role of mycotoxins from contaminated millet, sorghum
and/or maize requires further investigation.

Clinical aspects: The disease differs clinically, epidemiologically
and immunologically from idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP).
The age of onset varies from 6 months to 70 years with a peak
incidence between 11 and 20 years. It is an acute disease,
characterised by the formation of haemorrhagic vesicles and blisters
on the palatal and buccal mucous membranes, together with severe
thrombocytopenia. Sometimes, haemorrhagic blebs do appear on the skin,
including on the soles of the feet. The general condition tends to be
good, and there are no signs of a constitutional disorder. This
acquired form of thrombocytopenic purpura can lead to haematuria and
melena. Epistaxis, petechiae and ecchymoses are common, as are
subconjunctival bleeding and menorrhagia. The median duration of
bleeding is about 8 days, but recurrent bleeding episodes are common.
About 80 percent of cases will have chronic thrombocytopenia with a
risk of intermittent attacks of acute haemorrhage. Haemorrhage from
ruptured bullae, epistaxis or gastrointestinal bleeding can be severe
and may cause shock and even death.

Diagnosis: The diagnosis is a clinical one, supported by lab tests.
There will be thrombocytopenia and anaemia. The platelets are
morphologically normal. The bone marrow shows changes which are to be
expected: hyperplasia of the red cell precursors and megakaryocytes.
Many patients have IgG and IgM platelet antibodies and glycoprotein
IIb/IIIa autoantibodies in their serum. Complement levels are normal.
Infants of mothers with onyalai, unlike infants of mothers with
idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, are not at risk of
thrombocytopenia and haemorrhage. Their mothers however, have a risk
of post-partum haemorrhage.

Differential diagnosis: Differential diagnosis includes other
conditions which are characterized by severe thrombocytopenia, such as
ITP, HIV-associated thrombocytopenia, immune thrombocytopenia
secondary to SLE or lymphoproliferative disease, drug-related
thrombocytopenia (e.g. quinine, heparin), TTP-HUS, hypersplenism and
diffuse intravascular coagulation (DIC). Several infections are
accompanied by low platelet counts (e.g. malaria, leptospirosis,
septicaemias, trypanosomiasis, Marburg virus and arboviral infections
such as Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever and dengue). DIC is common in
certain obstetric disorders (eclampsia, abruptio placentae, amniotic
fluid embolus, septic abortion, hydatidiform mole), envenomation
(several snakes), heat stroke and traumata. Suicide attempts with
coumarines is common and leads to bleeding tendency, but is not
accompanied by low platelet counts or haemorrhagic bullae on the
mucosa.

Treatment: Treatment is directed at the prevention of haemorrhagic
shock, and management consists of the correction of blood loss.
Transfusion of blood and of platelets can be life saving. Oral hygiene
is important. The use of aspirin is of course prohibited.
Corticosteroids do not increase the platelet count, although high-dose
methylprednisolone reduced the morbidity of onyalai in children. High
dose intravenous gammaglobulin (Sandoglobulin) may be followed by a
rise in the platelet count and cessation of haemorrhage, but in
general, this treatment is disappointing (and expensive). Vincristine
sulphate (1.5 mg/m2) can be used, as it benefits some patients.
Splenectomy can be considered for patients with severe uncontrollable
bleeding, although splenectomy does not always control the disease.
Splenectomy is followed by a rise in platelet count. If possible,
vaccination against pneumococci should be performed before
splenectomy."
