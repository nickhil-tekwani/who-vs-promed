An investigation into how a small but dangerous outbreak of _E. coli_ sickness that began in the North County on 31 Jul 2013 is still underway.

So far 4 cases have been identified, one more case since The Tribune previously reported the outbreak on 3 Aug 2013. All have been confirmed as being a dangerous strain of the bacterium called _E. coli_ O157, according to Christine Gaiger, a communicable disease program manager with San Luis Obispo County Public Health Services. "_E. coli_ can be life-threatening, but not always," Gaiger said. "None of these were."

The health department is researching where those affected came in contact with the strain and to see whether they got it from the same source. "We think it's from the same source, but we're still waiting to see," Gaiger said.

Two cases were reported on 31 Jul 2013, a 3rd on 1 Aug 2013, and the most recent on 6 Aug 2013. 2 cases were reported by local hospitals after admitting patients, and 2 cases, including the most recent, were reported by local emergency rooms where the ill sought care. 3 of the cases were reported from the North County, while the 4th and newest case came from elsewhere in the county; officials declined to disclose where.

Isolated cases of this illness are common year-round, but county health officials say the current batch of cases is odd because they occurred so close together. While the identities of the sick have not been released other than to say they're not all children, The Tribune learned independently that one of the people hospitalized was a 12-year-old girl from the Creston 4-H Club who showed a dairy goat during the California Mid-State Fair. Friends of the girl said she was out of the hospital and had improved. The health department declined to disclose whether the fair is being investigated as a possible point of origin.

Officials expect to have more information regarding the cluster by the end of August 2013.

[The state of California can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at http://healthmap.org/r/3DHP. A county map can be seen at http://geology.com/county-map/california.shtml.

Genetic analysis of the isolates is needed to assess whether there is a common origin of these illnesses and a parallel epidemiological investigation is needed to look for common foods and locations. It is tempting to focus primarily on the California Mid-State Fair as livestock exposures at such events including petting zoos are well known sources of enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_, the prototype of which is serotype O157:H7, but the epidemiology of the other 3 cases is not provided.

It is interesting that one of the cases occurred in a 4-H member showing a dairy goat because in almost all of the outbreaks related to livestock exposures, cases occur in visitors rather than a parallel group of adults and children with daily exposure to the colonizer animals. This has suggested that previous exposures of individuals to EHEC can act to confer a degree of protection against symptomatic infection (1-3).

Second episodes of EHEC do occur as noted in a recent media publication regarding a woman who had enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ illness twice, the 1st time in the seminal Jack-In-The-Box outbreak in 1982 involving undercooked hamburgers (4) when the organism literally burst on to the microbiological scene.
