The Hajj: communicable and non-communicable health hazards and current
guidance for pilgrims
--------------------------------------------------------------------
The Hajj [annual pilgrimage to Mecca in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
(KSA)] has become the epicenter of mass migration of millions of
Muslims of enormous ethnic diversity. No other mass gathering can
compare, either in scale or in regularity. Communicable disease
outbreaks of various infectious diseases have been reported
repeatedly, during and following the Hajj. The Hajj 2010 starts in the
1st week of November 2010 and this report is a timely reminder that
many infectious diseases can be avoided or averted by adopting
appropriate prophylactic measures.

Preventive measures during Hajj in Saudi Arabia
-----------------------------------------------
The KSA provides free health care to all pilgrims during the Hajj and
also implements stringent infection control measures. In 2009, the KSA
MoH [Ministry of Health] prepared 24 hospitals with a total bed
capacity of 4964, of which 547 were critical care beds. Moreover 136
health care centers in the vicinity of the Hajj were equipped with the
latest emergency management medical systems and staffed with 17 609
specialised personnel to provide state of the art health care to all
pilgrims free of charge.

A large number of public health officers ÂŠcontrol the ports of entry
for all pilgrims (land, sea and airports) and ensure compliance with
Saudi MoH requirements for performing Hajj. In addition 39 public
health teams are distributed around where the Hajj takes place. These
include 18 stationary teams located in health care facilities and 21
mobile teams, which rotate through the different pilgrim camps.

At the Hajj terminal based at King Abdulaziz International Airport in
Jeddah, the key port of entry for the majority of pilgrims, an
independent, newly renovated Hajj terminal now accommodates 80 000
pilgrims at any one time. At each of its 18 hubs receiving pilgrim
flights there are 2 clinical examination rooms and a large holding
area to assess arriving pilgrims and check their immunisation status
and administer any recommended prophylactic medicines. Any pilgrim
with a suspected communicable disease requiring isolation will be
escorted back through the airport grounds by ambulance to a nearby
dedicated 200-bed hospital.

The public health teams (stationary and mobile) as well as the ports
of entry teams report directly to the command center on 9 communicable
diseases using an electronic surveillance form based on an updated
disease case definition submitted via mobile phones. These diseases
include influenza, influenza-like illness, meningococcal disease, food
poisoning, viral hemorrhagic fevers, yellow fever, cholera, polio, and
plague.

Meningococcal disease
---------------------
During the Hajj, carrier rates for meningococcal disease (MCD) rise to
a level as high as 80 percent [5] due to intense overcrowding, high
humidity and dense air pollution. When rates of carriage rise to this
level, the risk for meningococcal outbreaks becomes a real concern.
The largest meningococcal outbreak among pilgrims occurred in 1987
with meningococcal serogroup A affecting pilgrims in Mecca and
internationally [6]. After implementing vaccination with the bivalent
A and C meningococcal vaccine as a requirement for attending the Hajj,
no further outbreaks due to serogroup A occurred.

In the years 2000 and 2001, 2 large outbreaks of meningococcal
serogroup W135 occurred among pilgrims and their families in Saudi
Arabia and internationally [7]. A change of the Hajj pilgrimage
requirements from bivalent to quadrivalent (A,C,Y, W135) meningococcal
polysaccharide vaccine eliminated future meningococcal outbreaks [8].
Concerns still persist about hyporesponsiveness to the serogroup C
component of the polysaccharide quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine
despite repeat dosing [9].

Lack of herd immunity and persistence of meningococcal carriage among
vaccinated pilgrims with the polysaccharide vaccine prompted the Saudi
MoH to replace the local recommendations for meningococcal vaccination
from polysaccharide to conjugated meningococcal vaccine [10].
Excessive cost of available conjugated meningococcal vaccines
prohibited the MoH from mandating this recommendation to all
international pilgrims.

Acute respiratory tract infections
----------------------------------
Acute respiratory tract infections are very common during the Hajj,
particularly so when the pilgrimage falls in the winter season. The
close contact among pilgrims during periods of intense congestion,
their shared sleeping accommodations (mainly in tents) and the dense
air pollution all combine to increase the risk of airborne respiratory
disease transmission. A viral etiology of upper respiratory tract
infection (URTI) is most commonly implicated at the Hajj, but
bacterial superinfection often follows. More than 200 viruses can
cause URTI but at the Hajj the main culprits are respiratory syncytial
virus (RSV), parainfluenza, influenza and adenovirus [11].

Tuberculosis
------------
The intense congestion, living in close proximity with vast crowds and
the increasing percentage of elderly pilgrims are all factors
magnifying tuberculosis (TB) risk. Additionally many Muslims travel
from countries of high TB endemicity. The exact risk of TB
transmission among pilgrims is difficult to quantify. A study among
357 Singaporean pilgrims revealed that 10 percent showed a substantial
rise in immune response to the QuantiFERON TB assay antigens post-Hajj
when compared to a pre-Hajj test [12].

Pertussis
---------
Pertussis is another respiratory tract infection of concern during
Hajj. One study found a high incidence of pertussis in Hajj pilgrims
with an overall incidence of pertussis (1.4 percent) during this
one-month-long pilgrimage [13] Hajj pilgrims would therefore benefit
from pertussis vaccination prior to their departure.

Face masks & flu vaccination
----------------------------
In an attempt to reduce the risk of respiratory tract infections
during the Hajj, the Saudi MoH encourages pilgrims to wear surgical
face masks when in crowded places. In addition the MoH recommends that
international pilgrims be vaccinated against seasonal influenza before
arrival into the kingdom of Saudi Arabia with World Health
Organization (WHO) approved strains specific to the northern or
southern hemispheres, particularly those with pre-existing conditions
(e.g., the elderly, people with chronic chest or cardiac, hepatic or
renal disease). In KSA seasonal influenza vaccine is recommended for
internal pilgrims particularly those with pre-existing conditions and
all health care workers working in the Hajj premises.

Blood-borne diseases
--------------------
Muslim men observe completion of a successful Hajj by shaving their
heads. Head shaving is an important means of transmission of
blood-borne disease, including hepatitis B, C and HIV. Illegal
unlicensed barbers continue to operate at the Hajj, shaving hair at
the roadside with non-sterile blades, which are re-used on multiple
scalps. The Saudi MoH encourages all pilgrims to receive the full
series of hepatitis B vaccination prior to travel to Hajj [1]. As
well, all pilgrims should avoid unlicensed barbers and seek approved
licensed barber facilities at the Hajj premises to shave their heads
[1].

Diarrhoea and food poisoning
----------------------------
Traveller's diarrhoea is common during the Hajj, although few studies
have documented its incidence and etiology. The last study was done in
2002 showing that diarrhoea was the 3rd most common cause for
hospitalisation during Hajj. Cholera, an acute bacterial enteric
disease caused by _Vibrio cholerae_, accounted for several outbreaks
after the Hajj [14,15]. The last reported by the MoH was in 1989
affecting 102 pilgrims.

Significant improvement in water supply and sewage treatment has
eliminated such outbreaks. Concerns still persist about importing
cholera with pilgrims from affected countries, which will cause
widespread outbreaks in Mecca. The MoH has strict guidelines on food
importation by pilgrims. Food carried by visitors and pilgrims is
banned and not allowed into the country. Only properly canned foods
and in very small amounts, enough for one person for the duration of
the visit are allowed.

Poliomyelitis
-------------
Poliomyelitis is an acute viral infection that is acquired by
fecal-oral or oral transmission. International spread of polio through
pilgrimage is a major concern for Saudi Arabia. Only 4 countries
(Afghanistan, India, Nigeria and Pakistan) have never completely
interrupted the transmission of wild poliovirus. All pilgrims from
these 4 countries, regardless of age and vaccination status, should
receive one dose of oral polio vaccine (OPV).

Proof of OPV vaccination at least 6 weeks prior departure is required
to apply for an entry visa for Saudi Arabia. These travellers will
also receive a dose of OPV at border points when arriving in Saudi
Arabia. All visitors under the age of 15 travelling to Saudi Arabia
from countries reinfected with poliomyelitis should be vaccinated
against poliomyelitis with OPV. Proof of OPV vaccination is required 6
weeks prior to the application for an entry visa. Irrespective of
previous immunization history, all visitors under 15 years arriving in
Saudi Arabia will also receive a dose of OPV at border points.

Pre- and post-Hajj travel advice
--------------------------------
This year Hajj recommendations were published in the Journal of
Infection and Public Health [17] and will be published the WHO WER
issue No.43, Volume 85, scheduled for release 22 Oct 2010.

[This year the Hajj is expected to fall between 14-18 Nov 2010
(<http://islam.about.com/od/calendar/f/2010hajj.htm>). Hundreds of
thousands of pilgrims perform a series of rituals that include
processions, shaving the head or cutting part of the hair, and ritual
animal sacrifice (<http://www.hajinformation.com/main/f2111.htm>).

Exposure of so many people from around the world to an environment
that is at times confined (such as in tents), overcrowded, strenuous,
and hot may be especially a problem for children, the elderly and
those in poor health from pre-existing chronic illnesses such as
diabetes and chronic renal, heart and lung diseases. The government of
Saudi Arabia recommends that pilgrims should be 12-65 years old and in
good health
(<http://www.moh.gov.sa/english/modules/mysections/article.php?lid=21>).

The above Eurosurveillance article outlines the response of Kingdom of
Saudi Arabia to protect the health and safety of pilgrims who travel
to Saudi Arabia during the annual Hajj. For the official documentation
of full requirements for entry into Saudi Arabia for the Hajj, see the
following websites: Saudi Ministry of Health Regulations (available at
<http://www.moh.gov.sa/english/modules/mysections/article.php?lid=21>)
and the Royal Embassy of Saudi Arabia requirements to apply for a Hajj
visa (available at
(<http://www.saudiembassy.net/services/hajj_requirements.aspx>).

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has also
outlined its recommendations for pilgrims during the Hajj
(<http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/content/in-the-news/Hajj-2010.aspx>).
These recommendations include restricting travel to only those in good
health and being up to date on all routine vaccinations, which include
vaccines for polio, influenza, measles/mumps/rubella (MMR), tetanus,
diphtheria, and pertussis. The CDC also recommends vaccinations for
meningococcal disease, hepatitis A and B, and typhoid. The CDC
specifies the two types of quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine that is
required for the Hajj: meningococcal conjugate vaccine, which is
recommended for people aged 2-55 years, and meningococcal
polysaccharide vaccine, which is recommended for people over 55 but
can be given to people aged 2-55.
