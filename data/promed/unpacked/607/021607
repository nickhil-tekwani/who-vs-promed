A total of 21 people were hospitalized in north east China's Liaoning
province due to an outbreak of anthrax, provincial health authorities
reported through the official Xinhua news agency.

The patients, who were quarantined, belong to the districts of
Haicheng and Xiuyan, although only 3 of them have been completely
confirmed as anthrax cases by doctors.

Anthrax is a bacterial skin disease that can be lethal, affecting both
humans and livestock (in the present case, it is believed that the
victims contracted the disease from sick animals). Anthrax bacteria
have also been used in the past as biological weapons, and were used
for this purpose 80 years ago during the Japanese invasion of
Manchuria, north eastern China, where, incidentally, the current
outbreak is located [not quite; see map. - Mod.MHJ].

[In fact, the Japanese never deployed anthrax spores, but they did a
lot of experimentation at Unit 731 using human subjects -- "logs" --
and in one series using spores as a wound contaminant in shrapnel
devices. Anyone wanting to know more can go to:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_731 or read Sheldon Harris's book
"Factories of death: Japanese biological warfare 1932-45 and the
American cover-up," Routledge, 1994. ISBN 0-415-09105-5 ISBN
0-415-93214-9. You don't want to read it before hoping to go to sleep.
