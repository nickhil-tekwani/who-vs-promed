Influenza update number 248, based on data up to 4 Oct 2015
------------------------------------------------------------
Summary
-------
Globally, influenza activity generally decreased or remained low in both hemispheres, with only a few countries reporting elevated respiratory illness levels.

- In the Northern Hemisphere, influenza activity continued at low, inter-seasonal levels with sporadic detections. Increased respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) activity was reported in the United States of America (USA).
- Few influenza detections were reported by countries in Africa. In countries with reported influenza activity in both Eastern and Western Africa, influenza type A viruses predominated.
- In tropical countries of the Americas, Central America, and the Caribbean, influenza activity remained at low levels, with the exception of Cuba, where high numbers of severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) were still reported, associated with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus and RSV. In Colombia, acute respiratory activity (ARI) has started to decrease in recent weeks but RSV activity remains high compared to previous years.
- In tropical Asia, countries in Southern and South East Asia reported low influenza activity overall except in India and Lao People's Democratic Republic where increased activity mainly due to A(H1N1)pdm09 virus in India and A(H3N2) virus in Lao PDR continued to be reported. Influenza activity declined in southern China.
- In temperate South America, respiratory virus activity continued to decrease in recent weeks after RSV activity peaked in early July [2015] and influenza virus activity peaked at the end of August [2015]. In Chile, after a later than usual increase and peak in influenza activity in August and early September, ILI activity decreased in recent weeks with decreased influenza A and RSV detections.
- In South Africa, the influenza season ended by mid-September [2015] with only sporadic detections of influenza B viruses in recent weeks. Influenza activity continued to decrease after peaks in mid-August [2015]. Recent influenza virus detections were predominantly influenza B viruses. In New Zealand, ILI activity was just above the seasonal threshold.
- National Influenza Centres (NICs) and other national influenza laboratories from 81 countries, areas or territories reported data to FluNet for the time period from 21 Sep 2015 to 4 Oct 2015* (data as of 15 Oct 2015 13:02:44 UTC).The WHO GISRS [Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System] laboratories tested more than 49 103 specimens during that time period. 2240 were positive for influenza viruses, of which 1495 (66.7 percent) were typed as influenza A and 745 (33.3 percent) as influenza B. Of the sub-typed influenza A viruses, 350 (29.8 percent) were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and 824 (70.2 percent) were influenza A(H3N2). Of the characterized B viruses, 138 (66.7 percent) belonged to the B-Yamagata lineage and 69 (33.3 percent) to the B-Victoria lineage.

[The Global Influenza Programme monitors influenza activity worldwide and publishes an update every 2 weeks. The updates are based on available epidemiological and virological data sources, including FluNet (reported by the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System) and influenza reports from WHO Regional Offices and Member States. Completeness can vary among updates due to availability and quality of data available at the time when the update is developed.
