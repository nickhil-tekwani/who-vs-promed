C. Iran: 593 cases, 43 deaths
Date: Sat 29 Feb 2020

https://medicalxpress.com/news/2020-02-iran-surge-coronavirus-cases.html


Iran on Saturday [29 Feb 2020] reported a surge in new coronavirus cases as the number of deaths jumped to 43, but it dismissed as "rumours" a report the real toll was much higher. Since it announced its 1st deaths from COVID-19, Iran has scrambled to bring the outbreak under control, shutting schools, suspending cultural and sporting events, and halting meetings of the cabinet and parliament.

The health ministry on Saturday [29 Feb 2020] reported 9 new deaths and a 53% jump in infections over the previous 24 hours, taking the overall totals to 43 deaths among 593 cases. That was the highest number of new cases for a single day since [19 Feb 2020], when Iran announced its 1st 2 deaths in Qom, a centre for Islamic studies and pilgrimages, including from abroad.

Health ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour accused foreign media of spreading misinformation about the outbreak. "Given the rumours and false and contradictory content that may be published from satellite networks or media, which are not well-intentioned towards Iranian people, I must say that what we publish as definitive statistics is based on the latest definitive findings of laboratory tests," he said.

Fear of the virus is palpable on the streets of Tehran, which have been less crowded than usual as people apparently stayed at home. Traffic was flowing more freely than normal in the capital on Saturday morning [29 Feb 2020], when it usually chokes the streets at the start of the working week. The office of Tehran's governor announced a reduction in working hours in a bid to reduce the chances of the virus spreading, state television reported.

Shops and pharmacies have been struggling to meet demand as people stock up on bleach, disinfectant wipes, face masks, and other sanitary products, as well as non-perishable food.

"Business... has hit rock bottom because of the coronavirus," said [H], owner of one of Tehran's now-empty restaurants. Large posters have gone up on advertising billboards in the capital urging people to follow hygiene guidelines such as washing hands and not touching handrails and other objects in public places.

Jahanpour said on Saturday [29 Feb 2020] that 205 cases had been detected in the previous 24 hours, increasing the total of confirmed infections to 593. Among the latest infections were a new outbreak of 22 cases in Golestan, a northeastern province on the Caspian Sea coast.

Many of the country's neighbours have reported coronavirus infections in people linked to Iran, and most have imposed restrictions on travel to and from the Islamic republic. On Wednesday [26 Feb 2020], Iranian authorities announced domestic travel restrictions for people with confirmed or suspected infections.

[5] Austria: non-importation case
Date: Sat 29 Feb 2020
From: Dr. Wolfgang Hoepler <w.hoepler@gmx.at>


1st case of an Austrian patient with COVID-19 requiring intensive care treatment due to ARDS
------------------------------------------------------
Tamara Seitz, Wolfgang Hoepler, Emanuela Friese, Sebastian Baumgartner, Christian Clodi, Iulia Niculescu, Viktor Lenhart, Alexander Zoufaly, Dorit Stahl, Taemi Yoshida, Lilian Schaeffl-Doweik, Drina Petener, Franz Weidinger, Christian Madl, Stephan Aberle, Elisabeth Puchhammer-Stoeckl, Alexander Indra, Daniela Schmid, Michael Binder, Christoph Wenisch, Hermann Laferl

We would like to report the 1st case of a critically ill Austrian patient with COVID-19 currently receiving treatment in the intensive care unit of our Department of Infectious Diseases in a negative pressure isolation room at the Kaiser Franz Josef Hospital in Vienna, Austria.

On the 13 Feb 2020, the 72-year-old patient, whose past medical history included hypertension, depression, hyperlipidemia, and resection of a carcinoma of the prostate in 2018, had developed fever and malaise, and the general practitioner referred him to a municipal hospital with suspected pneumonia on [17 Feb 2020].

Initial laboratory results showed reduced white blood cell count (WBC) of 3200 G/l with a normal lymphocyte count, thrombocytopenia (106 G/l) and a slightly elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) of 25 mg/l. The chest X-ray demonstrated bronchopneumonia in the left lower lobe. Therefore, antibiotic therapy with intravenous cefuroxime was started.

In the following days, the patient developed progressive dyspnea, and CRP levels rose up to 213 mg/l. Antibiotic therapy was switched to intravenous levofloxacin.

The patient denied having been abroad in the last few weeks.

Due to further respiratory deterioration, on [26 Feb 2020], the patient had to be transferred to the intensive care unit, where he had to be promptly intubated and mechanically ventilated. The CT scan revealed massive pneumonic consolidations in all lung lobes as in bilateral pneumonia plus ARDS (adult respiratory distress syndrome). Antibiotic therapy was escalated to meropenem plus doxycycline plus linezolid.

On [27 Feb 2020], the PCR from tracheal secretion turned out to be positive for SARS-CoV-2. Consequently, the patient was immediately transferred to our specialized department for isolation and further management.

At the time of admission to our ICU, he was mechanically ventilated with a fraction of inspired oxygen of 45%, PEEP 13, and Pmax 25 mbar; was sedated with moderate doses of propofol and remifentanyl; and received low-dose hemodynamic support with noradrenaline.

The laboratory workup showed normal absolute WBC, an increased neutrophil (82%), and a decreased lymphocyte count (10%), a normal platelet count, a falling CRP of 128 mg/l, and normal liver and kidney function tests.

We continued antibiotic therapy and established experimental antiviral therapy with hydroxychloroquine 500 mg bid (planned for 10 days) and lopinavir/ritonavir 400/100 mg bid. It has not been possible yet to administer remdesivir in a compassionate use program because of the study protocol.

The source of the infection has not yet been clearly defined; the patient owns a renowned company with many international clients.

So far, the PCR results from nasopharyngeal swabs of more than 90 contacts have all turned out negative. The patient himself continues in a critical condition, at the moment with no signs of further deterioration.

[6] Selected media reports of interest
A. USA, Washington state cases without epidemiologic links and 1st death
Date: Sat 29 Feb 2020
Source: King5 News [edited]
https://www.king5.com/article/news/health/coronavirus/coronavirus-death-washington-state/281-5a511b20-4a3f-4380-8d79-15d7a1456887


A King County resident has died from the 2019 novel coronavirus, also known as COVID-19, health officials said Saturday [29 Feb 2020]. This is the 1st known death from COVID-19 in the United States.

There are currently 6 presumptively positive cases of COVID-19 in Washington state, according to State Health Officer Dr. Lofy. These patients include 3 new cases reported Saturday [29 Feb 2020], including the patient who died. It also includes a King County woman and a Snohomish County teenager whose tests came back positive on Friday [28 Feb 2020]. It also includes a Snohomish County man who was the 1st person to be diagnosed in the US in January [2020]. That person has since recovered.

The man who died was a patient at EvergreenHealth in Kirkland. He was admitted with serious respiratory issues and tested positive for the virus. He was in his 50s and had underlying health conditions, according to Dr. Jeff Duchin with Public Health Seattle & King County. The man had no history of travel outside of the US or known contact with anyone who had COVID-19.

The other 2 new patients are connected to the Life Care nursing facility in Kirkland. One is a woman in her 40s who is a healthcare worker at Life Care. She is in satisfactory condition at Overlake Hospital and hasn't had any travel outside of the US, Duchin said. The other is a woman in her 70s and a resident at Life Care. She is in serious condition at EvergreenHealth.

There are over 50 individuals associated with Life Care who have respiratory symptoms or are hospitalized with pneumonia or other conditions and are being tested for COVID-19, according to Duchin. Public Health officials are investigating this as a possible outbreak at Life Care Center. "Current residents and associates are being monitored closely, and any with symptoms or who are potentially exposed are quarantined. As a precaution, all visits to the facility from families, volunteers, or vendors are not allowed," said officials with Life Care Center of Kirkland.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are sending a team of epidemiologists to King County to support local health experts as they work to identify and test new cases.

"While the vast majority of cases of COVID-19 are believed to be mild, the virus can be a very serious infection that can lead to death. Protecting the health of our community and supporting the care of healthcare workers is our top priority," said Duchin.

Gov. Jay Inslee declared a state of emergency on Saturday [29 Feb 2020] in response to the new cases of COVID-19 and directed state agencies to use all resources necessary to prepare and respond to the outbreak. "It is a sad day in our state as we learn that a Washingtonian has died from COVID-19. Our hearts go out to their family and friends. We will continue to work toward a day where no one dies from this virus," said Gov. Inslee. "In partnership with the Washington State Department of Health, the Washington State Department of Emergency Management, and local and community health partners, we are strengthening our preparedness and response efforts. I am committed to keeping Washingtonians healthy, safe, and informed."

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Saturday [29 Feb 2020] there are 22 confirmed cases of COVID-19 across the US. As COVID-19 cases continue to be identified in the state and globally, health officials said it's important to maintain proper health hygiene. This means washing hands with soap and water; avoid touching eyes, nose, and mouth; avoiding large crowded areas if possible; and, most importantly, staying home from work or school if you're sick.

[As mentioned in yesterday's moderator comment, "The identification of 3 cases without identifiable epidemiologic links strongly suggests that we are moving into the stage of "seek and ye shall find." It looks as though states are seeking and now finding. The silent transmission into these communities speaks for the likelihood of more mild clinical presentations and subclinical infections breaking the directly identifiable epidemiologic links.

The possible outbreak of COVID-19 in a long-term care facility with many residents of increased age and with multiple pre-existing co-morbidities is worrisome.

Washington state, like California and Oregon, is located along the western part of the USA with a Pacific coastline. - Mod.MPP]

[In yesterday's ProMED update, there was a report of a man returning to Canada from Egypt, also positive for the SARS-CoV-2. At that point, I commented "The question here is whether the infection was originally acquired in Egypt or in Canada. There have been imported cases into both countries. We await further information. In either location it would signal beneath the "radarscope" transmission." The same applies to returning tourists to France. Did the transmission occur in Egypt or in France? - Mod.MPP]

Highlights
-----
- Two new Member States (Mexico and San Marino) reported cases of COVID-19 in the past 24 hours.

- WHO has published the Rational use of personal protective equipment for COVID-19 [https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/331215/WHO-2019-nCov-IPCPPE_use-2020.1-eng.pdf]. This document summarizes WHO recommendations for the appropriate use of personal protective equipment (PPE) in healthcare and community settings, including the handling of cargo. More information on infection prevention and control (IPC) activities can be found in the Subject in Focus.

Subject in Focus: Update on infection prevention and control
Infection prevention and control (IPC) is a major factor in preventive and mitigation measures for COVID-19. To ensure evidence-based quality guidance and prompt response to global demand for personal protective equipment (PPE), WHO has convened the IPC expert global network of specialists from around the world since the beginning of the outbreak. Experts are members of the Global Infection Prevention and Control Network (GIPCN) or members of relevant institutions caring for COVID-19 patients. This network discusses technical aspects of IPC measures and shares epidemiological updates and experiences across affected countries. In consultation with this global IPC expert network, WHO has released 3 key IPC interim guidance materials (https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/infection-prevention-and-control).

Updates on IPC activities include the following:
- Publishing the guidance document: Rational use of personal protective equipment for COVID-19 (https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/331215/WHO-2019-nCov-IPCPPE_use-2020.1-eng.pdf). This document summarizes WHO recommendations for the appropriate use of PPE in healthcare and community settings, including the handling of cargo.

- Deployment of IPC specialists to Italy to support the COVID-19 response and to facilitate IPC training in the European region.

- Development of frequently asked questions (FAQ) in response to queries from the public and communities on blood safety, PPE for specimen collection, cleaning & disinfection, self-isolation, and self-monitoring.

- Launching the OpenWHO online course "Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) for COVID-19" (https://openwho.org/courses/COVID-19-IPC-EN) on [25 Feb 2020]. The course has been accessed by 15 391 users as of [28 Feb 2020] (see Figure 1).

*Case classifications are based on WHO case definitions for COVID-19.
**Transmission classification is based on WHO analysis of available official data and may be subject to reclassification as additional data become available. Countries/territories/areas experiencing multiple types of transmission are classified in the highest category for which there is evidence; they may be removed from a given category if interruption of transmission can be demonstrated. It should be noted that even within categories, different countries/territories/areas may have differing degrees of transmission as indicated by the differing numbers of cases and other factors. Not all locations within a given country/territory/area are equally affected.
Terms:
- Community transmission is evidenced by the inability to relate confirmed cases through chains of transmission for a large number of cases, or by increasing positive tests through routine screening of sentinel samples.
- Local transmission indicates locations where the source of infection is within the reporting location.
- Imported cases only indicates locations where all cases have been acquired outside the location of reporting.
- Under investigation indicates locations where type of transmission has not been determined for any cases.
- Interrupted transmission indicates locations where interruption of transmission has been demonstrated (details to be determined).

At the same time, the daily number of reported cases and fatalities reported by China keeps decreasing from levels that were 2000-3000 cases daily to less than 500 cases per day.

It is clear that the number of reported confirmed cases differs from different reporting websites and is somewhat a function of time of day the website is updated. For example, I note the time I've accessed the Johns Hopkins website, but by the time the post is actually finished with the editing process, those numbers have at times significantly changed. Case counting is clearly a moving target, and, depending upon when the website updates, the numbers may be different. - Mod.MPP]
