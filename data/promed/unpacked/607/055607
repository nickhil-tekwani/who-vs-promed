After one positive case and over 300 suspects, the scare of the 2nd attack of Nipah virus in Kerala is over, state Health Minister K.K. Shailaja told the media on Saturday [15 Jun 2019].

"Even though the Nipah scare is over, and there is no need for complete surveillance, the situation will be under observation till the middle of next month [July 2019]," Shailaja said.

On 3 Jun [2019], a 23-year-old college student, admitted to a private hospital in Ernakulam, tested positive for Nipah virus. Since then, the health authorities in the state have been on their toes to prevent the virus from spreading. And after almost 2 weeks, Shailaja finally gave the signal that the scare was over.

After 12 deaths were reported last year [2018] in Kozhikode and Malappuram districts following a Nipah outbreak, experts had collected samples from bats. Now, fruit bats have been identified as the carriers of the deadly virus.

The health department is now conducting studies to find out the reasons behind the 2nd Nipah outbreak.

[It is reassuring to know that none of the 316 people in contact with the hospitalized case, 33 of them in the high-risk category, became infected. Because Nipah virus can be transmitted directly from infected to susceptible persons, health authorities in the above situation prudently followed up on contacts and established hospital facilities to handle these types of cases.

The exact circumstances under which the hospitalized case acquired his infection are not stated in the above or in previous reports, or whether the individual had had contact with flying fox fruit bats (_Pteropus giganteus_), the reservoir hosts of Nipah virus, or fruit that the bats may have contaminated.
