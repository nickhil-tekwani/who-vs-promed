A deadly outbreak of squirrel pox has hit Formby, putting the protected red species in danger at the National Trust.

The highly contagious virus carried by grey squirrels has fatal consequences for red squirrels that come into contact with it. Symptoms include lesions around the eyes, mouth and paws and the virus usually results in death.

Experts at the Lancashire Wildlife Trust are urging anyone who sees a sick or dead red squirrel to get in touch with them, after a number of grey squirrels were spotted at Formby in recent weeks.

The last major outbreak of the virus back in 2008 killed 80% of the red squirrel population in the area. Since then, volunteers at Lancashire Wildlife Trust have worked hard to recover the protected species but the latest outbreak could put their hard work in jeopardy.

While grey squirrels do not suffer from any symptoms from the virus themselves, it only takes one of the creatures to come into contact with a red squirrel to spread the pox.

Red squirrels are a protected species across the country, having declined from 3.5 million to 140 000 in under 150 years.

Anyone visiting Formby beach in the coming weeks is therefore being asked not to feed red squirrels, as this helps spread the virus. A spokesman for Lancashire Wildlife Trust said: "If you find a sick or dead red squirrel please report it to Lancashire Wildlife Trust. If the squirrel is obviously sick but still lively then you may need to set a humane trap or get help with capturing it. Please contact Lancashire Wildlife Trust to arrange this. If you have already managed to confine the squirrel, the priority is to get it to a vet as soon as possible - vets will not charge to see wildlife."

Experts at the trust also urged anyone approaching a sick squirrel to remember that they can still bite.

People trying to confine a squirrel are therefore advised to wear thick gloves and use a towel to throw over it, and to carry a cat basket or box with ventilation to transport the infected squirrel in.

[Squirrel pox is a viral disease that only affects squirrels. It is caused by a parapoxvirus that circulates naturally in gray and fox squirrel populations in eastern North America. While these species tolerate the infection, this virus results in fatal disease in red squirrels (_Sciurus vulgaris_), and it has resulted in extensive die-offs in the UK after its introduction in the island by grey squirrels (_Sciurus carolinensis_) from North America. This virus was the main contributor to the red squirrel decline observed in Britain in the last 3 decades.

Dispersal of grey squirrels in Ireland has been slower than that experienced in England and Wales. Until now, the disease was mainly found in England and Wales, sporadically in Scotland, and only a few years ago in Northern Ireland and Ireland, and not elsewhere in the Red Squirrel's European range.
