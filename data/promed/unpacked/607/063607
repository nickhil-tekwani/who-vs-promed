[According to the information included in the European Commission for the Control of Foot-and-Mouth Disease) monthly report "Global Foot-and-Mouth Disease Situation", October 2017: "FMD outbreaks due to serotype O were notified between [30 Sep and 9 Oct 2017] in 5 different epidemiological units, involving small and large domestic ruminants at Buzdyaksky, Republic of Bashkortostan. All the outbreaks were reported as resolved as from [7 Nov 2017]. All the animals present in the outbreaks were destroyed. The FGBI-ARRIAH confirmed the diagnosis on [5 Oct 2017] by conducting PCR on samples taken from the affected species.

"A summary of the animals involved and location of the outbreaks are respectively reported in Table 3 and Map 3 [see report in the link below]. Of note is the particularly high morbidity in the small ruminants, in which the disease is not usually clinically evident. In none of the cases is the origin of the outbreak known and the containment measures adopted are as following: movement control inside the country, surveillance outside containment and/or protection zone, surveillance within containment and/or protection zone, quarantine, official destruction of animal products, zoning, disinfection, vaccination in case of suitable one, and stamping out. No treatment is being administered to the affected animals. Following an immediate notification received from the OIE Delegate of Russia the "country having an FMD free zone where vaccination is not practised" status for Russia, as recognised by the OIE World Assembly of Delegates in terms of Resolution No. 22 in May 2017, is suspended with effect from [30 Sep 2017]."

"The FMDV VP1 sequence of a bovine sample collected from one of the aforementioned outbreaks, submitted by the FGBI-ARRIAH (OIE reference laboratory) to the WRLFMD, was typed as O/ME-SA and the most closely related sequence belongs to the field virus PAK/41/2012 detected in cattle, with relatively low seq id of 95.9 percent. Further to the diagnostic activities carried out in the above-mentioned outbreaks, FGBI-ARRIAH examined for FMDV antibodies 10 406 and 7276 serum blood samples, respectively collected from vaccinated and non vaccinated animals. The FGBI-ARRIAH continues to provide support to the Federal Service for Veterinary and Phytosanitary Surveillance of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Russian Federation and to the Veterinary Services of the Russian Federation by respectively supplying materials and technical advice."
