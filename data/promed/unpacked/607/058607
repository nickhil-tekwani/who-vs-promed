The Department of Health (DOH) sent a team of experts to Albay to study the occurrence of mosquito-borne [virus] disease chikungunya in the province even as outbreaks continue to be reported in several other provinces.

Aside from Albay, the regions of Ilocos, Cagayan Valley, Metro Manila, Calabarzon, Western Visayas, Northern Mindanao, Davao, and Caraga have also reported chikungunya [virus] outbreaks, said DoH Undersecretary Eric Tayag said.

The medical team was sent to Rapu-Rapu, Albay where outbreaks have been recorded as early as July [2012].

Chikungunya [virus causes] a disease caused [transmitted] by _Aedes aegypti_, which is also the same mosquito that causes dengue to spread. Chikungunya [virus infection] is not [usually] fatal, and affects mostly adults.

Tayag also noted that Cagayan de Oro was the first to report an outbreak a few months after it was badly hit by tropical storm Sendong.

"We want to find out because we see the pattern. The 1st to report chikungunya [virus infections] this year [2012] is Cagayan de Oro and that was after Sendong," Tayag said.

However, he said a chikungunya outbreak was already seen in Cagayan de Oro even before Sendong. This is why doctors are carefully studying whether there is a link between the devastation brought by Sendong and the rise of chikungunya [virus infections] in the province. "Many went there for relief. It is possible they got bitten by mosquitoes before they left. That's what we think happened. We are looking at the link," Tayag said.

Last month [September 2012], an outbreak was also recorded in Surigao del Sur, the DoH official noted.

A total of 600 cases have been recorded this year [2012]. It is unlikely that cases this year will surpass last year's 1000 cases, Tayag said.

[The report above indicates that the outbreaks of chikungunya virus infections are expanding to new areas. Although the numbers of confirmed or suspected cases are not given in the report, comments by officials from the MoH indicate that the outbreaks are increasing in number. As of 8 Oct 2012, there were 500 suspected cases and 58 confirmed ones. Chikungunya virus is doubtless endemic in the Philippines, having caused sporadic outbreaks in 1954, 1956, 1968, and 1985 to 1986 (see ProMED-mail archive no 20120929.1315954), mainly in the center and south areas of the country. Since there is no commercially available vaccine, the only preventive measures are mosquito vector control and avoidance of mosquito bites.
