More than 40 people were poisoned from a village feast in Hohhot, the
capital city of northern China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, on
Saturday, local health authorities told Xinhua Sunday.
Those poisoned, aged from 6 to about 70, received emergency rescue services
at a local hospital, and they are all out of danger, the authorities said.
Some of them are still hospitalized.
The food poisoning occurred Saturday when a couple from Datai Village of
Hohhot held a feast at the local restaurant to celebrate 100 days after
their baby's birth. Many of the guests suffered dizziness and felt
nauseated and tired.
Preliminary tests showed that the soup that the patients had at the feast
contained a great deal of nitrite, a type of industrial material and food
additive. The cause of the accident is under further investigation.
