Infectious [viral] gastroenteritis caused by norovirus is spreading,
and in many cases patients were infected indirectly, as they touched
other patients' vomit or excretion, or the norovirus was transferred
to food or tableware via people's hands. The following advice from
experts at the Health, Labor and Welfare Ministry offers possible
preventive measures at home and advice on how to clean up vomit from
sufferers of the virus.
The disease caused by norovirus is generally known as food poisoning
that [may] occur after eating such bivalve shellfish as raw oysters
and clams. However, only 15 percent of cases last year were
attributed to such [uncooked] shellfish. Many cases in recent years
resulted from people failing to wash their hands sufficiently after
touching patients' vomit or other excretions containing a large
amount of the virus, or failing to thoroughly clean rooms where
patients were treated. Experts assume that the surviving virus
infected others through food.
The most effective preventative measure is to wash hands carefully.
Antiseptic solution, ethanol and soap available in ordinary stores
cannot kill noroviruses, but it is thought that washing hands well is
a good way to stop the virus from becoming attached to the fingers.
It is important to wash hands well with soap before meals, cooking
and after going to the toilet.
If you feel nauseous before going to bed, place a container at the
bed side should you have to vomit. If the bed linen is stained with
vomit, remove it carefully with a cloth, taking care to collect it
all. Wash the bed linen by hand, separately from other laundry. Wash
carefully and avoid inhaling the spray of the washing machine water.
To [destroy] noroviruses, bleach containing sodium hypochlorite and
heating clothes at 85 C or higher for at least a minute are
effective. Washing clothes with water or ordinary detergents cannot
remove viruses. Bleach should be diluted with water according to the
label. Use carefully, as bleach can cause some types of material to
lose color or become damaged.
It is recommended to soak the laundry in boiling water, dry at high
temperature, and iron it. As a futon [a type of bed mattress used in
Japan] is hard to wash, iron it with a steam iron after drying it
well.
Remove vomit on the floor or carpet, with a paper towel or cloth and
clean the patch repeatedly with a cloth or mop. After use, the cloth
should be cleaned to kill any remaining viruses. If it is
insufficiently cleaned, the virus might escape into the atmosphere
when the cloth dries and others inhaling the viruses may become
infected. Sodium hypochlorite also is contained in kitchen bleach,
toilet bleach and mold-remover for bathrooms. But cleaning the floor
with cloths containing sodium hypochlorite may damage and change the
color of the flooring.
During the New Year's holiday, there will be more opportunities to
dine out, so if you choose bivalve shellfish from the menu, make sure
they are well cooked. Soaking cooking utensils and tableware in
boiling water or cleaning them with kitchen bleach also kills the
virus. Shoji Miyakawa, deputy chief of the ministry's Safety Division
said, "It's important for each of us to make efforts to eliminate the
virus as much as possible to prevent the disease from spreading."

The record-breaking nationwide outbreak of gastroenteritis caused by
norovirus may stem from a mutation of the disease, an expert said Wed
20 Dec 2006. The highly contagious virus has typically been
transmitted by eating raw oysters and clams, but this season's
epidemic comes mostly from human-to-human infections and can best be
explained by a possible outbreak of a new virus strain by, for
example, mutation, said Shigeo Matsuno, a senior researcher at the
National Institute of Infectious Diseases. "The cause . . . is not
eating raw oysters," Matsuno said. "It must be human-to-human
infection in most cases. It is natural to think that the infection
spread so rapidly because many people have no immunity to the virus."
Oysters and other bivalves often cause norovirus infection because
they concentrate the virus after taking it in along with plankton in
the water. Apart from [uncooked] bivalve consumption, infection
occurs orally when viruses in substances excreted or vomited are
somehow transmitted, and in places where people are in close
contiguity, such as nursing homes and schools. Oral infection with
only a small number of norovirus particles -- less than 100 -- is
known to cause gastroenteritis that brings stomach pain, severe
diarrhea and vomiting.
Some 3000 medical institutions across Japan reported they treated 65
638 infected patients between 27 Nov and 3 Dec 2006, a record-high
average of 21.8 per institution, compared with 19.8 logged in the
preceding week, also a record. Norovirus infection statistics have
been compiled since 1981. In previous instances, the number of cases
reached a peak after mid-December.
With the rapid increase, the institute is concerned that the outbreak
of norovirus gastroenteritis may show "the largest-ever spread" and
is calling for people to wash their hands with soap as a way to
prevent an epidemic. On Monday, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe urged
Health, Welfare and Labor Minister Hakuo Yanagisawa to initiate
action against the epidemic.
A public junior high school in Kitami, Hokkaido, closed Tuesday
following a suspected norovirus outbreak, with 58 of the school's 416
students, and one teacher, suffering symptoms that include vomiting
and abdominal pain since Saturday.

Travel advice
-------------
Traveling overseas sometimes means the specter of infectious disease,
such as the case of two Japanese men who died of rabies, one in
November and the other in December, from separate dog bites in the
Philippines. Medical experts say there are 5 major areas of concern
when traveling abroad. Most conspicuous is enteritis caused by
Escherichia coliform bacillus, salmonella and noroviruses. It is also
called traveler's diarrhea because of its symptoms.
"About 10 percent of Japanese staying overseas for a week suffer from
the disease. You should be on alert not only in developing but also
in advanced countries," said Atsuo Hamada, acting director general of
the Japan Overseas Health Administration Center at the Japan Labor
Health and Welfare Organization.
The stomach's defenses are liable to become weaker due to fatigue
from traveling, and food and drink become a source of infection.
Therefore, it is important to select mineral or boiled water and to
eat cooked food, he said. Influenza, colds and other respiratory
infectious diseases also need caution. When it is arid, viruses
easily get into the throat and the nasal mucosa. The risk rises when
travelers find themselves in such arid environments as aircraft,
buses and hotels, and when large numbers of people gather in a small
space. Washing your hands, gargling and drinking large quantities of
water are a must, said Hamada, who is also an executive of the
Japanese Society of Travel and Health.
Travelers are also asked not to approach places where live birds are
sold in light of concerns over avian influenza.
The 3rd source of infectious disease is the bite of a mosquito.
Dengue fever, spreading chiefly in Southeast Asia and Latin America,
causes headaches and joint pain, and the disease can sometimes become
serious. Malaria is spreading in tropical and subtropical zones.
Annually, about 100 Japanese develop symptoms of the disease after
returning home, and several have died. Travelers to places where
mosquitoes are a problem should not expose their hands and legs. Wear
long sleeves and trousers and use an insect-repelling spray. The 4th
area of concern for infections comprises sexually transmitted
diseases such as HIV and syphilis and those that can be contracted at
medical institutions in developing countries, including HIV and
hepatitis B. "In addition to cautious deeds, travelers are asked to
choose a clean hospital as far as possible," Hamada said.
The 5th concern is rabies. Because the virus is also carried by
mammals other than dogs, the typical source of infection, travelers
should not approach animals without caution. If bitten, they should
immediately go to a hospital, he said.
"Before going abroad, travelers should confirm what infectious
diseases are spreading, where hospitals are located and how to
receive treatment. Depending on the circumstances, they should
consider getting vaccinations beforehand," Hamada said.

Japan has been hit by an outbreak of a common stomach virus,
prompting the prime minister to call for steps to deal with
infections that have reached a record high this winter. Over 65 600
people throughout the country are thought to have been infected by
norovirus between 27 Nov and 3 Dec 2006, the highest since data was
first collected in 1989, according to the National Institute of
Infectious Diseases. Four people living at nursing homes, 3 in their
90s, died due to the [norovirus] infection which causes severe
diarrhoea and vomiting, the Asahi newspaper reported yesterday,
saying all but 2 of Japan's 47 prefectures have issued warnings of a
potential epidemic.
"Prime Minister (Shinzo) Abe has given instructions to the relevant
ministries to prevent the spread of the infection," Chief Cabinet
Secretary Yasuhisa Shiozaki told a news conference. The Health
Ministry says there are no vaccines against the virus and advises
people to wash their hands carefully before eating and after using
the toilet. Shares in companies that make products to protect against
norovirus have shot up on the Tokyo stock exchange, with hand wash
and gargle maker Meiji Seika Kaisha Ltd jumping 11.5 per cent in the
past week. Other beneficiaries include clinical reagents maker Eiken
Chemical Co, whose have risen 14.8 per cent in a week.
The ministry said shellfish including oysters should be thoroughly
cooked to destroy the virus, as it is often found in such seafood.
Norovirus has caused mass infections in other countries, including
the United States, where hundreds of passengers on a cruise ship fell
ill to it in 2 separate incidents in early December and in November.

At least 69 primary, middle and high schools in 17 prefectures have
temporarily suspended school or classes since November, as
gastroenteritis caused by the highly infectious norovirus continues
to spread, according to a Yomiuri Shimbun survey of prefectural
boards of education.
Norovirus is highly infectious and spreads rapidly. Schools hope the
epidemic will taper off during winter holidays. Seventeen schools in
Hokkaido and Akita, Fukushima, Ibaraki, Nagano and Niigata
prefectures have closed temporarily, including 12 primary schools, 2
middle schools, 2 high schools and one school for disabled children.
Six primary schools and a high school of 5 prefectures temporarily
suspended all classes for one grade. Forty-five primary and middle
schools in 12 prefectures also suspended classes temporarily.
However, the actual situation could be even worse than reported
because prefectural boards of education are aware only of cases
reported to them by municipal boards of education -- which are not
obligated to report such cases to prefectural boards of education.
In Niigata Prefecture, 5 schools closed entire schools or classes for
certain grades. A Nagaoka primary school recorded the prefecture's
highest number of the gastroenteritis victims when 72 of its 410
students called in sick on 30 Nov. Sixty-one students who came to
school also complained of stomachaches, and 30 percent of all
students showed symptoms of gastroenteritis.
Norovirus was detected in some of the students. Because no outbreak
was reported at middle schools that use the same school meal
provision service, the epidemic likely was not food-borne, but an
infection that spread among the students. The primary school was
closed the next day and resumed usual classes on 5 Dec 2006. However,
new cases have continued to appear even as recently as Monday.
In Odate, Akita Prefecture, food poisoning from meals provided
through a school food service has struck many students and staff.
Primary and middle schools in the city reported a surge in absent
students from 14 Dec, and 8 schools closed temporarily on the
afternoon on 15 Dec. According to the city board of education, 443
students, teachers and school staff had developed infectious
gastroenteritis caused by norovirus as of Thursday [21 Dec 2006].
The Odate Health Care Center traced the cause of the food poisoning
to bread that was on the menu of all the schools, and norovirus was
detected in an employee of the company that made the bread. Some
infected students apparently passed on the virus to their families.
In Saitama Prefecture, primary schools in Ageo, Honjo and Kawagoe
closed classes temporarily. The prefectural board of education
instructed municipal boards of education to provide students with
advice about hygiene. But despite these efforts, the epidemic has
continued in many areas since.
The Education, Science and Technology Ministry told prefectural
boards of education to take steps to ensure adequate hygiene levels
are maintained at schools.
