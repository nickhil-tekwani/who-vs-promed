Contact lens-related fungal corneal infections (Update 3)
---------------------------------------------------------
Investigations are still ongoing on the cause of the recent reported incidence
of contact lens-related fungal corneal infections. As a precautionary measure,
Bausch & Lomb (S) Pte Ltd (B & L) has voluntarily suspended sales of its ReNu
multipurpose solution and is cooperating with the Ministry of Health and
Health Science Authority in the investigations.
In response to the spike of cases in Jan 2006, MOH had initiated active case
finding of fungal corneal infections that have occurred since 2005. As of 20
Feb 2006, MOH has found 39 cases of fungal corneal infection (which tested
positive for _Fusarium_) with a history of contact lens use.
Out of the 39 cases, 34 said that they had used ReNu, 4 were unsure of the
brand of contact lens solution they used and one other had used a different
brand.
Majority (92 percent) of the 39 cases started developing infection in the 2nd
half of 2005 onwards. There are 20 males and 19 females. Most (74.4 percent)
of the cases comprised teenagers and young adults. Half (48.7 percent) of all
the cases were in the 15-24 years age group while an additional quarter (25.6
percent) were aged 25-34 years.
In view of the potentially serious adverse visual consequences of fungal
corneal infection, the Ministry of Health strongly advises all contact lens
users as a precautionary measure to discontinue the use of B & L ReNu
multipurpose contact lens solution for the time being, until the causes behind
this recent increase in infections can be more clearly ascertained. B & L will
advise consumers on what to do with existing stocks of their product.

The Ministry of Health (MOH) would like to alert the public to the increasing
incidence of contact lens-related fungal corneal infections. The Singapore
National Eye Centre (SNEC) had noticed a spike of 7 cases of fungal corneal
infections in Jan 2006. A retrospective review of cases in SNEC revealed a
total of 19 patients had been treated at SNEC for culture-positive fungal
corneal infections due to the _Fusarium_ fungus species since May 2005 (i.e.
about 1 to 2 cases per month). The Ministry was further notified this week of
3 new cases in Changi General Hospital.
The high incidence of fungal corneal infections is unprecedented, as most
corneal infections related to contact lens use had previously been bacterial
in nature. Fungal infections of the cornea are also more difficult to treat
and can have adverse visual consequences if diagnosed and treated late. Some
of the patients have suffered significant loss of vision in the affected eye
as a result of the fungal corneal infection. 3 patients had to undergo urgent
corneal transplantation.
All the patients used disposable soft contact lenses, which were cleaned and
stored with multi-purpose contact lens solution. 18 of the 19 patients seen by
SNEC as well as the 3 patients from CGH reported that they had used Bausch and
Lomb's ReNu multipurpose contact lens solution. Health Sciences Authority
(HSA) has notified Bausch and Lomb of the association with ReNu multipurpose
contact lens solution.
The Ministry of Health is working with the HSA and the SNEC to investigate the
cause of the increased incidence of contact lens-related fungal corneal
infections. HSA is following up with Bausch and Lomb to investigate the
association with ReNu multipurpose contact lens solution. MOH and the Contact
Lens Practitioners' Board (CLPB) have also alerted medical practitioners and
contact lens practitioners to be on the lookout for suspicion of potential
fungal infections of the cornea and refer the lens user to an ophthalmologist
early.
The CLPB reminds contact lens users of the following:
Practise proper contact lens cleaning and care regimes. Lenses must be rubbed
with the fingers and rinsed thoroughly before soaking overnight in a multi-
purpose solution.
Disposable contact lenses must not be used beyond their recommended disposal
period.
The multi-purpose solution in the lens storage case must be changed everyday
even if the lenses are not used daily.
Contact lens storage cases should be replaced at least every 3 months.
Users should stop wearing the lenses if they develop any redness, blurring of
vision or pain of the eye and to seek consultation with a doctor or contact
lens practitioner.�
Alternatively contact lens users may wish to use spectacles instead for the
time being.
The Ministry of Health strongly advises all contact lens users to heed the
above advisory, and will keep the public informed of any further developments.

[This information is derived from
<http://www.doctorfungus.org/thefungi/fusarium.htm>:
_Fusarium_ is a filamentous fungus widely distributed on plants and in the
soil. It is found in normal mycoflora of commodities such as rice, bean,
soybean, and other crops. While most species are more common at tropical and
subtropical areas, some inhabit in soil in cold climates. The genus
_Fusarium_ currently contains over 20 species. The most common of these are
_F. solani_, _F. oxysporum_, and _F. chlamydosporum_.�
As well as being common contaminants and well-known plant pathogens, _Fusarium
spp_ are causative agents of superficial and systemic infections in humans.
Infections due to _Fusarium spp_ are collectively referred to as fusariosis.
The most virulent species in man is _Fusarium solani_.
Trauma is the major predisposing factor for development of cutaneous or
corneal infections due to _Fusarium_ strains. Disseminated opportunistic
infections, on the other hand, develop in immunosuppressed hosts, particularly
in neutropenic and transplant patients. _Fusarium_ infections following solid
organ transplantation tend to remain local and have a better outcome than
those that develop in patients with hematological malignancies and bone marrow
transplantation patients.
Ophthalmologic infections related to fusariosis include keratitis (involvement
of the cornea) and, less commonly, endophthalmitis (involvement of the inner
part of the eye).
Other infections associated with this mold include those of nail, skin, lung,
heart valve, peritoneum, joint, and central venous catheter. Disseminated
infections with or without fungemia due to _Fusarium spp_. have been reported
in immunoincompetent hosts primarily.
Outbreaks of nosocomial fusariosis have also been reported. Existence of
_Fusarium_ in hospital water distribution systems may result in disseminated
fusariosis in immunosuppressed patients. Fusarium may also exist in soil of
potted plants in hospitals. These plants constitute a hazardous mycotic
reservoir for nosocomial fusariosis.
_Fusarium spp_ can produce mycotoxins. Ingestion of grains contaminated with
these toxins may give rise to allergic symptoms or be carcinogenic in long-
term consumption. Fumonisins are the mycotoxins produced by _F. moniliforme_
and _F. proliferatum_ in maize. These toxins may be associated with a risk of
esophageal cancer. - Mod.LL]
