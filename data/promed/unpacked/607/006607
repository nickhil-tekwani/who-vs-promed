[Unless I have miscounted, we have posted more than twice as many messages
about the fascinating influenzavirus A H5N1 episode than there are human
cases. We continue to receive daily postings, some of which are germane,
some of which are not exactly germane but of interest, and some of which
are reporting hysteria and nonsensical responses. I have had two people
from the U.S. ask me whether it is okay to eat chow mein ("Not if it
contains Brussels sprouts."). One report from the Indian press has it that
a virologist there suggested that people returning from Hong Kong should be
screened to detect carriers of the H5N1 variant, going on to say (let me
paraphrase loosely) that this virus has crossed more species barriers than
a rock group.
The January 5, 1998 edition of the South China Morning Post reported that
airports in the Philippines have begun screening and interviewing all
arrivals from Hong Kong for "bird flu". Staff there have been put on alert
for smuggled chickens. A Philippine Airlines spokesman said he was unaware
of such a move. This news came as Indonesia announced it had banned
poultry imports from Hong Kong and China (Hong Kong has not exported
poultry in recent years, so this will cause no economic damage). Several
other countries in the region have announced similar bans. The Indonesian
Health Minister said the government had taken strong measures and the
disease had not been reported in Indonesia (nor have polar bears). Also,
after the press reported dogs and rodents eating the culled chicken
carcasses, people in Hong Kong started killing their pets. Now the United
Arab Emirates has confirmed it has banned imports of poultry from Hong Kong
(doesn't export poultry), China, and Australia, although the UAE has never
imported Australian produce. Yesterday, Romania's veterinary authority
said the deaths of hundreds of chickens there was due to a toxin, not to
"Hong Kong's bird flu"; "specialists" there initially had speculated that a
mystery virus was being spread by wild doves and crows. Today a
pro-democracy politician in Hong Kong, Martin Lee, accused the Hong Kong
government of a cover-up over the "bird flu" crisis and called for an
independent inquiry into its handling of the problem. That's a bit
difficult to believe, given the entree WHO and CDC people have had and all
the media access.
Jim Chin, who has forwarded many reports has noted: "It seems that the
development of ineffective draconian measures to prevent the spread of the
"chicken flu" may not be restricted to Hong Kong - panic and hysteria are
spreading rapidly even, if H5N1 isn't!". Of course, we agree. Personally,
I find these responses fascinating and wonder whether there isn't a
psychologist somewhere who might want to study these illogical responses or
a student looking for a good term paper subject. Rather than post the
details of all these reports, ProMED-mail is posting only reports that
appear to be relevant to the emergence or apparent and potential emergence
of a disease. Below are the relevant reports as well as some interesting
responses from Jim Chin to questions posed to him by Jack Woodall. Others
are invited to comment but we will not drag this out beyond interesting and
useful. - Mod.CHC]

From: Dr. James Chin, CDPC-mail
... Scientists believe the virus lives in the guts of chickens and ducks
and is passed on to people who handle the birds. But they still don't know
how the virus is transmitted, leaving open the possibility that it can be
contracted through person-to-person contact...
Meanwhile, the virus appears to be slowly spreading. Doctors at Queen
Elizabeth Hospital [Hong Kong] say the number of walk-in patients has
increased by 20% since the [first cases were recognized]. "People here have
a lot of demands. They don't just want advice, they want admission -- for
bird flu, or something," Dr. Lee Chi-keung said. Lee says hospital
emergency rooms were "quite chaotic" until a few days ago when the
government issued new guidelines for treating possible bird flu victims.
Now, patients who are panicked or show serious symptoms are given a blood
test and a throat swab for a viral culture. The tests are fairly reliable,
but take weeks, so doctors also conduct a rapid test for influenza A. Any
patient who tests positive for influenza A is hospitalized.
However, because the government doesn't require all patients to be tested,
and because not every patient shows severe symptoms, some patients who may
have the flu may escape an early diagnosis, Lee said. Lee noted that there
are probably bigger social dangers than bird flu. "I would say that
traffic accidents kill much more people than this," he said. "but people
are not worried about walking across the street."
CDPC Note: Dr. Lee's comments are right on the mark!

In an effort to extend its flu surveillance network, China's Health
Department will select 18 private doctors from a short list of general
practitioners and specialists in pediatrics, internal medicine, and
infectious diseases provided by the Medical Association. These doctors,
including one from each SAR [Special Administrative Region = Hong Kong]
district, will be given guidelines on testing patients for [H5N1] in an
attempt to establish how quickly the virus is spreading, and the guidelines
will state the circumstances under which doctors should take throat swabs
for tests (e.g. degree of fever). The Health Department hopes to receive
7-14 samples from each of the 18 doctors per week beginning sometime in
January.

Chinese authorities on Monday maintained that the bird flu virus, which has
killed four people in Hong Kong, had not spread to the rest of China, and
that new tests on chicken farms in the south had revealed no cases of virus
infection. Experts conducted more tests on 1,087 blood samples taken last
month from chicken farms and wholesale markets in the southeastern province
of Guangdong, the China Daily newspaper quoted Ministry of Agriculture
official Chen Guosheng as saying. Chen said there was still no sign of the
H5N1 virus, commonly known as bird flu, which triggered the slaughter of
more than a million chickens in Hong Kong, which neighbors Guangdong
province. Farms and markets in the city of Shenzhen and the Guangdong
provincial capital of Guangzhou -- known in the West as Canton -- have been
given a clean bill of health by animal health authorities. "According to
the results of our testing, as of now, there is no bird flu in Guangdong,"
a health department official assured CNN earlier.
But sources with access to internal government health records in Guangzhou
told CNN that at least three people had died and that others were sick in
local hospitals because of the virus. Some experts believe that the bird
flu originated in southern China -- a theory the authorities reject -- and
an inspection team from the World Health Organization plans to travel to
Guangdong province in the coming daysÂ…
CDPC Note: It may be more accurate to say that the Chinese authorities have
not found H5N1in the chickens they have tested to date. The probability
that H5N1 originated in southern China has not been ruled out.

Questions Jack Woodall and answers by Jim Chin:
W: What is the likelihood that when the flu season kicks off in Hong Kong
next month we'll see dual infections in humans of H3N2 and H5N1. Do you
see any danger in that leading to reassortment in the human?
C: This potential has always existed. This is the prevailing theory, and I
believe in it, but how predictable and what the probability of this turning
out to be the next pandemic strain is the $64 question. It may be that
such episodes occur periodically in southern China and this is one of the
first documentation of such transmission of an animal flu virus to humans,
although it seems likely that the swine flu virus was also probably
transmitted from swine to human and then minimally from person to person
1976. This is all like predicting the next major earthquake in San
Francisco from a few minor tremors. The big public health question is
whether identification of animal flu outbreaks and then mass slaughter of
the implicated animal(s) can prevent the next major human pandemic. I
doubt that there is the political will to continue this. Perhaps we should
focus surveillance on the emergence of a flu strain that is easily
transmitted from person to person?
W: What might you suggest for the current situation?
C: There seem to be too many unknowns to justify further draconian
measures. I would suggest close surveillance on the emergence of a very
transmissable flu virus. I would release statistics as to the proportion
of severe flu-like illnesses that may be due to H5N1, now probably just a
very small percent of all severe flu-like illness.
