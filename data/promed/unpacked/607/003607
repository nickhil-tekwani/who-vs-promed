Dengue fever epidemic under control in E. China province
-----------------------------------------------
The dengue fever epidemic in Cixi, a city of east China's Zhejiang
Province, has been brought under control, the Zhejiang Provincial Health
Department announced on 27 Oct 2004.
To date, 80 of the 83 dengue fever patients detected in Zhejiang have been
discharged from the hospital. The remaining 3 are in stable condition, but
still under medical quarantine.
The No. 1 People's Hospital in Ningbo City, Zhejiang, reported a suspected
dengue fever case in Xiaolin Township of Cixi on 3 Oct 2004. The patient
was confirmed to have the fever the following day. By 14 Oct 2004, 83
dengue cases were reported in the city. The disease did not spread to the
medical workers helping to treat the patients. [Dengue fever is transmitted
by mosquitoes, not directly between humans. - Mod.JW]
Local health departments called on residents to prevent mosquito bites and
to immediately report patients with fever of unknown origin.

[According to the Cixi town website
<http://www.cixiedu.net/webinfo/englishVer/index.asp>,
the town has 37 414 children in school, which translates to a total
population of around 100 000. It seems rather remarkable that an outbreak
of dengue could be controlled in just 2 weeks after only 83 cases, unless
there is only a very small focus of the mosquito vector, or all the cases
were acquired elsewhere. - Mod.JW]

Following the death of a 7-year-old who succumbed to dengue fever at the
R.K. Hospital in Santacruz a few days ago, Brihanmumbai Municipal
Corporation members have alleged that there is a dearth of diagnostic
facilities in the city's public hospitals. The 60 cases detected this year
[2004] could just be the tip of the iceberg, with many more cases likely to
go undetected.
However, BMC executive health officer Dr. R.M. Kathuria has refuted the
number of dengue cases in the metropolis. He said, "There is a significant
decrease in the number of patients infected by the dengue virus. We are
very well-equipped to deal with any such problems."
Congress member Khan Bestiwala alleged that there have been 17 deaths at
the R.K. Hospital alone this year [2004]. "No diagnostic facilities are
available in public hospitals. Only indirect methods, like low blood
platelet count and the antibodies tests, are used for dengue fever," he said.

L.S. (30 years old), a housewife, writhes in pain, as a ventilator helps
her breathe at the Intensive Care Unit of R.K. hospital, Santacruz (east).
It's been 3 days now since she was struck by the potentially fatal Dengue
Hemorrhagic Fever (DHF).
The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has records for 57 cases of
suspected dengue fever. The suspected reasons: A rampant construction boom
greatly multiplying mosquito-breeding sites and new generations of
mosquitoes being born in the October heat.
At a private hospital in Kalina, Santacruz, the start of October [2004] has
seen over 10 diagnosed cases of dengue. In the same area, a 7-year-old from
Kalina succumbed to DHF at Lilavati hospital, Bandra, over the weekend.
So far, the city has recorded 4 casualties from DHF, which causes bleeding
from the nose, mouth, and gums. Without prompt treatment, the blood vessels
can collapse, sending a victim into shock, even death. Could Mumbai see a
repeat of the 1996 dengue death toll of 400 in Delhi?

Dengue on decline but not gone, says MCD
-----------------------------------------------
The health department of MCD [Delhi] says dengue is on a decline. 313 cases
have been reported to date [31 Oct 2004], but the number of reported cases
has been going down over the past 2 weeks.
"76 cases were reported between 10-17 Oct 2004, but the number came down to
42 last week" said Dr. K.N. Tiwari, director of the MCD Health Department.
"Of these, only 19 are from Delhi. An equal number, or fewer, cases might
come in the next 2 weeks and decrease after that."
According to him, of the reported 313 cases, 195 are from the Capital,
while the rest are from adjoining areas. 2 persons have died of the disease
in the Capital. The health minister has asked authorities to continue with
dengue prevention measures for another 15 days.
