More Reblochon cheese from a factory in the French Alps will be removed from the market after children were infected by _Escherichia coli_ linked to the raw milk-based product with one child possibly dying from it, health authorities said on Fri 1 Jun 2018.

French food retailer Leclerc had already issued a recall of Reblochon products produced by cheesemaker Chabert and sold in its own shops under the "Nos régions ont du talent" ("Our regions have talent") brand. That was extended in mid-May 2018 to concern all distributors of the suspect cheese, including retailers Carrefour and Intermarché, which sold the cheese produced in Cruseilles in the Haute-Savoie region under their own brand. The move came after health authorities linked 7 cases of _E. coli_ O26 bacteria among children between 1.5 and 3 years old to the cheese, which is a creamy specialty of the French Alps.

On Fri 1 Jun 2018, the national public health center extended the recall after 14 suspected new cases of children between 1 and 5 were discovered. 6 of the 14 cases of infection involved hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS) with _E. coli_ O26, a potentially serious condition that can cause kidney failure among young children.

"The traceability survey conducted by health authorities after a new infection case ... enabled the identification of new batches of Reblochon that were not targeted by the original recall," the Ministry of Agriculture said in a statement.

The health center said the other 8 cases were still being investigated. One of those children had died and had been affected with HUS, but it was still unclear whether or not it was linked to the child eating Reblochon. It reiterated official guidance that raw milk and cheese made with raw milk should not be given to young children.

[Although it is unclear from this Reuters report, the total number of cases, not the new cases, is 14.

Unpasteurized dairy products remain a potential risk for a variety of pathogens including enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_, either the prototypic serotype or one of the other serotypes, in this case O26. In analyzing the genetic and phenotypic profiles of non-O157 groups of EHEC (enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_), it has been found that they belong to their own lineages and have unique profiles of virulence traits different from the prototypic O157 strain (1). The serogroups appearing to be most prominent are O26, O111, O128, and O103 (2), the O26 serotype being the implicated strain in this outbreak.

To have almost all the cases to be reported be associated with hemolytic uremic syndrome is very unusual; I would suspect that more cases are known or the particular strain is a hyperproducer of Shiga toxin or the specific toxin is more potent.

The following was extracted from Lutwick LI. Enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ infections. In: Confronting emerging zoonoses: the One Health paradigm. Yamada A, Kahn LH, Kaplan B, Monath TP, Woodall J, Conti LA (editors). Tokyo, Japan: Springer, 2014, 77-112:

Risk factors for the subsequent development of HUS after EHEC include children less than 10 years of age, elevated white blood cell counts, persistent low platelet counts without reversal and the use of either antimicrobial agents or antimotility agents during the diarrhea stage before or after bloody diarrhea develops. Since fever is generally not part of the presentation but significant abdominal pain is, patients with diarrhea, significant abdominal pain and no fever should be considered to have EHEC infection, and antimicrobial or antimotility agents should be avoided. Additionally, certain strains -- for example, the so-called clade 8 and the chimeric organism _E. coli_ O104:H4 -- can be associated with a higher risk of HUS.

HUS itself is a thrombotic illness primarily caused by the effects of the EHEC produced Shiga toxin acting on the vascular endometrium of organs where the toxin's receptors are expressed, particularly the kidney and brain. The syndrome consists of the combination of prominent low platelet counts (thrombocytopenia), intravascular red blood cell destruction (hemolysis), and diminished kidney function that can require hemodialysis. Neurological involvement occurs mostly in those who develop renal failure and the central nervous system involvement portends much higher mortality. Indeed, most of the acute mortality relates to neurological disease. Most patients will recover, but some, perhaps 10 per cent, remain with renal failure and require chronic hemodialysis.
