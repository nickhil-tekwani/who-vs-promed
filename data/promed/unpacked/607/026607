Panic spreads as Uganda reports 101 Ebola cases
----------------------------------------------------------------
Uganda has 101 suspected cases of Ebola fever and hundreds more
people being closely monitored, officials said on Friday [7 Dec
2007], as fear grew in Uganda and neighboring countries that the
deadly virus might spread. A total of 22 people have so far died of
the fever and Minister of State for primary health-care Dr. Emmanuel
Otaala told journalists, and 11 health workers have fallen sick.
Another 338 people are being monitored because they came into contact
with those infected by the virulent hemorrhagic fever, which often
causes victims to bleed to death through the ears, eyes and other orifices.

All [cases] were in western Uganda's Bundibugyo district, except for
2 in Kampala, including a doctor who died. Otaala said the cabinet
had approved a pay increase to compensate health workers taking on
the risk of dealing with Ebola. The outbreak, which started in August
[2007], has sparked panic amongst officials, health workers and the
public, with the medical union calling on staff to refuse looking
after patients unless they are issued proper protective gear.

The affected region borders Democratic Republic of the Congo, whose
Ebola river gave the virus its name after some of the 1st cases were
recorded in its valley in 1976. The independent Daily Monitor said
Congo had sealed its border with the district. Congolese officials
denied this. "We have just informed people in the region they need to
be vigilant," Congolese Health Ministry official Dr. Benoit Kabela
told Reuters by telephone from Kinshasa. Kabela said medical staff
had been deployed and given protective gear.

Meanwhile, southwestern neighbor Rwanda said it had set up mobile
clinics and isolation wards at border posts with Uganda. "The
Ministry of Health has deployed trained medical personnel at the
borders," spokeswomen Ines Mpambara said. Kenya is also screening
Ugandans at its western border.

The 4-month delay between the start of the outbreak and confirmation
last week that it was Ebola has raised suspicions the government
covered it up so as not to scare delegates -- Britain's Queen
Elizabeth and 53 heads of government -- who met in Kampala 2 weeks
ago for a Commonwealth summit. The government denies it hid
information. "Confirmation of this epidemic took a long time because
we had to go to (the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
in) Atlanta," Otaala said. The last Ebola outbreak in Uganda was in
2000, when 425 people caught it and more than half died.

New Ebola fatalities push Uganda toll to 25
------------------------------------------------------
A dreaded Ebola outbreak has killed [another] 2 people, bringing the
toll to 25 in western Uganda, an official said Saturday [8 Dec 2007],
as health teams battled to contain the virulent strain in the region.
Health authorities continued to monitor hundreds of quarantined
people who had contacts with the Ebola victims in Bundibugyo
district, home to 250 000 people and the outbreak's epicentre.

"Two people died last night in Bundibugyo, bringing the death toll to
25," said Sam Okware, a health ministry official heading the battle
against the disease. The mysterious strain has so far infected 104
people -- including the 25 dead -- some of them medical workers who
treated patients without latex gloves and respirator gowns.

Experts from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
were studying new blood and tissue samples from western Kanungu and
Kasese districts and northwestern Adjuman district for possible Ebola
infection. The health ministry said the previously unknown Ebola
virus hit the region in September [August in some accounts], simmered
unnoticed while obscured by chaos and [several] other infections with
similar symptoms, until it was identified in late November [2007].
Unlike other Ebola strains, which kill after signature non-stop
haemorrhage, the new strain takes life after provoking mainly high
fever, diarrhoea and vomiting.

Although containing the strain is the priority, epidemiologists are
also scouring the area to search for the source of the virus, 7 years
after it killed at least 170 people in northern Uganda, in a bid to
stall future outbreaks. Spread by body secretions, the blood-borne
disease Ebola was named after a small DRC [Democratic Republic of
Congo, formerly Zaire] river where it was discovered in 1976. It
re-emerged in Sudan later the same year. Other outbreaks have been
recorded in Ivory Coast, Gabon and Uganda. In the previous outbreaks,
the disease struck with initial ferocity causing massive fatalities,
then faded away months later without leaving a hint where it came
from. Experts are still seeking its footprints, if any. Because of
its scanty history, scientists have concluded that the strain is
somewhat containable because it kills its victims faster than it can
spread to new hosts.

[As yet the end of the outbreak is not in sight. The number of cases
continues to rise from 101 on Friday (7 Dec 2007) to 104 on Saturday
(8 Dec 2007), and the number of fatalities has risen from 22 to 25
during the same period. Some 328 people remain under surveillance. - Mod.CP]
