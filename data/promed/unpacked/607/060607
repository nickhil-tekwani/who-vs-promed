Yellow fever in Cote d'Ivoire - WHO Update 7
--------------------------------------------
As of Mon 8 Oct 2001, the Ministry of Health has reported 203 suspected
cases with 21 deaths (in 20 districts of the country), of which 23 are
laboratory confirmed. Included in the overall numbers are 55 suspected case
in Abidjan with 7 deaths, of which 7 are laboratory confirmed.
In response to the first epidemic of urban yellow fever in Africa in 10
years, with the potential for many deaths and very serious humanitarian
consequences, a mass vaccination campaign targeting 2.9 million persons
began on 21 Sep 2001 and ended on 2 Oct 2001. Preliminary data shows that 2
610 994 people were immunized during the 10-day campaign. Vaccinations were
not given on 28 and 29 Sep 2001 in order to replenish vaccine stocks. The
surveillance programme for adverse events following vaccination registered
a total of 59 persons. All these individuals are in good health. There have
been no deaths.
WHO, working closely with UNICEF, has coordinated international technical
assistance from partner institutions in the Global Outbreak Alert and
Response Network. Some 660 volunteers from the local Red Cross Society
played a vital role in social mobilization activities and operational
support to the mass campaign. The Centres for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC), Epicentre, France and WHO provided epidemiological
support to national surveillance for yellow fever in other regions of Cote
d'Ivoire.
WHO is providing support to the National Institute for Public Health (INHP)
to strengthen disease surveillance activities during the post-epidemic
period. CDC and WHO have supported national entomologists in vector
control. Laboratory Services Laboratory specialists from the Institut
Pasteur in Dakar, Senegal and from Lyon, France have assisted the Institut
Pasteur in Abidjan in establishing PCR for virologic diagnosis. The
Institut Pasteur in Paris is supporting their efforts. Coordination
Outbreak response operations are directed by the WHO office in Abidjan and
focal points for epidemiology, immunization, and vector control.
WHO and UNICEF have spent USD 1.1 million on vaccine and supplies.
Procurement and delivery of vaccines and supplies have been completed
through the yellow fever sub-group of the International Coordinating Group
on Vaccine Provision (ICG) in collaboration with Medecins sans Frontieres
(MSF), the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies
(IFRC), UNICEF and WHO. Additional funds are urgently needed to complete
financing of the operation.
