The Extremadura Health Service (SES) has carried out a review of patients admitted to the San Pedro de Alcántara Hospital in Cáceres with respiratory symptoms of poor evolution, detecting 2 more positive cases of [legionellosis], to add to the 7 already declared.

In addition, there is another positive patient who went to the hospital after presenting symptoms since last [3 Aug 2022], that falls within the window period in which most cases were detected, from [2 to 4 Aug 2022]. Of the 10 cases, 6 remain hospitalized, 2 have been discharged and 2 have died, a 54-year-old woman and a 70-year-old man, both with advanced oncological diseases.

From [Thu 4 Aug 2022] to [Tue 9 Aug 2022], Public Health has retrieved 30 samples from different points in the city of Cáceres. To date [Thu 11 Aug 2022], the germ has not grown in any of the [cultures], so for now the samples are negative, although 20 days are needed to get definitive results.

Of note, this is not a _Legionella_ outbreak since there is no epidemiological link between the cases. The only point of union, very weak, that has been found is that most of the cases have been in the area of San Jorge de Cáceres for either work or residence. There is no community health risk in the city of Cáceres.

_Legionella_ is a bacterium that can be found naturally in lakes, rivers and ponds, and that does not post any danger to the health of the population.

There are several species of _Legionella_ and only one of them, _Legionella pneumophila_ serogroup 1, is harmful to human health. [This is incorrect; there are several types of _Legionella_ that are human pathogens. - Mod.ML]. Sometimes it can grow and multiply in the water distribution network and large cooling systems (cooling towers). Its multiplication is favored by the stagnation of water and temperatures between 30-45 deg C [approx. 95 to 113 deg F]. The disease is transmitted by air, by inhaling small droplets of water that allow the bacteria to reach the lungs, sometimes producing a short-term febrile syndrome or pneumonia. [Aspiration of _Legionella_-contaminated water in people prone to aspirate is another mechanism. - Mod.ML]

_Legionella_ infection can manifest with high fever with a mild prognosis and short duration or as pneumonia with high fever.

[Cáceres (pop., 96 000 residents in 2014) is the capital city of the province of Cáceres In Spain, located in the autonomous community of Extremadura (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cáceres,_Spain#External_links). Extremadura is an autonomous community of Spain, located in the central-western part of the Iberian Peninsula, formed by the 2 largest provinces of Spain: Cáceres and Badajoz (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extremadura).

A total of 10 cases of Legionnaires' disease have been reported in Cáceres in a 3-day period of 2 to 4 Aug 2022. We are told that most of the cases have been for work or residence in the area of San Jorge de Cáceres, which is a northern suburb in Caceres. A map showing the location of San Jorge de Caceres can be found at https://mapcarta.com/N3778223174.

We will await the results of genotyping clinical isolates of _Legionella_. Genotyping the isolates from patients with legionnaires' disease will help establish whether this is a common source outbreak if the genotypes match. However, if the diagnosis of legionnaires' disease was based only on a positive urinary antigen assay, there will be no clinical isolates for genotyping. Matching the genotypes of clinical isolates, if available, and environmental isolates of _Legionella_ will identify the environmental source responsible for the individual cases.

More information from knowledgeable sources on this cluster of legionnaires' disease cases in Cáceres, Spain would be appreciated. - Mod.ML
