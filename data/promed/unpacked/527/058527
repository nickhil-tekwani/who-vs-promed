Methicillin-resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_ (MRSA) infections are a
major cause of human skin and soft tissue infections in the United
States (1). MRSA colonization and infection also have been observed in
turtles, bats, seals, sheep, rabbits, rodents, cats, dogs, pigs,
birds, horses, and cattle (2--8), and MRSA infections with an
epidemiologic link to animal contact have been reported in veterinary
personnel, pet owners, and farm animal workers (5,7,8).

On 29 Jan 2008, the County of San Diego Health and Human Services
Agency was notified of skin pustules on an African elephant
(_Loxodonta africana_) calf and 3 of its caretakers at a zoo in San
Diego County. After each of these infections (including the calf's
infection) was laboratory confirmed as MRSA, an outbreak investigation
and response was initiated by the zoo and the agency. This report
summarizes the results of that investigation, which identified 2
additional confirmed MRSA infections, 15 suspected MRSA infections,
and 3 MRSA-colonized persons (all among calf caretakers), and
concluded that infection of the elephant calf likely came from a
colonized caretaker.

This is the 1st reported case of MRSA in an elephant and of suspected
MRSA transmission from an animal to human caretakers at a zoo.

Note: Caretakers blew air with their unmasked mouths into the calf's
trunk to stimulate bottle feeding (its mother had died).

[The above report is another instance of transmission of MRSA between
animals and humans. In this instance, analysis of pulsed field gel
electrophoresis (PFGE) revealed that 8 isolates (2 wound isolates and
one rectal isolate from the elephant calf, wound isolates from 3
caretakers, and nasal isolates from 2 caretakers) were USA300, the
MRSA PFGE type most commonly identified in community-associated MRSA
infections in the USA.

A prior report of MRSA transmission in the USA between humans and pigs
found that the MRSA isolates were not typeable by PFGE using Sma-1,
but multilocus sequence typing (MLST) documented that the isolates
were ST398 (see ProMED-mail post Staph. aureus (MRSA), human, swine -
USA: (IA, IL) 20090126.0348).

Colonization with non-typeable MRSA ST398 has also been reported in
pigs and pig farmers in Ontario, Canada (see ProMED-mail post
20071109.3640). Non-typeable MRSA ST 398 was also detected in the
Netherlands in pigs and pig farmers in 2003 (see ProMED-mail post
archive number 20080605.1799). This strain of presumably animal origin
(nearly 40 percent of pigs in the Netherlands have been found to be
colonized by this strain) is now reported to be responsible for more
than 20 percent of all human MRSA infections in the Netherlands
(<http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/568512> -- subscription
required), and has been found in community-associated human infections
in several European countries, North America, and Asia.

Nosocomial transmission of this strain has also been reported recently
among patients and health care workers in the Netherlands
(<http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/eccmid18/abstract.asp?id=69352).
