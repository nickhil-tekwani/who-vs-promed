Data show that prenatal syphilis screening, although required by law in some states and recommended by the US Preventive Services Task Force and CDC, has not reached 100% among Medicaid recipients in 6 Southern states.

The rates of syphilis among women of childbearing age and congenital syphilis have been simultaneously increasing annually since 2012, according to researchers. The most recent nationwide data indicate 1870 infants were born with the disease in 2019. Healio has previously reported that the United States, unlike other countries, has not been WHO-certified as having eliminated congenital syphilis [https://www.healio.com/news/infectious-disease/20210615/us-sees-shameful-rise-in-congenital-syphilis-cases].

The new study [see citation below] is "the 1st study of syphilis screening among Medicaid beneficiaries in multiple Southern states," Paul Lanier, MSW, PhD, an associate professor in the School of Social Work at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and colleagues wrote in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine [https://www.ajpmonline.org/article/S0749-3797(21)00623-1/fulltext].

Lanier and colleagues analyzed prenatal syphilis screening rates from 504 943 Medicaid claims filed from Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee during fiscal years 2017-2018 and 2018-2019. They also compared the screening rates among women who were enrolled in Medicaid during their 1st trimester of pregnancy with those who enrolled later in their pregnancy.

"It is possible that syphilis screening occurred outside periods of Medicaid enrollment. To address this limitation in Medicaid claims data, 2 subsamples were developed from the larger study sample," Lanier and colleagues wrote.

The 1st subgroup consisted of all the women who met the study criteria -- which excluded women who were simultaneously enrolled in Medicare and Medicaid and those aged younger than 12 years or older than 64 years -- and had one or more days of Medicaid enrollment before their child was born. The 2nd subgroup was limited to those who were registered for Medicaid during their entire 1st trimester.

The researchers wrote that across the 6 states and the entire study period, the percentage of women who had a prenatal syphilis test at any point during their pregnancy ranged from 56% to 91% (mean = 70%) in the 1st subgroup and from 78% to 90% (mean = 83%) in the 2nd subgroup.

In addition, syphilis screening during a woman's 1st trimester ranged from 15% to 62% (mean = 39%) among all enrollees and 32% to 72% (mean = 53%) when considering only those with continuous enrollment in the 1st trimester. Screening rates during the 3rd trimester varied from 9% to 55% (mean = 30%) among all enrollees and 8% to 72% (mean = 35%) among 1st-trimester enrollees. States that did not mandate 3rd-trimester screening had a lower percentage of beneficiaries who underwent screening in the 3rd trimester compared with states that did.

"The findings suggest inconsistencies in policy and practice between states and the need for concerted public health strategies to improve prenatal syphilis screening," Lanier and colleagues wrote.

Abstract
---------
"Introduction. The rates of syphilis among pregnant women and infants have increased in recent years, particularly in the US South. Although state policies require prenatal syphilis testing, recent screening rates comparable across Southern states are not known. The purpose of this study is to measure syphilis screening among Medicaid enrollees with delivery in states in the US South.

"Methods. A total of 6 state-university research partnerships in the US South developed a distributed research network to analyze Medicaid claims data using a common analytic approach for enrollees with delivery in fiscal years 2017-2018 and 2018-2019 (combined N=504 943). In 2020-2021, each state calculated the percentage of enrollees with delivery with a syphilis screen test during the 1st trimester, 3rd trimester, and at any point during pregnancy. Percentages for those with 1st-trimester enrollment were compared with the percentages of those who enrolled in Medicaid later in pregnancy.

"Results. Prenatal syphilis screening during pregnancy ranged from 56% to 91%. Screening was higher among those enrolled in Medicaid during the 1st trimester than in those enrolled later in pregnancy.

"Conclusions. Despite state laws requiring syphilis screening during pregnancy, screening was much lower than 100%, and states varied in syphilis screening rates among Medicaid enrollees. Findings indicate that access to Medicaid in the 1st trimester is associated with higher rates of syphilis screening and that efforts to improve access to screening in practice settings are needed."

In the United States, the number of reported cases of primary and secondary syphilis among women and the number of reported cases of congenital syphilis have increased every year since 2012. Among, US states, Texas ranks the highest for congenital syphilis in 2019, with 138.2 cases of congenital syphilis per 100 000 live births (https://www.cdc.gov/std/statistics/2019/tables/40.htm). The other states with rates of congenital syphilis above the national average (48.5 cases per 100 000) in 2019 are in the South and Southwest, including Arizona (133.1), New Mexico (117.8), Nevada (114.7), Louisiana (111.4), California (94.3), Oklahoma (85.6), Florida (64.8), and Arkansas (56.0). The rate of congenital syphilis in Texas has been 2-3 times higher than the national average for most years between 2010 and 2019 (figure 2, https://www.dshs.state.tx.us/legislative/2020-Reports/2021-Congenital-Syphilis-Report.pdf).

Prevention of congenital syphilis relies on screening and treating pregnant women who are found to have syphilis. CDC recommends syphilis screening for all pregnant women at the 1st prenatal visit, and for pregnant women who are at high risk of contracting syphilis during pregnancy (illicit drug use, STIs [sexually transmitted infections] during pregnancy, multiple partners, a new partner, partner with STIs) or who live in a community with a high prevalence of syphilis, CDC recommends repeat testing early in the 3rd trimester (between 28 and 32 weeks) and again at delivery.

The CDC recommendation for syphilis screening serologically at the 1st prenatal care visit is mandated by the majority of US states (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6747684/). Nevertheless, in a CDC study of about 1300 cases of congenital syphilis reported nationwide in 2018, "missed opportunities" for prevention of congenital syphilis occurred, which varied by region (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6922a1.htm?s_cid=mm6922a1_e&deliveryName=USCDC_921-DM29813#contribAff). Racial/ethnic disparities existed within the highest morbidity regions: In the South, the most commonly missed prevention opportunity among white mothers of infants with congenital syphilis was lack of timely prenatal care (31.6%), whereas among black and Hispanic mothers, lack of adequate maternal treatment (37.0%) was the commonest. These differences in the missed prevention opportunities require strategies that are tailored to local situations. - Mod.ML
