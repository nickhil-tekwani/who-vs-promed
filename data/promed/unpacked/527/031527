Probe into India hepatitis deaths
---------------------------------
Health authorities in India have begun investigations into a number of
deaths caused by hepatitis B in the western state of Gujarat. A total of 25
people have died of the disease in the past 2 weeks in Sabarkantha
district. An official said early investigations pointed to the prevalence
of a "mutant virus" in affected patients.

Hepatitis B virus is transmitted through contact with the bodily fluids of
an infected person. The virus can be transmitted via unprotected sex or
sharing of contaminated needles. Pregnant mothers also tend to pass it on
to their babies.

Sabarkantha district official M Thennarasan told the BBC that another 26
people had been admitted to a local hospital with symptoms of hepatitis B.
Women and children have been among the dead. "We have had teams from Delhi
and the state who are investigating the cause of the spread of the
disease," he said. "Preliminary investigations show the presence of a
mutant virus in patients. But as of now we have no idea why hepatitis B has
spread in a number of adjoining areas."

Mr Thennarasan said there was "no pattern" in the class and work profile of
the patients, and that there was no information as to whether they had
taken similar injections recently. The virus can cause fever, fatigue,
muscle or joint pain, loss of appetite, nausea, and vomiting.

Chronic carriers have an increased risk of developing liver disease such as
cirrhosis or liver cancer, because the hepatitis B virus steadily attacks
the liver.

More deaths reported in Modasa
------------------------------
The total number of patients affected by hepatitis B virus now stands at
108. Even as Modasa continues to be in the grip of the "mutated" hepatitis
B virus (HBV), 7 more deaths and 23 new cases were reported in Sabarkantha
district on Friday [20 Feb 2009]. The deaths, the largest number in a
single day so far, has taken the total death toll in the district to 34 and
the total number of people affected by the virus to 108, since the 1st case
was reported on 6 Feb 2009.

An expert team from the BJ Medical College in Ahmedabad, along with
Ahmedabad Civil Hospital superintendent M M Anchalia, and health
commissioner Amarjit Singh, reached Modasa on Friday to reinvestigate some
of the suspected cases. On Saturday [21 Feb 2009], a team from the National
Institute of Communicable Diseases (NICD), Delhi will revisit Modasa and
stay there for 10 days to carry out detailed investigations. Of the 7
deaths reported on Friday, 5 are from Modasa, while one each are from
Meghraj and Bayar. The new cases of HBV have been reported from Modasa,
Meghraj, Idar, Himmatnagar and Bayar. So far only one case has been
reported from neighbouring Banaskantha. Sabarkantha chief district health
officer HS Patel said: "The 2 teams are revisiting Modasa to carry out
investigations to guide us on the line of action to be adopted."

Initially, the outbreak, which started due to the use of infected needles
and syringes, was suspected to be that of hepatitis D, which has so far not
been reported in the country. But expert teams from Lucknow, Mumbai, NICD,
Delhi and the National Institute of Virology, Pune (NIV) had negated that
possibility. On Thursday though, the NICD team confirmed one positive case
of hepatitis D. State health minister Jay Narayan Vyas said they have now
deployed 4 additional ambulances at Modasa so that patients can be quickly
shifted to the Ahmedabad Civil Hospital.

Reused syringes to blame for hepatitis outbreak in Gujarat
----------------------------------------------------------
In a startling revelation, officials investigating the outbreak of
hepatitis B virus infections in Sabarkantha, Gujarat, have found that one
out of 7 private doctors from Dhansura, booked for medical negligence, had
re-used syringes while treating patients. The disease on Friday [20 Feb
2009] claimed 3 more lives taking the official toll to 32. Reports reaching
Modasa said 23 patients were admitted to hospitals on Friday increasing the
number of such patients to 108.

On Friday, 5 of the 7 doctors booked were arrested. Officials also
confirmed the spread of hepatitis B virus infections to Malpur, Bayad and
Idar talukas (blocks) of Sabarkantha district. A truck driver from Modasa,
Bandi, lost his 13 year old son to hepatitis B virus infection at Ahmedabad
Civil Hospital. His wife died on 10 Feb 2009. Students staying in the
Sabarkantha government engineering college hostel on Friday vacated their
rooms and left for home. Officials of the food and drugs department also
raided pharmacies and chemists shops to find out if they were selling
expired drugs and reused surgical accessories.

[This number of people affected by this outbreak has risen to 108 and the
death toll to 34. The cause has been attributed progressively to hepatitis
D virus infection (subsequently discounted), hepatitis B virus infection,
and the diagnosis of last resort "mutant virus". The alternative
explanation now advanced is spread of bloodborne infection by bad medical
practice [reuse of disposable syringes] involving at least 5 practitioners
in the district. In view of the large number of hospitalized patients and
the high death toll, it is unlikely that this is the final verdict. Further
information is awaited. - Mod.CP
