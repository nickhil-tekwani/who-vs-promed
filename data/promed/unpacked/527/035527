From: Paul Ettestad <paule@DOH.STATE.NM.US>

With regard to Dr. Calisher's comment that "veterinarians do not have human
health as their prime interest", I think he totally ignores the vital role
that state and local public health veterinarians have in bridging the gap
between veterinary and human health. This role has been deemed important
enough that the United States Council of State and Territorial
Epidemiologists made a position statement at their annual meeting this year
recommending that every state health department establish a position for a
public health veterinarian. Currently 32 of 50 states in the USA employ
public health veterinarians.
In New Mexico I serve in that capacity with the Infectious Disease Unit of
the Office of Epidemiology. Our unit also consists of 3 physicians and 3
nurses. On any given day I will find myself as part of a team working on
outbreaks of pertussis, hepatitis A, or hantavirus or plague cases. I get
calls from and consult on issues from both physicians and veterinarians
around the state. Having been an Epidemic Intelligence Service Officer with
CDC (as many other public health veterinarians have also done) I have many
connections with that agency and consult with them frequently on suspect
cases. Our state veterinary diagnostic lab is in the same building as our
state laboratory division and office of the medical investigator. All
samples from veterinarians, physicians and hospital labs are run in the
same microbiology and virology labs and the results of all of them are
reviewed by the infectious disease unit. Microbiological isolates from
both animals and humans are routinely run through PFGE and compared. This
centralized system was a great help in 1993 in initially recognizing the
outbreak of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in the Four Corners area.
I think all state public health veterinarians work hard at establishing
interagency liaisons and partnerships with agricultural agencies, wildlife
agencies, and veterinary associations so that when unusual situations come
up they will know that they can call the state health department for
consultation. I would definitely discourage our veterinarians and
physicians from first discussing their suspicions and suspect cases on
ProMED-mail.

[Okay, so I got carried away. Having worked with Paul, I know him to be
pleasant, competent, and, in this case also, correct. Were I a
veterinarian or physician I wouldn't make a first report to ProMED-mail
either. I do not at all "ignore the vital role that state and local public
health veterinarians have in bridging the gap between veterinary and human
health." I was trying to emphasize that role. That the United States
Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists has, just this year,
recommended that every state health department establish a position for a
public health veterinarian pretty well emphasizes what I was saying. If
there now are only 32 of 50 states in the USA who employ public health
veterinarians, The USA has a grade of 64 (%). That's a good start but the
percentage not being 100 indicates, at least to me, that there is only
tepid enthusiasm (and understanding) for such an important link. As for
Paul having been an Epidemic Intelligence Service Officer with CDC (as have
many other public health veterinarians), I can recall the day when there
were none. This is progress. Originally, I had agreed with the statement
"As for the suggestion that veterinarians be more aware of the vital role
they play in protecting the public health." I was speaking at the level of
private practice veterinarians. I know full well of people such as Paul,
Tom Walton at USDA, and many, many others who know what's what. Read on
for more comments. - Mod.CHC

Interesting commentary. Thank you for the summary. You may find it
reassuring that several of your synopses of the WNV situation have been
forwarded to equine clinical veterinary newsgroups (where the rubber meets
the road, so to speak).

As far as criticism concerning the absence of sustained communication
between veterinarians and physicians, I couldn't have said it better.
Thanks, Charlie.
