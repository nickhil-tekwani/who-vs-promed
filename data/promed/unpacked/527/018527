A 25-year-old woman from Qena became the 39th bird flu fatality in
Egypt, the Ministry of Health reported on Saturday [1 Jan 2011]. The
woman died on 29 Dec 2010.

A 27-year-old man in the Ismailia governorate has tested positive for
bird flu. He is currently receiving treatment at a hospital in
Ismailia and is in stable condition, according to Ministry of Health
Spokesperson Abdel Rahman Shahin. [These cases have been described
previously in the Avian influenza virus thread; see: Avian influenza,
human: Egypt, 117 & 118th cases & list 20110102.0019].

So far, there have been 188 cases of bird flu since the disease 1st
appeared in Egypt in 2006. Of the 188 bird flu cases, 39 have ended in death.

On the other hand, 1272 cases of swine flu [influenza A/(H1N1) 2009
virus infection] -- causing 56 deaths -- have been reported in Egypt
ever since the disease began re-emerging in October 2010, according
to the Ministry of Health's latest press statement. The rate is
expected to go down in the coming months.

"80 percent of those who [have] passed away as a result of swine flu
[also] had chronic diseases -- [such as] asthma, liver and kidney
diseases -- [or were] pregnant," said Deputy Minister of Health for
Precautionary Measures Nasr El-Sayed.

El-Sayed explained that swine flu [influenza A/H1N1 2009] [had been]
expected to emerge due to the winter season and that the cases would
decrease starting mid-January [2011]. He noted that the number of
people afflicted with swine flu in 2010 was substantially lower than
in 2009, when the number of swine flu cases reached 10 000.

He added that, because the number of swine flu incidences is
currently much lower than in previous years, no extra precautionary
measures will be taken in schools -- such as temporarily shutting
down classes, or entire schools themselves -- as was practiced in
2009 when the H1N1 virus outbreak began.

"This year [2011], children account for 13 percent of those who have
swine flu, and the elderly account for less than 2 percent," El-Sayed
stated. "However, the majority of [swine flu] cases are among young
adults between the ages of 17 and 35."

Tamiflu, an antiviral drug that slows the spread of influenza, is
available at all hospitals, emergency rooms, and pharmacies for LE 70
[USD 12.00] per bottle.

[The relative risk for humans of influenza virus infection in Egypt
provided by these figures is instructive: 39 deaths over 5 years in
the case of avian A/(H5N1) virus infection compared with 56 deaths in
less than 4 months in the case of (swine) influenza A/(H1N1) virus infection.
