In our department, we treated a 42-year-old woman tourist who returned from
her holiday in Istanbul in Turkey. She was living in Turkey during January
until the beginning of February 2005 in an Istanbul hotel. There, she
consumed milk in her coffee and sheep milk cheeses, probably both
un-pasteurized, on Istanbul streets. The patient developed fatigue,
headache, malaise, arthralgias, myalgias and fever beginning in April 2005.
The patient was treated with a variety of antimicrobial agents in different
medical facilities without therapeutic effect until our department
diagnosed acute brucellosis (_B.abortus_) in combination with the
extraintestinal form of yersiniosis (_Y. enterocolitica_).
These diagnoses were made by laboratory serological examinations where
antibodies against brucellosis (in several blood samples) were in the 1000s
and antibodies, including antigen O:9, against _Y. enterocolitica_ were
also found.
We used the combination of 2 antibiotics for her treatment, and the patient
is now healthy. The antibody titers have also decreased after treatment.

[ProMED would like to thank Dr. Strakrle for this firsthand report of
imported brucellosis. Whether the tourist had a co-infection with
yersiniosis, however, is unclear.
The serodiagnosis of acute or recent infections with _Brucella abortus_ and
_Yersinia enterocolitica_ O:9 together is problematic because many of the
commonly used serological tests demonstrate cross-reactivity (1, 2), both
in animals and humans. It appears that the serological titers against _B.
abortus_ were higher in this case, and since neither pathogen was
apparently isolated, the antibody test for _Y. enterocolitica_ O:9 is
likely to be a cross-reaction.
This cross-reactivity is caused by an epitope (A) on the smooth-type
lipopolysaccharide (S-LPS). Although a variety of Gram negative bacilli may
contain this epitope, only _Y. enterocolitica_ O:9 is a significant cause
of cross-reaction (3).
The exact serological tests were not given, however, and some serologies
can distinguish the 2 pathogens. As examples, a Western Blot assay to assay
antibody against the outer membrane protein of _Brucella_ (4) and using
monoclonal antibodies directed against different S-LPS epitopes (5) can
identify _Brucella_, and a _Yersinia_ outer protein assay (6) can identify
_Yersinia_ O:9.
