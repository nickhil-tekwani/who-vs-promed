[2] Interim Treatment Guidance for Central Nervous System (CNS) and/or Parameningeal Infections Associated with Injection of Potentially Contaminated Steroid Products
Date: Mon 15 Oct 2012

These recommendations are based upon growing evidence that _Exserohilum rostratum_ (a brown-black mold) is the predominant pathogen in this outbreak and expert opinion and published literature indicating that voriconazole may be effective in treating infections due to brown-black molds, as well as infections due to Aspergillus species. Recommendations are also based on considerations related to the anatomic site of infection and pharmacokinetics of antifungal agents. CDC continues to consult with national experts on treatment options for fungal CNS and/or parameningeal infections in patients associated with this cluster.

This is interim guidance for treatment of adult patients with CNS and/or parameningeal infections associated with injections of potentially contaminated steroid products from the New England Compounding Center. Interim guidance may change as new information becomes available.

-Consult an infectious disease physician to assist with diagnosis, management, and follow-up, which may be complex and prolonged.
-Initiate empiric antifungal therapy after collecting cerebrospinal fluid for culture using the following regimen in addition to routine empiric treatment protocols to cover for potential bacterial pathogens until the etiology of the patient's CNS and/or parameningeal infection has been identified: voriconazole, preferably at a dose of 6 mg/kg every 12 hours.
-Voriconazole should be continued at a dose of 6 mg/kg every 12 hours, whenever possible, for the duration of treatment. This dose is recommended because ensuring adequate penetration of voriconazole into the CNS is critical.
-Dose adjustments may be needed for certain patients, including (but not necessarily limited to): children, patients less than 40 kg, and patients with hepatic impairment. Oral voriconazole should be taken at least one hour before or after a meal. Consult an infectious diseases physician and refer to the manufacturer's instructions.
-Regular monitoring of serum voriconazole concentrations (e.g., at a weekly interval) is recommended, aiming for trough levels of 2-5 microg/mL.
-Patients with more severe disease should be started on voriconazole IV.
-Patients with mild disease may be started on oral voriconazole at the provider's discretion. The above target serum levels of voriconazole are readily achievable using the oral form but may require a slightly higher dose and make take longer to achieve if unforeseen problems with gastro-intestinal intolerance or poor absorption are encountered.
-If the provider wants to transition patients initially started on IV voriconazole therapy to oral therapy, this should be done only after a patient is clinically stable or improving, as long as no contraindications to oral therapy exist.
-Providers and patients should be aware of and monitor for potential adverse effects of voriconazole, including (but not limited to) hepatic toxicity and neurotoxicity.
-Providers should carefully consider and manage the potential for voriconazole drug interactions in all patients.
-Providers should consider giving liposomal amphotericin B in addition to voriconazole to patients who present with severe disease and patients started initially on voriconazole monotherapy who do not improve or who experience clinical deterioration.
-When used, liposomal amphotericin B should preferably be given at a dose of 7.5 mg/kg IV daily (higher than standard dose). The liposomal preparation of amphotericin B is preferred over other lipid formulations because of better CNS penetration. If nephrotoxicity is a potential concern, particularly in older patients, the dose may be decreased to 5 mg/kg IV daily. Administration of 1L normal saline prior to infusion may be considered to minimize risk of nephrotoxicity. Providers and patients should be aware of and monitor for potential adverse effects of amphotericin B.
-Avoid routine use of intrathecal amphotericin B, either the deoxycholate or the lipid formulations, due to limited data on its use and associated toxicities.
-There is currently no clear evidence for the use of adjuvant steroid therapy.
-Adequate duration of antifungal treatment is unknown, but patients likely will require prolonged therapy tailored by the clinical response to treatment. Individual management decisions, including choice of long-term antifungal regimen, should be made in consultation with infectious diseases physicians experienced in the treatment of fungal infections. Although the adequate duration of therapy is unknown and will likely vary substantially depending upon individual patient circumstances, a minimum of 3 months of antifungal treatment should be considered. Treatment will likely need to continue for longer than 3 months in patients with more severe disease, bone infection, underlying immunosuppression, etc. Clinicians should be vigilant for potential relapse of infection after completion of therapy.
-Consideration should be given to obtaining spine imaging studies in patients in whom vertebral osteomyelitis/discitis or epidural abscess are concerns. These complications will prolong the duration of therapy.
-At this time, CDC does not recommend empiric antifungal therapy for symptomatic patients who have normal cerebrospinal fluid laboratory examination. These patients should be closely monitored and re-evaluated for progression of symptoms. Should the patient have progression of symptoms, a lumbar puncture should be repeated immediately, using a different site than was used for the epidural injection when possible.

[3] Interim Treatment Options for Septic Arthritis Associated With Injection of Potentially Contaminated Steroid Products
Date: Mon 15 Oct 2012
Source: CDC [edited]
http://www.cdc.gov/hai/outbreaks/clinicians/interim_treatment_options_septic_arthritis.html


The following recommendations are based upon growing evidence that _Exserohilum rostratum_ (a brown-black mold) is the predominant pathogen in this outbreak and expert opinion and published literature indicating that voriconazole may be effective in treating infections due to brown-black molds as well as infections due to _Aspergillus_ species. Recommendations are also based on considerations related to the anatomic site of infection and pharmacokinetics of antifungal agents. CDC continues to consult with national experts on treatment options for fungal arthritis in patients associated with this cluster.

This is interim guidance for treatment of adult patients with septic arthritis associated with intra-articular injections with potentially contaminated steroid products from the New England Compounding Center. Interim guidance may change as new information becomes available.

-Consult an infectious diseases physician to assist with diagnosis, management, and follow-up, which may be complex and prolonged.
-Thorough diagnostic evaluation is essential, and should include collection of synovial fluid and/or synovial tissue, prior to initiation of treatment. Samples should be sent for fungal culture, molecular testing, and histopathological examination, in addition to the standard tests for bacterial infection and crystal-induced disease.
-Routine empiric antibacterial therapy should be used according to the judgment of the physician while awaiting results of the diagnostic studies.
-In clinically stable patients, at the discretion of the provider, it may be reasonable to wait 48-72 hours before initiating empiric antifungal therapy to allow time for identification of alternative diagnoses (e.g., bacterial arthritis, crystal-induced arthritis, etc.).
-When empiric antifungal therapy is initiated, the following regimen is suggested until the etiology of the patient's septic arthritis has been identified: Voriconazole, beginning with a loading dose of 6 mg/kg every 12 hours for 2 doses, followed by 4 mg/kg every 12 hours for the duration of treatment.
-Dose adjustments may be needed for certain patients, including (but not necessarily limited to): children, patients under 40 kg [88 lbs.], and patients with hepatic impairment. Oral voriconazole should be taken at least one hour before or after a meal. Consult an infectious diseases physician and refer to the manufacturer's instructions.
-Regular monitoring of serum voriconazole concentrations (e.g., at a weekly interval) is recommended, aiming for trough levels of 2-5 microg/mL.
-Patients with more severe joint infection and/or clinical instability should be started on voriconazole IV. The above target serum levels of voriconazole are readily achievable using the oral form but may require a slightly higher dose and may take longer to achieve if unforeseen problems with gastro-intestinal intolerance or poor absorption are encountered.
-Patients with mild joint infection may be started on oral voriconazole at the provider's discretion.
-Patients initially started on IV voriconazole therapy may be transitioned to oral therapy after they are clinically stable or improving, as long as no contraindications to oral therapy exist.
-Providers and patients should be aware of and monitor for potential adverse effects of voriconazole, including (but not limited to) hepatic toxicity and neurotoxicity.
-Providers should carefully consider and manage the potential for voriconazole drug interactions in all patients.
-A lipid formulation of amphotericin B at a dose of 5 mg/kg IV daily should be considered in addition to voriconazole in patients with severe joint infection and/or clinical instability. Administration of 1L normal saline prior to infusion may be considered to minimize risk of nephrotoxicity. Providers and patients should be aware of and monitor for potential adverse effects of amphotericin B formulations.
-Alternate therapies to consider for patients who are unable to tolerate treatment with voriconazole include lipid formulations of amphotericin B, posaconazole and itraconazole. Therapeutic drug monitoring should be performed for patients treated with posaconazole or itraconazole. Consultation with an infectious diseases physician should be sought regarding dosages and monitoring of these agents. Fluconazole should NOT be used.
-Arthroscopy with joint lavage and/or debridement should be considered in consultation with an orthopedic surgeon.
-Consideration should be given to obtaining joint imaging studies in patients for whom osteomyelitis is a concern. Osteomyelitis will prolong the duration of treatment.
-Adequate duration of antifungal treatment is unknown, but it is likely that patients will require prolonged therapy (e.g., months), tailored by the clinical response to treatment. Individual management decisions, including choice of long-term antifungal regimen, should be made in consultation with infectious diseases physicians experienced in the treatment of fungal infections. Although the adequate duration of therapy is unknown and will likely vary substantially depending upon individual patient circumstances, a minimum of 3 months of antifungal treatment should be considered. Treatment may need to continue for longer than 3 months in patients with more severe disease, bone infection, underlying immunosuppression, etc. Clinicians should be vigilant for potential relapse of infection after completion of therapy.
