As local and state health officials investigate reports of salmonellosis contracted at the Delaney House [in Holyoke, Massachusetts], one of the restaurant owners apologizes to its patrons and emphasizes that they're dealing with the outbreak.

On Tue 18 Nov 2014, the Delaney House co-owner said the restaurant received a call from a patron stating that they were experiencing symptoms of salmonellosis, which include abdominal pain, diarrhea and fever. "Immediately after that call, we started an investigation," he said in a phone interview on Wed 10 Dec 2014. He said he alerted the Massachusetts Department of Public Health and Holyoke Health Department.

During the investigation, he learned of approximately 10 cases of salmonellosis that occurred between Tue 11 Nov 2014 and Sat 15 Nov 2014. While the cause of the outbreak has not been determined, he believes this is no longer an issue. "There has not been any case reported since 15 Nov 2014" he said. "Whatever came through the building was eliminated at that point and has not surfaced again."

The co-owner said state and local officials have inspected the facility and "found it compliant and safe."

State officials say 19 cases of salmonellosis were confirmed with additional cases suspected and 6 employees of Delaney House in Holyoke tested positive.

[The scope of this restaurant-associated outbreak of salmonellosis has yet to be determined as there appear to be additional cases from the suspect time period being evaluated. The serotype of _S. enterica_ has not been stated. Salmonellosis can be spread by food that may be obtained from naturally infected animals such as cattle and fowl but can also be acquired from food that is contaminated later in the farm to table pathway such as from fish or vegetables. Further information would be appreciated. - Mod.LL
