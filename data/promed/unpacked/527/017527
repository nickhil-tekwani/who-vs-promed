NIV team detects Andhra Pradesh's mysterious fever, preliminary probe
shows mosquito-transmitted chikungunya virus behind it
------------------------------------------------------
The preliminary investigations into the mysterious fever that wreaked
havoc in at least 5 districts of Andhra Pradesh in January this year
[2006] have pointed towards a mosquito-transmitted virus as the cause
behind it. This arthropod-borne virus -- chikungunya virus -- was
found to be behind the mysterious fever by a team of scientists from
the National Institute of Virology (NIV) here.
The team that visited the districts and collected the samples has
yet to finalize its report, but investigations have all pointed
towards chikungunya virus. They will soon be sending a detailed
report to the Union Ministry of Health.
Chikungunya virus is transmitted by the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito, the
same species of mosquito that [transmits] dengue. High fever, chills,
severe headache followed by acute joint and muscle pain are the
symptoms of the infection. Fever persists for 3 days and pain for 7
days or more, depending upon the resistance of the patient.
Chikungunya virus is highly infectious and disabling. The name comes
from Swahili and means "that which bends up," a reference to the
positions that victims take to relieve the joint pain. Chikungunya is
responsible for extensive _Aedes aegypti_-transmitted urban disease
in Africa and is also the cause of epidemics in Asia. The crippling
arthralgia and frequent arthritis that accompany the fever and other
systemic symptoms are clinically distinguishing.

Since the disease is all over the Indian Ocean now -- see ref. below -- it
would not be surprising to find it there, carried by travelers incubating the
disease. - Mod.JW]
[Andhra Pradesh is a state in southeastern India, bounded by
Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh and Orissa in the north, the Bay of Bengal
