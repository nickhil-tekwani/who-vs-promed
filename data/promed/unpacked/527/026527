Florida Man Hospitalized for Anthrax
----------------------------------------------
The unidentified, 63-year-old Lantana, Fla., man checked into a Lake Worth
hospital on Tuesday after a visit to North Carolina and was reported to be
gravely ill. Dr. Larry Bush, an infectious-disease specialist at JFK
Memorial Hospital in Fort Worth, said the man was currently on a
ventilator. "He's critically ill. Hopefully he'll respond to treatment,"
Bush said.
"We will develop a very intense investigation of this case," Koplan said in
an interview. "We are in a period of heightened risk and concern in this
country. It's our responsibility to make sure people know what is going on
and we control it as quickly as possible." Koplin said CDC investigators
had been dispatched to both Florida and North Carolina. The FBI is also
investigating. "We will be checking on a day-by-day basis where he was,
what he did, where he stayed, and looking for risks," Koplan said.
But the CDC already has canvassed hospitals and health departments in those
states and found no one else with similar symptoms, the CDC chief said.
Koplan said the patient has no digestive symptoms that would indicate the
anthrax came from drinking contaminated water, and no skin symptoms from
direct contact with the germ. But as for the possibility that he got
anthrax from deliberately contaminated air, Koplan said: "We are
aggressively investigating this case."
Fears that terrorists may have been planning an airborne chemical or
biological attack were raised last month when it learned that a group of
Middle Eastern men -- including one of the hijackers in the attack on the
World Trade Center -- had been asking a lot of questions about a
crop-duster at an airfield in Belle Glade, which is about 40 miles inland
from Lantana. Because of those fears, the government grounded all
crop-dusters across the country for a few days after the 11 Sep 2000
terrorist attacks.
Koplin said the disease may actually be more common but goes undetected.
The latest case may have come to health officials' attention only because
of heightened concern about its use as a possible weapon of mass
destruction. "What might have been tossed off as an undetermined bacterium
was sent on to a state lab, where people recently received training in
detecting anthrax," he said. "It is a possible answer, which is an improved
detection system."

was those at the Fort Worth hospital who diagnosed this case. I apologize
for the mistake. - Mod.MHJ
