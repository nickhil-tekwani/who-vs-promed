Applicable Law: The IHR [International Health Regulations are
irrelevant here. The applicable law is international trade law, more
specifically the Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and
Phytosanitary Measures (SPS Agreement) of the WTO. (I am
assuming that trade in dogs and cats falls under the WTO regime,
which is something that I have not verified.)
Under the SPS Agreement, the EU [European Union has the right
to impose trade-restricting measures to protect animal health (Art.
2.1). Such trade-restricting measures must, however, satisfy (1)
science-based criteria, and (2) trade-related disciplines.
(1) Science-Based Criteria. The EU measure in question must be
"based on scientific principles and . . . not maintained without
sufficient scientific evidence," except in situations where the
scientific evidence is uncertain (Art. 2.2.). If a measure conforms
to relevant international standards, then it is presumed to be based
on scientific principles and scientific evidence (Art. 3). I would
imagine there are not relevant scientific principles in this case from
the OIE or any other international organization. Critical to
sustaining a measure's scientific basis is the performance of a risk
assessment (Art. 5). The Banks posting suggests that the EU has
not conducted a risk assessment and that the measure in question
lacks scientific legitimacy. Under Article 5.7, a measure may be
maintained where the scientific evidence is uncertain under the
"precautionary principle."
(2) Trade-Related Disciplines. Even if the EU measure was
scientifically justified, it would still have to satisfy the trade-related
disciplines of the SPS Agreement, the most important of which is
the "necessary" requirement in Article 5.6: "Members shall ensure
that such measures are not more trade-restrictive than required to
achieve their appropriate level of sanitary or phytosanitary
protection, taking into account technical and economic feasibility."
The Banks posting opens up the issue whether the EU's ban is the
least trade-restrictive measure that was available to the EU,
perhaps signaling a violation of this trade-related discipline.
There is another issue the Banks posting raises, which is
consultation. Annex B.5 of the SPS Agreement states that
Members shall provide other affected Members with notice of a
proposed SPS measure, including time for those affected
Members to make comments in writing about proposal. I gather
from the Banks posting that the EU probably did not follow this
notification rule in connection with its ban.
