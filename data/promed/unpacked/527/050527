From 1 Jan 2021-11 Mar 2021, at least 21 confirmed cases of bubonic plague have been confirmed in Madagascar; 8 of these cases were reported since 1 Mar 2021 in Amoron'i Mania (Ambositra and Manandriana). Since the start of the year [2021], 37 suspected cases have been reported, affecting multiple regions, including Alaotra-Mangoro, Analamanga, Haute Matsiatra, and Itasy. Roughly 9 deaths have been associated with this disease activity. This represents the most complete data available as of 12 Mar 2021.

Plague is endemic to Madagascar, where 200-700 cases are reported each year, primarily the bubonic form. The risk of plague spreading to humans is elevated in Madagascar, where the fleas that transmit the disease are highly resistant to insecticide. The poor state of Madagascar's public health system and limited access to healthcare in rural areas may also facilitate the spread of the disease.

Plague is caused by a bacterium that is usually transmitted through the bite of an infected flea. However, an infection can also occur through direct contact with tissues or fluids from infected animals, such as a scratch or bite. Bubonic plague occurs when the bacteria infect a person's lymph nodes. This form of plague is not easily transmissible from person to person. However, when the bacteria spread through the bloodstream to the lungs, pneumonic plague can transmit directly from person to person via respiratory droplets containing the plague bacteria. Symptoms of plague generally develop 1-7 days after exposure. All forms of plague cause nondescript symptoms, such as fever, chills, and extreme weakness. Symptoms of bubonic plague also include swollen, tender, and painful lymph nodes and symptoms of pneumonic plague include pneumonia with shortness of breath, chest pain, and cough.

Consult a travel medicine provider before departure regarding plague vaccination. Practice basic health precautions. Avoid flea bites. Seek medical attention if symptoms develop within a week of being in affected areas.

[Plague infections in Madagascar have been relatively quiet since the dramatic outbreak in 2017.

The following paragraph is from Chanteau S, Ratsifasoamanana L, Rasoamanana B, et al.: Plague, a reemerging disease in Madagascar. Emerg Infect Dis. 1998; 4(1): 101-4; PMID: 9452403; available at http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/4/1/98-0114_article.htm:

"Human cases of plague, which had virtually disappeared in Madagascar after the 1930s, reappeared in 1990 with more than 200 confirmed or presumptive cases reported each year since. In the port of Mahajanga, plague has been reintroduced, and epidemics occur every year. In Antananarivo, the capital, the number of new cases has increased, and many rodents are infected with Yersinia pestis. Despite surveillance for the sensitivity of Y. pestis and fleas to drugs and insecticides and control measures to prevent the spread of sporadic cases, the elimination of plague has been difficult because the host and reservoir of the bacillus, Rattus rattus, is both a domestic and a sylvatic rat."

Fatalities related to plague usually are caused by spread of the organism from the bubo (the very painful infected lymph node that drains the area where the flea bite occurred) to the bloodstream. The bacteremia can cause a coagulopathy, producing the purpura seen in the "black plague," and also may spread to the lungs causing a hemorrhagic pneumonia. It is the pneumonia that can facilitate person-to-person transmission.

Madagascar was the location of the isolation of multi-antimicrobial resistant _Yersinia pestis_ in 1995 (Galimand M, Guiyoule A, Gerbaud G, et al.: Multidrug resistance in _Yersinia pestis_ mediated by a transferable plasmid. N Engl J Med. 1997; 337(10): 677-80, PMID: 9278464; http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199709043371004). The strain was resistant to chloramphenicol, streptomycin, and tetracycline but sensitive to fluoroquinolones and trimethoprim as well as other aminoglycosides. This was an ominous observation; however, it is not clear whether this naturally occurring strain has persisted or spread. - Mod.LL
