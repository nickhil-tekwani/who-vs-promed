[The Peloponnese region, Greece, has not witnessed bluetongue virus (BTV) activity for about 10 years. The speedy and wide spread of the recently penetrated BTV-4 strain by infected culicoides into continental Greece should not surprise since the susceptible sheep population is not vaccinated. Goats and cattle are known to be rarely, if at all, clinically affected by this serotype.

Since the start of this epizootic, reportedly on 29 May 2014, Greece reported to the OIE 38 outbreaks; see their locations on an interactive map at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=15348. - Mod.AS]
