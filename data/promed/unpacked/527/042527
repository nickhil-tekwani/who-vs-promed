We are pleased to announce that the 2nd edition of Infectious Disease Manual: Infectious Diseases of Concern to Captive and Free Ranging Animals in North America has been published on the AAZV (American Association of Zoo Veterinarians) website (http://www.aazv.org/?page=IDM2013)

The individual contributions were essential and the process could not have completed without the expertise, attention to detail, and collaboration from each of our 126 authors and 294 reviewers. We hope that readers find the manual to be a useful resource. Additionally, using funding from a small grant, we also are able to distribute flash drives with the Infectious Disease Manual to state and regional veterinary officials.

In an ongoing international effort, we have dove-tailed this edition with a similar effort commenced previously by our European colleagues. In 2015, we again will begin revision so that we can jointly publish our 3rd edition with their 5th in 2016!

The following is the citation for using the Infectious Disease Manual as inclusion in literature citations or publications:
Author. Chapter title. In: Gamble, KC, and MM Clancy (eds). Infectious Diseases of Concern to Captive and Free Ranging Animals in North America, 2nd ed. 2013. Infectious Disease Committee, American Association of Zoo Veterinarians, Yulee, Florida. 1098 pp. http://www.aazv.org/?page=IDM2013.

For now, we again offer our thanks to our collaborators, and please do let us know if you have questions or new diseases for future inclusion in this manual.
