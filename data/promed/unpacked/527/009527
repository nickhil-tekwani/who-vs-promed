[Readers may have noticed that starting yesterday [28 Sep 2014], I have given up changing "Ebola" and "Ebola virus" to the technically correct EVD and ebolavirus, because media reports ignore the distinction, and it just takes too long to do, even using Search & Replace (because of all the "-ebola-" in URLs that have to be exempted), resulting in me filing late and keeping ProMED copy-eds. on duty past the end of their late shift. - Mod.JW]

[1] ECOWAS 7 point communique
Date: 28 Sep 2014

The ECOWAS Assembly of Ministers of Health has issued a 7-point communique developed by the coordinating ministerial group for the implementation of the operational plan on the Ebola virus disease.

The communique, which was read by Mrs Olubunmi Ojo, Director, Disease Surveillance/International Health Regulations, called for immediate deployment of West Africa Health Organisation delegations to affected countries and the organisation of high level missions to neighbouring nations.

It called for organsiation of multi-sectoral missions to Cote d'Ivoire and Senegal to discuss immediate implementation of humanitarian, economic and health corridors in accordance with rules adopted by the Technical Monitoring and Surveillance Group.

It called for preparation and dissemination of harmonised sensitisation and information messages targeting [populations] in an effort to stop the spread of the epidemic.

The communique also requested the ECOWAS Commission for the mobilisation of the armed and security forces to strengthen regional response against the Ebola virus epidemic and provide, among other things, medical personnel and logistics as well as mobilise the support of the military engineers' regiments in setting up treatment centres.

It called for the provision of adequate financial incentives for national health personnel already on the ground and finalisation of the Ebola Regional Operation Plan and its submission to the President of the ECOWAS Commission.

Ghana's Minister of Health, Dr Kwaku Agyemang-Mensah, called for harmonisation of individual country's efforts to avoid panicking, which could thwart the community's efforts at dealing with the disease which had claimed more than 2000 lives in the region.

[2] Liberia: US troops face challenging circumstances
Date: 28 Sep 2014

http://wsj.com/articles/u-s-troops-battling-ebola-get-off-to-slow-start-in-africa-1411948064


On Sat [27 Sep 2014], a handful of troops from the US Navy's 133rd Mobile Construction Battalion led a bulldozer through thigh-high grass outside Liberia's main airport, bottles of hand sanitizer dangling from their belt loops. They had been digging a parking lot in the East African nation of Djibouti this month [September 2014] when they received a call to build the 1st of a dozen or more tent hospitals the U.S. intends to construct in this region. The soldiers started by giving the land a downward slope for water runoff -- "to keep out any unwanted reptiles," said Petty Officer Second Class Justin Holsinger. While this team levels the earth, superiors hash out the still-uncertain details of the American intervention here...

"There is no argument the disease is out in front of the response," said Ken Isaacs, vice president of programs and government relations for Samaritan's Purse, who, as an expert in humanitarian assistance, is leading. In terms of response, he added, "where we are today is where we should have been 60 to 90 days ago." Now, some of that help has arrived, partly in the form of a rare -- if not unprecedented -- U.S. effort. So far, that assistance largely involves leveling swampy grassland, unloading supplies and setting up tents.

And yet if 70 percent of Ebola patients aren't cared for in a treatment center or other setting where they can't transmit the disease to others, then the epidemic in both countries could worsen, the CDC said. On 16 Sep 2014, President Barack Obama ordered 3000 U.S. soldiers into West Africa. In a speech at the United Nations on Thu [25 Sep 2014], Mr. Obama criticized the international response thus far and said other donors -- governments and organizations -- need to step up quickly with aid.

"Right now, everybody has the best of intentions, but people are not putting in the kinds of resources that are necessary to put a stop to this epidemic," he said. More nations urgently need to contribute goods and services like health-care workers, equipment and air transport, he said. Several countries and organizations have donated money and technical assistance, from the World Bank to Cuba, which is sending 165 [now 461] doctors, nurses and other health specialists to the region. But more are needed, particularly because the health systems in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea have been overwhelmed.

Other help is beginning to arrive. On Sunday morning [28 Sep 2014], a privately contracted 747 cargo plane landed with 2016 rolls of plastic sheeting from the U.S. government, one of the materials needed to build an Ebola clinic. It would take hours to unload the plane, the crew said. Liberia's airport, built in 1942, has just 3 small forklifts. U.S. Air Force personnel will also have to repair the runway, or, for the time being, just paint it so planes don't land on parts in disrepair. "Some companies would rather go to Afghanistan than come here," said the plane's loadmaster, Felix Curtis. In the cockpit, a nervous 1st officer was wearing surgical gloves, a medical mask on his seat. He shared a pen with a Liberian, then darted to the bathroom to wash his hands: "Am I going to be OK?" he asked.

The files on most of Liberia's Ebola cases are stored in 3-ring binders on a shelf in an abandoned World War II-era chimpanzee testing lab, filled with bats. That is where the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases [USAMRIID] conducts blood tests for Ebola [for the government]. A small 3-ring binder holds all the case files from 15 Apr-12 Aug 2014. A binder twice that size holds the files from just 5 days in late September 2014. "Well," said Alec Hail, the doctor who supervises the testing, "that's remarkable."

Even with the U.S. response, the CDC fears thousands more lives may still be lost. New centers are filling up as quickly as they are built. On 21 Sep 2014, the World Health Organization opened its 2nd clinic in Monrovia, Liberia's capital. By evening, every bed was taken. "I don't think we can open them any faster," said head clinician Anne Deborah Omoruto Atai. Near the doctor's office, a fierce rainstorm was flooding part of the clinic.

Meanwhile, the embattled Liberian government is struggling to manage a response to the disease. Last week, an official at the health ministry -- the focal point for the Ebola effort -- died of Ebola. Other workers abandoned the building, which on Thu [25 Sep 2014] was being sprayed with chlorine. The next morning, the chief medical officer placed herself under 21-day quarantine, on concerns that she had been exposed. That situation has created a desperate groundswell of support for the U.S. military mission here. "We want the U.S. Army to take over this entire situation," said Sarka Weah, among a group of men watching the naval unit bulldoze the field. "Yes!" screamed the others.

The clinic will only hold 25 beds, and not for ordinary Liberians: just health workers. U.S. officials hope it will entice other countries to send their own nurses and doctors. "It's hard to know where they'll all come from," said Frank Mahoney, who heads the CDC's Ebola response in Liberia.

This month [September 2014], the U.S. Agency for International Development [USAID] helped Liberia's government convert an unused conference room in a telecommunications building into a war room. The U.S. aid agency had 12 wooden tables built and helped restore running water to the toilets and brought in filing cabinets from the U.S. Embassy, said people involved in that effort. Last Tuesday evening [23 Sep 2014], James Dorbah Jallah, the national coordinator of Liberia's Ebola Task Force, sat in the war room trying to get bottled water delivered to an Ebola clinic that had run out. "It's not possible," said the supervisor of the government's motor pool over speakerphone. "Everybody's gone home."

Ebola: an open letter to European governments
----------------------------------------------------------
Jose M Martin-Moreno, Walter Ricciardi, Vesna Bjegovic-Mikanovic, Peggy Maguire, Martin McKee, on behalf of 44 signatories

After months of inaction and neglect from the international community, the Ebola epidemic in west Africa has now spiraled utterly out of control. Today, the virus is a threat not only to the countries where the outbreak has overwhelmed the capacity of national health systems, but also to the entire world. We urge our governments to mobilise all possible resources to assist west Africa in controlling this horrific epidemic. Based on our expertise in public health and emergency response, we believe the following measures would be particularly effective... - more

[4] Senegal opens airport for EVD aid

Senegal, which closed its border to Guinea to stave off EVD last month [August 2014], said Sat [27 Sep 2014] it has now opened up a humanitarian corridor at an airport to help speed aid to stricken countries. A plane carrying workers with the UN's World Food Programme arriving from the Guinean capital Conakry landed at the designated humanitarian air corridor on a military air base near Dakar, AFP reported. Senegalese Health Minister Awa Marie Coll Seck said Dakar had reached an agreement with international aid groups and western states to use an air corridor "to send equipment, medicines, and to support human resources in order to save human lives."

Coll Seck, speaking alongside Senegalese, UN and NGO officials, told journalists the airport access was opened up "in the context of international solidarity." A Senegalese official said the corridor had been operational for 2 days but was still being set up.

At this stage, it is far from clear how long the Ebola outbreak will last or which further countries it will affect. This leads to a great deal of uncertainty in the shipping industry, which must take precautions for the current situation but anticipate that greater quarantine and preventive measures may come into force in the future. As there is no immediate prospect of the outbreak coming to an end, it is advisable to take steps now to minimise exposure to potential risks, including those set out in this article. This includes drafting appropriate charterparty and/or bill of lading clauses.

Most importantly, it is essential to keep up to date with warnings and guidance issued by port authorities, national and international authorities, and industry leaders, so that protective measures are implemented in a timely and consistent manner.

Ghana: UN mission to combat Ebola opens
----------------------------------------
29 Sep 2014: (AP) The UN mission to combat Ebola opened its headquarters on Mon 29 Sep 2014 in Ghana, where it will coordinate aid for the accelerating West African crisis...

Liberia: Despite massive promises of aid in recent weeks, many areas have grossly inadequate resources. For instance, Nimba County, one of the places Ebola has hit hardest in Liberia outside the capital, has only one ambulance, and it is often broken down, the county's medical officer, Collins Bowah, said Monday [29 Sep 2014]. Nimba natives who live in the capital of Monrovia have started a fundraiser to help out those back home...

Rains complicate delivery of Ebola supplies in West Africa
-------------------------------------------------
29 Sep 2014: (Reuters) The rainy season in West Africa is compounding difficulties in getting supplies delivered and new treatment centers built as donors rush to isolate people infected with the deadly Ebola virus and stop its rapid spread, U.S. officials said... The July to September rainy season is coming toward its end, but October is known for heavy thunderstorms that can drench the region and turn roads to mud. Eric Talbert, executive director of Emergency USA, which has opened a 22-bed Ebola treatment center in Goderich, outside the capital of Freetown in Sierra Leone, said the downpours complicate getting supplies along unpaved roads; "We are talking about dirt roads that are single track. The rains wash them out... Rains are not only going to escalate the logistical difficulties, but Ebola will spread if we cannot reach people and treat them."

Liberia's newest, largest treatment clinic already over capacity
-----------------------------------------
29 Sep 2014: (CBC News) When it opened [on 21 Sep 2014], there were 120 beds available. Within hours, the clinic was already stretched, every space available filled with the city's most frightened and seriously ill. Somehow, room was made for more patients, and currently, by adding beds and sofas where possible, staff estimate the total number is likely closer to 200. The World Health Organization funded the clinic and handed it over to Liberia's Ministry of Health and Social Welfare, while UNICEF, the World Food Programme and USAID have joined the WHO in donating supplies and support...
