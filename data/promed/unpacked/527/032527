VARICELLA, NEONATAL? (2)
========================
According to Abram S. Benenson, ed., Control of Communicable
Diseases Manual, "Neonates developing varicella between ages 5 and 10 days
or those whose mothers develop the disease 5 days prior to or within 2 days
after delivery are at increased risk of developing severe generalized
chickenpox with up to a 30% mortality rate."
