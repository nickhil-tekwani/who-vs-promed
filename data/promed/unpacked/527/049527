Indiana has recorded the 1st case of flu contracted from pigs since 2013, state health officials said. Test results Friday [29 Jun 2018] confirmed the 1st human case of H3N2 variant influenza in the United States this year [2018], according the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The Indiana resident was exposed to the virus from pigs at a county fair that has ended. A news release from the state's Department of Health and Board of Animal Health did not identify the residents or the county where the fair occurred. The release said the resident is recovering. The affected county health department was notified and is collaborating with state health officials.

"No additional details about the patient or the fair will be released at this time in order to maintain the patient's privacy," the release said.

Influenza viruses can be directly transmitted from pigs to people and from people to pigs. H3N2v is most commonly associated with contact with pigs, the release said. Influenza viruses are not transmitted by eating pork and pork products.

Symptoms include fever, cough, sore throat, body aches, fatigue, headaches and sometimes vomiting or diarrhea. Influenza antiviral drugs can treat H3N2v as well as seasonal flu illness in people.

State health officials were warning people to take precautions when they visit pig shows:

Avoid eating, drinking, using tobacco or putting anything else in your mouth while in pig barns and show arenas.
Avoid taking toys, pacifiers, cups, bottles, strollers or similar items into pig barns and show arenas.
Wash hands often with soap and running water before and after attending pig exhibits. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand rub.
Stay home if you are sick with flu-like illness.
People at high risk for serious complications from the flu should avoid pigs and should not enter swine barns. These populations include children younger than 5, pregnant women, people 65 and older and people with long-term health conditions such as asthma, diabetes or heart disease, as well as those with weakened immune systems.

State officials also warned fair exhibitors to watch pigs for signs of illness, such as loss of appetite, lethargy, fever, cough or runny nose. Exhibitors should minimize the number of people who have contact with ill swine and notify the fair veterinarian or manager that their animal might be ill. People who must come in contact with pigs that are exhibiting signs of illness should wash their hands frequently with soap and water and wear protective clothing, including gloves and masks that cover the mouth and nose.

The CDC offers additional guidance for exhibitors on its website.

According to the CDC, more than 400 cases of H3N2v influenza have been identified in people nationwide since 2011. More than 1/3rd of those cases have occurred in Indiana. The National Pork Board reported in 2017 that Indiana ranks 5th among states with the most hogs, with nearly 2 million produced.

State Health Commissioner Dr. Kris Box issued a statement:

"Seeing animals is one of the highlights of going to the fair, but it's important to remember that animals can carry diseases that can make people sick. Washing your hands after attending animal exhibits and practicing good food hygiene can help prevent illness and ensure that the fair and other events remain a healthy and fun experience."

[The CDC, USA is concerned about Influenza A/H3N2v cases for a number of reasons;
- 1st, infections with influenza viruses (including variant viruses like H3N2v) can sometimes cause severe disease, even in healthy people. This can include complications (like pneumonia), which can require hospitalization, and sometimes result in death.
- 2nd, this virus seems to spread more easily to humans from pigs than other swine influenza viruses.
-3rd, influenza viruses are always changing. It's possible the H3N2v virus could change and begin spreading easily from person to person.
- 4th, studies conducted by CDC and others have indicated that children born after 2001 (age 9 years at 2010 or younger) have little to no immunity against H3N2v viruses. Adults seem to have more immunity, perhaps because they might have been previously exposed to similar viruses in their lifetimes.

Currently, the severity of human illness associated with H3N2v resembles that of seasonal flu. Keep in mind that even seasonal influenza can be a serious disease. Sometimes seasonal influenza can lead to complications (like pneumonia). It also can lead to hospitalization and even death.

Early steps to make a vaccine against H3N2v have been taken. A pilot H3N2v vaccine was produced, and preliminary clinical studies indicated that it leads to a significant immune response https://www.cdc.gov/flu/swineflu/h3n2v-basics.htm.

Indiana was one of the 1st states to report A/Influenza H3N2v cases in 2011, with 2, 138, and 14 cases reported during 2011, 2012 and 2013, respectively https://www.cdc.gov/flu/swineflu/h3n2v-case-count.htm. - Mod.UBA
