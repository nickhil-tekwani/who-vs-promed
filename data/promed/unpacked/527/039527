After responding to a case of animal hoarding, the Maury County Animal Shelter was again in contact with a rare illness that killed 3 dogs and led to the euthanization of 2 earlier this summer [2019].

Maury County Mayor Andy Ogles confirmed that the shelter was placed on lockdown last month [September 2019] and sterilized to prevent the spread of the disease, strep equi zooepidemicus, an emerging canine pathogen thought to cause a fatal pneumonia. One animal from the hoarding case was identified with the illness and euthanized, Ogles said. "Only that animal that was already sick died," Ogles said. "No other animals were exposed."

The mayor commended the work of shelter director Jack Cooper and his staff. "We did not have an outbreak this time," Jack Cooper, the shelter's director told The Daily Herald. "We did prophylactically administer antibiotic injections to affected pets, but we didn't have any other deaths or serious illness We opened back up the next week and have been operating normally since then, with no additional disease detected."

Also known as "strep zoo," the bacterial illness is typically found in horses, but has also been reported to cause infections in cows, sheep, goats, pigs, and cats. The contagious disease is believed to be spread through the air, contact with body fluids and contaminated surfaces. That allows the illness to spread rapidly in enclosed environments such as an animal shelter, where many animals already weakened immune systems. Symptoms include coughing, nasal discharge, vomiting, and labored breathing.

This summer [2019], 2 dogs were discovered dead in a single cell. The shelter's staff quickly moved to quarantine dogs that may have been infected by the disease and began treating them with antibiotics. Another dog was found dead hours earlier, but the animal was initially thought to have died from complications caused by heartworms, Cooper previously told The Daily Herald.

Two dogs that were considered very likely to be infected with the disease were euthanized as staff worked to decontaminate the entire facility.

After the outbreak, the shelter was closed to the public for 10 days, during which no visitors were allowed to enter the facility and none were adopted. More than 90 animals were staying in the shelter at the time.

A total of 19 dogs were euthanized at a California shelter in 2017 after the same illness was identified, a report from the Stockton Record chronicles. In November 2018, at least 5 dogs died from the disease at the Weld County Humane Society in Colorado. In Kentucky, the Lexington Humane Society's main campus was also closed in 2017 following the deaths of 2 dogs from the illness. An estimated 1000-plus shelter dogs succumbed to severe hemorrhagic pneumonia caused by the illness in the Las Vegas area during 2008.

At the time of the outbreak earlier this year [2019], Cooper warned local pet owners to take precautions, as all animals taken in by the shelter are found in Maury County. "It is definitely out there somewhere," said Cooper. "Everyone should just be cautious. If your animal is sick, take them to the vet."

Euthanasia is currently down 45% at the shelter, the mayor said.

[The 1st recognized human case of _Streptococcus equi_, sub sp. _zooepidemicus_ (a Lancefield group C _Streptococcus_) was in a farmer who presumably was infected by his sheep dog. In humans, infections caused by _S. zooepidemicus_ are a rare event, resulting in meningitis, bacteraemia, acute nephritis, septic arthritis, pneumonia, and in some cases, death of the patient (Barnham et al, 1987; Efstratiou, 1997; Thorley et al, 2007; Ural et al, 2003). In the majority of these cases, consumption of unpasteurized milk or direct contact with horses was considered the most likely source of infection.

_S. zooepidemicus_ has been reported as an opportunistic pathogen associated with invasive infections in laboratory and domestic animals (Francis et al, 1993). A commensal organism in horses, it is also associated with respiratory tract infections in foals and young horses (Chanter, 1997; Downar et al, 2001) and with equine abortion (Giles et al, 1993). In cattle, _S. zooepidemicus_ has been described as an occasional cause of mastitis (Edwards et al, 1988), and in dogs is associated with respiratory conditions such as canine infectious respiratory disease and HSP (Chalker et al, 2003; Pesavento et al, 2008). It is not, however, normally associated with chronic respiratory infection in dogs. Infection is uncommon in humans (Francis et al, 1993), and _S. zooepidemicus_ accounts for less than one percent of all bacteraemias (CFSPH, 2005) but has been described as the most virulent of the Lancefield Group C streptococci that infect humans (Bradley et al, 1991). Mortality rates following infections with _S. zooepidemicus_ are twice as high as those associated with cases of _S. equisimilis_ (Bradley et al, 1991). - Mod.MHJ
