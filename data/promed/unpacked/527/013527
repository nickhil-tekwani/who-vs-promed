Infections in 19 farm workers have prompted the largest-ever mass-culling
in Kanchanaburi. About 2000 goats will be culled today at the country's
biggest goat farm, in Kanchanaburi province, to prevent the spread of the
infectious disease brucellosis, a senior Livestock Development Department
official said on 6 Sep 2005.
Samart Jaralyanon, provincial chief for livestock development, said the
culling at Mahboonkrong Dairy Goats Co was ordered by the department's
director-general. It will be the 1st time animals are culled in such large
numbers, he said. The transport of all of the farm's products, such as live
goats, dairy products and meat, were also banned under the same order.
Samart said goat dairy products already available on the market were safe
to eat, because the bacteria were killed by pasteurization. Dr Pakdi
Bhotisiri, secretary-general of the Food and Drug Administration, confirmed
that goat dairy products already on the market were not contaminated.
Samart said more than 700 goats had been killed at the farm since the
infectious bacterial disease was first discovered in Mar 2005. The farm was
declared an epidemic control zone last Thu, 1 Sep 2005. Humans can be
infected through direct contact with secretions of infected goats.
Samart said the farm also raised goats for meat, even though it was
registered as a dairy farm. He said only goats raised for meat would be
culled, because there were no reports of infection among the farm's 2500
dairy goats. The director-general of the Livestock Development Department
will inspect the farm today with an adviser to the agriculture minister.
The farm's manager also invited journalists to visit at the same time.
12 men and 7 women who worked at the farm have so far been infected with
the disease. Dr Surapong Tanthanasri-sakul, head of public health for the
province, said a special center was set up at Phra Piya Hospital to care
for those infected. He said the disease could be cured with a 6 week
regimen of antimicrobial agents.
Dr Thawat Suntrajarn, director-general of the Disease Control Department,
said it was not necessary for infected humans to be quarantined, because
there were no reports of human-to-human transmission. A special team of
doctors was sent to the farm to find out how the workers had become infected.

[Caprine brucellosis is usually caused by _B. melitensis_, which is a
significant human zoonotic disease. In 2003, ProMED-mail posted a previous
outbreak of brucellosis in humans and goats in Thailand. Of note, Laurence
Gleeson from Australia's Animal Health Laboratory commented: "This is an
important report, as _Brucella melitensis_ has not been previously reported
from Thailand, and in fact Southeast Asia is considered free from the
disease (OIE Manual of Standards, 2000).
"Although an epidemic of brucellosis due to _B. abortus_ would not be
expected in goats, especially in the absence of some concurrent abortion
outbreak in cattle, clearly a definitive identification of the causative
_Brucella sp_ is required to clarify the situation.
"If this is a true introduction of an exotic agent into Thailand, then it
was most likely introduced by animal movement from an endemic area. Goats
move into some parts of Thailand from Myanmar (a single outbreak of caprine
brucellosis was reported in 1998 and 1999; OIE 'Handistatus'), but of more
concern would be if the animals came from further west, where other serious
diseases of goats are endemic, e.g., peste des petits ruminants and goat
and sheep pox.
"As goats can also be carriers of FMD, there is potential for such animal
movement to shift strains from South Asia to South East Asia. This incident
is a marker for an important background event that hopefully will be
unravelled by the epidemiological and laboratory investigations conducted
by the Department of Livestock Development, Thailand."
Brucellosis is another zoonotic infection that can be spread not only by
direct contact with the animal carrier but also by the ingestion of
unpasteurized dairy products such as milk and cheese. The infection is also
known as undulant fever, related to the occurrence of 1-3 week febrile
periods separated by 1-3 days of afebrility. This occurs more likely with
_B. melitensis_ (acquired from goats) as compared to _B. abortus_ (cattle)
and _B. suis_ (swine).
The infection can be subclinical. Acute symptomatic brucellosis is
generally manifest with nonspecific symptoms such as fever, chills, night
sweats, anorexia, and an increased sense of ill health. The disease can be
diagnosed serologically and/or by blood culture. The organism may grow
quite slowly on primary isolation, and the clinician should make the
microbiology laboratory aware of this potential diagnosis. Localized
infection may occur. Sites for localization include the skeletal system
(1), heart valves (2) and urinary tract (3). GU brucellosis may present
identically to GU tuberculosis. Psychiatric manifestations such as
depression and anxiety are possible as late symptoms of brucellosis (4,5),
so-called chronic neurobrucellosis. It remains unclear whether active
brucella infection is present at that time. Overt CNS infection can,
however, include meningitis and encephalitis (6,7).
