China warns against possible bird flu in autumn, winter
-----------------------------------------------
China has required all localities to strengthen preventive efforts against
the possible outbreak of the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus, or
bird flu, during autumn [2004] and winter [2005], according to a circular
recently issued by the Ministry of Agriculture.
According to the circular, poultry should be immunized more strongly in key
areas and quarantined before and after butchering. "Sterilization work
should also be carefully done to remove all potential build-ups. Farms,
slaughterhouses, markets, cool-houses and transport tools should be
disinfected," it says. "Since the autumn and winter period is a key period
for birds to migrate, the bird flu is quite likely to break at any time,"
warns the circular, which cites the ongoing highly pathogenic bird flu in
some Asian countries as a threat to China. "Various localities of the
country must understand the current situation and increase their sense of
responsibility in preventing the highly pathogenic bird flu," it says.
It also requires all related authorities to substantively enhance
coordination to form a united power. "Authorities should also prepare and
improve their emergency plans and [make] ready vaccine and sterilizing
drugs," says the circular.

[The last report on an HPAI outbreak in China was received by the OIE on 6
Jul 2004. China's HPAI control policy is based mainly upon mass
preventative vaccination. It is of the utmost importance that all vaccines
applied -- allegedly produced by at least 9 laboratories, probably
significantly more -- be controlled, approved, and licensed by a competent
authority, complying with the requirements laid out in chapter 2.1.14 of
OIE's Manual of Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines for Terrestrial Animals. See
