43 inhabitants of Nyzhnejamsk contracted hemorrhagic fever with renal
syndrome (HFRS) during January [2009]. One man who contracted mouse
fever [HFRS] as a result of his occupation in industry died.
According to Natalia Gymranova of the Regional Rospotrebnadzor
Organization, currently the HFRS situation in the Nizhnekamsk
district remains serious. People working in industry, construction,
summer residents, and also outdoor recreation enthusiasts are most at
risk of contracting HFRS. Experts consider the principal cause of
disease to be non-observance of elementary rules of hygiene.
