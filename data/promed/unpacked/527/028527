Viral hemorrhagic septicemia cases confirmed in Ontario
-------------------------------------------------------------
The government of Canada today announced that the
Great Lakes strain of viral hemorrhagic
septicemia has been detected in fish from
Hamilton Harbour and the Thames River in Ontario.
These 2 findings mark the 1st detections of the disease in 2007 in Canada.
Viral hemorrhagic septicemia is an infectious
viral disease that can cause illness and death in
fish, but does not affect human health. Fish were
initially tested by the Ontario Ministry of
Natural Resources and the University of Guelph
before viral hemorrhagic septicemia was confirmed
by the Department of Fisheries and Oceans.
These findings fall within the Ontario ministry�s
identified management zone for the disease.
Therefore, no changes are planned to existing
Ontario live fish movement controls implemented
in early 2007. Viral hemorrhagic septicemia has
been detected in the St. Lawrence River and Great Lakes basin since 2005.
The government of Canada, in collaboration with
the provinces of Ontario and Quebec, is currently
conducting a surveillance program to better
understand the geographic distribution of the
virus and affected species. To date, fish from 6
sites in Ontario and Quebec have been tested, and
no additional cases of viral hemorrhagic
septicemia have been detected. The results of
this program, once analyzed, will help guide
actions that federal and provincial governments
may take to further manage the disease.
A similar, complementary surveillance program is
also underway in the United States to provide a
complete picture of the presence of viral
hemorrhagic septicemia in the Great Lakes basin.
A full report of 2007 viral hemorrhagic
septicemia findings from the joint
federal-provincial surveillance program will be
released in the fall. This program is expected to
continue for the next 2 years. Two provinces will
continue to collect fish in the fall of 2007 with
the collaboration of the Canadian Food Inspection
Agency. The Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources
will continue to collect additional samples with
provincial funding from the Canada-Ontario
Agreement Respecting the Great Lakes Basin Ecosystem.

[Viral hemorrhagic septicemia (VHS) virus is an
extremely serious pathogen of fresh and saltwater
fish, and is causing an emerging disease in the
Great Lakes region of the United States and
Canada. VHS has been found specifically in the
waters of Lake Huron, Lake St. Clair, Lake Erie,
Lake Ontario, and the St. Lawrence River. Due to
its high mortality and severe economic
consequences, VHS is classified as a reportable
disease by the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE). - Mod.TG]
