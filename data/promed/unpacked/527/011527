Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 - update 107
---------------------------------

Weekly update
------------
As of 27 Jun 2010, worldwide more than 214 countries and overseas
territories or communities have reported laboratory confirmed cases of
pandemic influenza H1N1 2009, including over 18 239 deaths.

WHO is actively monitoring the progress of the pandemic through
frequent consultations with the WHO Regional Offices and Member States
and through monitoring of multiple sources of information.

Situation update:
---------------
Summary: Worldwide, overall pandemic and seasonal influenza activity
remain low. In the temperate regions of the Southern Hemisphere,
Chile, and Argentina report low activity and only sporadic detections
of both pandemic and seasonal influenza viruses during the early part
of winter. South Africa, New Zealand, and Australia have all recently
noted slight increases in the rate of respiratory disease. South
Africa recently reported their 1st case of confirmed H1N1; however,
the predominant influenza virus there currently is seasonal influenza
A(H3N2). The H3N2 virus detected in South Africa is similar to the
Perth-like strain, which is currently a component of the trivalent
seasonal influenza vaccine.

Active transmission of pandemic influenza virus still persists in
localized areas of the tropics, particularly in South and Southeast
Asia, the Caribbean and West Africa. During the last 2 to 3 weeks,
seasonal influenza H3N2 viruses have also been detected at increasing
levels in Nicaragua, and at low levels or sporadically in Australia,
Central America, South Africa and East Africa. Global circulation of
seasonal influenza virus type B viruses persists at low levels in
parts of East Asia, Central Africa, and Central America.

Regional Details: In most countries of the temperate zone of the
southern hemisphere (Chile, Argentina, South Africa, Australia, and
New Zealand), pandemic and seasonal influenza viruses have been
detected only sporadically in June 2010, and activity is low,
indicating a late start of the influenza season compared to 2008.
Overall levels of respiratory disease in the population remain low. In
Argentina, small numbers of influenza type B viruses were detected
during mid June 2010. In both Chile and Argentina, respiratory
syncitial virus (RSV) continued to be the predominant circulating
respiratory virus resulting in high rates of respiratory illness in
children. In South Africa, small and slightly increasing numbers of
seasonal H3N2 and type B viruses were detected during mid June 2010.
In both Australia and New Zealand, levels of ILI [influenza-like
illness] are increasing but still below recent historical seasonal
levels.

In Asia,
--------
the most active areas of pandemic influenza virus transmission
currently are in parts of southern India, Bangladesh, Singapore, and
Malaysia. Rates are decreasing in the latter 3 countries, but in
India, the number of laboratory confirmed cases of pandemic influenza
has increased since mid June 2010. This activity has been primarily
observed in Southern state of Kerala, and includes reports of a number
of severe and fatal cases, particularly among pregnant women.

In Bangladesh, pandemic and seasonal influenza type B viruses
co-circulated at low levels during early June 2010. In Singapore,
during the 3rd week of June 2010, the levels of ARI [acute respiratory
infection] remained below warning levels, and the proportion of
patients with ILI testing positive for pandemic influenza virus fell
from 19 to 15 percent. In Malaysia, data suggest that overall pandemic
influenza activity has declined throughout June 2010, though pandemic
virus continues to circulate at low levels.

Throughout East Asia,
--------------------
influenza activity remained very low. In China and Japan, levels of
ILI remained at or below baseline levels for the summer months. Low
and declining levels of influenza type B viruses continued to
circulate across China, Hong Kong SAR (China), Chinese Taipei and the
Republic of Korea.

In the tropical regions of the Americas,
---------------------------------------
overall pandemic and seasonal influenza activity remained very low. In
Cuba, pandemic influenza virus transmission remains active but has
declined substantially since peaking during mid-April to mid-May 2010;
no new fatal cases have been reported over the past 5 reporting weeks.
In several countries of the region, there has been recent circulation
of seasonal influenza A (H3N2) viruses (Venezuela during May 2010) and
B viruses (Bolivia during March and May 2010; El Salvador during late
May and early June 2010). Nicaragua notably has seen a sharp increase
in the detection of seasonal influenza A (H3N2), and Panama has
detected low numbers of the same. In addition, after 20 weeks with no
circulating pandemic virus, Panama reported the detection of pandemic
influenza (H1N1) 2009 in early June 2010. Many countries in the area
also report ongoing co-circulation of other respiratory viruses, most
notably RSV.

In sub-Saharan Africa,
----------------------
pandemic and seasonal influenza activity has been observed in several
countries. Ghana, in West Africa, continues to have active circulation
of pandemic influenza virus several weeks after activity peaked during
early April 2010. Seasonal influenza type B viruses continue to
circulate in parts of central and southern Africa, most notably in
Cameroon. As reported in previous updates, small numbers of seasonal
H3N2 viruses continue to be detected across Africa, particularly in
eastern Africa; the most recent detections have been reported in
Ghana, Kenya, and South Africa during mid June 2010. The persistence
of H3N2 in this area over time very likely represents sustained
community transmission of the virus.

Overall, in the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere (North
America and Europe), pandemic and seasonal influenza viruses have been
detected sporadically or at very low levels during the past month.
