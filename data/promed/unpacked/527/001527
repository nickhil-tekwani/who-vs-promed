Benzene in South China
-------------------------------------------
Your comments about this matter are correct, but I would have hoped you
would mention that benzene's real carcinogenic potential is specifically as
a leukemogen. It is also a primary causal agent for aplastic anemia. The
[affected shoe factory workers in the article were described as having
"blood problems." I wonder if they have developed leukemia or aplastic
anemia?
