Anthrax has been found on a farm at Tatura, east of the outbreak area
at Stanhope in Victoria's Goulburn Valley. The Department of Primary
Industries has confirmed 4 more cattle have died from the bacterial
disease. It brings the total number of cattle, which have died from
anthrax to 29 since it was first detected 2 weeks ago. Since the
outbreak 5 properties have been affected, 4 of them in Stanhope.
Chief vet Hugh Millar says the farm at Tatura has been quarantined
and neighbouring property owners have been alerted. "These further
cases, clearly disappointing but not unexpected, but certainly don't
mean the routine containment and control procedures aren't effective," he said.
More than 10 000 cattle are being vaccinated against the disease.

[If there had not been the cases near Stanhope, I very much suspect
that these recent Tatura cases might have been missed. Increased
awareness equals questions on deaths instead of just calling the
local knacker to come pick up the carcasses. Tatura is due east of
Stanhope and only a few miles away. (Check them out on Google.earth
<http://earth.google.com/>) There have been anthrax outbreaks in
Tatura in the past so this could well be just a usual background
sporadic anthrax outbreak, possibly compounded by the owner not
reacting quickly when the 1st cow died -- we saw these "normals"
during the epidemic in Saskatchewan last summer [2006]. Let us hope
so. If it reflects fly spread from the Stanhope index farm, there may
be others waiting to declare themselves. Either way, farmers in the
Goulburn valley need to be on the alert. I presume that the Tatura
"neighbouring property owners" have been told by Hugh in no uncertain
Oz-fashion to get their stock vaccinated PDQ (pretty darn quick). - Mod.MHJ]
