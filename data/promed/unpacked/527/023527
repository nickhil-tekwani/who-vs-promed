A man from Abbottabad [Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province] has died of Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) at the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (PIMS), while his father and brother have been admitted to the hospital after succumbing to the same tick-borne zoonotic viral disease.

One of the deceased's brothers had already lost his life to CCHF, which, according to World Health Organisation [WHO], has a high fatality rate (10-40 per cent). They all are butchers by profession. Dr Ayesha Isani Majeed, spokesperson for PIMS, told 'The (International) News' on Thursday [12 Sep 2013] that a 60-year-old man and his 21- and 28-year-old sons had been moved from the Combined Military Hospital in Abbottabad, 1st to the Military Hospital in Rawalpindi and then to the PIMS on Wednesday [11 Sep 2013] in critical condition. Dr Majeed said that the 3 were found to be infected with CCHF [virus] and immediately admitted to an isolation ward and given antiviral treatment (Ribavirin tablets) without delay. "[The 21-year-old] breathed his last at 11:35 p.m. (Wednesday, 11 Sep 2013) despite all resuscitative measures, while the 60-year-old father and his 28-year-old other son were shifted to an intensive care unit, where they are receiving the best possible treatment," she said.

Earlier this year [2013], the PIMS treated 2 other CCHF patients, a local woman and a man from Saudi Arabia.

According to a WHO expert, CCHF is a viral haemorrhagic fever transmitted by ticks; it can be responsible for severe outbreaks in humans, but it is not pathogenic for ruminants, their amplifying host. "CCHF spreads to humans either by tick-bites, or through contact with viraemic animal tissues during and immediately post-slaughter." The WHO expert said that CCHF outbreaks constituted a threat to public health services because of its epidemic potential, its high case fatality ratio (10-40 per cent), its potential for nosocomial outbreaks and the difficulties in treatment and prevention. He said CCHF was endemic in all of Africa, the Balkans, the Middle East and Asia.

[Since the previous report (see: Crimean-Congo hem. fever - Pakistan (03): (KP) fatalities, archive no. 20130914.1944511), the number of CCHF victims has been increased to 3 (a father and his 2 sons all working as butchers). The youngest of the 3 has now died and the father and his elder son are in serious condition. CCHF virus is transmitted to people either by tick bites or through contact with infected animal blood or tissues during and immediately after slaughter. The majority of cases have occurred in people involved in the livestock industry, such as agricultural workers, slaughterhouse workers and veterinarians. As the father and his 2 sons worked as butchers, it is likely that they became infected in the course of their work rather than as result of tick bites.

The length of the incubation period depends on the mode of acquisition of the virus. Following infection by a tick bite, the incubation period is usually 1 to 3 days, with a maximum of 9 days. The incubation period following contact with infected blood or tissues is usually 5 to 6 days, with a documented maximum of 13 days.

General supportive care with treatment of symptoms is the main approach to managing CCHF in people. The antiviral drug ribavirin has been used to treat CCHF infection with apparent benefit. Both oral and intravenous formulations seem to be effective.
