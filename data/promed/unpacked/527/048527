West Nile virus surveillance data as of Tue 4 Nov 2003
------------------------------------------------------
Human -- cumulative data
------------------------
As of Tue 4 Nov 2003 there have been a total of 1300 probable or confirmed
cases of human infection in Canada and 10 deaths (an increase of 44 cases
and no deaths since Wed 29 Oct 2003). Saskatchewan remains the most
severely affected province with 767 probable or confirmed cases and 6
deaths followed by Alberta with 266 confirmed cases and no deaths. 36 of
the 44 new cases were reported from Saskatchewan.
Province / No. probable cases / No. confirmed cases / No. of deaths
Nova Scotia / 0 / 2* / 0
New Brunswick / 1* / 0 / 0
Quebec / 5 / 12 / 0
Ontario / 0 / 88* / 2**
Manitoba / 104 / 35/ 2
Saskatchewan / 729 / 38 / 6
Alberta / 0 / 266 / 0
British Columbia 7* / 12* / 0
Yukon 1* / 0 / 0
Total 847 / 453 / 10
*Linked to travel outside of province
** 2 probable cases; death due to other causes
[The probable cases in British Columbia, New Brunswick and Yukon, and the
confirmed cases in Nova Scotia are considered to be travel-related and not
indigenous. The 2 fatal cases and one of the probable cases in Ontario are
considered to be travel-related and not indigenous cases.
In 2002, there were 416 probable or confirmed cases of human West Nile
virus infection in Canada and 21 deaths attributed to the virus. All the
deaths and most of the cases occurred in Ontario and Quebec, in contrast to
the situation in 2003 when few cases have been reported from Ontario and
Quebec, and overall considerably fewer fatalities. - Mod.CP]
Equines -- cumulative data
--------------------------
As of Tue 4 Nov 2003, 445 presumptive or confirmed equine cases have been
reported; Nova Scotia (1), Quebec (8), Ontario (41), Manitoba (53),
Saskatchewan (162), Alberta (180).
[Since the previous update of Wed 29 Oct 2003, the number of presumptive or
confirmed equine cases of West Nile virus infection remains unchanged.
There have been no reports of new equine cases of West Nile virus infection
during the past 20 days. - Mod.CP]
Mosquitoes -- cumulative data
-----------------------------
As of Tue 4 Nov 2003, 578 pools of mosquitoes have tested positive; Quebec
(88), Ontario (134), Manitoba (290), Saskatchewan (35), Alberta (31).
[Since Wed 29 Oct 2003 the number of West Nile virus-positive mosquito
pools has increased by 8 (all reported from Ontario). In contrast to the
data for other animals, the greatest number of West Nile virus-positive
mosquito pools was recorded in the province of Manitoba (50 per cent),
whereas relatively few were found in Saskatchewan (6 per cent) and Alberta
(5 per cent). There have been no extensions of range. - Mod.CP]
Wild birds -- cumulative data
-----------------------------
As of Tue 4 Nov 2003, the following test results by province have been
reported:
Province / No. submitted for testing / No.tested / No. confirmed positive
Newfoundland and Labrador / 69 / 64/ 0
Prince Edward Island / 273 / 254 / 0
Nova Scotia / 961 / 903 / 16
New Brunswick / 886/ 819 / 6
Quebec / 2711 / 2576 / 841
Ontario* / 1715/ 1482 / 242
Manitoba / 924 / 826 / 133
Saskatchewan / 1193 / 953 / 157
Alberta / 1499 / 1482 / 232
British Columbia / 1935 / 1906 / 0
Yukon / 14 / 13/ 0
Northwest Territories / 23/ 21 / 0
Nunavut / 3/ 3 / 0
*Note that in the Ontario count; after the 4th confirmed positive bird, no
further testing is carried out and the birds are listed as presumed positive.
[The totals for Canada for 2003 so far are 12 206 birds submitted for
testing, 11 303 birds tested, and 1632 confirmed West Nile virus-positive.
In addition there were 3770 sightings of dead birds. This represents an
increase of 46 birds tested (a decline on the previous period) and 4 more
birds confirmed West Nile virus-positive (compared with 296, 90, 11, and 9
in the 4 preceding weeks.)
Overall these figures, indicating a further reduction in new human cases
(except in Saskatchewan) and virus-positive wild birds, together with the
absence of new equine cases, signify the imminent end of the outbreak,
coincident with the onset of colder weather. - Mod.CP]
