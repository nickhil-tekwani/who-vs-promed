Glycopeptide Intermediate Resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_(GISA) death in
Scotland
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Laboratory tests have confirmed that a patient who died last week in a
hospital in Lanarkshire, Scotland, was infected with a Glycopeptide
intermediate resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_ (GISA) (1). GISA [or VISA
for vancomycin intermediate resistant _S. aureus_ - Mod.LL] has increased
resistance to first line antibiotics used for treating infections caused by
methicillin resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_ (MRSA), namely, vancomycin
and teicoplanin (2). This is the second report of an infection with this
organism for Scotland, and possibly the first report in the United Kingdom
of an associated death (3).
The patient, a woman in her early 50s, was admitted for routine bowel
surgery, but contracted MRSA while in an intensive therapy unit. Although
the patient was treated for over 70 non-consecutive days with either
vancomycin or teicoplanin in combination with meropenem or gentamicin or
rifampin, the MRSA persisted and eventually developed resistance to
glycopeptide antibiotics (vancomycin minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)
8mg/L) [8 micrograms/mL - Mod.LL]. Postmortem findings confirmed tricuspid
endocarditis with metastatic abscesses throughout the lungs. The patient
had been previously fit and well, apart from mild obesity and hypertension.
All patients, staff, and family members in contact with the patient during
the period in which the MRSA acquired this additional resistance have been
offered screening as a precautionary measure. There is little evidence to
show transmission of this organism from person to person and it is unlikely
that there is any danger to the general public (4). The unit was closed,
cleaned, and screened before reopening.
The isolate was identified and characterised by the Scottish MRSA reference
laboratory. Not all routine susceptibility testing can detect GISA; current
opinion favours the use of multiple confirmatory methods, including Etests
and macrodilution with a variety of media and inocula (5). A reasonable
first approach would be to test isolates from MRSA patients not responding
clinically to glycopeptides with Etest, using inocula matched to the
opacity of a 2 McFarland on Brain Heart Infusion agar, with both vancomycin
and teicoplanin E-test strips. GISA isolates require vancomycin MICs of
8-16 mg/L. Screening can also be performed by a breakpoint dilution method
using 5mg/l vancomycin incorporated into Mueller Hinton agar or 6 mg/L
vancomycin in Brain Heart Infusion agar (6).
