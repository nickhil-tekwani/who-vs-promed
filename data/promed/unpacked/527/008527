[It is very encouraging to see this timely report that indicates quick
response to an increase in dog rabies in Luanda. This report also indicates
that the animal health authorities have made significant and effective
efforts to vaccinate dogs. Of course, vaccination must be combined with
control of stray dogs and public education, but there appears to be
considerable activity in this regard at present.

This is to be commended and was absolutely necessary as Luanda experienced
a very serious rabies outbreak that killed 93 children as of March 2009.
ProMED-mail would like to know if the number of human cases has indeed
declined since the 12 Mar 2009 posting.
