[Ref: JG Hubert et al: First report of _Rice yellow mottle virus_ on rice in Democratic Republic of Congo. Plant Disease (2013); DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS-06-13-0650-PDN]
-----------------------------------------------
_Rice yellow mottle virus_ (RYMV) is a widespread rice pathogen reported in nearly all rice-growing countries of Africa. Although the virus was detected in Cameroun, Chad, Tanzania, Rwanda, Burundi and Uganda, RYMV has never been described in Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).

In July 2012, plants with leaf yellowing and mottling symptoms were observed in large irrigated rice production schemes and lowland subsistence fields in the area of Bukavu, in the east of the DRC. Several dozens of hectares affected by the disease were abandoned by the farmers. Symptomatic leaf samples were collected in different farmer fields. Back-inoculations to susceptible rice variety IR64 resulted in the same yellowing and mottling symptoms 7-9 days post-inoculation.

Infected leaves gave positive results using Double Antibody Sandwich (DAS) -ELISA tests with polyclonal antisera, indicating for the 1st time the presence of RYMV in DRC. Triple Antibody Sandwich (TAS) -ELISA tests with discriminant monoclonal antibodies revealed that they all belong to Serotype 4 found in the neighboring region in Rwanda. From total RNA extracts of 3 samples, the 720 nucleotide coat protein (CP) gene was amplified by (RT-PCR).

A set of CP sequences of 45 isolates representative of the RYMV diversity in Africa, including the sequences of the DRC samples, were used for phylogenetic reconstruction. The DRC isolates belonged to strain S4-lv mainly found around Lake Victoria. Specifically, within the S4-lv strain, the DRC isolates clustered with isolates from eastern and southern provinces of Rwanda and Burundi, respectively, suggesting a recent spread from these countries. Similar yellowing and mottling symptoms have been observed in Bas-Congo and Equateur provinces of the country, which would justify further surveys and characterisation of RYMV in the DRC.

Recently, efforts [in DRC] have been directed to shift from the traditional upland system to lowland and irrigated systems in which water availability allows sequential planting and maintenance of higher crop intensity. This agricultural change may increase insect vectors and alternate host plant populations, which may result in higher RYMV incidence.

[_Rice yellow mottle virus_ (RYMV; genus _Sobemovirus_, not yet assigned to family or order) causes yellow mottle disease of rice, which was originally confined to one district of Kenya. However, large-scale rice irrigation projects lead to build up and wide dissemination of the virus and its vectors in sub-Saharan Africa. Yield losses of up to 100 percent have been reported.

Besides rice, RYMV also affects a number of other grass species. Symptoms may include stunting, reduced tillering, mottling and yellowish or orange (depending on host genotype) streaking of the leaves, delayed flowering or incomplete emergence of the panicles and, in extreme cases, death of plants. RYMV is spread by a number of insect vectors, mainly by several leaf beetle species (_Chrysomelidae_; for example _Chaetocnema pulla_). It does not appear to be seed transmitted in rice, but it can be spread by mechanical means, which is thought to account for much of its spread in the field (RYMV often increases after switch of cultivation methods from direct seeding to transplanting of seedlings). The virus survives in crop residues, and volunteer rice and grassy weeds serve as pathogen reservoirs. Disease management includes cultural practices as well as control of vectors and reservoir hosts. A few resistant rice varieties for specific cultivation systems are known.

RYMV is highly variable, and different strains may have different levels of virulence. Consequently, specific resistance breeding programmes for local virus strains and local rice varieties are needed. While highly competitive annual and perennial wild rice species are considered an important constraint to rice production in the region, their elimination would result in serious loss of rice genetic diversity including potential sources of genetic resistance to RYMV and other pathogens. The preservation of wild relatives of rice for research purposes is an important prerequisite for the success of future breeding programmes.
