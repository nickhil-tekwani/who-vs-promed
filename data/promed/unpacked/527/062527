The Akim (regional governor) of the Akzhaik district [West Kazakhstan region], Adil Zhulamanov, held a press conference addressing the development program for the region to 2020 and addressed questions raised by journalists.

The following question was raised by Clara Qambetova ("Kazakhstan - Ural" channel):

"In June this year [2016], there were outbreaks of an animal disease in the Akzhaik district. Is there any problem in terms of research results and the prevalence of the disease? What has been done to limit the scope of the event?"

Adil Zhulmanov's reply:

During 10-15 Jun [2016], disease was recorded in a cattle holding on the territory adjacent to the village of Chapayevo.

The mass media spread information mentioning foot-and-mouth disease [FMD]. We took all required precautionary measures which are related to an infectious disease such as FMD. For example, animal movement restrictions. Pathological material was sent for examination in the regional laboratory. The same samples were sent also to the national laboratory in Astana. According to the results obtained from Astana, pasteurellosis [or/and FMD? machine translation not clear - Mod.AS] were suspected. [The text in Kazakh mentions also esophagus and aorta; the machine translation may be misunderstood or misleading. - Mod.AS] About 40 cows were diseased and 7-8 calves died. The disease does not affect human health, thus there is no obstacle for the sale of slaughtered cattle. Today the situation has stabilized.

[In case the above machine translation includes significant inaccuracies, their correction by Kazakh readers will be gratefully welcomed. - Mod.AS]

[Chapaev is a village ("selo") in Akzhaik district in north-western Kazakhstan (map at http://tinyurl.com/hskjzev). Detailed information of the results on material from the mentioned event, from both laboratories, will be helpful. Has material been submitted to the reference laboratory (FGI-ARRIAH, Vladimir, Russia)?

Several earlier expressions of concern have been published in Kazakhi bloggers' sites, mentioning disease signs which may be suggestive of FMD, such as excessive salivation, ulcers, loss of corns and hoof lesions, similarly in West Kazakhstan.

In view of Kazakhstan's FMD status (see further), definite information, confirming FMD or otherwise, is essential.

According to the provisions of chapter 8.7 of OIE's Terrestrial Code, member countries may be recognised as having an "FMD free zone where vaccination is not practised". Imports from such zones are liable to permissive requirements.

According to OIE's website, Kazakhstan is included among the Member Countries having an FMD free zone where vaccination is not practised, according to the provisions of Chapter 8.7 of the Terrestrial Code, Edition 2014 (http://www.oie.int/en/animal-health-in-the-world/official-disease-status/fmd/list-of-fmd-free-members/), as follows:

"Kazakhstan:
One zone consisting of the regions of Akmola, Aktobe, Atyrau, West Kazakhstan, Karaganda, Kostanay, Mangystau, Pavlodar and North Kazakhstan, as designated by the Delegate of Kazakhstan in a document addressed to the Director General in August 2014; map at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Animal_Health_in_the_World/map/A_Kazakhstan.jpg."

As can be seen in the map, the regions in the FMD-free zone without vaccination border, besides Russia (the longest common border), also Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. Information on the FMD situation in these countries will be helpful as well. - Mod.AS
