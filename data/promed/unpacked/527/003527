Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF), which provides medical humanitarian aid worldwide, is waging a war against kala azar [visceral leishmaniasis] in Bihar.

Hundreds have benefited since MSF started its project in Vaishali in 2007. In March 2012, the Switzerland-headquartered body formally joined hands with the Bihar government.

A disease transmitted by the sand fly, Kala Azar has killed in the past few decades many hundreds in Bihar, the state worst hit by it. Over 70 people died last year [2011].

Since 1988, MSF has treated more than 100 000 kala azar patients in Sudan, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, Uganda and Bangladesh besides India. Its doctors provide liposomal amphotericin B, a safe and effective drug.

MSF says that it has treated more than 10 000 patients with an initial cure rate of over 98 percent in the last 5 years in Vaishali as well as neighbouring districts.

All treatment is free of cost, says MSF project coordinator Delphine Altwegg. It says it cured around 2000 patients each year in the last 5 years.

[Kala azar or visceral leishmaniasis is endemic in India. A recent study (Singh N et al. Animal reservoirs of visceral leishmaniasis in Bihar, India. J Parasitol. 2012 Jul 5. [Epub ahead of print]; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22765517) found goats to be an important reservoir.

The distribution of leishmaniasis in Bihar has been mapped (Bhunia GS et al. Localization of kala-azar in the endemic region of Bihar, India based on land use/land cover assessment at different scales. Geospat Health. 2012;6:177-93).

More information on leishmaniasis can be found at the CDC and WHO websites (http://www.cdc.gov/parasites/leishmaniasis/index.html, http://www.who.int/leishmaniasis/en/). - Mod.EP
