The March 21 issue of Science will publish a paper regarding the Initial
Genetic Characterization of the virus which caused the 1918 pandemic.
Although sequencing is incomplete, it nevertheless, provides some insight
into thenature of this virus and how it differs from other influenza
viruses which have previously been sequenced.
The work is based on RT-PCR analysis of very small mRNA fragments
preserved in an autopsy specimen, and represents several years of effort
which was generally met with less than stellar success. The persistence
of the authors of this paper, Dr. Jeffery Taubenberger, Ann Reid, Amy
Krafft, Thomas Fanning and Karen Bijwaard of the Armed Forces Institute of
Pathology finally paid off, though, and the work presented in this paper
is what resulted.

[The sequences were obtained from the preserved lung tissue of an American
soldier who died in 1918. The hemagglutinin gene is different from all
presently known influenza viruses, but closest to that of swine influenza.
It is claimed by the authors that the virus originated in American pigs and
was spread around Europe by American troops being shipped there during
World War I, whence the name "Spanish flu." - Mod.JW
