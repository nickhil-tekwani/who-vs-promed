The 1st case of [a] hantavirus [infection] was confirmed for the Coquimbo region by the Public Health Institute.

This case is a 39-year-old agricultural worker who died in the Antonio Tirado Lanas Hospital in Ovalle. The individual began to feel the symptoms of the virus, was hospitalized, and died later. Samples were sent to Santiago, where the presence of the hantavirus in his body was confirmed.

The infection was acquired in a rural sector between Ovalle and Monte Patria. Health authorities stated that they will carry out work in the area in order to locate where the infection occurred. Besides providing words to calm the citizens, they signaled that the area does not present characteristics where the rodent [reservoir] can easily proliferate. In line with this, they assured that this corresponds to an isolated case.

[Although not specified in this or previous reports from this and other regions, the hantavirus involved in these 2 cases no doubt is Andes virus. This virus is endemic in Chile, including in the 2 regions, and cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome occur every year. This is the beginning of the summer season, when cases of hantavirus infection occur. The patients likely came into contact with areas inhabited by the rodent reservoir of the virus in the regions. Andes hantavirus is endemic in the Andean region of Chile, and cases occur there every year.

Andes virus is rarely transmitted directly person to person and only through close physical contact, usually within the family. The most common source of the infection is the long-tailed pygmy rice rat. Images of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_), the Sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus, can be seen at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligoryzomys_longicaudatus#/media/File:Raton_colilarga.jpg. - Mod.TY
