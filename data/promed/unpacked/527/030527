The ongoing health crisis in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa appears to be compounded by the surge in typhoid fever cases. Already struggling to control the spread of the Covid-19 virus, the province is now dealing with a rapid increase in typhoid fever cases. According to details, in rural areas of the province, a significant number of households are suffering from the [potentially] life-threatening infection caused by the bacterium _Salmonella_ Typhi. The disease spreads through contaminated food or water. In Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P), the disease has reared its head at a time when the novel coronavirus is spreading like wildfire.

The disease, which can have similar symptoms as the Covid-19 virus, has baffled healthcare authorities in the province."Hundreds of cases are being reported in KP each day," claimed Dr. Saud, who heads the coronavirus isolation ward at the Khyber Teaching Hospital in Peshawar. Misreporting, Dr. Saud said, must stop. The Widal test, which has been the mainstay of typhoid fever diagnosis for decades, he said, is not accurate. "All over the world, blood culture is the easiest way to diagnose typhoid," he claimed.

While most testing facilities are encouraging patients to undergo the Widal test, medical practitioners appear to be opposing it. "We receive 15-20 patients every day," claimed Sajjad, a lab technician at the Lady Reading Hospital. "More than 300 patients test positive every month," he added. Antibacterials, according to the World Health Organization, are commonly used to treat the infection. According to the global health body's dedicated webpage for the disease, even when the symptoms go away, patients may still carry typhoid bacteria, meaning they can spread it to others through their feces.

"More than 80 patients test positive every week," said Farhad Khan, the spokesperson for Khyber Teaching Hospital in Peshawar. Figures received from the Lady Reading Hospital show more than 1000 patients have undergone blood culture tests for typhoid.

"As long as the Covid-19 virus is infecting people in KP, I would recommend everyone to get tested immediately for it, and then for typhoid," cautioned Dr. Shehzad, who heads the Hayatabad Medical Complex in Peshawar. Both diseases, according to Dr. Shehzad, have overlapping symptoms.

Dr. Fazlur Rehman, who has served at a known testing facility, for more than 2 decades, said medical practitioners must urge patients to get a blood culture when symptoms surface. "Instead of spreading fear, patients must immediately get a culture done," he said. The Widal test, he said, is now outdated and can mislead medical practitioners.

[It is not stated if the outbreak is caused by the extremely drug resistant strains which have been described in parts of Pakistan.

Typhoid fever, so-called enteric fever caused by _Salmonella enterica_ serotype Typhi, has a totally different presentation from that of the commoner kinds of salmonellosis. Epidemiologically, usually spread by contaminated food or water, typhoid is not a zoonosis like the more commonly seen types of salmonellosis. Clinically, vomiting and diarrhea are typically absent; indeed, constipation is frequently reported. As it is a systemic illness, blood cultures are at least as likely to be positive as stool in enteric fever, particularly early in the course of the infection, and bone marrow cultures may be the most sensitive.

The symptoms of classical typhoid fever typically include fever, anorexia, lethargy, malaise, dull continuous headache, non-productive cough, vague abdominal pain, and constipation. Despite the (often high) fever, the pulse is often only slightly elevated. During the 2nd week of the illness, there is protracted fever and mental dullness, classically called coma vigil. Diarrhea may develop but usually does not. Many patients develop hepatosplenomegaly (both liver and spleen enlarged). After the 1st week or so, many cases develop a maculopapular rash on the upper abdomen. These lesions ("rose spots") are about 2 cm (0.78 in) in diameter and blanch on pressure. They persist for 2-4 days and may come and go. Mild and atypical infections are common.

The word typhoid (as in typhus-like) reflects the similarity of the louse-borne rickettsial disease epidemic typhus and that of typhoid fever; in fact, in some areas, typhoid fever is still referred to as abdominal typhus. - Mod.LL
