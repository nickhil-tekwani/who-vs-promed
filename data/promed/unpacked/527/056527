Background information on multilocular echinococcosis in Japan
----------------------------------------------
Multilocular echinococcosis is reported from Hokkaido (notably Rebun
Island) and the Kuril Islands. Local risk factors include working
with cattle and pigs and use of well water. A total of 373 cases were
reported during 1937 to 1997 (141 of these since 1984) -- 131 on
Rebun Island and 222 on Hokkaido.
In 1995, 150 clinical cases were confirmed on Hokkaido and another
495 island residents were found to be seropositive, despite the
absence of cysts on ultrasound. 76 cases were identified in 21
prefectures outside of Hokkaido during 1926 to 1996. 208 cases were
registered in Kon-sen during 1965 to 1997.
