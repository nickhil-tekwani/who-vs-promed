Hong Kong culls chickens to halt "bird flu"
------------------------------------------------------------
Hong Kong authorities have destroyed 16 000 chickens and stopped imports of
the bird from China until New Year's Eve in an effort to prevent a repeat
of a fatal "bird flu" which killed 6 people in the city in 1997.
The cull was carried out at a poultry farm in northern, rural New
Territories, after more than 1000 chickens were found dead there earlier on
Sat, 28 Dec 2002.
On Friday, a dozen birds tested at the farm in the Ta Kwu Ling area were
found to have been infected with avian flu virus, the government said in a
statement. A government spokesman also said chicken imports from mainland
China would be halted until 31 Dec 2002 so that it could shut a poultry
wholesale market for cleansing and disinfection. The infected farm had
earlier made deliveries to the market.
"To minimise the risk on the possible spreading of the virus, we need to
thoroughly cleanse the wholesale market to eliminate (any) virus that might
exist there," the spokesman said.
The cull was the largest since earlier this year when the government
slaughtered some 900 000 chickens after the third major bird flu outbreak.
The congested territory of 6.8 million people has been hit by 3 major bird
flu outbreaks in the last 5 years, each time leading to massive culls. In
1997 and 2001, Hong Kong's entire chicken population of over one million
birds were slaughtered.

[The following additional data are derived from another news item,
Canada.com, 28 Dec 2002,

1. The virus was not of the same strain that crossed over into humans and
killed 6 people in 1997, officials said.
2. Officials from the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department
visited 14 nearby farms and found no abnormal deaths among chickens there,
it added.
3. Earlier Saturday, officials said samples from dead and sick birds found
at an urban park earlier this month have tested positive for avian flu.
4. Tests showed that 6 of 18 sick birds and 12 of 45 dead ones contracted
avian flu, said spokeswoman Suzanne Ho.
5. Officials drained and disinfected several ponds at the park last week.
The remaining birds have been quarantined and vaccinated against bird flu.
6. Many Hong Kong people prefer live poultry from wet markets (traditional
vending stands selling fresh fruit and vegetables, meat, and fish
<http://atn-riae.agr.ca/info/asia/e3377.htm> - Mod.MPP), where chickens are
packed into cages as they wait to be slaughtered on the spot so customers
can take them home as fresh as possible.
On 13 Sep 2002, the Director of Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation
Department, Hong Kong reported to the OIE that highly pathogenic (HPAI)
H5N1 viruses were isolated from surveillance swabbing of cages or
individual dead chickens in retail markets in April, May, and June, and
that the retail markets have a rest day each month on which all birds are
slaughtered and the premises cleaned and disinfected to break the virus
cycle. In 1997, the deadly H5N1 virus crossed over from birds to humans,
leading officials to slaughter all the 1.4 million chickens in Hong Kong.
The current outbreak shows that the described serious measures were not
sufficient to stop the evolvement of the virus. This is the background to
the eventual Hong Kong authorities resorting to vaccination. In most
countries, vaccines specifically designed to contain or prevent HPAI are
banned or discouraged by government agencies because they may interfere
with stamping-out control policies. However, during the 1990s the
prophylactic use of inactivated oil-emulsion vaccines was employed in
Mexico and Pakistan to control widespread outbreaks of HPAI.
The AI virus strain involved in the current outbreak has not been named in
the said news items; its early identification is a matter of importance and
urgency. - Mod.AS]
