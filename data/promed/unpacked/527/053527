A child has become the 3rd person diagnosed with the measles in less than a week in New South Wales. NSW Health on [Wed 2 Jan 2019] night said the child had presented to Royal North Shore hospital after becoming infected. A spokeswoman said staff are still confirming details about the latest case with more information expected on [Thu 3 Jan 2019].

It is the 3rd confirmed case in less than a week after NSW Health earlier on [Wed 2 Jan 2019] said a visitor from the ACT was diagnosed with the infection.

The ACT resident was infectious while visiting the central coast and Sydney's northern suburbs between [26 and 30 Dec 2018] [...]

It follows another confirmed case on [29 Dec 2018] when a young adult from Sydney returned from Thailand and was diagnosed with measles.

The Directorate General of Health (DGS) in Portugal announced recently the 37 measles cases have been confirmed in the country, mostly in adults, since November [2018], according to a Diario de Noticias report (computer translated).

In addition, it was noted that there are 3 different and distinct outbreaks. In Cascais, 24 confirmed cases and 2 probable cases have been reported, which started from an imported case from Ukraine. There is also an outbreak in Oeiras, with 5 confirmed cases, originating in a case imported from the Czech Republic. On the Madeira island, 3 confirmed cases are being investigated.

The DGS also reports that since [8 Nov 2018], 5 isolated cases have been confirmed, "with no known epidemiological link to these outbreaks and that they are being investigated."

A case of measles has led health authorities to a select group of people in Hood River and The Dalles.

The person with measles visited the OHSU [Oregon Health & Science University] Hospital emergency room in Portland on [Wed 2 Jan 2019]. The virus was confirmed [Thu 3 Jan 2019]. The infected person traveled from out of the county to Hood River [OR] and The Dalles [OR].

Since diagnosis, the person has taken recommended precautions not to continue to spread the highly contagious virus.

Two measles outbreaks over the summer affected at least 4 people.

While there have been no related cases of measles reported yet, the Oregon Health Authority has issued a warning to people who were in the emergency room from 9 a.m. to noon and who visited the places [listed in the URL above] at the end of December.[dates also listed in the URL].

Most people in the area have been vaccinated and have a low risk, the Health Authority said.

Meanwhile, in a separate case, authorities in Clark County are investigating a confirmed case of measles in a child. Clark County Public Health said [Fri 4 Dec 2018] that the child, whose immunization status is unverified, traveled to Clark County from outside of the country in late December [2018].

[A 2nd report from Fox News stated that the Clark County Public Health Department in Washington reported a confirmed case of measles in a child who traveled to Clark County from outside the country in late December 2018 (see above). The child, whose immunization status is unverified, visited an urgent care clinic in Vancouver, Wash., from noon to 5:30 p.m. on 31 Dec 2018, possibly exposing other patients at the clinic. - Mod.LK]

A father with measles visited the preemie ward at Bnei Brak's Mayanei HaYeshua Hospital on [Thu 3 Jan 2019] endangers dozens of Babies by entering without informing any hospital personnel he had been diagnosed with measles.

When it was learned the father was ill, staff members were quick to vaccinate over 80 babies, some only a day or 2 old.

According to the Yisrael Hayom newspaper report filed by Ron Reznik and Meital Yasur Beit-Ohr, the hospital decided to vaccinate all of the 24 preemies in the unit along with 60 babies in the adjacent unit. It is explained that since children are usually vaccinated after a year, in this case, due to the circumstances, they were given the regular vaccination and not a prophylactic treatment.

Professor Moti Ravid, director of the hospital, is quoted telling the newspaper, "This is a wild and inconsiderate act, not to mention that the same man endangered his son, along with placing other babies at risk. A guard is posted and so far, we have concentrated mainly on preventing the entry of visiting children. From now on, we will also guard the entry of adults, and we also hung signs around the hospital asking visitors with fever or a rash not to enter the hospital."

Ravid adds, "Someone who does not feel good should not visit a hospital, or shul and yeshiva for that matter".

According to Health Ministry data, up until last week, 3030 cases of measles have been diagnosed in Israel including 502 new cases which were diagnosed in December 2018.

[If the mother had her MMR shots and/or had measles infection earlier in life, or if the mother breastfeeds, antibody will be passively transferred to the newborn. Those antibodies should be protective for up to 6 months or more. For this reason, babies don't get the MMR shot earlier than 1 year old. Nonetheless, the decision to vaccinate the newborn babies was wise following the blatant disregard for their safety by the infected individual, because the immunization status of the mothers was likely unknown. - Mod.LK]

Several instances of possible reactions to the MR vaccine in India were reported in a ProMED posting on 5 Jan 2019. In conjunction with studies on genetic immune defects associated with severe or unusual infections, we are studying rare, but frequently fatal, reactions to the MMR vaccine. The fatal reactions in the 1- year-old at Nagpur in Maharashtra and the 11-year-old girl, from Bhandara's Lakhni tehsil are particularly worthy of investigation to rule out such defects.

Our studies thus far have revealed defects in the type I and III IFN [interferon] signaling pathways. Investigation of additional families is ongoing.

Precise estimates of the incidence of severe reactions to the measles component of MR and MMR vaccines are not available, but are likely of the order of a few cases per million vaccinees. The benefits of the live virus measles vaccines far outweighs these rare reactions.

[ProMED thanks Dr. Seligman for his comment regarding the adverse reactions to the measles vaccine.

MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) and MR (measles, rubella) are live vaccines composed of attenuated virus. Live vaccines are significantly more immunogenic than inactivated vaccines, since natural subclinical infection is imitated, thereby inducing a wide range of immunologic responses, including both humoral (B cells) and cellular (CD8+and CD4+ T cells). Furthermore, the dosage administered is low, leading to low cost of preparation and limited allergic response. Although booster inoculations are often recommended, a single vaccine administration may be sufficient to induce long-term, sometimes even lifelong, protection.

One disadvantage of live vaccines is that they may revert to natural virulence via back or compensatory mutations of the attenuated organism. This can lead to symptoms similar to wild-type virus infection in the recipient or in unprotected contacts (e.g., vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis after oral poliovirus vaccine, OPV). (edited excerpt from https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/immunology-and-microbiology/live-vaccines). In addition, live vaccines are labile and generally must be maintained in a cold chain, and interference with naturally infecting agents can occur leading to vaccine failure.

However, as brought up by Dr. Seligman, above, in regard to measles, the benefits of live virus vaccines far outweigh these rare reactions. - Mod.LK]
