South Korea: pathogen associated with conjunctivitis outbreak
-------------------------------------------------------------
[The following information has been supplied by Dr Chun Kang of the Korean
National Instigate of Health in relation to the ProMED-mail post entitled:
"Conjunctivitis - South Korea 20030918.2362". ProMED-mail appreciates this
rapid response to our request for further information. - Mod.CP]
Until August [2003], adenovirus type 8 and adenovirus type 37 had been
isolated by cell culture. They were typed by sequencing and real-time
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in the hexon gene region. Adenovirus type
4, which is known to cause pharyngoconjunctivitis, was also isolated.
But [since then], no adenoviruses have been isolated, though enteroviruses
have been found, which coincided with the clinical diagnosis by doctors.
