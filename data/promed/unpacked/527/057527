An outbreak of malaria and Japanese encephalitis has killed 120 people over
the past month in areas along the India-Nepal border, a senior health
official in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh said on Wednesday.
V. K. Dewan, state principal secretary for medical and health issues, said
that 32 people were killed by malaria in the eastern district of Bahraich
over the past week alone. He said that medicines and insecticides had been
rushed to the affected areas, and the World Health Organisation and the
U.N. Children's fund had sent teams to the affected areas to assist state
health department officials.

"Adequate measures are being taken to contain the disease before they take
the form of an epidemic," Dewan said.

[No telling from this how many of these 120 people died of JE.
We have also received the following, which is from a Katmandu (Nepal)
newspaper.
"Japanese Encephalitis was first identified in the Gangetic plain, in the
region of the Nepalese Terai, along the border between Nepal and India,
in 1978. Since then annual epidemics of varying sizes have been recorded
by the Nepalese Ministry of Health during the rainy season. The largest
number of reported cases was 2953 in 1997. Information compiled by
HMG/MOH and the WHO through a new Early Warning Reporting System, from
1997-98 indicate an increase in disease reports in late July, which peaked
in August / September, and returned to zero by mid October. Acute serum
samples sent for serology in 1998 identified JE IgM in about 50%. The
disease occurs throughout the Terai, with more than 11.5 million people
estimated to be at risk. The areas primarily affected appear to be those in
the Terai inhabited by people who raise pigs. However, cases have been
reported in Kathmandu.
In 1999 the epidemic began about two weeks early (in early July) and by the
end of August, appears to be larger than in 1992. This is attributed to an
early start to the monsoon rains. By the end of August there have been more
that 1100 cases and over 170 deaths reported to the MOH from all regions
in the Terai.
In past years there have been sporadic localized immunization campaigns,
using the killed Biken mouse brain vaccine, carried out by international
eleemosynary [charitable organizations, but no follow-up has been
reported. On 9 June 1999, the HMG/Ministry of Health received a donation
of 225 000 doses of the live SA14-14-2 vaccine prepared in primary hamster
kidney cells, presented by the ambassador of South Korea... The vaccine
has been administered to 170 000 children between the ages of one to 15 in
one district and the remainder is being distributed in several other
heavily affected district in the Terai." - Mod.CHC
