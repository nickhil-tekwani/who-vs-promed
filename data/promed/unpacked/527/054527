For almost 6 days, a girl's parents wondered why her fever did not come down despite taking medicines including some expensive antibiotics. Last week, she died at Apollo Hospitals following multiorgan failure.

It was only when a doctor at the intensive care unit noticed a tiny black scar on her thigh that she determined that her disease was scrub typhus, a rare zoonotic disease (which can be transmitted from animals to humans). Doctors say the disease is curable using antibiotics, but it can get out of hand when diagnosis is delayed.

"[The girl] was referred to us very late," said a doctor. In December 2011, doctors saw at least 3 very sick children with scrub typhus. All of them had to be ventilated, and one of them required dialysis. "This is dengue season. There were 4 patients with dengue, but they weren't as sick. They were discharged in 3 days, but those with scrub typhus were here for at least a week," the doctor said.

[The following is excerpted from: Demma LJ, McQuiston JH, Nicholson WL, et al. Scrub typhus, Republic of Palau. Emerg Infect Dis. 2006; 12(2): 290-5. Available at http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/content/12/2/pdfs/v12-n2.pdf:

"Scrub typhus is a zoonotic illness caused by _Orientia tsutsugamushi_. The pathogen is transmitted through the bite of larval mites (chiggers) of the _Trombiculidae_ family, which serve as both the vector and the reservoir (1,2). Rodents of the family _Muridae_ (rats and mice) are common hosts for trombiculid mites and may support _O. tsutsugamushi_. Geographically specific foci of scrub typhus are thus determined by the distribution of vector mites and their rodent hosts and by interactions of mites and rodents with humans (3). Scrub typhus has been reported from many regions of Asia and the Pacific islands, and known disease-endemic regions extend from Japan and eastern Russia southward to Australia and westward to Pakistan and Afghanistan (4,5).

"Scrub typhus is typically a nonspecific febrile illness; its severity may be influenced by the strain of _O. tsutsugamushi_, a person's immune status, and other factors. Diagnosis may be complicated in areas where the disease has not been documented recently or in regions lacking the capacity for laboratory confirmation. Illness develops after an incubation period of 6 to 21 days and usually begins with an eschar at the site of a chigger bite. Fever, headache, [lymphadenopathy], and myalgias are common, and a maculopapular rash may also be present. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or lower respiratory symptoms can also occur. Manifestations such as pneumonitis, meningoencephalitis, jaundice, renal failure, and myocarditis can develop during the prolonged clinical course of untreated illness (6). Establishing the diagnosis and initiating prompt antimicrobial drug therapy are important, because death rates for untreated scrub typhus patients are 1-30 per cent (5). Scrub typhus is effectively treated with doxycycline, and treatment should begin immediately upon suspicion of illness without awaiting laboratory confirmation."

Rodents may serve as reservoirs, although transovarial transmission in mites is the dominant mechanism for maintenance of _O. tsutsugamushi_ (http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol9no12/03-0212.htm). Humans become infected when they accidentally encroach in an area where the chigger-rodent cycle is occurring, most often areas of low-lying scrub brush or transitional vegetation.

Patients with severe scrub typhus can develop multiorgan failure and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy with hemorrhage.

Chennai (formerly known as Madras), is the capital city of the Indian state of Tamil Nadu, located on the Coromandel Coast of the Bay of Bengal. Chennai is the 4th most populous metropolitan area and the 5th most populous city in India. A map of India showing the state of Tamil Nadu can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/r/1ob7. - Mod.ML]
