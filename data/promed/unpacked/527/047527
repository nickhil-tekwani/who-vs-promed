Another 11 hepatitis A cases were registered in Estonia from 14 to 20
Nov 2011. Eight were in Viljandi county and the rest in Harju and
Parnu counties, according to the Health Board.

Since the beginning of this year [2011], 124 people have been
infected, with the largest outbreak being in Viljandi county, where a
total of 92 cases have been registered.

Prior to 2011, incidents of hepatitis A in Estonia were relatively
rare, with most cases found among recent immigrants. In 2010, the
number of people infected with the disease had leveled off at 6.

[Professor Norman Noah's comment in the preceding post in this thread
remains appropriate, namely: "These are extremely difficult outbreaks
to control." There is still no information regarding the age
distribution of their cases nor their social background.

The 1st case in Viljandi was reported in February 2011, and then the
number of cases increased dramatically in late August 2011.

Viljandi is a town and municipality in southern central Estonia with a
population of 19 150 (2011). It is the capital of Viljandi county. Its
location can be found in the map at:
