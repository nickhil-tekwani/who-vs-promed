Hepatitis A, vaccine withdrawal - EU 20011205.2952
[Several ProMED-mail subscribers working predominantly in Travel Clinics in
the USA, Africa and Australia have questioned the accuracy of the
Eurosurveillance Weekly Report, posted as "Hepatitis A, vaccine withdrawal
- EU 20011205.2952" (To be re-titled "Hepatitis A vaccine - EU: recall" -
Mod.ES). The general impression was that the VAQTA vaccine is produced only
by Merck and not by Aventis Pasteur. In fact the vaccines VAQTA for adults
and VAQTA K for children are marketed in Europe by Aventis Pasteur MSD,
which is a joint venture between Aventis Pasteur (Lyon) and Merck (New
Jersey) set up in 1994. As the report below indicates, it is likely that
the problem affects only batches of pre-filled syringes prepared and
distributed in Europe. - Mod.CP

Aventis Pasteur MSD recalls hepatitis vaccine
---------------------------------------------
Aventis Pasteur MSD, the European vaccines joint venture set up by Merck
and Aventis, announced the recall of all stocks of its VAQTA hepatitis A
vaccine this week because of concerns that it might not be potent enough.
The firm said the withdrawal involves pre-filled syringes of VAQTA vaccine
for adults and VAQTA K for children. The vaccine is made by Merck and
loaded into syringes in the UK by Evans Vaccines, part of Powderject.
A spokesman for the joint venture said: "The problem is an apparent
reduction in the potency of the vaccine, but only in a fraction of the
syringes." However, because of the difficulty of identifying which syringes
were affected, it was decided to recall every batch. A spokesman for
Powderject said the exact nature of the problem was not clear. "All of the
processes that we use are all fully agreed by Merck before we use them," he
said. Ralf Ehret, commercial director of Aventis Pasteur MSD's German
unit, said 532 000 doses of the vaccine, worth 12 million euros, were sold
in Europe in 2000.

Hepatitis A vaccine
-------------------
The hepatitis A vaccines 'VAQTA Paediatric' and 'VAQTA Adult' marketed by
Aventis Pasteur MSD are being recalled because of decreased potency in some
syringes. This applies to all batches of vaccine currently within their
expiry date. Previous batches (including those marketed under their generic
name "Hepatitis A vaccine, purified, inactivated, for adults") that have
now expired may also have been affected.
The Medicines Control Agency has issued a Class II Drug alert,
co-ordinating this action with all other Member States of the EU, stating
that the company is recalling all batches of VAQTA currently on the market.
It is possible that patients who have received these vaccines since their
launch in 1997 and 1998 respectively may not have adequate and continuing
protection against infection with hepatitis A.
As a precautionary measure, for anyone at continuing risk of hepatitis A
who has been immunised with VAQTA products only, it is recommended that
those individuals: - who have previously been immunised with these products
should start their immunisation schedule again with another hepatitis A
vaccine product; - who have been immunised with one of these products in
anticipation of travelling to areas of increased endemicity for hepatitis A
in the near future, for example for a "winter sun" holiday, should be
re-immunised immediately, with another product. Hepatitis A vaccine is
effective prevention even if given immediately before departure; - who have
received both a VAQTA product and another hepatitis A vaccine product as
part of their immunisation should, for continuing protection, receive a
further dose of another hepatitis A vaccine product. A period of at least 6
months should have elapsed between the 2 doses of these other vaccines.
Individuals who have received VAQTA products can be reassured that the
vaccine is not being recalled for reasons of safety.
