Montreal public health officials say they are investigating a deadly case of legionnaires' disease in the city's east end to see if it is linked to 2 other cases detected in the area. The city's public health department said today that the investigation will target water cooling towers in the area. The victim was only identified as a man.

Last year [2021], 2 people died after an outbreak of legionnaires' disease in an adjacent area.

The public health department says 27 cases of legionnaires' disease, which is caused by bacteria [_Legionella_], have been detected in the city [Montreal] so far this year [2022], and that 52 cases were detected last year [2021].

The disease can cause fever, cough, shortness of breath and aches and pains, and it can be fatal in roughly 10 to 15% of cases.

[Quebec is a province in eastern Canada. A map of Quebec regions can be found at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_regions_of_Quebec.html. Montreal (pop., over 1.7 million residents in 2021) is the 2nd-most populous city in Canada and the most populous city in Quebec. A map showing the location of Montreal can be found at https://www.google.com/maps/place/Montreal,+QC,+Canada.

The news article reports 3 cases of Legionnaires' disease in Montreal's east end. We will await the results of genotyping clinical isolates of _Legionella_. Genotyping the isolates from patients with legionnaires' disease will help establish whether this is a common source outbreak if the genotypes match. However, if the diagnosis of legionnaires' disease was based only on a positive urinary antigen assay, there will be no clinical isolates for genotyping. Matching the genotypes of clinical isolates, if available, and environmental isolates of _Legionella_ will identify the environmental source responsible for the individual cases.

More information from knowledgeable sources on this cluster of legionnaires' disease cases in Montreal, Canada would be appreciated. - Mod.ML
