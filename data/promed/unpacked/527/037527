Wildlife rabies cases on the rise [in Florida
-------------------------------------
In Florida, the number of confirmed rabies cases in [wild animals has been
on a steady decline since 1996. But in Palm Beach County, there already
have been almost as many confirmed rabies cases so far this year as in all
of 2000. Broward County also has seen an increase in the number of
confirmed cases, said Allan Siegel, marketing manager for the Broward
County Animal Care and Regulation Division. In the past 12 months, there
have been 8 confirmed cases of rabid animals. In previous years, county
officials have seen at most 2 cases each year.
In intensively developed Miami-Dade County, the last reported rabies case
was in 1998.
The numbers, though seemingly small, are enough to raise eyebrows in the
public health community. So much so that in Broward County, visitors to
Tree Top Park in Davie are greeted by a large banner warning horse owners
to have their animals vaccinated against the disease. County officials
there also have gone door-to-door after a rabies case, telling residents to
look for stray domestic animals.
Rabies among wildlife has become more prevalent since the 1950s, accounting
for 85 percent of animal rabies cases, according to the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention. Unless cornered, most wild animals will run from
humans. But a rabid animal will attack without provocation. [Various
examples are given in this report. - Mod.MHJ
"Normally, a fox or a raccoon would have nothing to do with a human,"
Priscilla Stockner, director of Palm Beach County Animal Care & Control,
said. "The fact that we see so many more wildlife now than before is
because of development. If we destroy their habitat they must move and in
that transfer they may interact with the human population." Health
officials also point to the drought, which is sending some animals in
search of new water sources, and on South Florida's tolerance for feral
animals, especially cats.
State health officials say they don't have any definitive answers for the
higher-than-normal numbers of rabies cases. Lisa Conti, state public health
veterinarian, said the virus could be infecting more animals than before.
Also, there have been more reported cases of rabid cats than dogs. "Part of
[the reason is the tolerance for feral cats," Conti said. "[People are
feeding them, but they're really not taking care of their health. We
definitely discourage the feeding of wild animals."
In some cases, it's not just the cats that are being fed. Other wild
animals are attracted to the easy food some people leave under bushes or
outside office complexes, potentially setting up a bad encounter between a
wild animal and a human. Such incidents, while not everyday, are not
unheard-of occurrences in suburban communities where undeveloped land gives
way to subdivisions and strip malls. As wild animal habitat continues to be
destroyed, animal and human contact increases. When an animal is rabid,
that contact becomes more perilous.

[This is a very urbicentric report, in that natural habitat/farmland is
referred to as undeveloped. In properly conducted feral cat programs, they
are trapped, castrated/spayed, vaccinated, ear-cropped, and released back
to the area where they are being fed. It works well in controlling numbers
and maintains their health. But if you are feeding feral cats you are
probably also feeding raccoons, which hang around getting fatter and fatter
and knocking over the garbage/trash cans. People in south Florida would be
wise to make sure that their dogs, cats, and horses are up to date on their
rabies vaccinations. - Mod.MHJ
