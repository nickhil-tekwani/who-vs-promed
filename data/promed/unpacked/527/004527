A poultry worker is suffering from conjunctivitis after contracting the H7
strain of bird flu, the Health Protection Agency (HPA) has confirmed. The
person was infected through close contact with birds at the Witford Lodge
Farm in North Tuddenham, Norfolk, which had the disease. H7 has no
relationship to the deadly H5N1 strain which has killed over 100 people,
mainly in South Asia.
The Health Protection Agency said the worker has no other symptoms. It
added that the worker, who does not want to be named, has the H7N3 strain
of avian influenza which is not highly infectious and last seen in the UK
in 1979.
The worker has not required hospital treatment. He or she was given the
antiviral drug Tamiflu as a precautionary measure on Thu 27 Apr 2006 as
soon as the HPA was told about the outbreak.
The strain is not easily passed from poultry to people, or from person to
person, the HPA said. "In almost all cases of human H7 infection to date,
the virus has only caused a mild disease," it said in a statement.
"Therefore, the risk to the general public in this outbreak is extremely
limited."
Conjunctivitis causes red, sore, itchy eyes and the worker has no
respiratory symptoms. To date, most human cases of H7 avian influenza have
presented with conjunctivitis only.
An unconfirmed number of other workers are already taking the same drug to
prevent the illness. They are also being offered the seasonal flu jab to
prevent the H7 virus from mixing with any human flu viruses that may be
circulating. Nose and throat swabs and blood tests are also being taken
from the other workers, and their health is being closely monitored. Close
contacts of the infected worker are also being given advice and
preventative medication as appropriate.
Dr Jonathan Van Tam, a flu expert at the HPA, said: "It is important to
remember that H7 avian flu remains largely a disease of birds. The virus
does not transmit easily to humans, as evidenced by the small number of
confirmed infections worldwide to date. Almost all human H7 infections
documented so far have been associated with close contact with dead or
dying poultry. The threat to human health posed by H7 avian influenza
viruses remains very low despite the recent developments in Norfolk."
Alan Hay, director of the Medical Research Council's World Influenza
Centre, said: "These sporadic human infections do happen in the case of H7
when people are in very close contact with birds. "You have to keep this in
context; people in close contact have to take sensible precautions such as
wearing eye masks and gloves but this is not an infection that other people
should be concerned about catching."
The Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs confirmed that
the 34 000 birds on the infected farm will still be slaughtered, and a 1-km
exclusion zone will remain in place. The World Health Organization says not
all H5 or H7 strains are severe, but their ability to mutate means their
presence is "always a cause for concern".

[The largest and most significant previous outbreak of H7-type avian
influenza occurred in the Netherlands in 2003, associated with an H7N7 HPAI
virus probably derived from wild ducks. A total of 453 people reported with
health complaints, predominantly conjunctivitis. Antibodies were found in
59 per cent of infected poultry workers' family members. Of about 500
tested persons who had handled infected poultry, about 50 per cent showed
an antibody response. It was possible that the poultry farmers and workers
complied insufficiently with the preventive measures.
The antiviral drug oseltamivir was considered protective against infection,
whereas mouth and nose masks were not. The attention to support,
information and respectful treatment of poultry farmers and workers during
the clearances worked quite well. Externally hired veterinarians
experienced their activities as emotionally aggravating more often than
other professionals. A veterinarian involved in the culling operations
died, but his death was considered to be unconnected with the H7N7
outbreak. - Mod.CP]
