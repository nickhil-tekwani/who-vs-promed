Two people died while scores were hospitalized in a remote Cagayan
village in what authorities said was a case of ingesting contaminated
animal meat at the weekend [27-28 Feb 2010]. Doctors at the Cagayan
Provincial Hospital feared the deaths might have been caused by
anthrax bacteria following reports that residents in San Pedro
village in Lasam town had been downed after eating spoiled meat.

Cagayan health officer Danilo Alonzo confirmed that 2 residents from
the village had died, while his deputy, Carlos Cortina, said about
150 more had been hospitalized as of last Friday [26 Feb 2010] and
were under close monitoring by medical personnel. "The spread [of the
disease] has developed into epidemic proportions but we are now doing
all we can to contain the situation," Alonzo said on Sunday [28 Feb 2010].

The names and ages of the victims were not yet available, but Cortina
told GMANews.TV the investigation by the Cagayan health office had
found that the victims had all consumed meat from a dead carabao.
"This incident is not new in the area considering that the same kind
of bacterium has infected several residents of the same town last
year [2009]," Cortina said, adding that they were still verifying the
diagnosis since determining the real cause of the deaths was not easy.

"We already sent out advisories as early as last year [209] that the
public should not eat meat of dead animals because the bacteria stay
in the soil for a long time and both grazing and gnawing animals are
easily infected by the anthrax spore," he said.

Patients infected with anthrax, caused by _Bacillus anthracis_, have
been rushed to the Lasam General Hospital and Cagayan Valley Medical
Center in Tuguegarao City. Cortina said the patients and villagers
had been given anti-anthrax medications, antibiotics, and other
medicines, while Governor Antonio Alvaro had announced that the
provincial government was ready to release funds to mitigate the
spread of anthrax.

Health officials traced the problem to poverty or lack of available
food, noting that the poor get victimized by profiteers who sell
cheap meat from unknown sources. Meanwhile, Alonzo said the
provincial veterinary office was already on alert as farm animals in
areas suspected of infection were "being butchered and buried immediately."

[Cagayan is a province in the NE corner of Luzon Island, which is a
chronically affected part of the Philippines, where carabao (are
regularly affected. Unfortunately pre-emptive slaughter of possible
anthrax cases tends to not encourage owner reporting and can merely
increase the flow of infected meat into markets unless there is
effective and efficient owner compensation. Surveillance and
proactive targeted annual vaccination is a more cost-effective
control process. To find Cagayan go to
