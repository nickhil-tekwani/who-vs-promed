[1] Diarrhea, fatal - Pakistan (Federally Administered Tribal Areas)

At least 7 people including women and children died and dozens others
were hospitalized after diarrhea broke out in Tirah Valley of Khyber
Agency. According to local sources, due to contaminated water and
unhygienic conditions, epidemics like diarrhea broke out in far flung
and militancy-hit Tirah Valley.

Due to the outbreak of the epidemic and absence of appropriate medical
treatment, 7 people including women and children have died during the
past 2 days. Meanwhile, dozens of other diarrhea patients were shifted
to different hospitals. Most of the hospitals in the troubled area
were closed due to militants' activities and security forces' action,
and there was no staff in the hospitals and Basic Health Units (BHU).

Local sources said that several affected people were in critical
condition as there was no facility of medical treatment in the area.
The dwellers of Tirah Valley have demanded the provincial and federal
government to send doctors' teams and medicines to the affected areas
to stop the further spread of the epidemic.

Out of the 283 suspected cholera cases in rain-hit areas of Sindh, 24
have been confirmed positive, and 3 people have died due to the
disease so far, the WHO said in its report issued on Sunday evening,
18 Sep 2011.

"Between a month's period (16 Aug to 15 Sep 2011), the DEWS detected
225 alerts, out of which 42 were confirmed outbreaks, and the Rapid
Response Team responded to all reported outbreaks within 48 hours, and
among these, 35 were attributed to acute watery diarrhea," the DEWS
said in the report. "In the last few days, the WHO distributed health
kits, essential medicines and medical supplies to cover the needs of a
population of about a quarter million," the report quoted WHO
representative Dr Guido Sabatinelli as saying.

[3] Possible cholera - Uzbekistan (Tashkent)
Date: Fri 16 Sep 2011

Through its media service, Jahon, the Uzbek foreign ministry appears
to be denying claims that Uzbekistan is experiencing an outbreak of
cholera. The ministry of health in Uzbekistan and the state
epidemiological surveillance unit are also refuting reports of a
cholera outbreak.

"If we announce a cholera diagnosis, then we immediately have to
organise quarantine, and nobody wants that," said one doctor in the
Tinchlik village hospital in Yangiyul district, Tashkent. Quarantine,
he says, means that villages and towns where cholera has been
identified have to be "shut down," and clean drinking water has to be
supplied, which is an extremely costly operation for the district
authorities, especially in villages like Tinchlik."

"We haven't had clean water for 20 years. The old water pipes have
crumbled, but nobody has ever replaced them," said Akramkhodzh
Mukhiddinov, member of the Human Rights Alliance of Uzbekistan (PAU)
and also a resident of Tinchlik.

Mukhiddinov claims that many people who have their own transport bring
drinking water from Yangiyul or Tashkent, but most people take water
from waterways running through the area.

"People take water from the irrigation channels, then boil it and
drink it. There is no alternative when there is no clean mains water,"
says Mukhiddinov. He claims that people most at risk of contracting
cholera are those who take water from the Boz-Su river. "A 45-year-old
man, who drank water from this river, died recently in our village,"
Mukhiddinov says.

Meanwhile, Uzbekistan's health ministry and foreign affairs ministry
are categorically denying reports of a cholera outbreak.

"When you present them with concrete facts about people dying from an
illness, the symptoms of which are extremely similar to those of
cholera, ministry of health civil servants don't respond, claiming
that they have heard of no such instances," one Tashkent journalist
remarked.

Uzbekistan's state epidemiological service also denies the outbreak of
cholera.

"We are currently running a campaign to vaccinate children against
measles and German measles, but have heard nothing about cholera. If
there were cases, we would have made statements about this," said one
employee of the state epidemiological surveillance service in
Chilanzar district, Tashkent.

"The symptoms of cholera, vomiting and diarrhea, are similar to those
of other intestinal illnesses, and it is possible that people are
mistaken about what is actually wrong," an employee of the
epidemiological surveillance unit speculated. When asked about
cholera, the source asked us not to use his name.

Despite official denials, many doctors are saying confidentially that
there are cases of cholera now in Uzbekistan. They do not hide the
fact that people have died from an intestinal illness, the name of
which doctors will not spell out to their relatives.

"I am convinced my husband died of cholera after he swam in the Boz-Su
river," said a 30-year-old Tashkent resident.

The outbreak of cholera would appear to be confirmed, at least, by
events in Yangiyul district and in Yangiyul hospital, where, in
mid-August 2011, dozens of people arrived each day with symptoms of
this disease, not only vomiting and diarrhea but also severe
dehydration. Previously, the Almazarsk district of Tashkent had
experienced cholera-like illness, also linked to water from the Boz-Su
river.

[4] Possible cholera - Uzbekistan (Tashkent)
Date: Fri 9 Sep 2011

An epidemic of an unknown disease with symptoms of cholera has been
raging for over 20 days in the town of Yangiyol in Uzbekistan's
Tashkent Region [near the capital Tashkent].

A Ferghana correspondent on 8 Sep 2011 visited Yangiyol to check the
validity of the rumours about a possible epidemic of cholera in the
town. Announcements are posted on the doors of practically all cafes
and shops calling on the locals to thoroughly wash their hands before
eating meals, fruits and vegetables, and to drink only boiled water.

Doctors at the Yangiyol hospital did not comment on what type of
enteric disease has affected so many people or mention the name of the
disease. However, one of the medical staff on condition of anonymity
said that starting from 15 Aug 2011, several dozen people have been
taken to the hospital every day with symptoms of the disease.

"Their ages range from small children to mature men and women. All
were in a grave condition, could not walk or even stand, and had
constant diarrhea and vomiting. The whole hospital stank of rotten
fish. The nurses constantly washed them," he said.

According to the source, the doctors were banned from diagnosing [the
disease] as cholera. "A woman from Xalqobod [a settlement in the town]
with the same symptoms by herself went to a clinic of infectious
diseases in Tashkent city, where she was immediately diagnosed with
cholera," he said.

He said that towards the end of August 2011, more and more sick people
were admitted every day. "It reached a peak on 31 Aug 2011: 70 people
with similar symptoms were taken to the hospital. Only the existing
staff worked at the hospital those days. No one was sent in to help,
only those who were on leave or sick leave were called in to work,"
the hospital staff member complained.

The majority of the patients are residents of Xalqobod. "The Bozsuv
canal flows there, and many [of the patients] had swum in it. Some had
washed dishes and some their hands," the source explained.
