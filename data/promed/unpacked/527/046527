Introduced diseases - Solomon Islands: RFI 970303170858]
I can't help with information specific to the Solomon Islands, but two
excellent resources describing (and speculating) on the effects of introduced
exotic diseases to Hawai'i are:
The Gifts of Civilization: Germs and Genocide in Hawai'i
O. A. Bushnell
University of Hawai'i Press, 1993
Before the Horror: The Population of Hawai'i on the Eve of Western
Contact
David E. Stannard
University of Hawai'i Press, 1989
Hope this helps!
