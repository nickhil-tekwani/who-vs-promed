Monterey woman's death was from dengue fever
-----------------------------------------
A 28-year-old Monterey County woman died of mosquito-borne dengue fever in May
2005, shortly after returning from a visit to Mexico, state health officials
confirmed Thursday.
She became seriously ill with severe body aches, fever and chills on the last
day of a family trip to Chacalapa in the state of Guerrero and died 9 May 2005.
Tests show she died of dengue hemorrhagic fever, the most severe form of the
illness. Dengue fever is caused by a virus carried by the _Aedes aegypti_
mosquito, which is not found in California.
The woman's 5-year-old daughter and 26-year-old sister, who traveled with her
to Mexico, were also diagnosed with mild forms of the illness. A 72-year-old
family acquaintance from Monterey County who was visiting the same area of
Mexico also contracted dengue fever and has since recovered.
The state recorded 2 imported cases of dengue fever in 2004, 6 in 2003, and 2
in 2002.

The Secretariat of Health Surveillance (SVS in the Portuguese language
abbreviation) of the Ministry of Health registered in 2005, 107 575 notified
cases (Table 1 at the URL above).
There has been an increase of 30 per cent in the period January-May 2005
compared to the same period in 2004 (79 674 cases) (Table 2).
8 states have shown a reduction in the case total (comapred to 2004), while 19
states have shown an increase, bearing in mind that the states of Maranhao,
Mato Grosso & Sergipe have only very preliminary data for May 2005.
The autochthonous circulation of dengue virus serotypes 1, 2 & 3 has been
identified in 24 states or federal units (Figure 1). In Rondonia state (only)
types 1 & 3 have been found, while the states of Santa Catarina & Rio Grande do
Sul remain without autochthonous cases of dengue [these are the most southern
states of Brazil. - Mod.JW].
At the moment, 72 cases of DHF with 5 deaths have been confirmed.
