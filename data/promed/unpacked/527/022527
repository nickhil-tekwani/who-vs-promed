An Iraqi teenager, whose death from a fever raised fears that avian
influenza had spread to the country, did not have the lethal virus, a
spokesman for the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Thu 19 Jan 2006.
"It has been investigated and discounted. It is not an H5N1 avian influenza
case," spokesman Dick Thompson told Reuters.
Iraqi health officials said the teenager, who died on Tue 17 Jan 2006 after
a 2 week illness, lived close to a lake that is a haven for migratory birds
flying south from Turkey, where 21 people have been confirmed this month as
having [contracted H5N1 avian influenza virus infection].
