Situation in numbers: (total and new cases in last 24 hours)
-----------------------------------
Globally 14 557 confirmed (2604 new)
China 14 411 confirmed (2590 new) 2110 severe (315 new) 304 deaths (45 new)
Outside of China 146 confirmed (14 new) 23 countries 1 death

WHO Risk Assessment
----------------------------
China Very High
Regional Level High
Global Level High
- No new countries have reported cases of 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease in the last 24 hours.
WHO is receiving information about cases from a number of countries. As additional details become known, WHO requests countries to share information in a timely manner as specified in the guidance on Global Surveillance for human infection with novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).
- The 1st death has been reported outside of China, in the Philippines. The patient was a close contact of the 1st patient confirmed in the Philippines.
- Due to the high demand for timely and trustworthy information about 2019-nCoV, WHO technical risk communication and social media teams have been working closely to track and respond to myths and rumours.

Risk communication and community engagement
Managing the 2019-nCoV "infodemic"
-----------------
The 2019-nCoV outbreak and response has been accompanied by a massive "infodemic" -- an over-abundance of information, some accurate and some not -- that makes it hard for people to find trustworthy sources and reliable guidance when they need it. Due to the high demand for timely and trustworthy information about 2019-nCoV, WHO technical risk communication and social media teams have been working closely to track and respond to myths and rumours. Through its headquarters in Geneva, its 6 regional offices and its partners, the Organization is working 24 hours a day to identify the most prevalent rumours that can potentially harm the public's health, such as false prevention measures or cures. These myths are then refuted with evidence-based information. WHO is making public health information and advice on the 2019-nCoV, including MythBusters, available on its social media channels (including Weibo, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Pinterest) and website.

Country risk communication and community engagement (RCCE) preparedness and response
----------------
Country risk communication and community engagement (RCCE) are a critical public health intervention in all countries. Countries should prepare to communicate rapidly, regularly and transparently with the population. All countries should prepare existing public health communication networks, media and community engagement staff to be ready for a possible case, and for the appropriate response if this happens. Countries should coordinate communications with other response organizations and include the community in response operations. WHO stands ready to coordinate with partners to support countries in their communication and community engagement response.

Ensuring a people-centered response to 2019-nCoV
---------------------
An expanding group of global response organizations such as the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) are coordinating efforts with WHO to ensure that biomedical recommendations can be applied at the community level. These organizations are active at the global, regional, and country levels to ensure that affected populations have a voice and are part of the response. Ensuring that global recommendations and communication are tested, adapted and localized will help countries better control the 2019-nCoV outbreak.

Preparedness and Response
- WHO has developed a protocol for the investigation of early cases (the "First Few X (FFX) Cases and contact investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection"). The protocol is designed to gain an early understanding of the key clinical, epidemiological and virological characteristics of the 1st cases of 2019-nCoV infection detected in any individual country, to inform the development and updating of public health guidance to manage cases and reduce potential spread and impact of infection. WHO has been in regular and direct contact with Member States where cases have been reported. WHO is also informing other countries about the situation and providing support as requested.

WHO has developed interim guidance for laboratory diagnosis, advice on the use of masks during home care and in health care settings in the context of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, clinical management, infection prevention and control in health care settings, home care for patients with suspected novel coronavirus, risk communication and community engagement and Global Surveillance for human infection with novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).

WHO has prepared a disease commodity package that includes an essential list of biomedical equipment, medicines and supplies necessary to care for patients with 2019-nCoV.

WHO has provided recommendations to reduce risk of transmission from animals to humans.
WHO has published updated advice for international travel in relation to the outbreak of the novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV.

WHO has activated an R&D blueprint to accelerate diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics.

WHO has developed an online course to provide general introduction to emerging respiratory viruses, including novel coronaviruses.

WHO is providing guidance on early investigations, which are critical to carry out early in an outbreak of a new virus. The data collected from the protocols can be used to refine recommendations for surveillance and case definitions, to characterize the key epidemiological transmission features of 2019-nCoV, help understand spread, severity, spectrum of disease, impact on the community, and to inform operational models for implementation of countermeasures such as case isolation, contact tracing and isolation. Several protocols are available here: https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/early-investigations.

Strategic Objectives
-----------
WHO's strategic objectives for this response are to:
- Limit human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts and health care workers, preventing transmission amplification events, and preventing further international spread from China*;
- Identify, isolate and care for patients early, including providing optimized care for infected patients;
- Identify and reduce transmission from the animal source;
- Address crucial unknowns regarding clinical severity, extent of transmission and infection, treatment options, and accelerate the development of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines;
- Communicate critical risk and event information to all communities and counter misinformation;
- Minimize social and economic impact through multisectoral partnerships.*This can be achieved through a combination of public health measures, such as rapid identification, diagnosis and management of the cases, identification and follow up of the contacts, infection prevention and control in healthcare settings, implementation of health measures for travellers, awareness-raising in the population, and risk communication.
- WHO is working with its networks of researchers and other experts to coordinate global work on surveillance, epidemiology, modelling, diagnostics, clinical care and treatment, and other ways to identify and manage the disease and limit onward transmission. WHO has issued interim guidance for countries, which are updated regularly.
- WHO is working with global expert networks and partnerships for laboratory infection prevention and control, clinical management, and mathematical modelling.

Recommendations and Advice for The Public
---------------
During previous outbreaks due to other coronaviruses (Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)), human-to-human transmission occurred through droplets, contact and fomites, suggesting that the transmission mode of the 2019-nCoV may be similar. The basic principles to reduce the general risk of transmission of acute respiratory infections include the following: Avoiding close contact with people suffering from acute respiratory infections; Frequent hand-washing, especially after direct contact with ill people or their environment; Avoiding unprotected contact with farm or wild animals; People with symptoms of acute respiratory infection should practice cough etiquette (maintain distance, cover coughs and sneezes with disposable tissues or clothing, and wash hands); Within healthcare facilities, enhance standard infection prevention and control practices in hospitals, especially in emergency departments.

WHO does not recommend any specific health measures for travellers. In case of symptoms suggestive of respiratory illness either during or after travel, travellers are encouraged to seek medical attention and share their travel history with their healthcare providers.

On the evening of 1 Feb 2020, according to the Shenzhen Third People's Hospital, the Institute of Liver Disease Research of the hospital found that 2019-nCoV nucleic acid (new coronavirus) was positive in the stools of certain patients with pneumonia diagnosed with the new coronavirus. It is likely to indicate the presence of live virus in the stool.

According to researchers at Shenzhen Third People's Hospital, researchers are currently conducting research on further virus isolation. Citizens are reminded to wash their hands frequently while wearing a mask and to pay attention to personal hygiene.

Recently, some media reported that the stool of patients with confirmed new-type coronavirus pneumonia in Shenzhen was positive for nucleic acid in stool, and the virus is at risk of fecal-oral transmission.

Academician Yi Zhongnanshan pointed out in an interview with CCTV reporters on this issue that some patients' fecal nucleic acid test is a fact and should be paid close attention to. If the virus is really isolated, the possibility of fecal-oral transmission increases.

What is the difference between nucleic acid isolation and virus isolation?

Zhong Zhongshan: Isolating a virus means that there is a live virus, and a nucleic acid is a nucleic acid. If the virus is isolated, it means that there is a coronavirus in the stool, then the problem is even greater.

Isolated nucleic acid does not mean there is a virus, does it?

Zhong Zhongshan: These are 2 concepts. Nucleic acid is a sequence of (virus), suggesting that it may be, but the actual isolation of live virus is another matter.

Chinese Premier Li Keqiang on Sunday [2 Feb 2020] called for all-out efforts to improve the allocation of key medical supplies such as protective suits and facial masks, especially for medical workers on the front-line. The Chinese government vowed to "severely" deal with those who hiked prices, or hoard and profiteer from such goods.

Medical equipment has been in severe shortage in Wuhan and other virus-hit areas. Production of medical supplies are currently at 60 percent after an early resumption of the manufacturing during the holiday, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology said Sunday [2 Feb 2020].
