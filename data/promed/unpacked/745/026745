Ebola response roadmap - Situation report 10 Dec 2014
-----------------------------------------------------
Highlights
----------
- There have been 17 942 reported cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD), with 6388 reported deaths [as of 7 Dec 2014 (3 Dec in Liberia)].
[This is an increase of 797 cases and 318 deaths in a week (many unconfirmed). - Mod.JW]
- Case incidence is slightly increasing in Guinea, decreasing in Liberia, and may be increasing or stable in Sierra Leone.
- Sierra Leone now has the highest total number of reported cases of the 3 intense-transmission countries, with 7897 cases reported to date.
- At national level, Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone have sufficient capacity to isolate and treat all reported EVD cases, and bury all EVD-related deaths safely and with dignity.
***However, local variations mean capacity is still insufficient in some areas. [emphasis added - ProMED]

[2] Sierra Leone: lockdown in eastern mining district
Date: Wed 10 Dec 2014

Ebola lockdown in eastern Sierra Leone mining district
------------------------------------------------------
Sierra Leone authorities imposed a 2-week lockdown on the eastern diamond mining district of Kono [Wed 10 Dec 2014] after 8 new cases of Ebola were confirmed in 1 day. The lockdown will limit residents' movements until [Tue 23 Dec 2014]. The decision to impose a lockdown was taken at a meeting of traditional rulers known as the Council of Paramount Chiefs, its chairman Paul Saquee told reporters.

The WHO said investigators sent to the remote Kono district last week found Ebola patients dying in a hospital unequipped to deal with the virus. It said in 11 days, teams had buried 87 bodies, including a nurse, an ambulance driver and a janitor who had removed bodies from the hospital as they piled up. As of [Tue 9 Dec 2014], the Kono district, with a population of 350 000, officially had 123 confirmed cases of Ebola. But the director of disease control for Sierra Leone's health ministry, Dr. Amara Jambai, suggested that number was far too low.

Olu Olushayo, the WHO's coordinator in Sierra Leone, said Sierra Leone officials, the US Centers for Disease Control [and Prevention -- CDC] and other organizations were sending staff and equipment to Kono. It said the International Red Cross would quickly build a new Ebola treatment center and disinfect the hospital. The WHO national Ebola coordinator Olu Olushayo, said rapid reaction has so far helped contain the cases of Ebola virus to about half of the 15 chiefdoms in Kono.

Freelance journalist Emmanuel Lebbie said: "People are moving freely within towns and villages, but are not allowed to go beyond the district itself." Most people were remaining indoors and while shops were open, the markets were largely empty of consumers. Only essential vehicles such as fuel-carrying tankers, military, police, NGO workers and UN-associated vehicles were allowed through heavily monitored checkpoints into the district. Private and commercial vehicles and motor cycle taxis are barred, and mining activity has ceased, one mines monitor reported. ... -- more

[3] Sierra Leone: doctors strike settled

Junior Sierra Leone doctors on partial strike over Ebola protection
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Up to 8 Dec 2014, 106 medical personnel have died from Ebola in Sierra Leone, including 10 doctors, 3 of them as recently as last week. The doctors said they want a specialized Ebola unit equipped with a dialysis machine to treat them whenever they are infected by their patients and cannot be evacuated overseas. They also said they want an insurance policy. Sierra Leone's President Ernest Bai Koroma has assured junior doctors, who have been on a partial strike over the lack of proper care for local Ebola care givers, that their demands will be met.

Government spokesman Abdulai Bayraytay said President Koroma met [Tue 9 Dec 2014] with representatives of the Sierra Leone Doctors' Association and assured them their demands will be addressed immediately. Bayraytay said President Koroma told the doctors he appreciates their invaluable role in the fight against Ebola. "We, as a government, [have] already contacted the emergency hospitals. They have agreed that all that they (the doctors) have requested will be in the country around [17 Dec 2014]. The installation and everything will be up and running by [20 Dec 2014]," Bayraytay said.

Management of pregnant women infected with Ebola virus in a treatment centre in Guinea, June 2014
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Baggi FM, Taybi A, Kurth A, Van Herp M, Di Caro A, Wolfel R, Gunther S, Decroo T, Declerck H, Jonckheere S. Management of pregnant women infected with Ebola virus in a treatment centre in Guinea, June 2014. Euro Surveill. 2014;19(49):pii=20983. Date of submission: 25 Nov 2014]

We report 2 cases of confirmed Ebola virus disease in pregnant women, who presented at the Medecins Sans Frontieres Ebola treatment centre in Gueckedou [Guinea]. Despite the very high risk of death, both pregnant women survived. In both cases the critical decision was made to induce vaginal delivery. We raise a number of considerations regarding the management of Ebola virus-infected pregnant women, including the place of amniocentesis and induced delivery, and whether certain invasive medical acts are justified.
