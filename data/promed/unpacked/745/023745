The Ministry of Agriculture, Rural Development, Population and Territory has notified the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAPA) of a case of anthrax, which has affected a mare in the town of Navalvillar de Pela. In this case, the Junta de Extremadura is "in permanent contact" with the Ministry of Agriculture to deal with this matter, which is why it has launched an epidemiological surveillance plan and has made an emergency order to the Tragsatec company to carry out the monitoring of all incidents that may occur as a result of this case.

Likewise, the epidemiological surveys necessary to know the scope of the situation are being carried out, according to the Junta de Extremadura in a press release. As highlighted, this infection, caused by _Bacillus anthracis_, affects a large number of species, although it presents variable virulence and clinical symptoms.

Alfonso Rodriguez, a veterinarian from Navalvillar de Pela (Badajoz) has reported in COPE possible cases of anthrax in Las Vegas Altas del Guadiana and has confirmed that 3 people have "compatible symptoms", all mild and progressing favorably.

"One of them is a fellow veterinarian who performed a necropsy on an animal and is well, with skin lesions that are progressing favorably. The other 2 are the owners of a mare that also has symptoms compatible with anthrax," he explained on the COPE radio station chain.

In addition, he has detailed that in most cases there is a common nexus. "They are all around the N-430 and many of them are cattle or sheep owners or are around them."

Dr Rodriguez attended the 1st case detected in a horse from Navalvillar de Pela (Badajoz) and which was later confirmed as positive with anthrax at the Veterinary School of Caceres, as explained in COPE by Juan Enrique Perez, dean of the university center. No positives have been detected in the team of veterinarians from the Caceres Faculty that performed the necropsy on the equine, although all are under the supervision and control of the occupational health department.

In fact, Alfonso Rodr√≠guez himself has attended this Monday [6 Sep 2021] the death of 3 mares "that have fallen abruptly", a situation that this professional with 11 years of experience regrets. "In 11 years I have never experienced a horse being struck down and I could not do anything for them. It is something that consumes me from the inside," he said visibly affected in the microphones of COPE. "Today has been a horrible day, this morning they confirmed to me that a mare had been found dead and this afternoon another 2, in a sudden way".

Extremadura has activated the epidemiological alert after the appearance of several possible cases of anthrax in animals and humans, a disease caused by a bacterium that is contagious, acute, and serious.

The Ministry of Agriculture have confirmed that they have been sent for analysis "2 suspicious samples of animals to confirm this disease", declared "individualized and urgent" for the Extremaduran epidemiological surveillance network.

COPE has had access to the alert sent by the Don Benito - Villanueva de la Serena Health Area Management in which it is explained that this statement "must be made in the face of clinical and epidemiological suspicion, and diagnostic confirmation is not necessary for the declaration of the cases". This document was sent on September 4 [2021].

[So far these human and equine cases were diagnosed on clinical signs. Laboratory samples have presumably been taken and the results are awaited.
