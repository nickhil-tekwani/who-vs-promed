By the looks of the curve on the right [go to URL above], the rush of cases that defined the 3rd known outbreak of the low pathogenicity avian influenza A virus subtype, H7N9, is over... for another season anyway.

If we get into the nitty gritty, as I have below, there are a couple of interesting things to see. 1st though, let us remember that these are just reported data:

- There may have been some cases that were not reported for whatever political, medical, social or personal reasons; these data are an idea of what happened; look at the trends and don't get hung up on the specific values.

- The overwhelming majority of the cases have reported to a healthcare facility with respiratory disease due (presumably) to either infection; we have no idea how many other people have been infected, what proportion were mild or asymptomatic (as I've discussed here... so we know it is possible). It could be half as many again, or 100 or 1000 times as many.

- These are only cases that have been examined with a laboratory test (as far as we know); there may have been many other cases of "influenza-like illness" that did not get sampled and tested but were managed under (or not) the assumption that they were influenza of some type, subtype or strain.

The interesting stuff includes:
- For the 2 outbreaks we have continuous data for -- 2013-14 and 2014-15 -- the start of the outbreak seems to be around October/November, with the peak around January/February.

- Outbreak 3 did not seem to reach the heights of the preceding year; however, from what we could glean from pretty poor data, the link to poultry exposure was as strong as ever. Perhaps market closures in response to deaths were a little more effective/efficient/wide-ranging in outbreak 3? This is pure speculation.

- Most of the cases in 2015 (bottom maps at the URL above) were on the east coast of China.

- Most of the activity in the 3rd outbreak was focused in Guangdong, Fujian, and Zhejiang provinces (the red ones [on the maps at the URL above]).

- Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous region (in the far west) and Guizhou and Hubei provinces joined the list of host regions in outbreak 3.

- Xinjiang joined Guangxi and Jilin provinces (reporting cases in Outbreak 2) as regions of China that share a border with another country, heralding the movement of this H7N9 variant beyond China's borders, possibly into Viet Nam, North Korea, or a -stan.

Keep an eye out for H7N9 outbreak 4 coming to a colder China around November 2015.

[The maps and figures that can be accessed at the URL above are very informative and well worth taking the time to examine as a review of the 3 waves of avian influenza H7N9 in Mainland China, which was 1st detected in 2013. Also, see the discussion in ProMED-mail post "Avian influenza, human (98): China (JX) H7N9 20150502.3336779," listing the FluTrackers tally of cases of A(H7N9) in China, now at a total of 659 since the 1st case was reported 19 Feb 2013 in Shanghai, China.

The 3rd wave of H7N9 cases now appears to be dying out, but cases are likely to be detected again later this year (2015), when the transmission season recommences. As has been seen in the past, the virus is generally transmitted from infected poultry to humans, with only rare possible transmission between humans. One study estimated human to human transmissibility to have an R0 (reproductive number) of 0.06 to 0.35 (Kucharski AJ, et. al.. Transmission potential of influenza A(H7N9) virus, China, 2013-2014. _Emerg Infect Dis_. May 2015. http://dx.doi.org/10.3201/eid2105.141137). While the R0 is low, this avian influenza virus needs to be monitored for any changes in transmissibility.
