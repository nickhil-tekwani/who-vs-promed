Christine Mandella, the Kabale District health officer, said they are on high alert to respond to any suspected cases of any hemorrhagic fever including Ebola.

There is a suspected case of Rift Valley fever in the Kabale district. The suspect is a male hawker who is based in Kabale town but hails from Mitooma district. He is currently admitted in the isolation ward at Kabale Regional Referral Hospital.

Sister Christine Akurut, the principal nursing officer at the hospital, said the hawker, whose name has been withheld, voluntarily walked into the hospital on Tuesday morning [14 Aug 2018].

In June 2018, the Health Ministry confirmed the outbreak of the Rift Valley fever in Kasese district. In July this year [2018], the same disease was confirmed in Mbarara, Isingiro, and Kiruhura districts. There were also 3 cases of the Rift Valley fever confirmed in Kiboga, Buikwe, and Mityana districts, respectively.

Rift Valley fever is a viral infection that primarily affects animals but also has the capacity to infect humans. It presents with fever, severe illness, and abortions in animals. According to World Health Organization, the fever is transmitted to humans through poor handling of tissue of infected animals during slaughter, veterinary procedures, or disposal of carcasses or fetuses. The majority of human infections result from contact with blood or organs of infected animals and persons.

[Uganda has had human Rift Valley fever (RVF) in the recent past. A 29 Jun 2018 Uganda Ministry of Health announcement via WHO stated, "On 29 Jun 2018, the Uganda Ministry of Health notified WHO of an outbreak of Rift Valley fever (RVF) in Isingiro and Kasese districts, all located in the western region of the country. On [28 Jun 2018], 2 unrelated simultaneous cases were confirmed, one in each district. In Uganda, 2 districts have simultaneously confirmed RVF cases, with a possible 3rd one." Given these cases, the Uganda Ministry of Health is prudent to be on high alert to respond to any suspected cases of any hemorrhagic fever. Fortunately, this recent suspected case has tested negative for RVF, but the risk of additional cases is real. - Mod.TY
