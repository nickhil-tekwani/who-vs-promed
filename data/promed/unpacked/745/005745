The Salvadoran Health Ministry declared a state of "yellow alert" in light
of an increase in cholera cases, which have affected nearly 100 people over
the last few weeks. El Salvador's vice minister of Health, Herberth
Betancourt, said that 155 cases had been reported up to Tuesday, and if
infections continue at this rate an epidemic could result.
The official said that the alert includes the implementation of a
contingency plan and the opening of emergency rooms at public hospitals and
clinics to treat the patients suffering from the disease, as well as
prevention programs designed in joint collaboration between public and
private health care institutions.
Betancourt said that 70 percent of the cases have been detected in the
province of San Salvador and the central province of La Libertad, where
most of the country's population lives. "We have contacts with COEN (El
Salvador Emergency Committee) and we are requesting help from the local
governments across the country" to hold back the spread of the disease,
Betancourt said.
He expressed his concern over the upcoming spring vacations, which will
make the spread of cholera easier, especially at crowded beach resorts and
wherever there is a lack of hygiene.
Cholera appeared for the first time in El Salvador in the early 1990's,
affecting thousands of people and killing several dozen.
