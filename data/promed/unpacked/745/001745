On 29 Dec 2009, Aujeszky's disease was officially confirmed in a
hunting dog in the district of Wittenberg. This is the 1st finding of
this notifiable disease in an animal in Saxony-Anhalt since 1997. The
dog had eaten offal from a hunted wild boar and fell ill with typical
symptoms. The animal was examined at the State Office for Consumer
Protection (LAV) in Stendal, with positive results for Aujeszky's disease [AD].

AD is a notifiable, viral, acute febrile disease mainly affecting
pigs (as main host). Other species (ruminants, dogs, cats and other
carnivores) are final hosts for this always fatal infection of the
central nervous system: they don't excrete the virus, hence do not
spread the disease further. The virus (a herpes virus) can survive,
dependent on the temperature, for some time in meat, urine, excrement
and soil. Therefore, raw pork should not be fed to dogs and cats.

Since 1996, Saxony-Anhalt has been recognized as an AD-free country.
AD-free status is not only of benefit to pig farmers but presents
also a competitive advantage for associated industries in
intra-community and 3rd country trade. Maintaining the status will be
evidenced by ongoing investigations of blood samples in domestic pigs
and the wild boar population.

In recent years, antibodies against the Aujeszky virus have been
repeatedly detected by serology in wild boar, mainly in the eastern
districts of Saxony-Anhalt. A similar situation prevails in the
adjacent regions of the federal states of Brandenburg and Saxony.

A transmission of AD from wild boar to domestic pigs cannot be
completely ruled out. Therefore, effective implementation of animal
hygiene rules for pig farms (in particular, if a pig farmer is a
hunter) is important and essential to maintain the status of an
AD-free region in Germany. Since dogs and cats are particularly
susceptible to the AD-virus, and hunting dogs are exposed to an
increased risk of infection, the feeding of raw (wild) pig meat
should be avoided, and suspect animals should be presented to the veterinarian.

Infected cats and dogs fall ill after an incubation period of 2-9
days, with "personality changes," difficulty in swallowing, paralysis
of muscles and "rabid" behaviour. The animals suffer from severe
itching. There is no vaccine against Aujeszky's disease [in cats and dogs].

[Aujeszky's disease (pseudorabies) is a highly contagious,
economically significant disease of pigs. This viral infection causes
central nervous system (CNS) signs and high mortality rates in young
animals, and respiratory illness in older pigs. Other species may be
infected when they come in contact with infected pigs, resulting in a
universally fatal CNS disease. Aujeszky's disease can result in trade
restrictions from regions where it is endemic. Eradication programs
are underway or have been successful in many countries. In the United
States, all states are now considered to be free of the virus in
domesticated swine, and a surveillance program is ongoing. The
presence of the virus in feral pigs remains a concern.

Aujeszky's disease results from infection by Aujeszky's disease virus
(ADV), also known as pseudorabies virus. This virus is a member of
the genus _Varicellovirus_, subfamily Alphaherpesvirinae and family
Herpesviridae. Only a single serotype is known; however, strain
differences have been recognized using genetic assays, monoclonal
antibody techniques and other methods. The ADV strains found in feral
pigs in the United States appear to be attenuated and usually result
in subclinical infections if they are transmitted to domesticated swine.

Pigs are the natural host for Aujeszky's disease virus and the only
animals to become latent carriers. However, the virus can infect
nearly all domesticated and wild mammals including cattle, sheep,
goats, cats and dogs. It does not infect humans or the tailless apes,
and infections in horses are rare.

A diagnosis of Aujeszky's disease is established by detecting the
agent (virus isolation, polymerase chain reaction [PCR]), as well as
by detecting a serological response in the live animal.

The disease is controlled by containment of infected herds and by the
use of vaccines and/or removal of latently infected animals.

Vaccines, either gene-deleted attenuated or inactivated virus
vaccines should prevent or at least limit the excretion of virus from
the infected pigs. More recently, these conventional vaccines have
been supplemented by rDNA-derived gene-deleted or naturally deleted
live Aujeszky's disease virus vaccines. The virus used in these new
vaccines, sometimes referred to as marker vaccines, lacks a specific
glycoprotein (gG, gE, or gC). The above background is based upon
information from Iowa State's Center for Food Safety and Public
Health, at
<http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/aujeszkys_disease.pdf>
and OIE's Terrestrial manual 2008 at
<http://oie.int/eng/normes/mmanual/2008/pdf/2.01.02_AUJESZKYS_DIS.pdf>.

Aujeszky's disease has been formally absent from Germany's domestic
pig population since April 2000; it was finally eradicated there by
the culling of pigs in infected holdings. Its detection in a dog
infected from a wild boar is indicative of the continued circulation
of the virus in feral pigs or wild boars, a situation known to
prevail elsewhere.

The symptoms of Aujeszky's disease have not been seen in humans.
Seroconversion does occur. - Mod.AS]
