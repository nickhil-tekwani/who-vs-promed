Agricultural authorities in northwest China have culled about 95 000 chickens after an outbreak of the H5N1 bird flu virus, state press reported Wed [18 Apr 2012], AFP reports.

The outbreak in Touying township of the Ningxia region was discovered on Friday last week [13 Apr 2012] after over 23 000 chickens began showing symptoms, Xinhua news agency said, citing the Ministry of Agriculture.

The ministry said the "epidemic is now under control," the report said, while work teams have been sent to the area to step up prevention measures.

China is considered one of the nations most at risk of bird flu epidemics because it has the world's largest poultry population, and many chickens in rural areas are kept close to humans.

In January 2012, a man in southwest China's Guizhou province died after contracting the bird flu virus, the 2nd such fatality reported in China this year [2012], health authorities said.
