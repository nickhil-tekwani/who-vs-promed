New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks:
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1: Hamnevagen 38, Sydkoster, Stromstad, Vastra Gotaland Lan [County]
Date of start of the outbreak: 12 Sep 2014
Outbreak status: resolved (14 Nov 2014)
Epidemiological unit: farm
Water type: salt water
Population type: farmed
Production system: closed
Affected animals:
Species / Morbidity / Mortality / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Pacific Oyster (_Crassostrea gigas_) / 5 (scale 0 to 5) / 5 (scale 0 to 5) / 15 000 000 / 15 000 000 / 0 / 0
Affected population: the affected population consisted of oyster larvae and oysters.

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Pacific Oyster (_Crassostrea gigas_) / 100 / 100 / 100 / 100
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: Note by the OIE World Animal Health Information and Analysis Department: Since this is the 1st time that the infection with ostreid herpesvirus-1 microvariant is identified in the history of the country, the reason for notification as first occurrence applies to the country but the event is in fact limited to a zone.

Control measures
Measures applied: stamping-out; disinfection of infected premises/establishment(s); no vaccination; no treatment of affected animals

Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results:
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
National Veterinary Institute (National laboratory) / Pacific Oyster (_Crassostrea gigas_) / real-time (PCR) / 10 Nov 2014 / Positive
National Veterinary Institute (National laboratory) / Pacific Oyster (_Crassostrea gigas_) / virus sequencing / 12 Nov 2014 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[Infection with ostreid herpesvirus 1 (OsHV-1) microvariants is considered a viral infection of bivalve molluscs.

Mortality associated with OsHV-1 microvariants has been reported in the Pacific oyster, _Crassostrea gigas_, and in the Portuguese cupped oyster, _C. angulate_.

The Pacific oyster and the Portuguese cupped oyster are naturally infected by microvariants. Young stages, including larvae, spat and juveniles, seem to be more susceptible to the infection. The virus is easier to detect in moribund animals than in apparently healthy animals.

Microvariants have been reported associated with Pacific oyster mass mortalities in Europe (France, Ireland, Italy, The Netherlands, Spain, UK), Australia, New Zealand, and Korea but is known to be detected elsewhere in the absence of oyster mortalities (such as in Japan).

For the above and additional background information, including diagnostic methods and references, please refer to the OIE Aquatic Manual 2014, chapter 2.4.9, "Infection with ostreid herpesvirus 1 microvariants at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/aahm/current/2.4.09_INF_OSTREID_HERPES.pdf (adopted by the World Assembly of Delegates of the OIE in May 2014).

"The disease is temperature dependent only occurring when water temperatures exceed 16 deg C [60.8 deg F]. The highest mortalities occur in juvenile oysters, however all life stages are thought to be susceptible to infection.

Adult mortality varies between 10-30 percent; however juvenile mortality is a lot higher, between 60-100 percent.

The cause of the virus is still unknown, although it has been suggested that there are a number of causative agents. One of these is varying climates and temperatures. A French scientist, Tristan Renault, from the genetics and pathology lab at the IFREMER (French Research Institute for Exploitation of the Sea), has suggested in recent publications that one of the contributing factors to the appearance of the disease could be global warming and a subsequent significant rise in the ocean's temperature."
