The veterinary department [of] Thatta [Sindh province] is waiting for medical report of camels probably affected with camelpox as around 50 animals with a single hump ["dromedary"] have so far died in less than a week. Such a disease never hit this part of Sindh before, said veterinary experts.

Camelpox is a disease of camels caused by a virus of the family Poxviridae, subfamily Chordopoxvirinae and the genus Orthopoxvirus.

It is said the ailment causes skin lesions and is a generalised infection in [camels]. Around 25 percent of young camels [that] become infected die from the disease. In older camels it is generally milder. Although rare, the infection may spread to the hands of those that work closely with camels.

Animals with this ailment experience internal lesions of the mouth as well as of the respiratory and digestive tracts. Animals also experience loss of appetite and diarrhea.

A large proportion of camels acutely infected with camelpox die, although death is often attributed to a secondary infection.

The disease starts from the feet, an expert said. After swelling camel loses its strength to walk. Afterwards pimple appears on face and body of the animal.

The current cases are being seen as suspected camelpox, said animal husbandry deputy director Dr Salahuddin. Although the disease is endemic in other countries, we are facing the situation for the 1st time, added Salah.

The outbreak has been reported from Keti Bunder, Kharo Chhann, Ghorabari, Mohammad Khan Jatt, Moosa Jatt, Johu, union council Mehar and other [adjacent] coastal areas of the district. Mortality rate till today is 3 [animals? percent?], the numbers relating to those dead bodies we witnessed during our visit in the last 2 days. Seriously [affected] camels were provided medical treatment. Since results of medical [laboratory?] tests are expected in the next few days, supportive treatment like antibiotics and others is being provided to the animals at the moment.

Dr Salahuddin said so far around 120 outbreak-affected camels have been provided treatment in various costal areas of Thatta. Two medical teams of experts including doctors from Karachi and Tandojam visited Mehar goth Jam Jageer.

According to experts, 'Kharai', a single-humped camel breed, lives longer in deserts and can swim, unlike other camels. [See video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rLXY2nxJW4. - Mod.AS] The demand of breed usually remains high in United Arab Emirates and other Gulf countries during the days of Eid-ul-Azha.

In Thatta, there is no [updated] survey regarding the population of camels. It is estimated there would be around 10 000-12 000 'Kharai' camels.

Local fear of 'Samaro' outbreak may have erupted, a disease found in cattle. Let the medical reports come. But it is highly feared camels may have caught 'Samaro', said Shafi Murghur, a local social worker. ["Samaro" is one of 3 vernacular names of foot-and-mouth disease in Pakistan. The others are Mookhar and Moharo. See reference at http://www.fspublishers.org/published_papers/89903_..pdf. - Mod.AS]

"The disease affects feet and mouth. Around 90 percent of animals cannot survive if they catch the disease," he added.

Although there are no official figures available, it seems total casualties may have crossed the current number. Only 8 animals were reported dead yesterday [15 Nov 2014] at Mir Jatt village near Garho. In areas of Ghorabari and nearby areas some 7 cases were reported, opined Murghur.

[An OIE list of infectious diseases of interest for camelids, published in 2010, includes the following viral diseases in dromedary camels:
Group I: known to produce significant diseases in dromedaries: camelpox, contagious ecthyma, papillomatosis, rabies, Rift Valley fever (RVF).
Group II: diseases for which dromedaries are potential pathogen carriers: African horse sickness (AHS), bluetongue (BT), bovine viral diarrhea (BVD), peste des petits ruminants (PPR); [MERS-CoV may now be considered for inclusion].
Group III: minor diseases: Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF), herpesvirus infections, West Nile fever.

For further details (such as diagnosis) as well as for the lists of bacterial, parasitic, and fungal diseases in dromedary camels, please refer to http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Our_scientific_expertise/docs/pdf/A_Diseases_Camelids_May10.pdf.

Camelpox is the only camel disease included in OIE's list of reportable diseases. A chapter on camelpox has been recently added to OIE's manual of terrestrial animal diseases, following its endorsement by OIE's assembly during the General Session of May 2014. Its introduction follows:

"Camelpox is a wide-spread infectious viral disease of Old World camelids. New World camelids are also susceptible. It occurs throughout the camel-breeding areas of Africa, north of the equator, the Middle East and Asia, and has an important economic impact through loss of production and sometimes death. Camelpox does not occur in the feral camel population of Australia. The camelpox virus belongs to the family Poxviridae, subfamily Chordopoxvirinae, genus Orthopoxvirus.

The disease is characterised by fever, local or generalised pox lesions on the skin and in the mucous membranes of the mouth and respiratory tract. The clinical manifestations range from inapparent infection to mild, moderate and, less commonly, severe systemic infection and death. The disease occurs more frequently and more severely in young animals and pregnant females. Transmission is by either direct contact between infected and susceptible animals or indirect infection via a contaminated environment. The role of insects in transmission has been suspected because the disease is often observed after rainfall. Camelpox virus is very host specific and does not infect other animals. Zoonotic camelpox virus infection in humans associated with outbreaks in dromedary camels (_Camelus dromedarius_) was described in the north-eastern region of India during 2009. This was a single incident illustrating that camelpox is of limited public health importance".

Subscribers will note that foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is regarded by the OIE as not affecting dromedary camels. This is apparent from the following sentence in the FMD chapter 8.7 (article 8.7.1), which says: "According to the Code, for the purposes of this chapter, ruminants include animals of the family of Camelidae (except _Camelus dromedarius_)".

Pakistan is one of the leading camel-breeding countries (about one million animals). Results of epidemiological and laboratory investigations in Sindh are requested. - Mod.AS
