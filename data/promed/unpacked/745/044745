Encephalitis has claimed yet another life when a person died at GMCH [Gauhati Medical College and Hospital] on Tuesday [14 Jul 2015].

He was a man from Sonitpur district who has been battling for his life for the last 3 days. He died in the early morning hours after a woman also died of this disease in Golaghat district on Monday [13 Jul 2015].

With this, the toll has gone up to 21 during the last couple of days, and 14 other people are still undergoing treatment at GMCH.

[This is the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) transmission season in northeastern India, including Assam state. Initially, An earlier report this year (2015) indicated that JE cases in Assam have increased over the past 5 years. Previously, it was only an upper Assam disease, but now it has also been detected in lower Assam districts and in all the 27 districts in Assam. However, the above report does not indicate whether these cases are laboratory confirmed as JEV infections or are due to some other etiologic agent. ProMED would appreciate receiving results of any laboratory tests that have been done.

As mentioned in previous comments, the encephalitis picture in this region of India is complicated. The JE virus etiology of some previously reported encephalitis cases has been confirmed by laboratory tests. However, many cases go undiagnosed, or JE virus infection is ruled out, and other etiologies, including Reye syndrome-like disease and lychee consumption, have been proposed. No mention is made of the JE virus vaccination status of the cases above or of the population in the affected area. Vaccination is more likely to be effective for prevention of JE cases than vector control, particularly in the areas of paddy rice cultivation that provide abundant _Culex_ vector mosquito breeding sites. The virus doubtless is endemic in northeastern India. Ardeid birds (heron family) are reservoir hosts.
