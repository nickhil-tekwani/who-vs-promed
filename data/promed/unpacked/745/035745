(Received December 28, 1998. Accepted January 22, 1999)
SUMMARY : Enterovirus 71 (EV71), one of the major causative agents for hand,
foot and mouth disease (HFMD), is sometimes associated with severe central
nervous system diseases. In 1997, in Malaysia and Japan, and in 1998 in
Taiwan, there were HFMD epidemics involving sudden deaths among young
children, and EV71 was isolated from the HFMD patients, including the fatal
cases. The nucleotide sequences of each EV71 isolate were determined and
compared by phylogenetical analysis. EV71 strains from previously reported
epidemics belonged to genotype A-1, while those from recent epidemics could
be divided into two genotypes, A-2 and B. In Malaysia, genotype A-2 was more
prevalent, while in Japan and Taiwan, B genotype was more prevalent. Two
isolates from fatal cases in Malaysia and one isolate from a fatal case in
Japan were genotype A-2. However, all isolates from three fatal cases in
Taiwan belonged to genotype B. The severity of the HFMD did not link
directly to certain genotypes of EV71.
