Woman dies from tick-transmitted disease in Yozgat
--------------------------------------------------
A woman from the central Anatolian province of Yozgat died Wednesday [21
May 2008] at an Ankara hospital where she was being treated for
Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, a viral disease contracted from a tick
bite which can be fatal.

Cekerek District Governor Ahmet Odabaui talked to the Anatolia news agency
about the incident, saying that the 28 year old woman, who was living in
the Bayindirhoyuk village of Cekerek, was sent to Yozgat State Hospital
last week after she was bitten by a tick. She was later transferred to
Ankara Numune Hospital when her condition deteriorated and died yesterday
at this hospital.

The woman's death is the 6th fatal case of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever
in the country this year [2008]. The number of tick bite cases increase as
the weather gets warmer and people engage in more activities outdoors. In
the past 5 years 94 people have died in Turkey from Crimean-Congo
hemorrhagic fever. People who have come into contact with a tick should be
monitored for 10 days following contact and seek professional medical care
if symptoms of fever, headache, nausea, vomiting or diarrhea present
themselves.

Istanbul's ticks do not transmit CCHF, says expert
--------------------------------------------------
Infectious diseases expert Dr Hurrem Bodur has said people with tick bites
should go to the hospital, but that there was no need for Istanbulites to
panic. An expert in infectious diseases has said there is no reason to
panic over ticks in Istanbul since they do not carry Crimean-Congo
hemorrhagic fever (CCHF), which has recently sparked fears throughout the
country.

"There is no need to panic. Scientific studies have proven that the ticks
in Istanbul do not carry Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever. You should go to
a hospital if ticks bite you, but there is no need to worry," said Dr
Bodur, the head of the Infectious Diseases Clinic at Ankara's Numune Hospital.

Istanbulites have recently begun to fear for their pastime of picnicking
because of a number of reported CCHF cases in Turkey. CCHF is transmitted
by tick bites and can be fatal. More than 1200 people went to emergency
rooms in hospitals throughout Istanbul over the weekend [24-25 May 2008]
because of tick bites. However, none of these people were infected with
CCHF. There were 4 CCHF incidents in Istanbul last year [2007], but these
people were infected by the CCHF virus during visits to other cities.

Bodur said the ticks that carry the CCHF virus are primarily found in the
provinces of Sivas, Tokat, Gumushane, Bayburt, Amasya, Cankin, Corum,
Yozgat, Samsun, Karabuk and Kastamonu. She added that people bitten by
ticks should go directly to a hospital no matter which city they are living
in. Bodur also added there was no need for panic as long as one does not
take the tick out of his/her body themselves and added that the rumors that
ticks carrying CCHF had come to big cities like Istanbul and Ankara were
not true.

Bodur said [since] ticks cannot fly they cannot spread to other cities as
long as animals or human beings do not carry them. "People buying animals
from cities in which there have been CCHF incidents should check these
animals for ticks. In this way we can prevent the circulation of ticks
carrying the CCHF virus," she explained. Answering a question about whether
these ticks could spread to all of Turkey, Bodur said: "Theoretically this
is possible. But practically the living spaces of [CCHF-carrying] ticks are
restricted to rice planting basins and around these places. The species
transmitting CCHF cannot live out of these places. We have not seen any new
CCHF incidents in cities other than those we saw them in last year."

Universities in Turkey are trying to develop a vaccine against CCHF. In
Central Europe, people are vaccinated against another illness [tickborne
encephalitis - Mod.CP] that ticks are transmitting again. Aykut Darendeli,
an instructor at the veterinary school at Elazig's Firat University, said
they have been conducting studies to develop a vaccine against CCHF for
four years with support from the Scientific and Technological Research
Council of Turkey (TUBITAK), adding: "We are developing this vaccine
project to immunize people against CCHF. We have not conducted our
experiments on animals yet, so I cannot claim we will definitely succeed."

TAEK tries tick sterilization to prevent further tickborne disease
------------------------------------------------------------------
The Turkish Atomic Energy Agency (TAEK) has taken a step to prevent a rise
in the tick population through a male sterilization and release program, a
method scientists expect will help prevent further cases of
tick-transmitted disease. TAEK officials announced that they have started
sterilizing ticks collected from regions where people have died from
Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) -- a tickborne viral disease that
often proves fatal -- in order to control the number of ticks that spread
CCHF and other infectious diseases. The technique utilizes a form of
irradiation to destroy or seriously debilitate the testes of the male insects.

"We have collected many ticks from regions where there have been incidents
of CCHF-related deaths. We have sterilized them and then released them back
to the wild. These sterilized ticks will continue to copulate, but will not
be able to reproduce or will produce nonviable larvae. With this method, we
expect to see a significant decrease in the number of ticks carrying CCHF,"
said a TAEK official.

The same official noted that using insecticides against ticks is not an
effective way of curbing their population in the long term. "These insects
often develop resistance to such insecticides over time," he added.

Meanwhile, a man from northern Samsun province died on Tuesday [4 Jun 2008]
at a hospital where he was being treated for CCHF. The man, who was living
in the Armutlu village of Asarcik district, was sent to Ondokuz Mayis
University Hospital last week after he was bitten by a tick while working
in his garden. His death is the 17th fatal case of CCHF in four Turkish
provinces, namely Samsun, Corum, Tokat and Amasya, this year [2008]. The
number of tick bite cases increase as the weather gets warmer and people
engage in more activities outdoors. In the past 5 years, 94 people have
died in Turkey from CCHF. People who have come into contact with a tick
should be monitored for 10 days following contact and seek professional
medical care if symptoms of fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea
present themselves.
