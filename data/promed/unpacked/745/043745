Genotype of Rabies from Bats in Latin America
---------------------------------------------
[Dr Oscar Larghi has sent the following information in relation to the
discussion of the genotyping of rabies isolates from bats in Europe and
Asia. - Mod.CP]
Rabies virus (genotype 1) has also been found abundantly in hematophagous
[vampire] and non-hematophagous [generally insectivorous] bats in Latin
America.
