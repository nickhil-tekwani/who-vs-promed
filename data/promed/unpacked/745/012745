The Humboldt County Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) [California] is reminding the pubic about the importance of being tested because gonorrhea is on the rise in the county.

Health officials explained that gonorrhea can be successfully treated if caught early and is one of the most common sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) in the U.S. More than 800 000 infections are estimated to occur each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

"In Humboldt County, we have seen an increase in cases of both chlamydia and gonorrhea over the last 3 years, especially in the last 3 months," said DHHS Public Health Nurse Eric Gordon.

From 1 Jan through 15 Apr 2015, there have been 82 cases of gonorrhea reported to Public Health, according to DHHS's Epidemiologist Ron Largusa. This trend represents a doubling of cases and rate from 2014 and a 10-fold increase in cases and rate from 2010.

Since 2010, the rate of gonorrhea has increased throughout California, recently reaching its highest point in a 20-year period. Regionally, a number of northern California counties have experienced an increase in the number of gonorrhea cases over the last several years, Gordon said.

The infection is sexually transmitted and can also be spread from an infected pregnant mother to her child during delivery. To reduce the risk of contracting any STD, Gordon recommends that people get tested regularly, know their partner's STD results before starting a new sexual relationship, always use condoms, and minimize anonymous sexual relations and sex with multiple partners.

While as many as 50 percent of gonorrhea cases show no symptoms, those that do most often present themselves in the following ways: For men: A burning sensation when urinating; A white, yellow, or green discharge from the penis; Painful or swollen testicles (although this is less common). For women: Painful or burning sensation when urinating; Increased vaginal discharge; and Vaginal bleeding between periods. Gonorrhea can cause serious and permanent health problems if left untreated, the CDC states. In women, it can cause pelvic inflammatory disease, which can cause complications, including: Formation of scar tissue that blocks fallopian tubes; Ectopic pregnancy (pregnancy outside the womb); Infertility; and Long-term pelvic/abdominal pain.

In men, gonorrhea can cause a painful condition in the tubes attached to the testicles. In rare cases, this may cause a man to be sterile. Although uncommon, untreated gonorrhea can also spread to blood or joints which can be life-threatening, according to the CDC.

One of the most important things that can be done to stop the spread of STDs is to ensure that all sexual partners who may have been exposed to the infection are notified. If someone is not comfortable notifying their partner(s), they can contact Public Health at 707-268-2174 to arrange for anonymous partner notification. For more information and to get tested or treated, call your health care provider. You can also call the Public Health Clinic at 707-268-2108 to schedule an afternoon appointment. Free condoms are available at Public Health's main office, 529 I Street, as well as the Community Wellness Center, 908 Seventh Street, both in Eureka.

[Gonorrhea rates in the U.S. in 2009 decreased to 98.1 cases per 100 000 population, the lowest rate since recording of gonorrhea rates began. Between 2009 and 2012, the gonorrhea rate increased each year to 106.7 cases per 100 000 population in 2012. In 2013, the gonorrhea rate decreased slightly to 106.1 cases per 100 000 population. However, in 2013, for the 1st time since 2000, the rate of reported gonorrhea cases among men was higher than the rate among women; during 2009-2013, the rate among men increased 20.3 percent, while the rate among women decreased 2.0 percent (http://www.cdc.gov/std/stats13/natoverview.htm). The increase among men compared with a decrease among women suggests either increased transmission or increased case ascertainment (e.g., through changes in screening practices such as increased testing and increased extra-genital screening) among MSM (http://www.cdc.gov/std/stats13/natoverview.htm).

Because many jurisdictions do not routinely report sex of sex partners or site of infection for gonorrhea cases, trends in gonorrhea rates among men who have sex with men (MSM) cannot be assessed (http://www.cdc.gov/std/stats13/gonorrhea.htm). However, The STD Surveillance Network, a network of 12 states and independently funded cities collecting enhanced information on a representative sample of gonorrhea cases reported to the state or city health department from all reporting sources, provides more complete estimates of case characteristics often missing on routine case reports, such as gender of sex partners. From the STD Surveillance Network data, the CDC estimates that in 2012, 26.6 percent of gonorrhea cases were among MSM, 29.4 percent among men who have sex with women (MSW), and 44.1 percent among women. San Francisco County had the highest proportion of estimated MSM cases (87.8 percent), while the lowest proportion of morbidity estimated to be attributed to MSM was found in Jefferson County (Birmingham), Alabama at 10.9 percent (http://www.cdc.gov/std/stats12/gonorrhea.htm).

The above news report fails to characterize cases of gonococcal disease in Humboldt County, California as to sex, sex of sex partners or site of infection for gonorrhea cases, which is essential for better targeting of gonorrhea control efforts (http://www.cdc.gov/std/stats13/gonorrhea.htm).

_Neisseria gonorrhoeae_ has progressively developed resistance to each of the antibiotics used for treatment of gonorrhea. Dual therapy with ceftriaxone plus either azithromycin or doxycycline is now the only CDC recommended treatment regimen for gonorrhea. The percentage of isolates that exhibit elevated ceftriaxone minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) increased from 0.1 percent in 2008 to 0.4 percent in 2011, and decreased slightly to 0.3 percent in 2012. The proportion of isolates with elevated azithromycin MICs decreased from 0.5 percent in 2010 to 0.3 percent in 2012.

Humboldt County, with a population of 134 623 in 2010, is located in Northern California on the Pacific Coast, 200 miles north of San Francisco. The county seat is Eureka. - Mod.ML
