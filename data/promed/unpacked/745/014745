State health officials said a North Carolina hunter has tested positive for rabbit fever. The Wilson Times reported a 2nd rabbit hunter in eastern North Carolina is showing signs of the disease officially called tularemia.

Although rare, rabbit fever is a serious and potentially fatal disease. Symptoms can include fever, chills, headache, muscle aches, joint pain, dry cough, and progressive weakness. The disease is treated with antibiotics. Officials said both hunters appear to be recovering. Their names have not been released.

Officials said the disease is caused by the bacterium _Francisella tularensis_. It's typically found in animals, especially rodents and rabbits. Most cases occur in rural areas.

The disease can be transmitted by eating infected food and can even be transmitted through the air. Authorities said there have been 17 cases of the illness in North Carolina since 1999. There are about 200 cases reported annually in the USA. Rabbit hunting season runs until 28 Feb 2013.

[Tularemia is typically found in animals, especially small mammals such as voles, mice, rodents, rabbits, and hares. _Francisella tularensis_ is found in a wide range of animal hosts and is capable of surviving for weeks at low temperatures in water, moist soil, or decaying plant and animal matter.

Although hundreds of differing vertebrates and invertebrates can be infected with the tularemia bacillus, no more than a dozen or so are important in its ecology. Humans become infected through a variety of mechanisms including bites of infected arthropods (mosquitoes, ticks, deerflies), handling infected or dead animals, ingesting contaminated food or water, and inhaling aerosols of bacteria.

The type of exposure will dictate the form of the disease manifestation with cutaneous exposures usually resulting in the glandular or ulceroglandular forms. The type of disease in these cases is not stated. - Mod.LL
