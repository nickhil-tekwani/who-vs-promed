A community creche in County Monaghan has been closed over an outbreak of an _E. coli_ infection among children and staff. Ballybay Community Creche was forced to close following the outbreak, to limit the spread of the infection. All children and staff members are due to be screened to see if they have picked up the infection.

The outbreak is believed to be of the Verotoxigenic Escherichia coli (generally now referred to as Shiga toxin-producing _E. coli_ [STEC] or enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ [EHEC]) strain of the bacterium, which causes mild illness in most cases. However in some serious cases EHEC can produce a toxin that damages the wall of the bowel, which can lead to severe diarrhea. In 5-8 per cent of cases the infection can cause hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS), which is potentially life threatening. HUS, which is more common among children under 5 years of age and the elderly, can result in anemia and subsequent kidney failure.

A spokeswoman for the Health Service Executive said the Monaghan creche was closed after "a number of linked cases of EHEC infection" were detected. "Parents and caregivers of children attending the creche have been advised to monitor their children to see if they develop the symptoms of diarrhea, particularly bloody diarrhea," the spokeswoman said. EHEC is commonly transmitted by personal contact, and is particularly common in childcare facilities.

So far in 2018, there have been 36 recorded cases of EHEC infections in the northeast region. In a minority of cases the patients were hospitalized, but there were no fatalities. In 2017 there were 73 recorded cases.

The HSE has previously warned the frequency of EHEC infections has been increasing in recent years, and advised the public to avoid infection by taking precautions such as keeping up good hand-washing practices.

[Enteric infections including EHEC can spread easily in the childcare setting. Infections with _E. coli_ that produce Shiga toxin, the prototypic strain being O157:H7, can result in bloody, usually non-febrile, diarrhea which may progress to kidney failure and breakdown of red blood cells related to the toxin's effect on the kidney. The use of antibiotics in the early stages of the infection can increase the risk of complications.
