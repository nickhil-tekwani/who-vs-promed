Coffee wilt disease reduces trees by half
-----------------------------------------
Coffee wilt has reduced the country's robusta coffee plantations by 50 per
cent, according to the Uganda Coffee Development Authority [UCDA]. The
managing director, Henry Ngabirano, disclosed that the disease had claimed
150 of the 300 million robusta trees, which were planted 40 years ago. He
said the Government had replaced an estimated 85 million robusta trees
since 2002.

Ngabirano, however, said despite the disease, the country's revenue from
coffee exports had increased from USD 84m in 2002 to USD 388m in 2008.
Uganda coffee products have been marketed in the US, China, and Egypt.

The challenges to the coffee sector include inadequate funding of the
authority. This has affected research, production, and the availability of
seedlings resistant to coffee wilt. Former finance minister Gerald
Ssendaula criticised the body over failure to launch the 8 coffee
wilt-resistant varieties it had developed.

[It was] noted that original coffee growing areas like Buganda and Busoga
had abandoned coffee farming, while western and northern regions were
emerging as new coffee zones. [The UCDA board] promised to increase the
availability of seedlings and promote the growing of coffee in the new zones.

[Coffee wilt disease (CWD, also called tracheomycosis) is caused by the
fungus _Gibberella xylarioides_. Of the 2 coffee species grown
commercially, _Coffea arabica_(arabica or highland coffee) and _Coffea
canephora_ (robusta or lowland coffee), it affects only the latter. CWD can
attack all stages of growth and infected plants show 100 per cent
mortality. Symptoms include wilting, defoliation, and streaks in the wood
and occur sequentially until all branches are killed. Berries ripen
prematurely and dry up. Spread occurs with infected plant material
(firewood, seedlings), contaminated soil or tools, by wind, water, and
mechanical means. While cultural practices have shown some success in
disease management, crop varieties with higher levels of CWD resistance
appear to be the most promising approach.

Previously, the disease only occurred sporadically in Africa, but it has
become more virulent and is now considered a major constraint to African
coffee production. In Uganda, 90 per cent of the coffee crop is robusta.
CWD emerged in 1996, and by 2002 the disease had affected at least 90 per
cent of robusta farms and destroyed over 45 per cent of the crop. In a
subsequent mass replanting exercise, farmers mainly used highly CWD
susceptible cultivars. The reasons for this are unclear, but due to this
fact the 85 million replacement trees mentioned above may in the meantime
also have succumbed to CWD. It appears that CWD resistant varieties have
been developed but that a problem remains of distributing them to farmers.
