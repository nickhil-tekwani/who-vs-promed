Comment on incubation period and onset of contagiousness
--------------------------------------------------------
References and official communications about smallpox list the traditional
7-17 day (average 10-12 day) incubation period. Should there be a smallpox
outbreak anywhere in the world, it would [probably be based upon the
release of a smallpox stock derived from the Russian bioweapons programme.
According to Ken Alibek MD PhD, who oversaw the development of that and
other bioweapons, the incubation period for the Russian smallpox weapon
was 3 to 5 days. I would think that this is the incubation period that
should be used, since there is really no other likely place from where it
could come.
The belief that smallpox becomes contagious only after the rash appears may
also be incorrect. Russian studies in the 1930s or 40s suggest that it may
become contagious on the last day before the skin lesions appear. In
addition, patients may develop lesions on the oral mucosa a day before the
skin lesions erupt, and these may be unnoticed but coincide with the onset
of contagiousness.
I would be interested in anyone else's thoughts about this.
