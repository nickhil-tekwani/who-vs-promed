[For a map of the Former Republic of Macedonia, go to http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/bosnia/fyrm.jpg. It is on the northern border with Kosovo. For Saraj, south west of Skopje, go to http://www.fallingrain.com/world/MK/90/Saraj.html. For Raovikj, go to http://www.fallingrain.com/world/MK/F6/Raovic.html; it is to the west of Saraj, in the hill country.

This is a bit of a puzzler. This is the 1st livestock case since 2008, when there were some animals suspected because of 2 human cases, in spite of the absence of reported animals, since there have been human cases in 2011 (3), 2012 (2), and 1 in 2014. So there is a background of sporadic livestock cases which are unreported. Nearby Kosovo is not a current member of OIE but reported sporadic cases in 2004. If I were to speculate on the presumption that livestock anthrax is truly sporadic in Macedonia, I would suspect that this outbreak might be a result of contaminated imported commercial dairy feed, unless this farm has seen cases in the previous 5 to 8 years. It is November, and in that hilly country, the cows will have been brought in for the winter. - Mod.MHJ
