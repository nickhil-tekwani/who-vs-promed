Health experts don't rule out anthrax outbreak in state
-------------------------------------------------------
Health officials of the [Jharkhand] state chapter of Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP) has not ruled out an outbreak of anthrax in the state, despite medical reports of 2 persons from Simdega, who died on [8 May 2015], showing negative results.

IDSP's state director Dr Ramesh Prasad told TOI on Tuesday [19 Mary 2015] that anthrax bacilli (_Bacillus anthracis_) are found naturally in soil and can remain dormant for more than 50 years. "They (the bacilli) surface during monsoon and infect grazing cattle, which can be easily transmitted to human beings," said Prasad.

The health programme officials say tribals are more susceptible because of their food habit. "In tribal societies, people consume the meat of cattle that are infected. It can be very dangerous," Prasad told TOI. Incidentally, both anthrax outbreaks in Simdega (the 1st one being in Bano block of the district in November last year [2014]) occurred after locals consumed dead cattle meat.

Medical experts are stressing on the need to identify anthrax-prone zones across Jharkhand as there are incubator zones, a technical term for places where the bacilli lie dormant after an earlier occurrence. "Unfortunately, there are no records of early anthrax occurrences in Jharkhand (and erstwhile Bihar) prior to the November [2014] outbreak," Dr Sumant Mishra, director of state health services said.

The disease ... can be traced by inspecting livestock that die under mysterious circumstances. But an iron curtain between the health and the animal husbandry departments ensures no such monitoring happens. Last month [April 2015], a large number of livestock died because of the disease in Giridih [Jharkhand state], "but we have no clue how they happen," a senior health official said.

The outbreaks in Simdega could mean that it has become an incubator zone for anthrax bacilli and this could be alarming for residents of Ranchi [Jharkhand state], which is located around 100 km [about 60 miles] away. However, there is not much to be done at this moment, say experts. "For now, we can only create awareness among people, especially tribals, to refrain from dead cattle meat. Awareness camps are being organized in the affected areas," Dr Prasad said, adding, "awareness is the only way to contain an outbreak."

Several states like Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Kerala have been affected by anthrax repeatedly. An independent research revealed that 618 cases of anthrax outbreak have been reported in Tamil Nadu between 1995 and 2006.

[It has been very clear to onlookers that there is minimal coordination between the public health and veterinary services in many Indian states. And, frankly, the most cost effective way of dealing with human outbreaks is by preventing the livestock outbreaks from which human exposure follows. And the rural communities would benefit by not losing expensive livestock. The majority of the livestock outbreaks occur in poor rural areas where the villagers depend on these animals both for food and for ploughing and other agricultural activities. To be effective, livestock vaccination for anthrax should be proactive, not reactive. And accurate ecological niche modeling can be done at high accuracy and resolution to define areas at risk of anthrax and where vaccination should have a priority. - Mod.MHJ
