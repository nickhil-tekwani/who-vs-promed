Apart from the usual health problems associated with fresh food there is a
major potential problem associated with sushi that includes fresh fish, and
this is anisakid worms. This is a comparatively recent problem. When fish
were gutted at sea immediately after being caught the anisakid worms were
removed when the fish were gutted. Over the last 30 odd years the move has
been towards chilling the fish and gutting them on-shore. When this occurs
the anisakid worms have time to migrate from the dying gut into the flesh.
When these live worms are consumed they can cause disease in humans. I have
spoken to the owner of the major Japanese restaurant in Queenstown about
this and given him some documentation.
Despite this I still enjoy sushi/sashimi.

As a sushi fan and a friend and neighbor of a sushi bar owner:
Here in Cleveland, there are two sources for sushi-quality fish. (1) A
seafood supply wholesaler who has a trained sushi fish inspector and
also buys sealed packages from a distributor who inspects each fish,
and (2) a nationwide chain of in-grocery sushi stands. Re: (2) Their fish
arrives via air freight each morning from a central facility in
California (Being located just below my office, I see the delivery
each morning).
>From Steven Jay Gould's book about "Jewish Grandmothers", one can gain
an appreciation of the risks of uninspected undercooked fish.
The national sushi shop chain is "AFC" and they have a Web site.

A useful publication is available entitled "Fish parasites and human
health" by JA Sakanari, M. Moser and TL Deardorff, Report No.
T-CSGCP-034 Sea Grant College, UC, La Jolla, CA. Copies can be
obtained for $4 from Calif. Sea Grant College, UC, 9500 Gilman Dr., ,
Dept. 0232, La Jolla, CA 92093-0232. It covers life cycles, factors
affecting transmission., prevention, politics and public education.
As far as the dangers of sushi are concerned it is my understanding that
the problems are minimal when the sushi is served at a restaurant by a
qualified sushi chef. The great majority of cases of parasitism derived
from sushi, both in Japan where it is relatively common, and in the
U.S., where it is rare, are derived from home prepared sushi. Sushi
chefs in Japan undergo an extended and rigorous training program which
includes instruction on how to search for and avoid parasitized seafood.

From: Richard Frankel <rfrankel@hawaii.edu>

Because of concerns about sushi, which were not directed particularly at
sushi bars (where sushi is prepared to order) but more at vendors who sell
sushi made earlier in the day, Hawaii enacted the following regulations. I
believe these went into effect early in 1997, but am not certain of the
date.
For all potentially hazardous foods, the requirement is that they be
maintained at or below forty-five degrees Fahrenheit or at or above one
hundred forty degrees Fahrenheit during display and service. (Sorry to use
Fahrenheit, but this is the U.S.!)
The following exception was created to enable vendors to continue to sell
sushi.
Potentially hazardous food may be kept at a temperature between forty-five
degrees Fahrenheit and one hundred forty degrees Fahrenheit if the following
requirements are met:
1) The total time that the food is within this temperature range does not
exceed four hours.
2) Foods are labelled as to the time the food is removed from safe
temperature control, or labelled as to the time by which the food must be
served or discarded.
3) Foods not properly labelled as to time, or beyond the four hour limit,
must be discarded.
