6 cases of botulism have been reported in Buryatia between 1
and 12 Oct 2005. According to the territorial management of
the Russian consumer protection agency [Rospotrebnadzor] all
victims ate salt omul, prepared in the home.
Since the beginning of 2005, 17 inhabitants of Buryatia have
developed botulism. No deaths have occurred. In 2004, 35
people developed botulism from contaminated fish and 2 died.

[Buryatia is located in the southern part of Eastern
Siberia, to the south and to the east of Lake Baikal. In the
south, Buryatia borders the Mongolian National Republic.
Fish dishes from omul (fried, salted, or smoked) are
traditional Baikal delicacies. -ProMED-mail Russian

The method of diagnosis of botulism is not stated here.
Individual cases of the paralysis can be confused with other
diseases, but a cluster of such cases is certainly likely to
be botulism. Type E botulism is the type frequently
associated with fish products (1).
Classically, botulism is a foodborne disease caused by the
ingestion of preformed toxin, although there also exists
wound botulism (in which _C. botulinum_ spores germinate in
a wound), and infant botulism (in which the spores germinate
in the intestinal tract).
Types A, B, and E of human botulism are the commonest.
Although each type has a similar symptom complex, Hughes and
colleagues report that type E is much more likely to produce
initial lethargic mental status and more autonomic
dysfunction (2).
