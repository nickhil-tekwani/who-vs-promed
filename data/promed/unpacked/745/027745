Wildlife biologists with the Virginia Department of Game and Inland
Fisheries are investigating reports of deer found dead or dying in several
counties across the Commonwealth.
A viral disease known as Epizootic hemorrhagic disease (EHD) is suspected
as the cause of the deer mortalities. EHD is a common infectious disease of
white-tailed deer, and outbreaks occur annually in the Southeast. Currently
many states across the Southeast are experiencing EHD outbreaks. The
Department of Game and Inland Fisheries is continuing to monitor this
situation and will continue to provide technical assistance to affected
landowners.
Those who have observed sick or dead deer in their area and suspect EHD may
be the cause, should report it to a wildlife biologist at one of the
following Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries regional
offices: Marion (540-782-9051); Forest (804-525- 7522); Fredericksburg
(540-899-4169); Williamsburg (757-253-4180) or Verona (540-248-9360).
