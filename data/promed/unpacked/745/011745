After the detection last week of a positive case of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) in a small farm in the commune of Bulnes [Nuble province, Bio Bio region], the Agricultural and Livestock Service (SAG by its initials in Spanish) initiated a comprehensive epidemiological investigation in order to avoid this outbreak from spreading or affecting other neighboring properties.

This is the 1st detection of the virus in Nuble province since 2007, when the disease was eradicated from the country.

"This case was detected during routine monitoring by SAG, which has allowed us to implement health measures to determine the source of infection and the rapid elimination of the outbreak, through the slaughter of pigs close to the focus, about 400 pigs," said Eduardo Fuhrer Jimenez, regional manager of Animal Protection for SAG.

He also highlighted the work in coordination with the private sector, through the Association of Pork Producers (Asprocer), and the joint effort in the implementation of the National Plan for Control and Eradication of PRRS, in order to recover the health status of "free country" and again have the OIE declare Chile as a country free of the disease, as it did in 2012. As explained, this strategy includes working together with the private sector, in order to prevent, contain, and again eradicate the disease in the country.

PRRS is an infectious disease caused by the virus of the same name, which can cause reproductive failure of swine females and respiratory problems in piglets and pigs at later stages of growth. In October 2013 the disease was detected in the Metropolitan Region and later in the
O'Higgins Region.

The disease is characterized by dry cough, cyanosis of the ears (blue color), and in reproductive females signs such as abortions, smaller fetuses, birth of smaller and weaker pigs.

This is a notifiable disease, so the SAG has called on producers to notify, in a timely manner, the appearance of any signs compatible with the disease so that the appropriate sanitary measures can be implemented.

PRRS is a disease that only affects swine, not humans. It is present in most countries where there is intensive pig production, causing serious economic losses in the swine industry, and its access to foreign markets.

[This disease emerged in North America and Europe, roughly simultaneously, in the late 1980s. It was first called by the wonderfully descriptive title of "mystery swine disease". It is also commonly found in Asia. Its spread to Africa really does complete the picture of a pandemic that has relentlessly but not very rapidly spread across a wide swath of the world.

The disease is characterized by late-term abortions, stillbirths, piglets born weak, and respiratory signs in pigs of all ages. Production losses from the disease are severe. It is a very damaging disease economically, as the fruit of much of the investment on a swine farm is lost through abortion and infertility.

PRRS is an acronym (porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome) for a viral disease characterized by 2 overlapping clinical presentations, reproductive impairment or failure in breeding animals, and respiratory disease in pigs of any age. PRRS is the most economically significant disease to affect US swine production since the eradication of classical swine fever (CSF).

Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) occurs in all age groups. Reproductive impairment or failure, more obvious in sows or gilts, also affects some boars. The respiratory syndrome is seen more often in young growing pigs but also occurs in naive finishing pigs and breeding stock.

Although reported initially in only a few countries in the late 1980s, PRRS now occurs worldwide in most major swine-raising countries. PRRS is prevalent in the United States and exists both in epidemic and endemic forms.

The PRRS virus is an enveloped RNA virus in the genus _Arterivirus_, classified in the virus family, _Arteriviridae_. There is considerable heterogeneity in the genome of the PRRS virus because of inherent errors common in transcription of RNA. The prototype US virus is related to but distinct from the 1st European isolate (referred to as Lelystad virus) identified in the Netherlands. There are significant genetic and antigenic differences between these initial isolates. Genetic and antigenic variability between isolates, even within a country, remains a continuous challenge to control of the disease.

The PRRS virus is only moderately resistant to environmental degradation. The virus is easily inactivated by phenol, formaldehyde, and most common disinfectants. The virus has a predilection for cells of the immune system, including pulmonary intravascular macrophages (PIM) and pulmonary alveolar macrophages (PAM); in the latter it replicates extensively. Primary PAMs and a limited number of continuous cell culture systems are used in isolating and maintaining virus. Strains of PRRS virus vary markedly in virulence. The basis for virulence differences is not yet known. Protective epitopes are not described nor can they be predicted from genomic analysis. The virus often appears to interact with other pathogenic viruses, bacteria and _Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae_ to magnify severity of diseases.

Breeding age gilts, sows, and boars: clinical signs may include a period of anorexia, fever, lethargy, depression, and perhaps respiratory distress or vomiting. Mild cyanosis of the ears, abdomen, and vulva has been reported in some outbreaks. Reproductive problems, often the most obvious signs, include a decrease in the number of dams that conceive or farrow. There is usually an increase in premature farrowings, late term abortions, stillborn or weak piglets, and mummified fetuses. Preweaning mortality is high. Nursing pigs may have dyspnea ("thumping"). The period for reproductive signs varies with herd size but is usually 2 to 3 months in duration. A slow improvement in reproductive performance then begins. In larger operations, signs may be cyclical, especially if naive gilts or sows continue to be introduced into the herd. There is evidence that subpopulations within large breeding herds escape initial infection but are infected when exposed later and serve as sources of continued virus shedding. Also, herds may be infected with multiple, heterologous strains of PRRS virus that are not completely cross-protective. In boars, clinical signs are similar to sows and are accompanied by a decrease in semen quality.

Young, growing, and finishing pigs: primary clinical signs among young pigs are fever, depression, lethargy, stunting due to systemic disease, and pneumonia. Sneezing, fever, and lethargy are followed by expiratory dyspnea [difficult or labored breathing] and stunting. Peak age for respiratory disease is 4-10 pweeks. Postweaning mortality often is markedly increased, especially with more virulent strains and the occurrence of ever-present concurrent and secondary infections. Older pigs, especially naive, high-health swine, have similar respiratory signs. Heterologous infections may lead to prolonged or repeated outbreaks of respiratory disease.

There is no single successful strategy for control of PRRS, largely because of virus variation, large swine populations, and unresolved issues of transmission. In some smaller herds, immunity may be sufficient so that infection is not causing significant economic losses, in which case no intervention is necessary. Often, there are sufficient losses to consider some or all of the following points for control. A control program should be tailored to fit the individual farm situation.

Since the PRRS virus, the control strategies, and the specific farm situations are so variable, it is imperative that experienced practitioners, diagnosticians, and research workers continue to objectively expand their knowledge to better control and eventually eliminate this financially devastating disease.
