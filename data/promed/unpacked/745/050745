[This is another in the series of outbreaks on the island of
Sardinia. In 1998, there were 17 outbreaks of classical swine fever
(CSF) and in 1999 there were 6. CSF is endemic in the wild boar
population there and in Germany and sometimes spills over into
domestic pigs. Sardinia is also endemic for African Swine Fever. In
2000 and 2001, CSF outbreaks also occurred in other parts of Italy.
This OIE alert report does not specify domestic pigs, but one would
suspect this is spillover from a wild boar to small domestic pig
operations. OIE usually publishes details on Friday in their Disease
Information <http://www.oie.int/eng/info/hebdo/a_INFO.HTM>.
Outbreaks occurred in wild boar in Belgium, Luxembourg, France, and
Germany in recent years.
CSF is an important disease because of high mortality and ease of
spread. Europe has had its share of recent outbreaks in recent years,
with significant ones in the UK in 2000, Spain in 2001, and both the
Netherlands and Germany in 1997. In Eastern Europe, Bosnia and
Herzegovina, Macedonia, Slovakia, Croatia, Serbia and Montenegro, and
Russia have all had significant problems in recent years. We need a
better understanding of the mechanism of local spread to farms within
1 kilometer, because this is a factor in outbreaks once the disease
is established in domestic pig operations. - Mod.PC]
