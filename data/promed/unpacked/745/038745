Circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 - the Philippines - update 24 Oct 2019
---------------------------
On [27 Sep 2019], a circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (cVDPV1) was confirmed in environmental samples in the Philippines. The virus has been isolated from 10 environmental samples, all genetically related, which were collected from one sewage collection site and its tributary pumping stations in Manila, between [1 Jul 2019] and [23 Sep 2019]. This sewage collection site in the city of Manila has a catchment area of over 600 000 people.

Vaccine-derived polioviruses are rarely occurring forms of the poliovirus that have genetically changed from the attenuated (weakened) virus contained in oral polio vaccine. They only occur when the vaccine virus is allowed to pass from person to person for a long time, which can only happen in places with limited immunization coverage and inadequate sanitation and hygiene. Over time, as it is passed between more unimmunized people, it can regain the ability to cause disease. When the population is fully immunized with both oral polio vaccine and inactivated polio vaccine, this kind of transmission cannot take place. The gut immunity in people immunized with oral polio vaccine stops the virus from being passed on. Full immunization therefore protects against both vaccine-derived viruses and wild polioviruses.

Philippines reported its last indigenous wild poliovirus in 1993, and the country is currently having an ongoing circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) outbreak since September 2019. There has been persistently suboptimal immunization coverage for oral polio vaccine (OPV) and inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) in the country: 66% and 41%, respectively, in 2018.

Public health response
The Department of Health is coordinating the response activities, with the support of partners including the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) and WHO. Public health response measures include:

- Outbreak response with bivalent OPV in the National Capital Region, strengthened routine immunization activities including inactivated polio vaccine (IPV), and strengthening of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) and environmental surveillance.
- Polio outbreak investigation to determine the number and characteristics of cases and the context for environmental isolates, along with determining the geographic extent and assessing the risk of further transmission.
- Ongoing retrospective records review in health facilities to identify AFP cases for investigation.

WHO risk assessment
Given the subnational surveillance and immunity gaps and high levels of population movement within the country, the risk of national spread associated with this confirmed cVDPV1 is considered to be high.

The country is currently being affected by an ongoing cVDPV2 outbreak (please see the Disease outbreak news published on 24 Sep 2019 at https://www.who.int/csr/don/24-september-2019-polio-outbreak-the-philippines/en/).

WHO advice
Countries, territories, and areas should maintain uniformly high routine immunization coverage at the district level to minimize the consequences of any possible poliovirus introduction or transmission. It is important that all countries, in particular those with frequent travel links and contacts with polio-affected countries and areas, strengthen surveillance for AFP cases in order to rapidly detect any new virus importation and to facilitate a rapid response.

WHO's International Travel and Health recommends that all travellers and residents in polio-affected areas be fully vaccinated against polio. Residents (and visitors for more than 4 weeks) from infected areas should receive an additional dose of oral polio vaccine (OPV) or inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) within 4 weeks to 12 months of travel.

As per the advice of an Emergency Committee convened under the International Health Regulations (2005), efforts to limit the international spread of poliovirus remains a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). Countries affected by poliovirus transmission are subject to Temporary Recommendations. To comply with the Temporary Recommendations issued under the PHEIC, any country infected by poliovirus should declare the outbreak as a national public health emergency and consider vaccination of all international travellers.

UNICEF-WHO Philippines: Polio Outbreak Situation Report no. 5 (25 Oct 2019)
----------------------------------
Highlights
- 1 new vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (VDPV2) case has been reported this week, a 4-year-old child from Datu Piang, Maguindanao, Mindanao. This is a newly infected province and represents an expansion of the outbreak in Mindanao.
- 4 new environmental samples also tested positive for poliovirus this week: 3 samples from Manila for VDPV1, and 1 sample from Quezon city for VDPV2 pending genetic sequencing.
- Another child from Maguindanao, a 3-year-old from Datu Paglas, was also confirmed with VPDV2. Synchronized polio vaccination campaigns are ongoing [14-27 Oct 2019] in the National Capital Region (NCR), Davao City, Davao del Sur, and Lanao del Sur in response to a polio outbreak declared by the Department of Health (DOH) on [19 Sep 2019].
- As of [24 Oct 2019], almost 1.5 million out of 1.7 million targeted children under 5 have been vaccinated. DOH supported by WHO and UNICEF is analysing coverage data daily and providing additional resources, support, and supervision to areas with the highest numbers of missed children.
- All regional health directors were convened for a Polio Emergency Consultation on 24-25 Oct [2019] to discuss improving acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) surveillance, lessons learned from the current vaccination round, and plans for new provinces to be included in the next round. Circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV) is considered a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC).

Current Situation
In Mindanao, one 4-year-old child from Datu Piang, Maguindanao, Mindanao, was confirmed with VDPV type 2 on [24 Oct 2019]. The sample showed 7.3% nucleotide divergence from Sabin vaccine virus and is confirmed to be genetically linked to the previous case from Lanao del Sur.

This is the 2nd human case categorised as positive for cVDPV2, as the case from Laguna is categorized as positive for immunodeficiency-related VDPV (iVDPV2). A 3rd child from Maguindano residing in Datu Paglas was confirmed testing positive for VDPV2 on [25 Oct 2019]. It has just been sent for genetic sequencing at the Global Specialized Laboratory National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID) in Japan.

The currently ongoing 1st round of vaccination in Mindanao has so far vaccinated 90% of the targeted number of 427 008 children under 5 in Davao City, Davao del Sur, and Lanao del Sur with monovalent OPV (mOPV), which protects against poliovirus type 2. The 2nd and 3rd round will target over 3.1 million children in all 6 regions of Mindanao. Besides the environmental samples from Davao, no further environmental samples have been tested positive in Mindanao (see Figure 2). In NCR, 3 new environmental samples were tested positive for cVDPV1, reaching a total of 10 positive samples (see Figure 1).

A 1st round of vaccination was conducted in Manila City on [19-31 Aug 2019] with bivalent oral polio vaccine (bOPV), which protects against poliovirus type 1 and 3. Only 53.8% of the targeted children up to 5 years old were vaccinated. The 2nd round of vaccination, which started on [14 Oct 2019], has so far vaccinated over 1.1 million children under 5: 87% of the target. The 3rd round of the campaign will be conducted from [25 Nov 2019] to [7 Dec 2019], targeting almost 1.3 million children.

All samples were tested by the National Polio Laboratory at the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM), whereas sequencing and genetic analysis were done at the NIID in Japan and additional genetic characterization provided by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The NIID and CDC confirmed that all VDPV1 samples were genetically linked but did not find a genetic linkage with any other known VDPV1 detected globally, indicating new emergence.

Comparison done at NIID and CDC in poliovirus databases showed the Laguna case is not genetically linked with any other known type 2 poliovirus, indicating new emergence. All other VDPV2 samples are genetically linked.

Response
Risk assessment
The current polio outbreak is not an unexpected event, as the Philippines was assessed as high risk for poliovirus transmission in the past years by the Western Pacific Regional Commission for Certification of Poliomyelitis Eradication (RCC), because of chronically suboptimal immunisation coverage, suboptimal performance of AFP surveillance, and poor sanitation and hygiene conditions.

The regional risk of potential spread across international borders is assessed as moderate, considering the large number of overseas Filipino workers (OFW). Although many OFW work globally, the risk of international spread is still considered low, but not negligible, further influenced by dynamic migratory patterns (particularly the USA).

[Details on the coordination of vaccination efforts, surveillance, and social mobilization activities can be found at the source URL. - Mod.MPP]

RCAs [rapid coverage assessments] also look for the reasons why children were not vaccinated during the initial round, as well as the information sources parents heard about the vaccination activity. In the Philippines, children were mostly not vaccinated because they were not at home (Table 3). Also, health workers and barangay officials have been most effective in raising awareness about the current polio vaccination event (Table 4).

[Reading both reports above, there are now 2 ongoing sites of transmission of cVDPV in the Philippines. One is occurring in the Metro Manila region and involves a cVDPV1 virus. To date, there have only been positive environmental samples, but no cases of AFP (acute flaccid paralysis) associated with this virus. The other outbreak involves a cVDPV2 virus with transmission in the Mindanao region involving 4 infected individuals with AFP. One of the 4 infected individuals has been classified as an immune-deficient (iVDPV) case, but the other 2 represent related cVDPV2 viruses, and the 3rd is pending characterization.

A map showing the targeted areas in the Philippines can be found on page 6 of the Situation Report.

Conclusion: Decreased vaccination coverages in the Philippines has resulted in growing pockets of susceptibles that permitted the circulation of the OPV1 virus in the National Capital Region (NCR) and the OPV2 virus in the southern Mindanao region of the country.

A map of the Philippines showing provinces can be found at http://mapsof.net/philippines/philippines-regions-and-provinces. The province of Lanao del Sur is located in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Mindanao. Davao is a province on Mindanao to the east of Lanao del Sur, and Manila is located in Central Luzon, significantly north of Mindanao. As mentioned previously, it is significantly noteworthy that Metro Manila is one of the most densely populated areas in the world. - Mod.MPP]
