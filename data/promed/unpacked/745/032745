During the last month, a significant number of malaria cases,
including black water fever, have been reported at the allied
hospitals in town.

According to data collected by The News, the District Headquarters
Hospital received over 50 patients with complications of malaria.
Benazir Bhutto Hospital received over 40 patients, while 35 plus
patients with malaria reached the Holy Family Hospital. Meanwhile,
some 22 cases of black water fever were reported at the allied
hospitals, of which 4 died of complications.

Most of the cases admitted at tertiary care hospitals with malaria are
with complications of the protozoal infection, said a medical
specialist serving at BBH on condition of anonymity. He added that
mosquitoes have increased in twin cities, which are causing malaria.

Registrar, Medicine Unit at BBH, Dr Umar Saeed was of the view that
overprescription of antimalarial drugs by local general physicians and
quacks along with self medication are major causes of the increase in
drug-resistant malaria cases.

Black water fever is an ancient term given to falciparum malaria in
which the colour of urine of a patient gets dark. Its symptoms include
high-grade fever on alternate days, fits, and shivering and black
urine. If left untreated, it may cause complications including organ
failure.

The onset of malaria should not be taken as non-serious, and patients
should avoid self-medication, said medical specialist at BBH Dr
Muhammad Mujeeb Khan while talking to The News on Thursday [25 Aug
2011]. He added that in case of having symptoms, a patient should
immediately consult a qualified physician to avoid complications of
the disease.

It is important to stress that the parasite causing malaria, once
injected into the blood by mosquito bite, reproduces into millions of
baby parasites that grow to adults within 2 hours and obstruct blood
flow in small arteries and veins, which might cause organ damage.

Dr Mujeeb said that, in case of improper medication, mutation occurs,
and the next generation of the protozoa causing malaria becomes drug
resistant. The best way to avoid malaria and its complications is to
avoid mosquito bites, he said.

He said that it is time to create awareness among the public that
malaria and dengue fever are caused by mosquito bites and that
preventive measures by individuals are required to prevent the
diseases. The concerned government authorities can eliminate
mosquitoes only in open spaces, while individuals should take measures
to eliminate mosquitoes in houses, said Dr Mujeeb.

[Rawalpindi and the neighboring city of Islamabad are usually regarded
as low risk areas for malaria.

The epidemiology of malaria in Pakistan has recently been reviewed:
Kakar Q, et al. Malaria control in Pakistan: new tools at hand but
challenging epidemiological realities. East Mediterr Health J.
2010;16(suppl):S54-60.

According to WHO's Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean
[EMRO], Pakistan had 1.5 million malaria cases in 2008 (latest
reported year) of which 24 per cent were _P. falciparum_
(http://www.emro.who.int/rbm/CountryProfiles-pak.htmhttp://www.emro.who.int/rbm/CountryProfiles-pak.htm).
The malaria control programme in Pakistan has struggled to contain the
infection, and a recent estimate from Integrated Regional Information
Networks [IRIN -- a service of the UN Office for the Coordination of
Humanitarian Affairs] found that only about 25 per cent of cases
receive qualified medical care and treatment
(http://www.irinnews.org/InDepthMain.aspx?InDepthId=10&ReportId=33684&Country=Yes).

Chloroquine resistance is widespread in Pakistan, and a recent study
(Ghanchi NK, et al. Prevalence of resistance associated polymorphisms
in _Plasmodium falciparum_ field isolates from southern Pakistan.
Malar J. 2011;28;10:18) found the pfcrt 76T mutation, recognized as a
marker of chloroquine resistance, in 93 per cent of samples.
Blackwater fever is caused by hemolysis and excretion of hemoglobin in
the urine.
