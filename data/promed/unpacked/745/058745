India to immunize 125 million children against polio.
India will launch the last phase of the world's biggest public health
program next month when it seeks to immunize 125 million children against
polio, organizers said Thursday. O.P. Vaish, chairman of India's PolioPlus
Committee, told a news conference the two-day drive December 7, 1997 and
January 18, 1998 would help wipe out "this crippling disease from the world
by 2000." Vaish said the program would involve 650,000 polio booths across
the country, more than 12 million workers and volunteers and 380 million
doses of the oral polio vaccine. "We are expecting we will reach zero polio
case status by the end of the century," he said. "China has already done
it, Sri Lanka has done it, why can't we?" Jon Kim Andrus of the World
Health Organization said: "This is the largest single-day immunization
event in the history of the world. But this is not enough. Surveillance
must be galvanized."
