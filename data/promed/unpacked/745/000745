An epidemic of an infectious disease affecting animals in the soum [district] Gurvansaikhan in the aimag [province] Dundgovi, has been confirmed by the State Veterinary Sanitation Laboratory.

In 3 soums of Dundgovi aimag -- Gurvansaikhan, Ulziit [Olziit] and Saintsagaan -- a state of high alertness has been declared. In addition, the soum governors were required to take measures to combat, prevent and control animal infectious diseases.

The Aimag's governor has established a working group to organize the measures required.

Though the name of the addressed animal disease could not be found (machine translation problem?), from the following item 2, published 2 days earlier, clearly, the disease is foot and mouth disease (FMD). - Mod.AS]

Livestock FMD has spread throughout the Songinokhairkhan district of the capital city [Ulaanbaatar]. In the aftermath of the epidemic of FMD, the Special Monitoring Agency of the Songinokhairkhan District, the General Emergency Authority, and the General Police Department jointly established an Emergency Commission.

The FMD situation has been highlighted by D. Altantuya, a specialist of the District Emergency Management:

Q. An Emergency Commission has been established to tackle FMD. Where are there outbreaks of the disease?

A. Indeed, an Emergency Commission (Order No. 01) has been active in the Songino Khairkhan District, working 24 hours a day. The 1st affected khoroo of the district was the 22nd khoroo [Ulaanbaatar is divided into 9 districts (Duuregs): Baganuur, Bagakhangai, Bayangol, Bayanzurkh, Chingeltei, Kha Songino n Uul, Nalaikh, Khairkhan and Sukhbaatar. Each district is subdivided into khoroos, of which there are 121. - Mod.AS]. A total of 109 cattle in 25 households were culled due to FMD.

Q. It is stated that the 21-day quarantine regime has been declared, preventing the population from entering or exiting the city.

A. Yes. A 21-day quarantine regime has been established due to FMD, and residents are not being introduced into the city. Professional organizations working in Golomt set up a fieldwork team at each point and set a quarantine regime on 24 Jul 2017. The veterinary department of the Capital City and the Buyan Hkhynag veterinary clinic are conducting daily cleaning and sanitation services for livestock establishments, stockades and transportation means.

Q. What advice will be given to warning citizens?

A. Citizens and herders need to be informed about any movements/migration of livestock to local professional organizations and veterinary hospitals and committees. Also, let's point out that the vaccination efforts need time. The District Governor's Office has distributed 3000 manuals and recommendations on FMD prevention to herders.

FMD is a viral infectious disease of livestock affecting animals which may infect humans. Specifically, it is a serious infectious disease transmitted through urine and saliva. Therefore, people need to pay attention to the use of raw dairy products and meat products.

The epidemic of animal infections is not only a problem in Mongolia, but also a global problem. In recent years, animal epidemics and regional epidemics have led to significant economic losses. The increasing number of infectious diseases every year and the emergence of new diseases are a challenge for us to improve the prevention and control of the disease and to reduce the risk of structured and preventive measures before the diagnosis of infectious diseases. It impedes barriers to international trade and closes the export of livestock and their raw products and negatively affects the income and livelihoods of herders and the country, aimag [provinces] and soum [districts] economies.

The final decision on the implementation of Phase 2 of the Mongolian Livestock Early Warning System was approved by the Prime Minister of Mongolia J. Erdenebat at the 21st International Economic Forum held in St. Petersburg, Russia. In June 2017, Minister of Agriculture and Light Industry P. Sergelen and Minister of Agriculture of the Russian Federation A.N. Tkakaev signed an agreement to supply 4 million doses of vaccine to Mongolia. The 1st consignment, including 1 300 700 doses of the A&O vaccine has been received today (31 Jul 2017).

Initial vaccination is planned to address sensitive and vulnerable animals in central and eastern regions in suspected and protected areas. In the future, the supply of remaining vaccines to Mongolia will be jointly organized by the Federation of Animal Health Protection and the Implementing Agency of the Veterinary and Breeding Agency of the government.

[The above media report includes pictures of Russian-sourced vaccine vials. The label on the vial, in Russian, provides the following information: FMD vaccine, bivalent, serotypes A and O. Dosage: For large animals (cattle, buffalo, camels, yak, pig) - 2 cc. For sheep, goats - 1 cc. The vial contains 100 doses for (the mentioned) large animals or 200 doses for small ruminants.

Mongolia reported to the OIE a new FMD outbreak, on its eastern region, on 13 Feb 2017. According to the report, the outbreak had started on 24 Jan 2017 and was confirmed on 28 Jan 2017, the causative agent being serotype O. One of the control measures undertaken was "Vaccination in response to the outbreak," addressing cattle, sheep and goats. No information on the manufacturer of the vaccine used or on the vaccine strain included in the applied vaccine, became available. This may have been a different manufacturer, namely not the (current) Russian one.

Genotyping of the January 2017 strain from Mongolia was carried out at Pirbright (WRLFMD), indicating that the causative agent in 2017 was serotype O, topotype ME-SA, lineage "PanAsia" (see, including a dendogram and most closely related prototype sequences, at http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/2017/WRLFMD-2017-00010-Mongolia-O-approved.pdf).

Clearly, as apparent from the recent media reports, FMD has widely spread in Mongolia, from the east westwards and northwards.

The following information on Mongolia's FMD situation was published in page 7 of EUFMD's Global Monthly report for June 2017, available at http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/user_upload/eufmd/docs/FMD_monthly_reports/2017/June2017.pdf:

"FMDV serotypes A and O were detected in 10 of the 16 samples collected between March 2015 and April 2017, of which one was from a sheep and the remaining from cattle.

"Genotyping of the VP1 of the detected viruses identified the following lineages: A/ASIA/SEA-97, and O/SEA/Mya-98, and O/ME-SA/PanAsia. All the genotypes detected in the present batch of samples were already circulating in the country.

"The most recent VMSD tests available were carried out on 2 of the most recently detected genotypes obtaining the following results:
1. For A/ASIA/SEA-97 conducted on field isolates A/MOG/11/2013 and A/MOG/13/2013, good matching results were obtained with vaccine strains A Iran05, A 22IRQ and A TUR/06.
2. For O/SEA/Mya-98 conducted on field isolates O/MOG/2/2015 and O/MOG/5/2015, good matching results were obtained with vaccine strains O 3039 and O/TUR/5/2009 but not for O Manisa."

Matching trials for the O/ME-SA/PanAsia strain, currently circulating in Mongolia, are urgently needed. It is not clear whether the vaccination applied during the 1st half of 2017 has conferred protection.

The last follow-up report (No. 2) on FMD in Mongolia was submitted to the OIE on 27 Apr 2017, when the accumulated number of outbreaks was 16. The reports, and a map showing the 16 outbreaks in the east, are available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=22811.

A new, updated follow-up report is long overdue. - Mod.AS
