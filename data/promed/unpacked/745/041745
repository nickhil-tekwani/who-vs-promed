The report states that Dr Earl Green of Maryland, USA, found an unknown
species of parasite in the skin of frogs found dead in the jungles of
Panama in Dec.1996 and collected by Dr Karen Lips of St Lawrence
University, Canton, New York. There was no obvious pathology. The theory
put forward is that the parasite damages the oxygen-absorbing ability of
the frog's skin and also allows dehydration. The parasite is said to
resemble a known parasite that kills oysters (name not given). It is now
thought to be responsible for the wave of deaths of tropical frogs that has
been spreading south from Costa Rica since it was first noticed there in
1988, and may have already reached Nicaragua.
Up to 1987 there were hundreds of thousands of golden toads in the
Monteverde Reserve of Costa Rica. In 1989, only 5 were left, and it has
not been seen since. Twenty other species of frogs and toads have
disappeared from the region since then.
The report states that an Australian pathologist has found a similar
parasite in frogs in Queensland, which have been dying of unexplained
causes since the 1980s. It also says frog declines have been noticed on all
continents starting about 15 years ago.
