Officials say two crows found dead in the Albany area over the past couple
of weeks were carrying West Nile virus, which has been connected to the
encephalitis outbreak in the New York City area. No people in the capital
region [Albany is the capital of New York State.- Mod.CHC have been shown
to have the disease, but officials are very concerned to know that wildlife
show signs of it.

[Not surprising in view of the discovery of West Nile virus in Saratoga,
New York, which, memory serves, is about 20 miles north of Albany. In the
spring, when C.D.C. and the involved states make some headway in the
planned bird serosurvey, we should know a great deal more about the
geographic distribution of West Nile virus in the USA. Meanwhile, unless a
message contains new information regarding the discovery of evidence of the
presence of West Nile virus outside the known area, we will not post the
occurrence of each dead crow on the eastern seaboard. - Mod.CHC
