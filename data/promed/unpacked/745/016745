2000/043 Soilborne wheat mosaic diseases: new viruses are being described
(edited by Moderator DH)
Soilborne virus diseases of wheat can be caused by different viruses. The
main viruses involved are soilborne wheat mosaic bymovirus and wheat
spindle streak mosaic bymovirus (closely related or identical to wheat
yellow mosaic bymovirus) which are transmitted by the soil-inhabiting
fungus _Polymyxa graminis_ and occur in many countries from various parts
of the world. In France, these two viruses are present, essentially in the
south-east of Paris Basin, region Centre, Gard, and south of Brittany.
Resistant wheat cultivars can be grown in infested areas, and so far no
resistance-breaking strains have been observed. In 1999 in the department
of Aube, mosaic symptoms were observed on resistant cultivars (_Triticum
aestivum_ cvs. Sponsor, Charger). Electron microscopy revealed the presence
of a virus, which is serologically distinct from wheat soilborne mosaic and
wheat spindle streak mosaic bymoviruses. The field distribution of the
disease suggested soil transmission, but so far, _Polymyxa graminis_, the
fungal vector of both viruses, was not detected in roots of infected
plants. Nematodes, as possible virus vectors, were not found. This
apparently new virus has tentatively been called Aubiane wheat mosaic virus.
Two other new viruses, soilborne rye mosaic virus in Germany, which is
transmitted by _P. graminis_ and of a unnamed virus found in England are
under investigation. Concerning the latter, Clover et al. (1999) reported
that an unknown disease of wheat has been observed on winter wheat (cv.
Riband) in a crop in Bedfordshire, England, since 1995. A virus was found
to be associated with diseased plants. It is morphologically similar to
soilborne wheat mosaic bymovirus but serologically distinct. This new virus
is seed-transmitted and its distribution pattern in the field suggested
soil transmission but vectors are not known. Moreover, a new soilborne
virus, wheat China mosaic virus, has recently been described in China (EPPO
Alert List).

[According to Hariri et al., Aubiane wheat mosaic virus (AWMV) appears to
be distinct from several viruses that infect wheat (wheat soilborne mosaic
furovirus, wheat spindle streak bymovirus, oat golden stripe furovirus,
barley stripe mosaic hordeivirus). The authors suggest that AWMV may be
similar to the virus infecting winter wheat in Bedfordshire. The fact that
the Bedfordshire virus is seed-transmitted is interesting. Of the 14
viruses in the VIDE Plant Viruses Online database, only wheat streak mosaic
rymovirus is known to be seed-transmitted, and that is at very low levels.
