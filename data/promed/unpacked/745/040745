[The H5N1 outbreak in wild birds appears to have extended its range
to include Western Mongolia. Previous reports have located an H5N1
virus in both Russia and Kazakhstan, some 1000 km further west. It
would be very important to determine whether all 3 outbreaks have a
similar genetic composition to the causative virus. - Mod.PC]
