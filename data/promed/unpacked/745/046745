Tularemia, Stavropol region, Russia
------------------------------------
Since the beginning of 2005, 9 inhabitants of the Stavropol region
have developed tularemia, including 8 adults and a 13-year-old, based
on reports from the Regional Epidemiological Surveillance Center.
All infected persons were inhabitants of the Petrovskiy, Shpakovskiy
and Ipatovskiy districts of the Stavropol region and the city of
Stavropol. They were all hunters or members of a hunter's family and
were thought to have acquired the bacterial infection from exposure
to the carcasses of animals (hares).
In the Stavropol region annual outbreaks of tularemia have been
reported since 2003. Prior to 2003, the last case of disease was
reported in 1998.

[This area is in southwestern Russia. Although the manifestations of
illness in these reported cases of tularemia are not stated, it is
likely that most, if not all of the cases, were glandular (lymph node
involvement) or ulceroglandular (skin ulcer and draining lymph node
disease). - Mod.LL]
