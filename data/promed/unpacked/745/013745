-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Though most of the hemorrhagic septicaemia (HS) outbreaks are related
to high temperature and humidity (monsoon season), this might not be
the case in the present circumstances. Another contributing factor,
which might be considered is the immunosuppressive effect of other
pathogens, which may be responsible either for a direct failure of
the immune system of non-vaccinated animals, or for a deficient
immune response of HS- and/or FMD-vaccinated animals.

Amongst these pathogens (of which FMD [foot-and-mouth disease] virus
has already been quoted), for a long time _Trypanosoma evansi_ has
been suspected (a suspicion partially demonstrated in experimental
conditions) to be responsible for direct immune failure or (HS and
FMD) vaccination failure.

Might this be the case in the present outbreak? Is information on the
_T. evansi_ infection status of bovines in the affected herds available?

I would be pleased to contribute any support needed for the diagnosis
of _T. evansi_ infection.

[Surra (_Trypanosoma evansi_) is an OIE-listed disease, included in
the "multi-species" group.

Other pathogens which may be immunosuppressive in bovines include,
among others, bovine virus diarrhea (BVD), enzootic bovine leukosis
(EBL), Jembrana disease virus (JDV), bovine respiratory syncytial
virus... - Mod.AS]
