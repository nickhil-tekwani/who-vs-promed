The death toll from gastroenteritis has reached 39 in Rupandehi district,
western Nepal, in less than two weeks, the official RSS news agency
reported Thursday. Twenty-six people in this district had succumbed to the
disease in one week by Monday. RSS said that another 1,110 people are
reported to be suffering from the disease, which has assumed epidemic
proportions in 13 village development committees of the district. Local
hospitals are under growing pressure due to lack of rooms and medicine, the
news agency said. It said that continued consumption of contaminated water
and fingerlings has helped spread further the disease. The health ministry
said that 840 people around the country had died of the disease from
mid-April to October 12.
