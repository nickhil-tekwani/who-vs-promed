Until a couple of months ago, it was the most asked question: who brought
bird flu to India and from where?
The High Security Animal Disease Laboratory (HSADL) is ready with the
answer and many more interesting revelations. Scientists at the Bhopal lab
say migratory birds carried the deadly virus from China -- after a detour
of Europe and West Asia. After detailed research work for more than 2
months, they found the origin and source of the virus and the method of its
introduction into India. A study of the gene sequences (HA1 and HA2) of the
virus, isolated from the Navapur and Jalgaon outbreaks, concluded that the
viruses originated from Qinghai (central China) and Jiangxi (south China).
HSADL joint director in-charge H.K. Pradhan says the findings shatter a
common belief: that the outbreaks at Navapur and Jalgaon (140 km away) in
Maharashtra were related. He says genetic analysis revealed that the
viruses from Navapur and Jalgaon were not identical (they showed 3.5 per
cent divergence). This points to the fact that the 2 outbreaks were
independent from each other and were caused by different sources.
Study is on to identify the other [source], says Pradhan. Another
interesting finding: Jalgaon was the first to be hit and not Navapur -- as
widely believed. Though the outbreak at Jalgaon was reported 12 days after
Navapur (18 Feb 2006), its virus had evolved earlier, says Pradhan. Since
the Jalgaon outbreak was in backyard poultry (involving scattered deaths),
it was reported later than the Navapur outbreak in which a large number of
birds in organised poultry farms died.
That was also the reason why it took more time in Jalgaon to control the
disease, as it had spread far and wide. Pradhan says probably the Navapur
virus was responsible for the outbreak in Uchhal in Gujarat, and the
Jalgaon virus for the Burhanpur outbreak in Madhya Pradesh.
Scientists are working on this theory. For now, the lab says bird flu that
led to culling of millions of poultry birds and a scare has been tamed in
the country. It has not detected any fresh positive cases in the last 2 months.
Animal husbandry secretary H.M.A. Hakeem on Monday said he was yet to get
the details of the lab's findings. "I don't know about it. As far as I
know, the department of animal husbandry hasn't been informed," he said.
Animal husbandry commissioner S.K. Bandhopadhyay said blaming the outbreak
on just migratory birds would mean ruling out other sources. Other options
such like smuggled infected birds, contaminated feed and bird products
cannot be ruled out. For example, in Africa, the FAO has ruled out
migratory birds as a source of infection and are examining other sources,
he said.

better, it seems that the field ("shoe leather") epidemiology gets weaker
and weaker. We need better trained people in the field these days. - Mod.MHJ]
