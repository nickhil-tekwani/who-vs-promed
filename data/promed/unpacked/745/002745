I've been hearing about CCPP [contagious caprine pleuropneumonia] entering
Tanzania, as well. Can anybody confirm or deny?

Thanks for your message of 1/5 re CCPP in Tanzania. I have no immediate
information to confirm or deny the presence of the disease. At present we
are severely hampered by heavy rains and virtually impassable roads. We
certainly have been experiencing something fairly drastic as some flocks
have suffered 50% + mortality rates, but there has not been any proper
follow up to establish the exact cause. We remain in need of some serious
and well planned donor assistance to do just that. I am not sure who would
be the best authority for you to contact re this query but I will get back
to after my planned visit to Dar es Salaam where I hope to find out!!
I have copied this message to Titus Mlengeya [Regional Vet Officer] whom I
have at last made contact with. I hope that this will serve to open the
channel of communication between you both!!

[This area was earlier diagnosed with Nairobi sheep disease and some Rift
Valley fever. Until we have hard information, this Namibian query of CCPP in
Tanzania is nothing more than that. Maybe someone in Tanzania or Kenya can
provide us with harder information. - Mod.MHJ]
