Background information on enteropathogenic _E. coli_ in Japan
------------------------------------------------
_Escherichia coli_ accounted for 3.5 percent of all food-related outbreaks
during 1971 to 1990. 10 outbreaks of _E. coli_ food poisoning involved 1391
children during 1984 to 1994. 179 outbreaks of enteropathogenic _E. coli_
infection (14 488 cases) were reported in 1996; 176 outbreaks (5407 cases)
in 1997; 301 outbreaks (3876 cases) in 1998.
VTEC:
VTEC infection rates peak during July to August. 52 percent of patients are
in the age group 6 to 15. Only 3 cases of EHEC infection were reported
during 1979 to 1983; 410 (353 of these _E. coli_ O157:H7) during 1984 to
1995 - including a kindergarten outbreak in 1990 (319 cases, 2 fatal
hemolytic uremic syndrome [HUS. 232 sporadic cases of hemolytic uremic
syndrome were reported during 1983 to 1995.
68 sporadic cases and 79 outbreak-associated cases of shiga toxin-producing
enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ [VTEC were reported during January 1992 to
July 1993. 29 cases of hemolytic uremic syndrome associated with VTEC were
reported during 1991 to 1994.
From 1991 to 1995, 6783 isolates of enteropathogenic _E. coli_ were
recovered (351 of these characterized as VTEC). _E. coli_ O157:H7
accounted for 83 percent of EHEC during 1991 to 1995; 76 percent in 1996;
67 percent in 1997; 64 percent in 1998; 55 percent in 1999. The most
common types accounting for the remainder of cases are O26 and O111.
A total of 17 877 cases of VTEC O157 (including 16 outbreaks of 10-or-more
patients, 1808 hospitalized, and 12 fatalities) were reported in 1996. 76
percent of all patients were under age 15. Details follow:
12 outbreaks of VTEC O157 infection (10 or more cases) involving 2031 cases
and 3 deaths occurred during May 28 to July 27, 1996 in Okayama, Gifu,
Hiroshima, Aichi, Fukuoka, Osaka, Tokyo, Gunma and Kyoto. The largest of
these outbreaks (Sakai) is discussed below.
An outbreak of _E. coli_ O157 infection (468 cases in Oku-cho,
Okayamoa) occurred in May 1996. Later outbreaks occurred in Gifu (364
cases), Hiroshima, Aishi, Fukuoaka, Okayhama, (Nimi City - 191 cases),
Osaka, Tokyo & Gunma (during June 1996).
During July to August, 1996 an outbreak in Sakai (Osaka) involved
5727 school children, staff members, and secondary contact cases - with
additional cases in Habikino, Kyoto and Hashimoto (Wakayama). 101 cases of
hemolytic-uremic syndrome were registered during the outbreak. The epidemic
was variously ascribed to contaminated sea eels, water, radish sprouts
(kaiware daikon), water cress, or wheat noodles (udon).
A subsequent outbreak during late 1996 occurred in Morioka City, and
involved 212 students and teachers (5 hospitalized).
Total cases of EHEC O157 infection for 1997 numbered 1576, including 3
outbreaks (none with fatal cases). In March 1997, a cluster of 96 cases (53
hospitalized; 1 fatal) of EHEC O157 infection was reported in the central
region (Tokyo, Yokohama and Nagoya) - radish sprouts implicated.
In June 1997, a hospital outbreak among staff and patients in Okayama
involved 58 cases, none with HUS.
Ten outbreaks and 2077 cases of enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ infection were
reported nationwide in 1998. These figures include an outbreak of _E. coli_
026:H11 infection (132 cases) at a nursery school in Toyama Prefecture
during 1998.
7 outbreaks and 2990 cases were reported in 1999.
An outbreak of at least 41 cases of _E. coli_ O157 infection (source
unknown) were reported in a nursing home in Kanagawa in 2000.
EAEC:
2697 schoolchildren developed diarrhea due to enteroaggregative _E. coli_
contaminating school lunches in Gifu in 1993.
