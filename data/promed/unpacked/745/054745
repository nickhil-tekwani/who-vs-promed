A nasal antiviral created by researchers has blocked transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in ferrets, suggesting that the nasal spray could also prevent infection in people exposed to the new coronavirus. The compound in the spray -- a lipopeptide -- developed by researchers at the Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons (New York, NY, USA) is designed to prevent the new coronavirus from entering host cells. The researchers had previously created similar lipopeptides -- small proteins joined to a cholesterol or tocopherol molecule -- to prevent infection of cells by other viruses, including measles, parainfluenza, and Nipah viruses. The lipopeptides work by preventing a virus from fusing with its host's cell membrane, a necessary step that enveloped viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, use to infect cells. To fuse, the new coronavirus unfolds its spike protein before contracting into a compact bundle that drives the fusion. The compound designed by the researchers recognizes the SARS-CoV-2 spike, wedges itself into the unfolded region, and prevents the spike protein from adopting the compact shape necessary for fusion.

In the ferret experiments, the lipopeptide was delivered into the noses of 6 ferrets. Pairs of treated ferrets were then housed with 2 control ferrets that received a saline nasal spray and one ferret infected with SARS-CoV-2. After 24 hours of intense direct contact among the ferrets, tests revealed that none of the treated ferrets caught the virus from their infected cagemate and their viral load was precisely zero, while all of the control animals were highly infected.

The new nasal lipopeptide could be ideal for halting the spread of COVID-19. The antiviral lipopeptide is inexpensive to produce, has a long shelf life, and does not require refrigeration. These features make it stand out from other antiviral approaches under development, including monoclonal antibodies. The transportable and stable compound could be especially key in rural, low-income, and hard-to-reach populations. The researchers have proposed that these peptides could be used in any situation where an uninfected person would be exposed, whether in a household, school, healthcare setting, or community. The antiviral is easily administered and, based on the scientists' experience with other respiratory viruses, protection would be immediate and last for at least 24â€‰hours. The scientists hope to rapidly advance the preventative approach to human trials with the goal of containing transmission during this pandemic. People who cannot be vaccinated or do not develop immunity will particularly benefit from the spray.

"Even in an ideal scenario with large segments of the population vaccinated -- and with full trust in and compliance with vaccination procedures -- these antivirals will form an important complement to protect individuals and control transmission," said the researchers.

[The advantages of this nasal spray are that it is inexpensive to produce, has a long shelf life, and does not require refrigeration. It is particularly valuable to individuals who cannot be vaccinated or do not develop immunity. Protection is immediate and lasts 24 hrs. But while the results are promising, to date the tests have only been conducted with ferrets. Nonetheless, ferrets are excellent models. "Respiratory illnesses in ferrets resemble those in humans because they have a similarly proportioned respiratory tract, with relatively large lungs compared to the rest of their body. (Mice, for instance, don't: They have tiny lungs in a short torso.) ...Like humans, they have 5 lung lobes and branched-out airways in their lungs, and a comparable distribution of receptors that viruses bind to in their upper and lower respiratory tracts. They cough and sneeze and pass on their respiratory illnesses to nearby ferrets, mimicking human modes of transmission. Importantly, their immune systems have similarities to ours, making them a good model. (https://undark.org/2020/04/25/ferrets-covid-19/). - Mod.LK]

[2] China (Shandong): frozen food
Date: Tue 10 Nov 2020 2:28 PM MYT
Source: The Star, China Daily News/Asia News Network (ANN)/Reuters report [edited]
https://www.thestar.com.my/aseanplus/aseanplus-news/2020/11/10/china-steps-up-covid-19-disinfection-rules-for-imported-frozen-food-after-tianjin-case


China is doubling down on efforts to stem the transmission of the coronavirus through imported cold products, requiring thorough disinfection of such shipments before they come into contact with domestic workers. The heightened precautions were announced in a notice, released by the State Council's Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism on Monday [9 Nov 2020], after Tianjin reported a confirmed case of COVID-19 -- a worker at a local frozen food company -- on Sunday [8 Nov 2020].

A string of domestic infection clusters this year [2020] have been linked to cold-chain imported food. With regular nucleic acid tests in place on imported cold goods and workers involved in handling them, the notice highlights the significance of comprehensive disinfection of storage facilities, transport vehicles, and packages of the products. Sellers of cold-chain imported food must present disinfection certificates before their products are allowed to enter the market, according to the document.

In order to reduce disruption to normal logistics and supplies, disinfection should be carried out after nucleic acid samples from overseas products are collected, and should be conducted only once in most cases, it said. "Disinfection service providers should record their work in detail and the records and paperwork should be kept for at least 2 years," it added. The document also stresses improving the capability of tracing the origin and flow of cold-storage products and investigating and holding shipments from unspecified sources. "The goal is to be safe, efficient, speedy, and economical," it said. "While ensuring the safety of imported cold products, we are also aiming to increase efficiency during customs clearance, avoid backlogs, and secure the stability of the industry chain."

Global experts have long suspected the virus' ability to travel and be transmitted through cold-chain products, but evidence has not been easy to nail down. The Chinese mainland has detected at least 16 cases involving frozen imports testing positive for the presence of the novel coronavirus since July [2020], prompting customs officials to ramp up supervision over foreign goods and suspend imports from a number of manufacturers.

In October [2020], the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention said it isolated living novel coronavirus on the outer packaging of frozen food when investigating the source of an outbreak in Qingdao, Shandong province. The discovery, a world first, proved that contact with frozen food packaging contaminated by live virus could cause infection. Later that month [October 2020], a Chinese research team consisting of university researchers and CDC experts concluded from epidemiologic history and data analysis that the outbreak that took place in Beijing in June [2020] was likely to have been triggered by imported seafood, and cold-chain transportation could be a new route of transmission for the virus.

The confirmed patient in Tianjin is a loading dock worker who handled frozen pork from Germany [Bremen, from https://www.dw.com/en/german-frozen-pork-prompts-new-coronavirus-case-in-china/a-55545155] that arrived in Tianjin on [19 Oct 2020]. The shipment, part of which was sent to Shandong, tested positive for the virus on Saturday [7 Nov 2020].

The Tianjin government said on Monday evening [9 Nov 2020] that it found a new asymptomatic patient on Monday [9 Nov 2020] -- a truck driver who lugged goods from a frozen storage cluster in the city's Binhai New Area on Thursday [5 Nov 2020]. The patient with the previously confirmed case also worked there but handled a different set of goods. Gu Qing, deputy director of the Tianjin Health Commission, said 2 areas in the Binhai New Area would be classified as a medium-risk region starting on Monday midnight [9-10 Nov 2020]. Other parts of the city remained at low-risk.

All 70 000-plus residents of the medium-risk area will take nucleic acid tests overnight and those who intend to leave for essential reasons must present nucleic acid test results taken within 7 days, he added.

Liang Chunzao, deputy director of the Binhai area, said all 364 workers at the affected cold storage cluster have been tracked down and their test results were negative. The area is home to 39 cold storage facilities, housing 126 000 metric tons of cold-chain products, according to Liang. "We have assembled a joint testing team in order to complete nucleic acid tests on all cold imports as soon as possible," she said.

Meanwhile, in Shanghai, the 8717 individuals related to the confirmed local COVID-19 case reported in Shanghai on Monday [9 Nov 2020] have tested negative for the virus, the Shanghai municipal government announced on Tuesday [10 Nov 2020]. 26 individuals who have had close contact with the confirmed case and the 186 people who have interacted with these individuals have also been quarantined at designated hotels, according to the authorities.

[This is yet another transmission event in China felt to be related to SARS-CoV-2 exposure from contaminated frozen foods. In August 2020 there was a report from China identifying live SARS-CoV-2 on frozen food from 3 different cities: Shenzhen (Guangdong) had frozen chicken wings from Brazil, Wuhu identified the virus in frozen shrimp from Ecuador, and Yantai on frozen seafood packaging from a "foreign ship" (COVID-19 update (358): New Zealand, China contaminated imported food, WHO, global 20200814.7676661). The Beijing outbreak (June/July 2020), virus was identified on imported frozen salmon and salmon cutting boards in the Xinfadi market felt to be the main focus of enhanced transmission (COVID-19 update (329): China seafood plant, ACEIs & ARBs, WHO, global 20200724.7606897). In the Quindao (Shandong) outbreak, again virus was identified on frozen food although the outbreak was noted to be associated with a Pulmonary Hospital that treated SARS-CoV-2 infected patients returning to China from overseas.

The Chinese have been the only country identifying frozen food contamination as a source of transmission. Han et al propose that frozen foods should be considered as possible sources of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Having done a PubMed and MedRxiv search for published or pre-published articles addressing frozen foods and transmission of the SARS-CoV-2, the only reference I found was the Han article. Nevertheless, in September 2020, the Chinese strongly recommended that food importations from countries with active SARS-CoV-2 transmission be avoided (https://edition.cnn.com/2020/09/28/asia/china-coronavirus-frozen-food-intl-hnk/index.html).

ref: Selhorst P, Van Ierssel S, Michiels J, et al. Symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 re-infection of a health care worker in a Belgian nosocomial outbreak despite primary neutralizing antibody response. MedRxiv preprint doi: 10.1101/2020.11.05.20225052
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Background
It is currently unclear whether SARS-CoV-2 re-infection will remain a rare event, only occurring in individuals who fail to mount an effective immune response, or whether it will occur more frequently when humoral immunity wanes following primary infection.

Methods
A case of re-infection was observed in a Belgian nosocomial outbreak involving 3 patients and 2 health care workers. To distinguish re-infection from persistent infection and detect potential transmission clusters, whole genome sequencing was performed on nasopharyngeal swabs of all individuals including the re-infection case's 1st episode. IgA, IgM, and IgG and neutralizing antibody responses were quantified in serum of all individuals, and viral infectiousness was measured in the swabs of the reinfection case.

Results
Re-infection was confirmed in a young, immunocompetent health care worker as viral genomes derived from the 1st and 2nd episode belonged to different SARS-CoV-2 clades. The symptomatic re-infection occurred after an interval of 185 days, despite the development of an effective humoral immune response following symptomatic primary infection. The 2nd episode, however, was milder and characterized by a fast rise in serum IgG and neutralizing antibodies. Although contact tracing and virus culture remained inconclusive, the health care worker formed a transmission cluster with 3 patients and showed evidence of virus replication but not of neutralizing antibodies in her nasopharyngeal swabs.

Conclusion
If this case is representative of most COVID-19 patients, long-lived protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 might not be likely.

[The authors cite 8 prior confirmed episodes of reinfection in "Hong Kong [3], the USA [4,5], Belgium [6], the Netherlands [7], Ecuador [8], and India [9]." (references available at the source URL above). Of these, the Hong Kong report and this report are the only 2 having identified SARS-CoV-2 clade differences between the 1st and 2nd episodes, and the time between the events in both cases was significantly longer further ruling out a prolonged infection. In both the Hong Kong case and this current case, the 2nd episode was milder (the Hong Kong case had an asymptomatic infection the 2nd time). Yes, 2nd infections do occur, but their frequency remains to be seen (especially as more time passes) and the immunology surrounding these infections needs to be further defined. Perhaps healthcare workers could be followed with serial serology following infections as they remain at high risk of infection (and presumably re-infection) to actually follow neutralizing antibodies, IgG, IgM, and IgA, and perhaps identify if there are more asymptomatic reinfections, which may not be a bad outcome and may not bode darkly for vaccine efficacy concerns unless they are high shedders of infectious virus. Right now the data are sparse and consist of isolated case reports. - Mod.MPP]

[A] Weekly epidemiological update
Date: Tue 10 Nov 2020

https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/weekly-epidemiological-update---10-november-2020


Data as received by WHO from national authorities, as of 10am CEST 8 Nov 2020

Global epidemiological situation
--------------------------------
In the past week, the global number of cases of COVID-19 has increased by 8% compared to the previous week, totalling more than 3.6 million new cases, while new deaths have increased by 21% to over 54 000. This brings the cumulative numbers to over 49.7 million reported cases and over 1.2 million deaths globally since the start of the pandemic. The European Region continues to account for the greatest proportion of new cases and deaths in the past 7 days, the Region reported over half (54%) of all new cases and nearly half (47%) of new deaths. Although it still accounts for only 2% of the global total number of cases and deaths, this week the Western Pacific Region showed the largest relative proportional increase in new cases (19%) compared to the previous week followed by the Eastern Mediterranean Region (18%) and the European region (11%). The 3 regions reporting the highest proportional increases in newly reported deaths in the past 7 days compared to the previous week are Europe (44%), Africa (30%) and the Eastern Mediterranean (23%). The Western Pacific Region was the only region to report a decrease in deaths (5%) this week compared to the previous week.

The 5 countries reporting the highest number of cases in the past week were: The United States of America, France, India, Italy, and the United Kingdom.

Figure 2. COVID-19 cases per million population reported in the last 7 days by countries, territories and areas, [2 Oct 2020] through [8 Nov 2020].

Situation by WHO region
-----------------------
- African Region
The number of new cases continues to increase very gradually in the African Region, which reported nearly 34 000 new cases and 831 new deaths in the past week. The number of new deaths reported in the last 7 days was 30% higher than it was in the previous week, driven largely by increases seen in South Africa, Kenya, and Uganda.

South Africa continues to report the highest number of new cases and deaths in the Region, accounting for nearly a third of new cases and over half of new deaths. The number of new cases reported by South Africa peaked mid-July [2020], the height of winter, when there were more than 86 000 cases reported weekly. By September [2020], South Africa was reporting fewer than 15 000 cases per week, and in the past week there were nearly 10 500 cases reported (176 new cases per million population). The number of deaths has also fallen from over 1500 deaths per week at the end of July [2020] and beginning of August [2020], to 513 deaths reported in the past week (although this is 55% higher than it was in the previous week). As of [31 Oct 2020], 5 provinces reported over 80% of cases: Gauteng, KwaZulu-Natal, Western Cape, Eastern Cape, and Free State. The median age of COVID-19 cases in South Africa is 39 years, and 58% of cases are female. The reason for this higher prevalence among females could be due to females being more represented in certain occupations in education and health sectors where they may be at greater risk of infection, as well as differences in health seeking behavior.

Kenya is reporting the 2nd- highest number of weekly new cases in the African Region. The number of new cases rose at the end of July [2020], with 4700 cases in the week beginning [27 Jul 2020]. The number of cases then has risen considerably in October [2020], rising from 1000 new cases in the 1st week of October ([28 Sep 2020-4 Oct 2020]) to 6577 cases (122 new cases per million) in the past week.

Figure 3: Number of COVID-19 cases and deaths reported weekly by the WHO African Region, as of [8 Nov 2020].

- Region of the Americas
The Region of the Americas reported over 1 million new cases in the last week, a 3% increase as compared to the previous past week. The Region accounted for 32% of all deaths reported globally in the past week (n=17 289). The United States of America, Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, and Mexico reported the highest number of new cases in the last 7 days.

Brazil has reported over 5.6 million cumulative cases and over 162 000 cumulative deaths since the beginning of the pandemic. The number of cases reported per week peaked in the week of [27 Jul 2020] at 319 119 cases and has gradually decreased since then, although the absolute number remains high. In the last week Brazil reported 114 523 new cases and 2538 deaths which represent 30% and 16% decreases respectively compared to the previous week. The Southeast region of the country reported the highest cumulative numbers of cases and deaths with over 1.9 million cases and 73 261 deaths, followed by the Northeast region with over 1.4 million cases and 42 480 deaths, as of [4 Nov 2020]. In Rio de Janeiro, businesses, beaches, private schools, and nurseries have reopened with restrictions.

Martinique reported the highest surge in cases since the beginning of the pandemic in the week beginning [26 Oct 2020], with 1024 cases reported. In the past week, 397 new cases (1058 new cases per 1 million population) were reported, which is a 61% decrease compared to the previous week. This decrease was the 1st downward trend in weekly cases since the week beginning [21 Sep 2020]. On [30 Oct 2020], movement and travel restrictions were instated to limit contact and travel in Martinique. Schools, excluding higher education institutions, remain open with reinforced public health measures.

In Belize, the number of new cases reported surpassed 500 for the 1st time since the beginning of the outbreak, with 554 new cases and 9 new deaths reported in the past week bringing the total deaths in the country to 67. As of [8 Nov 2020], approximately 45% of confirmed cases were female, and the highest number of cases were reported from Orange Walk district followed by Belize district.

Figure 4: Number of COVID-19 cases and deaths reported weekly by the WHO Region of the Americas, as of [8 Nov 2020].

- Eastern Mediterranean Region
In the Eastern Mediterranean Region, the weekly number of new cases increased by 18% compared to the previous week, bringing the cumulative number of cases to over 3.3 million. In the past week, the number of new deaths in the region increased by 23%, bringing the cumulative number of deaths to over 84 000. The Islamic Republic of Iran, Morocco, Jordan, Iraq, and Lebanon reported the highest number of new cases in the last 7 days.

Iraq reported 23 389 new cases in the past week (581 new cases per 1 million population). The weekly number of new cases has remained over 23 000 since the week beginning [10 Aug 2020]. The number of deaths per week peaked in the week of [29 Jun 2020] and has gradually decreased to 373 per week (9.3 deaths per 1 million population) in the current reporting period.

Lebanon has recorded 11 869 new cases (1739 new cases per 1 million population) and 76 new deaths (11.1 new deaths per 1 million population) in the past week. There has been an upward trend of cases and deaths in the past 8 weeks in Lebanon.

In Tunisia, 8428 new cases were reported in the past week, which was just over a 10% decrease compared to the previous week. There were 500 new deaths reported in the past week, which was an 8% increase compared to the previous week. On [29 Oct 2020], Tunisian authorities stated that classes in elementary and middle schools will be suspended and premises disinfected.

Figure 5: Number of COVID-19 cases and deaths reported weekly by the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region, as of [8 Nov 2020].

- European Region
The number of new cases and deaths reported in the European Region continues to increase exponentially with 11% and 44% more cases and deaths respectively in the past week compared to the previous week, a record of weekly number of cases since the beginning of the epidemic. Moreover, test positivity rates have been steadily increasing since August [2020] and have shown a marked escalation in recent weeks.

This week, the region recorded 54% of all new cases and 47% of all new deaths reported globally bringing cumulative counts in the region to over 13 million cases and 311 000 deaths. Deaths have increased markedly in the past 7 days with France, Spain, and Italy reporting the highest counts of new deaths while Czechia, Belgium, and Slovenia reported the highest mortality rates per capita. Most of the Member States in the European Region self-characterise their current transmission pattern as either community transmission (55%, n=34) or clusters of cases (32%, n=20).

Over the past 3 weeks, Denmark has registered an increase in weekly incidence of COVID-19 cases reaching almost 1400 new cases per 1 million population (14% increase on the previous week). Since June 2020, 214 human cases of COVID-19 have been identified in Denmark with SARS-CoV-2 variants associated with farmed minks, including 12 cases with a unique variant, reported on [5 Nov 2020]. In the past few days, the Danish Prime Minister announced a planned cull of all mink in the country and imposed stricter public health and social measures in the area where the variants associated with farmed mink have been detected in humans.

This week, Spain became the country with the 6th highest number of COVID-19 cases globally, recording over 2000 new cases per 1 million population and bringing cumulative counts in the country to an excess of 1.3 million cases and almost 40 000 deaths. In the last weeks, the number of COVID-19 patients admitted to hospital has increased steadily and as of [6 Nov 2020], 6 of the 17 Autonomous Communities in Spain have reached over 40% intensive care unit (ICU) occupancy. Over the last week, a majority of outbreaks affecting 10 people or more in the country continue to be located in care homes for the elderly.

Figure 6: Number of COVID-19 cases and deaths reported weekly by the WHO European Region, as of [8 Nov 2020].

- South East Asia Region
The South East Asia Region had observed a continued declining trend in new cases and deaths over the past 6 weeks. However, in the past 7 days, almost 400 000 new cases (a weekly increase of 2%) and over 5000 deaths (a weekly increase of 10%) were reported in the region. The countries reporting the highest numbers of new cases in the South-East Asia region continue to be India, Indonesia, and Nepal, while the highest mortality rates were recorded in Nepal and Myanmar.

The only country in the region this week to report a substantial increase in new deaths has been Nepal. In the past week, Nepal reported its highest weekly increase in the number of new deaths with 5 deaths per 1 million population (58% increase compared to the previous week). Moreover, in the past 7 days, Nepal had the highest incidence of new cases per 1 million population (717 new cases per 1 million population) in the region. On [5 Nov 2020], Nepal reported over 400 cases in ICUs across the country. In the past week and for the 1st time in 7 months, the country reopened to those intending to climb or trek mountain trails.

While India is still reporting the highest number of new cases and deaths in the region, trends in these numbers for the country have stabilized in the past week. Even though the country has reached a total of over 9.5 million cases and almost 127 000 deaths cumulatively, in the past week, India recorded 230 new cases and 3 deaths per 1 million population. The most affected regions in the country are Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Andhra Pradesh while the regions with the highest number of active cases as of [8 Nov 2020] are Maharashtra, Kerala, and Delhi.

A stablisation in the incidence of cases and deaths has also been observed in Bangladesh in the past few weeks recording less than 70 new cases and less than 1 death per 1 million population in the past week (11 000 cases and 126 new deaths). In Cox's Bazar District, which hosts one of the world's largest refugee settlements, the incidence trends have remained relatively low since early July [2020] with a cumulative total of 5 255 COVID-19 cases reported as of [4 Nov 2020].

Figure 7: Number of COVID-19 cases and deaths reported weekly by the WHO South-East Asia Region, as of [8 Nov 2020].

- Western Pacific Region
The number of new cases reported in the last week in the Western Pacific (31 370) rose by the highest percentage globally, with a 19% increase compared to the previous week. Despite this increase, the number of new cases reported represents 1% of new cases reported globally last week. The number of new deaths was 5% lower than the previous week. The Philippines, Malaysia, Japan, and French Polynesia continue to report the highest numbers of new cases in the Region: the Philippines reported 13 232 new cases (121 new cases per million); Malaysia reported 7809 new cases (241 new cases per million); and Japan reported 5940 new cases (47 new cases per million).

The number of new cases in Japan peaked in the week of [3 Aug 2020] with over 10 000 cases. The number of new cases then dropped until the week of [21 Sep 2020] when just over 3000 cases were reported. However, it has since been rising, and there were 5940 new cases reported in the past week (a 29% increase from the previous week). Despite this increase last week, Japan reported 47 new cases per 1 million population, a relatively low number. Similarly, the number of new deaths in Japan remains very low and decreased by 16% compared with the previous week to 46 deaths, with only 0.4 deaths per million population.

COVID-19 cases started rising in French Polynesia from only a few cases at the beginning of August [2020] to 2733 new cases reported last week. The number of new cases rose by 95% from the previous week.

Cases in the Republic of Korea have gradually increased in October [2020], from around 500 new cases per week at the start of the month to 799 new cases reported in the week of 26 October. Last week the Republic of Korea reported 792 new cases which is a 1% decrease in comparison to the previous week.

[In the past 24 hours, the USA (137 228), India (44 679), and Italy (35 090), have been dominant. A global total of 10 064 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (9-10 Nov 2020). The global total is now above 51.8 million cases.

Countries reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours (15 countries) include the USA, India, Italy, Brazil (25 517), Poland (25 454), France (22 180), Russia (20 977), UK (20 412), Spain (17 395), Germany (16 668), Sweden (15 779), Czech Republic (12 699), Argentina (11 977), Iran (10 339), and Ukraine (10 179). A total of 55 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 22 of the 55 countries reporting more than 1000 newly confirmed cases are from the European region, 15 are from the Americas region, 12 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 4 are from the South East Asia region, 1 is from the African region, and 1 is from the Western Pacific region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have increased by 9.7%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 20.5%. Looking at the same comparisons in the USA (which reported 24.2% of all newly reported cases in the past 24 hours), as the dominant country worldwide with clearly uncontrolled transmission, the 7-day change in daily reported cases is 32.4% and in reported deaths is 9.2%.

Impression: The global daily reported cases continue to increase with the daily increase between 500 000 and 600 000 new cases. Countries in the European and the Americas regions are still showing the largest increases in daily new case counts, followed by the Eastern Mediterranean and the South East Asia regions. Italy may cross the 1 million mark for cumulative cases in the next 24-48 hours, bringing the number of countries reporting more than 1 million cases to 10.

All in all, the growth in the USA is exponential, having surpassed the 10 million cumulative case mark, with the state of Texas having reported over one million cases and California will be crossing one million cases in the next several days if daily reports continue at the same rate. - Mod.MPP]
