which was included in BSE update 2003 (11). These are not official
data. They are derived from the above-mentioned source, which seems
to be updated meticulously. The data from some countries may include
exceptional imported cases or exclude exported cases which were found
positive in the countries of destination. For additional information,

Most countries show decreased incidence of recorded BSE cases,
compared to 2002. The exceptions are Portugal, Spain (with a
relatively high number of cases), as well as Japan and Poland. -

British cows believed to be infection route for BSE
----------------------------------------------------
Meat-and-bone meal (MBM) made from cows imported from Britain in 1982
and 1987, when mad cow disease, or bovine spongiform encephalopathy
(BSE), swept through that country, and MBM imported from Italy before
1990 were likely to have been the route of infection for [Japan],
sources close to the Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Ministry
said Saturday.

According to the sources, the ministry's technical investigative
commission on BSE, which is trying to discover the infection route,
believes domestic cattle fed with the infected MBM became infected
and caused a second outbreak after they were themselves processed
into MBM. However, commission experts were still unable to identify a
specific infection route for the disease, the sources said. The
commission will compile a final report at a meeting Tuesday and
submit it to the ministry, the sources said.

7 infected cattle have so far been confirmed in the country, with the
first case discovered in Chiba Prefecture in September 2001. The
ministry began studying the infection route after the first case was
reported. An interim report was compiled in November 2001 and a 2nd
interim report was issued in March 2002. In November 2002, an
epidemiological research team of experts was established that used
previously gathered data to try to determine which of several
possible infection sources and routes could have been responsible.

Some of 14 cattle born in the 1980s, when BSE was ravaging Britain,
and imported in 1982 and 1987, were infected with the disease. Since
the cattle were processed into MBM in Japan, domestic cattle also
became infected. As a result, the team believed it was likely MBM
made from infected domestic cattle spread BSE domestically, the
sources said. Italian MBM has been suspected of being an infection
source because it was not properly heat-processed. The team
discovered that Italian MBM imported before 1990 contained an
abnormal prion, a protein believed to cause BSE, resulting in the
infection of domestic cattle, after examining the different periods
of Italian MBM importation.

However, the experts pointed out that human beings are unlikely to
contract BSE because they are protected by a "species barrier,"
meaning it is difficult for different species to infect one another.
In addition, since Japanese usually do not eat cow parts that carry
BSE, such as brains and spines, they are unlikely to contract BSE.

Since each cow is thoroughly examined, infected cattle are not likely
be sold or processed in the future, the sources said.

Canadian BSE proposals welcomed by international standards group: negotiator
--------------------------------------------------
Alarmed by the impact that one case of mad cow disease has had on
Canada's beef industry, other countries are embracing Canadian
proposals that would prevent such single cases from wreaking havoc
elsewhere.

Brian Evans, a Canadian representative at the Office Internationale
des Epizooties (OIE) meeting this week in Paris, said nobody wants to
go through what Canada has suffered over the past few months.
"Countries are definitely concerned," Evans said Tuesday. "If they
are next, they want to be treated differently than we've been
treated."

Evans is in the middle of a 5-day conference of the OIE, which sets
international standards on animal health for bodies such as the World
Trade Organization.

The Canadian delegation is pushing for changes to international
protocols for dealing with bovine spongiform encephalopathy, also
known as mad cow disease.

Discovery of one animal with the disease in May 2003 in northern
Alberta closed borders around the world to Canadian beef, costing the
industry more than 1 billion Canadian dollars.

Initial reaction to the Canadian proposals has been good, said Evans.
"It's been a very positive response," he said.

Source of mad cow may never be known
------------------------------------
Scientists may never know how an Alberta cow got BSE, but they've
narrowed it to 2 possible explanations.

Health Canada has determined that the animal infected with mad cow
disease didn't contract it from its parents. That means it either got
bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) from something it ate -- the
most common source -- or spontaneously. However, there isn't enough
left of the diseased cow's brain to be able to test whether it
occurred spontaneously.

The finding was released Thursday at a conference of international
experts on mad cow disease and related illnesses.

"One aspect of the explanation of the disease has been ruled out, and
what I think it tends to do is support the working assumption that it
was an infectious case," Dr. Michael Coulthart, head of the Health
Canada lab that tests for BSE, said.

Most cattle contract BSE when they eat the remains of another
infected cow. The remains of cattle were once used in cattle feed,
but that practice has been banned. Were scientists able to prove that
it was a spontaneous case, meaning little likelihood of other
infected animals, then international borders should open to Canadian
beef.

The province and Health Canada announced 20 May 2003 that a single
case of mad cow disease had been found, and while 2700 cattle were
slaughtered and tested for BSE, it remains the only case to date.

34 countries closed their borders to Canadian beef, costing the
industry an estimated 11 million Canadian dollars a day. The U.S.
and Mexico have since partially re-opened their borders, accepting
boneless cuts of meat from animals younger than 30 months.

The disease only appears in animals older than 2.5 years.

[Japan's conclusion (item 2) that meat-and-bone meal (MBM) made from
cows (how many?) imported from Britain in 1982 and 1987 might have
caused the cases in local cattle, is not unrelated to the Canadian
situation. About 160 live bovines were imported from UK to Canada
during the years 1982 to 1990, at least 45 of them in the critical
period 1988/89. For further details and their fate -- including
recycling -- see posting 20030529.1311. - Mod.AS]
