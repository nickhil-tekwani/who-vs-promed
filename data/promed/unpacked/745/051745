On Thursday [22 Nov 2012], the Director of Epidemiology of the Departmental Health Service (SEDES), Wilfredo Camargo, stated that there are suspected cases of hantavirus [infections] in the municipality of San Ramon, Itenez province [subdivision of a department] of the Amazonian Beni department [state equivalent].

Given this situation, health personnel are currently on alert and carrying out active supervision in order to determine if the suspected febrile syndrome cases in this populace are really [hantavirus infections]. "We found a patient diagnosed as [a] hantavirus [infection], which caught our attention since this area is not one positive for this disease, but transmitted by rodents," he stated. The physician said that they have done follow up on the patient who is from the El Vallecito cattle ranch.

He indicated that they have not found other cases in other ranches because the control was carried out only in San Ramon and not in the rural area.

At the same time, he stated that most recently, thanks to the sweep by [health] personnel sent to this populace, they have managed to control the epidemic of hemorrhagic fever that caused various deaths in the San Ramon municipality.

Work continues with surveillance, the active search for other suspected cases in ranches, clearings, settlements, and communities where the rodent _Calomys callosus_, the carrier of hemorrhagic fever, can be found.

Also, they delivered biosafety materials such as caps, masks, gloves, alcohol, rodenticide, and bed nets in the Magdalena locality where there are dengue cases.

[This report is confusing. It begins mentioning suspected hantavirus infections. Mention is made of a febrile syndrome, but nothing is stated about respiratory disease that would suggest hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS). Later in the report, it mentions hemorrhagic fever and the rodent _Calomys callosus_ , the reservoir of Machupo virus, the etiological agent of Bolivian hemorrhagic fever. However, _C. callosus_ is also the reservoir of Leguna Negra hantavirus in Bolivia that can cause HPS. Bermejo and Oran are southeastern Bolivian hantaviruses that can cause HPS, but their rodent reservoirs are _Oligoryzomys chacoensis_ and _O. longicaudatus_, respectively, and are found in thorn scrub, chaco dry forest, and dry grasslands, not Amazonian forest. Rio Mamore hantavirus, with _O. microtis_ as its rodent reservoir, occurs in the Amazon forests but is not associated with human disease.

A laboratory confirmed hantavirus infection was diagnosed in 2011 in a child in San Andres municipality, Beni department. However, the specific hantavirus involved was not stated (see ProMED-mail archive no 20110703.2020). ProMED-mail requests clarification concerning the etiological agent of this case as well as any others, and determination of whether these are hantavirus (and which one) or Machupo virus infections, or something else entirely. - Mod.TY
