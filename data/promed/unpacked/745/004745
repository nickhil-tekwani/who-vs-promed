Meeting discusses steps for prevention of leishmaniasis
-----------------------
At Chandka Medical College (CMC), Larkana, Prof Sikandar Ali Shaikh chaired
a meeting on Thursday to review measures to stop the spread of
leishmaniasis in Larkana and Dadu districts. The meeting was held on the
directives of Sindh health secretary, as the outbreak of leishmaniasis has
reportedly affected hundreds of people in both the districts. CMC Hospital
Medical Superintendent Dr Syed Mehboob Shah assured the meeting of his
all-out support for containing leishmaniasis. He said that the hospital
administration had already initiated measures in this regard.
Larkana District Health Officer Dr Khalil Ahmed Katpar told the meeting
that the disease was on the rise in Larkana city and pointed out the
unavailability of sodium [stibogluconate] injections, which is used in
treatment of leishmaniasis. He said that more than 400 cases of
leishmaniasis were reported in the Larkana district.
The meeting called for a spray in the affected areas to kill sand flies,
which [spread] leishmaniasis. The meeting was attended among others by Head
of the Department of Community Medicine of CMC Larkana Dr Abrar Ahmed
Shaikh, Senior Registrar of the Dermatology Department Dr Muzaffar Ali
Shaikh, Dr Farooqur Rehman Soomro, Dr Aijaz Hussain Solangi, and Dr Abdul
Ghaffar Shaikh.

[ProMED has commented thoroughly on the prospects of controlling
leishmaniasis through spraying campaigns [see ProMED posting
20050113.0115], and there seem to be conflicting views of the most
appropriate control measures between the Pakistani authorities and the WHO
[see ProMED posting 20040126.0309]. It now seems that the authorities have
decided to launch a spraying campaign, and we hope they refer to indoor
residual house spraying and not aerial spraying, which has never been
proved to be effective in preventing transmission of leishmaniasis. But
indoor residual house-spraying will only work if the phlebotomine sandfly
vectors rest in houses alone.- Mods.EP/MS]
