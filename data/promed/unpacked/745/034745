"Our results show that colonization of swine by MRSA
[methicillin-resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_] was very common in one
of 2 corporate swine production systems we studied," said Tara Smith,
PhD, associate professor of epidemiology in the University of Iowa
College of Public Health and lead author of the study. "Because ST398
was found in both animals and humans, it suggests transmission between
the 2. Our findings also suggest that once MRSA is introduced, it may
spread broadly among both swine and their caretakers. Agricultural
animals could become an important reservoir for this bacterium," Smith
added.

_Staphylococcus aureus_, often called "staph," are bacteria commonly
carried on the skin or in the nose of healthy people. MRSA is a type
of staph that is resistant to the broad-spectrum antibiotics commonly
used to treat it. A recent study estimated that MRSA caused 94 000
infections and more than 18 000 deaths in the United States in 2005.

MRSA has been found in a variety of animals, including horses, cattle,
dogs, cats, and swine. Previous studies have shown that many swine and
swine farmers in Canada and the Netherlands are colonized with MRSA.
However, the University of Iowa study was the first to investigate
carriage of MRSA among swine and swine farmers in the United States.

For the study, investigators analyzed nasal swabs of 299 swine and 20
swine workers from 2 different production systems in Iowa and
Illinois. At Production System A, the overall prevalence of MRSA was
70 percent in swine and 64 percent in workers. At Production System B,
all swine and human samples were negative for MRSA.

The researchers could not determine why System A had a high prevalence
rate of MRSA among its swine and swine handlers, but listed several
differences compared to System B. First, the systems raised different
breeds of swine. Second, System A was an older, more established
operation that had approximately twice the number of animals as System
B. Third, both systems imported sows from different sources, raising
the possibility that ST398 may have been introduced via live swine or
pork products.

Other research has shown that ST398 accounts for 20 percent of all
MRSA detected in the Netherlands, demonstrating the importance of
considering livestock and other animals when examining the
epidemiology of MRSA. "Iowa ranks 1st in the nation in swine
production," Smith said. "Transmission of MRSA on swine farms or in
veterinary facilities could complicate efforts to reduce MRSA
transmission statewide and beyond."

The investigators recommended that future studies assess the risk of
MRSA disease among swine workers and their contacts, survey retail
meat products for MRSA contamination, study larger populations of
swine and humans to define the epidemiology of MRSA within swine
operations, and assess MRSA carriage rates in other livestock.

[Terry Singeltary <flounder9@verizon.net> is thanked for originally
bringing to ProMED-mail's attention the journal article that prompted
this news release: Smith TC, Male MJ, Harper AL, et al:
Methicillin-Resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_ (MRSA) Strain ST398 Is
Present in Midwestern U.S. Swine and Swine Workers. PLoS ONE 4(1):
e4258. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0004258, available at
<http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004258>.

In this study, MRSA isolates were not typeable by pulsed field gel
electro-phoresis (PFGE) using Sma-1, but digestion with EagI revealed
that the isolates were clonal. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST)
documented that the isolates were ST398. The isolates were, however,
not related to common human types in Iowa (USA100, USA300, and
USA400). The investigators suggest that additional studies in larger
populations will be needed to identify risk factors among the swine
workers for acquisition of MRSA ST398.

This is not the 1st time that MRSA ST 398 was found in livestock and
livestock workers in North America. Colonization with MRSA ST398 has
recently been reported in pigs and pig farmers in Ontario, Canada (see
ProMED-mail posting 20071109.3640). The investigators of the recent
study in the United States point out that "a portion of the sows at
PSA [production site A, where ST398 was found], were imported from
Canada, while those from PSB [production site B, where ST398 was not
found], originated in Michigan. Canada is the most important exporter
of live hogs to the US. Thus, it is possible that ST398 may have been
brought into the US via live swine or pork products."

[From Mod.ML's comments in a prior ProMED-mail post archive number
20080605.1799:

"Non-typeable (NT)-MRSA by pulse field gel electrophoresis (PFGE)
using Sma-1 and belonging to multilocus sequence type (MLST) ST 398
initially was detected in the Netherlands in pigs and pig farmers in
2003. This strain of presumably animal origin (nearly 40 percent of
pigs in the Netherlands have been found to be colonized by this
strain) is now reported to be responsible for more than 20 percent of
all MRSA infections in the Netherlands
(<http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/568512> -- subscription
required), and has been found in community-associated human infections
in several European countries, North America, and Asia. Nosocomial
transmission of this strain has also been reported recently among
patients and health care workers in the Netherlands
<http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/eccmid18/abstract.asp?id=69352>."
