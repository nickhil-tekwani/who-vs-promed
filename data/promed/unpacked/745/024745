Re: Botulism, canned tomatoes - Russia: background information
--------------------------------------------------------------
Although botulism is commonly associated with canned foods and
vegetables, tomatoes are rarely implicated. A single botulism
outbreak among 116 listed in the Gideon database
(<http://www.GideonOnline.com>) is ascribed to tomatoes. In fact,
only 3 papers could be identified through a PubMed search using the
terms "tomatoes" and "botulism" (1-3). Interestingly, 2 of these
papers originated in Russia, the country that reported the most
recent outbreak in ProMED-mail.

One explanation for the relative rarity of botulism in tomatoes is
related to the acidity of this vegetable. A lowered pH is thought to
act through 2 mechanisms: enhanced susceptibility of _Clostridium
botulinum_ spores to heat sterilization, and inhibition of
germination of surviving spores (4).
