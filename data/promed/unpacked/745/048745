Deadly tick-borne disease turns up in Wyoming
------------------------
This month 2 cases of a potentially deadly tick-borne disease were reported
in Wyoming. Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever was found in Fremont and Campbell
counties, about a month before the season generally begins. The disease is
fairly rare in Wyoming, with an average of 2 cases each year.
"It's a bit unusual," said Scott Seys, an epiemiologist with the Wyoming
Department of Health, "but of course with such small numbers, it's hard to
say." The disease is most often seen in the summer, he said. Untreated, it
can be serious.
Symptoms include a moderate to high fever, muscle aches and pains, and
chills [in addition, a severe headache occurs -- often the worst ever
experienced by the patient -- characteristic of most rickettsial
infections - Mod.LL]. Also, in 85 to 90 percent of cases, a rash appears on
the arms or legs and eventually spreads to the palms and soles of the feet.
"That makes it distinctive from other rashes," Seys said. "If the rash is on
the trunk, it's probably not spotted fever." [The characteristic rash occurs
on the third day of fever and headache, beginning as a maculopapular
eruption on the wrists and ankles and spreading distally to the palms and
soles and somewhat proximally, as well as becoming petechial or purpuric. -
Mod.LL]
A tick must be attached to the body and feeding for at least 4 hours for the
disease to infect a person, he said. "If a tick is crawling on them, they
won't catch it." Seys suggests hikers tuck pant legs into their socks to
reduce the chances of exposure to a tick and to do a thorough body check for
ticks after walking in tall-grass areas.

[RMSF was originally characterized in the Bitter Root valley of Montana in
the early part of the 20th century by Howard Ricketts and others. He was
able to transmit the disease to guinea pigs and monkeys via the blood of
affected patients and by the wood tick, _Dermacentor andersoni_. The
organisms causing the infection, rickettsiae, were subsequently named after
Ricketts, who died of another rickettsial disease, typhus. All the
manifestations of RMSF can be explained by the primary lesion of the
disease, an endovasculitis.
Although originally described in the mountainous west of the USA, the
infection is more commonly found in the eastern mid-Atlantic states, where
the vector is _D. variabilis_, the dog tick. Cases, however, have been
described in most states throughout the USA and even in the New York City
metropolitan area (1,2). As stated above, the feeding tick will not
transmit RMSF to the host for at least 4 hours (3) in part because it is
necessary that the blood meal activate the rickettsiae, migrating to the
salivary glands of the tick. It is likely that transmission occurs
primarily after 12-24 hours of painless feeding of the engorging tick.
Wyoming has not had much RMSF reported in recent years and the diagnosis of
2 cases so early in the 'tick season' requires attention. However, in
Harrell's classic paper from 1949 (3), in the period between 1939 and 1947,
Wyoming reported over 300 cases.
