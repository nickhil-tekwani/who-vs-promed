Afghanistan: polio risk from 2 directions
-----------------------------------------
Hopes for a polio-free northern Afghanistan have been dashed after a
case was reported in the northern Kunduz Province in August [2010],
almost a decade since the last one. The crippling virus has been
eliminated in most parts of the landlocked country, except in the
insecure south and eastern provinces.

A total of 18 polio cases have been confirmed this year [2010]: 15 in
the southern Kandahar, Helmand, Farah, and Urozgan provinces; 2 in
eastern Nangarhar Province; and now a 13-month-old boy in Kunduz.
Initially, health officials assumed the virus could have migrated from
neighbouring Tajikistan where more than 450 polio cases have been
reported this year [2010]. However, laboratory tests pointed to
another direction. "The virus is closely linked with the current
circulation in the FATA [Federally Administered Tribal Areas] of
Pakistan, a probable indication of importation from there," Arshad
Quddus, an official of the UN World Health Organization (WHO), told
IRIN. The Kunduz boy has been permanently paralyzed, officials said.
It is now believed he was infected in Pakistan from where his family
returned to Kunduz Province earlier this year. At least 69 polio cases
have been reported in Pakistan from January to September 2010.
Millions of Afghan refugees live in Pakistan and tens of thousands of
people move across the 2400 km [approx. 1500 mi] porous border every
day.

Also a major outbreak of wild poliovirus has been reported in
Tajikistan, which has spilled over to Turkmenistan and Russia,
according to UN agencies. "We are gravely concerned about the spread
of poliovirus from Tajikistan to Afghanistan," Suraya Dalil, the
acting health minister of Afghanistan, said during the launch of a
3-day nationwide polio immunization campaign on Sun 3 Oct 2010. The
campaign, funded by UN agencies and other donors, targeted 7.8 million
children in all 34 provinces. The situation in Tajikistan as well as
the reported polio case in Kunduz Province have resulted in enhanced
border surveillance and immunization, officials said. "We vaccinate
every person -- children and adults -- who crosses the
Afghanistan-Tajikistan border," Nabi Azeem, Kunduz health director,
told IRIN, adding that health posts had been established at several
border points. The type 1 poliovirus in Tajikistan is linked to a
strain also seen in India's Uttar Pradesh Province, health officials
said.

In Afghanistan, types 1 and 3 have been in circulation for which
bivalent oral polio vaccines have been used since December 2009.
Afghanistan has been struggling to wipe out polio with several rounds
of immunization every year. War, lack of access to every child, and
low awareness among families are the major obstacles towards
eradication, experts say.

Angola polio outbreak threatens neighbours: WHO
-----------------------------------------------
A persistent outbreak of polio in Angola is now a matter of
international concern and health authorities there must step up their
efforts to stamp it out, the World Health Organisation (WHO) said on
Friday [1 Oct 2010]. The WHO's spokeswoman on polio eradication, Sona
Bari, said an outbreak of the crippling virus, which started in 2007
after Angola had been polio-free for 6 years, now has "international
consequences" if it is not stopped. So far this year [2010] Angola has
had 24 cases of polio -- a virus which attacks the nervous system and
can cause irreversible paralysis -- adding to 29 in 2009 and 29 in
2008, she said. "It is the only expanding outbreak in all of Africa,
spreading both within Angola and into the Democratic Republic of
Congo," Bari said in a telephone interview. "It's a high threat to
neighbouring countries." The Democratic Republic of Congo has had 15
polio cases so far this year [2010] after having just 3 in the whole
of 2009.
