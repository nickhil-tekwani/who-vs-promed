Police investigating the deaths of birds and prey in Ross-shire and the Black Isle have said another 2 dead red kites have been found. This brings the total of dead raptors discovered since March 2014 to 22 -- 16 red kites and 6 buzzards. Tests have so far confirmed that 12 of the birds were poisoned.

A reward for information leading to a prosecution has been added to by donations from RSPB Scotland [Royal Society for the Protection of Birds] , landowners, farmers and the public.

[The issue of this many birds of prey or carrion being found dead indeed smacks of a toxin. However, multiple articles all say the birds were poisoned and they are investigating. Their investigation has included DNA testing of meat to determine what type of meat was used. These investigators say they need to get insecticide tests performed, yet not a single article mentioned if that has been done or what the outcome was, or if the test was pending.

While this number of birds being found dead is of concern, and the number of avian deaths seems to be climbing, the lack of testing, and/or the lack of accurate reporting remains of equal or greater concern.
