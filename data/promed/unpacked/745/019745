MEASLES - BOLIVIA: ALERT, ADULT VACCINATION *NOT*
REQUIRED

From: John Cathey <jtcathey@mail.mcn.org>

I was in Bolivia this past week, at Copacabana on Lake Titicaca.
Despite the information that travelers under 30 are required to get
vaccinations, there was nothing about it at the border [with Peru]
and several people in the group I was with were under 30.
I found an English newspaper report that the "epidemic" has been
in progress since May 1998, but has apparently increased
considerably recently. The Bolivians are vaccinating children.
There have been some deaths but very few.
