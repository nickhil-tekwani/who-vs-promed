The Brucellosis Survey is being carried out by FAO (Food and Agriculture
Organization in U.N.)-Tajikistan for 2 months, Apr-May 2003, with funding
from Sweden and Norway is a follow-up action of the recent workshop jointly
organized by FAO and MoA on brucellosis in Dushanbe, where the Public Health
Department of the MoH reported a sharp increase in the annual number of human
brucellosis cases.

Confirmed human brucellosis has been reported in some districts as high as
371 new cases per 100 000 persons (Tavildara in RRS). Pending confirmation of
funding, a brucellosis control programme in high risk districts will be
initiated in 2003 by FAO in Tajikistan and monitored by the Government
veterinary and public health units in order to reduce the disease incidence
in animals and humans.

An epidemiologically sound and agreed control programme is needed if the
incidence of brucellosis in animals and humans is to be effectively reduced.
Not all districts can be covered; therefore the number of districts addressed
in such a programme must be determined by known brucellosis prevalence.

Determining which districts are at highest risk is therefore the objective of
the current Brucellosis Survey. The programme will be implemented at low cost
utilising government veterinarians who are supported under contract by FAO,
and by fostering collaboration between the human and animal health units of
Government and the international organizations.
