The death toll from a strange disease that originated from Liberia's south eastern county of Sinoe has risen to 13, following 2 more deaths in the country's capital Monrovia, authorities have said. The 2 victims had contact with their deceased relatives in Sinoe county before moving to Monrovia, health ministry spokesman Sorbor George said on [Mon 1 May 2017].

So far, 21 people have been known to contract the disease, which laboratory tests has proved to be neither Ebola nor Lassa fever. Local sources said all the dead victims suffered severe stomach pain before death. Most of the deaths occurred in the Sinoe county capital of Greenville.

An investigation is under way to ascertain the origin of the disease in Greenville. The health ministry said it has launched a massive search for all the 60 people who attended a funeral in Greenville to place them in isolation. It is suspected that the disease originated from that funeral.

The Liberian government has already put in place the necessary mechanisms and measures to contain any outbreak of infectious diseases in the country, a local official said.

About 4500 people died in Liberia alone in 2014 when the Ebola outbreak ravaged countries in west Africa.
