Health authorities are planning to launch a mass vaccination drive against typhoid fever in Karachi after 2 children died due to extensively drug-resistant (XDR) typhoid in the Sheedi goth area of Malir district in Karachi this week, health officials said on Tue 25 Jun 2019, adding as many as 122 cases of typhoid fever were reported from the area since [Tue 18 Jun 2019].

"Two young girls including a 12-year-old and a 9-year-old died due to typhoid in the Sheedi goth (village) of Malir district last week. Both the children had typhoid and died during treatment. The entire village is in the grip of typhoid, and so far, we have taken samples of 122 people, mostly children, for analysis," Dr. Ahmed Ali Memon, district health officer (DHO) Malir, said while talking to The News on Tue 25 Jun 2019.

Several areas of Sindh are in the grip of the extensively drug-resistant (XDR) typhoid including Karachi, which authorities say is rapidly getting out of control due to poor sanitary conditions, contaminated drinking water, and lack of proper treatment facilities. According to unofficial figures, several dozen deaths were reported from different parts of the province from the superbug that is resistant to the most known antimicrobials.

According to WHO, the bacterium _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Typhi causes typhoid fever, which is a life-threatening and a highly infectious illness that spreads with poor sanitation. The circulating strain of XDR _S._ Typhi in Pakistan is resistant to 5 classes of antibacterials and is thereby named as extensively drug-resistant (XDR) typhoid.

The WHO's infection prevention control (IPC) experts have declared antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and XDR typhoid as the most serious healthcare challenge for Pakistan, as compared to HIV and hepatitis B and C epidemics in the province, saying the antimicrobial resistance could play havoc with the lives of people in Pakistan if not managed at the earliest.

DHO Malir said the outbreak in Sheedi village of Malir was 1st reported to them on [Tue 18 Jun 2019], when a young girl died due to typhoid fever and over 30 people, mostly children, reported high-grade fever. The next day [Wed 19 Jun 2019], another child from the same area died at National Institute of Child Health, and doctors confirmed his death as a result of the lethal waterborne disease.

"We immediately sent an epidemiological team to the area, which examined the living conditions, took samples of water, and also sent the blood samples of the sick children and patients for analysis. Initial reports suggest an outbreak of typhoid is the cause of 2 deaths and sickness of over 150 people in the area," Dr. Ahmed Ali Memon said. He said the experts of the Field Epidemiology and Laboratory Training Programme (FELTP) also examined a water tank from where villagers used to get water for drinking, and they were shocked to learn that sewage-[contaminated] water was being consumed.

Confirming the deaths, director general health Sindh Dr. Masood Solangi said the health department's teams are responding to the outbreak of typhoid. He also confirmed that of the 51 typhoid cases, 5 were confirmed as XDR typhoid cases, while results of several other cases were awaited. He added that in order to contain the epidemic, they have decided to immediately start a vaccination drive in the area.

"All the suspected cases tested positive for IgM antibodies on rapid diagnostic testing. Moreover, 5 (10%) of the 51 suspected cases tested positive for being extensively drug-resistant strains on blood culture (resistant to ceftriaxone), and the [remaining] 46 (90%) are awaiting their culture results," Dr. Masood Solangi informed. Sharing the data of typhoid and XDR typhoid cases in the province since November 2016 until 5 May 2019, Dr. Solangi added that a whopping 10 677 people were tested positive for typhoid in the province, of which 7109 were infected with XDR typhoid.

"Of these, 7947 cases of typhoid were reported from different areas of Karachi, of which 4973 were XDR typhoid," Dr. Masood Solangi said, adding that, however, they "do not have any actual data of deaths due to XDR typhoid in Sindh."

To a query, DG Health Sindh said a meeting of all the stakeholders including international health agencies representatives in Pakistan and health department officials is being held today (Wed 26 Jun 2019) to immediately launch a vaccination drive in whole of Karachi.

[The following is extracted from a former CDC notice regarding this multiple-resistant typhoid strain in Pakistan:

"The XDR strain of _Salmonella_ Typhi is resistant to most antibiotics (ampicillin, chloramphenicol, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, ciprofloxacin, and ceftriaxone) used to treat typhoid fever. Healthcare providers should
- Obtain a complete travel history (asking about travel to South Asia, including Pakistan) from patients with suspected typhoid fever;
- Collect stool and blood cultures from patients with suspected typhoid fever and request antimicrobial susceptibility testing on isolates;
- Be aware that the Pakistan outbreak strain remains susceptible to azithromycin and carbapenems. Azithromycin is effective for uncomplicated (diarrhea or bacteremia without secondary complications) typhoid fever and should be used to treat patients with suspected uncomplicated typhoid fever who have traveled to Pakistan. When culture and sensitivity results are available, adjust treatment accordingly. Adult azithromycin dosage is usually 1000 mg orally once, then 500 mg orally daily, or 1000 mg orally once daily for at least 5-7 days. Pediatric azithromycin dose is 20 mg/kg orally once, then 10-20 mg/kg orally once per day (maximum 1000 mg per day) for at least 5-7 days;
- Carbapenems should be used for patients with suspected severe or complicated typhoid fever who have traveled to Pakistan. Severe or complicated typhoid fever would include, but not be limited to, patients with gastrointestinal complications (such as typhoid-related intestinal perforation, peritonitis, intestinal hemorrhage, hepatitis), neurologic complications (such as typhoid encephalopathy, including altered consciousness, delirium, confusion), or bacteremia with sepsis or shock. When culture and sensitivity results are available, adjust treatment accordingly. Consider getting an infectious diseases consultation for these patients;
- Be aware that relapses can occur, often 1-3 weeks after clinical improvement;
- Be aware that most (90%) _S._ Typhi isolates from patients coming from South Asia have decreased susceptibility or resistance to fluoroquinolones, including ciprofloxacin; therefore, fluoroquinolones should not be used as empiric treatment for suspected typhoid fever in patients who have traveled to this area; and
- Report all cases of confirmed typhoid fever to the appropriate local or state health departments."
