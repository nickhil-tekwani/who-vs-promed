In response to Robert LaBudde: When discussing _Salmonella_ in eggs it is
important
to distinguish that it is the serovar enteritidis which may be found in
eggs. We're not talking about all non-typhoid _Salmonella_.
One in 20,000 eggs is an ESTIMATE! 25% of contaminated eggs causing illness
is a PROJECTION! It is a BELIEF that 80% of _S. enterica_ SEROVAR
ENTERITIDIS cases in humans are related to eggs.
Even if one subscribes to FDA-USDA numbers, one cannot conclude that other
sources pale in comparison to eggs!
With regard to phage type 4 in California, this phage type was considered
exotic in the U.S. poultry industry prior to its detection in the chicken
flock near the contaminated sewage effluent. Finding it in humans before
its detection in poultry could very well be circumstantial evidence for
human to chicken transmission. Humans may very well be a reservoir for
transmission of _Salmonella enterica_ to chickens even if they are not a
reservoir for human to human transmission.

I noticed your posting on ProMED-mail re: the new USDA shell egg risk
assessment study. I try to follow the issue because I've done several
reports for Dateline NBC concerning the problem of _Salmonella enteritidis_
in shell eggs.
You might want to double-check one statistic you cite. You say the new
report indicates 80% of "all _Salmonella_ cases" in the US are caused by
shell eggs.
As I recall, the CDC studies estimate 80% of the "_Salmonella enteritidis_"
cases are linked to eggs -- not 80% of _Salmonella_ cases overall. I
believe _Salmonella enteritidis_ represents roughly one-quarter of the
total _Salmonella_ cases identified
in the U.S.

Thank you for catching my misstatement.
