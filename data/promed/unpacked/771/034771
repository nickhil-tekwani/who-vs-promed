PEI [Prince Edward Island] has seen an increase in the number of cases of infectious syphilis, says Chief Public Health Officer Dr Heather Morrison. [Prince Edward Island is a Canadian province consisting of the main island itself, as well as other islands. It is one of the 3 Maritime Provinces and is the smallest province in both land area and population (140 204 residents in 2011). - Mod.ML]

So far in 2014, the number of infectious syphilis cases is twice that of the number in 2013. "We're worried about this," said Morrison in an interview with CBC News.

Syphilis is not common on the Island. There were no cases at all from 2000-06. In 2010-11, there were a total of 12 cases. However, within the last few weeks, 15 to 20 infectious cases have been investigated by public health authorities.

Traditionally, syphilis cases on the Island came from when residents travelled off the Island. That isn't the case at the moment. "The transmission is occurring on the Island," said Morrison.

Syphilis is primarily a sexually-transmitted infection caused by a bacterium. Symptoms of infection may include a painless ulcer or chancre, rash, fever, swollen or enlarged lymph nodes, hair loss, headaches, inflammation of the eye, generally feeling unwell, and infection in the brain. If left untreated, syphilis can cause heart and brain complications, including dementia.

Morrison said anyone who may be at risk and is exhibiting symptoms should abstain from unprotected sex and seek medical care. Syphilis can be treated with antibiotics, and follow-up testing is very important to ensure that treatment has been successful. For people who are sexually active, the best protection against syphilis is condoms.

[The increase in the occurrence of syphilis in the Canadian province of Prince Edward Island may be due to enhanced case detection, for example, by the institution of routine syphilis screening in high-risk groups, or to a true increased incidence of syphilis. The news report above gives no information concerning this point.

The incidence rates of early syphilis in Canada, as in the United States, have been increasing since about 2000. In Canada, the male-to-female rate ratio increased from 1.5:1.0 in 1999 to 6.4:1.0 in 2008, reflecting that more males than females were reported with early syphilis, and this disparity increased over time (http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/std-mts/report/sti-its2008/05-eng.php). In 2008, men accounted for 86.1 percent of reported cases. Between 1999 and 2008, the rate in men increased from 0.7 to 7.3 per 100 000 and in women increased from 0.5 to 1.1 per 100 000. In men, the highest reported rate of early syphilis was shared between 25-29 year olds and 30-39 year olds (13.3 per 100 000) (http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/std-mts/report/sti-its2008/05-eng.php). Together, these age groups accounted for almost 40 percent of reported cases in men in 2008. In women, the highest reported rate was in 20-24 year olds (3.6 per 100 000). In males, the greatest increase in reported rates of early syphilis between 1999 and 2008 was in 25-29 year olds.

In many countries, the increased incidence of syphilis is occurring mainly among men who have sex with men (MSM), and has been characterized by high rates of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) co-infection, high-risk sexual behavior, use of drugs such as methamphetamines, use of Internet chat rooms to meet sex partners (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5510a1.htm), and more recently, use of smartphone applications like Grindr, a gay social networking site. A discussion of the risk for acquisition of sexually transmitted diseases associated with use of the Internet, mobile phones and social networking sites can be found at http://www.cdc.gov/std/life-stages-populations/Adolescents-white-paper.pdf.

A recent article posted by ProMED-mail reported that HIV-infected MSM seek out other HIV-positive sex partners to avoid using condoms, which, of course, would allow transmission of syphilis, gonorrhea, and other sexually transmitted diseases among HIV-infected MSM (ProMED-mail post Syphilis & gonococcal dis. - USA (04): (OR) rising incidence, MSM, HIV coinfect. 20140608.2527642).

However, the news report above fails to characterize the cases of syphilis in Prince Edward Island, as to age, sex, sex behavior, HIV infection status, or use of drugs, social networking Internet sites, and smartphone apps. Such information is essential so that we can effectively target efforts to limit potential spread. A more detailed description of the cases would be appreciated. - Mod.ML
