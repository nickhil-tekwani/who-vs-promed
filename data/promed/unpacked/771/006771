I agree with Dr. da Silva that care must be taken in the interpretation of
leptospiral serology, particularly in regions where leptospirosis is
endemic. However, I do not agree that the historical evidence supports the
assertion that outbreaks associated with flooding are caused by a single
serovar, that rats are the carrier, and that the high case-fatality rate
indicates that serovar _icterohaemorrhagiae_ is involved.
Recent experience with the outbreak of leptospirosis in Nicaragua serves to
illustrate these points. Multiple serovars were isolated from patients
during the outbreak in Nicaragua, which was also associated with flooding.
There is good evidence that dogs were epidemiologically important in that
outbreak. Infection with many serovars of Leptospira can and do produce
serious disease in humans and it is not accurate to try and identify the
serovar based on the case-fatality rate or the clinical signs in persons
with the disease.
Flooding serves to enhance the likelihood of transmission of leptospirosis
from animals to man in at least two ways: 1) widespread flooding often
brings the maintenance host for the organism in closer contact with humans;
and 2) the flood waters serve to disseminate the infectious urine of
maintenance host animals resulting in the exposure of many more persons to
the pathogen.
Leptospirosis is a disease of protean manifestations and complicated
epidemiological relationships. Public health officials and veterinarians
need to be careful when making "rules" about leptospirosis. Careful analysis
of serologic results in combination with isolation of the organism from
affected persons, and the animals with which they share their environment,
is the only way to definitively identify the cause(s) of any particular
outbreak of leptospirosis. All other information must be considered
speculative.

[After years of chasing this organism in the field, I can only re-emphasise
Carole's comment about the importance of isolating the organism in order to
have a definitive identification of the serovar(s). Whilst not forgetting
the importance of human deaths from leptospirosis, excess rainfall and
flooding will put livestock and domestic animals at risk of this disease and
probably result in serious additional economic losses, whether or no there
are human deaths. - Mod.MHJ
