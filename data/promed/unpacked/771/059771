Rush on to beat grape rot
--------------------------
Winegrowers are rushing to harvest the region's premium grapes before
they perish on the vine. Heavy rain over the past 3 days has spelt an
abrupt end to what was shaping up to be a dream harvest. A grower
said if he did not finish harvesting one of his blocks by this
Thursday [10 Apr 2008] he stood to lose 80 tonnes and the equivalent
of NZD 200 000 (USD 159 000). Another grower and consultant said
those who managed to harvest crops before last weekend [5-6 Apr 2008]
would be breathing sighs of relief, while those who had not would be
concerned. He said there was evidence of disease such as botrytis and
sour rot in crops. However, the industry was managing the problem of
disease risk as best it could harvesting the crop quickly.

According to HortResearch rainfall figures, 7.8mm of rain fell on
Saturday [5 Apr 2008] and a further 7mm yesterday [7 Apr 2008].
Marlborough Wine Research Centre science leader Mike Trought said
more than 50 percent of the local crops had been harvested. Rain is
producing botrytis, a fungus that attacks grape skins, in
Marlborough's bumper crop this year [2008]. Botrytis causes a
concentration as the grape naturally dehydrates. Rain can also cause
diseases such as vine rot and slip skin, all of which can be
detrimental to a crop. "I have looked at a number of blocks and there
is botrytis out there," Dr Trought said. He said managers would have
had their eye on the weather conditions and be making decisions based
on this. He said he would be surprised if he found a winery that was
not getting their crop in quickly.

[Bunch rot caused by the fungus _Botrytis cinerea_ has been reported
wherever grapes are grown. The disease can cause serious losses in
both yield and fruit quality. The fungus infects shoots, flowers,
leaves, and fruit. If blossoms are infected, the fungus remains
latent until berries begin to soften. Infection is optimal at 15-20
deg C (59-68 deg F) with free water or over 90 percent humidity.
Grape cultivars with dense canopies, thin skins, and/or tight
clusters are more susceptible. The rot may progress to infect whole
clusters, and girdling lesions on the pedicel or rachis may lead to
drying and premature cluster drop. Affected berries may split open,
develop a greyish mold on the surface, and may shrivel in dry
conditions. The pathogen overwinters on plant material and is spread
by water, wind, mechanical means, and juice from split berries.
Mechanical damage caused by birds or insects creates entry points for
the fungus and can greatly increase losses. Disease management relies
mainly on fungicide applications and cultural practices. _B. cinerea_
also causes blights and grey molds on a range of other crops, for
example onion, peanut, mango, and tomato.

Other fungal species may also be associated with bunch rots of
grapevine, and predominance of pathogens often depends on climatic
conditions. Other microorganisms such as yeasts and bacteria,
especially _Acetobacter_ spp., also commonly contribute to bunch rot.
The name sour rot is often applied to bunch rots involving
_Acetobacter_ due to the characteristic vinegar smell produced by the
bacteria. Bunch rots initially caused by fungi can culminate in sour
rot. Crop damage can be extensive because infections that begin in a
single berry can rapidly spread to adjacent berries and destroy most
or all of a cluster.

Vine rots and 'slip skin' effects (easy separation of skin and berry
flesh) may be due to fungal infections, but it is not clear what
specific pathogens are implicated in the report above.
