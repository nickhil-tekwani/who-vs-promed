Update on actions taken following the isolation of MEF-1 reference
poliovirus associated with acute flaccid paralysis cases in India in late
2002 and early 2003
--------------------------------------------------
The isolation of a wild poliovirus type 2 reference strain (MEF-1)
from stool specimens collected from 7 acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) cases
in India was reported on 21 Mar 2003 [see: WER See No. 12, 2003, p. 88].
The cases, from western Uttar Pradesh (6) and Gujarat (1), had onset of
paralysis between 10 Nov 2002 and 4 Feb 2003. An intensive investigation
led by the Government of India and WHO was initiated in response.
The extensive epidemiological and virological investigation included
detailed investigations of the 7 cases, re-testing of all original
specimens, genetic sequencing of all isolates, and a detailed review of AFP
surveillance and laboratory records and laboratory test results. Laboratory
analysis of genetic data on the MEF-1 viruses confirmed the epidemiological
conclusion that there was no circulation in the community. AFP and
laboratory surveillance was maintained throughout.
No further cases associated with MEF-1 were found after the 4 Feb 2003
case. Evidence from the investigation pointed to a limited number of single
introductions of MEF-1 over a 1- to 2-month period in late 2002 and
possibly early 2003. Based on the preliminary findings, a detailed search
for potential sources of the MEF-1 was carried out, including diagnostic
and research laboratories and vaccine production facilities. Because of the
possible temporal association of the onset of AFP with mass immunization
activities, field samples of oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) used in
the affected districts were collected for testing as part of the
investigation. During the week of 20 Jul 2003, 2 laboratories independently
found a number of vaccine vials tested positive for MEF-1. All of the vials
that tested positive were from a single batch of vaccine.
While current epidemiological and laboratory evidence suggests that the
introduction of MEF-1 was an isolated episode that occurred in
2002, exhaustive investigation is continuing to identify how and at what
point MEF-1 was introduced, and routine quality control measures are being
tightened. In addition, a number of OPV batches and bulks produced before
and after the vaccine in question are being tested to confirm the absence
of MEF-1. Until testing is completed, alternative vaccine sources are being
used.

[A report on this outbreak was posted in on 23 Mar 2003 (ProMED-mail
Poliovirus, wild type 2 - India (Uttar Pradesh):
RFI 20030323.0721). More information was presented in an announcement in
the Weekly Epidemiologic Record Vol 78 No.12 p.88 (available at:
<http://www.who.int/wer/2003/wer7812.pdf>) in April 2003.
The investigation discussed above is both very intriguing as it suggests
that vials of oral poliovirus vaccine coming from one bulk batch of vaccine
were contaminated with MEF-1 (the wild poliovirus type 2 strain used in the
production of inactivated poliovirus vaccine - IPV) and impressive for the
depth of the investigation and its findings. It does not provide further
information as to whether this batch of vaccine was contaminated at the
production site, or at the vial filling site (vaccine production results in
"batches" (also known as "bulk") of vaccine that are massed
produced. These batches are then used to fill smaller vials holding
amounts of vaccine reasonable for use at vaccination sites (ranging from
single dose vials to multidose vials that can contain as many as 100
doses). The preparation and filling of these vials can be done at the
manufacturers facility, or sometimes is done at a vaccine laboratory in
another country). Of interest, there is a vaccine manufacturer in India
that repackages bulk oral poliovirus vaccine received from a producer in
another country.
Further intriguing information was found in the April 2003 Polio Lab
Network Quarterly Vol. IX Issue 1 (accessible at:
<http://www.who.int/vaccines/en/poliolab/2003/VolumeIXIssue1April%202003.PDF>
where there was a discussion on the identification of the MEF-1 virus in
reference laboratories, mentioning that one of the unknowns provided in a
proficiency test that was distributed to reference laboratories as part of
quality assurance activities contained the MEF-1 virus.
"Last December, a WHO Network Laboratory participating in a (non-WHO)
National Quality Assurance program discovered that one of the unknowns
provided in a proficiency test consisted of Sabin and wild poliovirus type
2 mixtures. The quality assurance laboratory immediately notified all
participating laboratories to destroy the test sample and any materials
derived from it.
In February of this year, the RIVM Specialized Reference Laboratory
[Laboratory for Vaccine-Preventable Diseases, National Institute for Public
Health and the Environment of the Netherlands] informed all Network
Laboratories performing ELISA intratypic differentiation (ITD) tests that
traces of wild poliovirus had been found in the Sabin-like antisera
supplied for the test. The ITD antisera are prepared by cross-absorption of
Sabin-like antisera with prototype wild poliovirus of the same serotype. By
analogy, traces of Sabin virus may be found in non-Sabin-like antisera
prepared in the same manner.
Fortunately, the solution to the problem is simple. All laboratories in
receipt of the ITD reagents have complied with the RIVM instructions to
heat inactivate the sera (and virus) at 56 degrees Celsius for 30 min.
The RIVM investigation of its ELISA ITD test antisera grew out of an
investigation in India of the origins of isolates similar to a wild
poliovirus type 2 reference strain. Since November 2002, 7 isolates from
AFP cases in Northern India have been found to be closely related to the
type 2 strain MEF-1, which is used for production of inactivated polio
vaccine (IPV). It is unrelated to wild poliovirus found anywhere in the
world over the past 2 decades.
MEF-1 replicates vigorously and has been one of the more common laboratory
contaminants over the years, but there is no evidence to suggest that RIVM
antisera are involved. A joint Government of India and WHO investigation is
now underway (WER No. 12, 2003, p88)."
The above information suggests that there may have been a laboratory
accident that resulted in the contamination of oral poliovirus vaccine used
in the vaccination program. Information available at this point in time
does not specify the suspected quantity of vaccine that was contaminated
(number of vials or number of doses of vaccine potentially vaccinated). We
await further information on the origin of the MEF-1 contamination of the
oral poliovirus vaccine used in India that was apparently associated with
this cluster of paralytic cases. - Mod.MPP]
