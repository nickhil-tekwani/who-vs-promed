West Nile virus (WNV) infection is one of the possibilities, but the stiff
legs and wings were not indicative of WNV-infected American crows -- flaccid
paralysis was more common.�
WNV strains in the eastern hemisphere are not known to be virulent for birds
except for the Israel Goose strain, which could be introduced elsewhere
besides North America.�
The easiest way to screen for WNV in crows is to use the simple dip-stick test
(VecTest) on oral and cloacal swabs from live and recently dead crows. See
webpage at:

PCR confirmatory tests would be beneficial.

[West Nile virus infection is only one of many possible explanations for the
death of large numbers of crows in Mumbai and surroundings. Dr. McLean has
pointed out that West Nile virus strains in the eastern hemisphere are not
known to be virulent for [wild] birds. This true throughout the range of West
Nile virus in Western Europe. The American experience is the exception.
Use of the rapid user-friendly diagnostic test described by Dr. McLean would
resolve the question without delay, and allow attention to be focused on
potentially greater hazards such as environmental pollution. - Mod.CP]
