The Mill Creek Animal Hospital recently diagnosed 3 cases of canine schistosomiasis in dogs in Moab, Utah. A parasitic worm found in freshwater, reported mostly in the Atlantic and Gulf Coast states, causes the disease, also known as "snail fever," announced the hospital on social media last week.

Dr. Scott Dolginon on Tue 27 Nov 2018 told the Times-Independent that 2 of the dogs died and a 3rd is recovering.

"One dog had a long history of illness," said Dolginon, the veterinarian at Mill Creek Animal Hospital; that dog died earlier this fall. But on the day Dolginon euthanized the dog, a 2nd dog in the home fell ill, he said, and it, too, was put down after it developed kidney failure.

Dolginon said he performed a necropsy on the animals and sent tissue samples to a lab at Colorado State University [CSU], where a pathologist found the fluke, or parasite, that causes canine schistosomiasis. Dolginon also said there were lesions on the 2nd dog's kidneys; the CSU pathologist believed the lesions were unrelated to what killed the dog, but Dolginon studied the issue and discovered that flukes also cause kidneys to rapidly develop calcium deposits.

Meanwhile, said Dolginon, a neighbor's dog became ill, and Dolginon said he sent samples to the only lab in the country testing for snail fever, Texas A&M Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory (TVMDL). The diagnosis was positive. The dog was successfully treated.

The state of Utah sent investigators to take samples, and the pond was drained, said Dolginon.

While Dolginon's sleuthing led to the cause of the illnesses and deaths, he said it might never be known how the parasite made it so far west. Stressing that his comment was pure speculation, Dolginon said climate change could be behind the microorganism migration. "Nobody knows that," he said. "It's a fluke. There are different species of flukes. A waterfowl could have infected a snail and the snail got in the water."

Clinical signs of schistosomiasis in dogs include weight loss, bloody diarrhea, decreased appetite, and increased thirst and urination.

Dolginon said he will likely publish a report on his findings, saying he and his staff believe they have an ethical responsibility to warn the community and other veterinarians that a potentially fatal canine disease not normally found in the West has been diagnosed. He said anyone observing symptoms of snail fever in a dog needs to get to a veterinarian. "If caught early, it is treatable," he said.

[_Heterobilharzia americana_ (HA), the causative agent of canine schistosomiasis, is a flatworm with a freshwater snail as an intermediate host.

HA infection occurs in younger, larger-breed indoor dogs. Hypercalcemia does not resolve without praziquantel treatment. Prognosis is good, and neither hypercalcemic-induced renal failure nor ascites appears to worsen the prognosis. Dogs in affected areas, or who have traveled to affected areas, that present for weight loss, gastrointestinal or liver disease, and hypercalcemia should be tested (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20002553).

The causative agent, _Heterobilharzia americana_, is a trematode closely related to _Schistosoma_ spp., which is known to infect humans in emerging countries. Transmission is via penetration of the skin by cercariae in water sources containing the snail intermediate host. The natural reservoirs for _H. americana_ are raccoons and other varmints (http://vetmed.tamu.edu/gilab/service/assays/heterobilharzia-americana).

Generally, canine schistosomiasis is an underdiagnosed disease in dogs. It is found most frequently in the coastal regions of the Gulf Coast and even in the south Atlantic region of the USA. So, it stands to reason that TVMDL [Texas A&M Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory] would be interested in developing a test for this. Clinical signs in dogs may include hypercalcemia, often found on necropsy along with systemic mineralization. When it is disseminated, it often involves the other organs, including the lungs, the liver, the pancreas, and both the large and small intestines. Oftentimes the mineralization appears to be within the soft tissues when it is actually a calcification of a very high number of the _H. americana_ eggs.

The snail carrying this disease may have been carried by a bird or may have been brought by someone who released some snails without knowing the danger.

All diseases seem to have the ability to move, and location is not a guarantee of safety. - Mod.TG
