Addendum to the recommended composition of influenza virus vaccines
for use in the 2005-2006 influenza season
--------------------------------------------------
WHO published interim recommendations on the composition of influenza
vaccines for use in the 2005-2006 influenza season on 10 Feb 2005.
The decision on A(H3N2) candidate vaccine viruses was postponed
pending the identification of a suitable high growth reassortant.
Based on the results of antigenic and genetic analyses and growth in
hens' eggs, obtained by WHO Collaborating Centers for Reference and
Research on Influenza and Reference Laboratories, a high growth
reassortant virus derived from A/New York/55/2004
(A/California/7/2004-like) virus and A/PR/8/34, is suitable as a
candidate A(H3N2) vaccine virus.
Accordingly, it is recommended that the vaccines for use in the
2005-2006 influenza season (northern hemisphere winter) contain the
following:
A trivalent vaccine containing:
* an A/New Caledonia/20/99(H1N1)-like virus
* an A/California/7/2004(H3N2)-like virusa
* a B/Shanghai/361/2002-like virus b
a A/New York/55/2004 is available as a vaccine virus
b The currently used vaccine viruses are B/Shanghai/361/2002,
B/Jiangsu/10/2003 and B/Jilin/20/2003 (see: Recommended composition
of influenza virus vaccines for use in the 2005-2006 influenza season
