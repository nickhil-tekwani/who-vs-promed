[1] UK: B.1.617.2 variant

The Delta variant of concern first identified in India [B.1.617.2] is now dominant in Britain and might have an increased risk of hospitalisation compared to the Alpha variant, Public Health England (PHE) said on Thursday [3 Jun 2021]. 5472 new cases of the Delta variant were reported in latest weekly figures, taking the total confirmed cases of the variant to 12 431, PHE said, adding it had overtaken Alpha, the variant first identified in England's Kent, as Britain's dominant variant.

The Delta variant is also thought to be more transmissible than Alpha, and prime minister Boris Johnson has warned that it could derail plans for lockdown restrictions in England to end on 21 Jun 2021. "With this variant now dominant across the UK, it remains vital that we continue to exercise caution, particularly while we learn more about transmission and health impacts," said Jenny Harries, chief executive, UK Health Security Agency.

PHE said that early evidence suggested there may be an increased risk of hospitalisation for Delta, also known as B.1.617.2, compared to Alpha, known as B.1.1.7, but more data were needed in order to have more confidence in that finding.

PHE said there continued to be a "substantially increased growth rate for Delta compared to Alpha" but did not [expand] on the transmissibility advantage of the variant. Officials have previously said that Delta could be from a few percentage points to 50% more transmissible than the Alpha variant, and the extent of that advantage could determine whether restrictions can be lifted on 21 Jun 2021.

[2] Research: quantitation of SARS-CoV-2 virions

ref: Sender R, Bar-On YM, Gleizer S, et al. The total number and mass of SARS-CoV-2 virions. Proc Natl Acad Sci. 2021; 118(25): e2024815118. https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2024815118

Abstract: Quantitatively describing the time course of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection within an infected individual is important for understanding the current global pandemic and possible ways to combat it. Here we integrate the best current knowledge about the typical viral load of SARS-CoV-2 in bodily fluids and host tissues to estimate the total number and mass of SARS-CoV-2 virions in an infected person. We estimate that each infected person carries 109 to 1011 virions during peak infection, with a total mass in the range of 1 micrograms (mcg) to 100 mcg, which curiously implies that all SARS-CoV-2 virions currently circulating within human hosts have a collective mass of only 0.1 kg to 10 kg. We combine our estimates with the available literature on host immune response and viral mutation rates to demonstrate how antibodies markedly outnumber the spike proteins, and the genetic diversity of virions in an infected host covers all possible single nucleotide substitutions.

Significance: Knowing the absolute numbers of virions in an infection promotes better understanding of disease dynamics and response of the immune system. Here we use current knowledge on the concentrations of virions in infected individuals to estimate the total number and mass of SARS-CoV-2 virions in an infected person. Although each infected person carries an estimated 1 billion to 100 billion virions during peak infection, their total mass is no more than 0.1 mg. This curiously implies that all SARS-CoV-2 virions currently in all human hosts have a mass of between 100 g and 10 kg. Combining the known mutation rate and our estimate of the number of infectious virions, we quantify the formation rate of genetic variants.

Discussion: ...One of the strengths of a holistic quantitative analysis such as the one performed here is its ability to expose interesting "quirks" that are otherwise elusive. One such observation is the ratio of approximately 104 between the RNA copies measured using RT-PCR and the number of infectious units measured in TCID50. Ratios on the order of 10e3 to 10e4 between viral particles and PFUs were observed in animal viruses such as poliovirus and papillomavirus (63 [see source URL for complete references]). Naively, such a ratio would suggest that only 0.01% of the virions produced are actually infectious. This ratio implies that SARS-CoV-2 is not very efficient in producing infectious progeny. While we do not have a clear explanation for this seeming low efficiency, there are several possible factors that will affect this ratio. First, measuring RNA copies may not correspond directly to actual virions but also measures naked viral RNA. Second, while TCID50 is the most widely available assay for measuring infectious titer, it may not accurately reflect the actual number of infectious virions, for example, because conditions in the assay may not be optimal for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Another possibility is that many virions are noninfectious due to the neutralizing effect of binding antibodies, and thus the ratio may represent the effect of the immune response and change over the period of infection.

Beyond exposing these quantitative aspects, a holistic analysis allows us to identify major knowledge gaps in the available literature. For example, the virion yield per infected cell is known only from a few studies on different kinds of betacoronavirus from over 40 years ago (22,23). Similarly, measurements of the mutation rate per nucleotide per cycle in SARS-CoV-2 are of much interest but missing. As discussed above, the quantitative relationship between viral RNA copies, viral particles, and infectious units is not fully characterized for SARS-CoV-2, and thus further research could help better constrain and explain the differing values. In addition, a model describing the quantitative relationship between antibody production and infection metrics would help quantitatively test the estimates presented here.

It has excellent figures, especially Figure 3 depicting "the relationship between the number of virions produced in an infected individual and the evolution of SARS-CoV-2. We use our estimates for the total number of virions produced during an infection, along with other epidemiological and biochemical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, to estimate the rate of mutation accumulation within an infected host (A) and within the population (B)." This is important to understand the threat this virus poses if we allow it to spread in the population. - Mod.LK]

Five blood clotting events occurred among almost 290 000 health care workers vaccinated with the AstraZeneca/Oxford COVID vaccine in South Africa, according to interim safety data published yesterday [2 Jun 2021] in a New England Journal of Medicine letter [see details below].

The AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine, which had its emergency use paused by the South Africa Health Products Regulatory Authority earlier in the year [2021], is currently undergoing a phase 3b trial in what will be a 500 000-person cohort of South African healthcare workers. The interim data include 288 368 vaccinated persons between 17 Feb and 12 Apr 2021.

About 2% of all participants reported adverse events, 81% of which were mild-to-moderate reactogenicity. Fifty events were of serious or of special interest, such as getting infected with the coronavirus within 28 days post-vaccination (12), allergic reactions (12, one of which was anaphylaxis), and neurological conditions (6), including a 40 year old man who was later diagnosed with Guillain-Barre syndrome and a 53 year old woman with Bell's palsy.

Five arterial, venous thrombotic, or embolic events occurred in 5 participants with known risk factors (1.7 events per 100 000 people; less than 0.002% of the cohort). All instances occurred in women 38-65 years of age. The only fatal clotting instance occurred 23 days post-vaccination in a 63-year-old woman who was overweight and had high blood pressure, diabetes, and a history of venous thrombosis.

While other patient comorbidities included HIV, rheumatic heart disease, chronic pulmonary emboli, and diabetes, one woman who experienced signs of a transient ischemic attack 8 days post-vaccination had the only noteworthy condition of giving birth to twins 9 months prior.

"The rate of adverse events with vaccination is low, and thromboembolic events have occurred mainly in persons with risk factors for thromboembolism," the researchers conclude. They add, "To date, no case of vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia has been documented."

Dental professionals [in the United Kingdom] were at heightened occupational risk for COVID-19 infection early in the COVID-19 pandemic, according to an observational study yesterday [2 Jun 2021] in the Journal of Dental Research.

A team led by University of Birmingham researchers obtained blood samples from 1507 dentists, dental nurses, and dental hygienists in the Birmingham, England, region in June 2020. They found that 16.3% of participants had SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, compared with an estimated 6% to 7% of the general population. Dental receptionists who don't have direct patient contact, however, were no more likely than community members to have coronavirus antibodies, at 6.3%.

Race was a significant risk factor for COVID-19, as shown by antibody detection in 35.0% of Black and 18.8% of Asian dental professionals, versus 14.3% of White participants. Living in socioeconomically disadvantaged areas was also a risk factor. The authors noted that although the study had a relatively small sample size, the results were similar to previous studies involving non-dental healthcare workers.

The researchers obtained follow-up blood samples from most participants in September 2020, after dentist offices had reopened with improved personal protective equipment (PPE) and infection control protocols, and again in January 2021, amid the 2nd pandemic wave and healthcare worker vaccination rollout.

Of professionals who had SARS-CoV-2 antibodies at the 1st blood draw, over 70% still had antibodies 3 and 6 months later, and their risk of reinfection was 75% lower than those not previously infected. From June 2020 to January 2021, seroprevalence rose 12.3% in the Birmingham area while infection risk in seronegative study participants was 11.7%. "This implies that the enhanced PPE and infection control practices appeared effective in reducing risk of occupational exposure of [dental professionals] to SARS-CoV-2 to background population levels," the researchers wrote.

By January 2021, antibodies were detected in 51.4% of all participants and in 19.7% of professionals who were seronegative at baseline, which the researchers attributed to natural infection.

No participants who had blood antibody levels above 147.6 IU/mL tested positive for COVID-19 from the 1st to the last blood draws. Noting that only 5.3% of participants had an antibody level above 147.6 IU/mL during the 1st pandemic wave, corresponding study author Thomas Dietrich said in a University of Birmingham press release, "This suggests that natural infection alone is unlikely to generate meaningful, durable herd immunity."

The only reinfected professionals were those without a detectable anti-spike protein immunoglobulin G (IgG) response, either because they had undetectable IgG concentrations at baseline or because their IgG response dwindled over time.

Among participants with antibodies, 60.2% recalled having a symptomatic illness, 25.6% reported cough, 23.3% reported fever, and 39.0% said they lost their sense of taste or smell.

The study also showed that the 1st dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine generated a 97.7% antibody response after 12 days in participants not previously infected. Those who had antibodies at the 1st blood draw had an even faster and more robust immune response after the 1st dose.

Lead author Adrian Shields said in the release that understanding the meaning of antibody tests results is critical to ending the pandemic. "Our study has taken the 1st steps in defining the level of antibody in a persons' blood necessary to protect them from infection for 6 months," he said. "Furthermore, by comparing the antibody levels we have found in dentists to those contained in widely available reference material produced by the World Health Organization, we hope the protective level we found can be easily confirmed and compared by other laboratories."

Dental professionals have been thought to be at increased occupational risk of COVID-19 because of their routine exposure to patients' airways and performance of aerosol-generating procedures, the authors said. The researchers called for future research on the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccination strategies (for example, different doses, vaccine combinations) and on variants of concern. "Further studies are necessary to comprehensively understand whether these comparative statistics represent a true lowering of exposure rates of [dental professionals] following reopening of general dental practices and the additional precautions taken to ensure practices became COVID-19 secure," they wrote.

Abstract
"Dental care professionals (DCPs) are thought to be at enhanced risk of occupational exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, robust data to support this from large-scale seroepidemiological studies are lacking. We report a longitudinal seroprevalence analysis of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein, with baseline sampling prior to large-scale practice reopening in July 2020 and follow-up postimplementation of new public health guidance on infection prevention control (IPC) and enhanced personal protective equipment (PPE). In total, 1507 West Midlands DCPs were recruited into this study in June 2020. Baseline seroprevalence was determined using a combined IgGAM enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and the cohort followed longitudinally for 6  months until January/February 2021 through the 2nd wave of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic in the United Kingdom and vaccination commencement. Baseline seroprevalence was 16.3%, compared to estimates in the regional population of 6% to 7%. Seropositivity was retained in over 70% of participants at 3- and 6-month follow-up and conferred a 75% reduced risk of infection. Nonwhite ethnicity and living in areas of greater deprivation were associated with increased baseline seroprevalence. During follow-up, no polymerase chain reaction-proven infections occurred in individuals with a baseline anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG level greater than 147.6  IU/mL with respect to the World Health Organization international standard 20-136. After vaccination, antibody responses were more rapid and of higher magnitude in those individuals who were seropositive at baseline. Natural infection with SARS-CoV-2 prior to enhanced PPE was significantly higher in DCPs than the regional population. Natural infection leads to a serological response that remains detectable in over 70% of individuals 6  months after initial sampling and 9  months from the peak of the 1st wave of the pandemic. This response is associated with protection from future infection. Even if serological responses wane, a single dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech 162b vaccine is associated with an antibody response indicative of immunological memory."]

The cumulative COVID-19 infection prevalence rate among US dentists was 2.6% as of November 2020 -- lower than the infection rate of other front-line health care professionals, including nurses and physicians, according to a study from the American Dental Association Science & Research Institute and Health Policy Institute.

"COVID-2019 among dentists in the United States: a 6-month longitudinal report of accumulative prevalence and incidence," published in the June [2021] issue of the Journal of the American Dental Association (JADA), is based on online survey data collected 8 Jun-13 Nov 2020, from 2196 US dentists in private practice or public health about the COVID-19 testing they received, the symptoms they experienced and the infection prevention procedures they followed in their primary practice.

Dentists' COVID-19 incidence rates ranged from 0.2%-1.1% each month, and the average incidence rate over the 6 months was 0.5%.

"We're pleased to see that dentists have demonstrated continued low monthly incidence of disease despite several regional and national COVID-19 rate spikes during the study period," said Marcelo Araujo, CEO of the ADA Science & Research Institute, chief science officer of the ADA and senior author of the report.

In May 2020, a survey of US front line health care workers, including nurses and physicians, found their reported COVID-19 prevalence rate to be 29%.

The ADA study is a continuation of the 1st large-scale report of US dentists' COVID-19 infection rates and infection control practices published in October 2020 by JADA. The results were weighted according to age and location to approximate all US dentists.

Of the initial 2196 respondents, 1291 participated in the final survey and 785 participated in all 6. Fifty-seven dentists total reported ever receiving a COVID-19 diagnosis. The likely source of COVID-19 was identified via contact tracing by a health agency or clinic in 23 of those cases, with the dental practice identified as the likely infection source in 2 instances.

Because many dental procedures generate aerosols, practicing dentistry was originally believed to present a high risk of transmitting SARS-CoV-2 to dental professionals. During the study period, the rate of dentists performing aerosol-generating procedures increased from 92.8% in the 1st month to 98.4% in the last.

At least 99.7% of dentists said they used enhanced infection prevention and control strategies in their practice each month. A large number of dentists reported screening patients and staff for COVID-19, disinfecting between patient appointments and encouraging social distancing among patients.

"This study shows high rates of pre-appointment screening of patients and appropriate infection control measures throughout the study period, demonstrating that adhering to very strict protocols for enhanced infection control helps protect their patients, their dental team and themselves," Dr Araujo said.

Strategies to optimize personal protective equipment supplies, such as not changing masks after each patient appointment, were encouraged by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention when supplies were limited. Over the course of the study, dentists' use of these strategies decreased, as more changed their masks with every patient. After the 1st month, during which 17.6% reported changing their masks between patients, the rate never fell below 25.5% in subsequent months.

"This study reinforces that the dental care sector is up and running safely," said Marko Vujicic, chief economist and vice president of the ADA Health Policy Institute. "Nowhere is this proof point more evident than by the fact that more than 90% of patients surveyed indicate they have already visited the dentist or soon will."

[The UK study compared dentists, dental workers, and dental hygienists with the population in general. The US study compared dental workers with other health professionals. The seropositivity rate in the US dental workers was lower than that of the general UK population. The UK population was followed from June 2020 until Jan/Feb 2021, more than 6 months, through the 2nd wave of the pandemic in the UK and vaccination commencement. The US population was followed from 8 Jun-13 Nov 2020, less than 6 months. It is difficult to compare the results on dental worker risk because of the differences in the studies. But surely, if PPE is not properly worn, dentists are subject to aerosols and at risk. Vaccination should be the 1st line of defense. - Mod.LK]
