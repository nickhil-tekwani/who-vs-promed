Twenty-one doctors and health officials have been charged with
criminal offences that caused a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
outbreak in southern Kazakhstan, the chief prosecutor's office
announced on Tue 9 Jan 2007. Blood transfusions from unchecked donors
or contaminated needles have been blamed for [HIV] infection among 84
children, most of them under the age of 3 years. Some 12 mothers also
have tested positive for HIV since the first pediatric cases were
registered in the city of Shymkent during the summer of 2006. Seven
children have already died of AIDS-related diseases, while a heart
condition caused the death of an 8th, officials said.
The Chief Prosecutor's office said in a statement released on Tue 9
Jan 2007 that it had completed its investigations and charged 21
doctors and health officials with negligence. Some of them were also
charged with bribery, extortion and theft of state funds, it said.
All cases have been transferred to court, the statement said.
Authorities have checked thousands of children who were feared to
have contracted HIV at hospitals in Shymkent, some 1600 kilometres
south of the capital, Astana.
The Central Asian nation has been shocked by the outbreak, and
subsequent nationwide inspections have revealed numerous cases of
incompetence and corruption among doctors and nurses.

[This report confirms that the outbreak of HIV infection among
children in the city of Shymkent in 2006 has been a consequence of
deficiencies in blood transfusion procedures and inadequate
sterilization of instruments and injection needles. Tragically the
number of children infected as a consequence of this clinical
negligence has risen from 55 to 84, and some of the mothers have also
contracted HIV infection subsequently.
