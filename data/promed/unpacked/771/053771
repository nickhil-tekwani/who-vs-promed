Argentina posted a record one-day number of new COVID-19 cases of 41 080 on Thursday [27 May 2021], amid a 2nd wave of infections that has made the country one of the hardest hit in the world, pushing the local healthcare system to its limit.

The nation of 45 million inhabitants has so far registered a total 3 663 215 cases and 76 135 deaths, according to official data, making it one of the countries with the most deaths per capita, along with neighbors Uruguay, Paraguay, and Brazil.

Argentina began a strict lockdown for 9 days on Saturday [22 May 2021] to get the virus under control. But the rollout of its vaccination program has been slower than promised by the center-left government of President Alberto Fernandez.

Current lockdown measures include a suspension of in-person school classes, a nightly curfew, and takeout-only restaurant service.

Brazil
------
Brazil has recorded 67 467additional confirmed cases of coronavirus in the past 24 hours, along with 2245 deaths from COVID-19, the Health Ministry said. Brazil has registered more than 16.3 million cases since the pandemic began, while the official death toll has risen to 456 674, according to ministry data.

Mexico
------
Mexico's health ministry has reported 3050 new confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the country and 429 more fatalities, bringing the total to 2 405 772 infections and 222 661 deaths. The government has said the real number of cases is likely significantly higher, and separate data suggested the actual death toll is at least 60% above the confirmed figure.

Meanwhile, Mexico's health regulator COFEPRIS has granted emergency use authorisation to Johnson & Johnson's vaccine against COVID-19, Deputy Health Minister Hugo Lopez-Gatell said on Thursday [27 May 2021]. "This authorisation for emergency use certifies that the vaccine meets the quality, safety, and efficacy requirements necessary to be applied," COFEPRIS said in a separate statement.

Australia
---------
Australia's Victoria state has reported 4 new locally acquired COVID-19 cases, the 1st day of a one-week hard lockdown imposed to contain a growing coronavirus outbreak in state capital Melbourne. Victoria, Australia's 2nd most populous state, entered into the lockdown on Thursday [27 May 2021] night, due to run until 3 Jun 2021, forcing its near 7 million residents to remain home except for essential business.

Abstract
--------
"The northern state of Amazonas is among the regions in Brazil most heavily affected by the COVID-19 epidemic and has experienced 2 exponentially growing waves, in early and late 2020. Through a genomic epidemiology study based on 250 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus  2 (SARS-CoV-2) genomes from different Amazonas municipalities sampled between March 2020 and January 2021, we reveal that the 1st exponential growth phase was driven mostly by the dissemination of lineage B.1.195, which was gradually replaced by lineage B.1.1.28 between May and June 2020. The 2nd wave coincides with the emergence of the variant of concern (VOC) P.1, which evolved from a local B.1.1.28 clade in late November 2020 and replaced the parental lineage in less than 2 months. Our findings support the conclusion that successive lineage replacements in Amazonas were driven by a complex combination of variable levels of social distancing measures and the emergence of a more transmissible VOC P.1 virus. These data provide insights to understanding the mechanisms underlying the COVID-19 epidemic waves and the risk of dissemination of SARS-CoV-2 VOC P.1 in Brazil and, potentially, worldwide."

Discussion
----------
"...In summary, our findings support that lineage replacements were a recurrent phenomenon in the local evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in Amazonas state, driven by ecological and virological factors. Our findings also indicate that NPIs [nonpharmaceutical interventions] deployed in Amazonas state in April 2020 were sufficiently effective to reduce the Re of early prevalent local SARS-CoV-2 clades but were insufficient to keep the epidemic under control, allowing the establishment and local persistence of several endemic viral lineages and subsequent emergence of the VOC P.1 in late November/early December 2020. The lack of efficient social distancing and other mitigation measures probably allowed a sudden and accelerated transmission of VOC P.1. At the same time, the higher transmissibility of this VOC further fueled the rapid upsurge in SARS-CoV-2 cases and hospitalizations observed in Manaus following its emergence. Importantly, phylodynamic modeling indicates that NPIs implemented in Manaus since early January 2021 [see URL for Supplementary Note] effectively reduced the median Re of the VOC P.1 by approximately 50%. Therefore, our results suggest that weak adoption of NPIs represents a risk for the continuous emergence of new variants. Implementation of efficient mitigation measures, combined with widespread vaccination, will be crucial to controlling the spread of SARS-CoV-2 VOCs in Brazil."

[3] Blood clots
[3A] Causation
Date: Thu 27 May 2021 09:14 IST

https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/europe/german-scientists-claim-to-have-solved-covid-vaccine-blood-clot-puzzle-1.4576752


Scientists in Germany claim to have cracked the cause of the rare blood clots linked to the Oxford/AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson coronavirus vaccines and believe the jabs could be tweaked to stop the reaction happening altogether.

Rolf Marschalek, a professor at Goethe University in Frankfurt who has been leading studies into the rare condition since March [2021], said his research showed the problem sat with the adenovirus vectors that both vaccines use to deliver the genetic instructions for the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body.

The delivery mechanism means the vaccines send the DNA gene sequences of the spike protein into the cell nucleus rather than the cytosol fluid found inside the cell where the virus normally produces proteins, Prof Marschalek and other scientists said in a preprint paper released on Wednesday [26 May 2021].

Once inside the cell nucleus, certain parts of the spike protein splice, or split apart, creating mutant versions, which are unable to bind to the cell membrane where important immunisation takes place. The floating mutant proteins are instead secreted by cells into the body, triggering blood clots in roughly one in 100 000 people, according to Prof Marschalek's theory.

In contrast, mRNA-based vaccines, such as the jabs developed by BioNTech/Pfizer and Moderna, deliver the spike's genetic material to the cell fluid, and it never enters the nucleus. "When these...virus genes are in the nucleus, they can create some problems," Prof Marschalek told the Financial Times.

The rare blood-clotting reaction that has disrupted the rollout of the AstraZeneca and J&J shots has been recorded in 309 of the 33 million people who have received the AstraZeneca vaccine in the UK, causing 56 deaths. In Europe, at least 142 people have experienced the blood clots out of 16 million recipients of the vaccine.

In response, use of the AstraZeneca jab has been restricted or suspended in more than a dozen countries. J&J began the rollout of its vaccine in Europe with a warning on its label in April [2021] after a brief delay because of the concerns.

But Prof Marschalek believes there is a straightforward "way out" if the vaccine developers can modify the gene sequence that codes for the spike protein to prevent it splitting apart. J&J had already contacted Prof Marschalek's lab to ask for guidance and was looking at ways to adapt its vaccine to prevent splicing, he said.

The instructions for the spike protein in the J&J shot were already less prone to "splicing" than the instructions for the spike protein in the AstraZeneca jab, making the reaction less common, according to Prof Marschalek. In the USA, 8 of the 7.4 million recipients of the J&J shot have reported the rare reaction.

"[J&J] is trying to optimise its vaccine now," he said. "With the data we have in our hands we can tell the companies how to mutate these sequences, coding for the spike protein in a way that prevents unintended splice reactions." J&J said: "We are supporting continued research and analysis of this rare event as we work with medical experts and global health authorities. We look forward to reviewing and sharing data as it becomes available."

Some scientists have cautioned that Prof Marschalek's theory is one among many, and that further evidence is needed to substantiate his claims. "There is evidence missing to show the causal chain from the splice...of the spike protein to the thrombosis events," said Johannes Oldenburg, professor of transfusion medicine at the University of Bonn. "This is still a hypothesis that needs to be proven by experimental data."

Prof Marschalek said he had presented his lab's findings to the German government's Paul-Ehrlich Institute and to the country's advisory body on vaccination and immunisation. "They were surprised by our findings because no one was thinking about the splice problem," he said.

Research Square. DOI: 10.21203/rs.3.rs-558954/v1 [not yet peer reviewed].

"Discussion. Here, [the authors] present 1st molecular evidence that vector-based vaccines encoding the Spike protein exhibit a problem that is completely absent in mRNA-based vaccines. This is due to the fact that during the vaccination step, the adenoviral DNA enters the nucleus and uses the host machinery to transcribe its (trans)genes inside the nucleus. However, RNA viruses have evolved in the absence of any post-transcriptional modification systems that are usually enabled to process the primary RNA transcripts of nuclear encoded genes."

"...Soluble Spike variants together with newly built antibodies against Spike protein as well as the highly specific blood-flow conditions in the central venous sinus of the brain may result in the rare but severe events after vaccination observed with ADZ1222/Vaxzevria."

"In principle, such thromboses may occur in any site of the human body where endothelial cells express ACE2. Soluble Spike proteins which still exhibit the important core portion of the S1 domain (R319-F551) will be able to bind these receptors. When the immune system starts to produce antibodies against the Spike protein, the endothelial cells will not only bind the soluble Spike protein variants but would also be decorated with the newly formed antibodies. This will give rise to strong inflammatory reactions either by ADCC (antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity) or CDC (complement-dependent cytotoxicity) occurring in these vessels at various sites where such soluble Spike protein variants accumulate. In ADCC, NK cells could be recruited via their surface receptors (CD16 or CD32) to increase inflammation. During CDC, the C1q protein may recognize the local accumulation of Fc receptors to attract C3b, and thus, will recruit erythrocytes that express the CR1 receptor on their surface or will cause cell damage and inflammation via the normal complement cascade (18)." - Mod LK]

[3B] Opinion
Date: Thu 27 May 2021
Source: Bloomberg News [abridged, edited]
https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-05-27/vaccine-blood-clot-side-effects-is-there-a-fix-for-astrazeneca-and-j-j


The rollout of COVID-19 vaccines developed by AstraZeneca Plc and the University of Oxford and Johnson & Johnson has been marred by rare but serious blood-clotting side effects that resulted in some deaths. Now, scientists in Germany say they have uncovered the cause of the clotting condition and can fix it. Sam Fazeli, a Bloomberg Opinion contributor who covers the pharmaceutical industry for Bloomberg Intelligence, answers questions about the new findings. The conversation has been edited and condensed.

Can you explain this latest development and how it may further our understanding of these side effects?

Everyone is keen to understand what is causing the very rare blood clotting issues seen with the so-called adenoviral-vectored vaccines developed by Astra-Oxford and J&J. What is unusual about these issues is that they are blood clots that form in odd parts of the body, such as the cerebral sinus vein, at the same time as a reduction in platelets, which normally leads to bleeding. If we know why they occur, maybe we can find a way to prevent them. To this end, we already know that some Astra and J&J vaccine recipients develop an antibody directed against what's known as platelet-factor 4, which then leads to a reduction in the number of platelets.

But what about the blood clots?

That is what this study tries to answer. And I am afraid some people have taken the results of these experiments as suggesting a solution. But that is not the case. They are a very interesting set of experiments, but that's what they are. Their laboratory analysis seems to suggest that the vaccines from Astra and J&J -- which target the "spike protein," or rod-like structures that are stuck on the outside of the virus -- could produce soluble pieces of this protein. They then hypothesize that these soluble spike proteins could bind to what are known as ACE2 receptors on the inside of human blood vessels and set off an inflammatory cascade which leads to blood clotting.

How credible is this report? Does it seem like a plausible explanation for the blood clots we're seeing if confirmed by additional research?

From an experimental perspective, it looks fine. The issue is that the authors, in my view, have gone a bit too far, even in naming their finding "vaccine-induced COVID-19 mimicry" syndrome. They don't show actual evidence to support their hypothesis. Some key steps are required to prove that this is actually the way the vaccines induce blood clots, known as thromboses.

What would the process of confirming this hypothesis look like, and if it proves valid, of remediating the vaccines? Is there any regulatory or scientific precedent?

Several things can be done. The 1st is to prove that those vaccinated with the adenoviral vaccines actually have soluble spike protein in their bloodstream and that it is higher than those who have been inoculated with shots based on messenger RNA (Pfizer Inc.-BioNTech SE and Moderna Inc.). Then they need to show that there is indeed inflammation at the site of blood clots involving immune complexes with soluble spike protein and anti-spike antibodies. Additionally, if there is indeed soluble spike protein produced in sufficient quantities to matter, we need data on the time course of this and how it relates to the evolution of neutralizing antibodies. The authors hypothesize that the reason the clotting problem is rare is because neutralizing antibodies generally tend to form in time to bind to the soluble spike protein and stop it from sticking to the ACE2 receptors on the inside of blood vessels, and "neutralize" them. All this has yet to be proved.

But if after taking these steps the hypothesis is found to be correct, it would be relatively good news, right? Rather than a fundamental problem with this whole category of vaccines, the solution may just be tweaking the spike protein? That would be great, wouldn't it?

The companies could go back and modify their vaccines. But then they would have to prove that the modified vaccines are equally effective and, more importantly, that they don't cause the side effect. This would involve vaccinating hundreds of thousands of individuals to test this. I am not sure how feasible that is.

Does the fact that J&J's vaccine seemingly has a lower rate of these events than Astra's give any additional credence to the theory?

The operative word here is "seemingly." We have to wait for much more data. I won't be convinced that the J&J vaccine has a lower rate of such events until I see data from about the same number of vaccinations that Astra's vaccine has had. It is possible that's the case, though, given that the 2 use different adenoviruses, spike sequences, and manufacturing processes. The authors do try and use that as potential evidence in support of their hypothesis, but given how immature the data are, I don't think it's a given.

What happens with the existing vaccines and existing production if the hypothesis proves true?

Countries are still using the vaccines, so it is unlikely that this study alone would change anything. As I said, we need a lot more clinical data before anyone actually accepts this as a cause-and-effect situation. But if the hypothesis were proved to be true, then indeed those existing vaccines would have to be replaced with new ones that have the modification. All of this would take time. That's not to say it wouldn't be desirable to find a solution. These shots are seen as key in the race to vaccinate the world and tame the virus, so if we were able to remove the threat of these rare but possible deadly side effects from the equation, that would be a big step forward. But we're not there yet.

[4] Finland: cases of B1.617 variant
Date: Wed 26 May 2021
Source: Helsinki Times [edited]
https://www.helsinkitimes.fi/finland/finland-news/domestic/19289-indian-coronavirus-variant-behind-hospital-outbreak-in-kanta-haeme-finland.html


The variant of the new coronavirus [first detected in India] has been identified as the cause of a string of 80 infections detected in hospitals in Kanta-Hame, Southern Finland.

"The variant [first detected in India] is extremely easily transmissible. There's reason for concern. You can't belittle this because it's clear the protective measures that used to be enough have simply not been enough," Sally Leskinen, the chief medical officer of Kanta-Hame Hospital District, told Helsingin Sanomat. "Wearing surgical masks in all situations and meeting patients with symptoms of an infection in complete protective equipment wasn't enough now."

The chains of infection are believed to have originated from 2 sources in Kanta-Hame Central Hospital in Hameenlinna. The variant spread from the central hospital to the health centre hospitals in Forssa, Hameenlinna, and Riihimaki. The infection proved fatal for 7 elderly people with chronic diseases.

Also, family members of hospital staff have contracted the virus, resulting in large-scale exposures in schools.

"The virus has transmitted easily. In the wards that had infections before the 1st cases were detected and the chains of infection were contained, 40% of patients became infected," highlighted Leskinen.

The cluster appears to have been contained, as no new unexpected infections have popped up in the hospitals.

What is surprising about the cluster is that roughly 4/5 of the infected people had received at least the 1st dose of a coronavirus vaccine. Although the majority of staff had also received the booster dose, 11% of staff members in the ward where the outbreak began have tested positive for the virus. About half of them developed symptoms from the infection, some relatively serious ones.

Lehtinen said to Helsingin Sanomat that vaccinations can make detecting infections more challenging, as even members of risk groups may only exhibit mild symptoms at the onset of infection. The hospital district is consequently mulling over stepping up its measures to slow down the epidemic.

"We'll just have to tolerate the restrictions," she said.

"We'll likely be recommending that everyone exposed to an infection, the family members of people ordered into quarantine observe a self-quarantine, or we may even consider ordering family members into quarantine."

The experiences of the hospital district align with research findings on the efficacy of the Pfizer-Biontech vaccine against the variant 1st discovered in India. Public Health England in May [2021] reported the Pfizer-Biontech and Astra Zeneca vaccines both have a roughly 33.5% efficacy against the variant 3 weeks after the 1st injection, compared to about 50% against the variant 1st found in the UK.

Two weeks after the 2nd dose, the efficacy against the Indian variant rose to 88% for Pfizer-Biontech and to 60% for Astra Zeneca.

"This is good news," commented Olli Vapalahti, a professor of zoonotic virology at the University of Helsinki.
