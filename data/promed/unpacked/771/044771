The press service of the Chinese ministry of agriculture announced on
2 Feb 2010 that cases of FMD virus type A were registered on a cattle
farm in the Xinjiang autonomic region of China. The local media
reported that the cases of possible FMD were identified on 22 Jan
2010 in the Baicheng county, in the Aksu district. The local
authorities suspected FMD and took samples for laboratory
confirmation. The concerned agencies arranged culling of 169 cattle
to contain further spread. There were no additional cases.

[This is the 3rd reported outbreak of FMDV serotype A in cattle in
the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, northwestern China, since
October 2009. Three official OIE reports, including the last
follow-up report submitted on 2 Feb 2010 on the current outbreak, can
be accessed at
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=8688>,
including a map. All 3 outbreaks have been controlled by stamping
out. Though clinical cases were observed only in cattle, small
ruminants, present in the 3rd (current) outbreak, were culled as well.

ProMED-mail's posting 20100115.0187 included the following request
for information, which is herewith repeated: "In view of the
continued stamping-out policy in the FMDV-A outbreaks in China, and
the continued use of the term "new strain of a listed disease,"
additional information on the evolution of this epizootic in China
and the availability (or otherwise) of an efficacious vaccine are
requested." - Mod.AS]
