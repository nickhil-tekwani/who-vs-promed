According to Burkina Faso's Ministry of Health
and the World Health Organization (WHO), there is
a meningitis epidemic in Burkina Faso. So far,
over 1300 cases have been recorded, with 142
deaths (case fatality rate of over 10 percent).
Eight health districts are directly affected:
Banfora, Batie, Dano, Hounde, Nanoro, Ouargaye, Sapouy, and Titao.
The Ministry of Health (MoH) has declared a
meningitis outbreak in the districts of Ouargaye
and Banfora, where the number of cases has
surpassed the epidemic threshold. The ministry
has planned for a vaccination campaign in these
areas. In the other districts, the cases have
exceeded the alert threshold but have not yet
reached the epidemic level. The districts in the
"alert" phase -- 5 cases per 100 000 inhabitants
-- are Batie and Dano (southwest), Hounde (west),
Sapouy (south), Nanoro (centre-south), and Titao
(north). Intense surveillance is being implemented.
The Burkina Faso government, through MoH, has
begun conducting social mobilization. A
vaccination and immunization campaign is
scheduled for this week, with the technical and
financial support of partners. The campaign will
be administered free of charge countrywide and
treatment will also be made available free of charge for affected people.
Burkina Faso is in West Africa's meningitis
"belt", which stretches across the semi-arid
Sahel region -- from Senegal in the west to
Ethiopia in the east. Each year, between December
and June, sand storms combined with seasonal
respiratory infections trigger outbreaks of
meningitis. The causal bacteria are transmitted
through respiratory secretions such as sneezing
or coughing and through direct contact with infected people.

Health authorities in Cote d'Ivoire have reported
an outbreak of meningitis in the north of the
country, where the health infrastructure has
deteriorated during a more-than-4-year political
impasse that has divided the country.
As of 5 Feb 2007, 36 cases of bacterial
meningitis, including 6 deaths, had been reported
at the regional hospital in the city of Bouake,
according to the United Nations Humanitarian Coordination Office (OCHA).
"We confirm that there are cases of meningitis in
Bouake," said Souleymane Kone, spokesman for the
WHO in Cote d'Ivoire. "Also, in partnership with
the Ivorian Health Ministry, we are pursuing
investigations in other health facilities in
Bouake to see if there are other cases."
According to the Health Ministry, a vaccination
campaign is being prepared for the region of
Savanes and some districts in the region of
Bouake, 350 km. north of the main city, Abidjan.
Although Cote d'Ivoire has been divided between a
government-run south and rebel-held north since a
brief civil war in 2002, the Health Ministry is
working with WHO in Bouake, which is the rebel stronghold, without hindrance.
The UN Children's Agency (UNICEF) reported 2007's
1st cases of meningitis in mid-January in the
extreme north and northeast of the country in the
regions of Boundiali and Odienne, where 7 cases
were registered, including 1 death. UNICEF recommended mass vaccinations.
Eighty-three cases of meningitis, including 20
deaths, were reported for all of 2006 in Cï¿½d'Ivoire.

The Minister of Health, Dr. Stephen Mallinga,
arrived yesterday [Mon 19 Feb 2007] in West Nile
to assess the on-going mass vaccination against
meningitis. The 1st case of the contagious
disease was reported on 27 Dec 2007 in Arua.
Since then, at least 2000 cases have been registered with 65 deaths.
The mass immunization campaign was launched on 3
Feb 2007, after the disease reached the epidemic
threshold of 10 cases every week. The disease
also spread to Nebbi, Nyadri, Koboko, Moyo, Yumbe, and Adjumani districts.
The Arua district director for health services,
Dr. Patrick Anguzu, reported that there was a
gradual reduction in the number of new cases over
the past 2 weeks [4-18 Feb 2007] mainly due to
the completed 4 rounds of vaccination. "The most
affected sub-counties were all covered and within
the next few weeks the outbreak should be contained."
He expressed concern that there was a fresh
threat posed by an outbreak of meningitis in the
neighboring parts of the DR Congo.
