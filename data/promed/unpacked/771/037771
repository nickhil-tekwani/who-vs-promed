Warning on Equipment Is Issued After 5 Dialysis Patient Deaths
--------------------------------
The unexplained deaths of 5 kidney dialysis patients -- 4 in Indiana and
one in Michigan -- prompted federal regulators today to warn dialysis
centers to stop using a certain combination of blood tubing and dialysis
machines.
Whether the equipment is linked to the deaths is unclear, but the Food and
Drug Administration issued the warning after the Baxter Healthcare
Corporation, one of the country's largest makers of dialysis equipment,
notified the agency that the 5 patients had died and that 2 others had been
injured.
Both the agency and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in
Atlanta are investigating.
"F.D.A. is alerting the public and the medical community to this problem in
an effort to prevent other deaths and injuries," Dr. Lester M. Crawford,
the agency's deputy commissioner, said. "Although details are still
sketchy, in the interest of patient safety, F.D.A. wants to make certain
that dialysis patients and the wider medical community are aware of these
incidents."
The agency said the deaths occurred at 2 dialysis centers, Nephrology Inc.
in Mishawaka, Ind., and Physicians Dialysis Inc. in Grand Rapids, Mich.
Bill Keegan, a spokesman for the center in Indiana, said 4 patients died
and a fifth was hospitalized from 23 Aug - 5 Sep 2002, adding that it was
an unusually short period. Mr. Keegan would not release details about them,
except to say that their average age was over 60.
Doctors at Nephrology Inc. closed the center for 5 days to check and clean
the equipment, Mr. Keegan said. The center also notified the disease
control agency, as well as Baxter.
A preliminary investigation by Baxter found that all 4 patients had been
treated using the company's Meridian dialysis machines in conjunction with
blood tubing made by the Medisystems Corporation of Seattle. Deborah Spak,
a Baxter spokeswoman, said that Baxter also received a report of a fifth
death, the one in Michigan, but that it did not appear to follow the same
pattern.
"Given a few of these commonalities, we felt it appropriate to ask our
customers not to use these products," Ms. Spak said.

Baxter warns of dialysis tubing amid safety probe
------------------------------
Baxter International Inc. has warned kidney dialysis providers not to use
certain tubing with its Meridian dialysis machines after reports of 5
patient deaths and 2 injuries, US regulators announced on Thu 12 Sep 2002.
Baxter said the cause of the deaths and injuries has not been determined
and an investigation is ongoing. The Food and Drug Administration, which
announced Baxter's warning, said it is also probing the matter.
Last year, Baxter pulled some dialysis filters from the market and said a
fluid used in their manufacturing may have contributed to some patient deaths.
In a letter sent 6 Sep 2002, Baxter told providers to immediately
discontinue use of certain blood tubing made by Medisystems Corp. in
conjunction with the Meridian machine. The letter was sent to 16 dialysis
customers that may have been using the combination, Baxter spokeswoman
Deborah Spak said.
Baxter's letter said the tubing might kink when used with the Meridian machine.
The company has "no information that correlates this potential to the
unexpected patient events" but advised that providers discontinue use of
the combination "in the interest of patient safety," the letter said.
Spak said "it is unclear whether the deaths were due to underlying disease
of the patients or some element of the treatment."
Details of the incidents are "sketchy," but the FDA "is alerting the public
and the medical community to this problem in an effort to prevent other
deaths and injuries," FDA Deputy Commissioner Lester Crawford said in a
statement.
Alternative Medisystems blood tubing is available, Baxter said.
The reported patient incidents occurred at dialysis centers in Mishawaka,
Indiana, and Grand Rapids, Michigan, the FDA said.
Officials at Medisystems, based in Seattle, were not immediately available
for comment.
Deerfield, Illinois-based Baxter has reached settlements with families of
patients whose deaths were linked its dialysis filters. Baxter filters were
blamed for more than 50 deaths worldwide.

KIDNEY DIALYSIS DEATHS PROMPT BAXTER/FDA ACTION
------------------------------
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) today announced that Baxter
Healthcare Corporation has notified dialysis centers that certain blood
tubing used with Baxter's Meridian dialysis machines may possibly be linked
to 5 patient deaths and 2 injuries. These occurred at 2 kidney dialysis
centers in late August 2002.
Although the cause of the deaths has not yet been determined, Baxter on 6
Sep 2002 notified hemodialysis centers that it is exploring the possibility
that the patients' hemodialysis treatments may have used the same model
dialysis machine and bloodline set. Baxter told customers to immediately
discontinue use of certain models of Medisystems blood tubing in
conjunction with Meridian dialysis machines and use other Medisystems blood
tubing instead.
FDA is working closely with both Baxter Healthcare of Roundtop, Ill., and
Medisystems Corporation of Seattle, to identify the exact cause of the problem.
"FDA is alerting the public and the medical community to this problem in an
effort to prevent other deaths and injuries," said FDA Deputy Commissioner
Dr. Lester M. Crawford. "Although details are still sketchy, in the
interest of patient safety, FDA wants to make certain that dialysis
patients and the wider medical community are aware of these incidents."
Baxter's preliminary investigation found that the 2 hemodialysis centers
where the incidents occurred may have been using the following:
Blood tubing--Medisystems Corp., Product Code D3-9694/9793 or K3-9694/9793,
Baxter Product Code 5M9694
Hemodialysis Machine--Meridian
Alternate Medisystems blood tubing is available.
The incidents occurred at Nephrology, Inc., in Mishawaka, Ind., and
Physicians Dialysis, Inc., in Grand Rapids, Mich.

at 1-888-736-2543, option 3.

[As mentioned in the articles above, one of the companies involved in the
current recall (Baxter) was associated with an earlier recall of dialyzers
in late 2001, which was covered by ProMED-mail (see references below). The
9 Nov 2002 ProMED-mail posting (see: Unexplained dialysis deaths -
multicountry (03) 20011109.2777) there was the FDA recall notice for
specific dialyzers produced by Baxter that were implicated in 50 deaths
occurring in Spain, Croatia, Italy, Germany, Taiwan, Colombia, and the USA
(Texas and Nebraska). <http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/recalls/dialyzers110701.html>
At that time, the clinical syndrome associated with these deaths was
described as: "Most of the dialysis patients who died experienced shortness
of breath, chest tightness, cardiac arrest or stroke symptoms within hours
of being dialyzed." At that time, results of preliminary tests suggested
that a perfluorohydrocarbon-based performance fluid used in a manufacturing
step may have played a role in the deaths of these patients.
A follow-up discussion on the etiology of this episode can be found on
renal web, with references to published articles on the episode. The
perfluorohydrocarbon use was concluded to be the etiology of this incident.
<http://www.renalweb.com/letters/shaldon.htm>
In this current alert, there is no information on the clinical illnesses of
the dialysis patients leading to this alert. There is a suggestion in the
second article (from Reuters Health) that the combination of the specific
tubing (from another manufacturer) if used with the specific dialysis
machine could lead to kinking of the tubing. In the absence of information
on the clinical illnesses related to the presumed dialysis session, it is
very difficult to speculate on the possible causative etiology. Clearly a
cluster of deaths in a short period of time (2 weeks) associated with a
specific manufacturer(s) equipment/combination warrants an immediate
investigation. Given the prior history of a multinational distribution of
dialysis equipment, one can't help but wonder if this event is a
tip-of-the-iceberg phenomenon that has been occurring internationally.
More information on this current alert as well as information from other
countries (perhaps as a result of active surveillance following the issue
of this alert) would be very much appreciated. - Mod.MPP]
