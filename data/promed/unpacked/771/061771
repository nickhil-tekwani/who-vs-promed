Coca-Cola Co., the world's largest soft-drink maker, said it's
cooperating with Chinese authorities investigating the death of a
child who China News Service said died after consuming a Minute Maid
milk beverage.

The child and an adult in the northeastern Chinese city of Changchun,
became ill from food poisoning after consuming the drink, China News
Service reported today [30 Nov 2011], citing police. The report said
the drink contained pesticide, without giving further details.

Coca-Cola checked batch samples of the beverage and found the product
safe and within standards, Joanna Price, a spokeswoman, said. Minute
Maid is one of Coca-Cola's bestselling brands in China, according to
researcher Euromonitor International.

The company is cooperating closely with authorities investigating the
case, she said. "Our company takes the recent incidents in Changchun
of Jilin Province very seriously," she said.

[Sadly the article is lacking in a multitude of details. The name of
the pesticide is not given. The clinical signs and symptoms are not
given and neither is the condition of the 2nd victim.

I hope that issues of intentional or malicious poisoning possibilities
are also being examined. I would also wonder if someone, perhaps a
former employee is unhappy with the Coca-Cola company. And certainly
Coca-Cola should be looking at issues such as breach of security, or
accidents within the plant. - Mod.TG]
