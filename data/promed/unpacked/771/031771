According to Sjraar van Beek, the chairman of LTO's union-branch for
sheep and goats [* see below], it is most likely that all sheep farms
in [the provinces] Brabant and Limburg are infected by bluetongue.
Van Beek does not exclude the possibility that the actual number of
infected holdings is much ("several fold") higher than the official
number, namely 382 as of yesterday [27 Aug 2007] late afternoon.
The LTO union-branch rings the alarm-bell in a letter to the Minister
of Agriculture, Gerda Verburg. "A disaster is unfolding in the sheep
sector, but at the LNV (Ministry of Agriculture, Nature & Food
Quality) there are people who do not grasp this development", says
Van Beek. "Sheep are falling ill in bunches. In the entire southern
Netherlands, sheep farms that were not affected last year [2006] are
now stricken. It will not surprise me if it becomes evident that not
a single holding in Brabant and Limburg has remained unaffected by bluetongue."
The sector must be prepared for psychological help, he points out.
"Sheep breeders discover every day new sick and dead animals. No one
can stand resistant in such a situation."

[For anybody who has had the unfortunate experience of witnessing the
effects of a newly introduced, highly pathogenic bluetongue virus
strain into a susceptible sheep population, the description above
will not sound exaggerated (an example: Sardinia, 2000-2002: 12 364
affected flocks, 486 114 diseased animals, 119 950 deaths. See
ProMED-mail post 20030918.2361).
A similar picture was seen and documented by this moderator in Israel
in 1964; vaccination in subsequent years provided a satisfactory solution.
From a reliable source in Germany we got the impression that the
situation there, in the affected areas, resembles the one described
from southern Netherlands.
This should be an alarming message to areas at risk in northwestern
Europe, particularly the UK. - Mod.AS]
