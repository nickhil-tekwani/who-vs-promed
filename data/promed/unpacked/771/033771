Legionnaires' disease cases rise sharply
----------------------------------------
The number of reported cases of legionnaires' disease has risen sharply
this year, baffling federal and state health officials. The number of cases
of legionellosis reported to the federal Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) this year totaled 624 as of last week, compared with 436
for the corresponding period last year
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dbmd/diseaseinfo/legionellosis_g.htm>.
In some regions of the country, the numbers are double or triple those
reported at this time last year. Officials say the cases appear to be
random, and they have not identified any specific outbreak or source of the
bacteria that causes the disease. "There don't seem to be any explanations
yet," said Brendan Flannery, an epidemic intelligence officer with CDC in
Atlanta. The 197 cases reported in CDC's South Atlantic region was more
than double last year's 95 cases. Health officials from Delaware, Maryland,
Pennsylvania, Virginia, and North Carolina discussed the situation last
week with CDC officials.
"We're just trying to figure out what's going on, but nobody has any really
good ideas," said Diane Woolard, director of surveillance and
investigations for the Virginia Department of Health. Among the questions
officials are trying to answer is whether the apparent increase in the
prevalence of the disease is real, whether there might be problems with the
urine antigen test used to diagnose most cases, or whether reporting simply
has improved. "We've always assumed that legionnaires' is pretty
underreported," said Richard McGarvey, a spokesman for the Pennsylvania
Department of Health.
People contract legionnaires' disease after inhaling mists from a water
source contaminated with the legionella bacteria, which thrives in warm,
stagnant water. Sources can include hot water tanks, cooling towers and
evaporative condensers of large air conditioning systems, whirlpool spas,
and showers.
Symptoms of the disease include fever, chills, cough, body aches, headache,
fatigue, loss of appetite, and, occasionally, diarrhea. The disease can be
treated with antibiotics, but between 5 per cent and 30 per cent of cases
are fatal. The disease can affect anyone, but middle-aged and elderly
people are at highest risk, particularly smokers and those with chronic
lung disease. Also at increased risk are those whose immune systems are
suppressed by medications or by diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and
AIDS. The illness is called legionnaires' disease because it was first
reported at an American Legion convention in 1976 in Philadelphia, where it
made 182 people ill.

[Without more detailed demographic information, it is not clear what is
driving this increase in case numbers. The CDC website (referred to in the
article) contains the following comment that may be pertinent in its
"Trends" section: "Increasing awareness among physicians and use of more
sensitive, noninvasive tests such as urine antigen testing has led to
improved recognition of sporadic cases and outbreaks caused by _L.
pneumophila_, serogroup 1. Decreased use of culturing may be hampering
recognition of infections caused by Legionella species and serogroups." It
may be that increased surveillance activities associated with the SARS
outbreak may have contributed to an increase in testing for known causes of
"atypical pneumonia", of which legionellosis is one. - Mods.LM/MPP]
