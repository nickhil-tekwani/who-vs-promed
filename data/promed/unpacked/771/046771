The chillies grown in Heroor near Uppoor in Udupi are affected with
disease, thus putting the farmers into hardship. Chilli has developed
some disease which the farmers have not seen so far. The plant has
started withering and the ripe chillies are becoming hollow. Chillies
grown on 50 to 60 acres of land have been affected.
The plants have just started bearing fruit. In this stage, farmers
cannot use any insecticides. Most of the farmers in this part of the
region grow chillies after paddy in the month of January. Most of
them grow traditional local variety of chilli. Farmers who have
incurred loss in paddy cultivation this year are also incurring loss
in chilly cultivation.
The horticulture department officials visited Heroor and termed it as
Murda disease. They said it spreads due to mite infestation. Once the
plant is infected with the disease, the whole plant withers along
with the chilli, finally causing the death of the plant. The farmers
should destroy the disease affected plants once the disease is
noticed.

Mildew disease affecting muskmelon badly
-----------------------------------------
Downy mildew, a serious fungal disease affecting muskmelon, spreads
fast under favourable weather conditions. It has been noticed during
this [2010] season in certain parts of Punjab. If left uncontrolled,
the disease can result in severe loss in terms of reduced yield and
quality of the produce, Dr Rewal, Punjab Agricultural University,
said.
Surveys have indicated the disease affecting muskmelon fields in
different places of Kapurthala district. Experts have advised the
farmers to apply fungicide sprays. Dr Rewal suggested that the field
should be sprayed before the disease symptoms come to light. The
spray should be used at weekly interval depending upon the impact of
the disease on the crop.

[Chilli leaf curl, locally known as 'murda,' is the most destructive
disease of chilli crops in India and Sri Lanka. The term is used
specifically in chilli for disease symptoms including leaf
distortion, chlorosis and necrosis, as well as stunting of plants and
failure to produce fruit. It is a disease complex which is thought to
involve feeding damage by chilli thrips (_Scirtothrips dorsalis_) and
broad mite (_Polyphagotarsonemus latus_), as well as several viruses
including at least one whitefly transmitted leaf curl virus and
probably one or more _Tospovirus_ species. Secondary fungal or
bacterial infections via the feeding wounds may also occur. Disease
management relies mainly on systemic insecticides, and resistant
chilli varieties are being developed.
Downy mildew caused by the fungus _Pseudoperonospora cubensis_ is a
devastating disease of cucurbits and has been reported from different
locations worldwide. Different pathovars with variable host
preferences seem to exist, and, for example, a strain that affects
cucumbers may not necessarily affect melons. By affecting the leaves
and thus the photosynthetic potential of its host, downy mildew
reduces yield and fruit quality, and it can eventually kill the host.
Under favourable condition, plantings can be infected so rapidly that
they appear to have been frosted.
The fungus survives on cultivated or wild cucurbits, and volunteer
crop plants or weeds may serve as sources of inoculum. The pathogen
is spread by wind, rain splash, mechanical means and with infected
plant material. Disease management may include fungicides,
phytosanitation to eliminate inoculum, cultural measures (for example
crop rotation) and use of cultivars with low susceptibility or
resistance.
