It would be useful to get further product information in this case. My
guess is that the artichokes were in an oil dressing and received some heat
treatment after canning, and the _Clostridium botulinum_ toxin may be type B.
I find it useful to restate the conclusion of my ProMED-mail submission on
botulism caused by garlic in oil (ProMED post 20030131.0267), which read:
"This case of botulism illustrates the need to be alert and not to rule out
botulism even in widely distributed convenience foods in developed
countries. It is, furthermore, a reminder to manufacturers and authorities
to be careful, even today, that the conditions of production safeguard
against growth of _Clostridium botulinum_."
The conditions in the jars of artichokes must have been similar to the
bottled garlic; not assuring sufficient acidity and/or dissolved salt or
sugar (low redox-potential), which in turn was sufficient for outgrowth of
spores. Most importantly, anaerobic conditions are created by covering the
vegetables with oil and pasteurizing or giving similar heat treatment
insufficient for the inactivation of spores but driving out residual oxygen.
Known cases of botulism from vegetables in oil, apart from garlic and
artichokes, include eggplants, cucumbers and olives, but not tomatoes; Why?
I assume the natural acidity of tomatoes prevents the outgrowth of
botulinum spores.
