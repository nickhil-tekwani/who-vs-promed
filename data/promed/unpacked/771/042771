Coffee farmers and stakeholders have warned that Nepali coffee might be wiped out within a few years if no urgent steps were taken to protect it from coffee leaf rust (CLR). It is spreading in many coffee producing districts and has destroyed several coffee orchards.

Prachanda Man Shrestha of Beautiful Coffee Nepal said that the rust had widely destroyed the coffee plants in many districts in Nepal and demanded urgent steps to control it. "Though coffee rust was identified [only] recently, it has already spread in many orchards," he suspected.

He asked stakeholders to take prompt action with experts' advice to control the rust, or it would be too late to protect Nepali coffee. Coffee production has declined by more than 50 per cent, and plants will be totally eliminated within 5 years if urgent steps are not taken.

Coffee rust was officially identified in Nepal in April 2015. The disease was reported to have damaged coffee in Lalitpur, Kavre, Syanja, and Kaski districts. The chances of transmission to other parts of the country are equally high, as the disease is transmitted through the air.

The National Tea and Coffee Development Board (NTCDB) has formed a team to curb the transmission of the rust and devise necessary measures for its control and management. Coffee is one of the major emerging cash crops in Nepal.

[Coffee leaf rust (CLR; also called orange rust) is caused by the fungus _Hemileia vastatrix_, one of the most feared pathogens of the crop. Of the 2 coffee species grown commercially, _Coffea arabica_ (arabica or highland coffee) and _C. canephora_ (robusta or lowland coffee), it affects only arabica varieties, which are usually preferred for their taste. The rust has completely destroyed coffee industries in several countries. The disease is characterised by yellow-orange powdery lesions on the underside of leaves, where it attacks through stomata, but it rarely occurs on stems or fruit. CLR can lead to complete defoliation with death of the host plant.

Fungal spores are spread by wind, rain and mechanical means. Disease management relies mainly on multiple fungicide applications during the rainy season. Rust-resistant cultivars exist, but the crop is generally of poorer quality. More than 30 races of the fungus have been detected, making it particularly difficult to establish durable host resistance.

New fungal strains adapted to higher altitude conditions, which may also show additional fungicide resistances, have emerged in Central America recently, making CLR control in the region considerably more difficult. No information appears to be available on the rust strains involved in the problems described above for Nepal.
