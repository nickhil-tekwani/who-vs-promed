More residents in the Samara Oblast are contracting "mouse fever"
[hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome]. The number of cases has
increased 3-fold since last year [2007]. A survey of the rodents that
transmit the infection to humans has shown that 28 percent of them
are infected. Natalia Trushkina, an epidemiologist, reported that
during the 1st 10 months of 2008 there have been 222 hemorrhagic
fever cases, compared with a total of 70 in 2007.

in Russia is in the Povolzhye Federal Okrug. In some years nearly 80
percent of all cases in Russia occurred in this region. The incidence
of HFRS in this region is 3-22-fold greater than elsewhere in Russia]. - Mod.NP
