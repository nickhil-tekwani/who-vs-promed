Re: S. M. Abutarbush. Efficacy of vaccination against lumpy skin disease in Jordanian cattle
----------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
The objective of this study was to assess the value and efficacy of vaccination against a natural outbreak of lumpy skin disease (LSD). Epidemiological data were collected from 101 vaccinated and unvaccinated farms in Jordan. In the unvaccinated holdings, the overall morbidity rate was 42.6 per cent, mortality rate 10.2 per cent, and case fatality rate 23.9 per cent. Decreased feed intake, decreased milk production and fever were seen in 100 per cent, 76.9 per cent, and 92.3 per cent of the cattle farms, respectively. The percentage reduction in milk production ranged from 0 to 100 per cent (mean=38.5 per cent, SE plus/minus 9.6 per cent). The total loss/animal in the farm ranged from 27 to 2210 (mean = 486, SE plus/minus 162). In the vaccinated holdings, the overall morbidity rate was 4.7 per cent, mortality rate one per cent, and case fatality rate 22.9 per cent. Decreased feed intake, decreased milk production, and fever were seen in 23.8 per cent, 21.4 per cent, and 23.8 per cent of the cattle farms, respectively. Percentage of decrease in milk production ranged from 0 to 100 per cent (mean = 6 per cent, SE plus/minus 1.8 per cent). The total loss/animal in the farm ranged from 0 to BP 2210 (mean = 78, SE plus/minus 29). Vaccination against LSD remains a viable method of control. Although it does not provide complete protection against the disease, it appears to reduce morbidity and mortality rates, production loss and treatment cost.

[For subscribers' convenience, the "results" section (slightly abbreviated) is copied:

"A total of 1158 dairy cattle on 101 dairy cattle holdings were surveyed. The cattle on 84 of the farms were vaccinated; the cattle on 13 farms were unvaccinated, and the cattle on a further 4 farms were vaccinated after the appearance of clinical signs.

The overall morbidity, mortality and case fatality rates of the 3 different animal groups (unvaccinated, vaccinated, and vaccinated after appearance of clinical signs) were compared. Percentage of decreased feed intake, decreased milk production and fever, as well as abortion rate of the 3 different animal groups (unvaccinated, vaccinated, and vaccinated after appearance of clinical signs) were compared as well [The morbidity and mortality rates were significantly lower in the vaccinated farms; the difference in case-fatality rates were not significant. For detailed data, please refer to the full paper. - Mod.AS].

Lesions on the body, udder and teats were present in 100 per cent, 76.9 per cent, and 69.2 per cent of the unvaccinated cattle farms, respectively. In the vaccinated holdings, lesions on the body, udder and teats were present in 26.1 per cent, 10.7 per cent, and 9.5 per cent of the cattle farms, respectively. The time between vaccination and appearance of clinical signs in these farms ranged from 1-57 days (mean = 16, SE plus/minus 2.8).

In the 4 farms which were vaccinated after the appearance of the clinical disease in individual cattle, lesions on the body, udder and teats were present in 75 per cent, 50 per cent, and 50 per cent of the cattle farms, respectively. The time between appearance of clinical signs and vaccination in these farms ranged from 5 to 20 days (mean = 12.5, SE plus/minus 3.2).

Molecular characterisation of the 2 vaccines, which was carried out at the Pirbright Institute, confirmed the identity of the sheep pox vaccine strain RM 65 (Jovivac). Furthermore, the unlabelled vaccine was confirmed to be LSDV vaccine [see posting 20140816.2696557, including earlier references, and item 2 in the current posting]. It was unknown exactly which farms used the unlabelled or RM 65 vaccine; however, it appeared that most cattle received the sheep pox vaccine strain RM 65. The origin of the unlabelled vaccine was not revealed."

The observation of apparent contribution of vaccination in infected farms is in need of clarification. Could it be assumed that the vaccination was carried out during early stages of the disease in the herd, protecting the (yet) uninfected animals? - Mod.AS]

------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Lumpy skin disease is of significant economic impact for the cattle industry in Africa. The disease is currently spreading aggressively in the Near East, posing a threat of incursion to Europe and Asia. Due to cross-protection within the _Capripoxvirus_ genus, sheep pox virus (SPPV) vaccines have been widely used for cattle against lumpy skin disease virus (LSDV). In the Middle East and the Horn of Africa, these vaccines have been associated with incomplete protection and adverse reactions in cattle post-vaccination. The present study confirms that the real identity of the commonly used Kenyan sheep and goat pox vaccine virus (KSGP) O-240 is not SPPV but is actually LSDV. The low level attenuation of this virus is likely to be not sufficient for safe use in cattle, causing clinical disease in vaccinated animals. In addition, Isiolo and Kedong goat pox strains, capable of infecting sheep, goats and cattle are identified for potential use as broad-spectrum vaccine candidates against all capripox diseases.

[We are grateful to Prof Hailat for bringing this paper to our attention.

The present study provides molecular evidence that the commonly used Kenyan sheep and goat pox vaccine virus (KSGP) O-240 is actually LSDV. The authors state that the low level attenuation of this virus is likely to be not sufficient for safe use in cattle, causing clinical disease in vaccinated animals. This provides a plausible explanation for the adverse effect of cattle vaccination with the 0240 vaccine in Israel in 1992 and the justification to its discontinued application in cattle (see postings 20110814.2463 and 20140816.2696557).

As reported in 20130304.1570870, starting in early March 2013, a wide-scale field LSD vaccination trial was undertaken in Israel. The investigations were meant to address the safety and efficacy of 2 LSD vaccines under field conditions:

1. The RM65 sheep-pox live attenuated vaccine (10-fold enhanced virus contents).
2. The South African LSD live vaccine for cattle (Neethling strain).

The project was undertaken cooperatively by the State Veterinary Services, the Koret School of Veterinary Medicine, and the "Hachaklait" Clinical Veterinary Services. Results, even preliminary, will be appreciated. - Mod.AS
