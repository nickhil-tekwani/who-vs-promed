Highly pathogenic avian influenza, Korea (Rep. of)
--------------------------------------------------
Information received on 09 Dec 2010 from Dr Kiyoon Chang, CVO and
Director, Quarantine Policy Division, Food Safety and Consumer
Affairs Policy Bureau, MIFAFF (Ministry of Food, Agriculture,
Forestry and Fisheries), Gyeonggi-Do, Korea (Rep. of)

Summary
Report type: Immediate notification (Final report)
Start date 29 Nov 2010
Date of 1st confirmation of the event 07 Dec 2010
Report date 09 Dec 2010
Date submitted to OIE 09 Dec 2010
Date event resolved 07 Dec 2010
Reason for notification:Reoccurrence of a listed disease
Date of previous occurrence 15 May 2008
Manifestation of disease: Sub-clinical infection
Causal agent: Highly pathogenic avian influenza virus Serotype H5N1
Nature of diagnosis: Laboratory (advanced)
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country

New outbreaks
Outbreak 1 Chunpo-ri, Chunpo-myun, Iksan city, Cholla-Bukdo
Date of start of the outbreak 29 Nov 2010
Outbreak status: Resolved (07 Dec 2010)
Epidemiological unit Not applicable
Affected animals
Species Wild species
Susceptible 39
Cases 1
Deaths 0
Destroyed 0
Slaughtered 0

Affected Population Anas platyrhynchos (mallard duck)

Epidemiology- Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection.
Unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comments: As part of a continuous avian influenza
surveillance programme, 39 wild birds were captured and samples
(faeces, laryngo-pharyngeal swab) were collected. The NVRQS found
avian influenza antigen (H5) by PCR and confirmed it as highly
pathogenic avian influenza (H5N1) virus by gene sequencing from one
mallard duck on 7 December 2010. Clinical surveillance and
disinfection on the neighbouring poultry farms were enhanced.

Control measures - Measures applied: Movement control inside the
country; Zoning; Disinfection of infected premises/establishment(s);
Vaccination prohibited; No treatment of affected animals

Measures to be applied - No other measures

Laboratory name and type: National Veterinary Research and
Quarantine Service (NVRQS) (National laboratory)
Species Wild species
Test gene sequencing
Test date 07 Dec 2010
Result Positive

Species Wild species
Test reverse transcription - polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)
Test date 07 Dec 2010
Result Positive

Future Reporting
The event is resolved. No more reports will be submitted.

[The finding of H5N1 in a single mallard duck as part of South Korea
multi-sectorial surveillance program should not cause undue concern.
That they will not be embarking on a 2nd eradication program in the
country must be a relief indeed as the South Korea animal health
authorities certainly have their work cut out for them battling the
current FMD outbreak there.

However, it is commendable that the South Koreans are doing intensive
surveillance which can identify events such as these. Mallard can
harbor both low pathogenic and high pathogenic strains of avian
influenza and either type can be transmitted efficiently from Mallard
to other wild or commercial ducks. Webster's group at St. Jude's
summarized their studies in this regard below: This Article, in
summary, suggests that close monitoring of H5N1 in mallard ducks is
essential to protecting both human and animal health.

Wild waterfowl are the natural reservoir of all influenza A viruses,
and these viruses are usually nonpathogenic in these birds. However,
since late 2002, H5N1 outbreaks in Asia have resulted in mortality
among waterfowl in recreational parks, domestic flocks, and wild
migratory birds. The evolutionary stasis between influenza virus and
its natural host may have been disrupted, prompting us to ask whether
waterfowl are resistant to H5N1 influenza virus disease and whether
they can still act as a reservoir for these viruses.

To better understand the biology of H5N1 viruses in ducks and attempt
to answer this question, we inoculated juvenile mallards with 23
different H5N1 influenza viruses isolated in Asia between 2003 and
2004. All virus isolates replicated efficiently in inoculated ducks,
and 22 were transmitted to susceptible contacts. Viruses replicated
to higher levels in the trachea than in the cloaca of both inoculated
and contact birds, suggesting that the digestive tract is not the
main site of H5N1 influenza virus replication in ducks and that the
fecal-oral route may no longer be the main transmission path. The
virus isolates' pathogenicities varied from completely nonpathogenic
to highly lethal and were positively correlated with tracheal virus
titers.

Nevertheless, the 8 virus isolates that were nonpathogenic in ducks
replicated and transmitted efficiently to naive contacts, suggesting
that highly pathogenic H5N1 viruses causing minimal signs of disease
in ducks can propagate silently and efficiently among domestic and
wild ducks in Asia and that they represent a serious threat to human
and veterinary public health.
