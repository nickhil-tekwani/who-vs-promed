Viral Disease Kills 72 in Nepal, 7 Mar 1999
A so-far unidentified viral disease has killed at least 72 people, mostly
young children, in a remote mountainous village in Nepal in just two days,
a health official said on Sunday.
The village of Mahabaipatankhola, where the deaths occurred, is located in
a western mountainous area 250 miles west of the capital Katmandu and
accessible only by foot, said Mahendra Bista, chief of Nepal's Epidemiology
and Disease Control Dept. There is only one small clinic with one doctor.
Bista said the government was putting together a team of medical experts to
trek to the area. He said the virus had not been identified, but the cause
of the disease could be polluted water and/or contaminated food.
Few other details were immediately available.

An outbreak of viral influenza has claimed 90 lives and affected 3,170
others in different parts of the country in the past month, the Kathmandu
Post said Monday, quoting health ministry officials. The daily said 72
persons have died in Jumla district, mid-western Nepal, 14 in neighboring
Dolpa district and 4 in Gorkha district of western Nepal.
The symptoms included fever, cough, vomiting, headache, body ache and
cramps, and most of the victims were children aged between 5 and 15, the
newspaper said. The government was preparing to send a team of experts to
the affected areas soon, it added.

[It is interesting how a viral influenza in one report becomes an
unidentified disease in another -- or is it vice versa? We assume the 72
cases are the same in both reports. - Mod.JW]
