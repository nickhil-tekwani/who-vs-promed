>From what I can tell looking back at the recent New York State surveillance
reports, i.e., since the Griffin Lab closed in Albany, the protocol for
testing mosquito pools has been only PCR, but perhaps I am mistaken. I
think this points out one potential problem associated with using RT-PCR as
the sole method of virus detection in surveillance programs, without cell
culture assay. The only positives that will be detected are those for which
the laboratory is looking and for which the laboratory has included
primers, and all other viruses will be missed. On the other hand, in
epidemic situations, RT-PCR is highly appropriate because of its
sensitivity and speed.

[The Griffin Laboratory has not closed, but has lost most of itÂ´s staff
through attrition, so it is true that virus detection in mosquitoes is
limited to eastern equine encephlaitis and California serogroup viruses by
PCR, and SLE would be missed. However, the NY City Health Department
appears to be dealing directly with CDC and the State Health Department may
not have received any human or mosquito specimens from this outbreak.
It is conceivable that pools of mosquitoes, collected for surveillance
purposes and containing St. Louis encephalitis virus, might have been
tested this past summer and the virus not detected. This should not be
taken as criticism because laboratories usually, and reasonably, test for
the viruses one expects to see, and SLE virus was obviously not one of them
in NY.
In 1983, while I was in the best virus diagnostic laboratory I have ever
seen, at the University of Turku, Turku, Finland, we used antigen detection
assays to test for the presence of various expected viruses in a hospital
setting. At that time polioviruses had been eradicated from Finland for
some years and specimens were not tested for these viruses. Nonetheless,
a cluster of poliomyelitis cases occurred and was not detected for some
days.
Still, Laura is correct. Virus isolation tests for all viruses that
replicate in the detection system, not just those viruses for which primers
are used in sensitive PCR assays. The point of surveillance is to provide
an early warning system. Obviously, this was not the case in New York this
year. - Mods.JW/CHC
