The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health is
investigating a suspected fatal case of scarlet fever involving a 5
year old boy. The boy presented with fever from 15 Jun 2011. He was
admitted to Princess Margaret Hospital on 19 Jun 2011 after sudden
deterioration in his condition. The boy developed toxic shock syndrome
and passed away today (21 Jun 2011). According to his parent, the
child had consulted a general practitioner for chickenpox earlier. The
patient's clinical diagnosis was scarlet fever and toxic shock
syndrome. A laboratory test on his blood specimen revealed Gram
positive cocci. Further tests are being conducted by the hospital to
confirm diagnosis.

The Public Health Laboratory Centre under the CHP will also carry out
tests on any positive isolate obtained. Further investigation is
ongoing to collect more complete clinical information from the parents
and doctors who have seen the child.

The kindergarten that the boy attended, SA Tin Ka Ping Kindergarten
in Sha Tin, had no other scarlet fever cases, but an ongoing
chickenpox outbreak since 4 May 2011 has affected 11 other students
aged between 3 and 5. As a precautionary measure, the CHP advised the
kindergarten to suspend classes for 7 days starting tomorrow (22 Jun
2011). "The CHP paid a visit to the kindergarten and advised its staff
to conduct thorough cleansing and disinfection in the campus," a
spokesman for the CHP said.

Starting today [21 Jun 2011], the CHP will provide a daily update on
the scarlet fever situation online. "A new radio API on scarlet fever
is in the pipeline and is expected to roll out next week to strengthen
public education," the spokesman said. The spokesman stressed that
scarlet fever is caused by Group A _Streptococcus_ bacteria and can be
cured with appropriate antibiotics. The disease usually affects
children under 10 years of age and presents as fever, sore throat, and
rash. He urged people who are suspected to have scarlet fever to
consult their doctors.

"Members of the public should maintain vigilance against scarlet
fever as the number of reported cases remains at a high level," the
spokesman said. To prevent infection, members of the public are
advised to maintain good personal and environmental hygiene; keep
hands clean and wash hands properly, especially after they are dirtied
by respiratory secretions; cover the nose and mouth while sneezing or
coughing; dispose of nasal and mouth discharge properly; and maintain
good ventilation.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Rates of scarlet fever in Hong Kong had declined considerably since
the 1970s, but have been increasing during the past decade. Only 6
fatal cases were recorded during 1946 to 2006, the last in 1970. As
seen in the following graph, scarlet fever rates in Macau have
paralleled those of Hong Kong. [1-3]

Hong Kong has declared an outbreak of scarlet fever, an illness
potentially fatal among children, after hundreds were infected in the
teeming city the government said yesterday [21 Jun 2011]. Macau's
Health Bureau (SSM) also confirmed a notable increase in the number of
cases and said it is closely monitoring the situation.

Authorities in the neighbouring special administrative region [Hong
Kong] closed a kindergarten for a week yesterday [21 Jun 2011] after
initial tests showed that a 2nd child may have died of scarlet fever.
The 5 year old boy, who died yesterday morning, went to a kindergarten
with 400 other children. While authorities have not detected any other
scarlet fever cases at the school, it was advised to close for a week.
"We will be monitoring the situation very closely," Thomas Tsang, a
medical doctor and controller of Hong Kong's Centre for Health
Protection (CHP), told a news conference.

Experts meanwhile warned that the epidemic sweeping through Hong
Kong, Macau, and parts of China may worsen. "The situation is rather
serious at the moment," Tsang added. "We are facing an epidemic
because the bacterium that is causing scarlet fever is widely
circulating in this region -- not only in Hong Kong but in mainland
China and Macau." In a statement released late yesterday [21 Jun
2011], the SSM said Macau has reported a notable increase in the
number of scarlet fever cases in recent months when compared to the
same period of last year [2010].

As of yesterday [21 Jun 2011], a total of 49 people were diagnosed
with scarlet fever this year [?in Macau], a surge from 29 and 16
cases, respectively, in 2009 and 2010. In May alone, the highest
number of 16 cases was reported. [Most of the infections were mild.]

The bureau [? Macau's Health Bureau or SSM] said 7 boys and 2 girls
were hospitalised for treatment, but no deaths have been reported so
far.

Children under 10 made up 93 per cent of the reported cases in Hong
Kong and most of the infections were mild. In Macau, among the 49
patients, 35 were boys and 14 were girls, and 53 per cent of them aged
between 5 and 8, and another 41 per cent between 2 and 4 years old.
Authorities urged parents and schools to keep a close eye on their
children and students and to report any suspicious cases.

Hong Kong authorities have recorded 40 new cases in the past few
days, pushing the total number to 459 so far this year [2011], the
highest annual total in the city and more than 3 times the figure for
the whole of 2010. "We have seen an unusually high number of cases
this year," the spokesman said, describing the situation as an
"outbreak". Scientists said the outbreak may be linked to a deadly new
strain of the disease, which could make it more contagious than in the
past. A unique gene fragment was present in the bacteria's genome
"which might contribute to increased transmissibility of this strain,"
said Hong Kong's CHP statement, released late Monday [20 Jun 2011].
The new strain, discovered by researchers at the University of Hong
Kong, appears to be resistant to antibiotics traditionally used to
fight the illness, the spokesman added.

[The new information concerning the scarlet fever outbreak in Hong
Kong and neighboring regions presented in the news releases above is
that the total number of cases in Macau is 49 so far this year (2011)
and the number of cases in Hong Kong has risen from 419 to 459.
However, we still do not have any further information on the extent of
the outbreak in neighboring China, other than about "9000 cases" had
occurred there (personal communication, Mary Ann Benitez) from
yesterday's ProMED-mail post (Streptococcus, group A, scarlet fever,
fatal - China: (HK) RFI 20110622.1906). Updated information on the
epidemiology of the outbreak in the affected regions and the
characteristics of the strains of _Streptococcus pyogenes_ involved
would be useful and most appreciated.
