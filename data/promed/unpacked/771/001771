[While attention has been focused on the 2019-nCoV (2019 novel coronavirus) activity in China and elsewhere, MERS-CoV transmission has continued in Saudi Arabia. During the month of January 2020 through today (23 Jan 2020), there have been a total of 7 newly confirmed cases reported. Cases have come from Riyadh (3), Asir (2), Al Madinah (1), and Al Qasim. 5 of the 7 reported cases were classified as primary cases with only 1 of the 5 reporting contact with camels prior to onset of illness. Outcomes were known for 4 of the cases -- 1 fatality and 3 recoveries.

Curiously, 2 of the cases were in healthcare personnel from Asir region (one reported to be 83 years of age). Presumably, they had contact with an infected patient, although the most recent case reported in Asir region has date of confirmation on 12 Dec 2019, over 4 weeks preceding the onset of illness of these cases. More information on the epidemiologic investigation surrounding these 2 cases would be greatly appreciated.
