The health authorities are struggling to contain a hepatitis epidemic in Ustí nad Labem, north of Prague. Doctors report 30 new cases in the last 6 days alone. Altogether 276 people have contracted the infectious disease in different parts of the city. Of the 30 new cases, 17 are children. Vaccinations are underway in schools and the locals have been asked to take precautions when visiting crowded places, such as supermarkets and public transport. Doctors say it may take up to 2 months to contain the epidemic.

[An outbreak like this is likely food or waterborne and implementation of a vaccine strongly suggests that hepatitis A is the cause.

Ústí nad Labem is the 7th-most populous city of the Czech Republic. It is the capital of its eponymous region and district. Ústí is situated in a mountainous district at the confluence of the Bílina and Elbe rivers. It is a major industrial center and, besides being an active river port, is an important railway junction. The name of Ústí nad Labem is formed from the Old Czech ustie ("river mouth") and Labe (the River Elbe). It thus literally means "Mouth-upon-the-Elbe", in reference to its location at the Bilina's confluence with the Elbe. It is popularly known as Ústí for short. The Czech name was Latinized as Usk super Albium and Germanized as Aussig or Außig. Prior to Czechoslovak independence amid the dissolution of Austria-Hungary following the First World War, the town was usually known in English as Aussig, but sometimes also referred to as Aussyenad, Labem, or Oustí nad Labem.(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%9Ast%C3%AD_nad_Labem) - Mod.LL
