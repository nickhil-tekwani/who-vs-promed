Panel Makes Smallpox Recommendation
-------------------
ATLANTA (AP) -- A government advisory panel rejected smallpox vaccinations
for the general public Thursday, instead proposing that the shots be given
to special teams of people in each state who would be designated the first
to respond in case of a bioterrorism attack.
The recommendation by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices,
which sets U.S. vaccine policy, came after two days of hearings on the
threat of a smallpox attack versus the dangerous side effects of the vaccine.
The recommendation is subject to approval by the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention and Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy Thompson.
Currently, smallpox vaccinations are given only to scientists who handle
the virus. But federal health officials asked the panel to reconsider after
Sept. 11 and the anthrax-by-mail attacks.
Under the plan proposed Thursday, states would designate smallpox response
teams -- probably including doctors, disease detectives, nurses, lab
workers and law enforcement officers -- who would be first to investigate a
suspected terrorist release of the virus. These teams would be vaccinated
against the deadly virus.
States would also be allowed to vaccinate staff at pre-designated hospitals
where patients with confirmed cases of smallpox would be treated.
The government estimates the number of people vaccinated under the plan
would be in the thousands.
Vaccinating every American against the virus without a credible threat of
its widespread release was judged too risky.
The vaccine can cause severe rashes, brain swelling and death, particularly
in people with skin disorders and or the AIDS viruse. About 300 people
would die from side effects if the whole nation were vaccinated, experts
have said.

[There was a webcast press conference from 4 - 5 PM EST on the CDC website
following the release of the ACIP recommendations today. At this time
there were extensive discussions surrounding the decision and the concerns
raised that a widespread vaccination at this time was not prudent when one
evaluated the risk of such a policy versus the risk of actual smallpox
infection. For those readers who are interested in listening to the
webcast it is still available
