An outbreak of virulent avian influenza (AI) occurred in three properties
near Tamworth, New South Wales (NSW) during November/December 1997.
Outbreak description
An increase in daily mortality was first noticed in one shed of a
broiler-breeder operation on 16 November and thought to be due to a
bacterial infection. However, after increased mortalities in other sheds
from 21 to 24 November, avian influenza (AI) was suspected. This was
confirmed by viral isolation at the Australian Animal Health Laboratory
(AAHL) on 25 November. The mortality rate in affected sheds ranged from
about 40 to 100% over about seven days.
A second infected broiler breeder enterprise was situated about 3 km south
of the first infected flock. Following confirmation of AI on the first
property, and identification of a potential link through a dead bird
pick-up contractor, the second property was placed under a high level of
surveillance. On 3 December 1997, daily mortality in one shed increased
from 2 to 22. Gross pathology observed at post mortem examination was
suggestive of AI, a diagnosis confirmed by testing at AAHL.
Infection was also confirmed in emu chicks, located on a property about 1
km to the south-east of the first case. There were 261 emu chicks present,
ranging from one to three months old. This property also had a broiler
growing enterprise, although the broiler sheds were empty at the time o
the outbreak. AI virus was isolated from cloacal swabs collected from the
emu chicks as part of routine surveillance activities on 5 December. At no
time was there any evidence of clinical disease in any of these emus.
Adult emus on a related property about 20 km away were serologically
negative for AI virus.
AI virus serotype H7N4 was isolated from all three cases. Extensive
investigation and surveillance was undertaken on both commercial and
residential poultry flocks in the area, without detecting any additional
infected flocks.
Response
Following the confirmation of virulent AI, Commonwealth and State Chief
Veterinary Officers agreed that an eradication program would be implemented
in accordance with the Australian Veterinary Emergency Plan (AUSVETPLAN).
NSW Agriculture coordinated operations with the assistance of Rural Lands
Protection Boards and local emergency operations organisations. A local
disease control centre was established at Tamworth to coordinate operations
in the area, and a State disease control centre was established in Orange
to coordinate policy, resources and finances. More than 100 people operated
from the local centre at the peak of the campaign, with a further 1012 in
the State control centre. As specified in the AUSVETPLAN guidelines, action
commenced immediately to prevent the spread of the disease, eliminate
infection on infected properties, and undertake surveillance to detect any
additional cases.
At the start of the outbreak, a 3-km restricted zone and a 10-km control
zone were declared around the outbreak area, to allow strict controls on
the movement of poultry and poultry products. All commercial poultry flocks
within these areas were closely monitored for evidence of disease,
including regular post mortem examination of dead birds, and serology for
evidence of AI antibodies. Domestic backyard poultry in the restricted zone
were also checked for evidence of AI virus.
All birds on infected premises were destroyed and buried, litter was
removed and buried, and sheds were thoroughly cleaned and disinfected. The
last of the infected birds were slaughtered on 13 December, and
decontamination operations continued until early January 1998. After
completion of cleaning and disinfection, sheds were left empty for a
further three weeks before restocking. Surveillance will continue on the
restocked farms for a further six months to ensure that the virus has been
successfully eliminated. Area movement restrictions were revoked on all but
the three previously infected properties in late January.
During the outbreak, a total of about 310 000 broiler breeders and progeny,
1.2 million fertile chicken eggs, 261 emus and 147 emu eggs were destroyed.
All direct costs of eradication will be met under the CommonwealthStates
Cost Sharing Agreement for eradication of certain exotic diseases. Under
this agreement, the Commonwealth Government and State/Territory governments
meet the cost of eradication for any of 12 specified exotic diseases,
including virulent avian influenza. This agreement covers the cost of
compensation to the owner for stock and equipment destroyed as part of the
eradication program, as well as operational costs for the program.
Suspected Source and Epidemiology
Extensive tracing and investigation identified contaminated river-water as
the most likely source for infection on the first property. All water for
the enterprise is pumped from the Peel River, and filtered and chlorinated
before use. Investigations suggest that filtration and chlorination of the
water was inadequate, potentially permitting the persistence of AI virus in
the water. A survey of wild bird in the area upstream of the water intake
identified a number of water bird species that could present a high risk
source for AI.
Spread of the virus to the second property appears to have been due to
either mechanical transfer by the dead bird pick-up truck, or possibly by
aerosol transmission. Spread to the third property was probably via aerosol
or flies.
Extensive investigations on all infected properties, and surveillance of
both commercial and backyard poultry failed to identify any other infected
flocks or any other likely sources of infection for the three infected flocks.
