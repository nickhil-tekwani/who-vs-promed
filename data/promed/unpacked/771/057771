Indonesia: Some Background Information on the Suspected 4th Victim
-----------------------------------------------
An Indonesian woman is almost certainly the 1st known avian influenza
fatality in densely populated [central] Jakarta, but authorities are
rejecting World Health Organization (WHO) warnings of a potential pandemic
and reneging on ordering a cull of chickens. The death of the 37-year-old,
4 days after being diagnosed with bird flu symptoms, follows 3 fatalities
in provincial Tangerang, west of the capital.
Health Minister Siti Fadila Supari yesterday [11 Sep 2005] said there was
no chance of human-to-human transmission, but later admitted she did not
know how the woman contracted the disease. The woman was an immigration
agent and dealt with many expatriates. Inquiries so far had found that
people she had contact with were healthy, Mrs Siti said. Unlike most bird
flu victims, she rarely had contact with animals, but reportedly lived near
a chicken slaughterhouse.
The senior WHO official dealing with the disease in Indonesia, Steven
Bjorge, said the H5N1 virus was endemic across Indonesia's chicken
population. This greatly increased the chance of mutation into a disease
that could spread from human to human. Dr. Bjorge said a pandemic killing
millions was "an inevitability, whether it's here, next year or 10 years
from now can't be predicted. Throughout all parts of Asia, concern is
rising that the H5N1 virus could be the one that becomes the pandemic
virus." At this point, the virus was not easily infecting humans, he said.
"Millions and millions of birds have been infected and died; a relatively
small number of humans have been infected. You have to expect there are
going to be more (human) cases, because the virus is clearly endemic in the
(Indonesian) bird population." Dr. Bjorge said he was "really skeptical
about the ability to implement mass culling or even mass vaccination in
this current scenario of Indonesia." Instead, better bio-security,
including improved hygiene and species segregation, was essential.
Mrs. Siti yesterday [11 Sep 2005] ducked questions on whether she would
initiate a cull of all chickens within 3 km of the latest infection, as
required under WHO guidelines. "I am not a chicken slaughterer," she said.
An official from the directorate of livestock also refused to answer the
question, but said the move would cost millions. After the 1st 3 deaths in
July 2005, authorities said they did not have the funds to cull nearby
chickens and pigs. Only 71 animals were slaughtered.
Mrs. Siti said investigators were examining the latest victim's movements
and contacts. "It is extremely likely she has contracted avian influenza,"
she said. Although the source of the virus could not be confirmed, Mrs.
Siti urged people not to panic, because "avian influenza cannot pass
between humans." The latest case [if confirmed] will take the Asian bird
flu death toll to 63 since the virus emerged in 2003.
The estimated number of chickens killed by avian influenza in Indonesia is
9.5 million, whereas the number of animals culled this year [2005] is 71.
The numbers of human avian influenza virus cases reported in East Asia
since 23 Dec 2003 are thus: Cambodia - 4 cases and 4 deaths, Indonesia - 4
cases and 4 deaths (including the current suspected case); Thailand - 17
cases and 12 deaths; and Viet Nam - 90 cases and 40 deaths.

[It remains unclear how any of the 4 Indonesian avian influenza virus cases
contracted infection. It should be noted that the numbers of cases and
fatalities in East Asia quoted at the end of this article agree with the
WHO cumulative totals of laboratory confirmed cases, except for the figures
relating to Indonesia. WHO still acknowledges only a single case and a
single death from avian influenza virus infection in Indonesia, and neither
the Indonesian authorities nor WHO cite the previously reported single
confirmed asymptomatic case of avian influenza virus infection. - Mod.CP]
