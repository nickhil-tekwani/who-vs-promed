Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comment: rabbit calicivirus has been used in Australia as a biological control agent since 1995. In Australia, RHDV2 was first detected in European rabbits in the Australian Capital Territory in May 2015 (immediate notification sent to the OIE on 7 Jul 2015 [Note: published in ProMED-mail posting 20150708.3494836.- Mod.CRD]) and has since spread to New South Wales, Victoria, Northern Territory, Tasmania, and South Australia. Routine testing of 3 dead wild European hares, 2 in South Australia, and one in Victoria, found rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus 2 (RHDV2). RHDV2 has not previously been detected in European hares (_Lepus europaeus_).

Control measures
Measures applied: vaccination permitted (if a vaccine exists); no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures
