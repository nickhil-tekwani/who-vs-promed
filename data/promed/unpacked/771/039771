[Low level continued transmission of the MERS-CoV continues in Saudi Arabia. In the past 3 days there have been 4 newly confirmed cases reported from Saudi Arabia with one being an asymptomatic household contact of one of the Wadi Aldawasir cases. The remaining 3 cases involved 2 individuals with histories of direct contact with camels in the 14 days preceding onset of their illness, and a 3rd individual whose high risk exposure history was still under investigation. Since the beginning of April 2017, there have been a total of 15 newly confirmed cases reported by Saudi Arabia on the MOH MERS-CoV website.

Since [Sun 5 Mar 2017], there have been 15 laboratory confirmed infections with MERS-CoV reported by Saudi Arabia, associated with an outbreak in a renal dialysis unit. Seven of the 15 infections were in individuals who were asymptomatic and were identified through contact screening - 3 were secondary healthcare acquired infections in healthcare workers and 4 were secondary cases in household contacts.
In Moon SY, Son JS. Infectivity of an Asymptomatic Patient With Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Infection. Clin Infect Dis. 2017 Apr 22. doi:10.1093/cid/cix170. [Epub ahead of print], there was one asymptomatic MERS-CoV infected individual with 82 contacts identified, none of whom were found to be MERS-CoV infected leading the authors to conclude that asymptomatic infections with MERS-CoV were not significant players in the continued transmission of the virus.

* Case was detected through contact tracing of a previous MERS-CoV case.

Between [18 Mar and 20 Apr 2017], 13 cases of MERS were reported in Saudi Arabia. Six of these cases had exposure to infected dromedary camels or consumed their raw milk, which is the most likely source of their infection and 2 cases were detected through contact tracing of previously reported MERS-CoV cases. Investigation into the history of exposure to the known risk factors in the 14 days prior to onset of symptoms is ongoing for the remaining cases. Contact tracing of household and healthcare contacts is ongoing for all 13 cases.

On [Tue 18 Apr 2017], one case of MERS was reported in Qatar. The 25-year-old case has a history of frequent contact with dromedary camels and no history of exposure to other known risk factors in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms. He is currently in stable condition admitted to a negative pressure isolation room on a ward. The department of health protection and communicable disease control in the Ministry of Public Health has carried out case investigation and contact tracing. All contacts have tested negative but will continue to be monitored until the end of the monitoring period of 14 days of last exposure to the case.

To date, Qatar has reported 20 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS. The last case was reported on [Tue 21 Mar 2017] (see Disease Outbreak News published on [Tue 4 Apr 2017]).

Globally, since September 2012, WHO has been notified of 1952 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV including at least 693 related deaths have been reported.

[As mentioned above, there have been a total of 20 cases of MERS-CoV reported by Qatar since the identification of the virus in 2012. This newly confirmed case represents the 2nd case reported by Qatar this year (2017).

With respect to Saudi Arabia, the above WHO report provides more details on a fatality reported in Wadi Aldawasir on [Wed 19 Apr 2017] for whom an initial laboratory confirmation report was not available on the Saudi MOH MERS-CoV website. In addition, case no 12 was not reported as a newly confirmed case on the Saudi MOH MERS website, but was reported as a recovery on [Fri 7 Apr 2017]. Of the 13 cases contained in the above report, 3 resulted in fatalities (cases no. 2, 5 and 13). There was an additional newly confirmed infection reported by the MOH that is not on the above list - a report on [Wed 29 Mar 2017] of a 93-year-old Saudi female who was reported as a recovery on [Mon 3 Apr 2017].
