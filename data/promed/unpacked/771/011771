[1] Africa (Somalia, Jubaland State): response to measles outbreak
Date: Sun 9 Aug 2020

The health system of any country needs a surveillance system that can collect information on and detect alerts of epidemic-prone diseases. When a number of cases threatens to turn into an outbreak or epidemic, the surveillance system sounds an alarm that triggers a chain of immediate public health interventions.

Somalia's Early Warning and Alert Network (EWARN) is again proving its value as a real-time early warning disease alert system, as in June 2020, WHO was alerted to a possible measles outbreak in a camp for internally displaced people (IDPs) in Jubaland State and shared this information with the State Ministry of Health. On initial investigation, Somalia's EWARN system reported 11 cases of children with rashes and high-grade fever, typical symptoms of measles, in Kismayo.

Initial phase of outbreak response rolled out following field investigation
--------------------------------------
As soon as the alert was shared, a team from the WHO Somalia country office, the Ministry of Health in Kismayo, and Health Cluster* partners took swift action to further verify and investigate the alert, confirm the diagnosis and develop an effective response plan in the event that the alert turned out to be a "true" outbreak.

Between 18 and 25 Jul 2020, a WHO team was deployed in Kismayo. Together with the Ministry of Health of Jubaland State and a local health partner, field investigations were carried out in the Dalhiiska IDP camp, Warshada Hargaha IDP camp, Farjano, Gulwada, Shaqalah sections, Kismayo General Hospital, and a number of health facilities. The field investigations, led by WHO, identified a total of 400 suspected cases of measles reported from the Jubaland State that met the case definition of measles. Most of the infected children were under-5 years of age from the camps with no history of vaccination against measles. These cases were reported from June to the end of July this year. A total of 7 samples collected from the suspected cases tested positive for measles at the Central Public Health Laboratory in Mogadishu. The tests were conducted using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).

Once the outbreak was laboratory-confirmed, a response plan was drawn up. As part of this plan, the Kismayo General Hospital, one of the largest health facilities in the state of Jubaland, introduced a new isolation centre offering 20 beds for measles patients. Concurrently, WHO and Health Cluster partners provided support to strengthen case management for each patient and helped manage the collection and testing of samples from children with symptoms. They retrained health workers on the use of case definitions and to record data using a standardized line-list in order to better understand the size of the outbreak and its geographic extent. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Health in Jubaland convened a meeting with all key partners, including the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and WHO, to ensure all outbreak response efforts were coordinated.

Unvaccinated children due to 'drop-outs'
-------------------------------
Kismayo has been an epicentre for outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases, such as measles, in the past for a variety of reasons.

"Host to a large population of internally displaced people from neighbouring, insecure regions where access to health care is limited, we knew there could be many unvaccinated children in Kismayo and other districts. We need to boost immunization among these unvaccinated children from vulnerable and underserved families so that they remain safe," said Mukhtar Abdi, Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) Manager for the Federal Government of Somalia.

Other key challenges faced in the state include a large number of drop-outs or children who have not received all the vaccinations they require, among host communities and IDPs, coupled with limited routine immunization due to inaccessibility and presumably lack of demand for vaccines.

The recent concern of WHO and other international agencies on the significant drop in routine immunization, against diseases like measles, among vulnerable communities during the pandemic continues to be a cause for concern, as outbreaks of measles and other vaccine-preventable diseases will continue to occur and recur if swift and timely action is not taken to address the steady drop in routine immunization.

*Somalia's Health Cluster is a network of national and international organizations working in the health sector across the country, under the leadership of WHO Somalia.

Note: GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance, provides support to the EPI programme in Somalia, run jointly by WHO and Somalia's health authorities.

[2] Somalia: COVID-19, decreased routine vaccinations
Date: Wed 29 Jul 2020

[Families] are afraid of contracting COVID-19 from health facilities, which has resulted in a low uptake of regular health services.

Unfortunately, if caregivers stop visiting health facilities to seek regular health services, children will bear the consequences of these decisions. A joint analysis of WHO and UNICEF country offices shows that by the end of June 2020, an estimated 108 000 children under one year of age in Somalia might have missed out on their 1st dose of measles vaccines, and close to 96 000 might have missed out on their 3rd doses of pentavalent vaccines [5-in-1 vaccine; in the UK: diphtheria, whooping cough (pertussis), tetanus, hepatitis B, and Hib disease (_Haemophilus influenzae_ type b). The polio vaccine is then usually given separately as a live oral vaccine. In the US, diphtheria, tetanus toxoids, and acellular pertussis (DTaP), recombinant hepatitis B (HepB), and inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) are available.] In the long term, this could translate to children living compromised lives, with low immunity, and become more prone to catching and spreading infectious diseases. This can pose a threat to the country, region, and world.

Plummeting routine immunization rates in children
In 2020, Somalia set a target of 620 000 children aged under one year for routine immunization to receive vaccines against childhood tuberculosis, polio, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, hepatitis B, _Haemophilus influenza_ type B, and measles. This means around 55 000 children under one year of age should be vaccinated each month. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Somalia has witnessed a drop in immunization, both in outreach by health service providers and uptake by parents/caregivers. Vaccination coverage for pentavalent 1, for instance, has decreased by 10% from January to June 2020, compared to the same period in 2019.

Data gathered by the WHO and UNICEF country offices show that immunization rates plummeted from January to May 2020, rising slightly again in June, possibly due to lockdowns being eased and people being able to move more freely.

In 2020, the Federal Government of Somalia was forced to postpone all planned, regular large-scale health campaigns that aimed to offer eligible children measles and polio vaccines, vitamin A supplements and deworming tablets in their homes. This included 2 rounds of polio campaigns aimed at stopping the spread of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV2), by reaching around 1.6 million children under the age of 5 in the southern and central regions of Somalia, and an integrated measles-polio campaign in Banadir, targeting around 300 000 children to protect them from measles and the paralyzing effects of polio.

In a country already living with threats such as the locust invasion, recurring extremes of drought and floods, and insecurity in some states, the health system across Somalia is still fragile and health resources are limited.

If regular immunization is not continued and stepped up in the coming months, Somalia stands a high chance of reversing some of the health gains made in child health in the last few decades. The country risks witnessing outbreaks of vaccine preventable diseases, with additional children prone to contracting diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, measles, and circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses.

To avoid this situation, Dr Mamunur Malik, WHO Representative in Somalia, reaffirmed WHO's commitment to redouble efforts to protect children from these vaccine-preventable diseases.

[3] India: vaccine disruption due to COVID-19, comment
Date: Mon 10 Aug 2020
Source: Huffington Post [abridged, edited]
https://www.huffingtonpost.in/entry/india-coronavirus-disrupts-immunisation-programme_ in_ 5f2d2cb3c5b6e96a22b14167


When 24-year-old AB walked to the health sub centre in south Choto-Rakkhaskhali, an island in the Sundarbans, for a booster dose of the diphtheria vaccination for her 16-month-old daughter, she found the sub-centre was closed.

"I was told by the Asha workers that due to an outbreak near the sub-centre, vaccination is postponed," Bera said.

Four people in the village had contracted the novel coronavirus, prompting a closure of the sole public health facility on the island, and the suspension of the immunisation programme for infants. (Asha workers, or Accredited Social Health Activists, are a vital part of rural India's public health system.)

AB's experience is far from unique. Across the world, the novel coronavirus pandemic and the consequent lockdowns, have disrupted national immunisation programmes putting an estimated 80 million children in 68 countries at risk of contracting diphtheria, polio, and measles according to WHO and UNICEF.

In India, Priti Mahara, Director, Policy Research and Advocacy, Child Rights and You (CRY), said India's immunisation programme had suffered a massive setback since March this year [2020]. "A whopping 63% of the surveyed households in the northern states reported the lack of access to immunisation services, followed by West with 39 per cent; while less than 1/3rd of the respondents reported inaccessibility to immunisation from other regions," Mahara said, adding that CRY's survey found that one in 4 respondents said healthcare for children was inaccessible during the lockdown.

"Most of it was reported from the North (31%), followed by the South (21%). In other regions, lack of access to regular healthcare facilities was experienced by less than 20% of the parents," Mahara said.

In India, interviews with parents, health workers, government officers, and public health experts in West Bengal, Delhi, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, reveal that the COVID-related disruptions to the country's immunisation and vaccination programmes have created a real risk of a measles outbreak, suggesting a nightmare scenario of overburdened public health systems trying to cope with simultaneous outbreaks of measles and COVID-19.

"Sadly, we are trying to combat a virus which does not have a vaccine while we are unable to pay adequate attention to ailments with known vaccines in this difficult situation," said Dr Kaninika Mitra, Health Specialist for UNICEF in West Bengal.

Children who do not get their measles-rubella vaccine on time might develop weaker immunity to the disease than their peers who get the immunised on time.

[India clearly is not alone with vaccination suspension due to COVID-19. While measles and other infectious viruses, especially those spread by the respiratory route, may be down while children are isolated at home and not at school, it does not bode well once schools reopen and both SARS-CoV-2 and measles are being transmitted to non-immune individuals. It's a very difficult and unfortunate situation. - Mod.LK]

-----------------------------------
Many countries with confirmed COVID-19 cases initiated lockdown as a response to the pandemic, with implementation of strict social distancing, isolation, and quarantine. This will likely reduce community transmission of many vaccine preventable diseases [VPDs]. But lockdown will also present a huge challenge for general practitioners (GPs) and community healthcare to deliver immunisations to 2020 birth cohorts, initiate catch-up campaigns with older cohorts, and deliver immunisations to at-risk groups. Household isolation and COVID-19 illness in families with newborn children, combined with disruption to vaccine supply, healthcare staffing shortages, and enhanced infection prevention procedures, are likely to significantly reduce opportunities for timely delivery of routine immunisations.

Uptake of vaccines in Europe has continued to decline in recent years, including in the United Kingdom (UK) [2]. The fall in MMR [measles, mumps, rubella] vaccine coverage has been followed by large outbreaks of measles, with more than 500 000 confirmed cases globally in 2019, more than in any single year since 2006 [3,4]. While spring and summer 2020 are anticipated to be accompanied by a lower incidence of many VPDs, possible further declines in routine vaccine uptake in 2020 birth cohorts may surpass recent years, and thus generate a record number of susceptible children. If lockdown ends, social distancing relaxes, and formal schooling returns before, or during the 2020/21 autumn and winter season, then outbreaks of diseases such as measles, pertussis, and rotavirus gastroenteritis appear inevitable.

While governments, healthcare professionals, and researchers are rightly focusing on the immediate response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we must ensure that sufficient resource and consideration is given to delivery of routine vaccinations. This has been highlighted in the UK by National Health Service England and Public Health England, who have recommended GP practices continue with routine immunisation services without delays [5]. This is clearly the appropriate public health approach, but the practicalities of delivering immunisations under the strain of the COVID-19 outbreak will inevitably lead to unintended drops in vaccine coverage.

In order to rapidly identify hotspots of falling uptake, immunisation rates should be monitored by analysts at the macro- (administrative area) and micro- (GP or neighbourhood level) level. The latter is critical since we know that the most-deprived populations are disproportionately affected by both immunisation service disruption and by disease burden [6]. The UK Parliament's Knowledge Exchange Unit has created a COVID-19 Outbreak Expert Database, which is intended to enable researcher access to facilitate a rapid response to COVID-19 and its impacts.

Planning for return to pre-pandemic functionality with more relaxed restrictions on social distancing must not only consider COVID-19 transmission but also the ability of the health service to cope with more endemic infection challenges. This decision should be informed by evidence from vaccine coverage surveillance, modelling, and expert information from GPs and immunisation teams. This will help ensure coverage in infant cohorts has reached a threshold whereby the risk of VPD outbreaks is acceptably low. The world cannot afford a legacy of this pandemic to be increased disability and mortality from VPDs.
