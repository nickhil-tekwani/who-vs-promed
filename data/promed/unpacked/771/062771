2 people have died from suspected rabies, while 400 others were bitten by dogs in one week alone throughout the country.

The vaccination status of the majority of the offending dogs was not known, a weekly national disease surveillance report has revealed. According to the report compiled by the Ministry of Health and Child Welfare and various partners working in the health sector, 397 dog bites were recorded in the week ending 17 Mar 2013. Of these, only 23 were inflicted by vaccinated dogs. "The vaccination status of 374 dogs was unknown," reads part of the report.

The highest number of dog bites were in Manicaland (84) and Midlands (60). The report further says that during the same week, 2 people died of rabies.

"Two suspected rabies cases, which later turned into 2 deaths, were reported this week. The cases were reported from Mutasa and Chipinge districts in Manicaland province," reads the report.

It is the law in Zimbabwe to vaccinate dogs against rabies.

According to the government's weekly report, 4 people have died of rabies since the beginning of the year [2013], while the total number of people who have been bitten by dogs stands as 4890 to date.

The World Health Organisation seeks to eliminate rabies in the region by 2020. Other countries have since eliminated the disease, but in Zimbabwe, rabies is still a cause for concern.

Statistics from the Ministry of Health and Child Welfare show that 11 people died of rabies in 2012, and a further 17 450 people were bitten by dogs the same year.

[The latest year for OIE reports of animal rabies in Zimbabwe is 2011: Manicaland (16), Mashonaland Central (13), Mashonaland East (38), Mashonaland West (18), Masvingo (23), Matabeleland North (7), Matabeleland South (38), and Midlands (31). These reports are essentially only of farm livestock and dogs. Logically, there will be a significant secondary reservoir of cases in wildlife. Until the economy turns around in Zimbabwe, we can expect this chronic situation to persist. - Mod.MHJ
