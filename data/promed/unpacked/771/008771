Avian Influenza A(H5N1) Virus - WHO Update 15
---------------------------------------------
New human case confirmed in Thailand
-----------------------------------
Health authorities in Thailand have today announced a new
laboratory-confirmed case of human infection with avian influenza A
(H5N1) virus. The case, a 58-year-old woman, died in hospital 2 Feb
2004. This latest case brings the total of human cases in Thailand to
4, of whom 3 have died.
To date, human cases of avian influenza A (H5N1) virus infection have
been reported only in Thailand and Viet Nam. Both countries have
widespread outbreaks of the disease in poultry. The new case in
Thailand brings the total number of cases in these 2 countries to 14,
of whom 11 have died.
China announces spread of suspected H5N1 infection in poultry to
additional areas
--------------------------------------------------
WHO has been informed by Chinese authorities that outbreaks in
poultry of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza are suspected in
additional parts of the country. The new suspected poultry outbreaks
have been detected at farms in the eastern province of Zhejiang
(geese), in the southwestern province of Yunnan (chickens), in the
central province of Henan (chickens), and in Xinjiang Uygar
Autonomous Region (chickens) in northwestern China. In addition,
further suspected outbreaks have been reported in the provinces of
Hubei (chickens and ducks) and Guangdong (geese). Both provinces had
previously reported outbreaks. Samples taken from diseased birds at
all these sites are now being tested in China for the presence of the
H5N1 strain.
Altogether, confirmed or suspected outbreaks of highly pathogenic
H5N1 avian influenza have been reported on poultry farms in 10 of
China's 31 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities. The
additional areas with outbreaks in poultry, announced last week, are
Guangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Shanghai, Guangdong, and Anhui provinces. Of
these, highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza has been confirmed in
Guangxi, Hunan, and Hubei.
No cases of human H5N1 infection have been reported in China to date.
Investigation of possible human-to-human transmission
--------------------------------------------------
WHO has investigated a cluster of respiratory illness in members of a
family from Thai Binh province, Viet Nam. The cluster involves a
31-year-old man, his 2 sisters, aged 23 and 30 years, and his
28-year-old wife. Both the man and his 2 sisters have died. The wife
has fully recovered. Laboratory tests received over the weekend have
confirmed avian influenza A (H5N1) virus infection in the sisters.
Neither the man nor his wife was tested.
The family members gathered in late December 2003 to prepare for the
man's wedding on 3 Jan 2004. Both the man and one sister are reported
to have handled ducks while preparing a meal on 4 Jan 2004. However,
the investigation failed to reveal any direct contact with poultry
for the man's other sister and his wife.
In the absence of evidence of direct exposure to poultry in these 2
cases, WHO epidemiologists are considering various alternative
explanations. Both sisters are known to have provided health care for
their brother prior to his hospitalization, and would thus have had
opportunities for close exposure. Direct human-to-human transmission
following this close exposure is thus one possible explanation.
However, contact with an infected bird, or some other environmental
source of the virus, is another possible route of infection that has
not been ruled out. Outbreaks of H5N1 in poultry are widespread in
Viet Nam. Large amounts of the virus are excreted in bird droppings,
and can survive for some time in the environment. Limited
human-to-human transmission of a highly pathogenic avian influenza
virus is not entirely unexpected, as this has been documented to have
occurred on 2 occasions in the recent past (in Hong Kong in 1997 and
in the Netherlands in 2003).
Local authorities report that no other family members or wedding
guests developed an illness. No illness has been detected in members
of the community where the wedding was held, or in health staff
involved in care of these cases. WHO stresses the need to continue to
investigate each human case of H5N1 in order to identify the source
of infection.

[2] Age-related H1N1 immunity
Date: Mon 2 Feb 2004
From: Norman Noah <Norman.Noah@lshtm.ac.uk>

A Comment on H1N1 Immunity
--------------------------
When Influenza H1N1 reached England in 1977, we noticed that nearly
everyone infected with it (and confirmed by a laboratory) had been
born after 1956, when the H1N1 virus had previously disappeared,
having circulated from 1947-1956. In fact, in 3 consecutive years we
had infections with H1N1, H3N2, and then both together. Age
distributions of those affected in these years showed this very
nicely: H1N1 <25y, H3N2 the usual J-shaped curve, and both an amalgam
of the 2 distributions.
I tried to get the vaccine manufacturers interested in this, with my
thesis being that natural infection with H1N1, and possibly other
subtypes, provided a solid immunity, but they didn't take it up.
