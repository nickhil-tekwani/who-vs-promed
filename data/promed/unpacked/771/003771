SALMONELLA RODENTICIDES
=======================
Dear colleague
I found your message on use of Salmonella rodenticides in Latin America on
the web. You might be aware of the fact that the problem is much older. In
fact, Salmonella rodenticides have been widely used in Europe up to the
early 1950's despite concerns of public health officials on human health
risks posed by their use (e.g. J. Taylor, Lancet (May 5, 1956) I:630). There
even was a hypothesis that the high prevalence of S. typhimurium all over
Europe and America might be a consequence of this widespread use. However,
the typing methods available at that time to distinguish rodenticide strains
from other isolates were very limited (e.g. P.H. Leslie, J. Hyg. (1942)
42:552-562, and L. Bitter & al. Munch. Med. Wschr. (1926) I:940-941) and
therefore the evidence is rather circumstantial.
However, it is surprising how many times the same experiments have to be
repeated until the final evidence is generally accepted and the nonsense
stopped.
