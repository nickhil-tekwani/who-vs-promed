This is regarding the news about 2 children dying with "acute encephalitis syndrome" (AES) in Muzaffarpur, Bihar state, India. The diagnosis of AES includes all acute brain diseases, irrespective of actual cause; it could be encephalitis, encephalopathy, meningitis (bacterial/viral), brain involvement of scrub typhus or dengue and so on. The use of AES as diagnosis means the actual diagnosis is unknown.

Hypoglycemic encephalopathy associated with litchi has strict seasonality--2nd half of March to end of June. Outside this period it does not occur at all and this strict seasonality coincides with litchi harvesting. This means the 2 reported cases in August cannot be litchi-associated.

Moreover, there are 3 more clues: its onset of symptoms is always between 5 am and 7 am; it occurs only in undernourished children; CSF is always without increased cell count. Low blood and CSF sugar is obvious as the name suggests.

Of late, the territory of JE has expanded in Bihar and previously JE-unaffected districts like Muzaffarpur is currently JE-affected. The season of JE is late monsoon or post-monsoon, August through November.

[ProMED thanks Dr. John for his comments on these recent cases. He excludes litchis as a cause of AES in current cases. Dr. John's earlier comments identified hypoglycemic encephalopathy as the etiology of cases often referred to as acute encephalitis syndrome (AES). The article that Dr. John cited provides useful information about the occurrence of hypoglycemic encephalopathy and the mechanism involved in the pathophysiology. The reference that he cited is Sarkar et al. (Sarkar A, Datta D, Datta SK, John TJ. Acute encephalopathy in children in Muzaffarpur, India: a review of aetiopathogenesis. Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg. 2020; 114: 704-11. https://doi.org/10.1093/trstmh/traa036).

A portion of the abstract states, "...Recently, AES has been identified as hypoglycaemic encephalopathy of an unusual aetiology with 3 key factors: undernutrition, prolonged fasting and litchi consumption. A 2nd set of investigators has independently reconfirmed the diagnosis and the 3-factor aetiology. Skipping the evening meal with an intake of large amounts of litchi in undernourished children is causative. Early-morning hypoglycaemia with an inadequate glycogen store leads to initiation of gluconeogenesis and fatty acid beta-oxidation, but methylene cyclopropyl alanine and glycine present in the litchi aril block the fatty acid beta-oxidation cycle. The outcomes are uncorrected hypoglycaemia and encephalopathy due to the entry of metabolic intermediates that cross the blood-brain barrier and affect neuronal function. Suggested measures include early 10% dextrose infusion." The previous ProMED post to which Dr. John refers made no mention of hypoglycemia. One does not know if there was no hypoglycemia or if it occurred but was not mentioned. In the current cases, one wonders if hypoglycemic encephalopathy occurred without litchi consumption, resulting with health authorities recommending that children not go to bed with empty stomachs (see Japanese encephalitis & other - India (07): (BR) at http://promedmail.org/post/20210815.8596130). If Dr. John has further comments on these recent cases, his remarks would be welcome. - Mod. TY]
