In the Zaporozhye region and in the whole of Ukraine, the incidence rate of dirofilariasis -- subcutaneous transmitted helminthiasis of dogs, cats, and wild animals -- has increased in recent years. Dirofilariasis can be contracted by people as well. During the last 5 years, about 100 cases have been registered among the human population of the Zaporozhye region. Since the start of 2014, 10 patients have already been identified.

It is alarming that a large portion of all cases is of local origin, that is, patients did not live outside the region. This fact indicates the presence of foci of infection (infected animals) in Zaporojye region. Data about dirofilaria in dogs have also been recorded by the veterinary service of the Zaporozhye region. The distribution of dirofilaria in animals coincides with the geographical distribution of dirofilaria cases in humans in Berdyansk, Zaporozhye, Vasilevsky, Melitopol, Tokmak, Zaporizhzhya and Pology areas.

[Climate warming has created, during recent years, comfortable conditions for the propagation of the vector (mosquitoes) of this helminthiasis. This has led to the observed increase in the incidence rate of dirofilaria cases, expanding the range of its distribution. From 1975 to 2012, 1533 cases of dirofilariasis have been registered in Ukraine, including 1465 cases within the period 1997-2012. Dirofilariasis occurs in all regions of Ukraine.
