A farmer in Pinrang Regency, South Sulawesi [Sulawesi Selatan] has admitted to selling beef from cattle that had died from what is suspected to be anthrax. "I sold the beef way under the market price, back in February [2016]," Zainuddin, the 46-year old farmer, said on Wed 9 Mar 2016.

According to Zainuddin, he sold his cattle for Rp 1.5 million [USD 116] per animal, way below the average price in Pinrang, which averages at around Rp 7 to 8 million [USD 540-620] per animal. Worryingly, Zainuddin also said that he knew that cattle that had been infected with anthrax could cause a public health scare. "I knew the consequences of my actions," Zainuddin said.

Zainuddin's decision to sell off his anthrax-infected cattle has already come to the attention of the Director General for Animal Health and Husbandry for the Agriculture Ministry, Muladno, who found out about the case during a visit to the village of Malimpung in Pinrang Regency on Tue 8 Mar 2016.

Malimpung is one of the few villages in the area that had suffered from an anthrax outbreak, which had killed scores of local cattle. "Anthrax is highly dangerous if it cross-infects a human, so we call on local farmers to stop supplying beef for nearby markets until it can be established that their livestock is free from the disease," said Muladno. "Anthrax viruses attack human lymph nodes; it is very dangerous to humans."

The Head of Pinrang's Agency for Agriculture and Animal Husbandry, Johanis, said that his officials are coordinating with the Trade Agency to anticipate the spread of anthrax-tainted beef in the area. "In addition to stepping up our vaccination program, we routinely sample beef from local markets to see whether the anthrax virus is present or not, but to date, we have yet to find any tainted sample," Johanis said.

Scores of cattle have died in Malimpung in the past 2 weeks. As of Tue 8 Mar 2016, 31 cows and 5 oxen suddenly died from what is suspected to be anthrax, causing panic among local residents and farmers.

[There is confusion in the script, with the farmer 1st described as selling "beef," then "cattle." Logically, he was selling cow carcasses. And the implication is that this farmer's dead cows were in some way related to the recent cattle die-off in Malimpung, already suspected to be from anthrax. If any of our readers in Indonesia can sort this out for us, it would be appreciated.

Indonesia has not reported any anthrax outbreaks in 2015 and 2014, which, considering the frequency of this livestock disease in that country, more likely reflects an official report absence more than a disease absence.
