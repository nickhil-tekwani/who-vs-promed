Fuel 'crisis' hampers anthrax vaccination
-----------------------------------------
The Upper East Regional Director of Veterinary Service, Dr. Thomas Anyorikeya, says the main challenge facing the vaccination of animals in the area following the outbreak(s) of anthrax is how to fuel vehicles to move into communities.

Dr. Anyorikeya said though his outfit has presented budget to that effect only one District Assembly has responded. He therefore appealed to the other assemblies to release funds to enable them to carry out the exercise.

[If there is any consistency in the reports from Ghana it is of the repeated outbreaks of anthrax in the Upper East Region in cattle, sheep, goats and humans, even though it is one of the smallest regions in Ghana. If this disease is to be controlled, herds and flocks known to be at risk, either from previous outbreaks or from being near such herds and flocks, have to be vaccinated before new outbreaks occur. Retroactive vaccination is too late and not cost effective.

[In some other African countries, vaccines are carried by the railways and distributed from stations by couriers on bicycles or horseback. Perhaps a solution could be to ship the vaccine to Navrongo or other stations in the region for local distribution. Unfortunately, it may be too late for this season. - Mod.JW
