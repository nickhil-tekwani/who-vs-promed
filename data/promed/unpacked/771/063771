Monitoring of poultry for fowl plague
--------------------------------------
Minister Veerman of Agriculture, Nature Management and Fisheries,
has decided to start a countrywide surveillance programme,
monitoring the presence of the Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza
(Klassieke Vogelpest; HPAI) virus. Behind this decision is the
possibility that, besides the highly pathogenic virus variant, a less
pathogenic variant might also be circulating in the Netherlands.
Randomly selected samples will be collected in all provinces and
sectors. In addition, it has been decided to test all meat-producing
duck, turkey, and chicken farms which provide access to the
outdoors [for the poultry]. The total number of such farms, within
and outside the Gelders Valley, is about 1300. This mass survey will
be completed next week and will be regularly repeated for the
foreseeable future.
So far, 14 farms have been found infected and 22 seriously
suspected in the Gelders Valley. The HPAI variant is very infectious,
recognizable by swelling of the head and neck and the discoloration
of the comb and legs. Incubation is about 10 days. The disease then
proceeds swiftly, leading to death in most cases.
The low-pathogenic variant [LPAI] is much less recognizable,
demonstrating lower infectivity and mortality. The main symptom is
decreased egg laying.

Compensation for fowl-plague affected farms
----------------------------------------------
The cabinet has allocated at least 5 million Euros for farms affected
by the fowl plague [Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza]. Minister
Veerman will increase the fund when industry, local governments
and municipalities contribute their share. The number of infected
and suspected farms in the Gelders Valley has in the meantime
become 36.
Following the same policy which was adopted during the FMD crisis,
the emergency fund will support, besides the affected poultry farm,
other affected activities such as recreation and catering enterprises.
The new fund is meant only to compensate lost income, while the
costs involved in the destruction of hundreds of thousands of birds
are to be covered by the government and the European Union.
The number of infected farms is currently 11; another 25 are
suspected. All 36 farms are situated within the Gelders Valley,
where the first outbreak was discovered on Friday, 9 days ago. The
ministry's spokesperson is not worried about the new cases. "Fowl
plague can have an incubation time of 2 weeks. New foci outside the
current infected zone would be a cause for worry."
The minister has extended the ban on transportation, adding horses,
cattle, sheep and pigs to the list of animals that are not allowed to
enter or exit the poultry-farms area.
The destruction of about 500 000 chickens on the infected,
suspected, and neighbouring farms is proceeding without problems.
The "Belgian" method (using carbon monoxide or dioxide) and other
methods, such as electrocution, provide sufficient destruction
capacity.
State-secretary Ross (Public Health) urges all destruction personnel
to get a flu vaccination. Fowl plague is not dangerous, but a person
with flu may undergo the risk of enabling the fowl virus to mix with
the human flu virus, producing a new and possibly dangerous type.
There is no point in vaccinating poultry owners or their families: the
vaccine works only after 10 days, when the birds have already been
eliminated.

[On Sunday, 9 Mar 2003, 3 additional suspected farms have been
reported, bringing the total number of HPAI infected/seriously
suspected poultry plants in the Netherlands to 39. From the official
press release, one may conclude that the presence of LPAI variant
is based upon observed decreased egg production in layer flocks.
The Dutch mass-testing programme is impressive, and is essential
for decision making -- including the possible use of vaccines. It has
been previously reported that veterinary students from the Faculty of
Agriculture in Utrecht have been recruited to assist in the control
and monitoring activities.
This serious outbreak might lead one to question the role that
current farming practices, such as outdoor rearing of poultry --
whether due to animal welfare or other (organic farming)
considerations -- might have played in exposing susceptible
domestic animals to infection. - Mod.AS]
