[In a ProMED posting from 7 July 2017 (Hepatitis A - USA (12): (MI) fatal, RFI Archive Number: 20170707.5158430), according to the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, there had been nearly 190 confirmed cases of hepatitis A in the city of Detroit, as well as Macomb, Oakland, Wayne and St Clair counties and 10 deaths. Those cases were reported from between 1 Aug 2016 and 26 Jun 2017. That represents an increase of nearly 10-times during the same time a year before. Since then, there have been about 120 newly reported cases and 4 more deaths in about 7 weeks.

The mortality rate of 4.4 percent is similar to the parallel outbreak in San Diego County, California. From my colleagues in this area of Michigan, the cohort of homeless and illicit substance users without substantial numbers of MSM is quite similar to the California outbreak. Based on reported data, the viruses are not genetically identical. Between the 2 outbreaks, there had been 30 deaths related to HAV but it is not clear what risk factors may have been present in that group.

ProMED thanks Ms Minicuci for supplying this data. - Mod.LL
