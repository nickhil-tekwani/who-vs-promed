Cholera caused the deaths in Angola of 221 people out of a total of 6655 registered cases in 2013, even though the case-fatality rate (CFR) was lower than in 2012, the Director of National Public Health (DNSP) reported. The data were contained in a balance sheet on the cholera epidemic in 2013 prepared by DNSP and sent by the Lusa Agency.

According to the document, the CFR in 2013 was 3.3 percent, lower than the 2012 6 percent CFR. The cases reported in 2013 were highest in the province of Cunene, with 57.8 percent of the total number of cases, followed by the provinces of Huila, with 21.6 percent, and Uije, with 4.2 percent.

Despite the increased number of deaths in the province of Cunene, the highest CFR was verified in Malanje province, with 21 percent, followed by the province of Lunda Norte, with 10 percent. The fact that the Cunene province in southern Angola has been the most affected by the epidemic is due to the long period of drought, more than 2 years, which also affected parts of Huila province, also in the south of the country.

The DNSP also reported that, compared to 2012, there was a significant increase in the number of cases (as compared to 4457), the deaths having also increased from 135 to 221.

"In analyzing the trend of the epidemic in 2013, the highest incidence was observed in the months of October and November [2013], in which the highest peak was in the month of November 2013 with 2118 cases," the report added. The height of that peak was produced by cases in the province of Huambo in central Angola, which had not had cases earlier in 2013, but this outbreak has waned according to local health authorities, with the number of cases decreasing from a daily average of 15 to one.

In 2006, the 2nd year of statistical data collection by the DNSP, the country registered 69 476 cases and 2773 deaths, but the trend has been decreasing until 2013.
