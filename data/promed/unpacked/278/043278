This news report is in stark contrast to much more cautionary medical
practice in our area where tickborne rickettsial infections (ehrlichiosis
and Rocky Mountain spotted fever) are endemic.
1) The careful enumeration of "tick bites" is very peculiar. Most residents
find many ticks per season, dozens in those who frequent the outdoors.
Perhaps the count is of episodes of clinical RMSF and the bracketed
editorial comment is in error.
2) The rash of ehrlichiosis and RMSF is a very late finding, potentially
beyond the time when antibiotic therapy might reverse fatal disease.
Tick-exposed patients in our area are encouraged to present for specific
treatment (doxycycline unless pregnant or infantile) as soon as they
develop serious systemic symptoms: fever, unusual headache, widespread
muscle pain. Even the history of a tick bite is unnecessary if the patient
spends time in outdoor settings (gardening, sports).
3) Microbiological evaluation of the assaulting tick is a waste of time and
a potential danger to the laboratory workers. Laboratory-acquired
rickettsial infections are very high risk and historically a source of
significant occupational mortality. Even handling the potential vector (to
tape it onto an evidence card) unnecessarily increases patients' exposure.
Empiric treatment is based upon clinical findings, geographical exposure
and the calendar. The delay, cost and dissemination of the pathogen makes
submitting a suspect tick a gesture of unnecessary scientific rigor.
For those patients whose illness seems highly likely to be rickettsial in
origin, acute and convalescent antibody titers provide retrospective
support for a successful diagnosis and treatment. No decision about
clinical management can be made from such information.

In the recommendations for what to do in the event of a tick bite, I agree
with the recommendation that the tick should be saved for identification by
an expert in the event of a subsequent onset of illness. However, the
statement that "If a rash appears, take that card [tick] to your doctor" is
misleading.
With Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF), the onset of symptoms (such as
headache and fever) always precedes the appearance of the rash by 3 to 5
days. In fact, the rash often does not appear until the 5th day after the
onset of illness, and fatalities from RMSF often occur starting 5 days
after the onset and can occur even if antibiotic therapy is commenced at
that time.
Furthermore, up to 30 per cent of RMSF patients never develop the
characteristic rash.
Therefore, persons experiencing the onset of illness up to several weeks
after being bitten by a tick should see a health care provider, and the
health care provider should treat the patient with an appropriate
antibiotic on the presumption of RMSF, without waiting for serological test
results, tick identification or the onset of a rash.

[ProMED-mail thanks Drs Greenberg and Gaines for their useful comments. The
original URL did state that there were 3 other cases of RMSF (not tick
bites), but the final product was edited after it left this Moderator's hands.
Clearly, prompt and empiric therapy is vital here, not confirming a
diagnosis of RMSF prior to instituting therapy. - Mod.LL]
