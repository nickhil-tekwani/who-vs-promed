"Virus" attacks mango farms in Khairpur
---------------------------------------
An unidentified "virus" has attacked the mango farms [in Khairpur district,
Sindh], due to which the fruit has been badly affected.

While talking to newsmen, the growers, and owners of the farms said that
they were facing several hardships due to acute shortage of irrigation
water and now attack of the 'virus' has doubled their problems.

On the occasion, they demanded of the concerned authorities to take notice
of the matter and save them from financial losses.

[Mango (_Mangifera indica_) is one of the most important fruits worldwide.
It can be affected by a large number of diseases, many of which are due to
fungal pathogens. In Pakistan, outbreaks of the fungal diseases quick
decline in 2008 (ProMED-mail post no. 20080229.0832), and powdery mildew in
2007 (ProMED-mail post no. 20070611.1900) have been reported.

Although the item above claims that the crop in Sindh is affected by a
"virus", no virus has been reported from mango so far. It appears likely
that the term is used loosely to refer to an unspecified disease instead.
We would be most grateful for any further information on this problem.
