The Polish authorities have confirmed that African swine fever (ASF) has been found in a dead wild boar at 85 km (about 53 mi) from the border with Germany. The case positive for ASF concerned a wild boar that was found on [4 Nov 2019] after having been killed in a road accident in Lubuskie voivodship. This province borders to Germany in the west.

The Polish Chief Veterinary Inspection broke the news on Thursday [14 Nov 2019]. The animal had been tested at the Polish State Veterinary Institute in Puławy.

The news means that the virus has hopped westward by 300 km (186 mi) all of a sudden. Hitherto it was known that ASF virus was present in wild boar in the area around the capital Warsaw. In addition, it crept slowly westward in northern Poland. Experts agree that when the ASF virus jumps over larger distances, normally it is because of human negligence.

In the interactive map [see in the source URL above], all ASF-infected farms in Poland from 2014 until now [November 2019] are indicated by a blue colour. With regard to wild boar, ASF used to occur in virtually the same regions until this week. The location of the newly found infected wild boar is marked red.

In a press release [see further in the commentary], the Polish veterinary services speak of "an isolated case of this disease in feral pigs, without the possibility of an epidemiological and geographical link with the previously reported cases of ASF on the territory of Poland."

The finding place of the animal is close to the village Tarnow Jezierny, at about 110 km (68 mi) distance as the crow flies from the German cities Frankfurt an der Oder and Cottbus [map at https://tinyurl.com/qo4gsqq].

[The translated and edited official Polish press release dated 15 Nov 2019 follows (at https://www.wetgiw.gov.pl/main/komunikaty/Komunikat-Glownego-Lekarza-Weterynarii-o-stwierdzeniu-przypadku-afrykanskiego-pomoru-swin-ASF-u-dzika-w-wojewodztwie-lubuskim/idn:1138):

"The Chief Veterinary Officer informs that on [14 Nov 2019], based on the results of research carried out at the National Veterinary Institute - National Research Institute in Puławy, the occurrence of the 1st case of African swine fever (ASF) was confirmed in wild boars in the Wschowa County, in the Lubuskie voivodship [map at https://tinyurl.com/sze9kaj].

Obtaining positive results of the study in the Lubuskie voivodship indicates an isolated case of this disease in feral pigs, without the possibility of an epidemiological and geographical link with the previously reported cases of ASF on the territory of Poland. The distance of the current ASF finding site in Lubuskie from locations of previous ASF cases in the wild boar population exceeds 300 km (186 mi).

A positive result of the ASF test was obtained in samples taken from a fallen wild boar found on [4 Nov 2019] near road no. 325 connecting Slawa and Nowa Sol. According to the information contained in the epizootic investigation document, the boar was killed in a traffic accident. The location of the wild boar's corpse is outside the areas covered by regionalization due to the recorded presence of ASF, listed in the Annex to Commission Implementing Decision No. 2014/709/EU of [9 Oct 2014] on animal health control measures in relation to African swine fever in some Member States and repealing Implementing Decision 2014/178/EU.

At present, on-site activities related to the fight against ASF are carried out by the competent authorities of the Veterinary Inspection and the provincial Crisis Management Center (WCZK). The Secretary of State - Government Plenipotentiary for actions related to the occurrence of ASF in the territory of the Republic of Poland, Mr. Szymon Gizynski and Deputy Chief Veterinary Officer, Mr. Miroslaw Welz, participate in the meeting of the WCZK crisis staff.

The Chief Veterinary Officer reminds of the need to comply with the biosecurity rules by persons operating pigs in order to avoid the potential possibility of transferring the disease from the natural environment to the farm.

In case a corpse of a fallen boar is found, it should be left at the place of discovery and the district veterinarian should be immediately informed."

The described, surprising long leap of ASF westward in Poland, yet to be reported to the OIE, is in need of clarification. Alertness in Germany is warranted. - Mod.AS
