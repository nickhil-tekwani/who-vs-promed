A major viral disease of tomato caused by a complex of viruses [of
genus] _Tospovirus_ has been found in all tomato producing regions of
Brazil. It can totally wipe out young tomato seedlings and the only
solution is to breed for resistance against the disease. Studies
showed that [the disease involves] a complex of [tospo]virus species
with different characteristics.

Molecular markers derived from the Sw-5 resistance gene were
developed [at the University of Brazil]. They can be used for rapid
breeding of resistance into commercial [crop] varieties by
differentiating between susceptible and resistant plants. Leonardo
Boiteus, Embrapa Vegetables, said that "the system can be used for
any type of tomato which is important for seed companies that focus
on developing new tomato hybrids."

[Tospoviruses are an extremely important group of plant viruses
capable of infecting a large range of crops. The type member, _Tomato
spotted wilt virus_ (TSWV), has one of the broadest host ranges among
plant viruses and has had a serious impact on many crop species
worldwide. Tospoviruses are transmitted exclusively by thrips, which
are found worldwide. Weed species can serve as pathogen or vector
reservoirs and tospovirus epidemiology is complex.

Disease management of tospoviruses is difficult but may include
vector control (for glasshouse crops), use of clean planting
material, control of weed hosts of virus and vectors, phytosanitary
measures, and use of resistant crop cultivars. Worldwide, the current
commercial resistance of tomato cultivars to TSWV is based on a
single dominant gene, Sw-5, which is derived from a wild
_Lycopersicon_ species. However, strains of TSWV that overcome
resistance based on Sw-5 are emerging (see for example ProMED-mail
post 20050329.0914).

In Brazil, 4 tospoviruses have been reported to infect tomato crops:
_Tomato spotted wilt virus_ (TSWV), _Tomato chlorotic spot virus_
(TCSV), _Groundnut ringspot virus_ (GRSV), and _Chrysanthemum stem
necrosis virus_ (CSNV). A tospovirus disease complex has been
reported to be the main limiting factor for tomato production in the
country since the 1990's. Symptoms have been described as purple
discolouration of leaves, drooping of leaves, necrotic lesions on
stems and fruit, and stunting of plants. There is no evidence of the
disease being seed transmitted. Several tomato varieties and hybrids
are currently available, but the development of better molecular
markers reported above will assist breeders in the race against the
emergence of new resistance breaking viral strains.
