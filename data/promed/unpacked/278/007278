A 7-year-old boy residing in the settlement of Murunkum, Aktyubinsk region
in western
Kazakhstan has been hospitalized with bubonic plague, Zhumamurat Aldashev,
head of the regional Public Health Board, told Interfax-Kazakhstan on
Thursday.
Eighteen residents of the settlement and 78 residents of the southern town
of Aralsk who had contact with the child have also been sent to the
hospital, he said. They show no signs of the plague.

[Kazakhstan has several endemic foci of plague, so on the face of it this is
not an abnormal case. However, the reaction of the authorities in
hospitalizing so many asymptomatic people suggests something is abnormal.
Aralsk is situated on what used to be the shore of the Aral Sea, now almost
dry and the location of the dumping ground for Soviet anthrax weapons and
other nasty material - Mod.JW]
