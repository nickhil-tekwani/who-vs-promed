Another 2 cases of rabies have been reported in Saransk, the capital city
of the Republic of Mordovia. 3 residents of Saransk are now receiving
anti-rabies vaccination.
2 cats in 2 different homes have also died, and their owners took the
carcasses to a veterinary clinic, where diagnoses of rabies were confirmed.
Epidemiologists will interview the 2 families where animals have died to
establish possible contacts with the diseased cats.
According to Nikolay Shavenzov, the head of the city emergency clinic, 3
fatal human cases of rabies have occurred in the past one and a half years.
Fatal human cases have not been reported in the republic of Mordovia for
the last 17 years.
