Mysterious illness strikes birds
--------------------------------
A mysterious illness is making a number of wild birds sick, but it is
only affecting one species, the double crested cormorant. Wildlife
watchers are baffled, because no theory about the illness makes
perfect sense.
Workers at the Conservancy of Southwest Florida's Wildlife Rehab
Center are helping an unusual number of double crested cormorants.
The birds are starving, thin, and lack energy. No one knows what's
causing the mysterious ailment. Workers hydrate the birds and feed
them. Some of them are eating willingly; others have to be force-fed.
Despite all their best efforts, about half the birds that have gone
into the rehab center have died. "Even though you know you're doing
all you can, it's frustrating for some not to make it," said Joanna
Fitzgerald of the Wildlife Rehab Center. The main theory is that red
tide in the gulf is making the double crested cormorants sick. "The
typical signs we see with red tide we just aren't seeing with these
birds. I'm not 100 percent convinced it's red tide," said Fitzgerald.
Double crested cormorants are the birds you see on the side of a lake
with their wings spread out. "These are the ones that dry their
wings, they'll spread their wings to dry after they've been hunting
or fishing," said Fitzgerald.
One of the birds regained enough strength to be able to be released
into the wild in Port Royal. "It's very rewarding when you see them
go," said Rebecca LeBlanc of the Wildlife Rehab Center.

[One would hope that these biologists are having the birds necropsied
and some diagnostic tests run. The article here does not give enough
specifics for speculation.
Avian Vacuolar Myelinopathy (AVM) may be a possibility. If a bird
recovered, then it seems likely that AVM and botulism could be ruled
out.
Certainly, if there is any more authoritative information on this
situation, we would appreciate it. - Mod.TG]
