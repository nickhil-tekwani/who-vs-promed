A beef cattle herd in south Texas has been found to be infected with cattle
tuberculosis (TB), and Texas livestock health officials are seeking the
source of the infection. The disease, caused by _Mycobacterium bovis_, can
produce internal lesions in animals. Cattle TB can be spread within a herd
when an infected animal coughs, releasing bacteria-laden mucus onto feed
that is consumed, or into the air that is inhaled by nearby cows.
"The investigation began early this summer, when a federal veterinarian,
conducting a routine exam in a slaughter facility, detected lesions in a
carcass compatible with those of TB," said Dr. Linda Logan, Texas state
veterinarian and executive director of the Texas Animal Health commission
(TAHC), the state's livestock health regulatory agency.
U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Services
(USDA-FSIS) inspectors are present in all federally inspected slaughter
facilities to examine carcasses for indication of disease. The inspectors
condemn carcasses that are lesioned.
"Tissue samples from the carcass were tested at the National Veterinary
Services Laboratory (NVSL) in Ames, Iowa, where a definitive diagnosis of
cattle TB was made," she said. "We traced the animal back to its original
herd in south Texas. The herd was placed under quarantine, and all of the
adult animals were skin-tested for the disease."
Dr. Dan Baca, the TAHC's TB epidemiologist, explained that, of the 26
animals tested, 10 had positive results. In late August, the 10 animals
were slaughtered, and the carcasses were examined thoroughly for internal
lesions indicative of the disease. Lesions were found in 7 animals, and
tissue samples were collected and forwarded to NVSL for confirmation tests.
The carcasses were incinerated, preventing their entry into food channels.
The remaining 16 animals in the herd have also been destroyed. "Fortunately,
herds surrounding the infected herd have tested negative," said Dr. Baca.
"The lesioned heifer (an offspring of the infected cow detected at
slaughter) had been commingled with 208 steers and heifers. These 208
animals, currently under TAHC quarantine, may be depopulated to avoid any
potential disease problems," said Dr. Baca. "Furthermore, we'll be testing
surrounding herds to make sure there wasn't disease spread. Also, we'll
track any movement of animals out of the herd from the time the lesioned
heifer was introduced. The epidemiological investigation will broaden each
time we find a lesioned animal, in order to make sure we find all
potentially infected animals."
"Cattle tuberculosis was a human health threat in the early l900s, when
infection rates among herds was high and before pasteurization--or heat
treatment--to kill bacteria in milk and cheese," said Dr. Terry Conger,
TAHC's state epidemiologist.
Dr. Conger stated, "In November 2000, all of the U.S.--with the exception
of Texas' El Paso and Hudspeth Counties, and the state of Michigan--was
recognized by the USDA as tuberculosis-free. If we find the TB infection
has not spread beyond the animals we are tracing from the infected herd,
the USDA may allow Texas to maintain its accredited-free TB designation."
He said the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health
Inspection Services, Veterinary Services (USDA-APHIS-VS) has agreed to
provide indemnity--or purchase funds--for depopulating animals involved in
this TB case, including the 79 head of cattle that had been moved out of
the infected herd prior to disclosure of infection.
Keeping a TB-free designation is particularly important for Texas, because
it allows ranchers to move cattle across state lines without having them
tested for tuberculosis. Dr. Conger said testing can be inconvenient and
costly, because it requires that animals be held for 72 hours from the time
an accredited veterinarian injects tuberculin into the skin under the
animal's tail until the site is examined for swelling that indicates the
animal has had exposure to the TB bacteria. A slaughter examination,
followed up with bacterial culture and tissues tests, are necessary to
confirm infection in animals that react to the skin test.
