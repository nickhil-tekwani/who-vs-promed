According to the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization [FAO], Nigeria's yam yield has presently dropped to its lowest level in 2 decades, even though the area under cultivation is rapidly rising. Nigeria accounts for 61 per cent of yam production in the world.

"Seed yam is a big problem," said Robert Aseidu, International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA). "It's only now that we're seeing how big a problem this could become." Due to many years of flawed farm practice, most seed yams have disease. Farmers traditionally keep back the measlier [poorer. - Mod.SH] yams for planting. "They keep accumulating diseases and productivity keeps reducing until you get to a stage where it's no [longer] economical to plant," says Beatrice Aighewi, IITA.

Some scientists have seen the urgent need and high demand for disease free seed yams. Aighewi says the solution to Nigeria's seed yam crisis is large-scale aeroponic seed yam production. She also produces high-yielding and disease-resistant yam varieties.

[Yam (_Dioscorea_ spp.) is an important tuber crop in Africa, the West Indies and parts of Asia and southern America. A number of fungal (anthracnose, leaf blight, tuber rots), bacterial (pre- and post-harvest wet rots), viral (mosaic, 'shoe-string') and nematode (dry rot) diseases or disease complexes are known to affect the crop. Many of these have been reported from West Africa, including Nigeria (see links below).

For predominantly vegetatively propagated crops, including root and tuber crops like yam, potato, taro and cassava, accumulation of multiple viral and other pathogens over successive planting cycles is a high risk. Even low levels of seed tuber infections pose a major risk of both horizontal and vertical pathogen spread. A build up of both numbers and individual levels of pathogens over the planting cycles will eventually lead to weaker and weaker crops, as described above for yams. To return to viable crop production, exclusive use of planting material that was certified, preferably by molecular methods, as being free of pathogens is essential for each crop cycle.

Farm saved or other uncertified propagating materials (including seeds, budwood, rootstocks, seed tubers, cuttings) have often been reported as sources of crop disease outbreaks worldwide. Clean planting stock is vital for successful agricultural systems and, consequently, certification schemes have been set up for relevant crops in many countries.

In aeroponic systems, as mentioned above, plants are grown in a mist environment, without a medium to support their roots. This differs from hydroponics, where plant roots are immersed in a liquid nutrient solution. In both systems, disease (and pest) control is aided by the absence of soil and minimal requirements for handling the plants during growth.
