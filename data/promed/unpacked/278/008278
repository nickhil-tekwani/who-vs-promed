A new strain of a contagious disease killing young pigs has broken
out at piggeries south of Christchurch. A cluster of about 5 pig
farms in a 10-km radius were being investigated yesterday by experts
for the post-weaning multi-systemic wasting syndrome (PMWS). They
suspect the disease is a different strain of PMWS found first at Ted
and Irene Graham's Orini piggery near Huntly in 2003 and spreading to
as many as 18 piggeries around South Auckland. Outside [outdoor?]
piggeries are hardest hit. The source is believed to have come from
overseas.
A pig owner whose animals are among those with the disease said
farmers were worried. "It is part of farming now around the world.
There are farmers who are panicking (about) what to do. It is too
early. All I can say is it is likely (to be here)," said the farmer,
who did not want to be named.
The new strain was identified yesterday by a Massey University animal
health expert, Professor Roger Morris. "We definitely have a new
disease for the Canterbury area which has broken out," he said. "We
have a number of farms affected and all are connected by either being
physically close to each other or have bought pigs from farms within
the cluster. It appears to be the disease PMWS."
Morris said the disease had virtually been eradicated in the North
Island, except from one farm, and was "significantly" different to
the Christchurch strain. He said all the evidence was pointing to a
milder strain which began more spectacularly than the North Island
version but with fewer deaths.
Young pigs in the southern outbreak had demonstrated red eyes linked
to the eye disease conjunctivitis. Death rates are double those for
fatalities among normally healthy young pigs. The disease usually
affects young pigs -- weaners -- aged between 6 and 12 weeks and they
waste away before dying.
Morris said restrictions placed by the Ministry of Agriculture and
Forestry (MAF) on the movement of pigs and pig semen to the South
Island appeared to have worked.
New Zealand Pork Industry Board chairman Chris Trengrove said the
disease was disruptive to farmers, but was being managed in many
countries and had no food safety or human health implications.
Australia remains the only country without the disease which is
otherwise found worldwide.
One piggery has been under surveillance for a couple of months,
although most were notified [reported] only a week ago. MAF
surveillance team manager Ron Thornton said the difficulty of
confirming the disease was that other causes of deaths of young pigs
had to be ruled out, such as parasites, overcrowding or feeding
problems.
One theory is that the disease arrived in the country because pigs
were fed imported uncooked pig meat during more relaxed border
controls, since tightened. However, experts are now speculating that
it may have arrived by birds which would explain why outside
piggeries were affected.

PMWS was first notified in New Zealand in late 2003. MAF
investigation of the disease led to the conclusion that it was
widespread. It was considered ineradicable due to the wide
distribution and limitations in diagnosing the syndrome.
The pig industry developed a control plan for PMWS in the North
Island. No South Island cases were confirmed at the time.
MAF maintained movement controls to allow industry time to work
through its control options.
5 properties in the South Island have signs suggestive of PMWS. The
investigation on one of the earlier farms has not yet confirmed PMWS.
The industry and their pig experts have been involved in
investigating the other 4 farms, as it has been agreed that industry
will manage PMWS within New Zealand but MAF will provide assistance
as required.

[Postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) of swine, due to
porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2), was identified in western Canada in
1991; however, retrospective studies from several countries indicate
PMWS was present in the previous decade. PMWS is distributed
worldwide and most swine-producing countries report variable
prevalence of the disease. The primary manifestations are poor growth
rate, ill thrift, and/or wasting. PMWS often occurs after weaning in
pigs 4-14 wks old. The disease can also be seen in older pigs,
particularly finishing pigs that weigh 45-70 kg. Morbidity is
typically 5-20 percent among cohorts in the nursery or finishing
stages. Mortality in swine that show signs of PMWS often is above 50
percent. In addition to death loss, PMWS in finishing pigs may
prevent, or substantially delay, affected pigs from reaching market
weight, which can result in economic loss for the producer.
