Echinococcus in Aysen Region, Chile
-----------------------------------
"Hydatidosis [also known as echinococcosis or hydatid disease] is an endemic and extremely relevant disease in the [Aysen] region, where the average is more than 15 times the national average," said Health SEREMI [regional governmental ministerial unit], Dr Pablo Mardones, in a statement during the opening of a workshop on Wednesday morning [18 Apr 2012] in Coyhaique.

This pathology has grave consequences in the Aysen region, where the high rates reported result in surgery with high economic and social costs for those who suffer it. "We have a rate of about 35 cases per 100 000 inhabitants, 35 new cases each year, and usually the disease is detected when the cysts, which are usually located in the liver and in the lungs but can be even in the brain, are large and require surgery," said Mardones.

The disease is endemic in the region and despite campaigns its eradication is unlikely. "Here in the region, from the epidemiological point of view, [hydatidosis] is an endemic disease that has always been present. There have been campaigns, rates have decreased but increased again. But the region has never had national average rates," summarizes the regional secretary.

The workshop in Coyhaique joins the meetings and activities that have taken place in Cochrane (2011) and Puerto Cisnes this year [2012], mainly aimed at sensitizing the rural population.

"Health is not achieved by the health authority alone. The population must be educated and therefore participation of the educational and agricultural communities, and of cattle farmers of all major sectors [is essential] and that is what we are working on" through these workshops and joining efforts as a society in order to lower the infection rates.

"This is part of a project we are developing and will submit for funding with regional funds; a long term project that aims to reduce the rates of hydatid disease."
