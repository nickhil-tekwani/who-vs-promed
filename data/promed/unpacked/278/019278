An anthrax outbreak near Bogor, West Java has claimed 6 lives and
hospitalized 8 people since 16 Oct 2005. The virus [sic; see Moderator's
comment below] may have affected as many as 65 people so far. Ministry of
Health officials report that infected goat meat was the cause. To stem the
spread of the [infection], the GOI [Government of Indonesia] has ordered a
quarantine of the affected villages, as well as the slaughter of all goats
and goat pens in the district. Officials say they are tightening controls
on livestock shipped to Jakarta-area slaughterhouses. Anthrax is endemic to
this part of West Java -- about 60 kilometers from Jakarta -- due to poor
animal husbandry practices as well as ineffective prevention and treatment.
The government's response to this anthrax outbreak will be an early test of
inter-ministry and central-regional coordination.
Anthrax outbreak in Bogor Regency:
----------------------------------
The district health office in Bogor, West Java reported that an anthrax
outbreak had occurred in the village of Citaringgul, Babakan sub-district,
on 16 Oct 2005. According to the health office, 6 people died and 8 more
were hospitalized after eating infected goat meat. The district health
office said an initial health survey shows that the virus has affected as
many as 65 people, the largest outbreak in years.
Anthrax is endemic to nearly all of Indonesia. However, it is particularly
common to this sub-district in West Java, which covers 208 square
kilometers and is home to 35 villages and over 430 000 people. Since 2001,
the Bogor Health Agency has recorded 47 cases of anthrax infection and 11
fatalities. The _Bacillus anthracis_ bacterium is normally found in soil
and ingested by livestock, who then transmit [it] to humans.
Central and regional governments respond:
-----------------------------------------
President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono (SBY) reacted quickly, expressing his
condolences to the families of the victims and directing his ministers to
take action. Health minister Dr Siti Fadilah Supario warned the public to
report immediately to health facilities any evidence of anthrax symptoms in
people or livestock. She also visited Bogor victims on 23 Oct 2005,
informing them that the government would cover the costs of their medical
treatment.
Agriculture minister Apriyanto ordered the distribution of 300 000 doses of
anthrax vaccine across the country to prevent the spread of the disease. He
also directed the Bogor district government and its agencies to isolate and
ban inter-regional transportation of livestock from the affected
sub-district of Babakan. Bogor agriculture officials have ordered locals to
slaughter and burn all goats and goat pens in the sub-district. The
Agriculture Ministry's director of Vectorborne Disease Eradication also
deployed an investigation team to the area.
The regional disease prevention health office has placed warning signs in 9
villages within the endemic area. Additionally, the regional livestock
office is vaccinating other cattle not yet infected by the anthrax
[bacillus]. The office oversees the regular vaccination of livestock in the
endemic area. The last anthrax vaccination occurred 19-30 Aug 2005. The
next vaccination will occur in November-December 2005, prior to the January
2006 Idul Adha religious holiday. During Idul Adha, large numbers of
livestock are slaughtered throughout the country and given as gifts to less
fortunate people.
The National Institute of Health has asked the US Mission's Naval Medical
Research Unit (NAMRU-2) to confirm the presence of anthrax in 5 samples
taken from the affected area. NAMRU-2 is currently testing those samples.
Obstacles to anthrax eradication:
---------------------------------
According to the Health Ministry's director of Vectorborne Disease
Eradication, Dr Rusmini, there are several reasons why anthrax is such a
persistent problem in the Bogor district. He cited a 2002 study conducted
by the National Institute of Health and Balivet Laboratory in Bogor, which
noted the following concerns:
-- longevity: anthrax bacterial spores can remain active for decades in dry
soil. The study recommends that the central and regional governments
relocate villagers and help them develop new farmland outside the endemic
area.
-- education: low education levels among the local population hinder
government efforts to educate the public about anthrax prevention and control.
-- limited vaccine supply: according to the study, the supply of anthrax
vaccine is only enough to cover about 12 per cent of at-risk animals.
Inadequate inspections and biosecurity measures also contribute to the
recurring cycle of anthrax outbreaks. Pre-mortem or post-mortem inspection
by competent officials can identify diseased animals/meat and prevent them
from entering the food chain. However, it is common in rural areas of
Indonesia for animals to be slaughtered in back yards or in unregulated
abattoirs, where inspection officials and appropriate sanitary measures are
completely absent. Weak slaughterhouse controls and lack of implementation
on feed requirements (such as, to prevent contamination of the feed supply)
compound the risk.
Comment: Anthrax outbreaks are regular events in this area and local animal
health authorities should have been closely monitoring livestock for
telltale signs of disease. The public has praised the SBY government's
quick response so far. However, enforcing the quarantine, destroying other
diseased animals, and implementing biosecurity measures will provide an
early test for the new Minister of Agriculture and his team. Indonesia has
less than a stellar record in these areas. Stopping the cycle of outbreaks
is a longer-term issue that will require closer monitoring of livestock in
endemic areas and enhanced sanitary and inspection procedures.

[There is little to add to the US Embasy comments, except that with
competent control measures involving both annual vaccination and the proper
handling of outbreaks when they occur, the risk of this disease can be
radically reduced, and in time eradicated. Ground contamination is not
eternal. The spores do die and others lose their plasmids, thereby becoming
apathogenic. Effective disease control has been successfully demonstrated
by many countries. The "causes" given above are excuses, not reasons. The
vaccine is one of the easiest and cheapest to produce, so claims of limited
supplies reflect deeper problems. The slaughter of preclinical cases
represents a slight public health risk, as the bacteremia at that time in
cattle, sheep and goats is low and can be hard to detect. The public health
problems come from slaughtering sick animals (which do have high
bacteraemia) in an effort to minimise the financial cost of disease -- in
the absence of treatment and if it is feared the animal will die. In Muslim
and Jewish communities, dead animals may not be eaten and a common
characteristic of anthrax is that ruminants are found dead. If the meat is
to be (sold and) eaten, the sick animal must have been killed first. This
adds to the frequency of shade-tree slaughter and butchering of sick stock,
non-inspection, and informal and irregular sales.
While goats do graze, they are primarily browsers. When they graze it is
not close to the ground, as it is with cattle. So this probably started
with cattle and the subsequent contamination of nearby browse by blowflies
which had fed on the abandoned carcass(es). Goats can be successfully
vaccinated, as can sheep and cattle. And vaccination is a lot cheaper than
relocating villages.
Thanks to Peter for bringing this report to our notice. - Mod.MHJ]
