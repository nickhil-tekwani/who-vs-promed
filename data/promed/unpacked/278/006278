According to preliminary data, more than 50 people sought medical
attention due to phosphorus poisoning. These people were in the zone
of the accident [on 16 Jul 2007, a freight train derailed and released
a cloud of toxic gas]; most of them are local residents or people
involved [in clean-up operations]. All of the victims are hospitalized
in the 4th military hospital.
"The deputy chief of the Lvov Public Health Department, Miron
Borisevich, stated that local hospitals are ready to receive
casualties. The supply of drinking water to villages in the Busskoro
region had been cut. The inhabitants of villages affected by the
disaster have been advised to remain indoors, make use of sorbents
[see comment], and have been forbidden to use water from wells."
[The Lvov city council of the Ministry of Emergencies and Affairs of
Population Protection], has communicated to area residents that the
several wagons of the cargo train loaded with phosphorus that
overturned about 50 km (31 mi) from Buzskiy district do not pose a
health threat to the inhabitants of the oblast center areas.
As was reported previously, on 16 Jul 2007, a train derailment caused
15 tanker cars loaded with yellow phosphorus to overturn. Phosphorus
leaked and 6 tanker cars caught fire, releasing a toxic cloud that is
now about 90 km [55.9 miles] in radius and affecting 14 inhabited
areas where 11 000 people live, including the Radehovskiy and
Brodovskiy districts of Lvov. Another 800 people live in Buzskiy
district.

According to Sergey Isayev, professor of chemical sciences at the
National University "Kiyevo-Mogilyanka Academ", the final consequences
[of the phosphorus spill in the Lvov region] will become obvious with
time. His preliminary observation on the catastrophe is that nothing
similar has happened before in Ukraine. "I think that officials are
not telling the whole truth. It is very important that wagons
transporting phosphorus have particular specifications to prevent the
contact of phosphorus with air."
Even in special containers, it should be transported under inert gas.
The containers should be airproofed. That is why the method of
transportation of the phosphorus is being questioned. Also, usually
phosphorus as a substance should not be transported in large
quantities, only as compounds. [It is difficult to see how contact
with the air could be avoided when the containers leaked. - Mod.JW]
Now more on the consequences: The cloud that is formed contains
phosphoric acid that will come back to earth as a concentrated
chemical rain. The concentrated acid burns everything. That is why
ecologists should be concerned. Chronic poisoning is also not
excluded; when the excess of phosphorus is collected in the human
body, it 1st affects the liver, later the kidneys, and other internal
organs involved in substance exchange.
It is not recommended that people eat food grown in the garden because
the soil could be contaminated. Unfortunately, domestic animals cannot
be prevented from eating the grass. Over time, the danger of
phosphorus poisoning will diminish, but residual phosphorus will be
preserved in the soil for a long time. If phosphorus appears in ground
water, due to excess of phosphors, stronger biological forms start to
develop that can suppress other biological forms of
life. This is called a biological catastrophe: overgrowth of life
forms that are not considered by the natural ecosystem [see ProMED
refs. below. - Mod.JW]

[According to the previous posting on this topic, only 16 people were
initially hospitalized and a day later we have more than 50. More
negative consequences can be expected. - Mod.NR
Sorbents are insoluble materials or mixtures of materials used to
recover liquids through the mechanism of absorption, or adsorption, or
both. It is supposed that the recommendation is to use these
materials to absorb the phosphorus from contaminated surfaces. - Mod.JW
See ProMED-mail 20070719.2310 for a discussion of white/yellow phosphorus.
