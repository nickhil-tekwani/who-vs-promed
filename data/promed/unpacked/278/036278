Study: 2nd drug to treat cattle deadly to vultures
--------------------------------------------------
A 2nd drug used to treat cattle for pain could be deadly to
endangered vultures and should be prohibited as part of a campaign to
prevent their extinction, according to a study released Wednesday [9 Dec 2009].

Millions of long-billed, slender-billed, and oriental white-backed
vultures have died in South Asia -- mostly in India -- after eating
cattle carcasses tainted with diclofenac, an anti-inflammatory
painkiller given to sick cows.

Now, researchers writing in the Royal Society journal Biology Letters
have found that a 2nd drug, ketoprofen, has proven toxic to vultures
and should no longer be used to treat livestock in Asia.

"Surveys of livestock carcasses in India indicate that toxic levels
of residual ketoprofen are already present in vulture food supplies,"
the researchers wrote. "Consequently, we strongly recommend that
ketoprofen is not used for veterinary treatment of livestock in Asia
and in regions of the world where vultures access livestock carcasses."

Tens of millions of vultures played a key role in South Asian
ecosystems before the introduction of diclofenac in the early 1990s.
Now, populations of the 3 species of the critically endangered,
griffon-type vultures are thought to have dropped by as much as 97
percent, according to Britain's Royal Society for the Protection of Birds.

Vultures play a vital role in disposing of carcasses, keeping down
populations of stray dogs and rats that also feed on dead cattle and
can spread disease among humans.

"From millions of individuals in the 1980s, vultures have simply
disappeared from large swaths of India, Pakistan, and Nepal, and at
least 3 species have been brought to the brink of extinction," said
Richard Cuthbert, one of the study's authors and a scientist with the
Royal Society.

"The rate of decline of these magnificent birds is staggering," he
said. "For the oriental white-backed vultures, for every 2 birds
alive last year [2008], one will now be dead, and this is all because
of the birds' inability to cope with these drugs in livestock
carcasses, the birds' principal food source."

The swift demise of the vultures prompted authorities in India to ban
diclofenac more than 2 years ago. Conservationists are hoping
authorities take similar action with regards to ketoprofen and
require farmers to use only meloxicam, which has proven safe.

"We would like to see other safe alternatives, but it should be the
responsibility of the Indian pharmaceutical industry to test these to
determine their safety to vultures," said Vibhu Prakash, director of
the vulture program of the Bombay Natural History Society in India.

[Ketoprofen is an NSAID (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug). NSAIDs
are capable of causing gastric ulcers and are excreted, eventually by
the kidney. However, the vulture kidney does not excrete NSAIDs but
rather concentrates them. Diclofenac acid is another NSAID and
vultures die from that as well. - Mod.TG]
