[Sangardo is a sub-prefecture in Kissidougou Prefecture (which is presented as No. 18 in the administrative map available at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subdivisions_of_Guinea#Prefectures). It borders the province Kankan on its northeast (No. 15 in the map).

Animal farming is Guinea's 2nd activity of the rural sector after agriculture, counting (2016, total estimates) 6 759 000 cattle, 2 380 000 sheep, 2 851 000 goats, and 130 000 pigs. Farm animals are the main source of income to 30% of the rural population. The herd is almost exclusively composed of local breeds, such as the N'dama cattle (99.9% of cattle) and Djallonkes sheep and goats (99.7%). Apart from pigs, which are mainly found in Forest Guinea and Lower Guinea, the other species are distributed over all natural regions.

According to WRL data, FMDV (Foot-and-mouth disease virus) serotype O was identified in Guinea in 1999 and 2018, and FMDV SAT1 is "sporadic." OIE reported FMD outbreaks that date back to 2014 and 2018.
