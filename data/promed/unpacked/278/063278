The city of Trois-Rivières is affected by an increase in legionellosis cases. A total of 8 cases have been detected this month [July 2017]. A rather high number, as the region normally has between 1 to 8 cases a year.

Patients affected by the bacterium [_Legionella_] are still hospitalized. No deaths related to the infectious disease have occurred. It is a type of pneumonia with cases at different levels of severity.

What is worrying is that the source of the bacterium has still not been localized. The authorities are examining several hypotheses. The hospital has not been involved.

Legionellosis is not transmitted from person to person. It is caused by the inhalation of micro-contaminated water droplets suspended in the air. The bacteria can be found in showers, water heaters, spas, and cooling towers with water.

Legionellosis is normally uncommon in Quebec. In 2012, in the Capitale-Nationale, a legionellosis epidemic killed 13 people. [Capitale-Nationale is one of 17 administrative regions of Quebec, Canada; Quebec City, Quebec's capital, is located in this region, having 73.7 percent of the region's population of 700 616 residents (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitale-Nationale).]

[Trois-Rivières, with a population of 134 413 residents, is a city in the Mauricie administrative region of Quebec, Canada, located on the north shore of the Saint Lawrence River approximately halfway between Montreal and Quebec City. A map of this region can be found at https://www.google.com/maps/place/Trois-Rivières,+QC,+Canada.

Legionellosis comprises several different syndromes caused by _Legionella_ species, most commonly _Legionella pneumophila_, although 19 other _Legionella_ species have been isolated from human infections: The pneumonic form is called legionnaires' disease; the less severe, self-limiting, non-pneumonic form is called Pontiac fever. Extrapulmonary infections, e.g., wound infections, may occur. The 8 cases that have occurred in the past month [July 2017] in Trois-Riviere presumably have legionnaires' disease since the news report says they have pneumonia.

_Legionella_ species are found in natural and man-made aqueous environments and soil. Several of these _Legionella_ species are intra-cellular parasites of free-living amoebae. Humans acquire these organisms after exposure to natural or man-made aquatic reservoirs, usually by means of inhalation of aerosols, but also by aspiration, or less commonly by inoculation of wounds.

The species of _Legionella_ identified in the 8 patients is not specified in the news report. A common source would be suspected if the 8 patients were infected with the same species and their genotypes matched. We are also not told if there are any epidemiological linkages among the 8 patients; this could help identify possible common sources. Isolation of _Legionella_ from an environmental source that matched the clinical isolates' species and genotype would pinpoint transmission pathways. More information in this regard would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.ML
