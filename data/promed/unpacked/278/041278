[A patient] used to travel once a week from his home in Dumas for chemotherapy treatments at Arkansas Cancer Institute. [The 56-year-old patient] had been going to the Pine Bluff clinic for about a year for treatment of his multiple myeloma, which is a cancer of the plasma cells. It had been going "all right," he said. He'd gotten to know the other patients a little, and it was more convenient than going all the way to Little Rock [Arkansas]. Until August [2018], that is, when something went wrong.

The trouble began with an unusually bad reaction to a treatment, which put him in bed for a few days with chills and stomach pain. He told a nurse about it when he went back for his next treatment -- after which he was taken away in an ambulance. "I felt like I was dying," he wrote in a statement about the incident. "My whole body was in pain." He wrote that he was hot, cold, throwing up, and had "severe weakness." [The patient] was transported to Jefferson Regional Medical Center, where he spent 7 days fighting a mysterious infection that he says left him bedridden for 2 weeks after he got out of the hospital. He later learned that he was one of more than 50 people, mostly cancer patients, who were infected in a bacterial outbreak at Arkansas Cancer Institute.

Months have passed since the peak of that outbreak, during which the Arkansas Department of Health, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], the clinic and nearby Jefferson Regional Medical Center engaged in rapid-fire correspondence as the health organizations worked to respond to the situation, emails and meeting and call records show. Those records were obtained by the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette through an Arkansas Freedom of Information Act request. More recently, the state Health Department's investigation of the outbreak, which identified a new species of bacteria, has moved into an academic phase that could lead to publication of a scientific article.

Alarm bells didn't go off at the Health Department initially. Health officials at first suspected that a Jefferson Regional Medical Center laboratory's discovery of an unusual bacterial infection was an error. _Mycobacterium parafortuitum_ is rare and wasn't thought to cause disease in people, state epidemiologist Dr Dirk Haselow said in a recent interview. "It was somewhat discounted, because no one knew what to do with it," Haselow said. "As we started seeing more infections, we realized something was wrong." On [5 Sep 2018], Jefferson Regional Medical Center staff members reported to the Health Department a cluster of infections among patients that had appeared during the last 2 weeks of August [2018]. The reported constellation raised the number of cultures showing the unusual bacteria to 13.

Within days of that report, investigators were able to trace the outbreak to Arkansas Cancer Institute and identify its source: saline flushes, which the clinic used on patients who had chemotherapy ports, devices implanted under the skin that help in giving medications. In a [6 Sep 2018] email to other officials, Kelley Garner, program coordinator and epidemiology supervisor for the state's health care-associated infections program, wrote: "Yesterday [5 Sep 2018], [Arkansas Cancer Institute] requested blood cultures be performed on 11 patients who were having fever, chills, and nausea and as such missed their oncology appointments. We spoke with the medical director of the clinic, who reported that patients would come into the clinic ok, but after 30 mins after accessing the port would become severely ill and were taken to the Emergency Department at the acute care hospital at which point some were hospitalized," Garner wrote.

The next day, [Fri 7 Sep 2018], a Health Department team conducted site visits at Jefferson Regional Medical Center and Arkansas Cancer Institute. A written recap of those visits describes, "a few non-standard practices observed at [Arkansas Cancer Institute]," including the saline flushes. According to Health Department documents and correspondence, the cancer clinic was preparing saline flushes by filling syringes from a large bag of saline fluid and storing them for up to 7 days for later use, rather than using factory-sealed, single-use syringes pre-filled with saline.

On [10 Sep 2018], an infection-control nurse at Jefferson Regional Medical Center wrote to the Health Department to say that the hospital's lab had tested saline bags and syringes from Arkansas Cancer Institute. She wrote: "4 of the 5 syringes showed growth very similar to what we have seen from the blood cultures, leading [the lab] to believe that it is the mycobacterium."

On [13 Sep 2018], a letter of formal recommendations to control the outbreak went out from the Health Department to Arkansas Cancer Institute. Topping the list of recommendations was an advisement to "replace saline flushes drawn from a larger bag of saline with sealed, pre-drawn saline flushes. Discontinue future use of locally-filled flushes," 2 officials wrote. "This appears to have taken place on [Tue 11 Sep 2018], but we would like confirmation from you that no more homemade flushes are being used."

In an email exchange with Arkansas Cancer Institute administrator Michael Legate on [18 Sep 2018], Arkansas-based CDC epidemic intelligence service officer Dr Sarah Labuda explained that neither the federal agency's nor the Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology's guidelines recommend pre-drawing of saline for flushes, and that syringes of that type would be considered good for only 24 hours in a pharmacy. Officials continued to study the outbreak in subsequent days and weeks, looping in infectious-disease specialists from the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences and the CDC.

A new wrinkle appeared when a CDC analysis clarified that the bacterium was not _M. parafortuitum_, but a new, related organism temporarily dubbed _Mycobacterium_ sp. FVL 201832.

As the investigation into the cause of the infections continued, Arkansas Cancer Institute worked to contact and collect samples from more than 150 patients thought to have been exposed to the bacteria, though only about a third of those ended up testing positive for the infection.

Legate and clinic president Dr Omar Atiq declined interview requests for this article, referring questions to an attorney. Records show that the clinic's formal communications with affected patients did not always make clear the source of the infection. A conference call invitation set for [14 Sep 2018] between Jefferson Regional Medical Center, the Health Department and Arkansas Cancer Institute calls for "each organization to have people on the phone that can discuss risk management strategies and make high level communication decisions."

A patient notification letter from the clinic dated [20 Sep 2018] went through several revisions and ultimately did not mention saline flushes, citing work with state and federal health regulators "to determine the cause of the infection and to put in place steps to prevent it in the future." An undated, 11-step script for calls to summon patients for screening ("How are you doing today? Have you had any fever or shakes lately?") also does not refer to the investigation into the cause of the infection.

Health Department officials had been investigating the outbreak for almost 2 months by the time the 1st news report about it, a segment on Little Rock television station KARK, appeared around Halloween [31 Oct 2018]. By that time, 3 patients who had been infected with the bacteria had died, though their deaths could not be explicitly linked to the infection.

In interviews and statements at that time, the clinic began acknowledging the saline flush issue to media. "While the specific cause of contamination is still unknown, the source has been determined to be the saline flushes that are no longer in use. The process Arkansas Cancer Institute used for 27 years without any complications has been replaced with a different process to prevent future infections," an October [2018] news release said.

[A previous ProMED-mail post reported on this outbreak at a single cancer therapy facility (we now learn was the Arkansas Cancer Institute in Pine Bluff, Arkansas), where 52 patients with indwelling central venous access catheters undergoing cancer chemotherapy developed a bloodstream infection due to the same bacterium not previously known to be a pathogen; 3 of the patients died. The bacterium, initially thought erroneously to be _Mycobacterium parafortuitum_, is now identified as _Mycobacterium_ sp. FVL 201832. This organism has been traced to a saline solution used to flush indwelling central venous catheters; syringes were filled with saline from a large bag of saline fluid and stored for up to 7 days for later use, rather than using factory-sealed, single-use syringes pre-filled with saline.

Cancer treatment frequently requires access to the bloodstream on an ongoing basis for administration of fluids, cancer chemotherapeutic drugs, blood transfusions, and antibiotics, which requires an indwelling catheter or port that has been tunneled under the skin and then inserted into a large, central vein. These indwelling, tunneled central venous catheters must be flushed frequently with either heparin or saline solution to keep them clear of blood and prevent clotting.

_M. parafortuitum_ is a rapidly growing non-tuberculous _Mycobacterium_, initially isolated from soil in Japan in 1966 (https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/docserver/fulltext/micro/42/1/mic-42-1-7.pdf). A member of the _M. parafortuitum_ complex has been said to rarely infect patients with chronically indwelling vascular access (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971208016962 and https://www.hindawi.com/journals/criid/2016/5167874/).

Pine Bluff, Arkansas, with a population of about 50 000 residents, is a city about 45 miles (72 km) south of Little Rock, the state capital (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pine_Bluff,_Arkansas); a map showing the location of Pine Bluff can be found at https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Little+Rock,+AR/Pine+Bluff,+AR.
