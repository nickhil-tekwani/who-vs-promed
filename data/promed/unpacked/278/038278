A mysterious illness is causing calves to bleed to death on German
farms. Veterinarians are stumped over what is causing the deaths:
vaccines, genetically modified feed or perhaps even the 1st mother's
milk? What can a cattle farmer do when he sees blood running from his
calves like water, when they become lethargic and febrile and, by the
next morning, are lying dead on the floor, their coats covered in blood?

"Our calves from last summer looked like they had been beaten," says
farmer Robert Meyboom, who is still shocked and perplexed today. "The
animals' bodies were covered with drops of blood, and their eyes were
bloodshot.? The veterinarian tried everything, he says, including
administering vitamins and blood-clotting agents. But nothing worked,
and "within 2 or 3 days, they were all dead." Meyboom, a farmer from
Wesel in the Lower Rhine region of western Germany, has lost 7 animals
since the 1st calf bled to death in his barn in October 2007. The last
calf died an agonizing death only a few weeks ago. Farmers refer to
the victims as "blood sweaters," alluding to the way blood seems to
seep from the pores in some of the calves.

A mysterious disease is rampant in Germany's cattle barns. The
afflicted 2-3-week-old calves begin bleeding massively and are often
dead within hours. More than 100 cases have been documented throughout
Germany, most of them in Bavaria, but the number of unreported deaths
is believed to be much higher. Cases have also been reported in
Belgium, but experts are still puzzled over what causes the condition.
"This disease is still very mysterious, and clarification is urgently
needed," says Wolfgang Klee of the Clinic for Ruminants at the
University of Munich in Oberschlessheim on the city's outskirts.
Ottmar Distl of the University of Veterinary Medicine Hanover
describes the bleeding calf phenomenon as "terrifying." "We rarely see
diseases that are fatal in so many affected animals," he adds.

Veterinarians have been studying the unexplained deaths for the past 2
years, and the results of their efforts began to emerge last year.
"Affected animals bleed from various parts of the body, sometimes from
skin that is seemingly intact," says Klee. He has observed bleeding in
the mucous membranes, blood accumulating under the white part of the
eye, and blood oozing from the tiniest of cuts. The animals develop a
fever and soon die. The experts have discovered massive bleeding of
the subcutaneous tissue and intestines. The bone marrow is also
severely damaged, and veterinarians describe its consistency as
"gel-like." Blood cells are formed in the bone marrow, and the sick
animals apparently lack platelets, which are indispensable for
coagulation. In addition, the calves' white blood cell counts are
substantially lower than normal, making the animals more susceptible
to infection.

The unexplained illness has farmers deeply worried. Many farmers blame
the "blood sweating" on a controversial vaccine against bluetongue
disease, which became mandatory for cattle in Germany in April of last
year [2008]. [But the farmer quoted above said he saw cases in late
2007. ? Mod.JW]. Since then, farmers who refuse to vaccinate their
animals are threatened with fines.

Veterinarians, on the other hand, are trying to find a scientific
explanation. The vaccination against bluetongue disease is not
responsible for the blood sweaters, says expert Distl, who notes:
"Calves of mothers that were not vaccinated have also contracted the
illness." The scientists also believe that genetic defects are
unlikely as a cause, because the problem has affected calves from 3
different breeds. They have also ruled out a viral or bacterial
infection, because the animals are not infecting each other.
Pesticides or genetically modified feed are not the cause, says Distl,
explaining that "the distribution of cases simply does not bear this
out."

But other observations are striking. For example, there have been
strange clusters of "up to more than 40" sick calves at individual
farms, says Klee. Besides, all animals Klee has examined came from
farms that vaccinate against Bovine Virus Diarrhea (BVD). That
ailment can cause symptoms similar to those of the mysterious blood
sweating, but calves are not even immunized against BVD. "So far, we
have a few pieces of the puzzle, but not enough to put together a
cohesive picture," says Klee. The scientists now plan to pursue one
lead more intensively. In their 1st few hours of life, calves drink
their 1st mother's milk, known as breastings. Scientists believe that
this initial breast milk, which is so important for the young animals,
could contain antibodies that attack and destroy the bone marrow. "The
symptoms always occur after the calves have received their 1st
breastings," says Distl.

There is still no proof of this hypothesis, and scientists continue to
search for possible causes. Beginning in April [2009], the Bavarian
State Office of Health and Food Safety will systematically test milk
and blood. Veterinarian Klee plans to survey fellow veterinarians
throughout Germany to learn about their experiences. A meeting at the
Federal Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Consumer Protection in
Berlin is scheduled for the end of the month. "The government must
make the problem a high priority," says Distl.

Until then, farmers will likely have no other choice but to hope for
help from above. The most devout place consecrated bunches of herbs in
their homes, barns and gardens. An alternative practitioner for
animals recently announced that he had healed a calf with a
homeopathic remedy derived from snake venom. But Klee dismisses the
claim, saying that an analysis of a blood sample from the animal
revealed that it was not a blood sweater, after all.

Veterinarians have at least seen some success, and a few calves have
survived the grim bloodletting after being given blood transfusions.
The vets have also started treating concomitant disorders, like
pneumonia and diarrhea. And then there are the less orthodox methods.
Distl has 3 animals in his barn that recently almost bled to death.
His treatment approach is not exactly the stuff of intensive care
medicine. "Do nothing!" says the veterinarian. "Whatever you do, don't
touch them! You will injure the calf the minute you touch it, and it
will hemorrhage. Then you won't be able to do anything else for the
animal."

[This adds little to what has been posted before except it adds colour
and some numbers of more animals being affected. As they are housed
animals it must make one consider some feed contamination, and, if so,
one that could be so widespread. If that was due to young ferns [see
[3] below], how did they get into the feed? - Mod.MHJ]

There are a multitude of viral hemorrhagic fevers; not all are
Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever or Ebola or Marburg. I wonder whether
these animals are:

(1) genetically related, since there is some geographic distance, or
(2) whether the bulls are genetically related.

There was a similar situation in pigs in the USA when they were on a
particular feed drug, and it was found that all the pigs traced back
to a certain pig that was some great prize-winner and a great
offspring producer.

How do they know the bluetongue virus vaccine is not inducing this
syndrome in certain genetic strains? What proof is there? Is this the
1st or 2nd year of this vaccine? Is this syndrome similar to the Rh
factor? Feed or feed additives like vitamin premix also come to mind.

What are the necropsy findings? There are various forms of
erlichiosis, which affects dogs, people and horses; why not cattle?
Besides having no platelets, what else is different in the blood of
these calves? What kind of plants are out in the fields? Are there
radiomimetic plants that could cause bleeding?

(1) If not already done, 500ml of the 1st colostrum [breastings] of
all cows on affected farms should be collected, labeled, frozen, and
stored. This could be excellent evidence. Stored serum from the mother
would be a bonus.

The cows that have calves with these blood symptoms should be
identified (easy). The colostrum can then be unfrozen and fed to mice
or other experimental mammals to see whether there are toxins present
which target the bone marrow.

It is still unlikely but just possible that some form of toxin in
forage (i.e. bracken fern family, or coumarins produced by fungi and
molds) are being eaten by the mothers and concentrated in the colostrum.

(2) If BVD-vaccinated herds are involved, there may also be something
new to science. Antibodies derived from BVD vaccine and bluetongue
antibodies present in colostrum may fix together in individual cells
in calves of certain genetic make ups, thus provoking an autoimmune
response. This might take 2-3 weeks to appear clinically. The fact
that a herd is not vaccinated against BT does not mean it has not been
field challenged, and, therefore, if only one BVD vaccine is involved,
this would be worth following carefully, and the vaccine manufacturer
may take interest. The stored colostrum could be useful for following
up this line of enquiry.

Thus, a treatment, apart from doing nothing ([which is] reasonable) is
steroid (high dose, long acting, and so only one needle for 4-plus
days), antibiotic cover (high dose, long acting), and possibly a
single blood transfusion, probably not from the mother but from a cow
which has not had a "bleeding" calf.

Interestingly, we recently treated a one-off "bleeding"
4-month-plus-old calf here with steroid, Vit K, and an antibiotic, and
it worked, but we may well be dealing with something different. The
blood picture showed poor bone marrow response to anemia of unknown
cause. Otherwise, this is still a mystery.

especially, Bavarian colleagues can keep us up to date on this problem
as it progresses and as the etiology is clarified. - Mod.MHJ]
