[This OIE update indicates 7 new outbreaks involving 65 buffaloes, 2 cattle, and 12 sheep and goats cases in total. These new outbreaks are widely dispersed and range the north to south of Egypt.

Controlling an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease is always a challenge, especially when it involves a strain which has not been circulating in the area recently, as is the case currently in Egypt. Foot-and-mouth disease is a really fast moving disease. Both vaccination and movement controls are critical.

For additional insight comments on some of the challenges in deploying vaccine under the present circumstances see Mod.AS comments in Foot & mouth disease - Egypt (09): update, vaccine, OIE 20120321.1076906.
