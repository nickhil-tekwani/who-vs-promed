Decades ago when I was putting together info on states' observance of research-based changes to the Compendium of Animal Rabies Control and Prevention, Dr. Charles Rupprecht of the CDC sent me quite a bit of reading material. One thing of interest in the research articles was that dogs are among the mammals which can contract rabies by eating infected, recently dead animals. (Cats and ferrets are not, despite ferrets being descended from a member of the canine branch of Carnivora.) There certainly are other routes of exposure which also do not leave a wound, as in intense investigation of an animal with dumb rabies, or infected saliva getting into eyes. Unvaccinated dogs without wounds therefore can also be infected.

The following link could be useful for emergency room and infectious disease physicians using your service: http://www.cdc.gov/rabies/resources/contacts.html.

And the CDC always includes the latest rabies compendium from the National Association of State Public Health Veterinarians among useful references: http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr6006a1.htm?s_cid=3Drr6006a1_w.

[Our thanks to Dr. Crandall for this useful comment in relation to oral exposure in dogs eating a freshly dead rabid carcass and the saliva of dogs with dumb rabies. Something to keep in mind that next time -- and they come around, believe me -- when one is having to deal with a suspect rabies dog. And yet another reason to keep one's own rabies shots up to date. - Mod.MHJ]
