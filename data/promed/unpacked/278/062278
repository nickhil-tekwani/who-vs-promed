Reason for notification: Reoccurrence of a listed disease
Date of previous occurrence 5 Jul 2008
Manifestation of disease: Clinical disease
Causal agent: Capripoxvirus
Nature of diagnosis: Clinical, Laboratory (advanced)
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country

New outbreaks
Outbreak 1 Shiluo Township 1, YUN-LIN
Date of start of the outbreak 18 Mar 2010
Outbreak status Resolved (11 Apr 2010)

Outbreak 2 Shiluo Township 2, YUN-LIN
Date of start of the outbreak 18 Mar 2010
Outbreak status Continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit Farm

Summary of outbreaks Total outbreaks: 2
Total animals affected
Species Goats
Susceptible 814
Cases 82
Deaths 30
Destroyed 784
Slaughtered 0

Epidemiology: Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection -
Unknown or inconclusive.

Epidemiological comments: Clinical signs such as papules and hard
scabs were observed by veterinarians in 2 goat farms located in
Yun-Lin county on 9 Apr 2010. The veterinarians reported them to the
prefecture animal disease control competent authority. An official
veterinarian inspected these farms the same day. Samples were
collected and sent to the Animal Health Research Institute. The
positive results obtained by electron microscopy and PCR demonstrated
that the outbreaks were caused by Capripoxvirus on 10 Apr 2010.
Movement control was imposed on the index farms on 10 Apr 2010. All
susceptible livestock in these farms was destroyed on 11 and 12 Apr
2010. 11 goat farms within a 3-km-radius of the index farms were
examined by clinical investigation, and the animals were healthy.
Further monitoring and surveillance of those farms in the control
zone will be carried out.

Measures applied - Stamping out; Movement control inside the country;
Disinfection of infected premises/establishment(s); Vaccination
prohibited; No treatment of affected animals.

[There were 2 outbreaks of sheep and goat pox in both June and July
of 2008. These were the 1st occurrences of sheep and goat pox in
Taiwan. The outbreaks occurred in T'ao Yuan in the Northwest coast of
Taiwan, whereas these new outbreaks are in the middle of country on
the west coast.

Because Taiwan is a relatively small island, the animal populations
can move into different regions with relative ease. A devastating
example of this occurred in the 1997 Taiwan outbreak of foot and
mouth disease, which spread among large proportions of the swine
population due to intricate marketing and production movement
patterns. One would suspect that sheep and goat movement patterns may
not be as intensive, but they may play a role in this outbreak. On
the other hand, this may be a completely new incursion of sheep and
goat pox onto the island. This will be a critical question for the
outbreak investigation to answer, which could be done by using
molecular epidemiology to compare with previous outbreaks.

The anatomical pathological laboratory finding is most probably a
result of the necropsy investigations. Sheep and goat pox findings
upon post mortem often reveal necrotic foci on mucous membranes,
enlarged lymph nodes throughout the body, papules or sometimes
ulceration in the abomasum, rumen, intestines, tongue, hard and soft
palates, esophagus and trachea as well as multiple nodular lesions up
to 5 cm in diameter in the lung, particularly the diaphragmatic lobe;
