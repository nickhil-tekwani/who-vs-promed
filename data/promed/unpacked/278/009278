[This is the 2nd outbreak in the last couple of
weeks with the 1st being the outbreak in the
Czech Republic. The UK has already had
significant ongoing problems as well, and on 28
Mar 2008 there were 122 confirmed premises
affected by Bluetongue. It was anticipated that
the onset of vectors would occurred in mid April
2008 in the UK but there certainly are a slew of
new cases already. Last year's 1st spring
outbreak occurred in Germany in late May 2007.

Whether these cases are a reoccurrence of last
year's case or new outbreaks is an important
question. In this new outbreak near Verona,
Italy, there may be an argument that the virus
did not overwinter there because this report is
an OIE immediate notification report which
signals the beginning of a new event.
Furthermore, BTV-8 had not extended into this geographic region last year.

An excellent article publish in the EID journal
entitled Bluetongue Epidemiology in the European
Union by Claude Saegerman, Dirk Berkvens and
Philip S. Mellor addresses some of the issues
surrounding the overwintering and resumed
transmission problems. See Emerging Infectious
Diseases: Volume 14, Number 4Â­April 2008
<http://www.cdc.gov/eid/content/14/4/539.htm?s_cid=eid539_e#cit>

The authors suggest:
--------------------
Moreover, in relation to the demonstrated
overwintering ability of the virus in northern
Europe, small numbers of adult Culicoides spp.
were captured in animal housing during the winter
period (25 Nov 2006 to 9 Mar 9 2007) (i.e.,
females of C. obsoletus complex, males of C.
obsoletus, C. scoticus, and C. dewulfi) (25).
Whether the occurrence of these midges and the
possibility of their activity extending over the
winter in such climatically protected locations
can explain the persistence of virus from 1
vector transmission season to the next (13) or
whether they represent newly emerged midges from
nearby breeding sites is not known (25). Several
hypotheses have been formulated to explain the
overwintering ability of BTV: by persistence
within surviving adult vectors themselves,
transovarial transmission through the vector, or
prolonged/persistent infection in viremic or
aviremic vertebrate hosts (13,25,26).

The focus of interest now is to see if BTV is
able to survive regularly between vector seasons
and become endemic to northern Europe. The
recrudescence of BTV-8 in northern France, the
Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, and Germany in
2007, and also the emergence of BTV-8 in the
United Kingdom, Denmark, Switzerland, and the
Czech Republic, suggests that this may well be
the case (27,28). Unlike farther south, where
populations of the traditional vector, C.
imicola, peak in the late summer and autumn, when
most BT cases occur, populations of the
indigenous European vectors peak earlier in the
year; whether this will be reflected in a change
in the temporal occurrence of BT cases remains to
be seen. In the period from 1 Jan 2006, through
28 Dec 2007, 12 EU member states and Switzerland
reported BT outbreaks on their territories,
comprising all of the serotypes reported in
Europe since 1998 (Figure 4) (29,30).

Also, see comments by Mod.AS in Bluetongue -
Europe (06): BTV-8, UK (England) 20080209.0522
for more ideas on this question.

The OIE reported referenced above has a map of
the outbreak location. The outbreak location in
Verona can be seen in relation to the recent
Czech Republic outbreak. See Healthmap site
