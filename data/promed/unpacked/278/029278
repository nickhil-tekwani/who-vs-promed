Health officials this week [week of 18 Apr 2010] expressed concern
about the resurgence of hantavirus infections, especially in the
earthquake stricken southern parts of Chile. Between January and
April [2010], 30 cases have been reported, one third of them
resulting in death. [During the same period] in 2009, only 17 cases
were reported.

The [Andes] hantavirus causes high fevers and respiratory problems,
and often results in death. The virus [was first detected. - Mod.TY]
in Chile in the mid-90s and in recent years has occurred mostly in
southern parts of the country -- regions such as Bio Bio, Araucania,
Aysen, and Los Lagos.

The [Andes] hantavirus is often spread when tourists or campers enter
abandoned houses or cabins and unknowingly inhale air-born particles
of dried rat feces, which carry the virus.

The Health Ministry reports that the increase in hantavirus
[infection] cases is probably due to increased rainfall during the
last months of 2009 -- creating conditions favorable for rats. "Since
long-tailed rats cannot find enough food in their natural
surroundings they sometimes go to houses and fallen buildings to feed
themselves," said Viviana Rodriguez, an expert from the Health
Ministry's Epidemiology Department.

This year [2010], 10 cases have already been reported in the Bio Bio
Region, while one infection has been reported in Valparaiso, 2 in
O'Higgins, 3 in Maule, 2 in Araucania, 4 in Los Rios, 6 in Los Lagos,
and 1 in Aysen. The last 2 infected persons are from Los Lagos Region
and Licanten, in the Maule Region.

The Health Ministry called for a special alert for people showing the
[Andes] hantavirus [infection] symptoms: fever (over 38 deg C/100.4
deg F), muscle pain, and intense headaches. People living in the
earthquake-struck areas must be especially precautious when handling
food and disposing garbage, to avoid any contact with infected
rodents. Authorities recommend that earthquake victims now living in
outdoor tents should have a "floor" inside and should immediately see
a doctor if they present any of the signs detailed above.

[Although not mentioned specifically, the hantavirus responsible for
these cases is doubtless Andes virus.

[2] Chile (Los Rios)

A [laboratory] test gave positive hantavirus [results] for a blood
sample sent to the Public Health Institute (ISP) during this week
[week of 18 Apr 2010]. This report is of a 31-year-old man resident
of the Hueima locale, in the Lanco commune, who died on 9 Apr [2010]
in the hospital of that commune.

[Health] professionals of the Health SEREMI [Regional Ministerial
Secretariat] are carrying out the respective epidemiological
investigations, for which they visited his home and environment,
finding risk factors in areas neighboring the house.

It is worth recalling that in the Los Rios region to date, 4 people
have been confirmed with [a] hantavirus [infection] -- a 4-year-old
girl of the rural sector of San Jose de La Mariquina, 2 young men,
aged 20 and 23 from the Corral and Futrono communes respectively, and
a 20-year-old woman from the Panguipulli commune. However, this is
the 1st death associated with [a] hantavirus [infection] during the
present year [2010].

A boy and his aunt died of a hantavirus infection. The victims aged
10 and 60, came to the hospital in "extremely critical" condition.
Another member of the family also is admitted to hospital due to the disease.

Both of the fatal [cases] resided in Oran, located north of Salta and
considered a hantavirus focus. Both died within days of each other,
stated the Diario La Prensa website. They lived in the Rio Blanco
settlement, west of the city, and were attended 15 days apart in the
San Vicente de Paul Hospital of Oran.

Julio Moreno, administrator of this health center, explained that the
2 patients, who died during this past month, came with "extremely
critical" clinical pictures. He confirmed also that a member of the
same family is admitted to hospital, although his [clinical] progress
is favorable.

"Years ago we had entire families who contracted the virus," the
physician sated, "which is why the [current] situation is not
considered a new one."

According to Moreno's statement, "it is this season when cases of
hantavirus [infection] are habitually registered." These days, it is
much easier to detect them, he continued, due to the fact that the
provincial laboratory of tropical diseases is located in Oran. This
specialist recalled that, before this center was established, "there
were deaths because erroneous treatment was given to hantavirus
[infection] cases, which could have been confused with dengue,"
because the symptomatology of both diseases "is similar, although the
treatment which must be given is diametrically opposed."

The hantavirus present in Salta is likely to be Oran virus with its
sigmodontine rodent host being _Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_.
