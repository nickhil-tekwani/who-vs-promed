Bird flu has appeared in the Palestinian Authority [PA]. Following
the death of numerous chickens in Tulkarm, the PA sent several dead
birds to the laboratories of the Veterinary Services at Beit Dagan.
The lab investigation revealed the deadly avian influenza.

[Israel's] Ministry of Agriculture Inspection Unit for Fauna and
Flora, which carries the responsibility for the control upon animal
and plant movements, has intensified its control upon the border
crossings, gateways and passages between the West Bank and Israel to
prevent smuggling of infected poultry.

The Director of Israel's Veterinary Services, Dr Moshe Haimovich, has
urged the public to buy poultry and eggs only in regulated stores/enterprises.

Last week, the highly pathogenic avian influenza was discovered in
the small children's zoo of Kibbutz Ein Gedi, where all avians were
destroyed by the inspectors of the Services to prevent the spread of
the epidemic.
