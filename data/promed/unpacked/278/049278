WASHINGTON, April 6, 1998 - The U.S. Department of Agriculture proposes to
add 15 newly developed varieties of rust-resistant barberry plants to the
list of plants allowed interstate movement without unnecessary
restrictions.
The list of added barberry varieties by species are: Berberis: pirate king,
amstelveen, chenault, wallich's purple, claret cascade, aurea nana, bail
green, concorde, criruzam crimson ruby, green carpet, midruzam midnight
ruby, royal burgandy, and royal cloak. Mahoberberis: smaragd. Mahonia:
charity. Quarantine regulations govern the movement of certain plants of
the genera _Berberis_, _Mahoberberis_, and _Mahonia-, known as barberry
plants, to prevent the spread of black stem rust. Rust-resistant species
may be moved if accompanied by a certificate.
The addition of these 15 varieties to the list of rust-resistant berberis,
mahoberberis, and mahonia species is based on recent testing designed to
determine if the plants are resistant to black stem rust, said Alfred S.
Elder, deputy administrator for plant protection and quarantine with USDA's
Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, a part of USDA's marketing and
regulatory programs mission area.
Black stem rust is one of the most destructive plant diseases of small
grains that is known to exist in the United States. The disease is caused
by a fungus [_Puccinia graminis_ Pers. f. sp. _tritici_ Eriks. & Henn. -
Mod PKA] that reduces the quality and yield of infected wheat, barley, and
rye crops. In addition to infesting small grains, the fungus lives on
alternate hosts including barberry plants.
This proposed rule is scheduled for publication in the April 7 Federal
Register. Consideration will be given to comments received on or before
May 22. Please send an original and three copies to Docket No. 97-053-1,
Regulatory Analysis and Development, PPD, APHIS, Suite 3CO3, 4700 River
Road, Unit 118, Riverdale, Md. 20737-1238.
