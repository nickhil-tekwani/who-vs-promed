News of the response

Point of entry surveillance
- Epidemiological surveillance at entry points has adopted a new strategy in relation to the new response plan put in place. This strategy consists in making the entry points work [24 hours a day] with the support of the security services. To this end, surveillance at the points of entry has already identified 7 priority entry points (PRRP, Kanyabayonga, Mukulia, Kasindi Foner, Foner Komanda, Ituri Bridge, and Mabakese), including 4 -- namely, PRRP, Kanyabayonga, Mukulia, and Kasindi Foner -- that are already implementing [24 hour a day] screening with police support. It should be noted that all these priority points are control points, except Fonner Kasindi, and are an integral part of the 77 entry points that are functional. These priority points will be increased later on the basis of the migratory flow and the expansion of the epidemic.
- This new strategy and growth, compared to those who refuse screening, which is decreasing from 0-9% to 1% on average, has improved the point-of-entry surveillance that has already reached 30 million screened travelers.
- Screening at entry points aims to stop the circulation or spread of Ebola from one medium to another. To achieve this objective, port-of-entry services conduct human observation to detect travelers with clinical signs related to Ebola virus disease, use temperature sensing to detect persons with more than 38 deg C/100.4 deg F, and record all travelers to identify the epidemiological link between their home environment and their destination environment.
- Once a person meets the case definition, they are considered alert and automatically placed in isolation for investigation. If the investigation validates this case, it is transferred to the Ebola treatment center for further investigation by laboratory or biological analysis.
- Entry points are roads or any road that leads to another country, while the checkpoint is internally between agglomerations.

Vaccination
-----------
- Since the beginning of vaccination on 8 Aug 2018, 71 449 people have been vaccinated.

[2] Summaries
- Fri 1 Feb 2019. Guarded optimism as DRC Ebola outbreak hits 6-month mark
[CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy), edited]
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2019/02/guarded-optimism-drc-ebola-outbreak-hits-6-month-mark
[Byline: Lisa Schnirring]

As the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) reached the 6-month mark since declaring its latest Ebola outbreak, some top World Health Organization (WHO) officials expressed guarded optimism about the battle against the disease, while acknowledging ongoing challenges. And in the latest developments, the country's health ministry announced 4 new cases, and the WHO expressed sadness over the death of a member of the outbreak response in Beni, where early indications suggest the man's death was not caused by Ebola or violence.

On guard against complacency
-------------------
Speaking at a media briefing in Geneva, Matshidiso Moeti, MD, the WHO's regional director for Africa, praised the WHO staff on the ground and the leadership of the DRC's health ministry. "We can clearly see the strategies that have been successful in controlling the outbreak in some of the affected areas, such as Mangina, Beni, Komanda, and Oicha, though we continue to face flareups in some of these areas and outbreaks in others."

She said the different outbreak locations involve different drivers of transmission, with response actions tailored accordingly. For example, she said a combination of interventions in Beni and Mangina, including investments in community engagement, have almost brought the Ebola situation under control.

"We have been very pleased with the support of local leaders," she said. "Clearly, we can't become complacent. We understand very well that we still have a lot to do to stabilize and bring the situation under control."

Worry over nosocomial spread
--------------------
A big ongoing concern is healthcare-related Ebola infections linked to visits at private and public health clinics, Moeti said.

The WHO addressed that issue yesterday in its weekly snapshot of the outbreak, noting that the latest outbreaks in Katwa and Butembo are partly driven by nosocomial infections. Since 1 Dec 2018, 86% of patients infected in the 2 areas (125 of 145) had visited or worked at a healthcare facility before or after they got sick. And, of those, 21% reported having been at a health facility before their Ebola symptoms began, suggesting nosocomial transmission.

Over the past 3 weeks in Katwa, confirmed Ebola patients had been treated in 49 different health settings, including 9 where nosocomial transmission may have occurred. Over the same period, 8 new Ebola infections were reported in Katwa's healthcare workers, pushing the overall outbreak total in medical staff to 65.

"Response teams are following up with the identified healthcare facilities to address gaps around triage, case detection, and infection prevention and control measures," the WHO said in the update.

Some signs of calming
----------------
Mike Ryan, MD, WHO's assistant director-general for emergency preparedness and response, just returned to Geneva from the North Kivu province outbreak area. He told reporters that the area seems to be entering a period of relative calm, following unrest owing to the recent election and other social issues and from general mistrust about Ebola and the outbreak response.

He said health officials are seeing some success in having people from local communities lead the response, and though workers are seeing much lower levels of the reactive type of resistance, security is still a big issue. Responders, he said, still need security escorts and special protocols to stay safe in many areas.

Ryan emphasized that teams are working in all active Ebola transmission zones and that, despite surge staffing because of recent disease spikes in Butembo and Katwa and security challenges, health officials have been able to sustain and increase the number of responders in other areas.

Though there are still concerns about pockets of disease in remote locations, a large number of areas haven't seen any new cases in 21 or 42 days, and the geographic scope of the disease is less than before, Ryan said.

The immediate challenge in Butembo and Katwa is containing the virus before it moves again. "We're working against the clock," he said, noting that the disease can move from a rural area back to an urban area. "It's really important that we chase the tail of this thing, and we don't leave any chain of transmission untouched. And that's why we're operating very much deep in the field with our colleagues to chase the virus."

Experimental treatment update
-------------------
At today's briefing Moeti said about 350 people with Ebola have been treated with experimental drugs.

Ryan added that, anecdotally, when looking at the results, doctors are seeing higher rates of survival. "But we have to be extremely careful. There are lots of biases in there regarding the condition of the patient when they arrive; there are so many other factors at play," he said. "But we're certainly encouraged by the data we've seen."

Randomized controlled trials are underway to more definitively interpret the clinical experience with patients, Ryan said, adding that officials are also seeing that patients who come early for treatment are surviving in much higher numbers. "We're really trying to work with communities to encourage suspect cases and families to bring their loved ones as soon as possible to the treatment units."

Response worker's death likely not Ebola
-------------------
Moeti said the Ebola responder who died in Beni was a financial administrator who had been deployed from the Central African Republic. He apparently died in his sleep, a tragedy for the local team and the man's family, she added. Medical authorities are working to establish the cause of death, but so far, the early indications don't point to Ebola or violence.

In a statement on the man's death today, the WHO's African regional office said, "Our hearts go out to the family of our colleague. We pay tribute to the many dedicated men and women from across the African region and beyond for their work towards ending the Ebola outbreak in the DRC."

-31 Jan 2019. Ebola virus disease - Democratic Republic of the Congo
[Disease outbreak news: Update 31 January 2019, abridged, edited]
https://www.who.int/csr/don/31-january-2019-ebola-drc/en/

The Ministry of Health (MoH), WHO, and partners continue to respond to an outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD), despite persistent challenges around security and community mistrust impacting response measures. Relatively high numbers of cases were reported in recent weeks (Figure 1), mostly driven by the outbreak in Katwa Health Zone, the current focus of large-scale response activities. Smaller clusters continue to be reported beyond Katwa Health Zone, including from Beni and Oicha; however, teams have quickly and systematically responded to these clusters to prevent onward transmission and guard against further geographical expansion of the outbreak. Teams are also working actively to strengthen community trust and participation in all affected areas.

... [As of 29 Jan 2019], among cases with a reported age and sex, 59% (439/750) were female, and 30% (224/749) were aged less than 18 years, including 115 children under 5 years.

During the last 21 days (9 Jan - 29 Jan 2019), 118 new cases have been reported from 11 health zones (Figure 2), including Katwa (80), Beni (9), Butembo (7), Kayina (5), Manguredjipa (4), Oicha (4), Biena (3), Kyondo (2), Musienene (2), Komanda (1), and Vuhovi (1). In addition, 5 historic probable cases from Komanda Health Zone were reported during the past week with illness onset dating back to November 2018.

The outbreak in Katwa and Butembo health zones is partly being driven by nosocomial transmission events in private and public health centres. Since 1 Dec 2018, 86% (125/145) of cases in these areas had visited or worked in a healthcare facility before or after their onset of illness. Of those, 21% (30/145) reported contact with a healthcare facility before their onset of illness, suggesting possible nosocomial transmission. In Katwa, during the past 3 weeks (since 9 Jan 2019), 49 health structures were identified where confirmed cases were hospitalised, including 9 health centres where nosocomial transmission potentially occurred. Moreover, during the same period, 8 new healthcare worker (HCW) infections were reported in Katwa; overall, 65 HCWs have been infected to date. Response teams are following up with the identified healthcare facilities to address gaps around triage, case detection, and infection prevention and control measures.

[3] Assessment after 6 months
- Fri 1 Feb 2019. Why Congo's Ebola outbreak still going strong
[AP News, edited]
https://www.apnews.com/8a99202b716c43f6aad6b831ecfe0521
[Byline: Cara Anna]

The Ebola outbreak in eastern Congo, the 2nd-deadliest in history, marks 6 months on Fri [1 Feb 2019] and is moving toward the major border city of Goma, a development that would greatly complicate any hope of stopping the virus' spread in the unstable region.

This may be the most challenging Ebola outbreak ever. Health workers face the threat of attack from rebel groups and resistance from frightened communities. A highly mobile population produced 2 scares in the past week alone: the discovery of an infected, wide-ranging young trader led to vaccinations in a new, 3rd province near the South Sudan border. And 2 contacts of Ebola victims slipped away and were found in the capital of neighboring Uganda, free of the virus.

And yet this outbreak has seen a number of advances, including the widespread use of an experimental Ebola vaccine and a clinical trial of experimental treatments. Health workers say conditions have improved from the devastating West Africa outbreak a few years ago, when some patients were housed by the dozens in sweltering tents and used buckets for toilets.

Congo's health ministry reports 759 cases, including 705 confirmed cases and 414 confirmed deaths. Ebola is spread via infected bodily fluids, including those of the dead.

More than 70 000 people have received the experimental Ebola vaccine, whose efficacy has yet to be determined. Some people who have received the vaccine have still fallen ill. As concerns about the vaccine stockpile grow, drug maker Merck last week said it will ship another 120 000 doses or so to Congo by the end of this month [February 2019].

Women and children make up a worrying number of cases, including more than 160 children under age 18. More than 280 children have been orphaned, the UN children's agency says.

Cases are still emerging without any link to confirmed ones, a sign of how difficult it is to track the virus in a dense and often wary population in a region with little infrastructure. Millions of people have been checked for Ebola at border posts with Rwanda and Uganda, which the World Health Organization says are at "very high" risk.

"People don't yet know what the disease is," Dr. Brian D'Cruz with Doctors Without Borders said this week, a startling comment 6 months into an outbreak in which health teams have hustled to combat misinformation as soon as cases appear in communities. One survivor, Aline Kahindo Mukandala, recounted for the medical charity how she and others had thought Ebola patients at treatment centers were simply zipped into body bags on arrival.

"No, the foreigners are not here to steal our organs," another survivor tells communities as he helps the International Committee of the Red Cross speak out in churches, markets, and schools.

Ebola response workers have been attacked, both by rebels and community members. Other people fearing Ebola try to flee. Each suspension of virus containment efforts because of a security threat can lead to a jump in new cases.

The Ebola outbreak is now a day's drive from Goma, a city of more than 1 million people on the heavily traveled border with Rwanda. The UN says coordination of the outbreak response is already being moved to Goma, where nearly 2000 frontline workers have received vaccinations in preparation.

Some health experts have warned that the infectious disease could defeat efforts to contain it and become a permanent threat in the turbulent region, which would force already struggling health clinics to adapt their operations. Ebola response workers aim to keep a 2 m [6.6 ft] distance from those infected and ideally wear head-to-toe protective gear. How local workers would assist with childbirths, treat malaria, and carry out other daily activities among North Kivu province's estimated 7 million people remains to be seen.

And were Ebola to become entrenched there, international efforts to stop the disease would need continued resources and funding, while neighboring countries would need to make border health checks permanent to prevent the importation of cases.

ProMED-mail Rapporteur Kunihiko Iizuka

[There are several points raised in this report that are worth discussing. One is the statement that "some people who have received the vaccine have still fallen ill." There has been little, if any, information on the Merck vaccine efficacy, likely because we are still in the middle of the outbreak. The case numbers remain low with limited spread suggesting it is working well. But one would anticipate that individuals who are vaccinated after already being infected may not be protected depending on time since infection. It would be good to read more on this. Perhaps vaccination post-infection plus antiviral therapy could be more protective. And it's possible that severity of illness may be diminished by the vaccine even when it is delivered post-infection.

Also, the continued suspicion the communities have of the Ebola treatment centers is somewhat astounding after they have observed their family, friends, and neighbors suffer from Ebola disease without having had any exposure to the treatment centers. Changing these false perceptions is clearly a major challenge that social scientists can best address.

Ebola outbreaks are so devastating because of the disease's impact on children, especially on top of loss of family members to the violent conflict in the region. Cases include "more than 160 children under age 18. More than 280 children have been orphaned, the UN children's agency says." It will take a long time for communities to recover from this terrible loss.

How the DRC would manage were Ebola to become endemic in the region, as raised in this report, must be considered in order to preemptively prepare for that possibility. Healthcare centers would need to be re-designed and many more frontline workers vaccinated. But the authorities do appear to be optimistic the DRC is on the right path to stopping transmission before this would occur. - Mod.LK]

- Sat 2 Feb 2019. WHO is "optimistic" about Ebola control
[Radio Okapi, online trans., edited]
https://www.radiookapi.net/2019/02/02/actualite/sante/rdc-loms-assez-optimiste-sur-le-controle-debola

Six months into the Ebola outbreak in the DRC, efforts to stop the spread of the virus are "encouraging," Dr. Matshidiso Moeti, director of the WHO Regional Office for Africa, said in Geneva today.

"What worked well was public health measures such as training of infection prevention and control agents in health centers," Moeti told reporters for the World Health Organization.

Dr. Matshidiso Moeti also emphasized closer engagement with communities, especially women and religious groups, as well as other health measures such as contact tracing alongside the use of newer tools in the fight against Ebola.

Faced with the press, Dr. Moeti posted her optimism about the evolution of the disease and the change observed on the ground "with the help of local community leaders."

What she sees as a "strategy of success" has led to a situation "almost under control in Beni, Mangina, Komanda, and Oicha" 6 months after the beginning of the epidemic.

In these 1st 2 epicentres of the health crisis, the combination of different actions contributed to the situation. "We have learned lessons from the epidemic in West Africa, including the importance of engaging with local communities to avoid distrust and suspicion," she added, especially because the setting up of an effective response sometimes faces many difficulties, including the very unstable security context or certain reluctance of the population, to which the WHO teams must adapt.

For WHO, it is therefore a question of continuing their efforts with communities to try to reduce fears about the care provided by health personnel.

"Despite ongoing challenges related to the security and distrust of local communities that impact response measures, our teams are continuing the fight," said Moeti. In this respect, she mentions a gradual improvement in the face of these resistances.

The UN Health Agency realizes that "insecurity continues to be a factor" affecting the system put in place by WHO and its partners. However, the situation is "relatively quiet compared to the pre-election period," which had resulted in the postponement of the presidential election in Beni, said Dr. Mike Ryan, assistant director general for emergencies, returning from the area. Many armed groups had carried out attacks.

According to Dr. Ryan, the teams are operational in all areas even though in some communities they need "special security measures" to work.

"This is the case in Biena, Kalunguta, Kayina, Kyondo, Mangurujipa, or Komanda, places where the WHO and its partners need escort or special protection," said Dr. Ryan, recalling that teams are in all "areas of active transmission of the virus."

"But we thank the forces of MONUSCO that allow us, with his escorts, to continue working in this environment," he said while emphasizing the indispensability of "this safety umbrella" of UN peacekeepers.

"A relatively high number of cases has been reported in recent weeks, mainly because of the epidemic in the health zone of Katwa," said the WHO in a statement released Thu 31 Jan 2019. Nearly 178 suspected cases are under investigation, and of the 7 new confirmed cases, 6 are in Katwa and 1 in Butembo.

To better control the disease, more than 70 000 people have been vaccinated in 28 health zones, spread among 4 provinces of the Democratic Republic of Congo. And 350 were treated with new drugs widely used for the 1st time. "The response also consists of the border work the DRC shares with its neighbors," said Dr Moeti.

Neighboring countries are also on the alert. Several thousand health personnel were vaccinated, including 2600 in Uganda alone.

About 200 specialists have been deployed to assist these governments. The priority in the DRC is now to prevent the epidemic in the west of the affected region from spreading further, especially since Ebola is not the only health problem facing the DRC. The country faces diseases such as cholera, measles, polio, monkey pox virus, and malaria.

"Not to mention the health needs of the humanitarian crisis in other provinces. This puts a lot of pressure on the health system in general, "added Dr. Moeti.

Moreover, in Beni, the epicenter of Ebola, WHO is also involved in the fight against malaria. A campaign targeting 300 000 people in this area provided free distribution of impregnated mosquito nets and anti-malaria drugs.

- Fri 1 Feb 2019. Top WHO official sees progress in grueling fight against Ebola outbreak
[STAT News, abridged, edited]
https://www.statnews.com/2019/02/01/top-who-official-sees-progress-in-grueling-fight-against-ebola-outbreak/
[Byline: Helen Branswell <@HelenBranswell>]

... So far, 18 health zones in 2 provinces in northeastern Congo -- North Kivu and Ituri -- have reported cases. That part of the country is engulfed in a decades-long conflict that has significantly hampered efforts to stop spread of the virus.

While moving about can be difficult -- unsafe -- for the outbreak response workers, people in the area, which is populous, are highly mobile. That has allowed for a frustrating phenomenon in which someone who gets infected in one area will travel to another to evade detection or to be with family, igniting transmission in a new location. On more than one occasion, a place where Ebola transmission had been stopped has experienced renewed spread sparked by the arrival of another infected person.

Earlier this week, the Congolese ministry of health reported on the case of a traveling trader who contracted the disease in Katwa and then returned to his home in Watsa, more than 300 miles [483 km] -- and more than nine hours by road -- away. Ryan said a response team quickly moved in and vaccinated the man's contacts and their contacts to try to prevent the virus from taking off once again.

For much of the autumn, the major transmission hot spot was a city of more than 200 000 people called Beni. But after months of effort -- and the administration of more than 20 000 doses of an experimental Ebola vaccine made by Merck -- the outbreak there appears to be on the verge of ending, Ryan said.

The city had gone nearly 3 weeks without a case, but recently 6 new infections there have been reported. All were connected to known chains of transmission, said Ryan, who described the outbreak in Beni as being on "that bouncy road to zero."

Katwa -- and the neighboring city of Butembo -- have been harder nuts to crack, with members of the community refusing in many cases to cooperate with the response teams. But Ryan said efforts to get community leaders and civil society groups engaged in the containment fight are bearing fruit.

The number of alerts -- tips from people that someone might have Ebola -- is on the rise. And people sick with the virus are going to treatments centers earlier in their illness. Where a few weeks ago most people waited 8 or 10 days to go, many are now showing up 2 or 3 days after developing symptoms. That's critical: cases cared for in treatment centers are more likely to survive. It also lowers the risk they'll transmit the virus to family members.

"Even in Katwa, where there is intense transmission, there are hopeful signs," said Ryan.

Still, as the grueling outbreak enters month 7, response leaders aren't taking anything for granted. "A tremendous amount has been achieved. But we're not done. And we're nowhere close to being done," Ryan said. "And we're going to be working in Katwa for weeks to come to suppress transmission."

Uganda's disease surveillance system was recently put to a rigorous test when 2 people, contacts of confirmed Ebola virus disease cases in Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), crossed into the country through Kasindi Point of Entry (PoE) on 20 Jan 2019.

The 2, a female and male, are from Katwa in the DRC, where they were under daily follow-up by health workers. However, they managed to escape the surveillance teams in DRC and made their way to Uganda through Kasindi, where again, they eluded Uganda's surveillance teams at the PoE as they had no symptoms.

Luckily, their disappearance and movement to Uganda were promptly detected and reported by colleagues in DRC, thanks to the excellent cross-border collaboration. Uganda's surveillance system immediately swung into action using health workers, security personnel, immigration officers, and village health teams (VHTs), among others, to look for the duo.

The hunt has not been easy or quick, and it brought tremendous anxiety to many people. But on 30 Jan 2019, the 2 were located in one of the suburbs of Kampala. They were in good health with no signs and symptom for EVD, and they have completed the 21-days mandatory follow-up for all EVD contacts.

While Uganda's disease surveillance system is commended for actively looking and follow up the 2 cases, the incident also points to some gaps that exist especially on the porous border. People do not necessarily use the gazetted crossing points, which makes the work of disease surveillance officers a daunting task. A sensitive surveillance system at health-facility and community levels is the safety net for the country, given that people incubating Ebola disease can easily cross into the country.

In addition, the incident is a wakeup call to all people that EVD is just a few hours away from Kampala or any other city, given the efficient transport system that connects the world. As WHO constantly reminds everybody, alertness by all, a high index of suspicion, especially for sickness with bleeding tendencies, and prompt reporting are key to early detection and containment of the disease.

Uganda has activated an elaborate community engagement and community-based disease surveillance system, especially in the 5 EVD very-high-risk districts to help with disease surveillance and prompt reporting. Under this arrangement, WHO has supported the Ministry of Health to train and deploy 7387 VHTs, 265 traditional leaders, 330 religious leaders, 1463 sub-county leaders, and 2693 LC1 chairpersons in the 5 districts.

While there is no confirmed case of EVD in Uganda, preparedness activities are in high gear, such as active surveillance, risk communication, collection and testing of samples, and construction and equipping of Ebola treatment units in high-risk districts, including Kampala and Wakiso districts, to treat possible cases.

Health workers hope that the above system, with the active participation of all people, will promptly detect incidents of people sneaking into the country from EVD outbreak areas and appropriately handled. If they sneak in and fall sick, the system is ready to isolate and treat them or handle any other eventuality.

[While it is great detective work to have found these 2 individuals, it is fortunate they were not infected as they made their way from Katwa to a suburb of Kampala, Uganda. They could have infected many contacts en route.

-Fri 1 Feb 2019. Protecting those on the frontline from Ebola
[Eueka Alert, edited]
https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2019-02/muos-pto020119.php

In a world where we can travel the globe by jet, diseases that were once thought to plague faraway places can now strike close to home. The USA had to learn this the hard way. In 2014, a patient harboring Ebola returned home to Dallas, Texas, from Liberia. Within 15 days of this person's arrival, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had confirmed 2 secondary cases in nurses who were treating the infected patient.

Ebola virus is very easily contracted from body fluids -- a mere 10 viral particles will do it -- and people who get it have up to a 78% chance of dying. Healthcare workers are among the most vulnerable.

According to a 2015 report by the World Health Organization, healthcare workers can have an infection rate up to 32 times higher than the general population in certain parts of the world. Infected healthcare workers can unknowingly spread the disease and, once sick, are unable to care for patients.

In addition to a human toll, Ebola also exacts an economic one. Treatment of an Ebola patient in the USA can range from USD 30 000 - USD 50 000 per day, limiting the number of hospitals who can treat it, and making its spread a very costly problem.

The best hope for controlling this lethal foe is to prevent it. Researchers at the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) have created an online software package via the SmartState spin-off company, SimTunes, LLC, to train healthcare workers using simulation in safe Ebola disease response. They report promising findings in a small cohort of MUSC healthcare workers in an article published in the December 2018 issue of Health Security.

"This training program takes information from multiple resources, including the CDC, the National Ebola Training and Education Center, and the European Network for Infectious Diseases," says Lacey MenkinSmith, M.D., assistant professor of Emergency Medicine at MUSC and 1st author of this article. "What makes the program unique is that it combines all that information into one training program that is widely distributable."

"The entire course, including background material and hands-on simulation practice, is delivered over the internet, so people can be trained immediately," adds Jerry G. Reves, M.D., distinguished professor and emeritus dean of the College of Medicine at MUSC and principal investigator of the CDC-funded study.

The software package includes a self-study component, a "hands-on" simulation workshop, and a data-driven performance assessment toolset. A post-test evaluates trainees' knowledge of Ebola treatment, and software tracks and scores individual and team performance in Ebola treatment scenarios.

This training package aims to reduce the number of critical errors and risky actions committed when treating an Ebola patient. Critical errors put an individual at risk of infection or contaminate the clean zone. Risky actions increase the chance of committing a critical error.

The researchers tested the usefulness of their software package in 18 healthcare workers at MUSC, a state treatment center for Ebola. The healthcare workers were divided into 2 groups based on their experience level with treating high-risk infectious disease. The software package increased the knowledge of both groups about effective prevention by up to 19%.

Both groups also performed extremely well in simulation scenarios, with only 2.3% of 341 total steps flagged for critical errors in both groups. These scenarios included cleaning up spills, putting on a biosuit correctly, and properly responding to a needle stick. Practicing all of these scenarios helps to reduce the risk of infection of the healthcare workers treating the Ebola patient. These results validate this software package as a way to streamline and adequately educate healthcare workers on proper techniques to reduce infection when treating an Ebola patient.

The MUSC team plans next to test their training program in other healthcare settings relevant to Ebola. These include community hospitals, where Ebola patients might 1st be seen, or intermediary hospitals, which would care for them until they could be sent to a treatment center like MUSC.

MenkinSmith, who specializes in global emergency medicine, would also like to test the program in developing countries, and is planning to use the course in Uganda.

"I want to see how we can adapt what we have to a place that is a low-resource healthcare setting, such as a site like Uganda, that I am set to visit," says MenkinSmith. Uganda's neighbor, the Democratic Republic of Congo, is currently experiencing an Ebola outbreak.

"Instituting this training at various universities and hospitals across the world will take time and adjustments," says Reves. "However, this represents the beginning of a concrete way to ensure that healthcare workers are protected from Ebola with just-in-time training anywhere in the world."
