Arcadia Trading Inc. of Brooklyn, New York, is recalling all packages of Red Thread Fish because they are uneviscerated. The product comes in a 7 oz. heat sealed plastic bag. The recalled Red Thread Fish was distributed nationwide in supermarkets. Consumers are warned not to use the product even if it does not look or smell spoiled.

The potential for contamination was noted by New York State Department of Agriculture inspectors during a routine inspection and subsequent analysis of product by Food Laboratory personnel confirmed that the fish was not properly eviscerated prior to processing. The sale of uneviscerated processed fish is prohibited under New York State Agriculture and Markets regulations because _Clostridium botulinum_ spores are more likely to be concentrated in the viscera than any other portion of the fish. Uneviscerated fish have been linked to outbreaks of botulism poisoning.

Symptoms of botulism poisoning include blurred or double vision, general weakness, and poor reflexes, difficulty swallowing and respiratory paralysis.

No illnesses have been reported to date in connection with this problem.

Because of the potential severity of botulism, ProMED-mail posts such recalls even if, as in this case, there are no human cases associated (yet) with the food products. Most of the food recalls are related to defective preparation procedures, which could, but do not necessarily, result in the germination of viable spores of _Clostridium botulinum_. - Mod.LL]
