The outbreak of JE [Japanese encephalitis] in Jharkhand has been confirmed by positive blood sample testing of the patients for JE virus.

The disease surveillance programme for the district has been intensified and activities like awareness camps about disease cause and symptoms and early reporting to hospital in case of fever have been undertaken. Likewise, vector control by district municipal services is being undergone.

Pig owners are instructed to keep pig sties clean as mosquitoes breed there and pig act as source of infection.

Testing for JE virus is undergone at NARI [National AIDS Research Institute], Pune.
