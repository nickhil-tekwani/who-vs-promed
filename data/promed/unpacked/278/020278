Last year [2018] was tough for potato farmers in Plateau State, the country's main producer of potatoes. The rainy season aggravated the plight as blight, a potent potato disease, ravaged most farms. Crises and blight therefore led to a rapid rise in the cost of potato seeds [tubers].

Seeds were expensive in 2018 because [of] crises [making] farmers unable to harvest their crops [and] the ravaging potato blight during the rainy season. [For] seed imported from Holland, new varieties would have to be tested with the soil before it is sold to farmers. Most of the cheaper potato seeds could affect yield because they could either be diseased or they may likely produce very small potatoes.

There was potato scarcity [in 2018]. For most of the farmers, getting a lasting solution to potato blight and providing improved seeds would ensure better yield.

[Late blight of potato (PLB) and tomato is caused by the fungus-like organism (oomycete) _Phytophthora infestans_ and can cause 100 percent crop loss. The pathogen can also affect some other solanaceous crops. In potato, it affects leaves as well as tubers; in tomato, it causes lesions and rotting of leaves, stems and fruits. The disease is favoured by cool, moist conditions. It can spread rapidly within a crop and destroy it within a few days. Under favourable conditions, epidemics in tomatoes may be even more rapid than in potatoes.

The pathogen is spread by plant material (including potato seed tubers, tomato transplants, plant debris, volunteer crop plants), mechanical means (including human and insect activities), wind and water. Disease management requires an integrated approach and may include removal of pathogen reservoirs, crop rotation, preventative fungicide treatments of planting material, as well as fungicide sprays of crops. Farm-saved or uncertified seed tubers have often been reported as sources of PLB outbreaks. Commercial crop cultivars vary in susceptibility to late blight. Development of resistant cultivars is being counteracted by the adaptability of the pathogen.

Certified clean planting stock and management strategies for fungicide resistance of the pathogen are considered vital to control late blight outbreaks. Seed tuber certification schemes have been set up in many countries. Considerable variation in aggressiveness between different pathogen strains has been observed, but more virulent strains with additional fungicide resistances and increased yield losses are emerging frequently. Late blight is considered an increasing problem worldwide.
