West Nile Virus Appears in Blue Jays in Tennessee
-------------------------------------------------
MEMPHIS: The Tennessee Department of Health announced today that 9 dead
birds found in Shelby County appear to be infected with West Nile virus,
according to preliminary tests. The birds, all blue jays found in zip code
areas 38117 and 38119, have been sent to the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention for confirmatory testing. This is the first time that West
Nile virus has been identified in Tennessee. No human cases have been
reported.
West Nile virus has been commonly found in Africa, Eastern Europe, West
Asia, and the Middle East, but did not appear in the U.S. until the early
summer of 1999. In the United States, there were 62 cases of West Nile
virus in humans in 1999, 21 in 2000, and 14 reported to date this year. So
far in 2001, a total of 19 states including Tennessee have now reported
West Nile virus, as well as Canada and Washington, DC. In the Southeast,
the virus has been detected in Virginia, Alabama, Kentucky, Georgia, and
Florida, though only Georgia and Florida have had human cases.
Health officials in Tennessee have been conducting surveillance activities
for West Nile Virus in humans, horses, and birds. Blue jays, crows, and
hawks have a high sensitivity to West Nile virus, so dead bird surveillance
is one of the ways health officials look for the disease.
