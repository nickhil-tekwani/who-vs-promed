From: Scott Ritchie <RITCHIES@health.qld.gov.au>

We have had an ongoing battle with the dreaded dengue 3 (DEN 3) virus since
December. Fighting tooth and nail, we have been able to "limit" it to 230
confirmed cases as of 4 August. However, we have been unable to put it
away. Like plugging holes in the leaky boat, we have had cases show up in
new areas as soon as we eliminate it from others. Interestingly, a
concurrent outbreak of DEN 2 virus, the "common" S. Pacific strain, was
eliminated within a month, while other outbreaks in N. Queensland have been
eradicated within 2-3 months of onset. This DEN 3 virus keeps one step
ahead of us, despite our use of interior spraying with pyrethroid
insecticides.
Other features of the outbreak include:
1. high virulence (ca. 20% hospitalised) and
2. clustering within households
The latter suggest that one mosquito is causing grief.
My questions to readers are:
1. Is anyone else having outbreaks with a pernicious, persistent DEN-3?
2. Are the attributes of virulence and persistence linked - (and by what
mechanism)?
3. Are there known hot strains of DEN-3 and is this typical of DEN-3.
4. Are there any enhanced control measures that have had to be used to
control unusually difficult to control strains?

[The intriguing questions Scott asks have been asked before but we hope
someone can answer them now, definitively. The only way they can be
answered is by a combination of molecular epidemiology and considerable
time in the field. - Mod.CHC
