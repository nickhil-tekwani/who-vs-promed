Students of the Faculty of Veterinary Sciences of the National University of Asuncion were infected with brucellosis and they accused the authorities of not having been warned in time. The disease has its origin in animals. A veterinary student reported in Monumental AM that 2 of her colleagues were infected with brucellosis, a disease caused by a bacterium present in horses, cows and goats.

According to their statements, the authorities of the Faculty were aware that the animals were sick and, although they made a notification, it only arrived 2 days later to the students. Meanwhile, the students continued their practices. So far only 2 of them have been infected, but this week [week of Sun 15 Oct 2017] tests will be done to other students to see if they are in the same condition.

In addition, the veterinary student said that several people bought products of animal origin from the Faculty so there is a concern that they might have been infected as well. They requested the National Service of Quality and Animal Health (Senacsa) supplies and to have the corresponding quarantine appropriately applied.

[Brucellosis (http://www.medicinenet.com/brucellosis/article.htm) is a disease that is thought to have existed since ancient times, as it was 1st described more than 2000 years ago by the Romans and Hippocrates. It was not until 1887 that a British physician, Dr David Bruce, isolated the organism that causes brucellosis from several deceased patients from the island of Malta. This disease has had several names throughout its history, including Mediterranean fever, Malta fever, Crimean fever, Bang's disease, and undulant fever (because of the relapsing nature of the fever associated with the disease).

The symptoms and signs of brucellosis may develop from days to months after the initial exposure to the organism. While some individuals may develop mild symptoms, others may go on to develop long-term chronic symptoms. The signs and symptoms of brucellosis are extensive, and they can be similar to many other febrile illnesses, so recognition of potential exposure -- from ingestion of unpasteurized milk or cheese, employment as a veterinarian or veterinary student, in a slaughter house or meat processing plant, or working in a microbiology lab -- is vital. In this outbreak, it is not clear what symptoms the students had or whether they were just seropositive. ProMED would like more information about this episode.

The City of Asunción, Ciudad de Asunción (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asunción), is an autonomous capital district, not a part of any department. The metropolitan area, called Gran Asunción, includes the cities of San Lorenzo, Fernando de la Mora, Lambaré, Luque, Mariano Roque Alonso, Ñemby, San Antonio, Limpio, Capiatá, and Villa Elisa, which are part of the Central Department. The Asunción metropolitan area has around 2 million inhabitants. - Mod.LL

While the posting does state horses can acquire the disease, brucellosis in horses should be noted is not a frequent occurrence. Horses can pass the disease to humans, but it is rare. - Mod.TG
