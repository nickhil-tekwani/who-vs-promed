1st Report of Citrus tristeza virus in the State Union of Serbia and
Montenegro.
-------------------------------------------------
T. Papic, Ministry of International Economic Relations, Mihajla
Pupina 2, 11000 Belgrade, Serbia and Montenegro; and C. Santos and G.
Nolasco, CDCTPV, Universidade do Algarve, Campus de Gambelas,
8005-139 Faro, Portugal. Plant Dis. 89:434, 2005; published on-line
as DOI: 10.1094/PD-89-0434B. Accepted for publication 18 Jan 2005.
Citrus production in the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro has a
strategic importance to the agricultural sector. Approximately 400
000 trees are now grown in the major citrus producing region, which
is the Montenegrin Coastal Region. Satsuma mandarins and lemons
grafted on _Poncirus trifoliata_ are the most cultivated varieties.
In December 2003, 8 samples taken from the coastal region close to
the towns of Bar and Ulcinj were analyzed using enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with SP7 antibodies produced at
Universidade do Algarve, Portugal (3). Further analysis was done
using immunocapture-reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction
(IC-RT-PCR) targeting the entire coat protein (CP) gene (forward
primer CTV1: 5(prime)-ATGGACGACGAAACAAAGAA-3(prime) and reverse
primer CTV10: 5(prime)-ATCAACGTGTGTTGAATTTCC-3(prime)). Using both
techniques, 7 of 8 samples analyzed were found to be infected by
Citrus tristeza virus (CTV), including samples from 5 trees that
exhibited chlorosis, gummosis, and fruit deformation, and 2 trees
that were symptomless.
When analyzed using agarose gel electrophoresis, PCR products from
the positive samples consisted of a single amplicon of the expected
size for the CP gene compared with a positive control. The PCR
products of 2 samples were TA cloned (pGEM-T Easy Vector; Promega,
Madison, WI) in _E. coli_ cells and the CP inserts were analyzed
using single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) and DNA
sequencing. In both cases, the SSCP analysis of several clones showed
a variety of different patterns, suggesting the occurrence of
infections with a mixture of genomic variants.
Sequence analysis of different variants showed a CP gene with 669
nucleotides having greater than 90 percent nucleotide identity to
most CTV CP gene sequences available in GenBank. A genomic variant
(GenBank Accession No. AY764154) was closely related (98.5 percent
nucleotide identity) to the T30 mild strain from Florida (GenBank
Accession No. AF260651). However, other sequences obtained showed
only 93 percent nucleotide identity with this variant and were
closely related to other CP gene sequences obtained from Croatian
isolates.
A previous report (1) refers to the existence of CTV-infected Satsuma
plants illegally introduced in Italy from the former Yugoslavia. The
presence of CTV in the former Yugoslavia was later confirmed (2) but
in a region that became part of the Croatian Republic.
To our knowledge, this is the 1st report of CTV in the State Union of
Serbia and Montenegro, although a relationship with Croatian isolates
cannot be excluded. Although a very small number of samples were
analyzed in this study, CTV appears to be very common in the Satsuma
orchards. This could be due to the traditional use of the trifoliate
rootstock that prevents the appearance of tristeza decline, thus
enabling the unnoticed propagation of infected material. Because the
kind of symptoms observed in 5 trees are not typical of CTV and 2
infected trees were symptomless, the virus is probably not
responsible for the symptoms observed in the field.

[Citrus tristeza (CTV) is one of the most economically important
diseases of citrus worldwide, causing severe damage to most citrus
cultivars and varieties. CTV is aphid-transmitted by several vector
species, depending upon the region. Important species are _Toxoptera
citricidus_ (brown citrus aphid), _Aphis gossypii_ (melon and cotton
aphid), and _Aphis spiraecola_ (=_citricola_, green cotton aphid).
Species composition and seasonal occurrence vary in different
countries and regions. _T. citricidus_ is not found in the
Mediterranean area or North America, while _A. spiraecola_ invaded
the Mediterranean region in the 1960s and has become a serious citrus
pest there. _T. aurantii_ is not a major species, although it is
abundant on tea in Japan (Komazaki et al. 1985). The most efficient
vector is _Toxoptera citricidus_. This Old World species has been in
South America for some years and reached Central America in 1989 and
has been spreading through Central America and the Caribbean since
then.
Symptom expression in citrus hosts is extremely variable and depends
on the environment, the host and the virus isolate. Mandarins in
general are tolerant to CTV and rarely show any symptoms. Sweet
orange, sour orange, rough lemon and Rangpur lime are normally
symptomless but will react to some severe CTV isolates. Limes,
grapefruit, some pummelos, Citrus macrophylla, and some citrus
hybrids will react to CTV infection. Symptoms of CTV infection can
include total tree collapse, stunting, stem pitting, leaf cupping,
vein clearing, chlorosis and reduced fruit size.
Budwood testing negative for CTV is important in preventing primary
infections of tristeza in CTV-free areas as well as the introduction
of new perhaps more severe isolates in areas where the disease is
already present. Detection and disease eradication or suppression has
been effective in areas where low levels of infection prevail. Where
orchards planted with sweet orange on sour orange rootstocks are
declining, they should be replanted using CTV-tolerant rootstocks
such as rough lemon, Rangpur lime, trifoliate orange, trifoliate
orange hybrids of mandarins. Use of mild strain cross-protection may
be a viable option for control.
