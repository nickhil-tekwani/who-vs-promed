Michigan State Veterinarian Stephen Schmitt was cited as saying that bovine
tuberculosis that has infected white-tailed deer in Michigan and threatens
to depress the state's cattle industry has spread to
raccoons and coyotes, adding that two raccoons and five coyotes have tested
positive for bovine TB.
Schmitt says the wild animals probably contracted the disease by eating
deer carcasses.
The disease recently was discovered in one cow on an Alpena County farm,
prompting the U.S. Department of Agriculture to suspend Michigan's status
as a bovine TB-free state. Removing the status altogether would depress
cattle prices.

[It strikes me as odd that it is claimed that raccoons would be scavenging
deer carcasses. "Tested positive" can mean many things these days ...
positive on necropsy?, positive on ELISA serology?, skin-test? Are the
raccoon and coyote isolates identical on PCR with the local deer strains?
Maybe someone in Michigan can enlighten us as to the circumstances
surrounding this report. - Mod.MHJ
