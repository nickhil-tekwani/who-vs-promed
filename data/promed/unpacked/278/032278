Serological survey in migratory & resident birds of Galinhos/Rio
Grande do Norte for detection of West Nile and other viruses.
Francisco Anilton Alves Araujo - SVS/MS (Ministry of Health, Brazil)
et al. 2004
-----------------------------------------------
From 22 Apr to 3 May 2003, during their South-North migration, 711
birds of 23 species were captured, mostly adults and mostly shore
birds, but including 12 birds of 6 resident species. Most were bled
for West Nile Virus (WNV) serology, and cloacal swabs were pooled and
tested for virus isolation for Newcastle disease and avian influenza
viruses.
No evidence of the circulation of WNV was found by inoculation of
infant mice with 297 bird blood samples and 65 bird viscera. No
antibodies to WNV were detected in 503 bird sera tested by
hemagglutination-inhibition (HI); 7 of those had HI antibody to
Cacipore, Eastern equine encephalitis, Mayaro & Oropouche arboviruses.
388 cloacal swabs from 11 species of wild birds were combined into 22
pools (5-20 specimens per pool). Avian influenza viruses, all low
pathogenic type H3, were isolated from 13 pools of shore birds, most
of them _Calidris pusilla_, but also from _Columbina_ sp.,
_Pluvialis squatarola_, _Charadrius semipalmatus_, _Calidris
fuscicollis_, & _Arenaria interpres_, all migrants. One _C. pusilla_
had been banded in the USA.
Newcastle disease virus, pathogenic type APMV-1, was isolated from
the cloacal swabs of 2 pools of _A. interpres_ and 3 of _C. pusilla_;
all those pools also yielded avian influenza H3 virus.

[This report complements the one posted previously (see ref. below).
Rio Grande do Norte state is in the North-east of Brazil, on the
bulge into the Atlantic, last landfall for north-bound coastal
migrants before crossing the Caribbean to Florida. Rio Grande do Sul
state, where the south-bound birds were captured later in 2003, is
down around 30 degrees South latitude. 6 (H) subtypes (H1, H2, H3,
H5, H7, & H9) have been isolated in the past from humans. It is
interesting to note that only H3 virus was found in these north-bound
migrants, whereas no H3, only H2 & H4, were isolated from the
south-bound ones. But this may be only a statistical freak due to
the small numbers involved. - Mod.JW]
