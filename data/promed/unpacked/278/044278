6 more persons died due to this mysterious disease leading to a total
toll of 36 persons. All of them were children except 5 [presumably
this refers to 5 out of the total of 36 persons - Mod.MPP]. Senior
health personnel said scorching summer heat might be a contributory
factor. Investigations are ongoing.

West Bengal doctors fight mystery disease
-----------------
Panic-stricken parents on Saturday crowded makeshift health centres
in a central West Bengal district where a mysterious disease has
reportedly killed 32 children over 10 days. A team of doctors sent
from here to the Lalgola block of Murshidabad district, some 200 km
to the north, treated scores of children in makeshift camps that have
been swamped by anxious parents clutching their ailing babies.
An unknown disease spreading though 5 villages in Lalgola has
reportedly killed at least 32 children, but West Bengal's health
services director Prabhakar Chatterjee has put the toll at 19.
Health officials working in the affected areas say they cannot
pinpoint the exact death toll, because many deaths in remote places
could be going unreported. Death figures from independent sources in
Kulgachi, Kadamtala, Kurchidanga, Natundiyar, and Jagarpara villages,
where the disease has been reported, totalled 32. All the victims
were under 5 years [old].
About 250 children, many of who were being treated in the makeshift
medical centres, were showing symptoms of the strange disease like
high fever, salivation, and convulsions. Doctors, who suspect the
case to be bronchopneumonia, are assessing whether the ailment is
contagious. "Nothing can be said till we have the test reports of the
patients," Chatterjee said.
Chatterjee had earlier said the summer heat could have been a cause
for the sudden deaths among children. Murshidabad has witnessed
average maximum temperature of around 40 degrees Celsius this summer.

This sounds very much like strychnine intoxication. If it is, the
treatment would be to prevent seizures with diazepam and to provide
ventilatory support. Neuromuscular blockade may be necessary.

[According to the most recent update provided by Dr. Das of Kolkata,
there have been another 6 deaths since yesterday's report. There is
also mention that 5 of the deaths were in adults and additional
mention that there may be a relationship to the ongoing heat wave in
Southern India. According to the newswire report [2] temperatures
have been 40 degrees celsius daily for the past 2 weeks. The
symptoms described above could be compatible with extreme heat, which
can lead to extremely high body temperatures, rapid shallow
breathing, and mental status changes associated with severe
dehydration.
Dr. Weinstein's suggestion that the symptoms are consistent with
strychnine intoxication also merits consideration, though the high
temperatures generally follow the onset of the seizure activity
rather than precede them. In yesterday's posting there was the
suggestion that the high fever was simultaneous with or preceded the
central nervous system symptoms. We await more information on the
result of the ongoing investigation. - Mod.MPP]
[Background on Strychnine poisoning: Strychnine is an alkaloid
extract obtained from the dried ripe seeds of _Strychnos nux vomica_,
a small tree of the East Indies. In the past strychnine has been used
as an antiseptic, stomach tonic, circulatory stimulant, central
nervous system stimulant, and as a medication for the relief of
constipation.
The clinical signs of strychnine poisoning relate to its effects on
the central nervous system. The first clinical signs include
uneasiness, restlessness, anxiety, muscle twitching, and stiffness of
the neck. The animal/person is in severe pain and the pupils are
dilated. These signs can resemble those of tetanus, with an increase
in spinal reflexes leading to tonic convulsions characterized by
sudden contractions of all striated muscles followed by complete
relaxation
A tentative diagnosis can be made based on clinical signs and
history. However, a positive diagnosis can be made only by
identifying strychnine in the stomach contents and viscera. The drug
can be identified by chemical tests and microscopic identification of
typical strychnine crystals.
Strychnine is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract
(mainly from the intestine), nasal passages, or from injection sites
and attacks the central nervous system. Effects usually begin within
15 to 30 minutes. Occasionally there is a delay of 1 hour if it is
taken by mouth, as the time of action depends on whether the stomach
is empty or full, and on the type of food that is eaten.
Symptoms start after about 15 - 30 minutes after taking a lethal dose:
1. Initial symptoms are tightness and twitching of the muscles,
agitation, and hyperreflexia.
2. Stiffness of the body.
3. Lockjaw.
4. Frothing of the mouth.
5. Cessation of respiration.
6. Tetanus-like attacks every 10 - 15 minutes.
7. Severe cyanosis, which disappears after the attack subsides.
8. The attacks (each lasting about 3 - 4 minutes) appear to be
spontaneous, while at other times they are the result of external
stimuli, i.e., noises, slight movements, or flashes of light. The
patient never loses consciousness.
9. When the poisoning is left untreated, each attack lasts longer
than the previous one and the interval between them grows shorter.
10.Up to 10 attacks occur before death or recovery. This could happen
from 10 minutes to 3 hours and is a result of asphyxiation or inner
tissue paralysis.
The lethal dose for adults varies. The minimal oral lethal dose
ranges from 30 to 120 mg, but this can be somewhat lower when given
intravenously or subcutaneously. However, enzymes of hepatic
microsomes readily metabolize strychnine, so 2 lethal doses can be
given over 24 hours and not have cumulative effects. Of course,
lethal doses for children may be much lower.
Treatment consists of controlling the seizures with intravenous
diazepam. Once seizures are controlled, unabsorbed strychnine can be
removed from the stomach by gastric lavage. - Mod.TG]
