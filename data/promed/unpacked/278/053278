Nearly 90 para-military troopers are suffering from malaria in
Dantewada and Bijapur districts. They have been deployed in one of
the most difficult hilly terrains of Chhattisgarh to take on the
Maoists, but they are fighting malaria instead.

"This is not for the 1st time that a large number of malaria cases
have been reported from cops deployed in forested Bijapur and
Dantewada. In fact, 22 Naga and Mizo policemen died of the disease in
2006, while 7 were casualties in Maoist attacks during the period," a
source said.

He said: "These 88 cases among CRPF (Central Reserve Police Force)
men, including 40 cops of 55th battalion, have been confirmed. We
believe dozens more have been infected and have advised them to go
for immediate check up if they have the symptoms."

Troopers based in school complexes, close to thick forested belts,
have also been asked to use mosquito nets.

[In the just published "World Malaria Report 2008" from the WHO
<http://www.who.int/malaria/wmr2008> (see page 75),
Chhattisgarh is marked as an endemic area with an annual incidence in
the population of 1-100 malaria cases per 1000 population per year,
predominantly _P. falciparum_. We do not know how many CRPF personnel
have been exposed to malaria, so we cannot estimate the rate of
infection. It must be assumed that the soldiers have not received
chemoprophylaxis.
