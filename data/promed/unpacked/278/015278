A Sumter County woman who became South Carolina's 1st case of human
rabies in more than 50 years has died, according to the coroner. The
Sumter Coroner Havrin Bullock said the 46-year-old woman died from
complications from rabies. Officials believes she had been bitten by a
bat.

On Fri 16 Dec 2011, the State Department of Health and Environmental
Control (DHEC) announced the case. "We are deeply saddened to report
that a middle-aged woman from Sumter County has contracted rabies
virus infection," said Eric Brenner, MD and medical epidemiologist
with DHEC's Bureau of Disease Control. "There are only about 1-3 cases
of human rabies each year in this country. Tragically, rabies almost
always ends in death."

According to Dr. Brenner, almost all rabies infections occur as the
result of a bite that introduces infected saliva into the fresh wound.
"In this instance, we believe it's likely she was bitten by a bat that
entered her home a few months ago," Dr. Brenner said. "The rabies
virus travels slowly through the body until it reaches the brain and
central nervous system and produces serious initial symptoms including
headache, difficulty swallowing, seizures, anxiety, agitation and
confusion. Most patients die within a few weeks after the onset of
these symptoms." DHEC says that in adherence with agency procedures,
they will conduct an investigation to determine whether anyone else
might have been exposed to the virus.

The investigation will include members of the patient's family,
friends, co-workers, healthcare providers and others who had been in
close contact with her in the weeks before she developed symptoms. "It
is important to note that person-to-person transmission of rabies has
never been documented, with the exception of special circumstances in
medical settings," Dr. Brenner said. "Exposure to the blood of an
infected person is not considered a reason to be treated for rabies."

According to Dr. Brenner, bites from infected bats are one of the most
common forms of exposure to humans. Unfortunately, bat bites can be
tiny and often go undetected. Other animals in South Carolina that
typically can be infected with the virus include raccoons, foxes,
skunks and other wild animals. Unvaccinated dogs and cats can also
become infected with rabies virus. South Carolina law requires all
dogs, cats, and ferrets to be vaccinated against rabies virus in order
to protect the pets and the people around them. "If you find a bat
inside your home, don't release it outside," Dr. Brenner said. "Do not
touch the bat with your bare hands. Trap it under a container and
contact your county DHEC environmental health office to have the bat
tested for rabies. If the bat is found outside on the ground, don't
touch it. And if a pet comes in contact with a bat, the bat should be
trapped under a container and you should call your county DHEC
environmental health office to have the bat tested for rabies."

[This report confirms that the 46-year-old woman presumed to have
contracted rabies as a result of contact with a bat (assumed but not
confirmed to have been be rabid) some months ago has died as a result
of rabies virus infection. Previously notification of her death had
been withheld in accordance with a legal restriction (see: Rabies -
USA (11): (SC) bat, human 20111217.3617). This incident is the 1st
fatal human case of rabies in South Carolina for 50 years. The risk of
casual contact with bats as a source of rabies virus infection
deserves wider publicity.
