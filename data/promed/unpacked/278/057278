Germany's battle with what now rates as Germany's worst ever outbreak
of enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ infection hit a new level today [27 May
2011] with the announcement of a record number of patients suffering
life-threatening complications.

Attempting to forestall anticipated deaths, doctors in the north
German cities in which the outbreak is centred have set up a
spontaneous clinical trial for an experimental antibody drug called
eculizumab (Soliris; Alexion), recently listed by Forbes as the
world's most expensive.

Rolf Stahl, head of the nephrology clinic at the Hamburg-Eppendorf
University Hospital, and Reinhard Brunkhorst, president of the German
Society of Nephrology, are rolling out an emergency eculizumab
treatment strategy to hospitals across the country.

The drug is currently used to treat a rare disorder of the immune
system called paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, and a year's
treatment costs more than USD 400 000. But just this week, a study
published in the New England Journal of Medicine reported successful
use of the drug in treating 3 patients with HUS (1). The drug's
manufacturer, Alexion, is now providing eculizumab free of charge in
Germany, taking advantage of an unexpectedly large cohort of patients
that might help to speed the drug's approval for the treatment of
HUS.

Eculizumab targets a member of the immune system's complement pathway
called complement 5. Complement proteins are activated by the Shiga
toxin produced by EHEC and are an important component of the immune
response to infections. But over-activity of complement proteins,
which scientists think occurs in HUS, can lead to tissue damage,
particularly in the kidneys. "By blocking complement using eculizumab,
we saw a dramatic improvement in the patients' blood-cell counts and
kidney function," says Michael Kirschfink at the University of
Heidelberg, a co-author on the New England Journal of Medicine paper
(1).

Brunkhorst and his team at Hanover Medical School are already
treating 8 patients with eculizumab, and other hospitals are expected
to rapidly follow suit. "But we don't want to be overly optimistic,"
he cautions. "We have very little experience with this drug and don't
know how effective it will be."

[The letter to the editor, also communicated by Axel Pettinger, is
shown below http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc1100859:

Hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS), a thrombotic microangiopathy, most
commonly occurs secondary to infection with Shiga-toxin-producing _E.
coli_ (STEC-HUS), although rare, atypical forms are associated with
abnormalities in complement-regulating proteins. The inhibition of
terminal complement complex formation by the monoclonal C5 antibody
eculizumab has recently been reported as a treatment for atypical HUS
(1).

We report on 3-year-old patients with severe STEC-HUS that required
hemodialysis. In Patient 1, plasma exchanges were performed because of
low C3 and elevated C3d serum concentrations, which suggested
complement activation. Plasma exchange was also performed in Patient 2
because of severe central nervous system involvement, a rare
complication that often leads to death or permanent neurologic damage
(2). Progressive involvement of the central nervous system developed
in both patients despite 5 consecutive days of plasma exchange.

Given the devastating prognosis, we administered eculizumab to these
2 patients, as well as to a 3rd patient with a similar disease course,
at 7-day intervals, twice in Patients 1 and 3 and 4 times in Patient
2. The neurologic status in all 3 patients improved dramatically
within 24 hours after the 1st eculizumab infusion. Clinical
improvement was associated with rapid normalization of markers of
disease activity: Platelet counts normalized, and lactate
dehydrogenase levels decreased within 5 days in all patients (Figure
1) [For figure, see original URL. - Mod.LL].

Dialysis was discontinued after 3 days in Patient 1, after 16 days in
Patient 2, and after 13 days in Patient 3, and the patients were
discharged with apparently normal neurologic status 9, 35, and 20
days, respectively, after the administration of the 1st dose of
eculizumab. Renal function fully recovered, with mild residual
proteinuria and hypertension in Patients 1 and 3. All patients have
remained in full remission for the past 6 months. Screening for
mutations in the genes encoding complement regulatory proteins (CFH,
CFI, MCP, C3, CFB, and THBD) and testing for anti-CFH antibodies were
negative in all patients.

In the cases reported here, spontaneous recovery seemed unlikely,
given the rapidly progressive course of the disease. The rapid
clinical response to eculizumab in all 3 children supports the concept
that Shiga toxin may activate complement directly (3), providing a
rationale for therapeutic complement blockade in STEC-HUS with severe
complications. Complement hyperactivation was recently demonstrated in
STEC-HUS (4), and a mutation in the complement-regulating gene MCP was
reported in a fatal case of STEC-HUS (5). The dramatic resolution of
symptoms after eculizumab administration in the cases reported here
suggests that STEC-HUS is an area deserving further careful
investigation of the risk-benefit ratio of therapeutic complement
blockade in this toxin-mediated vasculopathy.
