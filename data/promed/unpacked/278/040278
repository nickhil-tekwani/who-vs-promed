Defying the dire predictions of health officials, the flocks of
migratory birds that flew south to Africa last fall, then back over
Europe in recent weeks, did not carry the deadly bird flu virus or
spread it during their annual journey, scientists have concluded.
International health officials had feared that the disease was likely
to spread to Africa during the southward migration and return to
Europe with a vengeance during the reverse migration this spring.
That has not happened -- a significant finding for Europe, because it
is far easier to monitor a virus that exists domestically on farms
but not in the wild.
In thousands of samples collected in Africa this winter, the bird flu
virus, A(H5N1), was not detected in a single wild bird, health
officials and scientists said. In Europe, only a few cases have been
detected in wild birds since 1 Apr 2006, at the height of the
migration north. The number of cases in Europe has fallen off so
steeply compared with February 2006, when dozens of new cases were
found daily, that specialists contend that the northward spring
migration played no role.
The flu was found in one grebe in Denmark on 28 Apr 2006 -- the last
case discovered -- and a falcon in Germany and a few swans in France,
said the World Organization for Animal Health, based in Paris.
In response to the good news, agriculture officials in many European
countries are lifting restrictions intended to protect valuable
poultry from infected wild birds. Last week, the Netherlands and
Switzerland rescinded mandates that poultry be kept indoors. Austria
has loosened similar regulations, and France is considering doing so.
The cases in Europe in February were attributed to infected wild
birds that traveled west to avoid severe cold in Russia and Central
Asia but apparently never carried the virus to Africa. The
international scientists who had issued the earlier warnings are
perplexed, unsure if their precautions -- like intensive surveillance
and eliminating contact between poultry and wild birds -- helped
defuse a time bomb or if nature simply granted a reprieve.
"Is it like Y2K, where also nothing happened?" asked Juan Lubroth, a
senior veterinary official at the United Nations Food and Agriculture
Organization in Rome, referring to the expected computer failures
that did not materialize as 1999 turned to 2000. "Perhaps it is
because it was not as bad as we feared, or perhaps it is because
people took the right measures." Still, he and others say, the lack
of wild bird cases in Europe only underscores how little is
understood about the virus. And scientists warn that it could return
to Europe.
Specialists from Wetlands International, who were deputized by the
Food and Agriculture Organization, sampled 7500 African wild birds
last winter in a search for the disease. They found no A(H5N1), Mr.
Ward Hagemeijer said, so it is not surprising that it did not return
to Europe with the spring migration.
While bird flu has become a huge problem in poultry on farms in a few
African countries, including Egypt, Nigeria and Sudan, specialists
increasingly suspect that it was introduced in those countries
through imported infected poultry and poultry products. Mr.
Hagemeijer said the strength of the virus among wild birds possibly
weakened as the southward migration season progressed, a trait he
said was common in less dangerous bird flu viruses. That probably
limited its spread in Africa, he said.
Many bird flu viruses are picked up by migratory birds in their
nesting places in northern lakes during the summer and fall breeding
season. As the months pass, the viruses show a decreasing pattern of
spread and contamination. "So it tends to be mostly a north-to-south
spread, and then it wanes," Mr. Hagemeijer said.
Still, this means that the cycle could start again this summer, if
the virus -- which can live for long periods in water -- has
persisted in those breeding areas. Many bird specialists contend that
a small number of wetland lakes in Central Asia and Russia may harbor
the virus all the time, serving as the origin of European and Central
Asian infections. Scientists still do not know which [wild] birds
carry the virus silently and which die from it quickly, or how it
typically spreads from wild bird to wild bird, or between wild birds
and poultry.
Farm-based outbreaks of bird flu still occur constantly in a number
of countries, although not in Europe. Ivory Coast had its first
outbreak of bird flu, on a farm, last week. But other countries, like
Turkey, have made substantial progress in containing the disease
among poultry, Mr. Lubroth said.
After the virus was found on farms in Nigeria in January 2006, many
specialists expected it to spread rapidly among farms and into wild
birds in the region. Apparently, it did not. "Why didn't it sweep up
the coast from Niger, to Benin and Senegal and back up through
Europe? Why didn't it hit Africa's big lakes?" Mr. Lubroth asked.
"All we have are a few snapshots of the virus. What we need is a
movie of its life cycle."

Without wishing to cause controversy, I think the comments by the moderator
at the end of "Avian influenza - worldwide (110): Djibouti, susp." give the
appearance of being somewhat contentious. They seem to combine the lack of
finding H5N1 in migrating birds returning from Africa with the occurrence of
H5N1 in Djibouti, querying the latter finding because of the former. This is
perhaps a little premature. Yes, migrating birds move through the Horn of
Africa. But that does not mean they are the source of the infection as the
moderator seems to imply. Equally possible could be trade in domestic
poultry in all their varied glory or even the trade in exotic wild birds or
birds or prey. I think it is important to keep all possible sources in mind
until investigations are undertaken and completed.

[There is always the risk when there is a paradigm shift that the old
will not be investigated as enthusiastically as the new. Put another
way, if the working hypothesis is now that migratory birds play only
an incidental role, that data -- and especially negative data -- will
no longer be collected with as much enthusiasm. This can leave
everything up in the air and not nailed down, to mix my allegories.
It will be interesting to see what happens in the Alaskan migratory
bird study. - Mod.MHJ]
