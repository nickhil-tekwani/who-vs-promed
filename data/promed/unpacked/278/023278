Montgomery MP, Robertson S, Koski L, et al. Multidrug-resistant _Campylobacter jejuni_ outbreak linked to puppy exposure -- United States, 2016-2018
----------------------------------------------------------------------
_Campylobacter_ causes an estimated 1.3 million diarrheal illnesses in the USA annually (1). In August 2017, the Florida Department of Health notified CDC of 6 _Campylobacter jejuni_ infections linked to company A, a national pet store chain based in Ohio. CDC examined whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data and identified 6 isolates from company A puppies in Florida that were highly related to an isolate from a company A customer in Ohio. This information prompted a multistate investigation by local and state health and agriculture departments and CDC to identify the outbreak source and prevent additional illness. Health officials from 6 states visited pet stores to collect puppy fecal samples, antibiotic records, and traceback information. Nationally, 118 persons, including 29 pet store employees, in 18 states were identified with illness onset during 5 Jan 2016-4 Feb 2018. In total, 6 pet store companies were linked to the outbreak.

Outbreak isolates were resistant by antimicrobial susceptibility testing to all antibacterials commonly used to treat _Campylobacter_ infections, including macrolides and quinolones. Store record reviews revealed that among 149 investigated puppies, 142 (95%) received one or more courses of antimicrobials, raising concern that antibacterial use might have led to development of resistance. Public health authorities issued infection prevention recommendations to affected pet stores and recommendations for testing puppies to veterinarians. This outbreak demonstrates that puppies can be a source of multidrug-resistant _Campylobacter_ infections in humans, warranting a closer look at antimicrobial use in the commercial dog industry.

Epidemiologic investigation
---------------------------
Campylobacteriosis became a nationally notifiable condition in 2015, and many states routinely interview patients with campylobacteriosis [https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/conditions/campylobacteriosis/case-definition/2015/]. For this investigation, a standardized, supplemental questionnaire was used by state and local health departments to collect dog exposure information from persons with _Campylobacter_ infection who reported recent dog or pet store exposure during routine interview. A case definition relevant to this outbreak (Box) [for Box, Figure, and Table, see source URL above. - Mod.LL] was developed to aid in case finding and characterization.

By 28 Feb 2018, a total of 118 persons meeting the case definition for _Campylobacter_ infection, including 29 pet store employees, were reported from 18 states [Connecticut (2 patients), Florida (20), Georgia (5), Illinois (11), Kansas (7), Massachusetts (2), Maryland (5), Michigan (one), Missouri (2), New Hampshire (2), New York (2), Ohio (34), Oklahoma (1), Pennsylvania (6), Tennessee (2), Utah (4), Wisconsin (9), and Wyoming (3)]. Age was available for 115 persons and ranged from younger than 1 year to 85 years (median = 26 years); 74 of 115 (63%) infected persons were female. Among 107 persons for whom hospitalization information was available, 26 (24%) were hospitalized; no deaths occurred. In total, 105 of 106 (99%) infected persons reported dog exposure, including 101 (95%) who had contact with a pet store puppy (Table). 8 patients reported buying or having contact with puppies from five pet store companies other than company A (companies B-F), indicating that puppies became infected with _Campylobacter_ before reaching pet stores.

State and local health and agriculture departments in 4 states (Kentucky, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin) visited 20 pet stores and collected antimicrobial administration records for 154 puppies. Among 149 puppies with available information, 142 (95%) received one or more antibacterial courses before arriving or while at the store. Among 142 puppies that received antimicrobials, treatment indication was available for 134 (94%); 78 (55%) treated puppies received antibacterials for prophylaxis only, 54 (38%) for prophylaxis and treatment, and 2 (1%) for treatment only. Median treatment duration was 15 days (range = 2-67 days). 4 antibacterials (metronidazole, sulfadimethoxine, doxycycline, and azithromycin) accounted for 81% of all antibacterials administered (Figure). Use of broad-spectrum antimicrobials also was noted, including tetracyclines, quinolones, aminoglycosides, and chloramphenicol.

Laboratory investigation
------------------------
Stool specimens from infected persons or _Campylobacter_ isolates were submitted to state public health laboratories. Health and agriculture officials from 6 states (Florida, Kansas, Kentucky, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin) visited 29 pet stores (27 company A and 2 company B) to collect puppy fecal samples. All company A and B stores in Ohio were visited, and a convenience sample of stores in other states was selected. Some states also requested fecal samples from patient households that had purchased puppies. Human stool specimens and puppy fecal samples underwent _Campylobacter_ culture, and whole-genome multilocus sequence typing (wgMLST) was performed to compare genetic relatedness. Antibacterial susceptibility testing for 9 antimicrobials was performed by broth microdilution (Sensititer, Thermo Fisher Scientific) on selected isolates and interpreted using epidemiologic cutoff values established by the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing. In this report, "resistant" refers to isolates with non-wild-type results (2). To explore pet food as a possible source of _Campylobacter_ infection in puppies, dog food samples from company A and one person's home were collected for culture.

_C. jejuni_ isolates were obtained for 51 persons and 23 puppies. Outbreak isolates from 45 persons and 11 puppies grouped into 3 distinct clades by wgMLST. 6 persons whose illnesses did not meet the case definition because their isolates were unrelated by wgMLST were excluded. 12 puppy isolates were also unrelated to the outbreak by wgMLST. 2 clades contained isolates from persons and puppies that were genetically related (32 or fewer alleles differences within each clade). The 3rd clade contained 6 patient isolates that were related (30 or fewer alleles differences). 18 outbreak isolates (10 human and 8 puppy) representing all 3 clades were selected for susceptibility testing, and all were resistant to azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, erythromycin, nalidixic acid, telithromycin, and tetracycline. In addition, 16 of 18 isolates were resistant to gentamicin, and 4 of 18 were resistant to florfenicol. None of the cultures of 12 dog food samples yielded _Campylobacter_.

Traceback investigations
------------------------
Records, including microchip identification numbers of puppies when available, were collected for puppies owned by infected persons and those sampled in stores. Microchips are implanted subcutaneously, usually before the puppy arrives at the store, and their corresponding identification numbers allowed investigators to trace puppies back to their breeders and distributors. Distributors are companies that purchase puppies wholesale from breeders and sell them to pet stores and other locations. Additional transport information was collected from stores when available. Practices identified during records review indicated that pet store puppies travel from breeders to distributors to stores by 3rd-party transport companies. Information collected for 8 puppies owned by infected persons and 20 puppies with fecal samples that were positive for _C. jejuni_ traced back to 25 breeders and 8 distributors. No single breeder, distributor, or transporter was identified as the infection source. However, potential for _Campylobacter_ transmission among puppies exists because puppies from different breeders were commingled at distributors, during transport, and in stores.

Public health response
----------------------
CDC developed educational materials on campylobacteriosis prevention. CDC and states shared these with pet industry partners, including retail pet stores. Educational messages focused on handwashing, separating human eating areas from animal areas, and using personal protective equipment correctly, such as wearing gloves when cleaning cages in pet stores. CDC posted an outbreak advisory online, which included information for clinicians and veterinarians recommending culture and antibiotic susceptibility testing to guide antibiotic treatment decisions (3).

Discussion
-----------
Epidemiologic, laboratory, and traceback evidence indicates that puppies sold through the commercial dog industry, an uncommon source of _Campylobacter_ outbreaks, were the source of a multistate outbreak of multidrug-resistant _Campylobacter_ infections. This evidence, combined with the prolonged nature of the outbreak and the potential for puppy commingling, indicates a potential for continued transmission of multidrug-resistant _Campylobacter_ industrywide, including at breeders, distributors, transporters, and stores, and ultimately in customers' homes. Although the investigation is completed, the risk for multidrug-resistant _Campylobacter_ transmission to employees and consumers continues.

Dog-associated _Campylobacter_ outbreaks have been reported previously, but those outbreaks involved fewer illnesses, and the isolates were not multidrug-resistant (4-6). The investigation of this outbreak revealed widespread administration of multiple antibacterial classes, including all classes to which the outbreak. _Campylobacter_ strains were resistant. Hygiene and animal husbandry practices can reduce the need for antimicrobials and decrease transmission of _Campylobacter_ between animals and from animals to humans (7). Adherence to antimicrobial stewardship practices in these settings might reduce the selection of highly drug-resistant _Campylobacter_. Implementation of antimicrobial stewardship principles and practices in the commercial dog industry is needed.

Clinicians should consider that persons can acquire _Campylobacter_ infections, including multidrug-resistant infections, from puppies. If antimicrobials are indicated, consider stool culture and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Pet stores, commercial distributors, transporters, and breeders should ensure that existing biosecurity measures are sufficient to reduce ongoing risk for _Campylobacter_ transmission between puppies and humans. Pet stores should provide employee and customer education and training on handwashing and provide employees with personal protective equipment when cleaning animal areas (8). Educational information [https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/hygiene/etiquette/around_animals.html] that veterinarians and pet stores provide to pet owners could include information on reducing the risk for pathogen transmission. Finally, antimicrobials should only be administered under veterinary supervision with a valid veterinary-client-patient relationship, consistent with existing stewardship principles [https://www.avma.org/KB/Policies/Pages/Antimicrobial-Stewardship-Definition-and-Core-Principles.aspx].

Abstract
--------
_Campylobacter_ is regarded as a leading cause of human bacterial gastroenteritis in the USA. We report on a case of laboratory-confirmed _Campylobacter jejuni_ infection in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania among members of a household living with a laboratory-confirmed but non-speciated _Campylobacter_-infected puppy. We describe an outbreak of likely dog-associated campylobacteriosis, the risk factors, potential routes of exposure, and the clinical features in the exposed family members, which began shortly after exposure to the recently purchased dog. We also provide public health recommendations to prevent _Campylobacter_ infections in veterinary care providers, pet owners, and those planning to adopt pets in the future. Finally, this report underscores the importance of the One Health approach when public health responders, human and animal healthcare providers, and clinical diagnostic laboratories are tasked with developing effective strategies when investigating, detecting, and responding to zoonoses (diseases shared between animals and humans)." - Mod.LL
