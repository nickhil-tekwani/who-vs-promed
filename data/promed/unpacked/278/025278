Although California encephalitis [virus infection with actual clinical
disease
has been sporadically reported in horses (J Am Vet Med Assoc 1985 Feb
15;186(4):389 - horse lived), there are multiple reports in the
literature of asymptomatic equines seropositive for the California
serogroup; including from this general geographical area (see abstract
below). The horse has even been suggested as an excellent monitor for
virus activity in endemic areas.
West Nile Virus was conspicuously absent from the serology results
reported. Was this done?
Also, if these are single acute phase serum samples, wouldn't you expect
to see a more significant level of IgM? (Horse 2 is negative CE IgM.)
Titers as labeled are a little confusing. History for horse 1 says no
vaccinations, horse 2 vaccinated 6 months prior, at age 12 months,
against EEE (possibly even a combination EEE/WEE vaccine, as is commonly
used) yet horse 2 has much lower titers than horse 1, including to EEE.

Serologic evidence of Jamestown Canyon and Keystone virus infection in
vertebrates of the DelMarVa Peninsula.
Watts DM, LeDuc JW, Bailey CL, Dalrymple JM, Gargan TP 2d
Serological data accumulated during the past decade indicated a variety
of feral and domestic animals of the Delaware-Maryland-Virginia
(DelMarVa) Peninsula were infected with Jamestown Canyon (JC) and/or
Keystone (KEY)viruses (Bunyaviridae, California serogroup). Neutralizing
(N) antibody to JC virus was most prevalent in white-tailed deer, sika
deer, cottontail rabbits and horses.
KEY virus N antibody was detected most frequently in gray squirrels and
domestic goats. N antibody indicative of past infection by one or both
viruses was found in raccoons, horses and humans. JC and/or KEY virus N
antibodies were not demonstrable in sera of several other species of
small mammals and reptiles.
Investigations were extended to evaluate the role of domestic goats as an
amplifying host of JC and KEY viruses and to assess their potential as
sentinels of virus transmission. Goats maintained in the Pocomoke Cypress
Swamp during the summer season of 1978, acquired N antibodies to JC and
KEY viruses.
Following experimental inoculation with either JC or KEY virus, all goats
developed N antibody despite the absence of a demonstrable viremia in
most animals. Goats proved to be effective as sentinels for monitoring
the transmission of JC and KEY viruses; however, the exceptionally low
titers or absence of viremia following inoculation with these viruses
would seem to preclude a potential virus-amplifying role for this
species. Although findings implicated primarily gray squirrels and
white-tailed deer as possible amplifying hosts of KEY and JC virus,
respectively, further investigations will be required to clarify their
role, particularly since both viruses may be maintained entirely by
transovarial transmission.

California encephalitis virus activity in mosquitoes and horses in
southern Ontario, 1975.
Artsob H, Wright R, Shipp L, Spence L, Th'ng C
A study was undertaken in 1975 to determine California encephalitis virus
activity in southern Ontario. 3061 mosquitoes, primarily _Aedes_ species,
were divided into 104 pools and inoculated into suckling mice. Isolates of
snowshoe hare virus were obtained from one pool each of _Aedes fitchii_ and
_A. triseriatus_ mosquitoes collected in the
Guelph area. Serological testing of horse sera revealed extensive virus
activity in southern Ontario and indicated that horses may serve as
excellent monitors for California encephalitis virus.
