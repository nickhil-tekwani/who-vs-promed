Brazilian growers arm to fight Asian soy rust
------------------------------------------------
Soybean producers across Brazil have armed themselves this season in a
battle against possibly the biggest threat to their livelihood -- a
virulent strain of Asian soy rust caused by _Phakopsora pachyrhizi_.
"The whole state is worried," said head agronomist Andre Neves Santos at
the Moises Sachetti farms in Brazil's No. 1 soy state, Mato Grosso. "I've
been to 5 training seminars on how to identify and combat rust fungus in
the last few months."
According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Brazil will become the
world's No. 1 exporter of soy in 2003, displacing the USA. Experts agree
that Brazil's future leadership in soy production will depend on how well
it contains Asian rust, the most destructive soybean leaf disease, which
reduces yields by up to 80 percent.
Rust first showed up in Paraguay in 2001 and has since spread through
Paraguay, Brazil, Bolivia, and parts of Argentina. U.S. producers are
terrified at the possibility of the fungus reaching U.S. soy fields.
Of the main soy states affected last season, Mato Grosso suffered the most
because growers were caught off-guard, unconvinced it could travel so fast
across Brazil's massive 20-million-hectare soy belt.
"95 percent of producers in the state have already purchased all the
fungicide they expect to need this season," said Cristina Santos, who added
the cost of fungicide and its application would be expensive. Cost
estimates of soy experts are around $50 per hectare.
Rust showed up late in the growing cycle last season, reducing yield by 3
million tonnes off the 2002/03 crop, lowering Brazil's output to 52 million
tonnes, said Jose Tadashi Yorinori, Brazil's top soy rust expert at the
national plant research agency (Embrapa).
As Brazil enters the peak of a new Sept-Dec planting season, Mato Grosso
has already registered its first outbreaks of rust. "It began earlier this
year," said Yorinori. He said losses were pronounced in Mato Grosso and
Bahia last season because producers didn't identify the rust and spray soon
enough. But this is also a particularly virulent strain of rust.
Yorinori said tropical varieties of commercial soy seed that were
previously thought to have some rust resistance last season did not have
resistance to this virulent strain. Producers will have to rely largely on
fungicide until new rust-resistant strains are developed -- but that is
likely to take years.
Embrapa has identified one soy variety (BR-134) that is resistant to rust,
but it is not adapted to many growing regions in Brazil. Embrapa is working
with private sector firms to find and develop more resistant soy varieties.
For now, producers are betting on a tough spraying campaign to hold off the
disease.

[Soybean rust appeared in South America in 2001 and now occurs in
Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay. As of November 2002, USDA scientists had
screened 1000 of 4000 public and commercial soybean lines against a mixed
Pr population of 4 isolates from Zimbabwe, Thailand, Brazil, and Paraguay.
Most were susceptible, but a few show a resistant reaction type or reduced
numbers of lesions on infected leaves. Fungicides appear to be the only
workable disease management strategy at present. Several efficacy trials
are underway in Africa and South Africa to select candidate fungicides for
rust control. Only 2 effective fungicides are currently registered for use
in soybeans. In trials conducted outside the USA, 4 additional products
have been identified as effective against Pr, but are not currently
registered for use in soybeans. - Mod.DH]
