Officials with the Coastal Health District says a horse in West Chatham County tested positive for eastern equine encephalitis (EEE), a virus that is transmitted by infected mosquitoes.

Horses are susceptible to EEE and Chatham County Health Department Environmental Health officials are encouraging all horse owners to vaccinate their animals against the virus.

Eastern equine encephalitis is a mosquito-borne virus that can cause swelling of the brain. In horses, it is fatal 70 to 90 percent of the time according to health officials. [According to] district officials, horse and large animal owners are also encouraged to clean out watering sources, such as buckets and troughs, every 3-to-4 days to prevent mosquitoes from breeding there.

Health officials say although EEE infection in humans is rare, the finding of an EEE infection in a local horse is indicative of an increased risk to humans.

Coastal Health District officials say it is important to remember that mosquitoes are still active in coastal Georgia and the best way to prevent getting mosquito borne diseases is to keep from getting bitten by mosquitoes. Residents, particularly those that live near fresh water swamps, are encouraged to take precautions to minimize mosquitoes around property including regularly checking for and removing standing water from outside containers.

In addition:
- drain all standing water;
- Avoid dawn and dusk when mosquitoes are most active;
- Dress appropriately in long sleeves and pants;
- Defend or DEET yourself against mosquitoes with an effective repellent;
- Doors and windows should be in good condition

The hot, wet weather of early summer has produced a bumper crop of mosquitoes and deadly microbes.

The North Carolina Department of Agriculture [NCDA] reported last week [week of 16 Sep 013] that an even dozen horses have died of eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) this season [2013]. 10 had died by this time last year [2012].

The disease is carried by mosquitoes that bite infected horses, mules, donkeys, ponies, and miniatures. It can mutate into a deadly form of the disease that affects humans.

Dr Tom Ray of the NCDA said if the number of confirmed, reported cases has hit 12, "there are likely 4 or 5 times that many that aren't reported. "It's been a big year for EEE," he said.

The most recent case of EEE was in a quarter horse gelding that died in Bladen County. Ray said there was a flurry of cases earlier in the season, with 7 animals dying, then a lull, and now a steady climb has begun that could carry through until the 1st killing frost.

Public health officials say a horse from Ossipee [Carroll County] New Hampshire, has tested positive for eastern equine encephalitis.

A horse in Derry [Rockingham County] tested positive for the mosquito-borne disease last week [week of 16 Sep 2013]. The most recent finding, announced Tuesday [24 Sep 2013], raises the risk level for the town of Ossipee from "remote" to "high." The surrounding towns of Tamworth, Madison, Freedom, Effingham, Wakefield, Brookfield, Wolfeboro, Tuftonborough, and Moultonborough [Carroll County] will increase to a "moderate" risk level.

So far this season [2013], 13 mosquito batches have tested positive for West Nile virus and 20 have tested positive for EEE. One person in Chesterfield [Cheshire County] also has been diagnosed with West Nile virus.

Public health director Dr Jose Montero says people should protect against mosquito bites no matter where they live until there is a killing frost statewide.

[Eastern equine encephalomyelitis (EEE) is a mosquito-borne viral disease of all equine species such as horses, asses, and zebras. After infection, equines may suddenly die or show progressive central nervous system disorders.

Clinical signs in EEE-infected equines may include one or more of the following signs: fever; depression; anorexia (loss of appetite, not eating); weakness; central nervous system disorders (lack of coordination, chewing movements, head pressing, "sawhorse" stance, circling, paddling motion of the limbs, and convulsions); irritability and aggressiveness towards handlers; blindness; excitability; abnormal sensitivity to light and sound; in some cases, horses infected with EEE may show no clinical signs before dying.

The virus that causes EEE is transmitted primarily by mosquitoes that bite an infected animal [or bird] and then bite and feed on another animal or human. The speed with which the disease spreads depends on the density of mosquito populations.

There are fly and mosquito sprays for horses that are helpful in repelling the mosquitoes. However, the most effective prevention is vaccination. Vaccination usually comes in a combination vaccine for other viruses, such as West Nile virus (WNV) and western equine encephalitis (WEE). Vaccination is usually required to be repeated in 2-4 weeks for effective immunity. EEE immunity wanes rapidly and animals should be revaccinated approximately every 4-6 months depending upon location.

It should be emphasized that humans may contract this disease but only from mosquitoes. Equine owners cannot get the disease from their equine companions.
