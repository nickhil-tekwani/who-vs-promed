[Reportedly, the above cases showed FMD signs. The appearance of
clinical signs within a week of vaccination is not surprising;
animals may have been incubating when vaccinated, or infected before
immunity established. Hopefully, such cases will disappear during the
coming week, while the culling, preferably performed under strict
biosecurity conditions, advances. - Mod.AS]

Miyazaki to conduct final checks on 5 stud bulls
------------------------------------------------
The Miyazaki prefectural government said Friday [4 Jun 2010] it is
conducting final scientific checks on 5 top stud bulls of the
prefecture's cattle industry to see if they are infected with
foot-and-mouth disease [FMD].

The tests will be conducted at the Tokyo facility of the Tsukuba,
Ibaraki Prefecture-based National Institute of Animal Health, to
examine samples, taken from the bulls the same day, for the DNA of
the FMD virus or antibodies produced in reaction to the virus, it
said.

The samples including saliva were taken from the 5 bulls, which had
been transferred on 13 May 2010 to a refuge in the city of Saito from
a prefectural livestock center in Takanabe town.

The results of the DNA tests will be known on Saturday night [5 Jun
2010], while those of the antibody tests will be known on Sunday
night [6 Jun 2010].

Bans on livestock transfer lifted for part of Miyazaki
-----------------------------------------------------
The Miyazaki prefectural government said Thursday [3 Jun 2010] a
safety study has found no signs of FMD among animals in Ebino and
later lifted transfer bans on livestock in the city and vicinity,
though the spread of the contagious disease remains unlikely to stop
in other parts of the southwestern prefecture.

The bans on moving livestock within a 10-km [6.2-mile] radius from
the 4 disease-hit farms and on taking animals out of a 20-km
[12.4-mile] radius, which cover some areas in neighboring Kumamoto
and Kagoshima prefectures, was lifted midnight Thursday [3 Jun 2010],
officials said.

In the inland city, no animal has tested positive for the disease
since the last suspected infection case was confirmed 13 May 2010,
and the central and prefectural governments reached the conclusion at
the end of an 11-day safety study that began on 24 May 2010, they
said.

Since the disease broke out in Ebino on 28 Apr 2010, more than 600
cows and pigs have been slaughtered.

In the safety study, about 1300 cows at all the roughly 150 farms
located within a 3-km [1.86-mile] radius of the farms of origin have
been confirmed uninfected with the disease through antibody testing
of their blood samples, and so were pigs.

Since Monday [31 May 2010], some 97 000 cows and pigs at about 400
farms in a 3- to 10-km radius have had their condition visually
checked by veterinarians.

The prefectural government put the data together and consulted with
the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fishers before deciding on
lifting the bans, the officials said.

Media has it all wrong on foot-and-mouth outbreak
-------------------------------------------------
The epidemic is devastating Miyazaki's wagyu beef industry. As of 25
May 2010, by Shukan Post's [see comment] count, 148 000 cows and pigs
-- including 49 stud bulls -- had been slaughtered, with the toll
expected to rise to 300 000 before the dust settles.

Is this a natural disaster, or a human one? Akamatsu's [Hirotaka
Akamatsu, Japan's Minister of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries]
apology on 25 May 2010 suggests the latter, but what precisely he was
apologizing for was left vague, while Higashikokubaru [Hideo
Higashikokubaru, the governor of Miyazaki prefecture] seems to be
citing the prefecture's having been caught unawares as proof of
innocence. Shukan Post is not convinced.

First of all, it maintains, the Livestock Infectious Disease
Prevention Law assigns prevention responsibility not to the central
government but to the prefecture. Secondly, the supposed 1st act of
the Miyazaki drama, the 9 Apr 2010 discovery of a sick cow on a farm
in Tsuno Town, was not really the beginning after all; 10 days
earlier a water buffalo showed symptoms that should have warned of
what was in the wind. Thirdly, the mysterious spread of the disease
from Tsuno to Ebino, 70 km away, begs the question of a connecting
link, which the magazine claims to find in a company [name available,
unpublished, hence to be named 'The company'], owner of pasture land
in both places.

The sick cow noticed on 9 Apr 2010 caused no immediate alarm, but
when a 2nd cow owned by the same farmer showed similar symptoms a
week later, the farmer had tests performed, which on 20 Apr 2010
diagnosed FMD. Why, however, did a water buffalo's fever and
diarrhea, noted on 31 Mar 2010, fail to generate preventive measures?
[see comment]. The buffalo's FMD wasn't confirmed until 23 Apr 2010.
Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology professor Atsushi
Shirai, a specialist in livestock diseases, acknowledges that FMD is
hard to diagnose. He adds, however, that the notorious Taiwan
outbreak in 1997, which required a cull of 3.85 million pigs, should
have kept prefectural regulators more alert to the possibility [of
FMD?!] than they apparently were.

If the buffalo's symptoms had been correctly interpreted in time, the
ensuing catastrophe could have been averted [See comment].

'The Company,' Shukan Post's link between the 2 widely separated
centers of the outbreak, is a company that owns grazing land and
undertakes the pasturing of local farmers' livestock. "'The Company'
owns 15 pastures in Miyazaki Prefecture," the magazine hears from an
unnamed "local political insider."

[Though the above info, cited from the Japanese Weekly Shukan Post
(<http://www.weeklypost.com/100611jp/index.html>) sheds some light on
the early stages of the epizootic and its spread to a 70-km distant
western site, some ambiguity remains.

According to Japan's 1st, immediate report of 20 Apr 2010, FMD was
discovered on the farm 'Tsuno-cho Koyu-gun 2, Miyazaki', starting 07
Apr 2010, affecting 3 out of 16 susceptible cattle which were all
culled on 20 Apr 2010.

According to the follow-up report number 1, submitted 23 Apr 2010,
the 1st case had started already on 26 Mar 2010, in the farm
'Tsuno-cho Koyu-gun 1, Miyazaki'. The farm included 42 susceptible
buffaloes and 2 swine, among which only one case occurred (in a
buffalo). This case was diagnosed, by RT-PCR, on 23 Apr 2010, leading
to the culling of the entire farm's population (42 buffaloes and 2
swine) on 25 Apr 2010.

Objectively, a single, solitary sick water buffalo showing "fever and
diarrhea" is not usually expected to become subject to suspicion of
FMD and to "preventive measures taken," as the above article remarks.
It remains to be known if this animal showed other, more typical
signs, such as oral lesions or lameness. Even if some oral lesions
were seen, such (mucosal) signs could have been mistaken for a (rare)
complication of bovine virus diarrhea (BVD), a globally distributed
pestiviral disease. Additional details on the said buffalo, including
its age, will be helpful.

Most important, in particular for lessons to be drawn, is the
question: how and where from did the virus (which circulates in China
and South Korea) get into this Tsuno farm in the 1st place? - Mod.AS]
