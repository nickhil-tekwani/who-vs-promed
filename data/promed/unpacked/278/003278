The outbreak of leishmaniasis recorded in the capital [Corrientes]
since the beginning of the year [2011] continues to progress and this
week 3 new positive cases in dogs have been confirmed. In total, 57
dogs with leishmaniasis have been confirmed in the city of Corrientes
so far [in 2011].

The head of the Canine Leishmaniasis Program of the health
department, Alexis Burna, explained to El Litoral that health
authorities expect the number of cases to level off during the winter.
Nonetheless, people should remain vigilant because although
circulation of the vector diminishes with cold temperatures, winters
in the area are not very severe and cases could continue to appear. He
warns that the situation next summer [2011-2012] could be worse than
that of last summer.

The municipality, together with the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine of
the Universidad Nacional del Nordeste (Unne), will continue today [22
Jun 2011] with the free sterilization of dogs and cats in
neighborhoods in order to achieve a lower population of stray animals.
The team will also inform people about responsible pet ownership and
urge their collaboration in the fight against leishmaniasis.

Readers are encouraged to read the moderator's comment on ProMED-mail
post 20110323.0908 to learn more about leishmaniasis. It is to be
hoped that winter will be cold enough to cause a reduction in the sand
fly.

As the team sterilizes animals, let us hope they are also vaccinating
them against rabies. - Mod.TG]
