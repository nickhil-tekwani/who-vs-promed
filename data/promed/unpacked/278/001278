In May 2018, patient A, a previously healthy man aged 30 years, was evaluated at a District of Columbia (DC) health-care facility for a 4-day history of chills, diarrhea, fever (103 deg F [39.5 deg C]), headache, sore throat, and vomiting. Despite symptomatic treatment with antipyretics, he subsequently experienced hemoconcentration (hematocrit = 60.4% [normal = 38.8%-50%]), thrombocytopenia (<10,000 platelets/μL [normal = 150,000-450,000]), and acute kidney injury (blood urea nitrogen [BUN] = 95 mg/dL [normal = 9-20] and creatinine = 4.95 mg/dL [normal = 0.66-1.50]) over several days (1). Approximately one week later, he experienced signs consistent with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, a potentially fatal systemic inflammatory syndrome, including elevated ferritin, triglycerides, and interleukin-2 levels, and hemophagocytosis cells on bone marrow biopsy (2). Patient A was a maintenance worker with frequent rodent sightings at his workplace. Serology results were positive for hantavirus immunoglobulin (Ig) M and IgG. Additional tests sent to CDC returned with hantavirus IgG and IgM titers >1:6400, confirming recent infection with Seoul hantavirus (SEOV). Virus isolation was unsuccessful (1). Comprehensive testing for other infectious etiologies returned negative results. The patient responded to supportive treatment and was eventually discharged.

Patient B, a man aged 37 years with history of chronic kidney disease, 5 months later in November 2018, was evaluated in a DC emergency department with a 3-day history of chills, fever (104 deg F [40.1 deg C]), headache, myalgia, and productive cough, followed later by diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. On further evaluation, he had elevated hepatic transaminases (aspartate aminotransferase = 164 units/L [normal = 3-34], alanine aminotransferase = 78 units/L [normal = 15-41]), thrombocytopenia (43 000/μL), and acute kidney injury (BUN = 36 mg/dL and creatinine = 7.6 mg/dL) during his admission. The patient worked as a dishwasher and plumber's assistant, had no recent history of travel outside the United States, and did not own any pets. He was unaware of exposure to rodents at work, at home, or during his commute. Serology sent to rule out hemorrhagic fever-renal syndrome returned with IgG and IgM titers of >1:6400, confirming recent infection with SEOV. Comprehensive testing for other infectious etiologies returned negative results. The patient responded to supportive treatment and was eventually discharged.

SEOV is a type of hantavirus previously associated with hemorrhagic fever-renal syndrome. Patient A is believed to have had the 1st case of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis related to hantavirus infection reported in the United States and the 2nd worldwide (1,3). Past studies have documented that Norway rats [_Rattus norvegicus_] serve as the reservoir species for SEOV in the United States (1,4), and previous cases of hantavirus infection have been linked to wild or pet rodents (4,5). Humans can become infected with SEOV through aerosol exposure to virus shed in rodent feces, saliva, or urine. Rodent overpopulation in DC is well documented by increased complaints via the Citywide Call Center to the Rodent Control Program, and the DC Department of Health has amplified efforts to address this public health threat. Although extremely rare, the 2 SEOV cases presented in this report highlight the importance of physicians including hantavirus infection in their differential diagnoses in patients with compatible symptoms and history of animal exposure or travel and underscore the importance of reporting notifiable infectious disease cases to health departments for investigation and response. These cases also serve as a reminder to the public to minimize risk for infection by following recommended hygiene practices.

Cases of infection with Seoul hantavirus in the USA are diagnosed rarely, but likely under-diagnosed in the Americas. The occurrence of 2 unrelated SEOV infections in the Washington DC area, but in different localities, in May and November of 2018, is very unusual.

Dr. Jan Clement offered some useful information about SEOV occurrence and diagnosis (see Hantavirus - Americas (07): Panama comment 20210624.8473120). ". . . wild rat-induced SEOV [Seoul virus] infection should be included in each serological investigation of a suspected [hantavirus infection] case, even when admittedly RT-PCR remains the gold standard. However, due to the short duration of SEOV viremia, RT-PCR remains often negative, so that plaque reduction neutralization tests (PRNT) in specialized labs or serology in other labs are often the only solution. Commercial hantavirus tests, however, often lack a diagnostic SEOV antigen, so that cross-reacting other murid hantaviral pathogens often result in the diagnosis of an 'HTNV' [Hantaan virus] or a 'DOBV' [Dobrava virus] infection, even in regions where these pathogens are actually absent.

"In an immunofluorescence assay (IFA), murid prototype HTNV 76-118 strongly cross-reacts equally with murid SEOV, and also, mostly to a lesser degree, with arvicolid PUUV [Puumala virus]. Of note, these same IFA cross-reactions allowed, from the early 1980s onward, the start of surprisingly efficient serodiagnosis for Western-European HFRS [hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome], despite being predominantly PUUV-induced, indeed (Clement 2015, Clement et al. 2019). Moreover, in pioneer IFA times, the former prudent circumscription of worldwide omnipresent rat-borne SEOV pathogen was consequently always described as being 'HTNV-like,' like in a few African countries (Clement et al. 2019). However, these same serological cross-reactions bear an implicit warning for developed regions like Finno-Scandia, where sero-diagnoses, until now, often rely on assays containing only PUUV antigens considered (wrongly), since decades, as the sole local hantaviral pathogen. Of note, not a single SEOV-HFRS case was reported so far from Finno-Scandia, despite demonstration, dating from 1989, of SEOV-infection in local rats (LeDuc et al., 1986). The same observation is valid for blatantly absent diagnoses of human SEOV infections hitherto from vast regions like Australia and New Zealand despite, again, the demonstration of SEOV-infected rats already since 1986 (LeDuc et al., 1986)."

"In summary, SEOV is mentioned in virtually each hantavirus paper as the only global hantaviral pathogen but is, in fact, almost never considered in the description of new local HFRS (or HCPS [hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome] cases. Thus, paradoxically enough, it is the only global hantaviral pathogen [that] remains a permanent blind spot in hantavirology.
