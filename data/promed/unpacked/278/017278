Over 1000 people who attended a wedding dinner in the Savala village of Visnagar, Mehsana on [Fri 4 Mar 2022], were rushed to health facilities following food poisoning. According to police inspector BL Maheriya of Visnagar taluka police station, the wedding of former Congress leader Wazir Khan Pathan's son was held on [Thu 3 Mar 2022] and the next day on [Fri 4 March] a dinner was organized at Savala with "12 000-15 000 guests in attendance". Of those, around 1057 guests started exhibiting symptoms of food poisoning such as vomiting and diarrhea and were admitted at various health facilities in Gandhinagar.

SP Parthrajsinh Gohil said that after being informed of the incident by hospital authorities, police registered a 'janvajog' (station diary entry) and pursuant to the same, an inquiry by the police has been initiated. "FSL and FDCA have taken samples of sweets and other food items served at the dinner and the results are awaited. The Health department too is working on this and has taken samples of the vomit and stool. Prima facie it seems the caterer may have been negligent and there could have been adulteration in the food," Gohil said. Approximately 1250 guests have been affected with mild to moderate symptoms. There have been no deaths so far," he added.

Mehsana chief district health officer Vishnu Patel remained unavailable for comment despite repeated attempts.

[It can be quite helpful in suspecting an etiology to know the incubation period, what food is suspected, whether fever was present, besides the presence of vomiting and diarrhea. As can be seen by the See Also list below, not all of these clusters are due to infection. - Mod.LL
