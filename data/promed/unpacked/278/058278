MALARIA - PAKISTAN (03): (SINDH), COMMENT

The post on 7 Oct 2011 on the remarkable outbreak of malaria in
multiple provinces of Pakistan suggests that the recent disbanding of
the Ministry of Health has led to the consequences the international
community had predicted and feared. The Ministry of Health was
abolished at the national level, and the provinces are left to conduct
health matters on their own. The website of the former Ministry of
Health also announced the closure: http://www.health.gov.pk/.

Polio has spread over Pakistan's borders into China; national
coordination of anti-malaria efforts seems lacking, and Pakistan's
ability to mobilize a national response against infectious threats is
threatened. This issue is of grave concern to WHO and also to other
national governments, including the USA and Afghanistan. It makes it
difficult, if not impossible, to fund public health projects, removes
professional national-level oversight, and allows provincial
ministries of health to fall under local political and fundamentalist
sway.

Note: This is my professional opinion and does not necessarily
represent the official position of the Department of Defense or the US
government.

[ProMED thanks Warner Anderson for his comment. We agree that the
question of coordination of health efforts like the malaria and polio
control programs and supervision of provincial governments are
important issues. ProMED will be happy to post a comment from the
Pakistani authorities. - Mod.EP]
