ARGENTINIAN HEMORRHAGIC FEVER VACCINE
=====================================

AHF vaccine is a good example of what an orphan vaccine means to people.

Candid 1, a live attenuated Junin virus vaccine, was developed through an
international cooperative project involving the Government of Argentina,
the Pan American Health Organization, the United Nations Development
Programme, and the United States Army Medical Research and Development
Command.
After completion of preclinical testing, the safety and
immunogenicity of this vaccine was established between 1985 and 1988 in the
United States and Argentina. Between 1988 and 1990, a prospective,
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial established the efficacy
of Candid 1 in the prevention of AHF in human volunteers aged 14-65
years: 95.5 %.
Since 1991, vaccination of the population at highest risk for
the disease was initiated. Limited quantities of vaccine available
(produced at the Salk Institute) restricted the areas targeted. Up to 1997,
more than 160,000 persons have received this vaccine and current studies
continue to reinforce previous observations concerning safety and efficacy
of this vaccine for adults of both sexes, and show that Candid 1 is highly
immunogenic when administered under field conditions. Persistence of
neutralizing antibodies was shown in 91.5% of a sample up to 84 months
following immunization.
So we have here an excellent vaccine for a disease
with a case-fatality rate of 15-30% when untreated, but with a low
incidence in a restricted geographic area of one country. At risk population
is estimated at 3,500,000 inhabitants.
It was originally projected (1978)that a plant for vaccine
production would be constructed in Pergamino, personnel trained, and the
vaccine manufactured here. This plant is not finished yet due to financial
problems. Review of the economics of vaccine production as practiced today
suggests that the commitment of an entire vaccine facility to the
manufacture of AHF vaccine alone would not be economically sustainable in
the long term because of the limited demand. However, such a facility could
be developed and would be financially (viable) if it produced AHF vaccine as
well as other products With this idea in mind, the existence of a
well-equiped vaccine plant in Pergamino would assure the availability of
safe, well-manufactured AHF vaccine to inhabitants of the endemic area at a
reasonable cost, regardless of the perturbations of the market. For this
project to be really worthwhile for the country, there should have been at
least a ten year commitment without budget cuts to achieve full production,
a situation that did not occur.

Finally, due to the commitment of the people in the endemic area who
now understand the benefits of facing such a disease with a vaccine, it
seems that the financial problem is coming to an end. If this is the case,
Candid 1 vaccine would be available for all those persons at risk willing
to be immunized. In that case Maiztegui's disciples could think of him,
resting in peace.

institute is named - Mod.JW]
