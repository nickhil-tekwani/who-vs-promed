Rubella in Japan: comment on vaccination
----------------------------------------
According to the National Institute of Infectious Diseases in Japan, as of week 21 2013 [20-26 May 2013], 672 cases of clinically or laboratory-confirmed rubella were reported in Japan. We have 47 prefectures in Japan; the epidemiological situation varies from prefecture to prefecture. 204 cases of rubella were reported from Osaka prefecture that week, the most, followed by Tokyo metropolitan (112 cases), Hyogo prefecture (85 cases), Kanagawa prefecture (61 cases), Wakayama prefecture (33 cases), and Chiba prefecture (24 cases). [Data and figure available at http://www0.nih.go.jp/niid/idsc/idwr/diseases/rubella/rubella2013/rube13-21.pdf (partly in Japanese)].

The number of reported cases in these 6 prefectures amount to 77 percent of the total in Japan. All of these 6 prefectures have begun to subsidize vaccination fees for adult people who are at risk. The governments of many other prefectures or cities are also implementing subsidisation.

[ProMED-mail and this moderator thank Dr Ogata for providing this new information recording the extension of cost-free immunisation to include those members of the adult population who may be at risk as a consequence of previous vaccination policy. - Mod.CP
