From: Takashi Suzuki <takashi@enterprise.net>

According to our latest study, hepatitis C virus (HCV) is endemic in west
Africa, where the vast majority of the patients are infected with genotypes
1 and 2. In rural areas of 2 countries (Guinea + Burkina Faso), the
genotypes were exclusively 1 & 2. The prevalence of HCV positivity
reached 3.1% and is expected to increase.
Interestingly, the annual cumulative incidence of acute/subacute episodes
was much higher in HCV than HBV infected population. Though dual infection
with HBV was scarce, coinfection with HIV represented 7.5-10% of the HCV
positive population.
Hence, and in the absence of measures coming in aid for the African
developing countries in terms of therapeutics, the lethality of HCV in
Africa may take a somewhat dramatic proportions.
It is indeed time to ponder strategies to reinforce awareness as well as
"do something" as regards to therapeutics of people in African countries.
Any ideas?
