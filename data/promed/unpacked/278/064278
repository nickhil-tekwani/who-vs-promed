Chile: 2 cases of Hantavirus Infection Confirmed in Talagante Province
-----------------------------------------------
Mr. Gonzalo Urrutia, Provincial Governor for Talagante, announced that only
2 cases of hantavirus infection have been reported in the area for 2006 and
not 7 as reported by some media sources during this week [final week
January 2006].
Mr. Urrutia pointed out that "the 1st case, which regrettably was fatal,
affected a woman living in the El Oliveto de Lonquen area who contracted
the infection through risky conduct, such as working in the field without
protection, taking walks in places inhabited by rodents and eating wild
fruits from such places."
He added that: "The 2nd case is a man who has already recovered from a
critical illness contracted as a consequence of hantavirus infection. He
lives in Talagante, but he contracted hantavirus infection during the
course of agricultural work without adequate precautions in the Chinihue El
Cristo area, and he was treated in Melipilla community, but for statistical
purposes, he is considered as a case registered in this province.

[The long-tail rice rat (_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_) is likely to be the
main hantavirus vector in central and southern Chile, and _Andes virus_ is
likely to be the species of hantavirus responsible for outbreaks of
hantavirus-associated disease (hantavirus pulmonary syndrome) in this part
of the world. Nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence homologies between
hantavirus samples from southern Argentina and Chile ranged from 90.9 to
100 percent and 96.4 to 100 percent, respectively (see: Padula et al.
Virology, Volume 241, Number 2, February 1998, pp. 323-330). Phylogenetic
analysis revealed that all these viruses belong to the _Andes virus_
lineage. The molecular genetic data obtained by Padula et al. with _Andes
virus_ indicated for the 1st time that person-to-person transmission of a
hantavirus was a possibility. However, as in the 2 cases described in the
above report, and in general, hantavirus infection of humans occurs via
inhalation of contaminated rodent excreta. - Mod.CP]
