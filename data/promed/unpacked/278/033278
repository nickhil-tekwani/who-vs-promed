PRAGUE: On Wednesday, the Czech Republic said it suspected a 6-year-old cow
on its territory had developed mad cow disease (Bovine Spongiform
Encephalopathy, BSE), arousing fears BSE may have spread beyond western
Europe.
"At this point, we can confirm the first suspicion of BSE in the Czech
Republic," Czech Agriculture Ministry press official Hugo Roldan said.
Roldan said the animal was from a herd in Dusejov village in the Jihlava
region, 70 miles southeast of Prague.
"This is the first test, it is necessary to confirm the first result, so we
are sending the sample to a laboratory in Germany to confirm or refute our
results," he added.
BSE has spread in herds in Britain, France, and other west European
countries, but until now has not been suspected in the Czech Republic or
the east European region as a whole. In April the European Commission
listed the Czech Republic as a country likely to present a BSE risk,
because it had imported significant amounts of live cattle and
meat-and-bone meal from EU countries where BSE has been confirmed.
Scientists believe BSE is transmitted through infected meat-and-bone meal
fed to cattle and may cause the fatal, brain-wasting variant
Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD) in humans. More than 80 people in Britain
have died of vCJD.
The ministry said the cow came from a cooperative farm having 371 cows.
Some 18 pregnant cows were in the affected stall. Pavel Kovar, of the
ministry, said milk feed substitutes were being investigated as a possible
cause of the case and added that bone meal had not been fed to the herd.
"We are investigating if the contamination could have happened through
feeding of milk feed substitutes in which milk fat was [replaced by
rendering-plant fat," Kovar said, adding that the mixtures were imported.
"We know they (the affected farm) used the substitutes but must confirm it
was at this time. It is after all, 6 years ago," he said.
Roldan said officials would begin testing all cows older than 30 months if
the tests confirm the case. So far Czech officials have conducted over 10
000 tests this year.
The European Commission declined to comment on the Czech discovery until
the results of further tests were known.
On 3 Apr 2001 the European Commission listed the Czech Republic as a Category
III country, which means it was "likely to present a BSE...risk, even if
not confirmed, or presenting a low level of confirmed BSE risk." It based
its assessment on the amount of live cattle and meat-and-bone meal imported
into countries in question. Other countries listed in category III are
Poland, Hungary, Estonia, Lithuania, Slovakia, Cyprus, Switzerland, and
Albania. Switzerland is the only country outside the EU to have confirmed
the presence of native cases of BSE. All the countries except Switzerland
and Albania are candidates for EU membership.
Czech officials had urged the EU to revise the list, dropping their country
from it. The Czechs banned feeding all meat-and-bone meal to cattle in 1991
and Czech officials have said the country had not imported British bone
meal, and did not feed meal from other countries to cattle because it was
too expensive.
The European Commission's category II country list, where a BSE risk is
deemed to be unlikely but not excluded, contained the United States,
Canada, India, Pakistan and Colombia. Category I countries -- deemed highly
unlikely to contract the disease -- include Argentina, Australia, Brazil,
Norway, and New Zealand.

PRAGUE: On Friday, the second test on a 6-year-old Czech cow suspected of
having BSE) has proven positive, Agriculture Minister Jan Fencl said.
"(A new test) confirmed the original finding," Fencl said, adding a
further test to verify the results would be carried out in Germany. "I
expect the result...from a laboratory in Germany by the middle of the next
week," he said.
Before this latest case -- which would be the first outside western Europe
-- Czech officials had tested more than 10 000 animals this year and found
no signs of the disease.
