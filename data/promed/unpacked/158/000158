------------------------------------------------------------
The person traveled from Nepal to New Delhi, India, and "symptoms appeared one month after his arrival in New Delhi." The initial symptoms were related to skin and then jaundice developed.

The incubation period of hepatitis E varies from 2 weeks to 10 weeks. So he could have acquired the infection either in Nepal before travel to India, or after arrival in India. Patients with acute hepatitis E often have non-hepatic symptoms for a few days before the onset of jaundice (prodromal period or prodromal symptoms). Itching can be one such symptom. More details on what the skin manifestations were would be useful.

[ProMED-mail thanks the writer for the comments. It is not entirely clear in which country the transmitted viral hepatitis was acquired since it may occur in both countries. - Mod.LL
