Viet Nam to import foot-and-mouth disease vaccines from China
-----------------------------------------------
Viet Nam has planned to import some 2 million doses of vaccines
against foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] from China next month, a local
official told Xinhua on Wednesday [10 May 2006].
"We plan to buy about 2 million doses of vaccines against FMD virus
type O from China to serve the prevention work of some northern
provinces such as Lang Son, Ha Giang, Quang Ninh, Dien Bien and Lai
Chau," said Van Dang Ky, vice head of the Epidemiology Office of the
Department of Animal Health under the Ministry of Agriculture and
Rural Development. [Map at

Viet Nam is also expected to import 2 million doses of vaccines
against the disease's viruses of different types from the United
States and the Netherlands for the national reserve this month, he
said. [We are unaware of FMD vaccine producers in the USA. - Mod.AS]
Amid the disease's spread to 36 cities and provinces across Viet Nam,
hitting some 36 500 pigs, bulls and buffaloes, the ministry has asked
the government to establish a national steering committee on
combating and preventing FMD.
Viet Nam is intensifying control over cattle transport and trade in
affected areas, offering financial assistance, ranging from 0.2-1
million Vietnamese dong (USD 12.6-62.9), to [farmers] for each cattle
culled, and vaccinating healthy animals, mainly bulls, cows and pigs.

PM issues order to control foot-and-mouth outbreak
-----------------------------------------------
Prime Minister Phan Van Khai has issued an urgent order to prevent
the spread of FMD on animals and control outbreaks that have occurred
in many localities.
People's committees in cities and provinces are required to follow
the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development's guidelines to
stamp out outbreaks and prevent large scale spread of the disease,
the directive says.
Animal health units have been asked to supervise and control the
situation in each locality, vaccinate animals around high-risk and
outbreak areas, clean the environment in breeding facilities and
closely examine animal transport.
When an outbreak occurs, the affected localities will have to declare
their outbreaks according to the current regulations of the animal
health sector.
The Prime Minister has also asked animal health agencies, customs
offices, market watch teams, border guards and police to strictly
monitor transport and trade in animals and animal products.
Strict punishment will be given to illegal imports of animals and
animal products through borders and people who transport and trade in
animals which are infected with the disease.
In the northern Lao Cai Province, the outbreak of FMD has been
brought under control, one month after it appeared in the locality,
thanks to effective prevention work conducted by relevant sectors and
people.
According to reports, the disease had spread from lax management in
buying, selling and transporting buffaloes and cows that carried the
disease from other areas, particularly in some border communes that
bought affected buffaloes and cows from China.
Following the outbreak, provinces along the borders had taken
initiatives to control the disease in high-risk areas by strictly
monitoring animal herds in every village and tightening control at
border gates.
The provinces were granted over 66 100 doses of vaccine, and local
authorities sprayed chemicals to clean the environment at outbreak
areas and slaughtered all animals infected with the disease.

[FMD is known to be endemic in Viet Nam. According to the official
information duly provided by the Vietnamese authorities to the OIE
for the year 2004, cattle, buffaloes and pigs were affected by
serotypes O and A. No official information on the situation in 2005
is available on OIE's website, but the Annual OIE/FAO FMD Reference
Laboratory Network Report for the period January - November 2005 (see
<http://www.iah.bbsrc.ac.uk/virus/Picornaviridae/Aphthovirus/index.html>)
indicated that serotypes A and O were recorded in Viet Nam during the
covered period. In addition, according to a state-run newspaper,
testing on 19 samples from 268 pigs that died in June 2005 in Ca Mau
province (southern Viet Nam) showed that they could have been
infected with FMD (see 20050706.1908).
Since the beginning of 2005, FMD virus of serotype Asia 1 was
reported from vast areas in China, apparently spreading to China's
neighboring countries: Russia, Mongolia and Myanmar (see Laurence
Gleeson's commentary in 20050520.1385 and FAO's overview in
20050624.1774).
The large-scale spread of FMD in Viet Nam since the beginning of 2006
reflected in alarming news in the state-run media, as well as the
current information about the undertaken mass vaccination against FMD
serotype O "and different types" combined with the allegations on
illegal imports from China illuminate the need to rule out the
possible involvement of FMD serotype Asia 1.
According to article 1.1.2.3 of OIE's Terrestrial Animal Health Code,
member states are required to notify in case there is "evidence of
change in the epidemiology of a listed disease (including host range,
pathogenicity, strain)," as well as "a sudden and unexpected increase
in the distribution, incidence, morbidity or mortality of a listed
disease prevalent within a country or zone/compartment." One or both
of those conditions seem to apply in the current Vietnamese FMD
situation, justifying an official notification, which should include
data on the causative agent.
In the absence of official information, the diseases remains
"suspected" by default. - Mod.AS]
