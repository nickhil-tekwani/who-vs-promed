Ontario: First Human Case of West Nile Virus Infection; Imported
----------------------------------------------------------------
A man in eastern Ontario's Renfrew County has become the first person to
contract West Nile Virus in Canada this year, officials said yesterday [Thu
24 Jul 2003]. But the unidentified patient picked up the mosquito-borne
disease while travelling in the United States, not in this country, public
health authorities said. The man, who appears to have a mild form of the
ailment, is recovering at home and was never hospitalized, said Dr. Michael
Corriveau, Renfrew's medical officer of health. Few other details about the
case were released yesterday.
Dr. Corriveau refused to say where the individual had travelled in the
United States because doing so could help identify him. But he called
the region a "hotbed" of West Nile Virus. An Ontario government news
release said it is an area with known virus activity and "confirmed human
cases." The only place in the U.S. with more than one human case is Texas,
where 5 people have tested positive for West Nile, according to the U.S.
Centers for Disease Control. There has been one case each in Alabama,
Colorado, Iowa, Minnesota, Ohio, South Carolina, and South Dakota. Dr.
Corriveau played down the significance of the case, saying it posed no
public health risk since it was not locally acquired and West Nile is not
transmitted person-to-person.
Although Renfrew has had one bird test positive for West Nile this year, it
was not in the area where the man lived, and the timing of his U.S. visit
fit with the disease's incubation period. Still, officials are bracing for
the worst in the province after last summer's outbreak, when about 400
Canadians contracted West Nile virus infection and 18 died, most of them in
Ontario. By early this month, more than 2000 Ontario residents had been
tested for the virus on orders from their physicians; none tested positive.
