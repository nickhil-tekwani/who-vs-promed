Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) cases have been confirmed in
Canada in 2010. BSE is a reportable disease under the "Health of
Animals Regulations." This means that all suspected cases must be
reported to the CFIA. The following table lists individual animals
confirmed to be infected with BSE in Canada in 2010, updated 28 Feb
2010:

Date confirmed: 25 Feb 2010
Location: Alberta
Animal type infected: Beef cow
Age of animal: 72 months

The Badger has learned a new case of BSE was discovered 2 weeks ago,
but the public was not informed as part of the government's new
communication strategy. The decision not to announce new cases of BSE
was made in August 2009, and the public was informed by the Canadian
Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) online.

"The CFIA is committed to providing all stakeholders, including the
general public, media and trading partners, with timely information
about disease detections in farmed animals. As such, we have revised
how we report online for disease detections in farmed animals to
provide a more comprehensive view of Canada's animal health status.
All confirmed cases of federally reportable diseases in farmed
animals will be centrally located on our website. This information
will be updated monthly," explained CFIA spokesperson Jenn Gearey.

The new communication strategy means journalists will not be notified
when any new cases of BSE are discovered.

The latest finding of BSE -- Canada's 17th domestic case -- was
announced to industry stakeholders, such as processors, on 25 Feb
2010, but not to the media or general public. And while the CFIA
claims its reportable diseases page will be updated monthly, no new
information has been posted since 31 Jan 2010.

The infection was detected through the national surveillance program
in a 6-year-old black angus cow in the same general area of Alberta,
home to most of Canada's BSE activity.

The last case discovered in Canada was in May 2009, the only
occurrence that year. In 2008, there were 4 incidents; in 2007, there
were 3, and in 2006, there were 5 cases of BSE.

Canada's international risk status has not been affected by the latest case.

Canada has confirmed its 17th case of mad cow disease, a finding that
will delay any upgrade to its international risk status by one year,
a top industry official said on Wednesday [10 Mar 2010].

The animal was born in February 2004, making it Canada's latest-born
case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). The new case pushes
back the earliest date for an upgrade to Canada's controlled risk
status from the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) to 2016,
said Ted Haney, president of the Canada Beef Export Federation.

A country cannot apply to upgrade to negligible status sooner than 11
years after the latest-born case of BSE. The process then takes about
one year.

Canada, along with many other countries with controlled risk status
from the OIE, can ship beef as long as it meets conditions such as
disease surveillance.

The infected animal, which has been slaughtered, has not affected
trade, Haney said.

The 2003 discovery of the 1st case of mad cow disease on a Canadian
farm caused many countries to halt imports of Canadian beef. Most
markets have since reopened, but the cattle industry remains in a
slump due to other factors such as a strong Canadian dollar.

Mad cow disease is believed to be spread when cattle eat protein
rendered from the brains and spines of infected cattle or sheep.
Canada banned that practice in 1997.

The Canadian Food Inspection Agency tightened feed rules further in
2007 and said the moves should help eliminate the disease nationally
within a decade, although the agency cautioned it still expected to
discover the occasional new case.

CFIA spokeswoman Julie LePage confirmed the 17th case but could not
provide details of the new case.

The CFIA notified cattle industry officials of the new case late last
month [February 2010] but did not issue a news release, Haney said.

[While it may be CFIA's decision on how to notify the public, it may
not be in the best interest as far as public relations are concerned.
Also, the Reuters article does not make much sense. How can the OIE
status change be delayed to 2016 if it is 11 years from the last
case? From the CFIA website [article [1] in this posting], it appears
the animal was confirmed positive on 25 Feb 2010. Thus, 11 years
would be 2021. - Mod.TG]
