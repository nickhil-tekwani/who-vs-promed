BUFFALO, Wyo. - An equine strain of the herpes virus has been
found in a horse herd in Johnson County, according to the University
of Wyoming State Veterinary Laboratory. The disease has forced
authorities to euthanize 7 of 180 horses in the herd.
Veterinary officials initially focused their investigation on botulism, but
evidence now suggests an outbreak of equine herpesvirus type 1. The
virus can cause respiratory disease, abortions and neurological disease.
Signs of neurological problems include an abnormal gait, hind limb
weakness or paralysis, loss of bladder control and in some cases
complete paralysis and death.
UW (University of Wyoming) Veterinary Laboratory Director Frank
Galey advised horse owners in the area to be wary about mixing their
horses with others and to contact a local veterinarian if a horse displays
any of the signs. He said outbreaks of this type are unusual but do
occur from time to time.
The Johnson County outbreak is a little unusual because it involves so
many horses, Galey said. The infection itself can remain latent and
unobservable, which allows for its introduction into a particular herd.
The virus is often activated by some kind of stress. The horse will look
normal and all of a sudden it will get stressed and the sores come back,
Galey said. The virus can be transmitted through bodily secretions or
through the air, but the virus is cannot survive very long without a
host. The infection is likely to cause neurological disease in half of the
affected herd, but most horses will recover.
Affected herds should be quarantined for at least 3 weeks after the last
animal has recovered. Veterinarians recommend horse owners clean
and disinfect contaminated instruments, clothing, boots and equipment
before moving from one group of horses to another. Feed and water
that have been in contact with infected horses should not be shared
with other animals.
