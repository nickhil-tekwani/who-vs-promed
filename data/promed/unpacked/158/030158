7 cases of Pacific oyster mortality syndrome (POMS) in 4 regions have now been confirmed in Tasmania.

The 1st case of the deadly oyster virus was confirmed on [Tue 2 Feb 2016] at Pittwater in south-east Tasmania, the 1st time it has been detected in the state. The outbreak has already caused the death of 2.5 million oysters.

CEO of Oysters Tasmania, Neil Stump, said the latest test results have found another 6 detections: 2 positive tests in Pipe Clay Lagoon, 1 in the Upper Pittwater, 2 in Lower Pittwater, and 1 in Blackman Bay. "One could say it was inevitable when the disease was detected in Lower Pittwater, because of the flow of water through the water bodies," Mr Stump said. "There was a likelihood the infection would stretch to the Upper Pittwater."

Mr Stump said the oyster industry had been heartened by offers of support from Tasmania's Salmon Growers Association. "The salmon industry has already suggested that the funding that we provide as a state, and collectively amongst all the seafood industry in Tasmania to the FRDC [Fish Research and Development Corporation] for research ... be targeted to the key issues that are flowing out of this disease event," Mr Stump said. He also suggested other projects that were in the pipeline be put on hold. "We were extremely gratified that they (the salmon industry) have come forward and said that was something we should do," he said.

[Pacific oyster mortality syndrome (POMS) is a disease which affects Pacific oysters. It is currently found in 3 estuary systems in New South Wales (NSW) -- Georges River, Parramatta River, and the Hawkesbury River. A suspect case has also recently been detected in association with mortalities of farmed Pacific oysters in Tasmania

The 1st reported POMS mortality outbreak was in France in 2008. POMS affects Pacific oysters -- it cannot be transmitted to humans and there are no human health implications. POMS has not affected the Sydney rock oyster or the native (Angasi) flat oyster.

POMS was first detected in NSW in November 2010 when oyster farmers in the Georges River reported mortality of wild and farmed Pacific oysters. Immediate reporting of these mortalities resulted in rapid action by NSW DPI [NSW Department of Primary Industries] to investigate the cause and implement controls on movement of oysters and equipment from the area to help prevent further spread of the disease. In January 2011 the disease was also found in wild Pacific oysters in Parramatta River.

In 2011 national surveillance for POMS was conducted in NSW, South Australia and Tasmania. The results found POMS only in 2 NSW estuaries at that time (Georges River and Parramatta River).

In late January 2013, high mortality was observed among farmed triploid Pacific oysters from the Hawkesbury River and POMS was detected. In February 2013 the virus that causes POMS was detected in wild Pacific oysters from Brisbane Water.

What is POMS?
POMS is a disease that only affects Pacific oysters (_Crassostrea gigas_) [A photo of the oyster may be seen on the website referenced at the bottom of this comment - Mod.TG] and is caused by a virus called OsHV-1 micro variant. This virus has not affected other oyster species, such as the Sydney rock oyster.

How does POMS affect oysters?
Oyster mortality resulting from this disease can be very rapid (up to 100 percent mortality within days of initial detection). Mortalities are most prevalent between the months of November-April in the Georges River estuary, however little is known about the disease in other affected estuaries.

Studies in Europe found that POMS was detectable in oysters after mortalities ceased, which indicates that surviving oysters can act as carriers of the virus. At this stage, little is known about the lifecycle of this virus.

The highest mortalities occur in juvenile oysters (between 60-100 percent), however all life stages have been recorded as susceptible.

Outbreaks of POMS are believed to be temperature dependent, with the likelihood of POMS increasing as water temperatures rise. A number of studies in Europe suggest that outbreaks of this disease do not occur when the water temperature is below 16 deg C (60.8 deg F). The available data from NSW, although limited, suggests the temperature at which expression of disease is likely to occur in NSW is approximately 22 deg C (71.6 deg F).

In which localities does POMS occur?
Since the acute outbreak in France in 2008, OsHV-1 has been detected in Pacific oysters in the UK, Ireland, the Netherlands, Spain, Italy, Asia, and New Zealand.

POMS has been detected in NSW in the Georges River/Botany Bay, Parramatta River/Sydney Harbour, and Hawkesbury River (including Patonga Creek). DPI surveillance also found the virus that causes POMS in wild Pacific oysters in Brisbane Water in February 2013.

For more information on the Tasmanian outbreak, see the Tasmanian Department of Primary Industries, Parks, Water and Environment website [further down in this posting - Mod.TG]

What drives disease outbreaks?
It is not known how POMS arrived in NSW. Researchers are continuing to monitor Georges River to elaborate key factors affecting disease expression, such as oyster size and age, and water temperature.

'Oyster Health Sydney' is a project from the Aquatic Animal Health team in the Faculty of Veterinary Science at the University of Sydney which in July 2012 began a new research project in relation to POMS virus in NSW, for more information on this work, visit University of Sydney's POMS disease research.

From the Tasmanian Department of Primary Industries, Parks, Water and Environment (http://dpipwe.tas.gov.au/biosecurity/aquatic-pests-and-diseases/aquatic-biosecurity-threats/poms):

Is it safe to eat farmed oysters?
Oysters sold through retail outlets remain safe to eat. Advice from interstate authorities where the disease also exists say there is no risk to human health from POMS.

What is POMS?
POMS is a disease caused by a virus that only affects Pacific oysters (_Crassostrea gigas_). This virus has not affected other oyster species, such as the Sydney rock oyster (_Saccostrea glomerata_).

Where have oysters been affected?
Laboratory results from 1 Feb 2016 confirmed the presence of the disease at only one lease located in the Pitt Water area. Surveillance of other leases is currently being undertaken by industry and Biosecurity Tasmania.

When was the disease detected?
On Thu 28 Jan 2016, a lease holder in Pitt Water reported unusually high mortality rates within their oyster stocks. Samples from the oysters were taken and tested.

Laboratory results on 1 Feb 2016 confirmed the presence of Pacific oyster mortality syndrome (POMS). Samples were taken from neighbouring leases, results are not yet available. Oyster growers are being contacted to check for any evidence of increased mortality in other leases or growing areas.

Why have the Pacific oysters died?
The triggers for POMS are unknown but a range of environmental factors may trigger the development of the disease in oysters already infected with the virus.

Where did the virus come from?
Oyster viruses have previously been identified in Australian waters in bivalve molluscs, but until now have not been reported in Tasmania.

Are other animals affected?
No. POMS is specific to oysters and will not affect other marine animals.

What is Biosecurity Tasmania doing to limit the spread of the disease?
Movement controls and strict biosecurity conditions have been put in place to prevent movements of oysters and oyster farming equipment from the Pitt Water region. Strict biosecurity protocols are also in place for researchers and their equipment entering and leaving affected locations. A policy has also been developed that outlines management actions and legislative provisions that may be used in response to suspected or confirmed further outbreaks of POMS in Tasmanian waterways.

Oysters Tasmania has been very proactive in assisting with immediately suspending distribution of all stock in the affected area.

Biosecurity Tasmania is taking steps to contain the disease and determine its geographic spread. This includes:
- Working with industry to implement a standstill on movement of oysters (other than for human consumption);
- Notifying neighbouring oyster lease owners;
- Notifying other states;
- Notifying industry and discussing oyster movement restrictions;
- Tracing movements to and from the infected sites;
- Providing advice to producers as they check their leases for signs of mortality, and
- Testing oysters from other areas to determine the area infected.
- What can you do to prevent the spread of POMS to other oyster growing regions?

If boating or fishing in the Pitt Water region and you intend to move to another estuary:
- Ensure that fishing gear or other equipment are free of any oysters/sediment/biofouling;
- Drain all water from your boat and gear;
- Use car/truck wash to rinse gear and equipment, boats (inside and out) and trailers, and then air dry; and
- Flush outboard engines.
Reporting of mortalities in aquatic animals
Any unexplained and significant mortality of oysters (greater than 5 percent) should be reported to:
