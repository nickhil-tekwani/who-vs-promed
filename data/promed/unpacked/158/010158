A cat in Pueblo West tested positive for tularemia, a potentially
serious illness that can be passed on to humans. The Health
Department said the cat was an indoor/outdoor cat, and officials are
working with the cat's owners regarding medical concerns.

Tularemia is a potentially serious illness caused by a bacteria found
in animals, especially rodents, rabbits, and prairie dogs. Health
officials said the illness can be passed on to humans in a variety of
ways including: being bitten by an infected tick, deerfly, or other
insect; handling infected animal carcasses; eating or drinking
contaminated food or water; breathing in the bacteria.

Tularemia can be fatal if it is not treated with the right
antibiotics. Health officials said the best way to keep your pets
safe is to not let them roam or eat dead animals and to keep an eye
on their health.
