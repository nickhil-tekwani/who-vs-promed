every village in the country).
The DLD is now conducting the second round of active surveillance in the
area surrounding the 5 km zone (that is, within a 5 to 10 km radius) and in
those areas where avian influenza is suspected (for example, cases of low
production, cases of other diseases, or deaths due to other diseases).
About 10 500 samples are due to be collected during this round.
The results contained in this report are from the second round of
surveillance, which is still in progress. The results of laboratory tests
and details of confirmed cases will be reported to the OIE in due course.
