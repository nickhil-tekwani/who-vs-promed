Horse deaths from eastern equine encephalitis on the rise
---------------------------------------------------------
Another deadly horse virus; another case in Palm Beach County. It
sounds a lot like 18 months ago, when Wellington and much of
equestrian Florida was in the grip of an equine herpes outbreak that
eventually killed 6 horses statewide and pummeled the local equestrian season.

This time the illness is just as deadly, but the consequences likely
won't be as severe. [And preventable, as there is a vaccine. - Mod.TG]

The virus is eastern equine encephalitis (EEE), and state agriculture
officials warned this week that there are 4 times more cases already
this year [2008] than in the same period last year. Encephalitis
spreads through mosquito bites, and agriculture officials say that
after 2 years of drought mosquitoes are flourishing in the rainy weather.

So far this year there have been 45 cases statewide, including one in
Palm Beach County, up from 11 cases in the 1st 6 months of both 2007
and 2006. All the infected horses this year have died.

But encephalitis is unlikely to spark the kind of epidemic that the
herpes virus did. That's because unlike equine herpes, encephalitis
isn't spread from one horse to another and its vaccine is very effective.

"This is not something to panic about. It's something to vaccinate
for and you'll be fine," said Shana Chase, a Wellington veterinarian.
She said she makes sure her clients get their vaccinations twice a
year, rather than just once, because Florida has mosquitoes
year-round. [Also because immunity is short lived and needs to be
boosted. - Mod.TG]

"I'm concerned about it," Chase said. "I generally try hard to keep
the vaccinations up to date for everybody. This time of year it's
dangerous not to keep them up to date."

The virus affects a horse's central nervous system and symptoms
include fever, listlessness, stumbling, circling and coma.
Encephalitis is fatal in 90 percent of cases. Horse owners can
prevent infection by vaccinating their horses and driving out
mosquitoes by running fans and eliminating standing water. Wellington
also sprays regularly to kill mosquitoes.

So far there have been no cases reported in Wellington. Many of the
horses are gone for the summer and the village's equestrians have
gotten more serious about vaccinations since the herpes outbreak,
said Dr. Haynes Stevens, a Wellington veterinarian. "In retrospect as
tragic as it was, we handled it well and everybody has upgraded their
systems," he said.

The one Palm Beach County infection happened in Palm Beach Gardens on
11 Jun 2008, said Liz Compton, a spokeswoman for the Florida
Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services. It's the 1st case in
the county in recent memory, she said.

"It's very rare to have it in Palm Beach County. We're not sure why,"
Compton said. Broward County hasn't reported any cases and most
equestrians aren't too worried.

"It's not that prevalent down here," said Don Maines, a councilman in
Southwest Ranches and former president of the South Florida Trail
Riders Association in Broward. "If you're traveling to the center
part of the state like Ocala ... it's a breeding ground for the bugs
up there. Down here we have less mosquitoes because of all the building."

Chase, the Wellington vet, said she had a horse die on 19 May 2008
that may have had encephalitis but no necropsy was performed. She
said the horse had a spotty vaccination history.

In fact, most of the 45 horses that were infected statewide had not
been vaccinated recently, according to the agriculture department. A
few were vaccinated just days before they died but after they'd
probably caught the virus. "It doesn't erase the disease once you get
it," Compton said.

One difference from equine herpes: humans can contract equine
encephalitis and it can be deadly. The agriculture department is also
encouraging people to avoid mosquitoes by wearing long sleeves and bug
repellent, getting rid of standing water and repairing torn window
screens. It's also a good idea to stay inside at dawn and dusk when
mosquitoes are most active.

[This disease is totally preventable through a vaccine. It is very
cheap insurance compared to losing your companion and your investment.
The fact of unvaccinated horses succumbing to the disease should cause
people to take extreme caution with mosquitoes as the disease can be
fatal to humans. - Mod.TG]
