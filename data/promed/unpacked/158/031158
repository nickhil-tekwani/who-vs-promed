7 cases of cyclosporiasis have been reported recently in 3 states including Iowa and Nebraska.

Health officials are reminding you to wash your fruits and vegetables after an outbreak linked to an intestinal parasite. The illness causes severe intestinal distress that can last up to 2 months.

No cases have been reported in South Dakota so far, but because the source of the illness is linked to what the Iowa Department of Health calls "a fruit or vegetable with a wide distribution," officials want to get the word out as quickly as possible, especially with the holiday weekend. The illness is not contagious and is easily treated with an antibiotic.

14 more cases of cyclosporiasis were reported Friday [5 Jul 2013] in Nebraska and Iowa, adding to the 12 that had come in over the past several days.

Officials still are trying to determine the source of the _Cyclospora cayetanensis_ parasite, which causes an intestinal infection called cyclosporiasis. They're telling physicians to be aware of the illness and to test specifically for the parasite.

_Cyclospora cayetanensis_ is a parasite made of one cell, too small to be seen without a microscope. Cyclospora parasites are spread by people ingesting something, such as food or water, that is contaminated with feces. Cyclospora needs days to weeks after being passed in a bowel movement to become infectious for another person. Therefore, it is unlikely that cyclospora is passed directly from one person to another.

[Infection with _Cyclospora cayetansis_ is usually due to contaminated berries and may be waterborne. The multi-location outbreak reported here strongly suggests that it is due to contaminated fruits of some kind distributed to retailers over a large area.

The epidemiology has recently been reviewed (Chacin-Bonilla L: Epidemiology of _Cyclospora cayetanensis_: A review focusing in endemic areas. Acta Trop. 2010; 115(3): 181-93; available at http://ipac.kacst.edu.sa/eDoc/2010/190711_1.pdf. Ortega YR, Sanchez R: Update on _Cyclospora cayetanensis_, a food-borne and waterborne parasite.
