An announcement from the Instituto Adolfo Lutz in São Paulo confirmed the death of a howler monkey in the São José do Rio Preto (Sao Paulo state). The monkey was found on 25 Aug [2016], and the result of the test was announced this Wednesday, 14 Sep [2016]. The animal was found dead by a resident of the area, who advised Epidemiological Surveillance.

The Health Secretariat initiated a yellow fever vaccination campaign and active search for potential cases of the disease in the area of Estância Santa Inês, Vista Alegre I subdivision, Vista Alegre II, Jardim Navarrete, bairro Santa Inês, Santa Maria, São Marcos, Estância São Marcos and Estância São Pedro, in the southern region of the municipality. The vaccination measure was started this Tue 13 Sep 2016 after confirmation of the death of the monkey.

Yellow fever can be transmitted to humans by the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito that also transmits dengue, Zika and chikungunya viruses. But the type of transmission diagnosed in the monkey is sylvan [forest], which is transmitted by another mosquito.

Teams of the secretariat are visiting the lots with small farms, schools and markets in order to promote the vaccination situation with the residents related to the disease. Those who have not been vaccinated or whose vaccination has expired will receive a dose at the time of the visit.

In addition to this action, health agents are going to the locales this Thu 15 Sep 2016 and Fri 16 Sep 2016 for the blockage of transmission. Properties will be visited to eliminate potential mosquito breeding sites this Sat 17 Sep 2016 and will initiate fogging with insecticide in order to eliminate adult mosquitoes. The São José do Rio Preto has not registered cases or deaths from yellow fever in humans since the year 2000.

Yellow fever is a serious disease that can kill, thus vaccination is important for those not vaccinated or whose vaccination is out of date. Rio Preto has vaccine available at any of the 27 municipal health units. However, vaccination is not recommended for pregnant women, women who are breastfeeding infants less than 6 months of age, individuals under treatment that can compromise immunological response (HIV/AIDS, chemotherapy, etc.), or people with serious allergies to eggs or other components of the vaccine.

This year [2016], a 38-year-old worker died from yellow fever in the Rio Preto region. The victim lived in Bady Bassitt (Sao Paulo state) and died after being hospitalized for 2 weeks in the Hospital de Base in Rio Preto. Cases of this disease had not been registered for 8 years. This case of yellow fever was the sylvatic type of transmission and not the urban type, according to the secretariat.

[Surveillance of epizootics is one of the main pillars of yellow fever surveillance. When they occur, the epizootics must be considered a potential sentinel event (suggesting virus circulation) that can eventually proceed to the occurrence of human cases of the disease in given localities, including disturbed environments.

Because of this, actions are complex and involve investigation of primate deaths, identification of virus circulation (through serosurveys, for example), active searches for human cases (syndromic surveys could be a strategy), vector control, and vaccination.

Concerning yellow fever virus circulation in the São José de Rio Preto region, in 2001 (not in 2000), there was a human case, and in 2016, there was also a human case. Considering this chronology, apparently the yellow fever virus has been circulating in a cycle, up until now, for at least 15 years in the region. Because of this, there needs to be sensitive surveillance and the capability for timely responses. Routine vaccination against yellow fever has been recommended in the region. - Mod.RNA]

[If undetected or unaddressed, yellow fever can quickly get out of hand as it did in the beginning of the recent outbreak in Angola. The price of inaction is counted in lost lives. Although the death of a single monkey may seem inconsequential, as Mod.RNA notes, it is an important early warning sign that the virus is present in the area. Mounting a vaccination campaign and increased surveillance may appear to be an overreaction to the death of a single monkey, but it is not. It is a critical step in preventing the sylvan cycle of virus transmission becoming a dangerous urban cycle with human cases, as happened in Paraguay in 2008. - Mod.TY
