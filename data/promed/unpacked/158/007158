US Smallpox Vaccination Policy Decision Imminent
------------------------------------------------
WASHINGTON: US officials are putting the final touches to a strategy to
combat smallpox in case of a biological attack and promised on Thu 25 Jul
2002 to deliver a plan in a few days or 2 weeks at most. They are weighing
the risks of vaccinating large numbers of people with a vaccine that is
relatively dangerous, versus the theoretical but serious danger of a
biological attack. They also worry that legal action may result if people
develop complications as a result of smallpox vaccinations. "The threat of
smallpox is small, but it's not zero," said Dr. Donald Henderson, a chief
adviser to the federal government on bioterrorism. "If indeed smallpox were
to be released, it would be very serious...potentially a global catastrophe."
There is no question of vaccinating the general population. Rather, health
experts are trying to decide whether emergency department workers,
firefighters and others who may have to help in case of an attack or
outbreak should get immunizations. And if so, the question is how many of
them, and where, and whether family members should also be vaccinated. Then
the government is dealing with the question of what kind of action to take
should there be an outbreak. "We will have a policy in days, or 2 weeks at
the most," Henderson told a briefing for legislative and other staff
sponsored by the Alliance for Health Reform, a nonprofit group that runs
forums on health policy.
Smallpox was declared eradicated worldwide in 1980 and routine vaccination
stopped in the United States in 1972. Most, if not all, of the population is
considered vulnerable. The former Soviet Union is known to have experimented
with smallpox as a potential biological weapon, and the fear is that
extremists or even governments may be planning to use it. Smallpox covers
its victims with pustules and one third of patients die. It is a prime
candidate for use as a biological weapon. The Health and Human Services
Department and the White House are considering recommendations made by
experts who were studying the issue even before the September 11 attacks and
the anthrax-laced letters in October that killed 5 people in the US. But it
takes years to develop a new vaccine and the United States is stuck with 77
million doses of the old DryVax vaccine and 75 million doses of vaccine that
maker Aventis Pasteur had in its freezers and donated. By the end of the
year, 209 million more doses based on the old formula but made under cleaner
laboratory conditions should be available. But it may not be any safer.
"Smallpox vaccine is probably the least safe human vaccine," Dr. Anthony
Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,
told the briefing. Complications include a skin infection called eczema
vaccinatum. People with eczema who touch a recently vaccinated person can
develop this potentially fatal complication. HIV infections, cancer
treatments that can suppress the immune system, and people with transplanted
organs all are more susceptible to complications from smallpox vaccines.
That raises the question of lawsuits, and Henderson said his team is
thinking seriously about that. "To me, it looks like this is going to be a
great place for a trial lawyer to go to make a lot of money," Tennessee
Republican Senator Bill Frist, a doctor, told the briefing.
