The cholera epidemic, which has assumed the status of a devastating
hurricane sweeping through the northern part of the country, has now
recorded 6497 cases with 352 deaths and the Federal Government recently
alerted the nation that the entire country was at risk of the epidemic.

Ravaging the entire nation like wildfire, the ailment has surfaced in the
south western part of the country. In Osun State, no fewer than 70 persons
were hospitalized at the Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospital,
Ile-Ife on Fri 3 Sep 2010, following a cholera outbreak in Ife Central
Local Government of Osun.

Dr Funso Ajao, the state's director of Primary Health Care Development
Agency, announced this in Osogbo, the state capital on Sat 4 Sep 2010, in
an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN). Ajao said that the
affected persons were responding to treatment at the Obafemi Awolowo
University Teaching Hospital, Ile-Ife, where most of the patients were
admitted.

The reported case of the epidemic in Ile-Ife now included the state as one
of the affected states in Nigeria.

In a table showing the cumulative cases, deaths, and number of local
government areas affected by cholera outbreak from January to August 2010,
the 1st outbreak occurred in Adamawa State 2010 in June and [currently?] a
total of 352 deaths out of 6497 suspected cases of cholera had been
recorded in 11 states.

The table also showed that out of the 11 affected states, Bauchi recorded
the highest with 1725 cases of cholera, 53 deaths, and 8 local governments
affected. Other states which had the highest cases include Gombe with 1188
cases, 59 deaths, and 2 LGAs affected, followed by Borno with 1090 cases,
80 deaths; Adamawa, 986 cases, 56 deaths, and 4 LGAs; Cross River, 557, 24
deaths; and Yobe 458 cases, 46 deaths and 3 LGAs affected. Jigawa recorded
86 cases, 6 deaths, and 4 local governments; Taraba 277 cases, 16 deaths
and 1 LGA; FCT 137 cases, 2 deaths, 1 area council; Kaduna 12 cases, 2
deaths, and 1 LGA; and Rivers 81 cases, 3 deaths, and 3 LGAs.

The statement added that laboratory results of stool and water samples
collected from suspected cases indicated that _Vibrio cholerae_ was
isolated from Gombe, Adamawa, Bauchi, Borno, Jigawa, and Taraba States,
while coliform was isolated from water samples in Rivers State.

It was also said that the reason for the outbreaks of cholera in most
states particularly in the north eastern part of the country this year
[2010] was as a result of heavy rains in most parts of the country leading
to flooding in many communities.

UNICEF says more than 300 people have died in the West African nation of
Cameroon from the country's worst cholera outbreak in 20 years. UNICEF said
Monday [6 Sep 2010] that more than 4500 people have been sickened by the
highly contagious infection that causes diarrhea in victims, leading to
severe dehydration.

At least 331 people have died since the outbreak began in May 2010, and
officials fear it will spread further when children return to school this
week [week of 6 Sep 2010] after the summer break. UNICEF is launching an
informational campaign in schools to teach children about good hygiene to
prevent the disease from spreading.

Over 60 000 flood survivors in 5 districts of eastern Balochistan were
suffering from epidemics, particularly gastroenteritis and malaria.
Well-reputed sources in the Health Department told APP [Associated Press of
Pakistan] that the government had been apprised that over 60 000
flood-stricken people out of total 1.1 million in 5 districts of eastern
Balochistan, including Jhal Magsi, Jaffarabad, Nasirabad, Sibi, and Bolan,
had been suffering from epidemics after consumption of contaminated
floodwaters. They said that at 30 medical camps set up in flood-hit areas,
30 00 patients with diarrhea had been examined. They added that over 12 853
flood victim children suffering from diarrhea and gastroenteritis had been
vaccinated [it is unclear what the cohort was immunized against - Mod.LL]
in the 5 districts so far.
