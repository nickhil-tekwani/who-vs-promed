Recent postings regarding influenza B in Australia have been stimulated by
the annual influenza awareness program conducted here. The program
highlights the need for annual vaccination in the defined risk groups and
seeks to improve vaccination rates in these groups. News services
recently carried reports of the epidemic and associated excess mortality in
1996-97 USA winter due to the A/Wuhan virus; however, Australia and New
Zealand both experienced extensive, and in some areas quite severe,
outbreaks due to this virus in 1996.
Recent epidemiology both in Australasia and elsewhere suggests that it is
most likely that Australia will experience influenza B outbreaks this year:
- Late cases in our 1996 winter and sporadic cases continuing into summer in
Southern Australia.
- An outbreak on an oil-rig in Darwin in December followed by outbreaks in
the Northern Territory early this year.
- An outbreak in Fiji commencing in January.
- Increasing influenza B activity late in the Northern winter.
The messages in the Awareness Program were:
- Influenza poses a substantial health risk to older adults and people with
a number of predisposing conditions (as defined in the Australian
Immunisation Handbook - National Health and Medical Research Council 1997).
- Those in the high-risk groups should be vaccinated every year.
- It is unlikely that Australia will suffer outbreaks due to A/Wuhan this
year and more likely that this will be an influenza B season.
- While influenza B is usually considered to be less severe than the
influenza A(H3 subtype) this is no reason for complacency, as type B
epidemics cause considerable illness and mortality.
- It is several years since Australia suffered a major influenza B outbreak
and population immunity is likely to be low.
- The average influenza-associated excess mortality in Australia is one to
one and a half thousand.
During the seven years since the commencement of the awareness program
annual influenza vaccination in Australia has increased from an average of
40 doses per 1000 population during the 1980s to 122 doses per thousand in
1996. Surveys indicate good targeting into the defined risk groups,
particularly older adults.
All recent influenza B isolates from Australia and Fiji are antigenically
closely related to the A/Beijing/184/94 reference strain and B/Harbin/7/94
vaccine strain, and are well neutralised by antisera to these strains.
The 1996 Australian influenza vaccines contain 15 ugm of haemagglutinin from
each of:
1) A/Texas/36/91(H1N1)-like strain
2) A/Wuhan/359/95 (H3N2)-like strain and
3) B/Beijing/184/93-like strain
