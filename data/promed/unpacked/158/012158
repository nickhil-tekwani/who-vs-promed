Despite ramped-up measures by pre-schools to curb the spread of hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD), the number of cases has continued its unabated rise, sparking concern among parents in Singapore. There were 1394 cases last week [week of 16 Apr 2012], a 19 percent spike from the previous high reported the preceding week. The latest figures bring the total number of HFMD cases this year [2012] to 13 289 [as of 27 Apr 2012].

According to a Ministry of Health (MOH) spokesperson, the HFMD cases so far are not related to the EV71 virus [human enterovirus 71], which [has been associated with] potentially serious complications. "There has not been any HFMD case with severe complications among the cases notified this year," a Ministry of Health [MOH] spokesperson said in response to queries. Adding that the MOH will continue to monitor the situation closely, she said that the ministry's surveillance of hospitals and general practitioners "does not indicate that the current uptrend is EV71-related."

With the number of cases remaining above the epidemic threshold, the MOH is also working closely with the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports to "ensure that high levels of environmental hygiene are maintained in the institutions." The MOH spokesperson said: "Institutions have also been reminded to check the overall health of children daily upon arrival and to refer sick children for further assessment by medical practitioners. This, together with maintaining a high-standard of environmental hygiene, is an important measure in preventing the spread of HFMD to other children in the institutions."

Pre-schools contacted by TODAY said they have increased their temperature and health checks. EtonHouse Pre-School, for instance, has stepped up its checks from twice to 4 times a day since February 2012. Director Josephyne Ho said the school premises and equipment have been fumigated daily with sanitisers since last month [March 2012]. Similarly, Odyssey The Global Preschool has increased its number of health checks to 3 times a day since January 2012, while toys are sanitised daily.

The MOH spokesperson said the ministry "strongly urges parents with preschool age children not to bring their child to school, or any other crowded public places, if their child is exhibiting HFMD symptoms and to seek medical attention early if their child is unwell." She added: "Parents should also ensure that a high standard of personal and environmental hygiene is maintained at home. Children infected with HFMD should avoid contact with other children. Articles contaminated by oral or nasal fluids from infected children should be disinfected."

The MOH spokesperson reiterated that HFMD is "a common childhood disease which is endemic in Singapore, thus yearly seasonal outbreaks can be expected. The disease is generally mild and self-limiting," she said.
