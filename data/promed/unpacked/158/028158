Swimmer bitten by rabid beaver at eastern Pennsylvania park
-----------------------------------------------------------
Officials say a man swimming at an eastern Pennsylvania park was bitten by a beaver that later tested positive for rabies.

The National Park Service said Friday [3 Aug 2012] that the visitor, who was not named, was bitten Thursday [2 Aug 2012] at Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area. Superintendent John Donahue said the person was swimming in the Delaware River just south of the park's Eshback Access near Bushkill at the time. He said the animal was later tested for rabies and the test came back positive.

Donahue said he did not know whether other park animals had rabies, which is transmitted by the bites of infected animals. Anyone who sees sick or dead wildlife there is being warned not to approach or touch the animals but to call the park's emergency center.

[Once they have the rabies virus typed it will be clearer how this beaver got infected, presumably when it was ashore and feeding.

[A rabid fox attacked people in Pennsylvania before, and another fox could have done the same to the beaver -- see ProMED 2009 reference below.
