Further details on the outbreak of foodborne Chagas disease in Caracas
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The number of persons affected by the orally transmitted Chagas'
disease outbreak dramatically increased during the past few hours in
Andres Bello Municipal School in Chacao [metropolitan Caracas],
Venezuela. Laboratory tests confirmed 128 positive cases of
_Trypanosoma cruzi_ infection, reported Dr. Luis Montiel,
epidemiology director of the Venezuelan Ministry of Health.
As of Friday [21 Dec 2007], 98 cases had been confirmed. Of the 128
patients, 9 have been hospitalized and are being treated: 7 at
Caracas' University Hospital, one at the JM de los Rios Children's
Hospital, and one at a private clinic.
According to Montiel, a new lot of the drugs required to treat the
infection will arrive from Brazil tomorrow [24 Dec 2007] and thanks
to the efforts of the Pan American Health Organization, treatment is
guaranteed for all confirmed cases and others that might occur.
None of the large pharmaceutical companies manufacture benznidazol or
nifurtimox, the 2 drugs used for the treatment of Chagas disease;
they are only produced in El Salvador -- with a special license --
and Brazil.
Although the cases are limited to the Chacao municipal school, the
national sanitary alert is still in place as a precautionary measure.
There are 956 persons in the school (including children and adults)
who are potentially at risk of acquiring Chagas' disease. It is
suspected that a fruit juice was responsible for the fast and
widespread transmission of the parasite. This is, at least, the
hypothesis of representatives of the ministry and scientists at the
Tropical Medicine Institute of Venezuela's Central University who are
investigating the acute outbreak.
Although the oral route is not the most common form of transmission,
the specialists have ruled out the presence of the vector [_Triatoma_
spp.] in the children's homes.

[With no other cases reported outside the school, the source of
infection most probably is a food item prepared, such as fruit juice,
as suggested in the message.
Previous outbreaks in Brazil (Santa Catarina, see below) identified
crushed sugar cane as the source of infection, probably contaminated
by feces from the triatomid bugs. - Mod.EP
