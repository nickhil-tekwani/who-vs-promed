Mysterious disease claims 8 lives in Morena0
-----------------------
A mysterious disease has claimed the lives of 8 people in Madhya Pradesh's
Morena District. State health authorities are reportedly still grappling
to contain the disease that is claiming new victims almost every day.
The Bhuravali village in the district has been most affected. Villagers
claim that patients first suffer excruciating pain in the stomach and the
chest and then die. Villagers have started believing the disease is a curse
from the gods.
"At first it starts with pain in the stomach and chest and the patient just
dies of the pain. Till now, 8 people have died of this mysterious disease
in the last one-and-half-months," said Ramhet, a villager.
"Our health team is visiting this area daily. Our health workers are
staying here. The Morena CMO has also visited this area and even I have
visited the area many times," claimed Dr. H S Sagar, the Block Medical
Officer of Kailash.

[The clinical picture of the illness responsible for these as-yet
undiagnosed deaths is vague and implies many possible infectious
etiologies. Hence, this moderator would prefer to defer attempting a
differential diagnosis until more information is available. Knowing the
clinical presentation, the age distribution of cases, and having
information on both fatal and non-fatal cases from knowledgeable sources
would be very much appreciated.
On 8 Nov 2004, ProMED-mail published a posting announcing an integrated
disease surveillance project that was to be launched in 9 states in India
of which Madhya Pradesh was to be included. Perhaps the above newswire
report is heralding an increased awareness of the importance of reporting
unusual disease clusters in the area. - Mod.MPP]
