The government is issuing a 48-hour temporary nationwide "standstill" order this weekend [26-27 Nov 2016] banning the movement of poultry in an effort to prevent the spread of bird flu. The Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs came to the decision at a meeting [on Fri 25 Nov 2016] as the bird flu alert status was raised from "caution" to "alert". The 2-day standstill applies all day Saturday and Sunday [26 and 27 Nov 2016].

Some 89 000 poultry farms, slaughter houses, fodder plants, and related vehicles registered with the Korea Animal Health Integrated System (KAHIS) are subject to the order.

The move comes amid outbreaks of the highly pathogenic H5N6 strain of avian influenza(AI) at farms nationwide.

[In its follow-up OIE report no. 1, dated 24 Nov 2016, South Korea notified 12 new outbreaks of HPAI H5N6, spread throughout the country, in addition to the previous, 1st 2 outbreaks notified a day earlier; it is circulating now in at least 6 provinces (see, with an interactive map, at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=21656).

Similar to the 2 1st outbreaks, the 12 new outbreaks were addressed by the application of stamping out, as follows:

Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Birds / 137 600 / (not calculated) / 4020 / 133 580 / 0

Of the 12 affected farms, 11 were duck farms, one was a (chicken) layer farm.

Possibly circulating in China since 2013, H5N6 HPAI was firstly reported in a poultry outbreak in China in May 2014 and since then it has been identified in Viet Nam, Lao People's Democratic Republic, Myanmar, and Hong Kong SAR, China and, this month (November 2016) also in South Korea and in Japan.

Since its emergence, 16 laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection were reported with this serotype, including 10 deaths, all from China. H5N6 HPAI virus shares the H5 gene with the H5N1 HPAI clade 2.3.4.4 viruses.

The extensive spread of H5N6 infection in South Korea's poultry, particularly in ducks, assumed to be continuing since the report above, combined with the zoonotic potential of this virus strain and its known circulation in wild birds, are a serious, alarming epidemiological situation, which has led the authorities to apply the severe "standstill" measure during this weekend (26-27 Nov 2016). The personnel of South Korea's Veterinary Services are facing a busy weekend and days thereafter. We wish them and the relevant stakeholders success in their complex task. - Mod.AS
