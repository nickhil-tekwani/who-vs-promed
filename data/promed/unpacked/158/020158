Forty-eight cases of norovirus and gastrointestinal illness linked to spot prawns have been reported in Canada, according to the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC). As of 1 Jun [2022], there have been 19 cases reported in Manitoba, 12 cases in Alberta, 11 cases in British Columbia, and 6 cases in Ontario.

PHAC is collaborating with provincial public health partners, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA), and Health Canada to investigate the ongoing outbreak, a public health notice published Wednesday [1 Jun 2022] reads. On [Tue 31 May 2022], Tri-Star Seafood Supply Ltd., which is based in Richmond, BC, recalled some of its spot prawns due to "possible norovirus contamination." The recalled spot prawns have been sold in British Columbia and Ontario and may have been distributed in other provinces and territories, CFIA said.

PHAC advised Canadians to check to see if they have the recalled spot prawns at home. If so, the agency said not to eat, use, sell, or serve the recalled spot prawns, adding that they must throw the recalled prawns and wash their hands. To further reduce the risk, avoid eating raw or undercooked spot prawns, and consume the prawns right away after cooking and refrigerate leftovers, PHAC said.

In addition, PHAC said Canadians can avoid cross-contamination by keeping raw and cooked spot prawns separated by using separated containers and utensils, cleaning cutting boards and knives, and washing hands with soap before and after handling any food.

"Noroviruses can be transmitted by ill individuals. Cleaning and disinfecting practices are the key to preventing further illnesses in your home," PHAC said.

Individuals who are infected by norovirus may experience the following: diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, stomach cramps, low-grade fever, headache, and more. PHAC advises individuals to contact their health-care providers if they are experiencing the above symptoms.

"The outbreak investigation is ongoing, and additional actions to protect public health will be taken as needed," the public health notice reads, adding updates will be provided as the investigation evolves.

[Most seafood-associated norovirus infections are related to shellfish, but other sources are sometimes found.

"Spot prawns are the largest commercially harvested shrimp in British Columbia and Alaska. Females can be bigger than 9 inches (23 cm). They have a distinctive reddish brown colour and white spots on their tail and striped legs. They live in rocky seafloor habitat and are hermaphrodites: after 2 years, the males change gender, becoming females.

"Turning bright pink when cooked, spot prawns are prized for their distinctive sweet flavour and firm texture. They are considered nature's 'fast food': cooking only takes 1-2 minutes, or you can eat them raw, a popular dish in Japan." - Mod.LL
