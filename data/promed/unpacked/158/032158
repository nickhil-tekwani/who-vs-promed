Banana producers in the city [Davao] have expected their yield to go down
by as much as 14 per cent due to diseases and peso strengthening. Stephen
Antig, president of the Pilipino Banana Growers and Exporters Association,
said that black sigatoka has hit some banana farms in the city. Black
sigatoka, is a disease on the banana leaves that can cut the production in
half as it is caused by a fungus that can be spread from tree to tree by
wind. It was discovered in 1963 in Sigatoka Valley, Fiji.
Antig said production will start declining by the last quarter of this year
[2007] until next year [2008]. This is because although the last quarter of
the year is usually the peak of the production, this year, the increase
will not be as much as last year [2006], he added. Last year, banana
exporters in the city delivered 130 million boxes of bananas at 13.5
kilograms (about 30 lb) a box.
To pre-empt the decline in production some banana growers have expanded
their farms to augment their production, Antig added. Most banana growers
signed contracts with buyers at the start of the year [2007], stating their
production goal and the prices of the product. The problem is that those
who have to borrow money for their expansion have been hit by the
strengthening of the peso, while others have to generate funds internally,
he added. Antig said the expected decline in production has resulted in the
proliferation of fly-by-night buyers offering prices higher than those
stated in contracts with legitimate buyers. "That is why theft cases in
banana farms have been very high," he said.

[Black sigatoka (BS), also known as black leaf streak, is caused by the
fungus _Mycosphaerella fijiensis_, which affects only species of _Musa_.
Worldwide, BS is one of the most devastating leaf diseases of bananas. It
is present in the Americas, China, South East Asia, and parts of Africa.
Several outbreaks in Australia have been successfully eradicated. Spread
occurs through rainwash or splash of spores and air currents. Infection
occurs on the youngest leaves of the plant during and immediately after
unfurling. Older leaves are not readily infected.
BS causes destruction of banana leaf tissue, which affects the
photosynthetic capabilities of the plant and can reduce yields by 50 per
cent or more. Fruit produced on diseased plants can ripen prematurely
during commercial shipment and cause further losses. The disease is one of
the main factors responsible for the decline in banana export industries in
South Pacific nations. Disease management includes frequent applications of
fungicides and cultural practices, but the high costs of these measures
make them essentially unavailable to smallholder farmers.
Another type of sigatoka leaf spot, yellow sigatoka (YS), is caused by the
related species _M. musicola_. Symptoms of both diseases are often similar.
However, YS is less serious than BS because symptoms appear mainly on older
leaves and therefore less damage is caused to photosynthetic tissue. Also,
there are more cultivars of banana and plantain with degrees of resistance
to YS than to BS.
