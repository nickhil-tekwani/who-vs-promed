China: More cases of hand-foot-mouth disease in Beijing
-------------------------------------------------------
On Thu 12 Jul 2007 Beijing reported 1025 cases of hand, foot & mouth
disease (HFMD), a 9.51 percent increase over the same period to
Thursday last week, according to the Municipal Health Bureau. A total
of 4657 people have been infected in the city so far this year, 83
percent of them children under the age of 5.
The municipal health authorities said the number of infections would
continue to rise, and more work should be done to prevent the illness
spreading. It has ordered all medical institutions to closely monitor
the disease. The city had reported 1092 cases in the year to 19 Jun 2007.
HFMD, also known as coxsackievirus infection, is a common childhood
illness that mainly affects children under the age of 10. Symptoms
include fever, sores in the mouth and a rash with blisters. It often
begins with a sore throat. Moderately contagious, the disease, more
common in summer and autumn, can be transmitted through nose and
throat discharges. It can sometimes be fatal if complications occur.
In Linyi city, eastern Shandong Province, 2 boys and a girl, all
under the age of 2, have died from the disease this year [2007],
according to the provincial health department.
China first reported the HFMD in Shanghai in 1981. An outbreak of the
disease in northern Tianjin in 1983 caused more than 7000 infections.
Last year [2006], China reported a total of 13 637 cases of the
disease, including 6 fatalities, according to the Health Ministry.
Except for Tibet, all other provinces or regions on the Chinese
mainland had reports of infected cases of the disease.
