Taiwan: Military Called In to Battle Dengue Fever
-------------------------------------------------
The Taiwan government will call in the military to help deal with an
epidemic of dengue fever that is the island nation's worst since World War
II, public health officials said on Mon 18 Nov 2002. As of Monday, the
Center for Disease Control (CDC) [Taiwan] has reported 4464 confirmed cases
of dengue fever, a mosquito-borne viral disease. Among them, there were 121
cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever, a potentially fatal complication, and 13
deaths.
The outbreak this year has broken the 1988 record, when 4389 confirmed cases
were reported. In terms of dengue hemorrhagic fever, both the number of
confirmed cases and the number of deaths exceeded the sums of those in the
last 14 years, the CDC [Taiwan]reports. About 98 percent of confirmed cases
this year were reported from 3 jurisdictions in southern Taiwan, according
to the CDC [Taiwan]. In Kaohsiung City, Taiwan's second largest city, 2305
cases have been reported. In the city's adjacent jurisdictions, Kaohsiung
County and Pingtung County, 1818 cases and 233 cases had been reported,
respectively, as of Mon 18 Nov 2002.
To further monitor the spread of the disease, CDC [Taiwan] officials
convened an emergency meeting in southern Taiwan on Monday, raising the
alarm levels in Pingtung County, whose population is about 900 000. In the
last 5 weeks, according to the CDC [Taiwan], the number of confirmed cases
of dengue fever in this agricultural county has doubled. Even the number of
suspected cases has been increasing sharply in the last few weeks. "At the
meeting, we have integrated assistance from soldiers, private pest control
companies, and local authorities. Effective prevention and control measures
will be carried out as soon as possible," Ying-lung Chiang, spokesman for
the CDC [Taiwan]under the Cabinet's Department of Health, told Reuters
Health on Mon 18 Nov 2002.
The hardest-hit parts of the county are Tungkang, a fishing port that is
home to 50 000 residents, and densely populated Pingtung City, with a
population of about 215 000. Chiang said that both manpower and equipment
would be available to the county from not only the military but also other
local authorities, such as the Taipei City Government. Beginning Tuesday, in
Tungkang, volunteers and local officials will apply pesticides and promote
public participation in controlling the insect responsible for spreading the
disease, the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito. On Thursday, Chiang said, soldiers
will carry out similar tasks in Pingtung City. "At least 150 soldiers will
be available to help the local government out," Chiang told Reuters Health.
In addition, disinfecting empty buildings and unoccupied apartments in
Pingtung County to wipe out breeding sites of the mosquito would be one of
main tasks, Chiang said.
Meanwhile, the situation in Kaohsiung County and Kaohsiung City has been
brought somewhat under control by public participation and local government
efforts, Chiang said. Residents in the 3 jurisdictions in southern Taiwan,
however, are strongly encouraged to cooperate with government officials to
continue clearing stagnant water in their homes and surrounding areas.
Chiang attributed the record-breaking outbreak this year to changes in
weather patterns, including higher temperatures and abundant rainfall.
CDC [Taiwan] officials estimated that the number of confirmed cases
resulting from the outbreak this year will exceed 5000 and the rise would
not stop until early next year. Dengue fever broke out in Taiwan island-wide
in 1915, 1931, and 1942 when Japan occupied the nation. After World War II,
the infection did not reappear until the early 1980s.

Panama: Third Case of Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever Reported in 2002
--------------------------------------------------
Panamanian Health Minister Fernando Gracia confirmed on Thu 21 Nov 2002 the
third case of dengue hemorrhagic fever in the country this year. Gracia said
the patient was a 31-year-old woman from Arraijan district. Her current
situation was reported stable with a satisfactory clinical assessment.
The 2 other cases reported in 2002 were in February and October [2002], in
Tocumen municipality and the San Miguelito district, respectively. During
the same period of last year, authorities reported 7 hemorrhagic dengue
cases.
The newly detected mosquito species, _Aedes albopictus_, is capable of
becoming a vector for both yellow fever and dengue hemorrhagic fever. This
insect is believed to be capable of carrying [all] 4 types of dengue [fever
virus], & [more] resistant to insecticides, making it more dangerous than
_Aedes aegypti_, the [usual] vector [of dengue fever virus].
