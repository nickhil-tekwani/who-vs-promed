Battlefords-area elk farm quarantined over CWD
----------------------------------------------
A herd of more than 100 elk on a Battleford-area breeding and hunting
farm is under quarantine after chronic wasting disease (CWD) was
discovered, officials say.

Scientists are now investigating Saskatchewan's latest outbreak of
CWD. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency confirmed an elk that died
on the ranch in March 2009 tested positive for the fatal disease.
Efforts are underway to assess whether other animals in the herd are
infected as well, CFIA veterinarian Cornelius Kiley said. "We will be
looking at a group of animals that were exposed to the original. It
could be the entire herd, or it could be a lesser number. We are
working our way through that process right now," Kiley said.

CFIA can't say when scientists will know the extent of the outbreak,
Kiley said.

This is the 2nd case of the disease on a Saskatchewan farm this year.
There were 4 cases reported last year.
