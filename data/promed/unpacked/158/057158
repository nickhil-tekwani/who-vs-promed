First case of BSE in Finland
----------------------------
The Finnish Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry has announced that Finland
has its first confirmed case of BSE in a cow. The case was confirmed in the
EU reference laboratory on Friday 7 Dec 2001. The cow had shown clinical
signs of disorder and was emergency slaughtered. The initial Western Blot
examinations in the national reference laboratory had already shown strong
evidence of a positive case.

The 6-year-old cow was born in Finland. No MBM has been used on the farm
for over 20 years. There is not yet evidence of the source of the
infection. All bovine animals on the farm of origin, all cohort animals,
and the progeny of the positive animal have been destroyed.

[The identification of a clinical case of BSE in Finland underlines the
great importance of clinical veterinary surveillance. Finland has carried
out a relatively low number of BSE tests in slaughtered cattle; figures can
be obtained at: <http://www.bsereview.org.uk/data/cattle-tested-oct01.htm>.

Finland was identified, within the EU assessment of the geographical
BSE-risk (GBR) of European and other countries, to belong to "Category II",
where "BSE is unlikely but it cannot be excluded that cattle is infected
(clinical or sub-clinical) with the BSE agent". The report on Finland's GBR
was published in July 2000:
<http://europa.eu.int/comm/food/fs/sc/ssc/out118_en.pdf>.

Out of the other European countries in Category II group, several have
indeed been found infected since the publication of their relevant reports.
During 2001, BSE has been identified for the first time in local cattle in
Italy, the Czech Republic, the Slovak Republic, Slovenia and Greece,
bringing the number of infected European countries to 17. So far, Japan is
the only non-European country where BSE has been identified in non-imported
cattle. - Mod.AS
