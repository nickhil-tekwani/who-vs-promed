The Uganda Wildlife Authority has registered over 150 deaths of wild animals due to anthrax at Queen Elizabeth National Park this year [2020]. Sam Mwandha, the executive director of Uganda Wildlife Authority (UWA), said the majority of the animals that died from anthrax include hippos, buffalos, bush pigs, among other species of wildlife.

To ensure that anthrax does not get out of control and end up in humans, Mwandha said: "Early this year [2020], when we saw the strange death of wild species in the park, we informed the Ministry of Agriculture in order to carry out tests and also inform the neighbouring communities to desist from eating any dead animal they find." Since it is difficult to see the signs of anthrax, Mwandha revealed that by the time they saw the animals, they were already on the verge of death since blood was oozing out of the eyes, nostrils, and other parts of the body.

Mwandha made the remarks during the World One Health Day celebrations held at the Imperial Royale Hotel, Kampala last week.

Musa Sekamatte, health ministry epidemiologist as well as National One Health Platform coordinator, said One Health works within governments to build resilience and sustainable systems to prevent and respond to zoonotic diseases and also address antimicrobial resistance and biosecurity.

To ensure that the spores in the water and the environment don't end up in other livestock, Mwandha noted: "We pick the carcass on a daily basis, dig a deep pit, bury the dead animal under and then put lime on top to kill the spores of anthrax." According to Mwandha, this year [2020], they had fewer deaths compared with previous episodes. In 2004, UWA lost over 2000 animals.

Anthrax is a bacterial disease that can cross from livestock when humans eat half-cooked meat. Humans can become infected through direct or indirect contact with sick animals. "We need to work with the Ministry of Health to ensure relevant agro-awareness to the communities. If there is an infection among the communities, people are quickly isolated so that they don't transmit the disease to others," requested Mwandha.

Dr. John Opolot, assistant commissioner, Veterinary Health and Zoonosis Department of Integrated Epidemiology surveillance in the health ministry, said this year's [2020] annual health day draws the attention of the global community to the need for the One Health approach to address threats at the human, livestock, wildlife, and environment interface. According to Opolot, Uganda has been undertaken as a hotspot country because many outbreaks that have occurred need a multisectoral and multidisciplinary approach to handle.

As almost 60% of the diseases that affect humans are from animals, Opolot said that according to the national action plan for health security after the joint external evaluation was done, there was a requirement suggesting to prioritise and handle rampant zoonotic diseases. Among the zoonotic diseases to be prioritised include anthrax, rabies, plague, and brucellosis, haemorrhagic fevers like Ebola, Marburg, and bird flu.

"When human beings get infected from zoonotic diseases, many people will die if not attended to early. In fact, it is vital to control such diseases early because some people who recover at least end up with some abnormalities, impairment, and lameness," explained Opolot. During outbreaks, Opolot requested the government to provide resources for treatment, quarantine, and survival to collect, analyse, and interpret, as well as disseminate the data as useful information for future planning.

To address the complex challenge emergencies, Sekamatte also asked the government to support the establishment of the National One Health structure so that it is able to fund the structure as established in 2016.

[In the ProMED report for 24 Aug 2020 (Anthrax - Uganda (02): (RZ) livestock, wildlife, human 20200824.7711274), there was a brief comment that wildlife deaths had been noted in the area, which surrounds the villages where human cases had occurred. Anthrax is a disease where coordination between the veterinary and public health services is necessary from day 1. All too often human cases are reported first because these get attention, despite multiple livestock and wildlife deaths in the background. It is impossible to control human cases when one ignores animal cases. Animal cases, usually deaths, if handled quickly and efficiently, result in few, if any, human cases.

In enzootic areas, livestock must be routinely vaccinated. Villagers and livestock owners must be aware that it is foolish to skin and butcher unexpected livestock deaths. Veterinary service folk and/or clinicians should be informed so that proper diagnostic samples are taken and submitted to the laboratory. Carcasses must be properly disposed of, preferably burnt. Even if annual vaccination is the rule, all too often the disease finds those herds and flocks that had not been vaccinated. And if an emergency vaccination program is initiated, remember to vaccinate all the neighbouring herds -- hungry female tabanid flies looking for their next snack ignore fences.
