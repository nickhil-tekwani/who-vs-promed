Mumps has broken out among staff at Gillingham's new Tesco Extra
store. Ten people have been off work from the Courteney Road store
suffering from an illness with mumps-like symptoms in the last month.

A spokesman said: "It is under control, and everyone is receiving
medication. More than 500 people work at the store, so it is a very
small percentage. "Where staff have felt ill at the store, they have
been sent home immediately. If anyone has phoned in with the symptoms,
they have been told to stay at home for 7 days." The store reopened at
the end of February 2011 after an extensive refurbishment and
expansion.

A member of the public contacted the Medway Messenger to express her
concern about mumps there because she has family members who use the
store with young children, some of whom had not had their MMR
vaccinations.

The outbreak matches a recent sharp rise in the number of cases of
measles and mumps nationally and across Kent. The general situation
has prompted the Health Protection Agency (HPA) in the southeast to
reiterate a warning to parents, urging them to ensure children are
fully protected with 2 doses of MMR [measles, mumps and rubella]
vaccine.

Spokesperson Teresa Cash said: "We have not been made aware of a
particular problem/outbreak in Gillingham. There has been an increase
in reports of mumps-like symptoms in the Kent HPU area over the last
few days. These are as yet unconfirmed by laboratory testing. These
reports are of individual cases, some of whom may well have
connections to particular places, but this is a detail about which we
would not necessarily always be informed."

So far in 2011 in the Kent Health Protection Unit (HPU), there have
been 115 reports of mumps-like symptoms, but only 24 confirmed cases.
There were 52 confirmed cases in the same period in 2010. In the whole
of 2010, the Kent HPU had 116 confirmed cases of mumps. Data had been
recorded differently in previous years, so it was not possible to give
a proper comparison. Ms Cash added: "It should be noted that it is
likely that many cases go undiagnosed or unreported."

>From January to the end of March 2011, there had been 19 confirmed
cases of measles in Kent, one of the highest levels in the southeast
region, with a total of 42 for the period. In the whole of 2010 in
Kent, there were 7 confirmed cases of measles with 107 confirmed cases
in 2009.

[The high level of measles cases in the county indicates that the
uptake of MMR vaccine has been less than optimal, and, consequently, a
proportion of children and young adults will be vulnerable to mumps
virus infection. It would be interesting to know the ages and
histories of the supermarket staff affected by this mumps outbreak.

Mumps is spread by droplets of saliva or mucus from the mouth, nose,
or throat of an infected person, usually when the person coughs,
sneezes or talks. Items used by an infected person can also be
contaminated with the virus. In addition, the virus may spread when
someone with mumps touches items or surfaces without washing their
hands and someone else then touches the same surface and rubs their
mouth or nose (such as at a supermarket check-out).

Most mumps transmission likely occurs before the salivary glands
begin to swell and within the 5 days after the swelling begins.
Therefore, mumps patients should be isolated for 5 days after their
glands begin to swell.

Most people with mumps recover fully. However, mumps can occasionally
cause complications, and some of them can be serious. Complications
may occur even if a person does not have swollen salivary glands
(parotitis) and are more common in people who have reached puberty.
Complications of mumps can include: Inflammation of the testicles
(orchitis), inflammation of the brain (encephalitis) and inflammation
of the ovaries (oophoritis) and/or breasts (mastitis) in females who
have reached puberty. Temporary or permanent deafness is a rare
outcome.
