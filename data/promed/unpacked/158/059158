2 dead birds found in Holbrook have tested positive for the West Nile Virus.
Board of Health Member Donna Dewar told the board of selectmen on 08
May [2007]that the rainy spring has brought out an early onslaught of
mosquitoes and the danger of spreading Eastern Equine Encephalitis
(EEE) and West Nile viruses from their bites to humans and animals.
"This year, probably because we had a lot of rain, the ticks and
mosquitoes are prevalent already," she said.
Dewar pointed out that [routine] testing of dead birds for West Nile
virus doesn't begin until 15 May and is carried out through the last
day of September. As a precaution, she said, the birds recently found
were tested. The carcasses are sent to a state lab and tested for
West Nile [virus] only, not EEE.
Communicated by:
ProMED-mail Rapporteur Joseph Dudley
[West Nile virus activity now has been detected in a northern
state. One wonders if virus transmission is going on in other
temperate zone areas in the USA, before routine testing of
mosquitoes, dead birds and sentinel animals is scheduled to resume.

[It would be a plus if states would report the species of positive
birds, presumably residents, not summer migrants and not predatory
species, which might indicate different routes of acquisition and
transport of the virus. - Mod.JW]
