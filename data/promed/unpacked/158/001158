[Viet Nam's last (4th) HPAI follow-up report to the OIE was sent on 27 Jun
2005, relating to one outbreak in Ben Tre province that started 10 Jun
2005. Reportedly, the causative agent was identified by PCR as highly
pathogenic avian influenza virus type H5. See
<http://www.oie.int/eng/info/hebdo/aIS_64.htm#Sec1>.
A new follow-up report might be expected.
Viet Nam was planning to start mass vaccinations against HPAI in
August. Reportedly, vaccinations will begin 1 Aug 2005 at commercial
poultry operations and smaller household farms in northern Nam Dinh
province and southern Tien Giang province in the Mekong Delta. - Mod.AS]
