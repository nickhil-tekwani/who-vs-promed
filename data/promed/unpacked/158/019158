Two cases of _Escherichia coli_ infection have been confirmed in Broome County [New York State], and 3 more are now under investigation by the health department, which is trying to determine whether the new cases are linked to those previously connected to Nathaniel Cole Park. "We have seen 3 additional cases in Broome County. Some have nothing to do with Cole Park, and some have something to do with Cole Park," said public health director Claudia Edwards.

The health department is still waiting to hear whether those cases are linked to Cole Park and whether they are the same strain, which has been found to be _E. coli_ O26, Edwards said. That's the strain that's been hitting the Southern Tier (of upper New York counties) and 8 other states, including Pennsylvania, Georgia, California, West Virginia, Missouri, and Michigan.

"It could be contaminated hamburger meat; it could be contaminated lettuce; it could be poor hand washing. Once a person is infected, there's a high chance of infecting other family members," Edwards said. "It could also be as simple as a child in a diaper entering the water and contaminating it."

Within the next few weeks, the health department will know more about the other 3 unconfirmed cases and whether they are officially related to Cole Park, Edwards said.

[The enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ (EHEC) serotype is now identified as O26, one of the non-O157 EHEC serotypes. ProMED-mail awaits further information regarding alternative sources of the pathogen.

As a reminder, other non-O157 _E. coli_ serogroups that have been associated with EHEC disease include motile ones such as O26:H11 and O104:H21 and non-motile ones such as O111:NM (or H-). Such non-O157 isolates can be obtained from sheep and cattle, and although they cause as many as 30 per cent of outbreaks of VTEC (1), they appear to be somewhat less (or at least more variably) virulent in a variety of in vivo and in vitro assays (2-4). In analyzing the genetic and phenotypic profiles of non-O157 groups, it has been found that they belong to their own lineages and have unique profiles of virulence traits different from O157 (5). The serogroups appearing to be most prominent are O26, O111, O128, and O103 (6), the former serotype being the implicated strain in this outbreak.

If a laboratory is using sorbitol-MacConkey (sMAC) plates to identify EHEC by virtue of O157's inability to ferment sorbitol, the non-O157 strains will be missed. In a 3-year pediatric study from the University of Washington, USA (7), 1851 stool samples were processed for sorbitol fermentation as well as toxin production by EIA (enzyme immunoassay), and 28 strains of O157 were found along with O103 (4 strains), O118 (2 strains), O111 (2 strains), and 3 other strains.
