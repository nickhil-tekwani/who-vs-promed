Ministry looks for clues to lethal virus in Jerusalem water supply
By Haim Shadmi, Ha'aretz Correspondent
The Health Ministry is examining the possibility that the intestinal virus
that caused the death of a 5-month old baby in Jerusalem last week may be in
the drinking water used in northern Jerusalem. Yesterday, a Health Ministry
mobile laboratory unit for the study of contaminants from Tel Hashomer Sheba
hospital took water samples for examination.
Last weekend another baby died, this time in the settlement of Nokdim, south
of
Jerusalem. The Health Ministry is investigating whether this case is in any
way related to the previous one. The baby in Nokdim died of respiratory
distress. He was admitted to Bikur Holim hospital in Jerusalem, and then
discharged, following which he died at home.
The death of a yet another infant, an 8-month old who died two and a half
weeks ago and who attended the same day-care center in Neveh Yaakov as one
of the other babies that died, is also being examined. In all, 5 babies have
died in the Jerusalem area in the last month.
Professional Health Ministry sources said yesterday that it was possible
that the
source of the virus is in the Jerusalem water supply, and that as of now
this is the
only possibility being considered. At a ministry meeting, it was also
reported that the number of infants currently suffering from vomiting,
diarrhea and fever -- the same symptoms that struck the babies that died --
is 5-6 times higher than normal. Five other children have been admitted to
hospitals in Jerusalem suffering from vomiting, diarrhea and rapid
heartbeats. Two other infants admitted to Hadassah Hospital on Friday were
diagnosed as having an infection of the heart muscle, the same complication
that caused the death of the infant who died from the virus.
The Health Ministry sources admitted that the ministry is having difficulty
identifying the virus. From lab tests conducted by the Health Ministry
following the infant's death, it has been discovered that it is an
intestinal virus, but the exact type is not yet known. The possibility that
the 2 infants from the Neveh Yaakov daycare center were infected at their
HMO healthy baby clinic has been ruled out at this point. The lab tests
conducted at Tel Hashomer showed that other infants in the daycare center
also carry the virus.
Epidemiologists point out that this winter is particularly bad in terms of
the incidence and severity of illnesses in general. They added that it is
not yet known if the infant deaths in Jerusalem have a common cause or
whether they were caused by unrelated factors.

Israel.  Mod.JW]
