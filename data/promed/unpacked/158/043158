[A rancher] has been around horses his entire life, but this is something he's only heard about.

In July [2015] the longtime Prince Albert area [Saskatchewan province] rancher discovered one of his horses had tested positive for equine infectious anemia (EIA), also known as swamp fever.

The hard-to-detect disease soon spread to the rest of his herd, and by mid-August [2015] he was forced into a difficult decision. On Wednesday [19 Aug 2015] he began putting down his horses.

"It's hard to replace those horses," [the rancher] said. "It was devastating to do what we did today, to put them down."

A total of 9 horses were put down on Wednesday [19 Aug 2015], and Winterholt said that number is expected to climb.

"Some of these horses, I've got a lot of money invested in them, and some of them maybe aren't worth much to people," he said. "But to ourselves, they're worth a lot of money because they're trustworthy. They've done us very well. How do you put a price tag on that?"

EIA is similar to HIV in humans because it attacks the immune system. Veterinarians need blood samples to detect it, since the symptoms resemble those of other diseases, if they show up at all.

"(The horse) can act normal, be normal, do normal everyday things," [the rancher] said. "You can ride them and everything like that, but until you draw blood from them you'll never know (they're infected)."

According to the Ministry of Agriculture, Saskatchewan EIA cases peaked during the 1970s. In 1975, 2172 horses across the province tested positive for the disease, but by the early '90s it was practically dormant.

From 2005 to 2010 only 4 cases were discovered in the entire province. Then, in 2011, EIA numbers shot back up, with more than 60 horses testing positive by October.

The disease typically spreads through flies, mosquitos or other insects that bite an infected horse before transferring it to another.

It's most often found in the northern parts of Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia, and [the affected rancher] said the only way to stop it was through vigilant testing programs.

"I think (the government) should start implementing it, and make it a mandatory test right across the board. I think that's the only way you're ever going to get a little bit of control on this disease, otherwise it's going to run rampant."

Right now, [this rancher] has 2 horses that haven't tested positive for the disease, but he's still waiting to get the blood work results back. His neighbours are checking their own herds, and he's telling anyone he's sold horses to recently to start testing.

From a financial standpoint, the federal government will provide some relief, but it's not going to come close to covering what he's lost, from a financial or emotional perspective.

"I've been around horses all my life. I've been a rancher all my life, and I've heard of it, but I guess a guy gets complacent too. Once it's on your doorstep, it's a reality check."

[According to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA), a Coggins test is an agar-gel immunodiffusion (AGID) test, and this is run by the Canadian national retrovirology centre of expertise on samples that have previously screened positive on an EIA enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test. An exception to this would be if a horse required proof of a negative AGID test result to meet a particular country's import requirements. Historically, the terms Coggins test and Coggins papers have been used to refer to all EIA testing, but this is not accurate.

From the EIA fact sheet (http://www.inspection.gc.ca/animals/terrestrial-animals/diseases/reportable/eia/fact-sheet/eng/1329554028418/1329554166646):

"What is equine infectious anemia?
Equine infectious anemia (EIA) is a potentially fatal viral disease affecting horses and other members of the equine family, such as donkeys and mules.

EIA-infected animals remain carriers of the virus for life and can be a source of infection for other animals.

Is EIA a risk to human health?
No. There is no human health risk associated with EIA.

What are the clinical signs of EIA?
The incubation period is generally 2-4 weeks but may range from one week to 3 months. Infected horses may show the following signs:
- anorexia;
- depression;
- general weakness;
- intermittent fever up to 41 C [105 F];
- jaundice;
- small hemorrhages under the tongue and eye;
- swelling of the extremities; and
- weight loss.

In some cases, a loss of coordination may be the only clinical sign. Foals infected prior to birth are often aborted or die within 2 months of birth. Many animals show temporary recovery from the severe stage of EIA and may even appear normal for 2-3 weeks before relapsing with similar, but less severe signs. Episodes of clinical illness are often associated with the use of steroid drugs or with periods of stress such as hard work, hot weather, racing or pregnancy.

Where is EIA found?
EIA has a worldwide distribution. The disease has existed in Canada since the 1800s and is considered to be a sporadic disease in the equine population. The occurrence of EIA in tested horses in Canada is extremely low.

How is EIA transmitted and spread?
Transmission of EIA occurs mainly through the transfer of contaminated blood from one animal to another. Insects such as horse flies, stable flies, and deer flies aid in the disease spread. Transmission may also occur when blood-contaminated objects (e.g., needles, syringes, or surgical instruments) are used on more than one animal. EIA can also be transmitted through the semen of an infected stallion. Foals can be infected before birth.

How is EIA diagnosed?
A tentative diagnosis can be made based on clinical signs, but blood tests are necessary for a definitive diagnosis.

How is EIA treated?
At this time, there is no cure for EIA, nor is there a vaccine that will prevent an animal from becoming infected. Supportive therapy may alleviate clinical signs in individual cases, but it is critical to remember that infected equines serve as a reservoir of infection for other equines.

The control of the disease is based on voluntary testing by owners, identification and destruction or life-long quarantine of infected animals, mandatory testing of imported equines, and efforts to prevent the spread of the virus by controlling insect and mechanical vectors.

What is done to protect Canadian livestock from EIA?
Equine owners can take the following precautions to reduce the risk of infection:
- use strict hygiene practices when vaccinating or collecting blood samples from equines;
- use disposable needles and syringes, and do not use the same needle on more than one equine;
- implement insect control measures;
- test equines as per equine industry standards (i.e., race tracks, shows, events, breeding stables, etc.) and whenever equines from different sources will intermingle;
- isolate all new equines until they have been tested for EIA;
- do not breed EIA-positive equines;
- abide by the national EIA control program; and
- consult your veterinarian if you suspect your equine may be infected with EIA.

The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) imposes strict regulations on the import of animals and animal products from countries where EIA is known to occur. These regulations are enforced through port-of-entry inspections done either by the Canada Border Services Agency or the CFIA. EIA is a "reportable disease" under the Health of Animals Act. This means that all suspected cases must be reported to the CFIA.

How would the CFIA respond to an outbreak of EIA in Canada?
The CFIA places movement restrictions on all premises on which EIA-infected equines are found. The EIA-infected animals and EIA susceptible animals are quarantined, and all equines on the premises are tested for the disease. Equines confirmed to be infected with EIA are either ordered destroyed or placed under permanent quarantine where possible. Owners whose animals are ordered destroyed may be eligible for compensation."

So according to the information from the CFIA, this owner could permanently quarantine his horses. So for those he has strong emotional attachment to, and will not show or leave the premises, he could keep them. - Mod.TG
