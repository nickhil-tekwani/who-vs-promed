[Sheep pox and goat pox (SGP) are viral diseases of sheep and goats characterised by fever, generalized papules or nodules, vesicles (rarely), internal lesions (particularly in the lungs), and death. Both diseases are caused by strains of capripoxvirus which can infect sheep, goats, or both.

Sheep pox virus (SPV) and goat pox virus (GPV) were once believed to be strains of the same virus, but genetic sequencing has now demonstrated them to be separate viruses. Most strains are host specific and cause severe clinical disease in either sheep or goats, while some strains have equal virulence in both species. Further complicating this is that recombination can occur between sheep and goat strains, which produce a spectrum with intermediate host preference and range of virulence. SPV and GPV cannot be distinguished from each other with serological techniques, including viral neutralisation. (http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Animal_Health_in_the_World/docs/pdf/SHEEP_GOAT_POX_FINAL.pdf).

For this specific outbreak, the only affected species mentioned were sheep, suggesting that, (like the previous outbreak?), the virus strain may be host specific.

The test used to confirm the disease was "optical microscopy". As previously noted by Mod.AS in ProMED-mail Sheep pox & goat pox - Russia: (CR) OIE, RFI 20121010.1335877, information is again needed to clarify whether or not this test refers to electron microscopy, since viruses cannot be seen by optical microscopy.
For more detailed information regarding laboratory diagnostic methodologies, vaccines, and references, please refer to Chapter 2.7.14 Sheep pox and goat pox in the latest edition of the OIE's Terrestrial Manual at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.07.14_S_POX_G_POX.pdf

The current outbreak occurred in Zabaykalsky territory where it was previously reported in 2012 (see http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?reportid=12416 and ProMED archive no 20121010.1335877).
The village of Bura is located less than 3 km (2 mi) from the Inner Mongolia region of China. Between January and December 2012 China reported 135 outbreaks of SGP, 43 of which were situated in the Inner Mongolia region (http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/statusdetail).

In addition, since this outbreak is very close to Chinese border, shepherds from Russia may have acquired (uninspected) Chinese sheep that may have been vaccinated with the live Chinese vaccine, a vaccine known to cause clinical illness. See ProMED reports archive number: 20110616.1838, 20121001.1318487 and 20120925.1308968.
Control measures: "Vaccination in response to the outbreak" was applied; however, no information is provided on the numbers of animals vaccinated and details of the vaccine used.

Finally, countries should not wait until an outbreak is over (as in this case) before sending an Immediate Report. Mod CRD/AS/JW
