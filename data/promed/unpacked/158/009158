Restaurants and retailers not to serve or sell and consumers not to eat potentially contaminated raw oysters from Korea

Audience
--------
Restaurants and food retailers that have received shipments of frozen half-shell oysters harvested on 6 Feb 2022 from Designated Area No. II and exported by Dai One Food Co., Ltd., Republic of Korea (ROK).

Consumers, especially those who are or could become pregnant, the elderly, and persons with weakened immune systems, who have recently consumed raw oysters in Alabama (AL), California (CA), Florida (FL), Georgia (GA), Maryland (MD), New York (NY), New Jersey (NJ), Nevada (NV), North Carolina (NC), Pennsylvania (PA), South Carolina (SC), Tennessee (TN), or Virginia (VA) and suspect they have food poisoning should seek medical care immediately.

Product
-------
Frozen half-shell oysters harvested on 6 Feb 2022 from Designated Area No. II, Dai One Food Co., ROK. The oysters were shipped from the ROK and distributed in the following states: Alabama (AL), California (CA), Florida (FL), Georgia (GA), Maryland (MD), New York (NY), New Jersey (NJ), Nevada (NV), North Carolina (NC), Pennsylvania (PA), South Carolina (SC), Tennessee (TN), and Virginia (VA).

The Korean firm has recalled frozen half-shell oysters, frozen oyster IQF, and frozen oyster block harvested from the same harvest area on 6 Feb 2022.

Purpose
-------
The FDA is advising consumers not to eat, and restaurants and food retailers not to sell, and to dispose of Dai One Food Co. frozen half-shell oysters with a harvest date of 6 Feb 2022 from Designated Area No. II and sold in the states named above.

Summary of problem and scope
------------------------------
The Southern Nevada Health District notified the FDA of 2 clusters of illnesses from individuals that consumed raw oysters at a restaurant in Las Vegas on 28 Oct 2022 and 5 Nov 2022. To date, the Southern Nevada Health District reports one confirmed and 9 potential sapovirus illnesses.

FDA actions
-----------
The FDA is issuing this alert advising consumers to not eat and restaurants and food retailers to not sell oysters harvested on 6 Feb 2022 from Designated Area No. II from Dai One Food Co in ROK due to possible sapovirus contamination. The FDA notified state contacts and the Interstate Shellfish Sanitation Conference (ISSC) of the import and harvest details.

The FDA is awaiting information on further interstate distribution of the oysters and will continue to monitor the investigation and provide assistance to state authorities as needed.

Symptoms of sapovirus
-----------------------
Sapoviruses cause a sporadic gastroenteritis, similar to norovirus, in populations ranging from children to the elderly. The infections are more frequent in children under age 5 than in adults. The most common symptoms of sapovirus are diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, and stomach pain. Other symptoms include fever, headache, and body ache. Most people infected with sapovirus begin to develop symptoms 12-48 hours after infection. Symptoms usually last 1-4 days.

[Using electron microscopy, sapovirus was 1st seen in diarrheal stool samples from the UK in 1977 and was soon known as a gastroenteritis pathogen. While the virus was first seen in the United Kingdom, the prototype strain of the genus _Sapovirus_ was from another outbreak in Sapporo, Japan, in 1982. Following is the citation and abstract for a recent publication regarding sapovirus:

Abstract
---------
Background:
Sapovirus is one of the principal agents of acute viral enteritis in children. Because it has not been routinely included in diagnostic evaluations, the epidemiology and natural history remain poorly described.

Methods:
A birth cohort of 1715 children from 8 countries contributed surveillance samples (n = 35 620) and diarrheal specimens (n = 6868) from 0 to 24 months of age. Sapovirus was detected by quantitative polymerase chain reaction concurrently to other enteropathogens using multiarray cards. Logistic regression was used to identify risk factors, and longitudinal models were employed to estimate incidence rates and evaluate evidence of protective immunity.

Results:
Sapovirus was detected in 24.7% (n = 1665) of diarrheal stools and 12.8% (n = 4429) of monthly surveillance samples. More than 90% of children were infected and 60% experienced sapovirus diarrhea in the 1st 2 years of life. Breastfeeding and higher socioeconomic status were associated with reduced incidence of infection and illness. Specimens with sapovirus detected had an increased odds of coinfection with rotavirus (odds ratio [OR], 1.6 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 1.3-2.0]), astrovirus (OR, 1.5 [95% CI, 1.3-1.7]), adenovirus (OR, 1.3 [95% CI, 1.1-1.5]), and _Shigella_ (OR, 1.4 [95% CI, 1.3-1.6]). Prior infection with sapovirus conferred a risk reduction of 22% for subsequent infection (hazard ratio [HR], 0.78 [95% CI, 0.74-0.85]) and 24% for subsequent diarrhea (95% CI, 11.0%-35.0%; HR, 0.76).

Conclusions:
Sapovirus is a common cause of early childhood diarrhea. Further research on coinfections is warranted. Evidence of acquired immunity was observed even in the absence of genotype-specific analysis for this pathogen of known genetic diversity.
