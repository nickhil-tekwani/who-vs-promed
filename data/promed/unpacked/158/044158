Re: Poliomyelitis update (46): WPV1 ES, cVDPV2 AFP & ES, Indonesia community infection 20221127.8706935
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is not easy to wade through the reports and count the number of polio cases in the present [November 2022] outbreak. It appears that there were 3 paralysed children and 3 asymptomatically infected children also. Let me quote:

"The Health Ministry's spokesperson Muhammad Syahril reported that 3 children were confirmed positive for polio in Pidie District, Aceh. The children were suddenly paralyzed without showing any symptoms." These are most probably 3 polio paralysed children who had no prodromal symptoms, typical of polio.

Again: "In early November 2022, the Health Ministry declared an extraordinary occurrence (Kejadian Luar Biasa; KLB) of polio right after detecting one case in Pidie. Thus, an epidemiological search was launched in the region in 19 healthy children who had no contact with the initial case in order to assess whether or not virus transmission had occurred in the community." "From the results of examinations of 19 children, 3 children are found positive for the poliovirus," said Syahril in a written statement, [Thu 24 Nov 2022]. The examination was conducted by applying the targeted healthy stool sampling method as recommended by the WHO. However, according to WHO guidelines, the 3 children were not included in the case criteria because they did not suffer sudden paralysis."

The WHO "Poliovirus weekly update as of [Wed 23 Nov 2022]" reported the first case of polio, with VDPV-2, the onset of paralysis on [9 Oct 2022]. It will take more time for WHO to get formal reports from Health Ministry, and for verification in WHO laboratory network. However, the present problem is definitely due to VDPV-2. As the first case was caused by type 2 virus, we may assume that all 6 infections (3 paralysed, 3 asymptomatic) were infected by VDPV-2. What might its source be? After the tOPV to bOPV switch in 2016, children in Indonesia have no access to Sabin 2 vaccine virus. Is this imported from New York, London, Israel, or an Asian or African country with cVDPV-2? We must wait for a detailed genetic workup, which will certainly be conducted by WHO.

Although the immunisation coverage levels are very low, that was not the real risk factor for the appearance of VDPV-2. I wonder what vaccine will be used to prevent further cases. Hopefully, it will be IPV and not monovalent Sabin-2 or trivalent OPV containing types 1, 2, and 3. Giving Sabin 2 vaccine will seed more lineages of VDPV-2 in this community without any type 2 immunity.

Case-to-infection ratio of VDPV-2 cannot be any higher than that of wild type 2, which is 1/1000-2000. So, 3 polio cases indicate more than 3000 to 6000 infections. Even if I am wrong and the 3 refer to healthy children, the magnitude of virus circulation is huge, as 3 of 19 healthy children (16%) were infected.

[ProMED would like to thank Prof. T Jacob John for his insightful comments. The media has been very difficult to interpret the actual number of infections vs AFP cases associated with infections. In section [2] below, the media report clarifies the count as 3 asymptomatic infections and 1 AFP-associated infection. But to play safe, we are asking for clarification from knowledgeable sources.

Prof T Jacob John rightfully raises the query of where did the VDPV2 come from as Indonesia uses only bivalent OPV (types 1 and 3) plus IPV (trivalent with types 1, 2, and 3). The answer will come when the results of genomic testing of the isolate(s) are available. This year [2022] there have been importations of VDPVs into countries that do not use OPV most notably the USA and the UK. The estimates of the number of infections with VDPV2 in Aceh is sobering.

The Ministry of Health (Kemenkes) found that there were additional children infected with the polio virus in Pidie District, Aceh. These findings were obtained from the results of stool examination through Targeted Healthy Stools Sampling according to WHO recommendations, which was carried out on children under 5 years of age who lived around the location where the first polio case was found. "From the results of the examination of 19 children, it was found that 3 children were positive for the polio virus," said a spokesperson for the Ministry of Health, dr. Muhammad Syahril in his press release, [Thu 24 Nov 2022].

Even though they were infected, the 3 children who were positive for the polio virus were not included in the 'case' criteria, because they did not meet the criteria for having acute flaccid paralysis (AFC).

"Monitoring efforts are continuing, including screening efforts from house to house to ensure there are no additional cases of wilting paralysis that have not been reported," said dr. Syahril.

The first polio case was found in Pidie District in early November 2022. The Pidie District Government has designated this as an Extraordinary Polio Event (KLB) in their area.

"Polio is very dangerous for children because the impact is permanent for life, causes paralysis, and there is no cure. However, this condition can be easily prevented through complete polio immunization, both bOPV drip immunization, and IPV injection immunization," explained Dr. Syahril. "Therefore, we must protect the future of our children by giving them complete polio immunization," he continued.

Prior to the finding of this case, the coverage of polio immunization in Aceh Province in recent years tended to be low, as shown in the graph [source url has multiple graphs worth seeing - Mod.MPP]. During the 2017-2021 period, Aceh's polio immunization coverage was always below the national average. The occurrence of the COVID-19 pandemic is also one of the reasons for the decline in polio immunization coverage in the province in 2020-2021.

In addition to low immunization, the level of cleanliness of the Acehnese population is also considered to be still not good, so that it becomes a risk factor for virus transmission. "The presence of the polio virus in the faeces of the 3 children shows that the population still lacks clean and healthy behavior. The polio virus is transmitted through the gastrointestinal tract, while community defecation activities are still carried out in rivers, not in latrines, so there is virus circulation and the potential for transmission there" said Dr. Syahril.

[3] Media overview

https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/polio-is-back-in-indonesia-sparking-vaccination-campaign/2022/11/28/b47d3bb4-6f02-11ed-867c-8ec695e4afcd_story.html


Children in school uniforms and toddlers with their parents lined up Monday [28 Nov 2022] for polio vaccinations in the Sigli town square on the northern tip of the Indonesian island of Sumatra, after 4 children were found infected with the highly contagious disease that was declared eliminated in the country less than a decade ago.

The virus was first detected in October [2022] in a 7-year-old boy suffering from partial paralysis in the province of Aceh near Sigli, and since then 3 other cases have been detected, prompting the mass immunization and information drive.

Officials say that polio immunization rates in the conservative province are well behind the rest of the country, with efforts hampered by widespread disinformation the vaccine is incompatible with religious beliefs, among other things. The government has also been prioritizing COVID-19 vaccinations since they became available.

The campaign that started Monday [28 Nov 2022] aims to vaccinate some 1.2 million children in the province, said Maxi Rein Rondonuwu, the Health Ministry's director general for disease control and prevention. "There is no cure for polio, the only treatment is prevention and the tool for prevention is vaccination," Rondonuwu said, adding that the child is still able to walk, albeit with a limp.

With some 275 million people, Indonesia is the world's 4th most populous, and the largest Muslim-majority nation. Aceh is particularly conservative and is Indonesia's only province allowed to practice Shariah, which was a concession made by the national government in 2006 to end a war with separatists.

False rumors that the polio vaccine contains pork or alcohol, prohibited according to Muslim beliefs, have proliferated, especially in rural areas, complicating vaccination efforts, said the head of the Aceh Health Office, Hanif, who only goes by one name like many Indonesians. "We cannot work alone, we need support from all parties, including religious leaders, to that people understand the importance of immunization," said Hanif.

The father of the 7-year-old who contracted polio said he had opted not to immunize his son after other villagers where he lived told him the vaccines may cause harmful chemicals or non-halal substances. "My neighbors said that my son doesn't need to be immunized and I didn't want my son to get sick because of harmful chemicals that are against Islam," the 45-year-old said.

For a mother of 3 who was getting them vaccinated on Monday [28 Nov 2022], it was simply a matter of not knowing it was necessary. She said she was convinced after health workers spelled out the risks of paralysis or death if her children were to go unvaccinated. "I didn't even know about immunization," she said.

The World Health Assembly adopted a resolution for the global eradication of polio in 1988 and since then, wild poliovirus cases have decreased by more than 99%, according to the World Health Organization. It was eliminated in Indonesia in 2014 and is today only still endemic in 2 countries -- Afghanistan and Pakistan.

Polio primarily affects children under the age of 5, according to the WHO. Unvaccinated people of any age can contract the disease, however, and sporadic cases continue to crop up.

In September [2022] in New York, for example, the state stepped up its polio-fighting efforts after the disease was detected in the wastewater in the New York City area. Officials began checking for signs of the virus there after the first case of polio in the United States was identified in July [2022] in Rockland County, which is north of the city. It was confirmed in a young adult who was unvaccinated. The statewide polio vaccination rate is 79% but Rockland's rate was lower, and New York health officials urged all unvaccinated residents, including children by 2 months of age, to get vaccinated immediately.

Last week, new poliovirus cases were found in Afghanistan, Algeria, Chad, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia and Nigeria, according to the WHO's Global Polio Eradication Initiative.

None of the 3 other children in Indonesia from the same village as the initially confirmed case, had their basic vaccinations, Rondonuwu said. "It has to be reported as an outbreak, because it had been declared eradicated in Indonesia, but it turns out that there is still wild polio virus," he said.

Rondonuwu said his ministry is keeping a close watch on the cases by doing door-to-door screening to ensure that there are no additional infections that have not been reported.

The polio virus is transmitted person-to-person, generally through the "fecal-oral" route, according to the WHO. In Indonesia, authorities have also pointed to unsanitary conditions as a probable cause of the new infections after finding out that some local residents still defecate directly into a river where children are often found playing.

Across Indonesia, polio vaccination coverage has been slipping since the outbreak of COVID-19. Despite the challenges of reaching people in the archipelago nation of 5 main islands and thousands of smaller ones, 73.4% of Indonesians are now fully vaccinated for COVID-19 and 87.5% have at least one shot. For polio, 86.8% of babies were vaccinated in their first year in 2020 nationwide, which fell to 80.7% in 2021 as the country was forced to focus most of its health facilities and workers on addressing the pandemic.

By comparison, only 50.9% of the infants born in Aceh in 2021 received a polio vaccination. It was the 2nd lowest on a national scale after West Papua, where only 43.4% of babies were vaccinated.

The nationwide decline was part of a broader drop in basic immunizations, such as for measles and rubella, according to UNICEF.

Dicky Budiman, an Indonesian epidemiologist from Australia's Griffith University, said the discovery of polio in Aceh must be responded to seriously because "the threat is real for Indonesia," noting that basic immunization coverage is still low, putting the country in a high-risk category. "This is what the government really has to pursue because it's dangerous if we don't," Budiman said. "We must move immediately by strengthening basic immunization or there will be a potential additional health disaster for Indonesia."
