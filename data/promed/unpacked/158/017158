4 people died, while 16 others were hospitalized in Zamboanga del
Norte because of a mysterious illness, health officials said Friday [1
Jul 2011].

The victims, who all live in Barangay Mantebo, Sibuco town in
Zamboanga del Norte, complained of pain and numbness in their lower
extremities. One of the patients said she started feeling numbness and
a tingling sensation in her feet and legs starting last May [2011]; 15
other villagers who experienced the same symptoms have been admitted
at the Zamboanga City Medical Center (ZCMC).

Dr. Saibzur Edding, Sibuco hospital chief, said other residents of
Mantebo were admitted to the hospital; 4 have died due to the
unidentified infection. Edding said there is no mining activity in or
near Mantebo. Fishermen also do not use either dynamite or cyanide
when fishing [thus excluding toxic chemicals used in those activities
- Mod.JW].

Dr. Maribel Felisario, ZCMC information officer, said they sent
samples of the patients' urine and blood to the Department of Health
in Manila for testing. They have also gathered samples from the
village, including water, fish and seaweeds that are reportedly part
of the patients' diet. Felisario said they have encountered similar
cases before, but "this one is different, since the patients come from
one area."

[If this is a toxin, more information regarding what these people are
eating would be nice to have. It sounds a little bit like cassava root
poisoning. However, there are other things that may cause neurological
complications and produce tingling. I don't know whether this is just
a sensory tingling, as when the blood supply is compromised, or
whether this is painful in some way. - Mod.TG]

[I agree, it sounds toxic. - Mod.LM]
