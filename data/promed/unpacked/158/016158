Louisiana tomato growers battling gray mold
-------------------------------------------
Gray mold in greenhouse tomatoes has been showing up in Louisiana in recent months.

"This gray mold, which is caused by _Botrytis cinerea_, is one of the common fungal diseases of tomatoes grown in greenhouses," explained Louisiana State University's (LSU) Raghuwinder Singh. "Initial leaf symptoms include light brown, water-soaked areas with a yellow halo."

It's believed that recent episodes of cool, wet weather -- prime conditions for the disease -- are contributing to the outbreak.

Growers should alternate fungicides with different modes of action to avoid resistance build up in gray mold.

[_Botrytis cinerea_ causes grey mould on a wide range of hosts, including many crops such as brassicas and other vegetables, fruit crops, grapevine, and peanut.

Symptoms of typical grey fungal growth and softening of tissues may appear on all aerial parts of plants, both in the field or glasshouse, and in storage. The fungus usually enters via damaged tissues, for example following frost, tipburn, mechanical damage, or insect attacks, but can also affect undamaged tissues that are in contact with infected material. Fruit damage may also be due to infection via blossoms. For tomato crops, infection through pruning scars often leads to stem canker, the most destructive form of the disease which can cause serious crop losses. Affected areas are also more susceptible to invasion by bacterial soft rots. The disease is favoured by high humidity and poor ventilation within crops.

The fungus is spread by water (such as glasshouse irrigation), wind, mechanical means (including human and insect activities), and with plant debris. It can overwinter as mycelium in soil or plant debris, but sclerotia are formed for long term survival. Disease management may include cultural practices (such as field sanitation, good crop ventilation, avoiding plant damage), use of clean planting material, and fungicides as crop sprays or prestorage treatments of fruit. No tomato cultivars are known with resistance to grey mould, but susceptibility may vary amongst different varieties.
