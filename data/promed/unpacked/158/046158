Healthy kids succumbed to swine flu: death audit
------------------------------------------------
More healthy children in the state have succumbed to influenza (H1N1) 2009
virus infection than to underlying ailments, including HIV.

A death audit of H1N1 patients in Pune's Sassoon General Hospital (which
treated the maximum number of pandemic flu cases in the state of
Maharashtra) has proved wrong the theory that better immunity in children
could shield against pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza. The trend, however, is
the reverse for adults.

The audit, conducted on 23 Oct 2009, showed that all 8 children who had
succumbed to the virus at Sassoon were healthy, not immunocompromised, a
government official said. "On the other hand, we had children with HIV/AIDS
suffering from malaria, dengue, and even cardiac ailments. They were cured
after being administered Tamiflu," he said. Sassoon [hospital] had checked
317 children for pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus infection, with 52 testing
positive.

"The state will look into the reasons why so many children tested negative
when the virus was in the air," he said. "Experts think since healthy
children fought the virus with more virulence, their immune system could
have collapsed faster," added the official. Dr Arun Jamkar, dean, BJ
Medical College, Pune, said: "Of the 44 children discharged after
successful treatment, at least 10 were suffering from underlying ailments,
but still fought the swine flu virus." The findings will be studied
further, he said.

Dr Pravin Shingare, joint director, Directorate of Medical Education and
Research, said that the findings have taken health experts by surprise.
"About 80 per cent of adults who succumbed to H1N1 were suffering from
co-morbid conditions like diabetes, hypertension, heart problems, and
HIV/AIDS."

[The state of] Maharashtra has been worst hit by pandemic (H1N1) 2009
influenza, with about 180 people losing their lives. In Mumbai, 29 people
died, among them 8 children. The city is yet to undertake a study akin to
that carried out at Sassoon General Hospital. The state government will
share the Sassoon findings with global agencies through a videoconference
on Wednesday [28 Oct 2009?]. Among the participants will be top
bureaucrats, health officers from state hospitals, the Union ministry of
health, the Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and
the World Health Organization.
