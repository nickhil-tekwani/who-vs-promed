[Infectious salmon anemia (ISA), an OIE reportable disease, is an orthomyxovirus infection of sea-farmed Atlantic salmon (_Salmo salar_), which induces a systemic and lethal condition characterized by severe anemia and variable hemorrhages and necrosis in several organs. The disease course is prolonged with low daily mortality (0.05-0.1 per cent ) typically only in a few cages, but cumulative mortality may become very high.

Initially reported in Norway in the mid-1980s, ISA in Atlantic salmon has since then been reported in Canada (New Brunswick in 1996 and Nova Scotia in 2000), the United Kingdom (Scotland in 1998), the Faroe Islands (2000, report to OIE), USA (Maine in 2001), and Chile (2002-2007). The virus has been reported from rainbow trout in Ireland in 2002 and from Coho salmon in Chile (2004).

The above and additional information on ISA are available in chapter 2.3.5 of OIE's Manual of Diagnostic Tests for Aquatic Animals 2012 at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/aahm/2010/2.3.05_ISA_2009%20.pdf. - Mod.AS
