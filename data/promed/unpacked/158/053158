[1] Colin Powell
[A] Weakened immune system and COVID breakthroughs

The tragic death of Gen. Colin Powell from COVID-19 reveals not the failure of vaccines but the inability of his fragile immune system to protect him from those who are unvaccinated, health care experts said on [Mon 18 Oct 2021].

"No matter how good our vaccines -- if we have a raging forest fire of infections among unvaccinated it will spill over and kill vulnerable vaccinated folks," wrote Dr. Ashish Jha, dean of the Brown University School of Public Health, on Twitter.

Powell, 84, the first Black U.S. secretary of state whose leadership helped shape American foreign policy, suffered from a form of white blood cell cancer, according to reports.

This cancer, called multiple myeloma, damages the immune system. So despite full vaccination, his body was unable to produce enough antibodies to fend off the COVID-19 virus. And this weak response may have waned during the months since his initial shots. He was scheduled to receive a vaccine booster last week, a spokeswoman told the New York Times, but it was postponed when Powell fell ill. He died early Monday at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center outside Washington, D.C.

People with weakened immune systems, such as Powell, rely on "herd immunity" for protection. As long as some people remain unvaccinated, the virus continues to circulate -- and can cause infection in the most vulnerable.

They're insulated only when so many other people are fully vaccinated that the virus can't find enough people to infect, then stops its spread.

"This is why we must all be vaccinated," tweeted Dr. Shikha Jain, who treats blood cancers at the University of Illinois Cancer Center in Chicago. "When enough people are vaccinated, even those who the vaccine can't fully protect will be protected."

Infections among vaccinated people are much less common than infections among unvaccinated people -- and when these so-called "breakthrough" cases occur, they tend to be milder. People have fewer symptoms that are less severe and tend to be ill for fewer days.

That's because vaccines train the immune system's white blood cells to fight infection. It's the job of these cells, our first line of defense when a pathogen strikes, to create antibodies.

Soon after infection, the cells go into high gear. Most people don't develop severe disease and recover within days.

As of [12 Oct 2021], the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had reports of 7178 deaths from COVID-19 breakthrough infections. That represents 0.004% of the more than 187 million fully vaccinated Americans.

Of those, 85% were aged 65 or older, like Powell. As we age, our immune response weakens and is less well-regulated. Additionally, like Powell, they may have suffered from other immune-related illnesses. Perhaps they took immunosuppressant drugs for diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis.

For these vulnerable people, vaccines are helpful -- but require "boosting." To protect those who do not respond well to the initial series of vaccines, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has authorized third doses of Pfizer-BioNTech's and Moderna's vaccines.

Yet vaccines are often not enough. How well the vaccine works can depend upon each patient's overall state of immunosuppression.

Also at risk are the very small group of people who cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons, such as those with a history of severe allergic reaction to an ingredient in the vaccines.

"All vulnerable people rely on the rest of their community to be vaccinated to protect them from encountering someone infected with the virus," said Dr. Kelly Moore of the Immunization Action Coalition, which partners with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to distribute vaccine information. "They need us to protect them, as we protect ourselves."

With Powell's cancer, the fast-growing malignant cells pushed out the healthy immune cells. Powell was also being treated for Parkinson's disease.

His wife, Alma, also contracted COVID-19 despite being vaccinated but responded well to the monoclonal antibody treatment Regeneron, according to CBS News.

One recent study found that 55% of multiple myeloma patients failed to fully respond to COVID-19 vaccination. This research, led by Dr. Samuel D. Stampfer of the Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta and published in the journal Leukemia, found that the Moderna vaccine triggered higher antibody levels than the Pfizer vaccine in these patients.

Additionally, there is a growing body of evidence showing that chemotherapy and other cancer treatments knock down immunity. One study of people hospitalized with COVID-19 found that those who have any type of cancer or had cancer before were several times more likely to die or need ventilation.

Also at risk are elders with heart or kidney disease, according to Jha.

"Those 2 days of fever can precipitate a heart attack or kidney failure," he wrote. "And that heart attack or kidney failure can kill them."

When there are high levels of community transmission due to unvaccinated people, "even small percentage of vaccine-breakthrough infections will be severe," said Jha. "A small percentage of a very large number is still a large number."

"Protecting vulnerable people means reducing the spread of the virus in the community," he wrote.

[Our hearts go out to Colin Powell's family and friends to whom we offer our sincerest condolences.

This report is an important clarification of what was misleadingly reported earlier in the day as death from complications associated with COVID breakthrough, with no further explanation. It is unfortunate that Colin Powell had not been well enough to receive the Pfizer booster, but perhaps even that might not have provided him with the level of immunity he would have needed to fight off infection at his age, 84, and in his state of health with exacerbating medical problems. - Mod.LK]

[B] Multiple myeloma
Date: Mon 18 Oct 2021

Multiple myeloma is among the most common blood cancers in the United States, and it disproportionately affects Black Americans. They have nearly twice the risk of developing the disease as White Americans.

Although the COVID-19 vaccines provide strong protection against severe disease and death in healthy people, multiple myeloma patients are among the immunocompromised groups who may not respond as well, studies have shown. One study published in Nature in [July 2021] showed that only 45% of multiple myeloma patients developed an adequate response to the vaccine, while 22% had a partial response. One-third had no response.

Even if vaccinated, people with multiple myeloma -- or many other health conditions -- may not be able to mount the kind of immune response a healthy person would.

"Vaccines like the COVID vaccine give our immune systems a little tiny taste or a tiny example of the COVID virus so that they produce these antibodies that put a lot of extra soldiers on guard who also specifically can attack that virus," Dr. William Cance, chief medical and scientific officer for the American Cancer Society said. "When the plasma cells that make antibodies become cancerous, they are not as adept at making the antibodies that you need for specific pathogens like the virus that causes COVID."

Studies have shown that patients with blood cancers, including multiple myeloma, had a higher risk of severe COVID-19, said Dr. Anthoni Ribas, director of the Tumor Immunology Program at the UCLA Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center and president of the American Association for Cancer Research, who has been working on this research.

Among patients with common blood cancers, only 40% to 70% produce antibodies to fight COVID-19 after vaccination, compared with 98% to 100% of healthy people, he said.

For patients with multiple myeloma it may be even fewer. "These patients are at a disadvantage to fight the virus. Even with the vaccine, the data that we have shows that people with multiple myeloma, 20% -- 30% of them do not have a good immune response to the vaccines," said Ribas.

Can an additional shot help protect people with multiple myeloma or other health conditions?

Starting in August [2021], patients with blood cancers were among the immunocompromised people eligible for a 3rd dose of the Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines. That additional dose was expected to help some mount a stronger immune response.

More adults are already eligible to receive boosters of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine, and the US Food and Drug Administration is considering boosters for the Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccine recipients, as well.

Cifrino, Powell's longtime chief of staff, told CNN that Powell had received the 2-dose Pfizer vaccine, and received a 2nd shot in February [2021]. He had been scheduled to get a booster last week, but did not receive it because he was ill.

"This is not a failure of the vaccine, but rather a failure of the person's body in whom the vaccine was administered," said Dr. David Cohn, the chief medical officer at the Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center.

It's essential that people around those with multiple myeloma -- or other immunocompromising conditions -- get vaccinated.

"It's not their fault that they can't generate a good immune response, so the key thing is to have everybody else around them fully vaccinated," Ribas said, noting that current guidelines do not recommend boosters for the caretakers of people who have a low response to the vaccine. He hopes those guidelines will change.

"We need to be able to get everyone around them well protected so they do not carry the virus to them," he said.

Abstract.
"Multiple myeloma (MM) patients are at higher risk for severe COVID-19. Their mRNA vaccination response against SARS-CoV-2 is unknown. Thus, we analyzed responses to mRNA vaccination against COVID-19 among these patients. Using an ELISA-based assay that detects IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, we determined serum antibody levels prior to immunization and 12-21 and 14-21 days following the first and 2nd vaccinations, respectively, with mRNA-1273 (Moderna) or BNT162b2 (Pfizer/ BioNTech) among 103 MM patients (96 and 7 with active and smoldering disease, respectively). We stratified patients into clinically relevant responders (over 250 IU/mL), partial responders (50-250 IU/mL, which was above pre-COVID-19 background), and nonresponders (under 50 IU/mL). Smoldering MM patients responded better than those with active disease. Only 45% of active MM patients developed an adequate response, while 22% had a partial response. Lower spike antibody levels were associated with older age, impaired renal function, low lymphocyte counts, reduced uninvolved immunoglobulin levels, and t least 2nd line of treatment), and among those not in complete remission. Patients who received mRNA-1273 vaccine had higher anti-spike antibody levels than those who were vaccinated with BNT162b2. Thus, most MM patients have impaired responses to mRNA vaccination against COVID19, and specific clinical and myeloma-related characteristics predict vaccine responsiveness."

This sad occasion should send the message loud and clear why getting vaccinated is such an important public health measure for all individuals. Its significance goes beyond the individual, to the community. This is the core of public health, protecting the quality of life and health of the population as a whole. Individuals who are immunocompromised can best be protected by others being fully vaccinated. - Mod.LK]

Abstract
Background: US population-based data on COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness (VE) for the 3 currently FDA-authorized products is limited. Whether declines in VE are due to waning immunity, the delta variant, or other causes, is debated.

Methods: We conducted a prospective study of 8 834 604 New York adults, comparing vaccine cohorts defined by product, age, and month of full-vaccination to age-specific unvaccinated cohorts, by linking statewide testing, hospital, and vaccine registry databases. VE was estimated from [1 May 2021] for incident laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases (weekly life-table hazard rates through [September 2021]) and hospitalizations (monthly incidence rates through [31 Aug 2021]).

Results: 155 092 COVID-19 cases and 14 862 hospitalizations occurred. Estimated VE for cases declined contemporaneously across age, products, and time-cohorts, from high levels beginning [1 May 2021] (1.8% delta variant prevalence), to a nadir around [10 Jul 2021] (85.3% delta), with limited changes thereafter (over 95% Delta). Decreases were greatest for Pfizer-BioNTech (-24.6%, -19.1%, -14.1% for 18-49, 50-64 years, and 65 years or older, respectively), and similar for Moderna (-18%, -11.6%, -9%, respectively) and Janssen (-19.2%, -10.8, -10.9%, respectively). VE for hospitalization for adults 18-64 years was over 86% across cohorts, without time trend. Among persons 65 years or older, VE declined from May to August [2021] for Pfizer-BioNTech (95.0% to 89.2%) and Moderna (97.2% to 94.1%). VE was lower for Janssen, without trend, ranging 85.5%-82.8%.

Conclusions: Declines in VE for cases may have been primarily driven by factors other than waning. VE for hospitalizations remained high, with modest declines limited to Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna recipients 65 years or older, supporting targeted booster dosing recommendations.

[The NYS study "observed declines in VE for cases contemporaneous with increased delta variant prevalence, and changes in prevention policies, with little variation in timing by age, product, or time-cohort, suggesting these changes may be primarily driven by factors other than immunological waning...."

Results of an earlier study published in Lancet drew different conclusions from those reported above.

VOLUME 398, ISSUE 10309, P1407-1416, OCTOBER 16, 2021. Published: 4 Oct 2021 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(21)02183-8

Summary
"Background: Vaccine effectiveness studies have not differentiated the effect of the delta (B.1.617.2) variant and potential waning immunity in observed reductions in effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 infections. We aimed to evaluate overall and variant-specific effectiveness of BNT162b2 (tozinameran, Pfizer-BioNTech) against SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19-related hospital admissions by time since vaccination among members of a large US health-care system.

"Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, we analysed electronic health records of individuals (12 years or older) who were members of the health-care organisation Kaiser Permanente Southern California (CA, USA), to assess BNT162b2 vaccine effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19-related hospital admissions for up to 6 months. Participants were required to have 1 year or more previous membership of the organisation. Outcomes comprised SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive tests and COVID-19-related hospital admissions. Effectiveness calculations were based on hazard ratios from adjusted Cox models. This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04848584.

"Findings: Between [14 Dec 14 2020, and 8 Aug 2021], of 4 920 549 individuals assessed for eligibility, we included 3 436 957 (median age 45 years [IQR 29-61]; 1 799 395 [52.4%] female and 1 637 394 [47.6%] male). For fully vaccinated individuals, effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 infections was 73% (95% CI 72-74) and against COVID-19-related hospital admissions was 90% (89-92). Effectiveness against infections declined from 88% (95% CI 86-89) during the first month after full vaccination to 47% (43-51) after 5 months. Among sequenced infections, vaccine effectiveness against infections of the delta variant was high during the first month after full vaccination (93% [95% CI 85-97]) but declined to 53% [39-65] after 4 months. Effectiveness against other (non-delta) variants the first month after full vaccination was also high at 97% (95% CI 95-99), but waned to 67% (45-80) at 4-5 months. Vaccine effectiveness against hospital admissions for infections with the delta variant for all ages was high overall (93% [95% CI 84-96]) up to 6 months.

"Interpretation: Our results provide support for high effectiveness of BNT162b2 against hospital admissions up until around 6 months after being fully vaccinated, even in the face of widespread dissemination of the delta variant. Reduction in vaccine effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 infections over time is probably primarily due to waning immunity with time rather than the delta variant escaping vaccine protection.

"Added value of this study: Our variant-specific analysis suggests that reductions in BNT162b2 effectiveness over time are likely to be primarily due to waning vaccine effectiveness rather than the delta variant escaping vaccine protection given that effectiveness against delta variant infections was more than 90% within 1 month of full vaccination, reductions in effectiveness in infections by time since being fully vaccinated were observed irrespective of SARS-CoV-2 variant, and effectiveness against hospital admissions due to the delta variant was very high over the entire study period."

Both studies point to the importance of booster doses to restore high levels of immunity. - Mod.LK]
