Calf at educational center tests positive for rabies
----------------------------------------------------
A 6 week old calf at a farm that does educational programs for middle and
elementary school children has tested positive for rabies. The Maryland
Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DHMH) said that the calf is at the
Hard Bargain Farm in Prince George's County.

Dr Katherine Feldman, DHMH state public health veterinarian, wants anyone
who may have been exposed to the rabid calf to call them. "It is critical
to identify all people who may have had contact with this calf. Rabies is a
deadly disease caused by a virus that attacks the nervous system. The virus
is transmitted in the saliva of infected animals."

When someone is bitten or exposed to the saliva of a rabid animal, there is
a series of vaccines to prevent the disease [post exposure prophylaxis -
Mod.TG]. Four doses of rabies vaccine are given over 14 days and a dose of
rabies immunoglobulin is given at the beginning of the series.

Rabies is usually found among wildlife such as raccoons, bats, skunks, and
foxes, but it can be transmitted to domestic animals. Almost 400 animals in
Maryland were diagnosed with rabies last year.

To prevent your exposure to rabies:
a. have your dogs, cats, ferrets, horses, sheep, cattle, or other pets
vaccinated against rabies;
b. keep your pet under control at all times, especially when you're traveling;
c. keep your distance from wildlife and don't feed them;
d. avoid sick animals or animals acting in an unusual manner;
e. don't leave pet food outside or garbage cans uncovered;
f. don't relocate wildlife;
g. keep bats out of your house. If one gets inside, don't touch it.

You can get more information on rabies, including rabies statistics, and
prevention and control of the disease on the DHMH website

[In many parts of the United States, rabies is most often found in
raccoons, skunks, foxes, bats, and even groundhogs. Any mammal is
susceptible to the rabies virus. Other animals including dogs, cats,
ferrets, and farm animals can get rabies if they are not vaccinated. Rabies
is rarely reported in rabbits and small rodents, such as squirrels,
hamsters, guinea pigs, gerbils, chipmunks, rats, and mice. I hasten to add,
however, just because rabies is rarely reported from these species does not
mean they may not be infected with and transmit the virus.

In the United States, the most recent human rabies cases have been
associated with bats. While it seems easy to realize when you have been
bitten by a bat, those with very small teeth may not leave marks on the
skin, and bites at night may go unnoticed.

Rabies in animals most often causes changes in behavior. For example, the
affected animal may become friendly, or aggressive. Muscles of the throat
and jaw may become paralyzed and cause drooling. This has been interpreted
mistakenly as becoming afraid of water. More accurately, it is an inability
to drink, not a fear of water. Seizures are common in animals and in human
beings. The virus in humans causes unusual tingling sensations, headaches,
fever, confusion, tightening of the throat muscles, hydrophobia (mistakenly
interpreted as fear of water but more is actually an inability to swallow.)
The disease causes rapid progression to paralysis, coma, and death. For
human beings, rabies is almost always fatal, but it is always fatal to animals.

Prevention of rabies is the best. Rabies vaccination for all pets,
including horses and other farm animals is important. If you are bitten,
please contact your local animal control agency, health department, or
police. A wild animal may be trapped, if it can be done so safely. If the
animal must be killed, try to avoid damage to the head, as the brain is
needed for rabies testing. If the animal is an owned animal, get the name,
address and telephone number of the animal's owner. If the animal has a
veterinarian, get the name of the veterinarian, the clinic name and
telephone number. If a bat is found in the room or the house, consider
treatment even if a bite cannot be documented. Remember bats can enter
through chimneys as well as windows and doors.

Rabies laws regarding a vaccinated animal as well as an unvaccinated animal
that has been exposed to a rabid animal may vary slightly and you are
encouraged to check the regulations with your state.

What is unclear about this particular article is whether or not there is a
known or suspected exposure to any rabid animal. - Mod.TG
