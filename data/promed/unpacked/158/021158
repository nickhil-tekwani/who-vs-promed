"Marion County has experienced its 1st positive case of eastern equine
encephalitis," said Dr Nathan Grossman, director of the Marion County
Health Department. "While the community does not need to be alarmed,
citizens should take extra precautions to protect themselves and their
loved ones."

This case of EEE was diagnosed in a horse residing in the Summerfield
area. While there is no vaccine to protect humans from EEE, the
disease can be prevented in horses with the use of vaccinations. The
health department advises the public to remain diligent in their
personal mosquito protection efforts. These efforts should include the
"5 D's" for prevention:
- Dusk and dawn: avoid being outdoors when mosquitoes are seeking
blood. For many species, this is during the dusk and dawn hours.
- Dress: wear clothing that covers most of your skin.
- DEET: when the potential exists for exposure to mosquitoes,
repellents containing DEET (N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide, or
N,N-diethyl-3-methylbenzamide) are recommended. Picaridin and oil of
lemon eucalyptus are other repellent options.
- Drainage: check around your home to rid the area of standing water,
which is where mosquitoes can lay their eggs.

For more information on eastern equine encephalitis or the mosquito
borne illness advisory, contact the Marion County Health Department at

This is to advise that there has been an increased mosquito borne
disease activity in areas of Holmes County. 2 of our horses have
tested positive for EEE [eastern equine encephalitis] virus. The risk
of transmission to humans has been increased.

Holmes County Health Department reminds residents and visitors to
avoid being bitten by mosquitoes that may cause encephalitis disease.
Holmes County Mosquito Control and the health department continue
surveillance and prevention efforts and encourage everyone to take
basic precautions to help limit exposure by following the department
of health recommendations.

To protect yourself from mosquitoes, you should remember "Drain and
Cover":
DRAIN standing water to stop mosquitoes from multiplying
- Drain water from garbage cans, house gutters, buckets, pool covers,
coolers, toys, flower pots, or any other containers where sprinkler or
rain water has collected.
- Discard old tires, drums, bottles, cans, pots and pans, broken
appliances, and other items that aren't being used.
- Empty and clean birdbaths and pet's water bowls at least once or
twice a week.
- Protect boats and vehicles from rain with tarps that don't
accumulate water.
- Maintain swimming pools in good condition and appropriately
chlorinated. Empty plastic swimming pools when not in use.

COVER skin with clothing or repellent
- Clothing: wear shoes, socks, and long pants and long-sleeves. This
type of protection may be necessary for people who must work in areas
where mosquitoes are present.
- Repellent: apply mosquito repellent to bare skin and clothing.
- Always use repellents according to the label. Repellents with DEET,
picaridin, oil of lemon eucalyptus, and IR3535 are effective.
- Use mosquito netting to protect children younger than 2 months old.

COVER doors and windows with screens to keep mosquitoes out of your
house
- Repair broken screening on windows, doors, porches, and patios.

Tips on repellent use
---------------------
- Always read label directions carefully for the approved usage before
you apply a repellent. Some repellents are not suitable for children.
- Products with concentrations of up to 30 percent DEET are generally
recommended. Other EPA-approved repellents contain picaridin, oil of
lemon eucalyptus, or IR3535. These products are generally available at
local pharmacies. Look for active ingredients to be listed on the
product label.
- Apply insect repellent to exposed skin, or onto clothing, but not
under clothing.
- In protecting children, read label instructions to be sure the
repellent is age-appropriate. According to the CDC, mosquito
repellents containing oil of lemon eucalyptus should not be used on
children under the age of 3 years. DEET is not recommended on children
younger than 2 months old.
- Avoid applying repellents to the hands of children. Adults should
apply repellent first to their own hands and then transfer it to the
child's skin and clothing.
- If additional protection is necessary, apply a permethrin repellent
directly to your clothing. Again, always follow the manufacturer's
directions.

DOH [Department of Health] continues to conduct statewide surveillance
for mosquito borne illnesses, including West Nile virus infections,
eastern equine encephalitis, St. Louis encephalitis, malaria, and
dengue. Residents of Florida are encouraged to report dead birds via
the website http://www.myfwc.com/bird/. For more information, visit
DOH's Environmental Public Health website at

or call your local county health department.

[Eastern equine encephalitis is a viral disease that primarily attacks
horses. The virus can be passed from the mosquito to human beings as
well. However, horses cannot pass the virus to humans.

Unfortunately the disease is often lethal to the horse, causing great
upset to the owner. It is a disease that is easily preventable with a
vaccine. The equine vaccine should be given about every 4-6 months in
high risk areas, such as along the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico coasts
or in areas that have experienced flooding.

There is no vaccine for humans. - Mod.TG]
