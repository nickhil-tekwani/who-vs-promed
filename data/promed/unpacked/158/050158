[The 7 new confirmed and 3728 suspected cases (up from 3043 suspected cases in the report of week ending 14 Jul 2019, indicate that Lassa fever virus transmission is continuing. Nigeria should be leaving the period of the year when more cases usually occur, as illustrated in the graph in Fig. 3, but more cases are still occurring. There has been a peak in case numbers between weeks 1 and 11 (1 Jan-17 Mar 2019) over the past 3 years and probably will be the case again this year (2019). There are now 149 confirmed deaths, with an increase of 9 from the week 34 reporting period. Fortunately, there are no new healthcare workers infected during this reporting period, and the total number of infected healthcare workers remains at 19. This outbreak remains widespread so far in 2019, with confirmed cases occurring in 24 states, and the number of affected LGAs remains the same at 83.

Transmission of LF virus occurs when individuals are in contact with rodent reservoir hosts' excreta or are within healthcare facilities. It would be interesting to know whether the prevalence of Lassa fever virus has been increasing in populations of rodent hosts in areas where human cases are occurring.

_Mastomys erythroleucus_ and _Hylomyscus pamfi_: http://punchng.com/nigerias-large-rat-population-threatens-lassa-fever-war/

There is no mention in the plans above of public education for avoidance of contact with these rodents and their excreta. - Mod.TY
