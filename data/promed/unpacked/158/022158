Department of Agriculture (DA) officials in the region said that it
considers the cases of salmonella infection of hogs in Sta Rita town in
Samar province now "under control," reported Dr Andrew Orais, Regional
Livestock Coordinator. "There were no reports until this time of sick pigs
from the area. We are optimistic that the cases are now controlled," said
Orais.

Records have indicated that since December last year [2008], 84 pigs have
died and almost 772 hogs were affected. 25 others were found to have been
slaughtered by owners upon detection of the symptoms of the disease. The
cases affected 7 barangays of Sta Rita. "We have been conducting a series
of animal health missions in the municipality. So far, 334 pigs had been
treated; 252 were given prophylaxis, and 87 were vaccinated," Orais
disclosed. [See comment]. He said that based on their assessment, at least
90 per cent of the swine that were treated "have recovered".

"Cases of deaths could have been prevented if only suspected animals were
reported at once and consequently given treatment. We encourage the hog
raisers to immediately contact the nearest veterinary or agriculture office
once they observe manifestations of the disease," he stressed. He said that
after receiving reports of hog mortalities in barangay Manunca in Sta Rita
last December [2008], "we immediately conducted an investigation in the area."

Laboratory tests of liver and tissue samples from the affected animals were
found positive for salmonella infection and not hog cholera. Hogs infected
with salmonella bacteria exhibit clinical signs such as loss of appetite,
high fever, diarrhea, nasal discharge, and conjunctivitis.

"We implemented the so-called biosecurity measures in order to prevent the
spread of the disease to non-affected areas; we recommended a 30 day strict
quarantine regulation in Sta Rita. This means, in particular, that movement
of hogs will be regulated through several checkpoints installed at
strategic locations. Likewise, we proposed banning the slaughter of sick
animals," he stated.

Through the Quick Response Team of DA and with the help of local officials,
certain prevention and control measures were implemented to control the
spread of the disease. "But until this time, we are intensifying our
information campaign focused on proper management practices in backyard
swine raising, observance of good hygiene and proper disposal of dead
animals. We also advise residents, especially hog owners, that if they
observe something wrong with their pigs to kindly report it immediately to
the nearest municipal agriculturist officer for proper action," he added.

The infection among the hogs was detected December last year [2008], and by
early January 2009, DA officials confirmed it as salmonella infection and
not hog cholera as was initially thought. Among factors that reportedly
trigger the infection are feed contamination, changes in weather
conditions, continuous rains, lack of proper housing and sanitation, and
poor nutrition.

[As explained in the above newswire, a pig health condition in Eastern
Visayas, detected in December 2008, was initially suspected as hog cholera
(classical swine fever, CSF). This was apparently excluded in January 2009
when salmonellosis was incriminated. It will be interesting to note on what
grounds CSF was suspected (in particular the age profile of the affected
animals), which laboratory tests have been performed, and whether
additional potential causative agents of the observed disease (allegedly
"anorexia, diarrhea, high fever and mortality") were investigated and
excluded. The more common _Salmonella_ species in pigs are _S. typhimurium_
and _S. serovar choleraesuis_. The differential diagnosis of salmonellosis
in pigs includes enteric colibacillosis of newborn pigs and weanlings,
swine dysentery, campylobacteriosis, and the septicemias of growing pigs
(which include erysipelas, classical swine fever, and pasteurellosis). In
the Philippines, Ebola-Reston virus deserves to be included as well, though
its specific clinical manifestation, if at all, is yet to be elucidated.

Septicemic salmonellosis in pigs usually responds favorably if treated
early but the intestinal form is difficult to treat.

The newswire mentions vaccination but does not specify the vaccine used.
Was that a salmonella vaccine? If affirmative, which one? A live attenuated
_S choleraesuis_ is known to be commercially available. Or was it a CSF
vaccine?
