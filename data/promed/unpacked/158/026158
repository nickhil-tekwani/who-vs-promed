PREHISTORIC EXTINCTIONS DUE TO DISEASE?

"Disease Is New Suspect in Ancient Extinctions [Science]."
New York Times, 29 April 97, C1, C7.
The cause of the mass extinctions of large mammals in North
America which occurred about 13 000 years ago is the subject
of great debate between two competing theories. One theory
is that changing climatic conditions slowly destroyed the
creatures' habitat and reduced their population. The other
theory, noting that the extinctions occurred at the same
time that humans crossed into North America, holds that
humans hunted the animals into extinction. Now Dr. Ross
D.E. MacPhee of the American Museum of Natural History has
presented a third hypothesis: deadly pathogens brought by
the humans or creatures that came with them were responsible
for killing the big mammals. This article takes a detailed
look at all three theories and the supporting evidence.
----------------------------------
The NY Times does not keep archives of its Science section on its Website.
The nutshell version runs as follows. North America was populated by herds
of large herbivores, such as mammoths, mastodons, stag-moose, camels,
horses, giant ground sloth & giant beaver. Within about 400 years of man's
arrival there, those herds had been wiped out.
Man entered the New World from the Old, bringing with him pets and pests,
such as hunting dogs and rats, carrying diseases previously unknown to the
continent. These diseases spread into the large mammals, which had no
immunity and died en masse. Their reproductive cycle, being so much longer
than that of dogs and rats, did not allow them to replace their losses fast
enough to compensate, and so the species died out. Examples of modern
diseases
which could have filled the bill are leptospirosis, rabies, rinderpest and
canine distemper. These diseases, or their ancestors, could have been
responsible for that extinction.
This is seen as a more plausible theory than the hunting explanation, that
holds that "a few thousand Indian men with pointed sticks could run around
a continent and bring to extinction 135 species in maybe 400 years,"
according to Dr Ross D.E. McPhee.
The climate change theory is also seen to be weak, since the last ice age,
when the extinctions occurred, was essentially no more severe than the
several preceding ice ages.
The proponents of the disease hypothesis are McPhee, a mammalogist at the
American Museum of Natural History, and Dr Preston A. Marx, a virologist at
the Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, both in New York. They propose to
test it by examining fossils for sequences of the genomes of the pathogens
mentioned. But since the test depends on primers from exisiting disease
agents, if the pathogens responsible for the extinctions have also died out
it will be impossible to get results.
