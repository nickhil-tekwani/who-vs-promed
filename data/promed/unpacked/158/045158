Salmonellosis 1st linked to uncooked tomatoes has spread to 16
states, federal health officials said Saturday [7 Jun 2008].
Investigations by the Texas and New Mexico Departments of Health and
the Indian Health Service have tied 56 cases in Texas and 55 in New
Mexico to raw, uncooked, tomatoes.

"We're seeing a steady increase," Deborah Busemeyer, New Mexico
Department of Health communications director, said.

An additional 50 people have been sickened by the same _S._ Saintpaul
infection in Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Idaho,
Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Oklahoma, Oregon, Utah, Virginia,
Washington and Wisconsin, the CDC reported. Investigators are trying
to determine if raw tomatoes also are responsible for the illnesses
in those states, said Arleen Porcell, a CDC spokeswoman.

The source of the tomatoes responsible for the illnesses has not been
pinpointed, but health officials in Texas and New Mexico said none of
them was grown in those 2 states. At least 23 people have been
hospitalized, and no deaths have been reported, she said. Patients
ranged in age from 1 to 82.

The rarity of the Saintpaul strain and the number of illnesses
"suggest that implicated tomatoes are distributed throughout the
country," she said.

Interviews conducted with 73 people found the illnesses began between
16 Apr 2008 and 27 May 2008, Porcell said. Cherry tomatoes, grape
tomatoes, tomatoes sold with the vine still attached and homegrown
tomatoes are likely not the source of the outbreak, Busemeyer said.

Also not associated with the outbreak are raw Roma, red plum and
round red tomatoes from Arkansas, California, Georgia, North
Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Belgium, Canada, the
Dominican Republic, Guatemala, Israel, Netherlands and Puerto Rico,
according to the USA Food and Drug Association.
