Black leaf streak disease (BLSD), or black Sigatoka as it is
known in the Americas, is one of the most important diseases of
banana and plantain. BLSD is caused by the fungus _Mycosphaerella
fijiensis_ (Morelet). This pathogen is closely related to _M. musicola_
Leach, the cause of Sigatoka/yellow Sigatoka disease (SD), and the two
can only be distinguished morphologically on conidia and conidiophore
characteristics. Thickened cell walls, which are noticeable at the base
of conidia of _Paracercospora fijiensis_ (Morelet) Deighton (anamorph of
_M. fijiensis_), are absent from conidia of _Pseudocercospora musae_
(Zimm.) Deighton (anamorph of _M. musicola_). Conidia of _P. fijiensis_
are also on average longer and more flexuous than those of _P. musae_.
Conidiophores of _P. musae_ are usually short and bottle shaped
while those of _P. fijiensis_ are elongated, often bent and have
conspicuous conidial scars. The two fungi cannot be
distinguished in culture if conidia are not produced.
The two pathogens can now be differentiated in culture and in
leaf tissue by a polymerase chain reaction technique (A.
Johanson, NRI, UK). This test is proving useful in determining
distribution and spread of BLSD in areas where SD is still
prevalent.
BLSD and SD are also very difficult to differentiate on symptoms. Both
produce initial brown flecks which enlarge to form necrotic lesions with
yellow haloes and light grey centers. Lesions can coalesce and destroy
large areas of leaf tissue which results in reduced yields and premature
ripening of fruit. BLSD is more serious than SD because symptoms appear
on younger leaves and hence more damage is caused to photosynthetic
tissue. BLSD also affects many cultivars that have resistance to SD,
such as those in the plantain subgroup (AAB). Yield losses of up to 50%
have been reported.
BLSD was first recognised on the south-eastern coast of Viti Levu in
Fiji in 1963. Subsequently, the disease was reported to be present
throughout the Pacific (Torres Strait & Cape York
Peninsula region of Australia, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands,
Vanuatu, New Caledonia, Norfolk Island, Federated States of Micronesia,
Tonga, Western Samoa, Niue, Cook Islands, Tahiti and Hawaii). BLSD has
also been found in Asia (Bhutan, Taiwan, southern China including Hainan
Island, Vietnam, Philippines, West Malaysia and Sumatra in Indonesia).
However, the distribution of the disease in southeast Asia still needs
clarification especially in the Indonesian archipelago.
BLSD was identified in Latin America for the first time in 1972
in Honduras. It spread northwards to Guatemala, Belize and
southern Mexico and southwards to El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa
Rica, Panama, Colombia and Ecuador. BLSD has recently been
reported in Venezuela and Cuba from where it threatens Brazil and the
rest of the Caribbean.
In Africa, the first record was in Gabon in 1978. BLSD spread
along the west coast to Cameroon, Nigeria, Benin, Togo, Ghana,
Ivory Coast and Guinea. The disease also occurs in the Congo and spread
most likely occurred eastwards across Zaire to Burundi, Rwanda, western
Tanzania and Uganda. An independent introduction occurred on the island
of Pemba around 1987 and BLSD spread from there to Zanzibar and coastal
areas of Kenya and Tanzania. BLSD is also found in Malawi and the
Comoros Islands. The present worldwide distribution is undoubtedly
underestimated.
BLSD is disseminated locally by ascospores and conidia. Long
distance spread is believed to be by the movement of infected
suckers or diseased leaves. In the Pacific and in lowland areas of
Latin America and Africa, SD can no longer be found and may have been
completely replaced by BLSD. In plantations in Honduras, BLSD was
reported to have replaced SD in under 3 years. However, SD could still
be found in lowland areas of the
Philippines 26 years after the introduction of BLSD. SD is more adapted
to cooler temperatures and is dominant at altitudes over 1200-1400 m
where BLSD is rarely seen.
Systemic fungicides provide affective control of BLSD in
commercial plantations but their effects on the environment are
cause for concern. Although numbers of spray applications can be
appreciably reduced when used in conjunction with disease
prediction systems, it is likely that resistance to these
chemicals will develop in the future. Genetic resistance to BLSD is
clearly the best long-term goal for disease control especially for
smallholders who cannot afford to purchase chemicals. Resistance to BLSD
is usually expressed by a delay in the development of mature lesions
following infection. The more resistant the material, the longer it
takes for mature lesions to appear. On 'Pisang Awak' (ABB), mature
lesions are only seen, if at all, on the oldest (lowest) leaf. 'Pisang
Awak' and other resistant cultivate with good agronomic potential, such
as 'Yangambi km 5' (AAA), 'Pisang Ceylan' (AAB -'Mysore'), 'Pelipita
(ABB) and 'Saba' (ABB/BBB) are available and are being distributed by
INIBAP and other agencies to countries with BLSD. However, these do not
suit all local tastes and some are susceptible to _Fusarium_ wilt. BLSD
susceptible banana cultivars are being replaced in the Torres
Strait-Cape York region of Australia with resistant cultivars to act as
a buffer between Papua New Guinea, where BLSD is endemic, and commercial
growing areas in northern Queensland, where only SD is present.
Conventional _Musa_ breeding programs concentrate on the
improvement of banana and plantain germplasm utilising sources of
resistance to BLSD found in wild _Musa_ species, notably _M. acuminata_
ssp. _burmannica_, ssp. _malaccensis_ and ssp.
_siamea_, and in diploid cultivars, such as 'Paka' (AA) and
'Pisang lilin' (AA). Hybrids from breeding programs are to be
tested in the field at selected sites around the world in an
International Musa Testing Program (IMTP) organised by INIBAP
with funds from United Nations Development Programme. Although a BLSD
resistant 'Cavendish' type dessert banana has still to be developed,
much progress is being made in the improvement of
_Musa_ types for local consumption. In an earlier phase of IMTP, three
tetraploids from the Fundacion Hondurena de Investigacion Agricola
(FHIA) program were identified as having resistance to BLSD and
potential for cultivation in many countries. FHIA-01 and FHIA-02 are
dessert bananas with an apple or acidic flavour. FHIA-03 is a robust
cooking banana which may also be eaten as a dessert banana when fully
ripe. Virus tested, meristem cultures of this material are available
from INIBAP on request.
Some of the most pressing research needs are to determine what
pathogenic variability exists in _M. fijiensis_, find the
distribution of any pathogenic variants and identity sources of
resistance to these variants for incorporation in breeding
programs. Initial investigations on pathogen variability have
shown that isolates of _M. fijiensis_ from Papua New Guinea and
the South Pacific vary significantly in their reaction on
'differential' species and cultivars in glasshouse tests using
young plants derived from tissue culture (R. Fullerton, Hort
Research, New Zealand). What needs to be determined is whether
mature plants react in a similar manner as the results could be a
phenomenon associated with the inoculation of immature leaf
tissue. Observations in Western Samoa and the Cook Islands
indicate that the resistance to BLSD present in some hybrid
cultivars may be breaking down. Whether this is due to
pathogenic variants or favorable environmental conditions
resulting in severe inoculum pressure is yet to be established.
INIBAP is collaborating with Dr. X. Mourichon and Mr. J. Carlier
(CIRAD-FLHOR, France) in studies to determine the genetic diversity
within _M. fijiensis_. Initial research using RFLP analysis has shown
high levels of polymorphism. An analysis of data of a large number of
isolates has shown that genetic variability is greatest in the
Philippines and Papua New Guinea. Isolates from Africa, the Pacific
Islands and Latin America formed genetically homologous groups specific
to each region. However, groups in the Pacific and Latin America seem to
be related.
YOUR HELP IS NEEDED
Further work will be undertaken to obtain more accurate
information on the geographical distribution of genetic variants of _M.
fijiensis_ and for testing hypotheses about the origin and spread of the
pathogen. INIBAP requests that leaf samples (15 X 15 cm) from plants
suspected of being affected by BLSD be sent to Dr. Mourichon
(Laboratoire de Pathologie V'g'tale, CIRAD-FLHOR, BP 5035, 34032
Montpellier cedex 1, France) for investigation. Several specimens are
required from each plant and should include young lesions (for pathogen
identification from conidia and conidiophores) and completely necrotic
tissue (for pathogen isolation from ascospores). The leaf tissue should
be thoroughly dried between sheets of newspaper, preferably in a press,
and then wrapped in dry paper before mailing. Details of locality and
host should be included.
