As of noon on 5 Dec 2014, there have been a total of:
818 laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV, including
351 deaths,
458 recovered cases, and
9 currently active cases.

Information on newly confirmed case, 5 Dec 2014:
Taif: 70-year-old Saudi female, non-healthcare worker, currently in critical condition, history of pre-existing co-morbidities, history of possible exposure to animals and contact with suspected or confirmed cases in the healthcare environment under investigation, no history of contact with suspected or confirmed cases in the community

Information on newly reported recovery, 5 Dec 2014:
Rafha/Arar: 62-year-old Saudi male, non-healthcare worker, no history of pre-existing co-morbidities

[With the additional case reports today [5 Dec 2014] (one new confirmation and one recovery), the total number of laboratory confirmed cases reported in Saudi Arabia since June 2012 is now 818, including 351 deaths (case fatality rate 42.9 percent). The newly reported recovered case is most likely the 62-year-old Saudi male from Rafha reported on 29 Nov 2014 who at the time was reported to be in stable condition and had a history of exposure to animals.

Abstract
Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is an emerging viral pathogen that primarily causes respiratory illness. We conducted a seroprevalence study of banked human serum samples collected in 2012 from Southern Saudi Arabia. Sera from 300 animal workers (17 percent with daily camel exposure) and 50 non-animal-exposed controls were examined for serological evidence of MERS-CoV infection by a pseudoparticle MERS-CoV spike protein neutralization assay. None of the sera reproducibly neutralized the MERS-CoV-pseudotyped lentiviral vector. These data suggest that serological evidence of zoonotic transmission of MERS-CoV was not common among animal workers in Southern Saudi Arabia during July 2012.

[It would be interesting to see a repeat cross-sectional serosurvey for evidence of MERS-CoV infection in animal workers in the same area now that there have been cases reported from the study region (Jazan) in Southern Saudi Arabia near the border with Yemen. It would also be of interest to see similar serosurveys conducted in other regions where there have been sporadic cases with documented camel contact. Again, one wonders how the virus is doing the species jump, as convenience sampling of camels in Saudi Arabia and elsewhere in the Middle East and North Africa (Oman, Egypt, UAE, Kenya) have demonstrated evidence of MERS-CoV infection in the camels going back approximately 20 years. So the questions remain: What changed, and how is the virus making the jump from camels to humans, and before that, from bats to camels?
