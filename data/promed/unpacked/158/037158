Argentina: Outbreak of Hepatitis A in Neuquen Province
-----------------------------------------------
The Health Subsecretariat in Neuquen Province is launching an immunization
program against hepatitis A in San Martin de los Andes community for
children between 3 and 10 years old to battle an historic outbreak of the
disease, which already includes 55 cases, 10 more than the 45 cases
reported in 1995.
Authorities from the 4th Sanitary Region are concerned about a potential
decline in the quality of life in the area. The rapid growth of the city
and lack of adequate service infrastructure may generate conditions for the
development of certain diseases, such as enteroviral infections. The growth
of shanty towns with no adequate water supply and sewage systems may also
be a risk factor, combined with inadequate food processing and deficient
hygienic conditions.

[Hepatitis A vaccination of children (and, if feasible, also adults) may
contain effectively outbreaks of infectious hepatitis (a self-limiting
disease with little adverse outcome). However, until there is provision of
clean water and adequate disposal of sewage, the population will remain
exposed to a variety of other enteroviruses responsible for diseases with
more serious outcomes (e.g. meningitis).
