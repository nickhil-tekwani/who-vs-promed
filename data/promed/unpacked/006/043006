Some parents are concerned after a child at a daycare and preschool in North Quincy has been diagnosed with typhoid fever.

"My primary concern is the safety of my child," said one mother whose infant attends Bright Horizons daycare, as teachers and children are being tested for possible exposure to the disease.

Ann Scales, spokeswoman for the state Department of Public Health, on [Thu 10 May 2018], confirmed one case of typhoid fever in a child at Bright Horizons in North Quincy. "The Massachusetts Department of Public Health is working with Bright Horizons and the Quincy Public Health Department to prevent the spread of the disease," Scales said. Bright Horizons spokesperson Bridget Perry said center officials were told that the child had traveled abroad recently.

WBZ-TV's Dr. Mallika Marshall said typhoid fever is exceptionally rare in the USA. There are only about 300 cases in the U.S. every year, and they typically comprise travelers.

Scales said Bright Horizons has closed its center at One Enterprise Drive in North Quincy while health officials are investigating. Perry, the Bright Horizons spokesperson, said the center was closed [Wed 9 and Thu 10 May 2018] at the recommendations of public health officials.

One recommendation is to have teachers and students who were in the same classroom tested, Perry said. "We could be open if we had additional staffing but closed because teachers are being tested and testing takes several days," Perry said. She added that there is a possibility that the center may open with substitutes, but that she is still working to confirm. She said Bright Horizons is cleaning the center, even though that was not part of the recommendations it received.

In a statement, the state Department of Early Education and Care said it received notification on [8 May 2018] from Bright Horizons of a case of typhoid fever in a child at their Quincy program. "EEC is working with Bright Horizons and the Department of Public Health to ensure the health and safety of the children in the program in accordance with state requirements. The program is currently closed," the statement said.

[ProMED awaits the results of the outbreak investigation to see if additional cases occur in the household or at the daycare center. Certainly daycare centers can be the center of transmission of infectious diseases, both enterically transmitted as well as through the respiratory route.

The classical cluster of _Salmonella enterica_ serotype Typhi, in the USA occurred related to a summer house in the (still) wealthy suburb of New York City of Oyster Bay, Long Island, in August 1906. This was the still infamous cluster associated with Mary Mallon, "Typhoid Mary", an Irish immigrant who was both a food preparer and a typhoid bacillus carrier.

A number of clusters have been reported in the USA in the 21st century including:
- Columbus, OH: 9 individuals attended a pool party in 2017 where they likely came in contact with the infection.
- Colorado: 3 individuals infected in 2015 linked to a chronic carrier food handler.
- New York City: in the summer of 2000, an outbreak of endemic typhoid fever involved 6 people in Queens, NY, and a 7th person in Manhattan, NY (boroughs of New York City). An investigation by the New York City Department of Health traced the likely source to an immigrant employee working at a local restaurant (1).
- Ohio: in August 2000, the Ohio Department of Health reported a cluster of men with typhoid fever who denied having traveled abroad. To determine the cause and the extent of the outbreak, an epidemiological investigation was initiated in which 7 people in Ohio, Kentucky, and Indiana with culture-confirmed _S. enterica_ serotype Typhi infection and 2 people with probable typhoid fever were evaluated; all were men, and all but one reported having had sex with 1 asymptomatic male carrier (2).
- New York City: 2 cases of _S. enterica_ serotype Typhi infections in 2005 were acquired domestically and linked to a chronic carrier Haitian traveler.

A more classical manifestation of both typhoid and typhus, not generally discussed, is the coma vigil or "typhoid state," which may also be found with a variety of potentially fatal infectious diseases, including smallpox, anthrax, plague, yellow fever, and miliary tuberculosis.

The "typhoid state" was reviewed historically, with quotations from William Osler, George Shattuck, and Shakespeare, by Abraham Verghese (4). Verghese described it as a febrile state of semi consciousness accompanied by a muttering delirium. Among the characteristic findings can be subsultus tendinum (the twitching of fingers and wrists), carphologia (picking at bedclothes), and floccillation (picking at imaginary objects).

Enteric fever caused by _Salmonella enterica_ serotype Typhi has a totally different presentation from that of the commoner kinds of salmonellosis. Epidemiologically, typhoid is not a zoonosis like the more commonly seen types of salmonellosis. Clinically, vomiting and diarrhea are typically absent; indeed, constipation is frequently reported. As it is a systemic illness, blood cultures are at least as likely to be positive as stool in enteric fever, particularly early in the course of the infection, and bone marrow cultures may be the most sensitive.

The symptoms of classical typhoid fever typically include fever, anorexia, lethargy, malaise, dull continuous headache, non-productive cough, vague abdominal pain, and constipation. Despite the often high fever, the pulse is often only slightly elevated. During the 2nd week of the illness, there is protracted fever and mental dullness, classically called coma vigil. Diarrhea may develop, but usually does not. Many patients develop hepatosplenomegaly. After the 1st week or so, many cases develop a maculopapular rash on the upper abdomen. These lesions ("rose spots") are about 2 cm [0.8 in] in diameter and blanch on pressure. They persist for 2-4 days and may come and go. Mild and atypical infections are common.

The word typhoid (as in typhus-like) reflects the similarity of the louse-borne rickettsial disease epidemic typhus and that of typhoid fever; in fact, in some areas typhoid fever is still referred to as abdominal typhus.
