A bat captured in Haw River tested positive for rabies Wednesday [24 Oct
2007], making it the county's 6th case this year. A Keck Road resident
might have been exposed to the bat and is under treatment, the Alamance
County Health Department says. The state's Public Health Lab tested the
animal and provided the county with results Wednesday [24 Oct 2007].

"It's important for people to report exposures from bats to the health
department so that the bat can be tested, when an exposure occurs," said
Carl Carroll, environmental health director, in a press release.

The [US] Centers for Disease Control (CDC) generally defines an exposure as
any direct contact with a live bat. Also, if a bat has been found in a room
where people have been sleeping; if an adult finds a bat in the room with a
previously unattended child; or a bat is found in the presence of a
mentally disabled or intoxicated person, you must assume that an exposure
has occurred.

Carroll encouraged residents to take action to prevent the spread of rabies
by vaccinating pets. The health department will hold a USD 5 rabies
vaccination clinic for dogs and cats at their offices at 209 North
Graham-Hopedale Road in Burlington on 3 Nov 2007 from 9 am to 1 pm. "If
people have dogs and cats that are not on their rabies vaccinations, they
cannot afford to wait," Carroll said.

Vaccinations for dogs and cats must be kept current, otherwise if the
animal is exposed to a known or suspected rabid animal, North Carolina Law
requires that the dog or cat be euthanized or quarantined for 6 months at
an approved animal control facility or a veterinarian's office at the
owner's expense.

Humans who have been exposed to rabies can be treated to prevent the
disease from developing; however rabies is almost always fatal once
symptoms develop. Those bitten by an animal should immediately wash the
wound with soap and warm water, seek medical attention and call the local
animal control or health department.

A former Alexandria resident's death from a bat bite is triggering safety
warnings around the state. The 46 year old man, from Monticello, died on 20
Oct 2007 after he was infected with rabies in mid-August [2007].

He reportedly was stacking firewood in his cabin porch in north central
Minnesota when he came in contact with a bat. At the time, he didn't
realize he'd been bitten. There was no blood or puncture marks. He felt
only a pinprick on his hand. Not realizing anything was wrong, he didn't
seek any medical care.

About a month later, he started experiencing some unusual symptoms -- a
tingling in his hand -- and soon after that, he lost his ability to talk
and move. By mid-October [2007], he was in a deep coma. By the time
physicians realized the problem could be traced to a rabid bat, it was too
late.

Treatment of rabies must begin before symptoms appear. Once a person
develops symptoms, the illness is almost always fatal, according to state
health officials.

Rabies is rare [in people?] in the United States, with only one to 3 cases
reported each year. This victim is only the 5th person to die of rabies in
Minnesota in the past century. The other 4 cases happened in 1917, 1964,
1975, and 2000. [Rabies may be rare in Minnesota, as this paragraph
implies, but there are other places in the United States where this is not
likely the case. This paragraph does not indicate if rabies is rare in
animals or people. Certainly there are places in the US where rabies in
animals is not rare. - Mod.TG]

"2 deaths in 7 years is too many," noted Ruth Lynfield, state
epidemiologist in a news release issued Tuesday [23 Oct 2007] concerning
the rabies death. "What is most saddening about these deaths is that they
could have been prevented with prompt medical attention following
exposure." The Minnesota Department of Health is working with several
health care facilities in St. Cloud and Rochester where the victim was
given care to evaluate whether any health care workers may have been
exposed to the rabies virus.

The victim's death underscores the importance of seeking prompt medical
attention if you are bitten by or may have been exposed to an animal that
could be infected with rabies, according to state health officials. Bat
exposures pose a special problem because bat bites are difficult to see and
may not be noticed. If you have any physical contact with a bat, the bat
should be captured and tested for rabies and medical advice should be
sought, health officials said.

If a bat is found in a room with an unattended child, a sleeping person or
anyone who can't reliably communicate what happened, the bat should be
captured and tested for rabies. Most recent cases of rabies in humans in
the US have been due to bat bites that were not recognized or reported,
according to the health department. People who may have been exposed to
rabies are given an injection of rabies immune globulin, and 5 doses of
rabies vaccine, given over a one-month period. Treatment is unnecessary if
the suspected animal can be captured, tested, and found to be free of the
virus.

In the case of dogs, cats, or ferrets, treatment can often be avoided if
the animal is held for observation and remains healthy for 10 days
following the bite. [The time an animal is held in quarantine may depend on
if the animal was vaccinated and which state the bite occurred in. There
seem to be subtle differences in rabies laws between the different states.
- Mod.TG] The state public health veterinarian is also reminding people
that they should get their household pets immunized against rabies. Shots
are available for dogs, cats, and ferrets.

One local county is dealing with an increase in rabies, and a lack of rain
could part of the problem. So far this year [2007], Hanover County has had
29 confirmed rabies cases. That's more than double from last year [2006].

Two of those cases include a cat and a cow, and authorities I spoke with
say it's rare and scary to see rabies in domestic animals and livestock.
They are not sure exactly what's causing the spike, but they do have a few
theories.

"There are several different reasons that we've talked about and looked
into," said Sgt Caroline Hairfield of Hanover County Animal Control. One of
those reasons is that people are building homes and businesses close to
animal habitats. "Hanover has topped the 100 thousand population mark. We
are encroaching on their territory, we are moving into their homes,"
Hairfield said.

Another possible factor is this year's [2007] lack of rain. Wild animals
are having to come out for water and food. Whatever the reason, the bottom
line is that more wild animals are interacting with domestic animals and
livestock, spreading a fatal and dangerous disease. Any mammal, including
humans, can get rabies, and that's why it's so important to make sure your
animals are vaccinated.

[Rabies is not a disease to be taken lightly. It can kill people and
animals. Vaccination of animals (including horses and cattle) is for their
protection as well as that of the owners and other people. The human
population is encroaching upon the habitat of wild animals, which increases
the potential for contact with human beings. The lack of water in many
places along the eastern seaboard may well be driving animals to look for
water, and even food, in places where they may not normally be found. Bats
may be the most dangerous as they can bite without humans being aware of
it. - Mod.TG
