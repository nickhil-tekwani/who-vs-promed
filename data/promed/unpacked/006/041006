Nagpur [district] oranges are succumbing to a fungal infection brought on by excess rain. Some farmers are quoting an 80% loss of the produce already being harvested. ICAR [Indian Council of Agricultural Research said] that there has been a 40% to 50% dip in production due to a fungal infection called `phytophthora palmvora'. "The atmospheric humidity is around 90% to 95%. Such conditions favour the growth of this fungus."

[ICAR] said the fungus is invading developing fruits and causing brown rot. "The institute had issued a timely advisory to farmers for fungi control. Some farmers have benefited." [An] orange grower said, "The entire Nagpur orange belt may be left with just 20% of the produce. We have experienced 80% fruit dropping and full-grown oranges are getting affected by the fungus."

[The fungus-like organism (oomycete) _Phytophthora palmivora_ (Pp) is a very common pathogen in tropical environments causing rotting diseases on more than 150 host species. It is associated with black pod of cocoa and bud rot of palms, with both diseases amongst the most devastating for the respective crops. Some other commercially important hosts are black pepper, rubber, breadfruit and papaya.

On citrus, Pp and a range of other _Phytophthora_ species can cause brown rot of fruit, as well as foot rot, gummosis or root rot of trees. Brown rot develops mainly on fruit growing near the ground when spores are splashed from the soil onto the tree. Fruit symptoms in early stages of infection may remain undetected at harvest, leading to spread of the pathogens in storage.

The pathogens are spread by soil, wind splashed rain, mechanical means (including insect activities) and with infected plant or other material. Multiple infections from several sources may occur in plantations, with epiphytotics developing from a series of foci simultaneously. Symptom development is favoured by humidity. Disease management is difficult and needs an integrated approach, including cultural practices (phytosanitary measures, nutritional improvements), removal and burning of severely affected plants, as well as treatments with appropriate agrochemicals (for example copper compounds, commercial fungicides) at or before onset of symptoms.

Phosphorous compounds have been shown to be effective against some _Phytophthora_ diseases of trees (see previous ProMED-mail posts in the archives). They are applied as trunk injections which have to be repeated whenever protection is required, but may also be applied as dips or sprays to harvested fruit to prevent spoilage during storage. The mode of the protective action of these compounds against _Phytophthora_ species is still being investigated.
