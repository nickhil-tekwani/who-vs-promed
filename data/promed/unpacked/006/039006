Dengue-importations into Japan from East Timor-3 cases-DENV-3
-------------------------------------------------------------
In Japan, 3 travelers who visited Dili, East Timor were diagnosed with dengue fever in March 2012. One of the 3 cases was viremic upon returning to Japan, and dengue virus serotype-3 (DENV-3) was detected. The other cases were confirmed as dengue infection by anti-DENV IgM and IgG antibodies. The incidences coincide with a report of a dengue fever outbreak in East Timor: there were 161 laboratory confirmed dengue cases and 563 reports of dengue cases in East Timor this year [2012] (ProMED-mail post no. 20120306.1060914). The detection of DENV-3 among the travelers returning to Japan suggests that the serotype is currently circulating in East Timor.
