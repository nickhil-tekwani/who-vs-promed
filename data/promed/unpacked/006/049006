Three cows, 2 deer ill in north east Texas; veterinarians investigating
----------------------
Three cows and 2 captive deer on 3 premises in Cherokee County, Texas, are
being held under movement restriction by the Texas Animal Health Commission
(TAHC), pending evaluation and diagnosis of the animals' illness, signs of
which have been reported to include swollen tongues and heads and stiff
necks. Veterinarians from the TAHC, the state's regulatory agency for
livestock and poultry health, and a veterinarian from NASA, are examining
the animals to determine why they became ill.

"Debris from the Columbia space shuttle was found on the captive deer
premise, and we want to learn if the animal might have licked it or come
into close contact with a chemical residue from the pieces. According to
official reports, more than 600 pieces of debris have been found in
Cherokee County, and we don't know if there is a link between the animals'
illness and the shuttle debris," said Dr James Lenarduzzi, acting executive
director for the TAHC.

"A full evaluation is underway to determine the cause of this illness, as
we must know if we have a disease situation, or if this is a response to a
hazardous chemical substance. The animals will not be allowed to move from
the premises until we know they do not pose a health risk to other
livestock or to human health."

Dr Lenarduzzi urged livestock owners to work with their private veterinary
practitioners if their animals become ill. He reminded producers and
veterinarians that the TAHC operates a 24-hour hotline (1-800-550-8242) for
reporting unusual signs of illness or unexpected death losses in livestock
and poultry.

[Many news channels have reported how toxic the fuel from the space shuttle
was. The high heat of combustion on re-entry may have altered the toxicity,
either decreasing or increasing it. Further, if that many space shuttle
parts were spread over the county, the animals may have consumed some of
the toxic substance by licking shuttle parts or by consumption of forages.
The movement restriction should be regarded as an appropriate protective
measure. - Mod.TG]
