[According to the data on the Worldometer website, the total number of cases of COVID-19 worldwide is now 1 015 497 with 81 620 (8.0%) cases reported by China. There are now a total of 933 877 confirmed cases of COVID-19 reported from 208 countries/locations outside mainland China, representing an increase of 79 850 cases when compared with the data on 1 Apr 2020, with the USA accounting for 29 985 (37.6%), Italy for 4668 (5.8%), Spain for 7947 (10.0%), and Germany for 6813 (8.5%) of the newly confirmed cases. The total number of confirmed cases reported from outside China now represents 92.0% of the total number of reported cases. The epicenter has shifted outside of China to Western Europe and the USA. The USA now represents 24.1% of the global cases of COVID-19. The USA, Italy, Spain and Germany have overtaken China in total numbers of cases. A global total of 53 194 deaths have been reported, 49 872 (93.8%) outside mainland China.

It is now clear that while China has the largest population in the world, and was the original location where the COVID-19 outbreak started, it has markedly reduced transmission to a manageable level, now monitoring all arrivals in the country from outside. South Korea has slowly decreased daily, new case counts hovering around 100 in recent days. The USA is now number one outside China for numbers of confirmed cases of COVID-19, Italy is number 2, and Spain is number 3. Iran has slowed down in growth rate and Spain and Turkey have been accelerating. Turkey illustrates how rapidly things can increase: the 1st confirmed case was reported on 11 Mar 2020 and in 21 days the country has confirmed 18 135 cases and it now ranks number 10 out of 207 countries/territories in terms of absolute numbers of confirmed cases. - Mod.MPP]

[3] Cruise Ships
A. Ruby Princess

https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/new-zealand/2020/04/coronavirus-new-hawke-s-bay-cluster-linked-to-ruby-princess-cruise-ship-responsible-for-hundreds-of-australian-cases.html


A new COVID-19 cluster has been detected in Hawke's Bay [New Zealand], and has been linked to a cruise ship. After leaving New Zealand, the Ruby Princess sailed on to Australia, where it has been responsible for hundreds of cases. The ship is now a floating mega-cluster of COVID-19. It's currently off the coast of Australia full of sick crew.

It's the biggest known cause of the coronavirus epidemic there -- more than 430 cases and 7 deaths can be tracked to it -- all after it landed in Australia from New Zealand.

Ruby Princess' last stop had been Napier [Hawke's Bay, New Zealand], which on Friday [27 Mar 2020] became a new official cluster. It's caused a total of 13 cases in Hawke's Bay, 7 of those in the past 24 hours. The cluster has been traced back to a Hawke's Bay tour guide in contact with the ship. [The guide] infected an elderly relative at the Gladys Mary Rest Home, where 4 other residents caught it too.

A bus driver also tested positive, and Newshub understands Kiwi Ruby Princess passengers in other parts of New Zealand have it too. The Ruby Princess made 5 stops throughout New Zealand -- starting in Fiordland on [11 Mar 2020] and finishing in Napier on [15 Mar 2020] -- but there are questions over whether it should still have been operating as normal.

Cruise ships were actually banned in New Zealand on [14 Mar 2020] but the Ruby Princess was given an exemption, allowing it to go to the Hawke's Bay.

A Greek cruise ship leased by a Turkish company is stranded near Athens after being placed under quarantine with at least 119 passengers and crew infected with COVID-19, media reports said.

Turkish shipping company Miray International leased the Eleftherios Venizelos from Greece's ANEK Lines to carry shipyard workers to Cadiz in southern Spain, but the ship was turned away from its destination after Spain imposed travel restrictions to combat the deadly coronavirus.

When the vessel returned to Turkey, the captain rejected the Turkish authorities' decision to evacuate only the 160 Turkish citizens from the ship and leave the remaining 223 people on board, Miray International said in a statement published on Facebook.

Greek doctors have conducted tests on everyone on board the cruise liner, and 2 crew members have been transferred to hospital for treatment, Britain's Express newspaper said. Those who test positive for the virus will be kept on the ship, and all of the other passengers will be taken to secure accommodation for a 2-week quarantine, said the Express.

The saga of the cruise ships continues. The Zaandam (the boat docked off Panama for several days) has finally docked in Florida and those ill individuals requiring medical care have been taken to hospitals. The Ruby Princess (see [A] above) continues to have chains of transmission related to passengers and ports of call, in addition to the ill passengers and crew off the coast of Australia. Apparently there's a new ship now off the coast of Greece.

Once the virus is introduced to a passenger or crew member on board one of these ships, it turns the ship into a perfect incubator. A really sad part is the official response of governments refusing to let these ships dock and provide needed medical care to ill passengers and crew. It is not as though these larger ports of call are SARS-CoV-2 free zones. - Mod.MPP]

https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200402-sitrep-73-covid-19.pdf?sfvrsn=5ae25bc7_2


*The situation report includes information provided by national authorities as of 10:00 CET

Highlights
----------
- No new countries/territories/areas reported cases of COVID-19 in the past 24 hours.

- WHO has released a Medical Product Alert that warns consumers, healthcare professionals, and health authorities against a growing number of falsified medical products that claim to prevent, detect, treat, or cure COVID-19. More information is available at https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/essential-medicines/drug-alerts20/no3-2020-falsified-mp-forcovid-en.pdf?sfvrsn=cd866001_16.

- WHO is working with Iraq to increase surveillance and response capacities. WHO has printed hundreds of thousands of prevention and transmission control messages, taken mobile health teams to the streets, and delivered urgent consignments of personal protective equipment (PPE) and laboratory test kits. More information can be found at http://www.emro.who.int/irq/iraq-news/the-fight-to-contain-covid-19-in-iraq.html.

- WHO has been working with governments and partners around the world, across many areas of activity: conducting needs assessments, providing hand sanitizers and masks for health professionals, providing training on the clinical management of patients with COVID-19, collaborating with local media outlets and conducting awareness raising activities, delivering test kits, conducting simulation exercises, and shipping personal protective equipment through WHO logistical hubs. As an example, WHO EURO has released a photo story of WHO's activities in Kyrgyzstan, available at http://www.euro.who.int/en/countries/kyrgyzstan/multimedia/photo-story-covid-19-kyrgyzstan-scaling-up-its-preparedness,-readiness-and-response-capacities.

- Our understanding of the transmission of COVID-19 virus continues to improve with the evolution of the outbreak. For more information, see the 'subject in focus' section below

Subject in focus: the routes of transmission from COVID-19 patients
-------------------------------------------------------------------
As the COVID-19 outbreak continues to evolve, we are learning more about this new virus every day. Here we summarize what has been reported about transmission of the COVID-19 virus, and provide a brief overview of available evidence on transmission from symptomatic, pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic people infected with COVID-19.

Symptomatic transmission
------------------------
By way of definition, a symptomatic COVID-19 case is a case who has developed signs and symptoms compatible with COVID-19 virus infection. Symptomatic transmission refers to transmission from a person while they are experiencing symptoms.

Data from published epidemiology and virologic studies provide evidence that COVID-19 is primarily transmitted from symptomatic people to others who are in close contact through respiratory droplets, by direct contact with infected persons, or by contact with contaminated objects and surfaces (1-7). This is supported by detailed experiences shared by technical partners via WHO global expert networks, and reports and presentations by ministries of health.

Data from clinical and virologic studies that have collected repeated biological samples from confirmed patients provide evidence that shedding of the COVID-19 virus is highest in upper respiratory tract (nose and throat) early in the course of the disease (8-11). That is, within the 1st 3 days from onset of symptoms (10-11). Preliminary data suggests that people may be more contagious around the time of symptom onset as compared to later on in the disease.

Pre-symptomatic transmission
----------------------------
The incubation period for COVID-19, which is the time between exposure to the virus (becoming infected) and symptom onset, is on average 5-6 days, however, can be up to 14 days. During this period, also known as the "presymptomatic" period, some infected persons can be contagious. Therefore, transmission from a pre-symptomatic case can occur before symptom onset. In a small number of case reports and studies, pre-symptomatic transmission has been documented through contact tracing efforts and enhanced investigation of clusters of confirmed cases (12-17). This is supported by data suggesting that some people can test positive for COVID-19 from 1-3 days before they develop symptoms (6,16). Thus, it is possible that people infected with COVID-19 could transmit the virus before significant symptoms develop. It is important to recognize that pre-symptomatic transmission still requires the virus to be spread via infectious droplets or through touching contaminated surfaces.

Asymptomatic transmission
-------------------------
An asymptomatic laboratory-confirmed case is a person infected with COVID-19 who does not develop symptoms. Asymptomatic transmission refers to transmission of the virus from a person, who does not develop symptoms.

There are few reports of laboratory-confirmed cases who are truly asymptomatic, and to date, there has been no documented asymptomatic transmission. This does not exclude the possibility that it may occur. Asymptomatic cases have been reported as part of contact tracing efforts in some countries. WHO regularly monitors all emerging evidence about this critical topic and will provide an update as more information becomes available.

Terms:
- Community transmission is evidenced by chains of transmission for a large number of cases, or by increasing positive tests through routine screening of samples.
- Local transmission indicates locations where the source of infection is within the reporting location.
- Imported cases only indicates locations where all cases have been acquired outside the location of reporting.
- Under investigation indicates locations where type of transmission has not been determined for any cases.
- Interrupted transmission indicates locations where interruption of transmission has been demonstrated (details to be determined).

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 outside China now totals 204. This includes 18 countries (including 4 territories) from the Western Pacific region, 60 countries (including 7 territories) from the European region, 10 from the Southeast Asia region, 21 countries (including 1 territory) from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 51 countries (including 16 territories) from the Americas region, and 44 countries (including 2 territories) from the African region.

The Americas region is reporting 28 161 new cases (in the past 24 hours) of which 85.6% were reported by the USA, followed by Canada (4.7%) and Brazil (4.0%). The European region continues with rapid transmission, having confirmed 38 809 (53.3%) new cases and 3515 (71.5%) deaths in the 24 hours since the last WHO update, with Italy accounting for 12.3% of newly confirmed cases, Spain for 19.9% of newly confirmed cases, Germany for 15.9% of newly confirmed cases, and France for 12.3% of newly confirmed cases (bringing the total of these 4 countries accounting for 60.4% of newly confirmed cases in Europe. In the Eastern Mediterranean region, Iran reported 2987 new cases representing 76.8% of the regional newly reported cases. Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates represent 6.5%, 4.0%, and 3.9% respectively. In the African region, Algeria reported 41.8% of the newly reported cases in the past 24 hours, followed by Niger with 8.6% and Ghana at 6.8%. of the newly reported cases in the region. In the Western Pacific region, Australia reported 24.2% of the newly confirmed cases followed by the Philippines at 20.4%. Japan reported 18.5% of the total (excluding China) and Malaysia 12.8%. In South East Asia, information was only available from Indonesia.

Figure 2. Epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases reported outside of China, by date of report and WHO region through [2 Apr 2020], at the source URL above, is an excellent representation of the epidemic starting in the Western Pacific, transitioning to multiregional activity as the virus travelled. One sees the contribution of the ongoing epidemics in Europe and now the increasing cases in the Americas region, fueled by the USA but other countries are following suit. The curve showed a lowering probably related to inconsistent reporting over the weekend and one suspects it is rebounding with today's reports.

A somewhat repetitive but necessary reminder: it is clear that the number of reported confirmed cases differs from different reporting websites and is somewhat a function of time of day the website is updated. For example, I note the time we've accessed the Worldometer website, but by the time the post is actually finished with the editing process, those numbers have at times significantly changed. Case counting is clearly a moving target, and, depending upon when the website updates, the numbers may be different. I try to start each post with the latest figures for the calendar day (the Worldometer table) and close with the figures from the start of the calendar day (the WHO tables), defining the calendar day as DST (now GMT-4). - Mod.MPP]
