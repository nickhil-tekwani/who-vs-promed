Together with Oaxaca [state], Jalisco [state] is now in 10th place
regarding the number of dengue cases [in Mexico]. The Secretariat of Health
yesterday [19 May 2009] confirmed 2 new patients from Puerto Vallarta and
Tonala, which raises the number to 126. Of these, 10 are DHF. This number
is greater than that of the same period in 2008, when 83 [dengue cases]
were recorded, acknowledged an official of the Department of Vectors and
Zoonoses, Fermina Espinosa Alcantar. Puerto Vallarta (40 cases) and
Casimiro Castillo (with 37) are the municipalities most affected. In
Guadalajara, there have been only 2 individuals ill with dengue.

A possible explanation for the increase in recorded cases is that the
states that border Jalisco, such as Colima and Michoacan, are in 1st place
in the country for [numbers of] dengue cases. "Dengue is a disease which
has a lot to do with population movements; we have had imported cases [in
individuals] who reside in the state of Jalisco, but who have vacationed in
places of high dengue incidence and return infected [with dengue virus],"
she explained.

Nationally, the state most infested by the vector that transmits the
disease [virus], the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito, is Colima, with 1014
[dengue] cases. Michoacan has 624 cases, Guerrero 548, Veracruz 538,
Sinaloa 283, Morelos 199, and Nayarit 170.

At the St Ann's Psychiatric Hospital [Port-of-Spain Trinidad], 3 staff
members have contracted the mosquitoborne [virus] disease, dengue fever.
According to hospital sources, the outbreak occurred in the chronic wards
located on the hillside section of the compound. Newsday was told that the
source of the mosquito problem could be open toilet tanks in the washrooms
of some wards, which serve as breeding sites for mosquitoes. The tanks do
not have covers.

Another source linked the mosquito problem to a river flowing through the
grounds of the hospital. Newsday has learnt that some staff have complained
of the mosquito problem and spraying was carried out. Officials of the
North-West Regional Health Authority could not be reached for comment
yesterday [19 May 2009].

[The sources of the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes that transmit dengue virus
are water catchments in and immediately around the buildings, not the
river. The river may contribute to breeding of pest mosquitoes that are not
dengue virus vectors.

[The number of] dengue cases in Bahia have reached 69 000; 51 have died
this year [2009]. The state Secretariat of Health of Bahia issued a
bulletin this Monday [18 May 2009] about dengue [cases] recorded in the
state this year [2009]. From the beginning of 2009 until 9 May [2009],
there have been 68 959 recorded dengue cases in 366 Bahia municipalities.
This number is 173 per cent higher that that registered for the same period

"The [dengue] epidemic in [neighboring] Bolivia," stated provincial
[health] minister Victor Urbani, "has been devastating, in that up to the
latest notifications which have been offered, 70 000 cases have been
recorded; and with due respect I must say that Bolivia is not a country
with adequate notification, so we must suppose that there are more cases
[than that].

"But beyond the number [of cases] that there have been, it is impossible to
avoid the arrival of dengue [virus] in our country [Argentina]. There are
no sanitary barriers, and it would be useless to [attempt to] control
movement or impede people from coming in," he stated.

Although assuredly Chaco has recorded about 13 000 [dengue] cases, he
stated that in Jujuy there have been fewer cases than in other provinces
such as Salta, Tucuman, and Catamarca. Minister Urbani reflected that in
the Jujuy area, there have been no DHF cases, attributed to the good
results of the work that has been done, which minimized the epidemic.

dengue cases with 5 deaths. Some 92 per cent of the cases have been in the
provinces of Chaco (46 per cent), Catamarca (36 per cent), and Salta (10
per cent). The report adds that the Pan American Health Organization
indicated that the factors contributing to the resurgence of dengue in
Argentina are climatic changes and infrastructural deficiencies (water,
sanitation, trash collection) in cities with accelerating increases of
human populations.

<http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-national/dengue-fever-outbreak-in-townsville-over-20090521-bg6m.html>


The dengue fever outbreak in Townsville is officially over. Queensland
Health (QH) says the outbreak, which began on 4 Jan [2009], saw 73 people
confirmed with the mosquitoborne [virus] disease. Public health physician
Dr Steven Donohue from QH says no new cases have been diagnosed since late
February [2009], but he has warned locals to remain "dengue aware" as
outbreaks are still active in Cairns and Innisfail.

"Our policy is to allow a 3 month period to elapse after the last new
dengue case has been notified before making an all-clear declaration," said
Dr Donohue. "This is just in case low level dengue transmission might still
be occurring. Now this period has elapsed, we can officially call the
outbreak over. However, with the people movement between Townsville and
Cairns, there is a chance of another dengue outbreak starting in
Townsville, so I urge all residents to stay dengue alert."

The Townsville outbreak came during a record dengue epidemic in Cairns,
with more than 900 people infected by the [dengue virus] type 3 outbreak,
which has also seeded dengue outbreaks in Yarrabah, Port Douglas, Injinoo,
and Mareeba.

On Sunday [24 May 2009], 3 cases of dengue fever have been reported from
the Vamanapuram area, leading the Health Department to initiate measures to
seek out and destroy ?"at source"? the mosquito that spreads the disease.

Officials are trying to ascertain whether the 3 cases are an indication of
a widespread outbreak of the disease in the area. District medical officer
N Sreedhar said the department had geared up to tackle the situation at
Vamanapuram.

A number of cases of fever, particularly in children, were reported from
the Neyyattinkara Taluk Hospital, Dr Sreedhar said. While this may be due
to the sudden change in the weather, a team from the Health Department
would investigate these incidents, Dr Sreedhar said.

[8] Viet Nam (Ho Chi Minh City)
Date: Sat 23 May 2009

A dengue fever room at Children's Hospital No. 1 in Ho Chi Minh City has 7
sickbeds. They were holding 28 children on Thursday [21 May 2009]. The
number sometimes reached 30.

Early onset of the monsoon has seen an unusual spurt in the disease,
brought forward by more than a month, which caught people unprepared.
Doctors have warned that mosquitoborne dengue fever cases in the city would
be more severe this year [2009].

Children's Hospital No. 1 has had between 66 and 84 child inpatients every
day since early this month [May 2009], more than twice the normal count.
The grandmother of one patient from outlying Binh Chanh District said her
grandchild was lucky, as some children have to lie on the ward's floor and
some others in the corridor. Children are lying all over the floor and
there's no space to walk, she said.

Among the 15-20 children admitted to the hospital each day with dengue
fever, half come from nearby provinces. A boy and his father from Dong Nai
Province have been out in the hospital corridor for many days. The 32 year
old father said he only brought his son into the room when doctors wanted
to examine him or give him medicine.

Le Bich Lien, head of the dengue fever ward at the hospital, said that many
doctors and parents are still unprepared and overlook dengue fever,
thinking it's not the season yet.

Children's Hospital No. 2 and the Hospital for Tropical Diseases in the
city have also started to receive more dengue fever patients than normal.
Every day, more than 30 children are being treated for dengue fever at
Children's Hospital No. 2, while the Hospital for Tropical Diseases is
admitting 10-17 adults.

Dengue fever causes the same symptoms as flu and other kinds of fever in
the 1st 3 days, Lien said, advising parents to watch carefully to recognize
when their children develop critical conditions such as hemorrhage,
vomiting, or faster heartbeats.

85 per cent of the severe cases admitted to Children's Hospital No. 1 were
children on day 4 or 5 of the disease, when the fever had gone but the
disease had turned severe. Lien said parents should only feel safe after
their children overcome the 7th day. Doctors also warned parents that
mosquitoes that caused dengue fever usually sting during daytime.

HCMC has topped the list nationwide with more than 3600 dengue fever cases
so far this year [2009], said Nguyen Huy Nga, head of the Preventive Health
and Environment Department under the Health Ministry. The country's total
has reached more than 16 600, up 20 per cent year on year. Nga said local
governments play an important role in fighting the disease.

The disease is growing faster in Kien Giang and Soc Trang provinces of the
Mekong Delta, with more than 1100 patients in each province. Climate
change, according to Nga, has caused the early onset of the rainy season
and also increased the amount of rainfall, resulting in an increase in the
number of dengue fever cases and the severity of the disease in Singapore
and Indonesia as well.

Dengue fever has been included in Viet Nam's national program to fight the
spread of dangerous infectious diseases like AIDS and tuberculosis. The
government has reserved VND 70 billion [USD 3.9 million] for the fight, Nga
said, but localities have already borrowed VND 30 billion [USD 1.2 million]
for other purposes, and there is only VND 40 billion [USD 1.6 million] left
for spraying, educating locals on preventive measures, and clean-up
operations in fever-prone areas.

It is not yet the peak season for dengue fever, but the number of people
coming down with it has increased in southern and central regions, says a
senior official of the Ministry of Health.

Nguyen Huy Nga, head of the ministry's Preventive Medicine and Environment
Department, said the rainy season has come early this year [2009] with
increased rainfall, accounting for the rise in dengue fever cases.

In the cyclical rise and fall pattern that the disease follows, 2009 is a
year of increase, and this is another factor, Nga said.

The HCM City Paediatrics Hospital No. 1 this week [week of 18 May 209] has
received between 66 and 84 patients a day, double that of the previous
month [April 2009].

Dr Le Bich Lien, head of the hospitals Dengue Fever Ward, said early onset
of the rainy season has clearly seen the number of cases begin to go up
earlier than in previous years. Typically, the number of children
contracting the disease increases in June, Lien said.

HCM City has led the country in dengue fever cases so far this year [2009],
with 3600 cases and 4 fatalities, reported by the city's Department of Health.

The number of dengue fever cases nationwide has risen to 16 600 in the 1st
5 months of the year [2009], up 20 per cent against the same period last
year [2008], according to the Preventive Medicine and Environment Department.

Dengue fever cases are also surging in the Cuu Long (Mekong) Delta
provinces of Kien Giang and Soc Trang, and the central province of Khanh Hoa.
