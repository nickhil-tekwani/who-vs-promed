We recently detected a new case of multi-resistant _M. bovis_ in a prison
inmate in Zaragoza (Spain). The patient died in February 2000. The strain
isolated is identical to the one published in AIDS 1997, 11:1237-1242. The
most important characteristics of that outbreak were:
- the causal agent is [a strain of _M. bovis_ resistant, up to now, to all
drugs
- the death rate is around 100%
- around 100 cases have been detected in Spain, the great majority in HIV
positive [people
- transmission appears to be intra-hospital (numerous hospitals have
notified cases) & by the respiratory [route (in spite of being _M. bovis_).
The new case detected had a recent history of hospitalizations &
demonstrates that the outbreak is continuing. It had the peculiarity of
being HIV negative, which raises the fear of possible spread of the
outbreak to the seronegative population.

_M. bovis_ is a relatively rare cause of TB this days thanks to both
pasteurization of milk and control programs among cows/cattle (tuberculin
skin testing and slaughter of infected animals). 0.5% of TB in France was
due to _M. bovis_ in 1995 (Robert. Int J Tuberc Lung Dis 1999:3:711) and 1%
of TB in Australia between 1970-1994 was due to _M. bovis_ (Cousins. Int J
Tuberc Lung Dis 1999:3:715). Most people with M. bovis TB had occupational
exposures.
As a member of the _M. tuberculosis_ complex, _M. bovis_ can behave just
like _M. tuberculosis_. It can cause predominately respiratory disease and
be spread by droplet nuclei. The outbreak in Spain was tracked to at least
2 hospitals. One patient died of the disease in the Netherlands.
The presence of a new case with the same strain does not imply that the
original outbreak is continuing. Many people were likely to have been
infected with _M. bovis_ during the original outbreak. Since no treatment
was given to prevent latent _M. bovis_ infections acquired during the
outbreak from progressing to active disease, one would expect periodic
cases to continue to occur over the years. Most infections in HIV-infected
persons would progress to active disease rather quickly, especially as
individuals became more immunocompromised. Some cases would occur initially
in non-HIV infected persons as well, as up to 20% of tuberculin positive
non-HIV infected adults contacts may progress to active TB. Others will
contain their initial infection--whether _M. tuberculosis_ or _M. bovis_--
only to reactivate at some later time.
The history of recent hospitalizations among the new case suggest that this
person may have been immunocompromised by factors other than HIV. These
factors could have contributed to the progression of a latent _M. bovis_
infection acquired in the past progressing to active TB. It would be
interesting to know if the new case had any possible exposures during the
original outbreak.
It is possible that there is still ongoing transmission of multiple drug
resistant _M. bovis_ in Spain, but we would need more evidence than the
presence of a new case to demonstrate this.
