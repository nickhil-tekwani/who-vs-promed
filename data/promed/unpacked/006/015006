Jim Scudamore, government chief vet, warned the public to expect the number
of new cases of FMD to be 6 or even 10 a day for the next few days. But he
insisted the disease was not spreading, and the cases reflected the number
of animals incubating the disease before the standstill on animal movements
a week ago.
***
The freezing weather conditions of the past week have almost certainly
contributed to the spread of Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD), leading
veterinary scientists said yesterday. Like the common cold virus, the virus
causing FMD survives well in cold, even sub-zero temperatures (it is frozen
by scientists when they want to keep it alive in the laboratory), and also
prefers damp, humid air and the relative darkness of heavy cloud cover. It
is easily destroyed by high temperatures, dry air and direct sunlight. High
winds and rain, snow or sleet can assist the transmission of the disease,
which lodges in the protective haven of water droplets in the atmosphere,
and can then be carried by the wind. The distance over which it can be
carried depends on atmospheric conditions, humidity, wind speed, terrain,
and whether it is carried over land or water.
Chris Bostock, director of the Institute of Animal Health in Pirbright,
Surrey, said the weather that has hit Britain over the past week was badly
suited to containment of the virus. "Being a virus, it thrives in the body
of susceptible animals and replicates there," he said. "However, its
ability to survive in the environment, and on premises and so forth, is
clearly affected by the prevailing conditions. It is clearly the case that
cold, damp conditions are better for the survival of the virus than dry,
hot ones."
The cold weather did not necessarily mean the virus would spread widely,
Professor Bostock said. It does, however, provide the right conditions for
it to survive in the soil, in the air, on buildings and on the clothing of
farm workers, allowing it to be passed on more readily than would otherwise
be the case.
The Meteorological Office, which is supplying the Ministry of Agriculture,
Fisheries and Food (MAFF) with regular information about the weather for
use in its computer models of how the disease might spread, said the
weather was likely to remain cold and wet over much of Britain until at
least the early part of next week.
The numbers of new cases of FMD over the coming days will tell us less
about the success of the containment program than the location and
character of each individual case, experts said yesterday. Inspectors have
already identified about 150 sites known to have been exposed to farms or
abattoirs that have already reported confirmed FMD infection. If new cases
emerge on those sites, there will be little cause for renewed concern. If,
however, the disease is diagnosed on farms where there has been no known
contact with an infected animal or farmer, the alarm will sound for a more
general outbreak.
The incubation period for FMD is normally no longer than 14 days, though it
can be as short as 24 hours, so scientists should have a good idea by the
middle of next week whether the outbreak has become an epidemic, or if it
has largely run its course. It is now a process of waiting for infections
that could have occurred before movement restrictions were put in place. If
the restrictions have been effective, the number of new outbreaks will soon
decline.
