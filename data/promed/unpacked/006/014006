Heyuan Municipal Government's website stated that the 1st chicken sample positive for H7N9 [in Guangdong Province] came from a poultry farm in Gaopugang of Yuancheng District in Heyuan [prefecture-level city of Guangdong]. 2 farmers, 1 technician, and 1 driver have been observed, monitored, and followed up by phone for 4 days by Heyuan disease control agencies.

All chickens in the same flock were shipped out to Dongguan [central Guangdong] for sale on 22 Apr 2013. When personnel from agricultural agencies visited the farm for inspection, there were no chickens remaining on site.

Separately, between 3-5 May 2013, 75 live poultry markets in Heyuan were closed in batches for disinfection. From 11 Apr to 2 May 2013, Heyuan municipal agricultural agencies inspected major chicken farms for H7N9 outbreaks and received no abnormal reports. Heyuan municipal forestry agencies monitored wild birds for epidemic sources and disease in 7 provincial-level reserves and found no abnormalities. There are no reports of suspected human cases of H7N9 avian influenza in Heyuan.

[The 1st public information on suspected avian influenza virus H7 in the province Guangdong became available from a local media source on 26 Apr 2013 (see commentary in ProMED-mail 20130430.1683206). It involved a chicken sampled in the Sanniao live bird wholesale market, Dongcheng, Dongguan, in central Guangdong province. It took 9 days to confirm the suspicion and to officially report that the event was, in fact, the 1st H7N9 infection in Guangdong, a province which had not recorded (yet) any human cases of H7N9. This led to the decision of the authorities to destroy nearly 90 000 birds apparently present on the wholesale market, as reported to the OIE.

According to the current Ministry of Agriculture press release, there is circumstantial evidence that the positive chicken was, in fact, part of a consignment which on 22 Apr 2013, left a farm in another location in Guangdong, namely Heyuan, for the market in Dongguan. However, no evidence of infection could be found on the farm of origin since it was found empty. Have environmental samples collected there?

So far, not a single case of H7N9 infection has been detected in any Chinese poultry farm, in spite of reported wide-scale surveillance.

The distance between Heyuan and Dongguan is some 140 km [87 mi], about twice the distance between Dongguan and Hong Kong. Was/is the wholesale market in Dongguan a source for live poultry supply to Hong Kong's consumers? - Mod.AS
