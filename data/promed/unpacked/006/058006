TUBERCULOSIS TRANSMISSION RISK IN AIDS PATIENTS
================================================
This is a request for information from my Internet colleagues on a case
presented in my hospital.

CASE HISTORY:
35 y/o Hispanic male (born in Mexico); Diagnosis - chronic pancreatitits,
AIDS (CD4 = 4), pulmonary collapse, enlarged lymph nodes, anemia, staph
septicemia, hyposomolality. Patient was hospitalized 15 days before
expiring. CXR [chest X-ray] on admission and 4 days prior to
death were negative for infiltrate or cavitation. Blood culture
collected 24 hr prior to death has just been identified as being
AFB [acid-fast bacilli] positive (by conventional method &
BACTEC); interim report - Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex, final ID to
follow; cultures being held 8 weeks to rule out presence of other
mycobacterium species. Pneumonia was being ruled out, however no
respiratory cultures were obtained prior to death.

QUESTION:
1) Acknowledging the CDC Guidelines for prevention of TB transmission in
health care facilities and the section which addresses "determining
infectiousness of TB patients"...is there any new info or thought
regarding risks of transmission from AIDS patients, with the absence of
infiltrate in the lung? Our TB screening program using CXR for
determining risk in symptomatic pulmonary patients. My assessment for
transmission risk in this case, indicates low risk of airborne
transmission. Would appreciate validation or correction in my
assessment.

Advance thanks for your input.
