Livestock Anthrax: More than a year without outbreaks in the Evaluation Are of Buenos Aires
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A demonstration of the success of proper controls.
Up to 18 months having passed without registering any outbreaks of anthrax in the Area de Evaluacion de Carbunclo Rural which consists of 30 counties in the Province of Buenos Aires where greater than 40 percent of the provincial cattle are breed and raised. This is a landscape that is extremely flat and consists of largely of alkaline soils, with streams that flow and converge facilitating the transfer of spores and the appearance of anthrax outbreaks in this Pampas region.

In 2013 there were 5 outbreaks, an 'Epidemic', in the Partidos of Olavarria and Laprida coincident with massive numbers of Tabanid flies following a period of drought then heavy rains with northerly winds resulting in numerous cattle deaths and 2 people being infected as a result of Tabanid bites. [See: Anthrax, human, livestock, 2013 - Argentina 20140318.2340739]

This region is subject to current provincial laws of compulsory livestock vaccination. At this time >70percent of the bovine population is vaccinated annually and the results of this validate the logic of this policy.

[The Argentinians are to be thoroughly congratulated for the success of their programme and years of very hard work. They can now see the eradication in the Province of Buenos Aires on the horizon. Yes, just as with the Dakotas latterly, there will be sporadic outbreaks in the next few years in herds that had not vaccinated. These failures just encourage everyone to do a better job and not procrastinate yet again over vaccination each spring, and make sure that the sporadic outbreak herds and their immediate neighbours are vaccinated. Once there is a consistent pattern and zero or singular sporadics, one can limit vaccination to, in, and around those sporadics. My rule of thumb is that with 8 totally clear years in a row eradication has been achieved, whilst staying alert to any events involving unexpected livestock deaths and making sure that each is thoroughly investigated.

Anthrax spores are robust but they are not immortal. Many years ago Max Stern told me that in his experience in Natal a field where sheep had died would stay positive for 3 years. While archival spore mortality is around 3 percent, in the field it is nearer 30 percent unless one is digging up old carcasses or waste tannery hides. Plus, in field conditions the phages are lost in 6-7 years rendering the spores apathogenic. So the major purpose of control is to not facilitate recontamination, and surveillance is to catch any untoward events and provide sound confidence in success.

We must await Ramon's complete national report as there are occasional outbreaks elsewhere in Argentina.
