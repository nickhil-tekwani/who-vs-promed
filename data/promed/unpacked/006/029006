[To date (11 Jun 2020), Bulgaria has reported 4 outbreaks of Q fever: 3 in Gabrovo and one in Shumen. The follow-up report no. 1, submitted 10 Jun 2020, related to this event is available at https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=34640.

More than 20 people have tested positive for Q fever. See ProMED-mail posting 20200521.7362087.

"Q fever is a zoonotic disease caused by the intracellular bacterium _Coxiella burnetii_. Although it has a wide and diverse host range, in animals this organism is primarily known as a cause of reproductive losses in domesticated ruminants. Clinical cases seem to be most significant in sheep and goats, with sporadic losses and occasional outbreaks that may affect up to 50-90% of the herd. _C. burnetii_ has also been implicated in abortions and stillbirths in some other mammals, though much of this research is still preliminary. Infected animals can be difficult to recognize: nonpregnant animals do not seem to have any obvious clinical signs, and seropositivity is not always correlated with shedding of the bacteria.

Humans infected with _C. burnetii_ often seroconvert without clinical signs or develop a mild, self-limited, flu-like illness. However, this organism can cause more serious syndromes, including pneumonia and reproductive losses. A few people, generally those with pre-existing abnormalities of heart valves or blood vessels, develop life-threatening sequelae. Humans commonly acquire _C. burnetii_ from parturient animals, especially ruminants, which can shed large numbers of bacteria in birth products. Aerosolized organisms from these animals are sometimes spread by the wind, occasionally travelling long distances. Windborne outbreaks can affect dozens to hundreds of people who have no direct exposure to animals." Source: Spickler, Anna Rovid. 2007.
