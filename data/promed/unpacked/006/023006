In 2014, potato spindle tuber viroid (PSTVd) was identified in a potato clone originating from a breeding company in the Netherlands. This clone was submitted for micro propagation and tested for PSTVd. This initiated actions to track the infections. PSTVd was also found at a research institute. At both locations the viroid was eradicated.

Additional surveys revealed no further infections [in seed potato lines] in the Netherlands. They included testing of each plant in all crossing glasshouses, random samples of seed potatoes [and] samples from all varieties introduced since 2009.

Spread via true seed is the most obvious route for the infections in micro propagated plants since they shared a common PSTVd-infected parent. However, [this] does not provide insight if it is the result of internal or external presence of viroid [on the seeds]. Previous experiments were unable to show mechanical transmission of PSTVd under field conditions in the Netherlands. It was concluded that germplasm poses the highest risk of introducing this viroid in potatoes in the Netherlands.

Phylogenetic analysis showed that all potato isolates from the Netherlands cluster with potato isolates from other countries and separate from PSTVd genotypes from other vegetatively propagated species, both from the Netherlands and abroad. This indicates that the [potato] isolates originate in (wild) potato accessions rather than being introduced from recent outbreaks in ornamental crops.

[_Potato spindle tuber viroid_ (PSTVd; genus _Pospiviroid_) is an important pathogen of solanaceous crops. Yield losses can be up to 65 per cent in potato and up to 50 per cent in tomato. Symptoms in potato may include spindly shoots, stunting of plants, severely distorted tubers (spindles) and delayed sprouting. In tomatoes, symptoms include leaf chlorosis and distortion, shortening of internodes, stunting of plants and absence of flowers. Capsicum plants often display only mild symptoms, and solanaceous ornamentals are often symptomless. All varieties of tomato and potato appear to be susceptible, but mild strains causing latent infections in some host cultivars exist.

PSTVd is seed transmitted in potato and tomato at a rate of up to 100 per cent, depending on the host cultivar. Tomato seed is considered an international quarantine risk (ProMED-mail post 20140122.2222560), and the viroid was shown to be present in the embryo and endosperm (see link below). Spread occurs also via infected plants or vegetative plant parts (potato seed tubers, tomato explants, tissue cultures), pollen, mechanical means and plant-to-plant contact. PSTVd is exceptionally stable and can persist in dried sap or plant residue for considerable times. Only in the presence of _Potato leafroll virus_ can PSTVd also be transmitted by an aphid vector (_Myzus persicae_). The presence of PSTVd (and other pospiviroids) in symptomless weedy hosts has been reported from several areas.

Due to the multiple potential transmission routes and the large number of host species, both epidemiology and control of PSTVd are complicated. Disease management relies mainly on removal of infected plants and other inoculum, phytosanitary procedures, as well as use of certified PSTVd-free seed and other planting material. Pospiviroids are considered an emerging phytosanitary threat worldwide because of their potential effects on a number of very important crops and the high risk of incursions via commercial imports.

In the Netherlands, an eradication programme of PSTVd in potato breeding material has been in progress and no infections were detected in commercially sold seed potatoes in 2014 and 2015. A PSTVd outbreak on seedless capsicum in southern areas (ProMED-mail post 20160422.4175522) was traced back to propagation material imported from Israel. 2 outbreaks in potato occurred in 2016, one from an unidentified source (ProMED-mail post 20160916.4491923), and one from seed tubers imported from the UK (ProMED-mail 20161020.4574403). The report above provides valuable information on the epidemiology of PSTVd under cool climate conditions and for quarantine risk assessment.
