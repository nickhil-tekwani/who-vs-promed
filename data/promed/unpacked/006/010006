Dengue fever update (Week 47, 2006)
-----------------------------------
Based on the notifiable disease surveillance system in Taiwan, during the
47th epidemiological week (19-25 Nov [2006]), 92 dengue fever (DF) cases
were reported in Taiwan, 57 of which were laboratory confirmed, including
one case of dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF). As of 25 Nov [2006], there had
been 2051 reported cases of DF nationwide this year, of those, 864 had been
confirmed, including 16 DHF cases. So far this year (2006), 2 DF deaths
have been reported from Kaohsiung City.
The cumulative number of dengue confirmed cases has increased by 234 per
cent compared with the same period last year (2005, 259 cases). Among this
year's cases, 97 were classified as imported cases, and 767 were domestic
cases. The origins of the imported cases were as follows: 32 from Viet Nam;
18 from Indonesia; 13 from the Philippines; 10 from Thailand; 8 from
Cambodia; 5 from Malaysia; 4 from Bangladesh; 3 from India; 2 from Myanmar;
one from El Salvador; and one from Madagascar.
Of the domestic cases, the main serotype (304 cases) of circulating DF
virus is DEN-3, followed by 30 cases of DEN-2, and one case of DEN-1. The
case distribution was mainly in southern Taiwan, including Kaohsiung City,
Kaohsiung County, Tainan City, Tainan County, and Pingtung County.
Moreover, in the north, there was one case in Taipei County and one case in
Keelung City.

WHO describes dengue fever as a severe, flu-like illness that affects
infants, young children, and adults but is seldom fatal. The clinical
features of dengue fever vary according to the age of the patient. Infants
and young children may have a non-specific febrile illness with rash
(although some infants and very young children may develop shock syndrome,
with sudden loss of circulating fluid volume, and die). Older children and
adults may have either a mild febrile syndrome or the classical
incapacitating disease, with abrupt onset and high fever, severe headache,
pain behind the eyes, muscle and joint pains, and rash.
Dengue hemorrhagic fever is a potentially deadly complication that is
characterized by high fever, hemorrhagic phenomena -- often with
enlargement of the liver -- and in severe cases, circulatory failure. The
illness commonly begins with a sudden rise in temperature accompanied by
facial flush and other non-specific constitutional symptoms of dengue
fever. The fever usually continues for 2 to 7 days and can be as high as
40-41 C (104-105.8 F), possibly with febrile convulsions and hemorrhagic
phenomena. In moderate DHF cases, all signs and symptoms abate after the
fever subsides. In severe cases, the patient's condition may suddenly
deteriorate after a few days of fever; the temperature drops, followed by
signs of circulatory failure, and the patient may rapidly go into a
critical state of shock and die within 12-24 hours or quickly recover
following appropriate volume replacement therapy. There is no specific
treatment for dengue fever. However, careful clinical management by
experienced physicians and nurses frequently saves the lives of DHF
patients. With appropriate intensive supportive therapy, mortality may be
reduced to less than one per cent. Maintenance of the circulating fluid
volume is the central feature of DHF case management. (Abstracted from the
