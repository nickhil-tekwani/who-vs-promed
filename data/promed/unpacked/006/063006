A Toronto-area hospital is testing 87 infants for potential exposure to tuberculosis after a staff member tested positive for the infectious disease. The Scarborough Hospital warned late last week that dozens of babies who were in its Neonatal Intensive Care Unit between 1 Apr and 18 Jul [2012] may have been exposed to the disease.

The hospital has called the tests a "precaution," saying the risk of transmission is low. "Although TB cases are on the rise in Toronto, they are extremely rare for newborns," Dr. Reena Lovinsky, an expert in infection prevention at The Scarborough Hospital, said in a statement.

Toronto Public Health has contacted the families of the 87 at-risk infants and encouraged them to bring their children to clinics at the hospital for TB testing. The at-risk infants can expect to undergo a chest X-ray and skin tests. The babies will also receive an oral medication, known as isoniazid (INH), as a preventative treatment.

According to Lovinsky, there is no further risk of transmission. The NICUs at both of the Scarborough hospital's General and Birchmount campuses remain open. Tuberculosis is a contagious but treatable disease caused by bacteria, which could result in a persistent cough and other fever-like symptoms. Newborns are especially susceptible to TB, which typically affects the lungs.

The Canadian Lung Association estimates that the disease kills more than 2 million people worldwide each year. More than 8 million are said to develop the disease every year.

[Tuberculosis (TB) is usually spread by means of aerosolized droplet nuclei, about 1-5 microns in diameter, that each contain one or 2 tubercle bacilli (http://ajrccm.atsjournals.org/cgi/content/full/169/5/55). Droplet nuclei are expelled from a person with active pulmonary, especially cavitary, tuberculosis during activities such as coughing or sneezing; the airborne particles can remain suspended in the air for several hours, depending on the environment, and can be carried by air currents.

Although not stated in the news releases above, presumably the NICU healthcare worker (HCW) has active, most likely cavitary, TB in order possibly to have infected multiple neonatal contacts. None of the infants are said to be sick and thus likely have latent TB infection (LTBI). However, children under 5 years of age with LTBI are at high risk for progressing to primary TB and its sequellae, disseminated TB, and TB meningitis. Therefore, all the children exposed to active TB must be evaluated promptly for LTBI.

A report by the US CDC highlighted the difficulty of contact tracing of infants and provision of appropriate follow-up for those exposed to a TB-infected nurse in New York City in 2003 (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5450a2.htm). Consequently, the CDC emphasized in the report the importance of annual screening for LTBI in HCWs by use of tuberculin skin test (TST), despite a history of bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination in some HCWs, or by use of interferon gamma release assays (IGRAs) and LTBI treatment programs for HCWs to prevent TB disease and subsequent healthcare-associated transmission (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5450a2.htm).

BCG vaccination is used in many developing countries with a high prevalence of TB to prevent childhood TB meningitis and miliary disease. HCWs born in developing countries frequently attribute a positive TST result to their BCG vaccination in infancy. However, in the absence of TB infection, tuberculin reactivity caused by BCG vaccination wanes over time and is unlikely to persist for more than 10 years after vaccination. Current guidelines recommend considering LTBI treatment of HCWs who have a TST result larger than 10 mm, especially if they emigrated from a country with high TB prevalence during the preceding 5 years (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5450a2.htm). A history of vaccination with BCG should not influence the decision to treat LTBI, and healthcare facilities should promote LTBI treatment for employees with positive TST results during annual screenings for TB. In any case, IGRAs can be used to replace TST in these programs (http://www.businesswire.co
m/news/home/20110627006209/en/Oxford-Immunotec-Study-Results-Show-Switching-Tuberculin and http://www.igrasymposium.com/J14_mor.pdf), because results of IGRAS are not affected by prior BCG vaccination.

The diagnosis of tuberculosis in an infant is difficult because of its nonspecific presentation, the difficulty of obtaining microbiological confirmation, and the unreliability of the tuberculin skin test. The CDC recommends that if the chest radiograph is normal, LTBI treatment should be initiated in TST-negative children 5 years of age and younger exposed to active pulmonary tuberculosis. Treatment should be continued until the results of the 2nd TST 3 months later and other medical evaluation are known (see http://www.cdc.gov/tb/publications/LTBI/treatment.htm). If the 2nd TST result is negative, treatment may be stopped (http://www.cdc.gov/tb/publications/LTBI/treatment.htm). TST is the preferred method for testing of children under the age of 5 years (http://www.cdc.gov/tb/publications/LTBI/diagnosis.htm), because of limited data on the use of IGRAs in this age group (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/PDF/rr/rr5905.pdf).

In addition to the exposed neonates, the HCW likely exposed co-workers and others, e.g., the HCW's family, who also have to be monitored for development of TB.

The Scarborough Hospital, located in east Toronto, Ontario, is a university-affiliated, 556-bed community hospital situated in an ethnically diverse community (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Scarborough_Hospital). Toronto is the largest city in Canada, with a population of about 2.6 million in 2011, and the provincial capital of Ontario (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto). It is located in Southern Ontario on the northwestern shore of Lake Ontario.
