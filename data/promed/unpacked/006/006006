[From a previous ProMED-mail post: The department warns the public
against harvesting for personal consumption. Red tide poison symptoms
include nausea and dizziness lasting for several days. Seafood such as
crab, shrimp and fish should be safe from contamination.
In Scotland harvesting and sale of crustaceans (crab, lobster, prawns) is
sometimes banned due to red tide or algal toxins.
Crabs and lobsters may eat molluscs (mussels, scallops, oysters) which
have acquired the toxin by filter feeding. Or sometimes there may be an
over-reaction by public health authorities due to the word "shellfish"
including both crustaceans and molluscs, when mainly molluscs are
affected.
In some circumstances fish may concentrate algal toxins through the food
chain, though a "red tide" incident is unlikely to cause this.
