This case will be reflected in next week's data. This will raise the total number of WPV1 cases in 2018 to 9 [see ProMED-mail report Poliomyelitis update (25): Afghanistan (HM) WPV1 20180702.5885357 for details. - Mod.MPP]
- A sub-national immunization days campaign for polio eradication is being carried out this week in 225 high risk districts of 27 provinces, primarily in the southern and eastern parts of the country, including Kabul city. Vaccinators will visit 6.4 million children under the age of 5.

Pakistan
- No new cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) were reported this week.
- The total number of officially reported WPV1 cases in Pakistan in 2018 is 3.
- The latest case had onset of paralysis on 18 May [2018], from Dukki district, Balochistan province.
- 3 new WPV1 positive environmental samples have been reported this week, 1 in Lahore district, Punjab province on [11 Jun 2018], 1 in Rawalpindi district, Punjab province, on [11 Jun 2018], and 1 in Peshawar district, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, on [9 Jun 2018].
- This week, around 11 million children will be vaccinated against polio in Pakistan.

Nigeria
- No new cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) were reported in the past week.
- 4 WPV1 cases were reported in Nigeria in 2016 and no cases have been reported in 2017 or 2018. The most recent WPV1 case (by date of onset) was reported in Monguno local government area, Borno state, with onset on [21 Aug 2016].
- 1 new circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) positive environmental sample has been reported in Jigawa state, collected on 2 May [2018].
- Since confirmation of cVDPV2 in Nigeria, virus has been isolated from environmental samples and 1 case with onset of paralysis on [15 Apr 2018].
- In response to cVDPV2 detection, the country has conducted additional acute flaccid paralysis surveillance strengthening activities including enhanced active surveillance visits, and community sampling. The programme has also carried out an extensive search for type 2 containing vaccines (tOPV/mOPV2) in the areas surrounding where the virus was detected.
- The GPEI is working with regional and country counterparts and partners to support an outbreak response.
- A round of mOPV2 vaccination covering part of Jigawa, Gombe, Bauchi, and Sokoto was implemented in May [2018] and early June [2018].

Lake Chad Basin
- The detection of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) in Nigeria continue to pose a risk to the neighbouring countries of the Lake Chad basin.
- Emergency outbreak response efforts continue across the Lake Chad basin, together with activities to fill subnational surveillance gaps across the region.
- These include efforts to vaccinate children at markets, in internally displaced persons and refugee camps, and at international borders.
- In June [2018], 1 polio vaccination campaign targeting vulnerable island populations in Chad took place. This special vaccination activity concerned the 8 health districts of Bagasola, Bol, Isseirom, Karal, Kouloudia, Liwa, Mani, and Ngouri. 124 833 children were targeted in the island villages in the Lake district and Hadjer Lamis.
- Last week [week of 25 Jun 2018], a Technical Advisory Group (TAG) meeting took place in N'Djamena, Chad. The TAG reviewed the status of the recommendations from the previous TAG, and assessed progress towards closure of the outbreak.

Central Africa
- No new cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) were reported in the past week in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).
- The country is affected by 3 separate strains of cVDPV2, in the provinces of Mongola, Maniema, and Haut Lomami/Tanganika/Haut Katanga/Ituri.
- The total number of cVDPV2 cases reported in the DRC in 2018 is 7.
- The geographic extent of the outbreak response to all 3 strains is being re-evaluated, given the confirmed spread of one of the strains to Ituri and confirmation of the 3rd strain in Mongola. The risk of further spread is magnified given the proximity of Ituri to Uganda, and known population movements between affected areas.
- The Ministry of Health, supported by WHO and partners of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative, remains fully committed to outbreak response in the affected provinces, including use of monovalent oral polio vaccine type 2 (mOPV2) across the country, in line with internationally-agreed outbreak response protocols.

Horn of Africa
- Somalia: an advance notification has been received of 1 new circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) positive contact, from a negative index case, from Dolo district, Gedo province, collected on 29 May [2018]. This is the 1st detection of cVDPV2 in Gedo province in this outbreak.
- The index case will be officially reported as cVDPV2 in next week's data.
- The Horn of Africa is currently affected by separate outbreaks of cVDPV2 and cVDPV3.
- Outbreak response to both strains is currently being implemented, in line with internationally-agreed guidelines. Large-scale supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) have been implemented in Banadir, Lower Shabelle, and Middle Shabelle regions, Somalia, with additional SIAs planned or carried out in the affected zones of the Horn of Africa. Special surveillance activities are being undertaken to determine the origin of the viral circulation.
- WHO and partners continue to support local public health authorities across the Horn of Africa in conducting field investigations and risk assessments.

Middle East
- No new cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) were reported in the past week in Syria.
- The total number of officially reported cVDPV2 cases in Syria in 2017 remains 74. There are no cases reported in 2018.
- The most recent case (by date of onset) was reported in Boukamal district, with onset on [21 Sep 2017].
- In an effort to heighten population immunity against type-2 among high risk populations, more than 5000 children aged 2-23 months have received inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) in newly accessible areas of eastern Ghouta. In addition, a total of 33 836 children under 5 years of age have received bivalent oral polio vaccine (bOPV). 23 vaccination teams were deployed between March and May 2018 through fixed centres and mobile clinics that also provided other routine immunization.
- WHO has supported further upgrades to the Syrian National Polio Laboratory, to improve poliovirus diagnostic capacity.
- All empty and expired unopened vials of monovalent oral polio vaccine type-2 (mOPV2) have been destroyed according to global guidelines, under the direct supervision of WHO staff in country.

Papua New Guinea
- The Papua New Guinea Government has declared the circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (cVDPV1) outbreak in Morobe province a National Public Health Emergency.
- 1 case of cVDPV1 and 2 cVDPV1 community contacts have been reported.
- The National Department of Health (NDOH) is closely working with GPEI partners in launching a comprehensive response. Some of the immediate steps include conducting large-scale immunization campaigns and strengthening surveillance systems that help detect the virus early. These activities are also being strengthened in neighbouring provinces.

312 Brazilian municipalities report below 50 percent polio vaccination rate
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
A report from the Brazilian Ministry of Health dated [30 Jun 2018], showed that 312 municipalities in Brazil are below the minimum immunization target against child paralysis, reports Vaaju. According to the Ministry of Health, the low vaccination rate against poliomyelitis is the lowest in the past 16 years. Brazil's minimum vaccination target rate for polio is 95 percent.

The poliomyelitis vaccine was introduced in Brazil with the 1st mass vaccination campaign conducted in the cities of Petropolis, state of Rio de Janeiro, and Santo Andre, state of Sao Paulo, in 1961. Among the municipalities at risk of recurrence of the disease is Natal, which met 42.6 percent of the vaccine coverage. The city with the lowest immunization rate was Monte das Gameleiras, with only 18.1 percent of the children up to 1 year old vaccinated. The Health Coordinator of the State Secretariat for Public Health, Maria de Lima, assures that the vaccines are in stock against poliomyelitis.

"The factors influencing vaccination rates are lack of information, low-risk perception and spread of false news," said Maria de Lima. The decline in vaccine coverage against poliomyelitis is emblematic, but low immunization also extends to other diseases such as tuberculosis, hepatitis B, diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, meningitis, measles, red dogs, mumps, and chickenpox. "The major concern is the recurrence of these diseases, some of which are already eliminated as poliomyelitis and others eradicated as measles. The low rate of vaccination can cause major health problems to newborns, and in addition to the children of other states, we are in danger of the whole of Brazil," said Maria de Lima.

[So much for the apparent "lull" in WPV1 activity; as reported by the media earlier this week (see in Poliomyelitis update (25): Afghanistan (HM) WPV1 20180702.5885357); there is confirmation of a case of WPV1 in Helmand province of Afghanistan with onset of paralysis on 1 Jun 2018. There were also 3 positive environmental samples for WPV1 in Pakistan, 2 in Punjab province (Lahore district and Rawalpindi district, 2 large cities in Punjab province, separated by 257 kilometers/160 mi, an estimated 5 hour drive by roadway), and 1 in Peshawar district, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province (approximately 144.8 km/90 mi from Rawalpindi, and 376 km/234 mi from Lahore, as the crow flies). Hence one can surmise that there is probably more than one area of introduction and circulation of the WPV1 in Pakistan.

And unfortunately, there hasn't been a lull in circulating vaccine derived poliovirus (cVDPV), with environmental positive reports from Nigeria (cVDPV2); a new cVDPV2 isolate was obtained from a contact of the "negative" index case in Gedo province, a new geographic area. The other new information with respect to the cVDPV outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo) is that there are 3 separate outbreaks of cVDPV2 ongoing in the country, based on genetic results on the isolates - Mongola (1 outbreak), Maniema (1 outbreak), and Haut Lomami/Tanganika/Haut Katanga/Ituri (1 outbreak with extension to multiple provinces).

The inclusion of the report on the vaccination coverages reported by Brazil is to highlight the potentially precarious situation in a country that was one of the leader countries in polio control and ultimately eradication in the 1980s. While there haven't been reports of cVDPV isolates from Brazil, the low vaccination coverages are definitely of concern. Brazil changed from a pure OPV (oral polio vaccines) schedule to a sequential IPV (inactivated polio vaccine), tOPV (trivalent OPV) schedule in 2012, and in 2016, switched from tOPV to bOPV (bivalent oral polio vaccine), eliminating the OPV2, as per the global recommendations. That being said, Somalia was on the list of countries that made the change to bOPV in 2016 as well, and now is dealing with a combined cVDPV2 and cVDPV3 problem. Hence, 2 years post cessation of the use of OPV2, cVDPV2 is a problem in Somalia.
