South Korea has offered to send vaccine and medical equipment to North Korea to help contain an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] in a further sign of warming cross-border ties.

The offer on Monday [25 Feb 2014] came days after North Korea confirmed cases of the highly contagious livestock disease at a pig farm in a suburb of Pyongyang.

It had spread to other areas in the capital and an adjacent county, leading to the culling of thousands of pigs, the North's official KCNA news agency reported. The agency said at least 3200 pigs had been infected; some had died but most were slaughtered.

The report expressed concern over the impact of the outbreak, which began on 8 Jan 2014, citing a lack of preventive medicine, diagnostic kits and difficulties in securing disinfectant. "In our proposal today [25 Feb 2014], we called for talks on an emergency shipment of vaccines and medical equipment to North Korea," a South Korean unification ministry official said. There had been no response from Pyongyang so far, he said.

There is a precedent for such cooperation, with South Korea having provided experts, medicine and equipment following a 2007 FMD outbreak in the North. In 2011, the entire Korean peninsula was hit by an outbreak that led to the culling of more than 3 million livestock in the South alone.

Ties between the 2 Koreas are often fraught, but in recent days, hundreds of South Koreans have crossed into the North to be reunited with family members not seen since the 1950-53 Korean War [for 9hours. - Mod.JW].
