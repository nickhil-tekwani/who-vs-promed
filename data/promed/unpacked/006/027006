----------------------------------------------------------------------
I take issue with "salmonella bacteria are not airborne". There are
numerous references stating that salmonella will remain viable in
aerosolized format, in particular _Salmonella_ Typhimurium DT104 will
retain one per cent of its infectivity in aerosol after one hour, highly
significant in the context of power-hosing, colonization of surfaces,
buildings and equipment, and the potential for dissemination of viable
salmonella cells.

[ProMED-mail thanks Jim Buckley for his comments. The posting itself
contained the statement in question and this was not directly addressed by
the Moderator. Indeed, transmission via splashes or aerosols appear to be a
mechanism of transmission of salmonellosis to man (1) or between animals (2-4).
