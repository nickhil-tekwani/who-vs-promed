Karnataka: Outbreak of Kyasanur Forest Disease the Most Serious in Years
-------------------------------------------------
In its highest incidence in recent years, the summer scourge of the
Malnad region, Kyasanur Forest Disease (KFD), or monkey fever, has
claimed 10 lives and left 253 people ill. Deaths of a large number
of monkeys have also been reported.
Nearly 70 villages in Chikmagalur, Shimoga, Uttara Kannada, and
Dakshina Kannada districts have been afflicted by the disease, which
is known to thrive under prolonged periods of dryness. As many as 800
people in 170 villages are in the suspect list as of Wed 14 May 2003,
according to the statistics gathered from various taluks [an Indian
revenue district]. Last year's poor monsoon and the continuing dry
spell is being blamed by state health officials for the outbreak of
the disease.
"The state government is vaccinating people in a 10-km radius
[around] all the affected villages. Efforts are on to get everyone in
the area vaccinated. Insecticides are being sprayed in a 5-km radius
[around] monkey deaths," said a state health official. KFD occurs
when humans come in contact with ticks. State authorities have placed
a request for fresh batches of vaccines with the Bangalore-based
Institute of Animal Health and Veterinary Biologicals (IAHVB), makers
of the KFD vaccine. IAHVB joint director Dr C. Renuka Prasad said,
"The state procured 113 000 doses last year. A verbal request has now
been made for 130 000 doses."
2 doses of the vaccine, with annual booster shots, are needed to
protect people against the disease. Once the disease occurs, it is
treated symptomatically. This year's outbreak is the highest in
recent years. Last year, 98 cases were confirmed out of the suspected
550. 6 deaths were reported. "The number of cases has been
increasing steadily in recent years. It is known to occur in cycles.
As few as 10 cases were recorded in 1999. This seems to be a peak
year," sources said. KFD was first detected in March 1957 after
reports of mass monkey deaths were reported from Shimoga.
The cause was identified as a virus, isolated from _Haemaphysalis_
spp. ticks, found on dead monkeys. KFD, which does not occur anywhere
else in the world [A closely related virus has been isolated in Saudi
Arabia (see reference below). - Mod.CP], is known to lead to 5 per
cent deaths in humans. In 1983, it infected an all-time high of 1555
people and claimed 180 lives. Some environmentalists blame widespread
deforestation for the spread of the disease. The health department
says one spell of rain will stop the infections. Health minister
Kagodu Thimappa, who is in Shimoga, was not available for comment.

[Kyasanur Forest disease was first recognized in 1957 during a fatal
epizootic of wild monkeys in Mysore (Karnataka), India. Forest
workers are particularly at risk, and mortality may reach 10 percent
in this group. The causative virus is a tick-borne virus belonging to
the genus _Flavivirus_ of the family _Flaviviridae_, which has been
isolated from ticks, monkeys, and humans. The principal vector
appears to be the tick _Haemaphysalis spinigera_, whereas the
vertebrate reservoir is uncertain. The vaccine available for control
of Kyasanur Forest disease is an inactivated virus vaccine. The
period of incubation is 3 to 8 days. The symptoms are sudden onset of
fever and severe headache, followed by back pain, severe pain in the
lower and upper extremities, inflammation of the eye, intestinal
bleeding, and some patients may develop coma or bronchopneumonia
prior to death. - Mod.CP]
