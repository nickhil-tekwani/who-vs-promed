[1] Liberia, Sierra Leone

Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf has declared a state of emergency as the country grapples with an outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus disease [EVD].

Announcing a 90-day state of emergency, President Sirleaf said the government and people of Liberia required "extraordinary measures for the very survival of our state and for the protection of the lives of our people."

Speaking on national television, she said some civil liberties might have to be suspended. Already, reports are reaching Monrovia [the capital] that a military blockade is stopping people from western regions of Grand Cape Mount and Bomi, where EVD is prevalent, from entering the capital. These counties largely rely on Monrovia for their goods, and the blockade means that the cities of Robertsport and Tubmanburg are now cut off.

One Tubmanburg resident phoned into a radio show to complain that rice, the national staple, was already in short supply in the market. The head of the National Health Workers Association said that while the state of emergency was necessary, people should have been given time to prepare. Fear has prompted hospital workers to abandon clinics, meaning many are now shut. President Sirleaf said this meant many diseases prevalent during the rainy season [starting now], such as malaria and typhoid, are going untreated and may lead to unnecessary and preventable deaths.

Security forces in Sierra Leone have now imposed a complete blockade of Kenema and Kailahun districts in eastern Sierra Leone [just across the Liberian border], only allowing access for essential services.

Officials said medical workers should consult with the CDC before returning to the USA. CDC officials avoided questions about how the 2 American health workers were infected and what treatments they were receiving, due to patient privacy policies.

A transcript of today's [5 Aug 2014] Clinician Outreach and Communication Activity (COCA) call will be posted soon on the COCA section of the CDC's website http://emergency.cdc.gov/coca/calls/index.asp.

[3] New drug
Date: 5 Aug 2014

http://www.sciencemediacentre.org/expert-reaction-to-news-reports-on-treatments-for-ebola


Prof. Tom Solomon, Director of the NIHR Health Protection Research Unit in Emerging and Zoonotic Infections, and Director of the Institute of Infection and Global Health, University of Liverpool, U.K. said:

Q1. What new treatments are being tried for Ebola virus disease?

A1. "Although there are no proven antivirus treatments for EVD, an experimental drug has been used in 2 American health care workers who became infected, with apparently encouraging results in one of them. The drug called ZMapp consists of humanized monoclonal antibodies against the virus, developed by San Diego Mapp Biopharmaceutical Inc, in collaboration with LeafBio and Defyrus Inc. It uses some of the most sophisticated techniques for drug development that we have."

Q2. How was the experimental drug developed?

A2. "The new treatment incorporates some neat scientific tricks which bring together human, mouse, and plant biology systems. Monoclonal antibodies are made by infecting a mouse with ebolavirus and then isolating the immune cells (the clonal cells) which produce specific antibody proteins against the virus. Although they are effective at neutralizing the virus, these antibodies have to be modified, or "humanized," so they are similar to human antibodies, and can thus work with the human immune system. These changes are made by altering the genes which produce the antibody proteins. The genes are injected into a tobacco plant, _Nicotiana_, which then produces large amounts of the antibody protein. The Zmapp treatment consists of 3 different monoclonal antibodies against ebolavirus proteins. So far, it has proved effective when used to treat experimentally infected monkeys. Normally, further drug development for humans would take years, with carefully controlled clinical trials. However, in emergency situations like this, when the death rate from a disease is especially high, drugs can be used on a compassionate basis, without the full set of data to support their use."

"The 1st EVD patient to receive ZMapp appeared to make a dramatic recovery within an hour, whereas in the 2nd recipient, there were no immediate effects. Such dramatic recoveries are unusual for any drug treatments, making some scientists cautious about how to interpret these findings. Full controlled clinical trials will be needed."

http://www.businessinsider.com/zmapp-serum-used-to-treat-ebola-infected-americans-2014-8#ixzz39k4g1c3y


Both of the EVD-infected U.S. citizens in Liberia received a rare dose of what news reports called a "secret serum" to treat the virus before being transported to Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, USA according to a CNN report. And while some people do fight off the disease on their own, in the case of the 2 Americans, that experimental serum may have saved their lives.

As KB and missionary NW waited in a Liberian hospital, someone from the U.S. National Institutes of Health reached out to Samaritan's Purse, one of the 2 North Carolina-based Christian relief groups the 2 were working with, and offered to have vials of an experimental drug called ZMapp sent to Liberia, according to CNN's unnamed source.

Although the Food and Drug Administration does allow experimental drugs to occasionally be distributed in life-threatening circumstances without approval under the expanded access or "compassionate use" conditions, it's not yet clear whether that approval was granted in this case or not. A spokesperson for the FDA told Business Insider that federal law and FDA regulations prohibit them from commenting on specific products, as that information is considered confidential.

An Emergency Treatment
------------------
However, it was approved, 3 frozen vials of ZMapp, a drug being developed by Mapp Biopharmaceutical, were flown to Liberia and arrived the morning of Thu 31 Jul 2014. The serum needed 8-10 hours to thaw. KB, who had been sick for 9 days already, reportedly had asked that NW receive the 1st dose, as he was younger and thought he had a better chance of surviving [It's unclear from the CNN story why the doses apparently were not all ready at the same time]. But his condition worsened as the 1st dose thawed, and CNN reports that he told his doctors, "I am going to die."

He asked for the 1st dose and had it given to him through an IV. According to CNN's source, within an hour, he was able to breathe better and a rash on his body started to fade. The next day he was able to shower without help before boarding the air ambulance that flew him to Atlanta, USA.

NW reportedly didn't respond as well to the 1st treatment she received and had to be given the 3rd vial of serum. Her 2nd treatment seemed to improve her condition, according to CNN and stabilized her enough that she is expected to fly to the USA on Tue 5 Aug 2014 [which she did].

The ZMapp serum itself is what is known as a "monoclonal antibody." These substances are created by infecting an animal with the disease in question. Then, scientists harvest and use the antibodies that the animals' immune systems create to fight the virus. In this case, the antibodies were harvested from ebolavirus-infected mice.

Studies have tested various other blends of similar therapies against ebolavirus-infected monkeys before, with some efficacy, but only when the therapy is given within 48 hours of infection. As Hamblin cautions, "very little is known about the safety and effectiveness of this treatment, so little that outside of extreme circumstances like this, it would not be legal to use."

This EVD outbreak -- the worst in history -- has already killed [932] people. But promising news of an experimental serum doesn't mean that a treatment is close. Developing a cure for a virus is complicated, and developing a treatment for Ebola has proven particularly difficult. In this case, since health officials can't comment on a specific treatment or on the patients involved for privacy reasons, we don't know the exact status of KB and NW or how that status has been affected by the serum that they reportedly received.

Before this emergency use, ZMapp had only been tested in a small number of monkeys. The company reported that all 4 monkeys who received the treatment within 24 hours of being infected survived. Half of another group of 4 monkeys who were treated within 48 hours survived. KB and NW had been sick much longer than that before being treated, and treatments that work in animals -- especially such a small number of animals -- routinely fail to work in human trials.

Standard "treatment" for EVD usually involves trying to keep patients hydrated and alive long enough to give the immune system a chance to battle the virus. And while that approach may sound unpromising, this outbreak has had a fatality rate of about 60 percent so far, not close to the 90 percent that's often reported. That 60 percent number could still rise, but survival cannot necessarily be attributed to an experimental treatment. While EVD is highly fatal, some people do survive without any extraordinary interventions.

ZMapp is not even far enough along to have entered the clinical trial phase, but it may have been chosen in this case instead of the promising experimental drug Tekmira, because an ongoing Tekmira trial was just halted by the FDA. That doesn't mean that all research on Tekmira is over, however. The ongoing trial was halted because healthy patients showed a problematic immune response.

But the FDA could still approve a new trial of the drug in sick patients, as the risk-benefit equation would be changed. A potential benefit of surviving a disease that kills 60-90 percent of patients could outweigh the risks of many potentially problematic side effects [It was not side effects that stopped the trial, but lack of an adequate immune response in all test humans. - Mod.JW]. CNN also reported that on 30 Jul 2014, the military approved additional funding for Mapp Biopharmaceutical because of their promising results so far.

If either ZMapp or Tekmira prove to be effective, testing, approving, and then producing a drug will still take time, even if the process is fast-tracked. At this point, the best hope for stopping this outbreak is not curing it but containing it. Even though the virus can only be transmitted by close contact, and thus it can be contained, health officials have been completely unable to do so in West Africa due to a combination of factors including poor healthcare infrastructure, distrust of authorities, traditional burial practices, and fear of healthcare providers.

At the present rate, World Health Organization chief Margaret Chan describes the consequences of not being able to stop the disease's spread as "catastrophic."

CDC issues highest-level alert for Ebola virus disease
-----------------------------
6 Aug 2014: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has issued its highest-level alert for a response to the EVD crisis in West Africa. "Ops Center moved to Level 1 response given the extension to Nigeria and potential to affect many lives," CDC chief Tom Frieden said Wed [6 Aug 2014] on Twitter. Level 1 means that increased staff and resources will be devoted to the outbreak, officials said. It is the 1st time the agency has invoked its highest level alert since 2009, over [the H1N1] flu outbreak.

NY City Patient In Isolation Does Not Have EVD
----------------------------------
6 Aug 2014: The man was placed into "strict isolation" within 7 minutes of his arrival and was undergoing various tests to determine the cause of the symptoms, the hospital said. "We would like to report that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have determined that the patient kept in isolation since Mon 4 Aug 2014 at The Mount Sinai Hospital has tested negative for Ebola virus disease (EVD)," the hospital said in a statement.

Singapore: additional precautions
----------------------------
7 Aug 2014: Despite the low risk of spread to Singapore, all hospitals, clinics and doctors have been alerted to stay vigilant against possible suspect cases. Our public hospitals also have in place appropriate infection control measures. Suspect cases are triaged at emergency departments and, as a precaution, isolated from other patients to minimise any risk of transmission. Measures are already in place to carry out contact tracing and to quarantine all close contacts if there is a case in Singapore.

Nigeria to Screen Outbound Travellers
--------------------------------
7 Aug 2014: As part of efforts to ensure that the spread of the deadly Ebola virus disease is contained, the Federal Government has announced that it would commence screening of all outbound travellers from Nigeria's shores. Travellers who show symptoms would be prevented from travelling, and, where they are non-Nigerians, they would only be allowed out if their countries have the capacity for a properly supervised evacuation and treatment, as was demonstrated by the USA recently.

[ProMED wishes to credit Kunihiko Iizuka and Mary Marshall for sending in several of the above reports.

The more we learn about the "serum" used to treat the 2 EVD-infected Americans, the less likely it seems that it is any good, but it is just about the only hope we have at this time, as the vaccine is a long way off.

Although the drug saved 4/4 monkeys when used within 24 hours of infection, it only saved 2/4 at 48 hours, and the Americans were treated days later than that. Then the doctor started recovering, probably too quickly to have been due to its effect, and the nurse so slowly that she needed a 2nd dose. So maybe their recovery is just due to excellent medical care and had nothing to do with the ZMapp serum. That leaves us with the Tekmira drug, which reportedly has not had a satisfactory immune response in clinical trials.

However, sooner or later, a dose is going to be given too late, or to a particularly vulnerable patient, who will die, and the death will be taken to show that the drug is useless, or worse, blamed on the drug itself, the way the anti-HIV drugs were blamed for producing AIDS in South Africa by the then President [not Mandela]. - Mod.JW]

[Hence the need for clinical trials of potential therapies. The ongoing occurrence of cases would allow for prospective, randomized, blinded trials of therapeutics that could definitively answer the question of their benefits (or harms).

ProMED adds its voice to the urgent calls for such trials to be conducted, ideally, under the auspices of international organizations. - Mod.LM
