----------------------------------------------------------------------
I believe that this will likely be a very interesting exercise to observe and learn from.

Reduction or removal of susceptible feral or wild animal populations for disease control purposes is never, ever, as simple as it appears on paper.

Wild boar are an intelligent, socially-responsive animal species that is likely to adapt rapidly (and probably quite variably) to reduction/removal pressures, so any culling activities will inevitably need to be applied very early in the regional disease epidemiology and then be very carefully managed and coordinated to ensure that the population reduction/removal pressures do not foster spread of disease as animals respond to the pressures via movement.

The season may also need to be a critical consideration -- availability of food supplies and seasonal conditions can have quite profound impacts upon the capacity of wild animals to move naturally and artificially in response to pressures being applied to them such as habitat modification or population reduction/removal.

These were certainly critical lessons learned a world away in Australia during its campaign to eradicate bovine tuberculosis [BTb] when dealing with feral Asiatic water buffalo in the far north -- another socially responsive animal species with certain adaptive intelligence, but perhaps not quite on the same level as wild boar/pigs in that regard. Perhaps also relevant that BTb in the prevailing context was a vastly less contact-contagious disease with no insect vector-borne aspects compared to [African swine fever] ASF in European continental wild boar.

An extremely challenging situation with ASF.

Re: "Lithuania said Monday [27 Jan 2014] it plans a mass cull of its wild boars due to an outbreak of African swine fever [ASF] ...
"The goal is to leave up to 10 percent of the current 60 000-strong (wild boar) population to prevent the virus from spreading," said Jurgita Savickaite, spokeswoman for the Food and Veterinary Service."

This strategy has practically no chance of success. To my awareness, no one, anywhere, has ever succeeded in even temporarily eradicating 90 percent of any sort of wild or feral pig population from a mainland habitat. Many US states have been attempting feral pig eradication for decades with no hint of success; the likelihood that Lithuania could succeed, with a fraction of the resources, in a habitat where boar are native and therefore well-adapted to the climate, is slim and none.

As ProMED-mail moderator AS pointed out on 17 Oct 2013 [ProMED-mail archive no 20131017.2007522], "The main drawback in dealing with this viral disease, worldwide, is the absence of a vaccine. Renewed/enhanced efforts to address this issue deserve priority."

A baited vaccine, bio-engineered to be air-dropped like Raboral, is really the only approach likely to have any success.

Next best would be to deploy a contraceptive product specific to pigs, such as the USDA-developed Gonacon.

Trying to hunt or poison wild or feral pigs just makes warier pigs. And, since pigs are cannibalistic, they are often their own most significant natural predator, so killing adult pigs (especially boars) may accomplish little more than ensuring that more piglets survive to maturity.

[3] DEFRA: outbreak assessment
Date: Mon 27 Jan 2014
Source: DEFRA (UK Department for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs) Veterinary & Science Policy Advice, International Disease Monitoring. Ref: VITT/1200 ASF in wild boar in Lithuania [edited]
http://www.defra.gov.uk/animal-diseases/files/poa-asf-lithuania-20140127.pdf


Preliminary outbreak assessment
-------------------------------
1. Disease report
The Lithuanian Authorities have reported to the European Commission and the OIE 2 cases of African swine fever [ASF] in wild boar in 2 separate counties in Alytus and Vilnius regions (OIE, 2014; see map at the source URL above). This is the 1st occurrence of ASF in the EU outside Sardinia, since the disease was first reported in 2007 in Georgia and then in Russia. Disease control measures are in place, which include management of the wild boar population, and movement controls in line with EU legislation. In addition the European Commission will put in place interim protective measures in a demarcated infected area, concerning the movements of all live pigs and POAO [products of animal origin].

2. Situation assessment
Recent reports in the media suggested there had been a rise in wild boar mortality in the Alytus region of Lithuania and therefore the Veterinary Authorities have been closely monitoring and testing all wild boar found dead or hunted. The current cases are a 12-month-old shot wild boar and a 3-year-old animal found dead.

Since June 2013, when Belarus first reported cases of ASF in wild boar (Defra, 2013), Lithuania and the other neighbouring EU Member States (Estonia, Latvia, and Poland) have put in place additional checks and safeguard measures for what was seen as an almost inevitable spread of disease in wild boar across the borders. Lithuania had been carrying out a high level of testing of wild boar since that time and these are the 1st reports of positive test results. In addition, all livestock transport vehicles must provide documentary evidence of cleansing and disinfection and additional disinfection is carried out at Border Inspection Posts of trucks, cars, and buses as well as people crossing the border on foot. Checks made of vehicles entering Lithuania across the border from Belarus for products of animal origin since June 2013 led to the seizure of over 3.3 tonnes and nearly 7.5 tonnes of category 1 animal by-products (State Food & Veterinary Service Lithuania, 2013). Other countries in the region are carrying out similar checks and controls. The concept of a wild boar fence along the border was discussed but deemed impractical. The EU has provided guidelines and additional funding to carry out surveillance and control of ASF in feral pigs. Part of that funding was to look at using repellents in some areas along the eastern border, to deter wild boar entering agricultural areas, but this may have been hampered during winter weather.

The recent report of a positive wild boar in Ukraine has not led to any further cases being found, although Russia has reported this month [January 2014] from 3 regions, Moscow (wild boar), Kaluga (domestic pigs), and Volgograd (domestic pigs) clearly indicating the disease is still present and circulating and therefore the border with the EU continues to come under threat (OIE, 2014a). Belarus has not reported any cases in wild boar, only in domestic pigs.

Lithuania is approved for the trade in live pigs and products of animal origin. According to TRACES [Trade Control and Expert System]`, the EU trade notification system, there have been no consignments of live pigs destined for the UK from Lithuania for at least 2 years. Products of animal origin are not recorded in TRACES, and although there have been recent imports of raw pet food, these were neither pork products nor destined for livestock animals. Lithuania and Denmark do trade regularly in live pigs, as was noted during the CSF outbreak in Lithuania in 2009 and therefore this regular movement of pigs and transport could increase the risk of spread to other member states including the UK.

3. Conclusions
It should be emphasised that this report concerns wild boar. There is no evidence of disease being reported in the commercial pig sector in Lithuania.

This is the 1st report of spread into the EU of ASF from neighbouring Eastern European countries, likely as a result of movement of infected animals from affected regions in Belarus. Wild boar are notoriously difficult to control and therefore it is important to maintain vigilance in terms of movement of livestock, transport, workers around and out of the region and entering commercial pig farms. The quantification of risk from illegal trade is difficult to measure and we therefore consider there is a constant low risk of introduction of various exotic animal diseases into an uninfected area through the illegal trade of infected meat or contaminated products/fomites; this list of diseases includes ASF. If disease were to be reported in domestic pigs in the EU, we would consider the likelihood of ASF being introduced to the UK pig population to increase to low but if it were to happen the key to control would be early detection, therefore we take this opportunity to remind farmers of the requirement to report any clinical signs of disease suspicion.

This incursion in wild boar would not necessarily raise the risk of introduction of disease to the UK; efforts to control the disease in line with contingency plans before it becomes established give reassurance of the system of legal trade and animal health certification within the EU.

We will continue to monitor the situation and report on technical and political developments as part of exchanging information with other countries and sectors.

Yesterday [Tue 28 Jan 2014], in reaction to the outbreak of African swine fever [ASF] in Lithuania, the Food and Veterinary Service has ordered several import bans, Food and Veterinary Service spokeswoman Anna Joffe informed the business information portal Nozare.lv, cites LETA [Latvian news agency].

Animal feed produced in Lithuania's southeastern regions have been banned, as well as reproductive materials from live pigs, including pig embryos, egg cells, and sperm.

At the same time, there will be tighter control of animal products, especially pork products, on Latvian borders. Vehicles transporting animals will be subject to disinfection.

The Food and Veterinary Service also asks hunters to be especially careful, and report and suspicious wild boar activities.

As reported, the government today agreed in principle to allocate EUR 1.36 million [USD 1.86 million] for ASF prevention measures, as controls will be tightened on borders in an attempt to keep the disease out of Latvian territory.

According to the Agriculture Ministry, it is necessary to tighten controls on Latvia's borders, as there have been recent confirmations of ASF in Lithuania's border area with Belarus.

The AFP news agency reports that Lithuania said Monday [27 Jan 2014] it plans a mass cull of its wild boars due to an outbreak of African swine fever after neighbors banned pork import from the country [for an update of said decision, see item 5 below].

Non-EU neighbors Russia and Belarus banned pork products from Lithuania that are not processed thermally after the virus was detected in the country last week [week of 20 Jan 2014], she told AFP.

Lithuania's government is expected on Wednesday 29 Jan 2014] to officially declare a state of emergency in regions bordering Belarus, which it claims was the source of the virus.

All wild boars hunted in these regions -- all close to EU neighbor Poland -- will be incinerated if tests show they carry the virus, which is harmless to humans but lethal to pigs and has no known cure.

Lithuania also imposed a temporary ban on the shipping of live pigs out of the affected areas, fearing the virus could spread to local farms.

[5] Lithuania: updated governmental measures
Date: Wed 29 Jan 2014

http://www.pigprogress.net/Health-Diseases/Outbreaks/2014/1/Lithuania-is-struggling-with-ASF-1453329W/


Lithuania intends to reduce the population of wild boars in the country from the current 60 000 to only 6000 in a bid to stop the spread of African swine fever (ASF), said the Interior Minister, Daylis Alfonsas Barakauskas, after a meeting with the government [see responses in items 1 and 2 above].

"Such a decision can be considered as a preventive measure aimed to avoid damage from ASF virus that could be huge. Its main carriers are wild boars, and there is no vaccine against ASF," said the report.

Barakauskas also said he plans to requests funds from the European Commission for the construction of a fence on the border with Belarus, which will be intended to prevent the migration of wild boars.

According to the head of the Lithuanian Veterinary and Food Service, Jonas Milius, the amount of funds requested for the construction of a fence is 15 million Lithuanian litas (EUR 4.3 million/USD 5.87 million). He also added that about 800 000 litas (EUR 250 000/USD 341 000) will be needed for the purchasing of mobile equipment for incineration of carcasses of wild boars.

"We hope that we will quickly eliminate the outbreak, and the movement of wild boars will not be very large, they usually settle in the winter," said Milius. Meanwhile, Ukraine announced that it stopped all pork imports from Lithuania, including pork products.

[Exactly one year ago, on 30 Jan 2013, Lithuania's State Food and Veterinary Service (SFVS) performed a table-top simulation exercise on African swine fever in Vilnius. The exercise included theoretical and practical training of the personnel of SFVS with the aim of applying emergency measures in compliance with the contingency plans for the disease. It may be assumed -- but confirmation will be helpful -- that mass culling of wild boars was included among the considered contingency plans.
