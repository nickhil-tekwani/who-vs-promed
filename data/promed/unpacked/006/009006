The USGS National Wildlife Health Center is receiving reports of sick or dead double-crested cormorants (_Phalacrocorax auritus_), predominantly juveniles, from the Great Lakes region. Common clinical signs observed are increased fledgling mortality at rookeries, neck weakness, unilateral wing paralysis, incoordination, and tremors. Occasionally, concurrent mortality in other species including gulls and pelicans is reported. We are currently investigating events from multiple locations in central and southern Minnesota and Wisconsin.

Virulent Newcastle Disease virus (vNDV) has been confirmed by genetic sequencing in cormorants submitted from Mille Lacs County, Minnesota. Cormorants from Blue Earth, Rice, and Big Stone Counties in Minnesota and Dodge County in Wisconsin have also screened positive for avian paramyxovirus-1 (APMV-1) and further characterization of the virus is on-going to determine if it is vNDV. None of the dead gulls or pelicans collected in association with cormorant mortality have been positive for APMV-1. Our experience with previous vNDV outbreaks has shown that sympatric species are rarely affected by vNDV, and cause-of-death determination for the other species (e.g., gulls and pelicans) is on-going. All birds have screened negative for highly pathogenic avian influenza virus.

Wildlife and Domestic Animal Significance
-------------------------------------------
Certain strains of APMV-1 can cause significant wild bird mortality, but these events are typically limited to juvenile double-crested cormorants. Some strains of APMV-1 classified as vNDV, including some strains isolated from cormorants, can also cause significant disease even in vaccinated poultry and are reportable to state and federal agricultural officials.

Human Health Considerations
----------------------------
APMV-1 can cause mild self-limiting conjunctivitis in humans, therefore the use of eye protection or face shields should be considered when investigating these events. As a routine precaution when handling any sick or dead birds, personal protective equipment including gloves, rubber boots, and disposable or cloth coveralls should be worn and hands should be thoroughly washed afterwards.

Disease Control and Biosecurity
-------------------------------
Because of the potential for some strains of vNDV to cause mortality in domestic poultry, it is important to practice good biosecurity when investigating any mortality event involving double-crested cormorants. Wear boots, gloves, and outer clothing that can be cleaned and disinfected, bagged and washed, or bagged and discarded. Carcasses collected from these sites should be disposed of on-site (by burying or incineration) rather than transported to other locations for disposal. Equipment, including transportation vehicles, used at a morbidity or mortality site should be washed to remove organic material and mud, then disinfected with 10 percent household bleach solution (9 parts water: 1 part bleach) or other suitable disinfectant, such as Virkon, as soon as possible after use. Limit visits to the affected site until young have fledged and moved off the colony. As a precaution, limiting contact with pet birds and poultry for 5 days is advised for any personnel that have recently visited an affected site or handled contaminated animals or materials.

[The double-crested cormorant (_Phalacrocorax auritus_) is a member of the cormorant family of seabirds. It occurs along inland waterways as well as in coastal areas, and is widely distributed across North America, from the Aleutian Islands in Alaska down to Florida and Mexico. For a picture, go to https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/PHOTO/LARGE/5592053606_273a705e67_o.jpg.

Virtually all birds are considered susceptible to infection with Newcastle diseases virus (NDV; Fam. _Paramyxoviridae_). It is well established that wild birds, such as cormorants, carry virulent avian paramyxovirus serotype 1 (APMV-1; causative agent of Newcastle disease).

Double-crested Cormorants play an important role in the maintenance and circulation of APMV-1 in the wild. Previous surveys of _P. auritus_ populations in the Great Lakes region showed that the prevalence of antibodies to APMV-1 in after-hatch year birds was consistently high, ranging from 86.3 to 91.6 percent (Ref: Cross TA, Arsnoe DM, Minnis RB, King DT, Swafford S, Pedersen K and Owen JC: Prevalence of avian paramyxovirus 1 and avian influenza virus in double-crested Cormorants (_Phalacrocorax auritus_) in eastern North America. J Wildl Dis. 2013; 49(4):965-977. doi: 10.7589/2012-06-164. Abstract available at http://www.bioone.org/doi/pdf/10.7589/2012-06-164). - Mod.PMB]
