4th case reported of EEE in a Virginia horse this year [2016]
-------------------------------------------------------------
A viral disease, eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) affects the central nervous system and is transmitted to horses by infected mosquitoes. On 5 Aug 2016, the Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services announced on its Facebook page the state's 4th case of eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) in a horse this year.

The horse, a 6 year old Tennessee walking horse mare, was from Hopewell. The horse had not been vaccinated since 2014 and was euthanized because of the severity of her signs.

Eastern equine encephalitis is a mosquitoborne viral disease that primarily affects horses. The disease, also called "sleeping sickness", causes inflammation or swelling of the brain and spinal cord. Clinical signs include impaired vision, aimless wandering, head pressing, circling, inability to swallow, irregular staggering gait, paralysis, convulsions, and death. Once a horse has been bitten by an infected mosquito, it may take 3 to 10 days for signs of the disease to appear.

[State of Louisiana] agricultural commissioner Mike Strain DVM, is warning owners to vaccinate their horses. So far in 2016, 5 horses have died as a result of eastern equine encephalitis (EEE). "While the horses may have been vaccinated in the past, none seem to be up to date on their vaccinations," said Strain.

Four of the horses were located in Tangipahoa Parish. The 5th horse was in Washington Parish. While there are no reports of West Nile virus (WNV) in horses at this time, that is also a threat.

"Horse owners need to be mindful of both eastern equine encephalitis and West Nile. The rain we have, especially at this time of year, is a breeding ground for mosquitoes. If a mosquito bites an infected bird, eastern equine encephalitis or West Nile virus can be spread to horses, dogs, cats and humans."

The mosquito-transmitted diseases can cause inflammation or swelling of the brain and spinal cord. Infected horses may show lethargy, weakness, paralysis, neurological signs and death. Prevention includes avoiding mosquitoes, using mosquito repellants that are safe for horses and humans, and vaccination for horses.

So far, there is no vaccination approved for people. Horse owners should contact their local veterinarian regarding proper vaccination protocols during this time of increased risk.

A horse in West Tennessee has tested positive for eastern equine encephalitis (EEE), a virus that can be fatal for horses and humans. The Tennessee Departments of Agriculture and Health (TDAH) are advising citizens to take precautions to protect themselves and their livestock.

Mosquitoes transmit EEE. Humans cannot contract these viral infections directly from infected horses. However, mosquitoborne diseases do pose a public health risk. "Although Tennessee has never had a documented human case of EEE, it is important for the public to remember mosquitoborne diseases including EEE and West Nile virus (WNV) can occur each summer," medical entomologist Dr Abelardo Moncayo said. "Fortunately, the prevention measures are similar for EEE and other mosquitoborne diseases."

EEE kills up to 90 per cent of the horses infected. The horse in Madison County did not survive. Although there is no vaccine for humans, the EEE vaccine for horses is particularly effective to protect horses against the virus. "Horse owners should vaccinate their livestock annually and always watch for signs of illness," state veterinarian Dr Charles Hatcher said. "If your horse is lethargic, loses eyesight or is unable to swallow, contact your veterinarian immediately."

Standing water provides an ideal location for mosquitos to breed. Mosquito control should include "tip and toss" and "drain and cover" to eliminate standing water around the barn and home, and use of mosquito "dunks" to eliminate larvae in water troughs and ponds. TDH recommends the following to protect people from mosquito bites:

- Apply repellents to skin often. These can include lotions, liquids or sprays. TDAH and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommend the use of repellents which contain DEET, Picaridin, oil of lemon eucalyptus or para-menthane 3, 8-diol and IR3535. Duration of protection varies by repellent. Read labels on products to determine when reapplications are necessary for optimal protection. To learn more about insect repellents, visit http://cfpub.epa.gov/oppref/insect/.

- Wear long, loose and light-colored shirts and pants and wear socks. Tucking shirts in pants and tucking pants into socks will help form a barrier. Wear closed shoes or boots instead of sandals.

- Treat clothing with permethrin or purchase clothing pretreated with permethrin.

- In remote locations lacking window screens and/or air conditioning, the use of bed nets is advised. These should reach the floor or be tucked under the mattress.

- Avoid perfumes, colognes and products with fragrances that might attract mosquitoes.

"We encourage Tennesseans to use preventive measures to avoid mosquitoborne diseases," Tennessee Department of Health deputy state epidemiologist John Dunn DVM, PhD said. "With ongoing threats like EEE and WNV, and new diseases like Zika virus, it's important to protect yourself and your family."

The state veterinarian is responsible for monitoring for and preventing the spread of animal disease, as well as promoting animal health in Tennessee. The office works with private veterinarians, animal pathologists and disease diagnostic laboratories to identify diseases and determine the cause of animal deaths.

[The most effective EEE prevention is vaccination. The vaccine is usually combined with vaccines for West Nile virus (WNV) and western equine encephalitis (WEE). Most owners usually vaccinate in the spring, but immunity to EEE is the shortest and wanes within about 3-4 months. Owners are encouraged to vaccinate every 3 to 4 months to protect against EEE.

"In the United States, equine vaccines are available for eastern equine encephalomyelitis (or eastern equine encephalitis, EEE), western equine encephalomyelitis (WEE), Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis (VEE), and West Nile virus encephalomyelitis.

"The distribution of EEE has historically been restricted to the eastern, south eastern, and some southern states (but disease incidence is also reported in the upper midwestern states of Ohio, Michigan, and Wisconsin). Outbreaks of WEE have been recorded in the western and midwestern states. Variants of WEE have caused sporadic cases in the north east and south east, most notably Florida. VEE occurs in South and Central America but has not been diagnosed in the United States for more than 35 years. The availability of licensed vaccine products combined with an inability to completely eliminate risk of exposure justifies immunization against EEE and WEE as core prophylaxis for all horses residing in or traveling to North America and any other geographic areas where EEE and/or WEE is endemic.

"Transmission of EEE/WEE/VEE is by mosquitoes, and infrequently by other bloodsucking insects, to horses from wild birds or rodents, which serve as natural reservoirs for these viruses. Human beings are also susceptible to these diseases when the virus is transmitted to them by infected mosquitoes; however, horse-to-horse, or horse-to-human transmission by mosquitoes is highly unlikely, because the amount of virus in the blood of horses affected by EEE or WEE is small. The viremia that occurs with VEE is higher, and direct horse-to-horse or horse-to-human transmission is possible. Of these 3 encephalitides, WEE has the lowest mortality (about 50 per cent). Eastern equine encephalomyelitis is the most virulent for horses, with mortality approaching 90 per cent. Epidemiological evidence indicates that young horses are particularly susceptible to disease caused by EEE. Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis can also be lethal; however, some horses develop subclinical infections which result in lasting immunity.

"The risk of exposure and geographic distribution of EEE and WEE vary from year to year with changes in distribution of insect vectors and reservoirs important in the natural ecology of the virus. EEE activity in mosquitoes and birds, and resultant disease in humans and equids, continues to cause concern along the east coast and demonstrates northward encroachment. WEE has caused minimal disease in horses in the last 2 decades; however, the virus continues to be detected in mosquitoes and birds throughout the western states. In addition, variants that cause clinical disease in equids have been detected in the eastern US.

"VEE is a reportable foreign animal disease. Epidemics of VEE occur when the virus undergoes genetic change and develops greater virulence in avian and mammalian hosts. These viral variants are able to multiply to high levels in the horse, and then the horse becomes a reservoir in these outbreaks. Areas of southern Texas, California, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and the west coast of Florida are likely at the most risk for natural VEE encroachment from Central and South America.

"Vaccination against VEE is controversial because:
1. Vaccination against a foreign animal disease may confound testing in the event of an outbreak. However, vaccination against EEE/WEE will also cause cross-reaction in VEE antibody testing.
2. Experimental and field data have demonstrated that previous infection with either EEE or WEE may provide cross-protection against VEE. It is therefore possible that EEE/WEE bivalent vaccination may provide partial cross-protection, although it is likely to be less than that following infection.
3. A conditionally available modified live (MLV) vaccine has been released during previous outbreaks. Should an outbreak occur, it is likely that this highly attenuated MLV would be released, and this MLV provides superior protection against transmissible viremia.

"In summary, horses that receive annual EEE/WEE vaccines may be partially protected against VEE infection. In the event of an outbreak, the availability of and vaccination with the highly effective MLV product would induce rapid, complete immunity while allowing for accurate surveillance before VEE specific vaccination. Killed VEE vaccine should be used only in high-risk areas of the US, at the discretion of the attending veterinarian, or when necessary, with input from state agriculture officials. The inactivated VEE vaccine is less effective that the MLV VEE vaccine, and will blunt responses to the MLV VEE vaccine.

Vaccines
--------
"EEE/WEE vaccines currently available are formalin-inactivated adjuvanted whole-virus products. Early testing of bivalent (EEE/WEE) vaccines was performed by intracranial challenge with either EEE and WEE; the formalin-inactivated preparations were shown to be highly efficacious protecting against clinical disease. Currently, the only available VEE vaccines are killed products; an MLV would be conditionally released in the face of an outbreak.

Vaccination schedules EEE/WEE
-----------------------------
"Adult horses previously vaccinated against EEE/WEE: annual revaccination must be completed prior to vector season in the spring. In animals at high risk or with limited immunity, more frequent vaccination or appropriately timed vaccination is recommended in order to induce protective immunity during periods of likely exposure. In areas where mosquitoes are active year-round, many veterinarians elect to vaccinate horses at 6 month intervals to ensure uniform protection throughout the year, although this practice is not specifically recommended by manufacturers of vaccines.

"Adult horses, previously unvaccinated against EEE/WEE or of unknown vaccinal history: administer a primary series of 2 doses with a 4- to 6-week interval between doses. Revaccinate prior to the onset of the next vector season and annually thereafter.

"Pregnant mares, previously vaccinated against EEE/WEE: vaccinate 4 to 6 weeks before foaling.

"Pregnant mares, unvaccinated or having unknown vaccinal history: immediately begin a 2-dose primary series with a 4-week interval between doses. Booster at 4 to 6 weeks before foaling or prior to the onset of the next vector season -- whichever occurs 1st.

"Foals of mares vaccinated against EEE/WEE in the pre-partum period: administer a primary 3-dose series beginning at 4 to 6 months of age. A 4- to 6-week interval between the 1st and 2nd doses is recommended. The 3rd dose should be administered at 10 to 12 months of age, prior to the onset of the next mosquito season.

"In the south eastern US, due to earlier seasonal disease risk, vaccination may be started at 2 to 3 months of age. When initiating vaccinations in younger foals, a series of 4 primary doses should be administered, with a 4 week interval between the 1st and 2nd doses and a 4-week interval between the 2nd and 3rd doses. The 4th dose should be administered at 10 to 12 months of age, prior to the onset of the next mosquito season.

"Foals of unvaccinated mares or having unknown vaccinal history: administer a primary series of 3 doses with a 30 day interval between the 1st and 2nd doses and a 60 day [8 week] interval between the 2nd and 3rd doses. The primary series of vaccinations should be initiated at 3 to 4 months of age and, where possible, be completed prior to the onset of the high-risk insect vector season. If the primary series is initiated during the mosquito vector season, an interval of 3 to 4 weeks between the 2nd and 3rd doses is preferable to the interval of 8 weeks described above.

"Horses having been naturally infected and recovered: recovered horses likely develop lifelong immunity. Consider revaccination only if the immune status of the animal changes the risk for susceptibility to infection. Examples of these conditions would include the long-term use of corticosteroids and pituitary adenoma."
