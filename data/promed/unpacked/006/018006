The Department of Health (DOH) in Western Visayas recorded 5 deaths
due to rabies for the period January to August 2011. Dr Joji Jimenez,
regional rabies medical coordinator of DOH 6 [Region VI] said during
the PIA-Cable Television program that 5 cases were recorded in the
region: 2 were in Iloilo, 2 in Capiz, and 1 in Aklan.

Dr Jimenez noted that: "For the past 2 years, Region 6 was no longer
included in the country's top 10 regions with rabies cases, unlike in
the year 2006 where we were listed number one in the entire country in
terms of deaths due to rabies." Jimenez said there had been a
significant drop of rabies cases in 2009 when the region had only 14
deaths, but in 2010 it increased to 15 cases. The January to August
2011 record showed only 5 rabies cases. The rabies case in Aklan was
recorded in Banga, Aklan. In Capiz, the 2 fatalities were from
Jamindan and Panit-an; and for Iloilo province the rabies cases were
recorded from Quiling, Lambunao and Botong, Badiangan.

As [regards] animal bite cases in Western Visayas, the DOH records
show that in year 2009 some 24 631 animal bites were reported; 30 495
animal bites in 2010; and for the 1st quarter of 2011 -- the record
shows 7057 bite cases. The DOH and the Department of Agriculture did
[not] comment , but reiterated the government's campaign on the
prevention and control of rabies through immunization of dogs.

The technical working group (TWG) on rabies prevention and control in
Western Visayas is led by the Department of Agriculture and the
Department of Health with members coming from the Department of the
Interior and Local Government, Department of Education, Philippine
National Police, Philippine Information Agency, and the private
organizations, among others.

The TWG as one of its activities on the campaign against rabies, has
conducted an orientation on rabies prevention program for teachers in
Western Visayas. The activity was attended by school superintendents,
principals, and school heads from the various schools' divisions in
the region. Dr Jimenez said that the activity hopes to integrate the
rabies module in the elementary school curriculum so that the children
will be engaged in the war against rabies, and would contribute
significantly to the program's sustainability. "There will still be a
lot of fine tuning before we achieve getting the anti-rabies program
into the schools' curriculum, but we hope that sooner the concerned
sector will address this issue so that the pupils who are always the
victims will have a year-round reminder about the threats posed by
rabies to human health," Jimenez said and added that "continuous
education on methods for preventing rabies will play a more important
role in eradicating the disease because it involves communities at all
age levels, and the teachers really are in constant contact with the
children in elementary schools to teach them about rabies," Jimenez
said.

The rabies regional medical coordinator also reminded the public that
on 28 Sep 2011, the region will celebrate World Rabies Day. Dog
immunization and castration among others will be conducted on said
date in designated places, Dr Jimenez said.

[Western Visayas, one of the regions of the Philippines, is designated
as Region VI. It consists of 6 provinces; Aklan, Antique, Negros
Occidental, Capiz, Guimaras, and Iloilo and 16 cities making it the
region with the highest number of cities. Iloilo City is the regional
center. The location and provinces of Western Visayas can be seen on

Since children apparently are the most frequent victims of rabies
virus infection in Western Visayas, the priority being given to
inclusion of rabies education in the school curriculum should reduce
the overall human death rate. Progress in control of rabies in Western
Visayas has been impressive. However, final eradication of rabies
virus infection will require a more intensive and extensive dog
control programme. - Mod.CP]
