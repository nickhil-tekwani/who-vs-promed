ROME - Rift Valley Fever is threatening livestock and people in Iraq, the
UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) said in a statement issued
today. "The disease is usually found in Africa, but it has recently been
diagnosed in the Middle East," said Roger Paskin, FAO Animal Health
Officer. "Yemen and Saudi Arabia are currently infected, and there is a
real danger that the virus could spread into Iraq. There is a need to
monitor the situation very closely in order to control a possible outbreak."
Rift Valley Fever is a highly contagious disease spread mainly by
mosquitoes and the movement of animals, causing abortion and mortality in
sheep, goat, cattle, buffaloes, and camels. In humans, it can cause
flu-like symptoms, which can sometimes lead to death. All the animals at
the western borders of Iraq with Saudi Arabia are at risk, FAO said. That
is slightly more than 4 million sheep and goats in addition to about 200
000 cattle, FAO said as it started an emergency project in the country.
As a precautionary measure, the Government has sent 4 teams of
veterinarians to the Saudi Arabian border zone. FAO will assist the
government and will send a laboratory specialist as well as materials for
blood sample collection and laboratory analysis. The Iraqi Veterinary
Services currently lack the necessary laboratory supplies to carry out
effective monitoring and diagnosis, according to FAO.
"By the end of the 6-month project, we expect the collection of around 14
000 blood samples from animals that give us a clear idea if the Rift Valley
Fever virus has spread to Iraq or not. We strongly urge other countries in
the region to take similar precautionary measures".
Rift Valley Fever was first identified in the Rift Valley of Kenya in the
early 1930s.

[RVF was reported to OIE by Saudi Arabia on 6 Oct 2000 and by Yemen on 10
Nov 2000; neither has provided updates. See postings above for the progress
of the disease in both countries since last year. There is probably more to
this report than meets the eye. We look forward to what emerges in Iraq and
its neighbours. - Mod.MHJ
