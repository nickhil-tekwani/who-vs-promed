Regarding earlier announcement that some patients in a male
psychiatric ward of Tai Po Hospital (TPH) have presented with
symptoms of skin abscess and whose test results have been confirmed
positive to _Streptococcus pyogenes_ [also called group A
streptococcus], the spokesperson of the hospital gave the following
update today (22 Dec 2008):

Test results of 3 more patients from the ward concerned have been
confirmed positive for _Streptococcus pyogenes_. In addition, test
result of a patient (aged 74 ) in another male psychiatric ward has
also been confirmed positive for the bacteria. Up to now, the test
results of 15 patients (aged from 20-76) in total in the psychiatric
unit have been confirmed positive for the bacteria.

All patients are now being treated under isolation and in stable
condition. Admission and visiting to the wards concerned will
continue to be suspended. Infection control measures have been
stepped up and all patients are under close surveillance.

The TPH Infection Control Team has reported the case to the Hospital
Authority and the Centre for Health Protection.

[Group A streptococci (GAS) are an uncommon but important cause of
nosocomial infections. GAS can be highly contagious; skin lesions,
poor personal hygiene and crowding would be expected to facilitate
its spread from person to person. Prior ProMED-mail posts -- archive
numbers 20080206.0484 and 20050308.0692 -- have reported spread of
group A streptococcal disease in health care settings among
susceptible patients and health care workers.

The above news release does not state whether the cases had any
underlying diseases, such as open wounds, recent surgery, diabetes,
or immune deficiency, which would make patients particularly
vulnerable to GAS infection.

Molecular analysis (such as pulsed-field typing) of the isolates
will aid documenting a common source outbreak. The source of a
nosocomial outbreak may be an asymptomatic patient or even a health
care worker who carries GAS either in the anus, vagina, skin, or
pharynx and can shed the organism into the immediate environment
despite proper gowning and gloving (see
<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00056612.htm>).

M protein is the major somatic virulence factor of GAS, which have
been divided into serotypes based on the antigenic differences in the
M protein molecule. More recently GAS are typed on the basis of
sequence analysis of the portion of the emm gene that encodes M
serospecificity
(<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/biotech/strep/M-ProteinGene_typing.htm>).
