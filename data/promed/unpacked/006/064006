A case of a rare virus transmitted by ticks has been detected in Cayuga county for the 1st time, the furthest west the virus has been found in the state, according to health officials [Mon 1 Oct 2018].

The Cayuga County Health Department announced that the Powassan virus, spread by the bite of the blacklegged tick, has been confirmed in an adult patient.

Unlike other tick-borne disease such as Lyme disease, the Powassan virus can be transmitted from the bite of a tick after being attached for as little as 15 minutes, according to a department press release.

Infected individuals often do not develop symptoms, but those who do typically do so within 1-4 weeks after being bit. Symptoms can include fever, headache, vomiting, weakness, confusion, loss of coordination, speech difficulties and seizures.

More severe cases can result in headache, high fever, confusion, tremors, seizures, paralysis, coma, or death. The virus can also cause encephalitis and meningitis, inflammation of the brain or the brain and spinal cord's membrane, respectively.

The health department recommends consulting a healthcare provider if you exhibit any such symptoms.

The resident diagnosed with Powassan virus in the county is exhibiting symptoms, according to department staff. According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the Powassan virus is not transmittable between humans.

To reduce the likelihood of contracting any tick-borne illnesses while outdoors, the health department recommends wearing light-colored clothing, tucking pants into socks and shirts into pants, checking frequently for ticks on skin or clothing, brushing off any ticks found on clothing before attachment and making a thorough check of your body for ticks once inside.

Insect repellent can also assist in reducing tick bites. Repellent should not be applied directly to the face or on children, according to the department. Instead, apply it to the hands first before applying it to children.

For more information call the county health department at 315-253-1560.

[Cases of Powassan virus (POWV) infection have occurred in various counties in New York state. Now, Cayuga county has been added to the list. Although the report above indicates that the infected individual is exhibiting symptoms, it does not indicate which symptoms have developed and if encephalitis is among them. Powassan virus is endemic in New York State, and cases occur there sporadically. The tick vector is the blacklegged tick, _Ixodes scapularis_. Humans become infected with POWV during spillover transmission from the natural transmission cycles. In humans, POWV can be a causative agent of a severe neuroinvasive illness, with 50% of survivors displaying long-term neurological sequelae.

POWV was recognized as a human pathogen in 1958, when a young boy died of severe encephalitis in Powassan, Ontario, Canada. In this case, POWV was isolated from the brain autopsy. There are 2 distinct genetic lineages now recognized: POWV (lineage I) and blacklegged tick virus (lineage II). Since the index case in 1958, over 100 human cases of POWV have been reported, with an apparent rise in disease incidence in the past 16 years. This recent increase in cases may represent a true emergence of POWV in regions where the tick vector species are prevalent, or it could represent an increase in POWV surveillance and diagnosis. - Mod.TY
