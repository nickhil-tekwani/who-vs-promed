Fatal anthrax case in Germany same strain as Scottish cases
------------------------------------------------------------
Tests carried out at the Health Protection Agency (HPA) and Germany's
Robert Koch Institute (RKI) and Friedrich-Loeffler Institute (FLI) on
the strain of anthrax isolated from a heroin user who died in Germany
in mid December [2009] have shown it is indistinguishable from strains
isolated from anthrax cases in Scotland. This suggests that the
anthrax contamination in both countries, thought to originate in the
heroin supply, could share a common source. This could suggest that
the contamination of the heroin may have occurred prior to
distribution of the heroin in Scotland and Germany, however it does
not offer definitive proof.

Of 18 confirmed anthrax isolates from Scottish cases by the HPA's
Special Pathogens Reference Laboratory at Porton Down, 14 have so far
been confirmed as being of the same strain, with further isolates
awaiting confirmation. Typing on the isolate from the German patient
has now confirmed it is also of the same strain. These results suggest
that the outbreak may be associated with anthrax contamination from a
single source.

To date in Scotland there have been a total of 19 confirmed cases in
Scotland, of whom a total of 9 individuals have died. A further case
of anthrax in a patient living in London with a history of heroin use
has also been confirmed by the Health Protection Agency (HPA). This
individual developed symptoms at the end of January 2010.
Investigations are continuing but no obvious connections to Scotland
have been identified.

Evidence suggests that contaminated heroin may still be in
circulation, and drug users all across Scotland must remain vigilant.
The outbreak began with the identification of cases in NHS Greater
Glasgow & Clyde in December [2009], with cases now having been
identified in 6 NHS board areas across the country, and represents the
1st known outbreak of anthrax to have occurred in conjunction with
drug use.

Dr Colin Ramsay, consultant epidemiologist at Health Protection
Scotland and head of the national Outbreak Control Team, said: "Drug
users are advised to cease taking heroin by any route if at all
possible. While we appreciate that this may be extremely difficult
advice to follow, it remains the only public health protection advice
possible based on current evidence. Users are encouraged to find out
more about support services in their area by calling Know the Score on
0800 587 5879 or visiting <http://www.scottishdrugservices.com>. Those
who do continue to use heroin should follow current harm reduction
advice, which says that fresh filters should be used on each occasion
and that filters should not be re-used. It must be noted however that
filters will not make heroin safe or remove all traces of anthrax
contamination, so the best advice remains not to use heroin by any
method. Users should seek urgent medical attention in the event of
symptoms such as redness or swelling at or near an injection site or
other symptoms of general illness such a high temperature, chills or a
severe headache, as early antibiotic treatment can be lifesaving."

Details of the case breakdown by NHS board are as follows:
Confirmed cases by NHS board area (total: 19)
- NHS Ayrshire and Arran: 1
- NHS Fife: 1
- NHS Forth Valley: 1
- NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde: 10
- NHS Lanarkshire: 3
- NHS Tayside: 3
Deaths by: NHS board area (total: 9)
- NHS Forth Valley: 1
- NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde: 6
- NHS Tayside: 2

[This confirms the suspicion existing for some time on the source for
the 2 strains being the same. Clearly the German case in Aachen scored
himself some heroin with or without the shipper knowing. Hopefully it
was just for him and not sufficient to be shared with others. In that
a month has passed without new German cases it would be logical to
think that the German case will be singular. - Mod.MHJ]

Anthrax alert for heroin users in London
----------------------------------------
The Health Protection Agency (HPA) and NHS (National Health Service)
London can confirm that a drug injecting heroin user has tested
positive for anthrax and is being treated in a London hospital.

This is the 1st case of anthrax seen in an injecting drug user in
England since similar cases were first seen in Scotland in December
2009. 19 cases have so far been confirmed in Scotland. Similarities to
the cases in Scotland suggest that the heroin, or a contaminated
cutting agent mixed with the heroin, is the likely source of infection.

Dr Brian McCloskey, director of the Health Protection Agency in
London, said: "We are working closely with NHS London to monitor the
situation. There is no evidence of person-to-person transmission in
this case and I'd like to reassure people that the risk to the general
population, including close family members of the infected patient, is
negligible. It is extremely rare for anthrax to be spread from person
to person and there has been no evidence of a significant risk of
airborne transmission associated with the current situation in Scotland.

"While public health investigations are ongoing, it must be assumed
that all heroin in London carries the risk of anthrax contamination.
Heroin users are advised to cease taking heroin by any route, if at
all possible, and to seek help from their local drug treatment
services. Heroin users in London are strongly encouraged, as soon as
possible, to find out more about the support services in their area.
They can be put in touch with local drug services and receive advice
by contacting Talk to Frank."

Professor Lindsey Davies, regional director of public health from NHS
London, said: "I urge all heroin users in London to be extremely alert
to the risks and to seek urgent medical advice if they experience
signs of infection such as redness or excessive swelling at or near an
injection site, or other symptoms of general illness such a high
temperature, chills, or a severe headache or breathing difficulties,
as early antibiotic treatment can be lifesaving. This is a very
serious infection for drug users and prompt treatment is crucial.

"Drug injecting is an extremely risky and dangerous practice and users
are vulnerable to a wide range of infectious diseases, both from the
action of piercing the skin, as well as contaminants in the drugs that
they use.

"Health professionals and drug action teams in England had already
been alerted to the situation in Scotland in December [2009] and we
will continue to work closely with colleagues who work with drug users
to monitor probable cases and raise awareness of the risks."

[We have already seen that Scottish heroin was being dumped. I gather
from contacts that there had been addict dissatisfaction with the
quality of the high being not "good". To keep their clients the
pushers would be pulling back that lot, and replacing it with a better
one in order to keep their clients. Then the inferior batch would be
remixed and/or shipped south, possibly at a bargain rate. This London
case indicates that the contaminated Scottish heroin is now in London.
Genomic confirmation of this London case is awaited. - Mod.MHJ]

Re: Afghan heroin in Russia
---------------------------
In a previous posting (see archive no. 20100203.0368) we reported that
the heroin in the UK comes from Afghanistan via the Balkans where it
is processed and repackaged, before being shipped by road to a Channel
port. The identical genomic identity of the German case in Aachen to
the Scottish cases indicates that in this case they were using the
port of Antwerp.

Russia is severely afflicted with heroin, which the government hints
follows from the Western intervention in Afghanistan. Unfortunately
the Russian drug policy is counterproductive. Any addict who seeks
medical help for his or her addiction is immediately put on the state
"narcological register". This information is available to police, who
can have the drug user arrested and put in prison, and causes huge
problems for people if they kick their habit and want to reintegrate
into society.

But to date there are no reports of heroin related human anthrax in
Russia, which would reinforce the hypothesis that the anthrax
contamination problem is in the Balkans. The usual contamination
problems associated with heroin, however, are occurring.

There are a number of reports worth reading on the Russian heroin problem:
