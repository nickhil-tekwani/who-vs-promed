Ron Gold did not indicate, in his comments on this topic, why he would
expect to seek replacement [of strain prevalence in the face mass
vaccination campaigns - Mod.ES. Has there been displacement of other
serogroups
following an epidemic? Are there data that suggest a group antigen slowly
increases immunity to all _N. meningitidis_ strains?

Replacement might occur following mass vaccination if the vaccine had a
significant effect on reducing acquisition of the carrier state, thereby
reducing transmission. For example, The conjugate meningococcal and
pneumococcal vaccines clearly reduce the prevalence of vaccine strains
among vaccinated children. However, we do not know enough about the
ecology of upper airway bacteria to know if such reductions will be
followed by replacement of other serogroups of meningococci or other
serotypes of pneumococci.
There is no evidence that meningococcal polysaccharide vaccines produce
cross-reacting immunity to other serogroups as there are no
cross-reactions between the serogroup antigens of groups A, B, and C. There
are, of course, many outer membrane proteins, the antigens responsible for
type-specifity of meningococcal serotypes, that are shared between
serogroups B, C, and Y.
