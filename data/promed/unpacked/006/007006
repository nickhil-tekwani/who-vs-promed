Malignant catarrhal fever (MCF) in South Africa was originally a controlled
disease in terms of Act 13 of 1956 and Act 35 of 1984. Because of the
sporadic nature of the cases and since the disease was generally regarded
of low priority in terms of its impact on the national cattle herd, it was
reclassified since December 1993 as a notifiable but not a controlled
disease. There is currently no accurate idea of its prevalence in the country.
Game farming has recently increased in popularity with the consequent
emergence of MCF as a problem to cattle farmers. In the past there were
steps related to wildebeest, such as increased control upon their movements
and required registration of properties with wildebeest. Subsequently, game
farmers expressed reservations following their perceived discrimination
against wildebeest as carriers of MCF while ignoring sheep as possible
sources of the virus. There seem to be no actual data to substantiate the
claim that movement restrictions had positive impact on controlling the
disease.
Diagnostic data from an Onderstepoort laboratory between August 2002 and
August 2003, using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) examinations, covered
347 investigated clinical MCF cases. 58 per cent of them were identified as
being due to AI HV-I. Only 8 per cent of received specimens were positive
for Ov HV-2.
The epidemiology of MCF is poorly understood. The Onderstepoort laboratory
is currently engaged in developing an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA) test to investigate whether cattle develop protective antibodies
when they co-habit with wildebeest; otherwise, another mechanism should be
responsible for their demonstrated low morbidity.

[Indeed, MCF typically appears in a sporadic form with a small number of
affected animals. However, there are few reports on higher morbidity rates;
a recent such outbreak has been reported by J Brenner et al in J Vet Med B
Infect Dis Vet Public Health 2002 Aug; 49(6): 304-7. For an abstract see
