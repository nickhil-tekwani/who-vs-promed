[Romania's follow-up reports no 11 (submitted 23 Sep 2014) and no 12 (submitted 24 Sep 2014) include the detailed statistics and other information pertaining to 112 and 15 new outbreaks, respectively.

Romania is a major exporter of sheep and cattle, particularly to European countries and the Middle East.

Bulgaria's 5th follow-up report, submitted 24 Sep 2014, includes the locations and detailed epidemiological statistics pertaining to 119 new outbreaks.

An interactive OIE map, showing all outbreaks in southeast Europe since the start of the BTV-4 epizootic in southern Greece in May 2014, is available at http://tinyurl.com/kkwxn7k. Click on the cluster, zoom in; the cluster in Italy is a separate one, caused by BTV-1. The single focus seen in northwest Bosnia-Herzegovina is in need for clarification, as discussed and requested in posting 20140920.2789774.

The BTV-4 strain causing the current major epizootic in southeast Europe is probably of west African origin, suspected to circulate also in Maghreb countries. Vaccination against this virus has been undertaken only in Turkey's affected European province, Kirklareli, where its spread was arrested by its immediate application in sheep. In the absence of vaccination in all other affected countries, its further spread, heavy economical losses, and animal suffering are unfortunately to be continued until the end of the vector season, expected when temperatures drastically drop. - Mod.AS
