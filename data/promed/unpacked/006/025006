A highly pathogenic avian influenza (AI) case was reported in South Korea on [Sun 25 Oct 2020], marking the 1st virulent bird flu case in the country in 32 months. The virulent avian influenza strain of H5N8 was discovered from a fecal sample collected from wild birds on [Wed 21 Oct 2020] in Cheonan, 92 km [approx. 57 mi] south of Seoul, according to the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs.

The discovery marked the 1st highly pathogenic AI case confirmed in the country since the H5N6 case, which is similarly virulent to H5N8, reported in the nearby Asan region in February 2018.

Highly pathogenic AI is very contagious and can make poultry very sick and even cause death.

The ministry has already restricted the movement of poultry and other livestock at 188 farms within a 10-km [approx. 6.2 mi] radius of the area after discovering a H5-type AI strain in the area earlier [see comment].

Authorities placed a travel ban on people and vehicles within a 500-meter [approx. 0.3 mi] radius of the location where the H5N8 strain was discovered. The purchase and sale of poultry at local markets in Cheonan will also be suspended until the travel ban is lifted.

"Given the precarious situation, we ask that all farms remain vigilant in terms of disease control as highly pathogenic AI cases could break out at farms at any given moment," a ministry official said.

[According to OIE's terrestrial code, avian influenza is defined as "an infection of poultry caused by any influenza A virus of the H5 or H7 subtypes". The S. Korean authorities have applied immediate preventive measures after the detection of H5N8 influenza A virus in a fecal sample of wild birds (thus non-poultry), even before its high pathogenicity established and serotyping completed.

According to the Code, "Infection with influenza A viruses of high pathogenicity in birds other than poultry, including wild birds, should be notified----"; "However, a Member Country should not impose bans on the trade in poultry and poultry commodities in response to such a notification". This relates to international trade, though countries are eligible to maintain more stringent policy intranationally. The measures undertaken in S.Korea by the veterinary authorities are meant to prevent the introduction of the pathogen into poultry farms.

The severity of the currently applied policy reflects past experience. During 2014, South Korea suffered a major HPAI H5N8 epizootic, devastating its poultry industry, which was shown to be introduced by migrating birds from China. According to the OIE reports, a total of 212 outbreaks were recorded before declaring the event resolved (in Mar 2015), leading to the culling of nearly 4.7 million birds (see, with map at https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000017334_20150313_170102.pdf).

Further details are expected in an OIE notification. - Mod.AS
