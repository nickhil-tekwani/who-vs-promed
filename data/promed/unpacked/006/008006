The Health Service Executive (HSE) is today [11 Dec 2008] continuing its
investigation into an outbreak of botulism among heroin users in Dublin.
The move follows the death of one person yesterday [10 Dec 2008]. The HSE
is investigating 6 possible cases of botulism over the last fortnight [14
days].

Botulism last occurred in drug users in Ireland in 2002, and in 2000, 8
drug users died when heroin contaminated with _Clostridium novyi_ was in
circulation in Dublin.

Alerts have been issued to drug services and relevant clinical staff in
emergency departments.

Botulism in heroin users still suspected
----------------------------------------
The Health Service Executive (HSE) was yesterday continuing to investigate
a suspected outbreak of botulism among heroin users in Dublin. The move
follows the death of one person from suspected botulism on Wednesday. Five
other suspected cases have been identified in the past fortnight and a
number of people are receiving anti-toxin treatment in hospitals. The HSE
said it was investigating whether a batch of contaminated heroin may have
been the cause of the outbreak. The infection, often attributed to food
poisoning, is caused by a toxin released by the clostridium botulinum
bacterium. "The disease usually affects long-term heroin users because they
tend to have poor veins as a result of a lifetime of injecting into their
veins, and so they are more likely to inject under the skin instead," said
Prof Joe Barry, HSE public health specialist. "If there's contaminated
heroin and you inject it into the skin it usually just sits there, whereas
if you inject it into veins the blood moves it along," he added.

Symptoms often begin with blurred vision and difficulty in swallowing and
speaking. Sometimes diarrhoea and vomiting can occur. The symptoms are
caused not by the organism itself, but generally by eating or breathing in
the toxin released by the organism. The disease can lead to problems with
vision and paralysis.

Although most sufferers make a recovery, this can take many months. The
disease can be fatal in 5 to 10 per cent of cases. Botulism last appeared
among drug users in Ireland in 2002. In 2000, 8 drug users died when heroin
contaminated with _Clostridium novyi_ circulated in Dublin.

Alerts have been issued to drug services and relevant clinical staff in
emergency departments. Drug users are being advised to seek medical help if
they experience neurological difficulties and if they develop abscesses.
