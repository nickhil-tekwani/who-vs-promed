A total of 13 swine died in the villages Monastirshina and Krtinitsa,
Voronezh oblast, because of classical swine fever [CSF]. This viral
infection originating from wild boars was not present in the oblast
almost 20 years. Currently, a month long quarantine measures are
applied and the swine population older than 40 days is being
immunized against this infection. The veterinarians say that there
are problems because the owners tend to hide the animals.
