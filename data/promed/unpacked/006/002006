Minister suspends badger culling in reactive areas of the randomised badger
culling trial
--------------------------------------------------
Animal Health Minister Ben Bradshaw made the following announcement today
(Tue) in a written statement to Parliament. "The Independent Scientific
Group on Cattle TB (ISG) was appointed by ministers in 1998 to design and
oversee a large scale field trial, the randomised badger culling trial
(RBCT), aimed at evaluating badger culling as a means to reduce the
incidence of cattle TB. The trial involves 3 experimental treatments: (i)
proactive culling, which aims to reduce badger densities to very low levels
across entire trial areas, (ii) reactive culling, which seeks to remove
only those badgers geographically close to recent cattle TB outbreaks on
particular premises, and (iii) no culling (survey only).
"The culling of badgers in reactive treatment areas of the RBCT will be
suspended from today. The decision to suspend the culling of badgers in
these areas has been taken on the basis of recent scientific findings from
the ISG. The ISG has advised ministers that its interim analysis of trial
data so far indicates that there was a 27 per cent increase in the number
of cases of bovine TB (breakdowns) occurring in reactive culling areas
compared to the related survey-only areas where no badger culling took place.
"I have decided to suspend operations immediately because of the risk that
a further 3 months of culling would cause additional TB breakdowns.
"The results that have now emerged from the reactive culling part of the
trial will be published as soon as possible in a peer-reviewed scientific
journal. Data on herd breakdowns from the reactive trial areas will
continue to be collected and subjected to further analysis with the more
detailed results being submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal
at a later date.
"On the advice of the ISG, operations will continue in proactive areas
because the data for these areas does not yet yield a statistically
significant result. The survey-only (control) areas will also continue to
be monitored.
"The governments policy on bovine TB is based on scientific advice and
these findings will be taken into account in the development of the
forthcoming TB strategy."
Notes to editors
1: The randomised badger culling trial was set up by ministers in 1998 to
establish whether badgers culling is an effective or sustainable bovine TB
control mechanism by comparing 2 different culling treatments with the
control area. Ministers appointed the ISG to oversee the design and
operation of the trial.
2: 30 areas of 100 sq km are included in the trial, grouped into 10
triplets. One of 3 "treatments" is allocated to each trial area. In a
"proactive" trial area badgers are trapped and culled at the outset of the
trial and at intervals afterwards. In a "reactive" area badgers are culled
only near those farms which have a confirmed incident of bovine TB during
the course of the trial. In the remaining "survey-only" area badgers are
left unhindered but badger sets are surveyed regularly to check for signs
of unlawful removal of badgers. This area acts as a scientific control
against which the impact of the 2 culling strategies can be measured.
3: Details of the RBCT trial can be found on the Defra website at
<http://www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/tb/culling/index.htm>
4: The 10 triplets are in the following areas ­- Gloucester/Herefordshire;
Devon/Cornwall; East Cornwall; East Herefordshire; North Wiltshire; West
Cornwall; Staffordshire/Derbyshire; Somerset/Devon, Gloucestershire, and
Devon/Cornwall.
5: The ISG statistics on culling of badgers in reactive treatment areas was
the subject of an informal review at the end of last week by Professor
Charles Godfray, chairman of the independent scientific panel reviewing the
RBCT.

[When I found the report of this in the London newspapers -- for example,
Telegraph:

<http://www.badger.org.uk/news/031104.htm> -- I asked Ricardo de la Rua, as
the DEFRA TB control officer, for comment and background, which he has
kindly provided. - Mod.MHJ]
The enclosed document (Minister's full statement to Parliament, see above)
summarises DEFRA's official stance and gives you some background to this
issue. You may also want to check DEFRA's TB website, which contains a Q&A
page on the announcement made yesterday:
<http://defraweb/animalh/tb/culling/index.htm>.
Please note that the randomised badger culling trial (RBCT, also known as
Krebs' trial) has not been suspended. The field trial continues, although
one of the 3 experimental treatments being applied from the outset of the
trial (namely, reactive culling of badgers on premises with a confirmed TB
incident in a cattle herd) has now been suspended. Field operations will
proceed as planned in the areas subjected to the other 2 treatments (that
is, proactive badger culling and survey-only (control)).
An analysis of RBCT data up to the end of August 2003 indicated that there
is an increased risk of TB breakdowns occurring in trial areas where
reactive culling has taken place, compared with the related survey-only
(control) areas. I am told this conclusion appears to be statistically
valid (I have not seen the data) and has been reached after taking into
account factors other than culling (for example, history of cattle
breakdowns in the area, number of herds, herd size, etc.), which may have
an impact on the number of breakdowns in a particular area. This outcome is
consistent across 9 of the 10 triplets; there has not yet been any reactive
culling in the 10th reactive trial area. The increase is estimated to be 27
per cent. The statistical approach used gives 95 per cent certainty to the
finding that the increase lies between 4 per cent and 53 per cent.
Ministers have decided it is not acceptable to continue culling operations
in these areas when we have scientific evidence that this increases the
number of TB breakdowns, and the Independent Scientific Group overseeing
the trial recommended it be halted.
I trust this gives you the information you require. If something is not
clear, let me know and I'll do my best to answer your questions.

[The background to this is that in the early 1970s bovine TB had
essentially retreated to Cornwall in SW England, where it was resisting
eradication for a number of reasons, with a few loci elsewhere. By the
1980s an association with badgers had been well-documented. Unfortunately
these very attractive wild animals have a loyal following in the UK and the
necessary gassing of badger sets had resulted in "rescue" operations by
badger lovers and the resultant appearance of tubercular dairy herds in
previously clean areas in southern and midland England. Along with the
major upsets of the 2001 FMD epidemic, the disease is now back to what it
was in the 1960s. - Mod.MHJ]
