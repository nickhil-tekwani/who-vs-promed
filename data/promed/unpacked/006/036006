Since the emergence of Ebola virus infection in 1976, no Ebola virus infected patient has been able to deliver her baby alive. Now, A 29-year-old infected Congolese woman has given birth and brought world attention to the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).

On Thu 13 Sep 2012 at Isiro hospital, staff did not know how to deliver her baby for fear of being infected. "The staff were guided by 2 eminent practitioners by telephone from Kinshasa, Professor and Doctor Mbungu Massamba, along with the Minister of Health, Dr. Felix Kabange Numbi," says RFI. The delivery went well, and the baby is safe and sound, although his prognosis remains unclear.

[The baby is still within the incubation period for an infection acquired during delivery. So far, the news is good. This report provides no information about the health status of the mother. The photograph that accompanies the report shows the medical staff in biosafety suits with respirators, eye protection, and full body covering, including the head. We hope that they and any other staff members were equally well protected with little or no danger of acquiring the infection from the patient.

The mother was admitted to the Isiro hospital. Isiro is the capital of Haut-Uele district, Orientale province, in the northeastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Orientale province is where the current Ebola outbreak has been occurring.

A map of the provinces of DRC is available at http://www.mapsofworld.com/democratic-republic-of-congo/democratic-republic-of-congo-political-map.html.
