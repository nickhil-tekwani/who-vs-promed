Susceptibility of Cats and Ferrets to SARS Virus
------------------------------------------------
Byron et al. [reference below] have reported experiments involving
experimental transmission of SARS coronavirus to 2 distantly related
carnivores in addition to those previously associated with the SARS
coronavirus. The Abstract of their paper reads as follows:

"The reservoir of the coronavirus isolated from patients with severe
acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is still unknown, but is suspected to
have been a wild animal species. Here we show that ferrets (_Mustela
furo_) and domestic cats (_Felis domesticus_) are susceptible to
infection by SARS coronavirus (SCV) and that they can efficiently
transmit the virus to previously uninfected animals that are housed with
them. The observation that these 2 distantly related carnivores can so
easily be infected with the virus indicates that the reservoir for this
pathogen may involve a range of animal species."

and ferrets. Brief communication, Nature 425, 915, 2003]

[The importance of this work is the conclusion that: "....the reservoir for
this pathogen may involve a range of animal species." Many people are
arguing that the exotic species held in markets in south China are the
source of this outbreak of human disease.

Unfortunately I have not yet seen the whole paper but according to
Henry Niman: "The Nature paper shows that domestic cats and ferrets
can be infected with SARS CoV (HKU-39849) and they can transmit the
virus to cage mates (and transmission to ferrets was fatal in 2/2 cases).
Data from domestic cats infected at Amoy Gardens show that the virus
isolated from at least one cat was an exact match of Amoy Garden
isolates from residents."

These data do not shed light on the origin of the SARS coronavirus, but
they caution against premature conclusions. - Mod.CP]
