Vaccines have been excluded as a possible source of the currently reported
nvCJD cases in the UK. In an article by Minor et al. (Vaccine, 2000, in
press) it is shown the vast majority of nvCJD cases were born and received
vaccinations before 1980, a generally accepted cut-off time at which BSE is
believed not yet to exist and hence impossible to transmit and generate
nvCJD. The same rationale would hold true for baby-food and other factors
associated with the early childhood of these cases.
