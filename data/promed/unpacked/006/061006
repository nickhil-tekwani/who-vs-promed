Two of the 26 dogs having come from South Korea in February [2019] have tested positive for canine brucellosis. Those dogs and any dogs who have come in contact with them have been segregated and are being tested.

Some of the dogs that have already been given to families have been placed in quarantine as well, HAWS [Humane Animal Welfare Society] says. In total, approximately 100 dogs are likely to require quarantine.

Canine brucellosis is a reproductive disease in dogs caused by _Brucella canis_ bacterium, mainly transmitted during breeding or birth. The infection is found worldwide but is rare in pet dogs in the USA. Animal-to-human transmission of this disease is rare.

The Wisconsin Humane Society is providing assistance by taking in dogs that would otherwise go to the affected shelters in order to reduce the need for additional quarantine.

[Recently we posted an alert about a new strain of canine distemper virus coming with dogs from South Korea (Canine distemper - North America: new dog strain 20190326.6388824) and now it is brucellosis in dogs from South Korea.

The lax import regulations of rescue animals coming into the USA is on the verge of a serious problem. The USA has quarantine facilities at ports for cattle, horses and other livestock. It needs to be expanded to include dogs and likely other animals. Imported rescue dogs especially need to have their vaccinations for prevention of rabies, distemper, parvo virus and other diseases. While being held at a facility, they should be checked for other diseases such as canine influenza and zoonotic diseases such as brucellosis.

Rescue animals from other countries need to be quarantined, not put in foster homes where there could be exposure to other animals or immunosuppressed individuals until some of these vaccines and testing have been performed. These quarantine facilities should be inspected by knowledgeable individuals according to law.

Brucellosis is a zoonotic bacterial disease caused by several species in the genus _Brucella_. _Brucella canis_ is an important cause of reproductive failure in dogs, especially in kennels. Infections can result in abortions and stillbirths in females, and epididymitis, prostatitis, orchitis and sperm abnormalities in males. Although spayed or neutered dogs do not have reproductive signs, they occasionally develop other conditions such as ocular disease and discospondylitis. _B. canis_ may persist in an animal even after antibiotic treatment. In kennels, infected dogs are often euthanized to prevent them from infecting other dogs or people. Canine brucellosis is sometimes difficult to diagnose [in dogs] with the currently available tests.

The importance of _B. canis_ as a cause of human illness is still unclear. Few clinical cases have been reported in people, and most have been mild. However, human infections with this organism may be underdiagnosed, as the symptoms are nonspecific, diagnostic suspicion among physicians is low, and obtaining a definitive diagnosis may be difficult (http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/brucellosis_canis.pdf).

Furthermore, immunosuppressed people, from cancers or other diseases, may be at a more significant risk. Veterinarians, veterinary technicians or nurses, and kennel help may also be more susceptible due to their more frequent exposure to urine.

One estimate has put the cost of the H3N2 canine influenza outbreaks that resulted from importation of Korean rescue dogs over USD 75 million for US dog owners due to veterinary care for sick pets, vaccinations, business losses during outbreaks at kennels/boarding facilities, etc. Add in the potential costs from another strain of distemper virus wildlife species in North America have no immunity to, and now Brucellosis, a human health risk. At what point should the USDA step in and stop the importation of these animals as the rescue groups certainly aren't bearing the true costs of their decisions to import these animals? The ethical considerations of this entire practice are also fascinating as we are effectively "saving" one group of dogs only to have them pose demonstrable risk to, and literally cause disease and death in, another population of dogs (and wildlife) already living here without the owners' or dogs' consent...surely there has to be a better solution. - Mod.JH
