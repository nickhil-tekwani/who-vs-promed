The Department of Health from the Generalitat (local autonomous government authority) declared that the 2 recent _Legionella_ outbreaks that occurred during the past few weeks in Sabadell and Ripollet, 2 municipalities [north of] Barcelona, are now under control. These outbreaks caused 8 deaths, and no new cases have been diagnosed in the last 10 days, although a 20-day period is necessary in order to declare the outbreak is over.

In the case of Ripollet, the origin of the outbreak has not been clearly established. Mr. Antoni Mateu, Public Health Secretary, declared that all studies performed indicate that 2 independent [outbreaks of legionnaires' disease occurred concurrently], and, in the case of Sabadell, the origin of the outbreak is (almost certainly) a refrigeration tower from the Tratamientos Termicas Carreras company, located at 38-42 Enginyer Playa street.

A circuit with "high doses" of _Legionella_ was found at the aforementioned company, which was preventively closed last Sunday [21 Sep 2014?], but the (Health) Department also warned that the available results are not definitive in order to be sure this tower is the source of this outbreak.

"Anyway, we hope to find the culprit for this situation that has led us to 2 severe outbreaks with significant mortality rates," said Mr. Mateu, who has not ruled out that other refrigeration towers in Sabadell may be contaminated with _Legionella_, and he warned that, in the case of Ripollet, they still have not determined the origin for this outbreak.

In this sense, Mr. Mateu declared that the "sole and exclusive" responsibility for the maintenance of such facilities falls on the company management, while the duty of the Generalitat is just to inspect such facilities. If that particular refrigeration tower is confirmed to be the origin for this outbreak, fines may fall between 60 000 and 600 000 Euros (USD 78 000 to 780 000). The Generalitat has already started to determine whether the refrigeration tower deemed as the origin for this outbreak has complied with every regulation with respect to its cleansing and maintenance.

Cases of legionnaires' disease started to appear on 10 Sep 2014, and an outbreak was declared 5 days later. At this point, the Catalonia Health Agency started to disinfect 38 refrigeration towers in 21 facilities in Sabadell.

At this time, the current _Legionella_ outbreak has affected 40 persons, and it caused the deaths of 5 individuals in Sabadell, where there are still 11 persons hospitalized; while 3 deaths were recorded in Ripollet, where there is no one hospitalized now.

Right now, 15 samples from the outbreak are being studied in Majadahonda (Madrid), in order to determine their origin, but Mr. Mateu pointed out that in up to 60 percent of the outbreaks, their origin cannot be determined.

[The tally for the outbreak of legionnaires' disease in the Comarca (county) of Valles Occidental, Catalonia, Spain, according to the news report above, is 40 cases, including 8 deaths. The news report in the 1st ProMED-mail post of this outbreak said that 20 of the initial 23 cases lived in the city of Sabadell, 2 in the town of Barbera del Valles, and one in the town of Cerdanyola del Valles (all in the Comarca of Valles Occidental) (ProMED-mail post Legionellosis - Spain: (CT) fatal 20140919.2788763). A subsequent post added 5 cases, including 3 deaths in the town of Ripollet, a municipality of 29 877 residents in Valles Occidental, which is located between the towns of Barbera del Valles and Cerdanyola del Valles (ProMED-mail post Legionellosis - Spain (02): (CT) fatal, update, RFI).

The proximity of the towns in Valles Occidental raise suspicion that all the cases of legionnaires' disease are linked, but this possibility is said in the news report above to have been ruled out by studies that indicate that the Ripollet cases are not related to the other cases; but we are not told what evidence backs this conclusion.

A cooling tower in Sabadell is the suspected source for all cases other than those that reside in Ripollet. This cooling tower was closed last Sunday [21 Sep 2014?], and no new cases have been diagnosed in the last 10 days.

Genotyping of patient and environmental _Legionella_ isolates may aid in establishing transmission pathways. The predominance of one genotype of _Legionella_ isolated from patient specimens would suggest transmission from a common source. Because _Legionella_ may be found in environmental samples without linkage to any cases of legionellosis, the actual causative infectious reservoir can be confirmed by matching the genotype of clinical and environmental isolates (see http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC86783/ and http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2730281/). However, this is often difficult in legionellosis outbreaks, because the diagnosis of legionnaires' disease is frequently made only on the basis of urinary _Legionella pneumophila_ serogroup 1 antigen testing or serology rather than isolation of the organism from cultures of respiratory tract specimens. Consequently, clinical isolates are often not available for genotyping.

Sabadell is the 2nd largest city, with a population of 207 938 people, in the southern portion of the Comarca of Valles Occidental, in Catalonia, Spain, 20 km (12 miles) north of Barcelona (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabadell). (A comarca is roughly equivalent to a US "county.") Barbera del Valles is a city of 29 208 people in Valles Occidental, 3 km (1.9 miles) south of Sabadell (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barberà_del_Vallès). Cerdanyola del Valles is a city of 58 747 people in Valles Occidental, 4.4 km (2.7 miles) south of Barbera del Valles (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerdanyola_del_Vallès).
