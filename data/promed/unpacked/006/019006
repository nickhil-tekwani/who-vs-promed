99/091 EPPO report on selected intercepted consignments [edited
--------------------------------------------------------------
The EPPO Secretariat has selected interceptions made because of the
presence of pests.
When the occurrence of a pest in a given country is not known to the EPPO
Secretariat, this is indicated by an asterisk (*).
Pest, Consignment, Type of commodity, Country of origin, Country of
destination, number of interceptions
_Ralstonia solanacearum_, _Solanum tuberosum_, Ware potatoes, Syria*,
United Kingdom, 1
Note: The EPPO RS 99/032 mentioned a French interception of ware potatoes
contaminated by _Synchytrium endobioticum_ from Germany. The German NPPO
has informed the EPPO Secretariat that further investigations done by both
countries have shown that Germany was most probably not the country of
origin. However the exact origin of the consignment could not be traced
back with certainty.

[For various reasons, including smuggling & incomplete paperwork, plant
consignments do not always actually come from the putative country of
origin, as in the report about supposedly German potatoes in the Note
above. Therefore it cannot yet be said with certainty that Syria was the
origin of the infected potatoes - Mod.JW
