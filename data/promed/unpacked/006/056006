Investigations have not found a link between the deaths of 2 local
pig farmers of a pneumonia-like illness in the past 6 months. Centre
for Health Protection consultant Dr Thomas Tsang said the men tested
negative for SARS.
An inter-departmental working group meeting was held today to look
into these 2 cases and a package of new measures were mapped out to
enhance investigation, surveillance and risk communication with the community.
Dr Tsang said the family members of the 2 deceased have no symptoms.
Evidence collected by the Agriculture, Fisheries & Conservation
Department found no unusual deaths among local pigs in Hong Kong.
However, he said the Government will continue investigations and
liaise with Mainland officials. The Centre and the Hospital Authority
will form a special arrangement that requires doctors report
pneumonia cases among hospitalised pig farmers and live pig handlers.
North District Hospital reported a pneumonia case today, involving a
61-year-old man who works in Sheung Shui Slaughterhouse. His
condition is stable.
A special hotline 2125 1133 has been launched for pig farmers to
report any pneumonia hospitalisation they may have had since 1 Jun
2006. It has received 7 calls so far. Six were for enquiries. One was
from a 42-year-old male safety supervisor of Sheung Shui
Slaughterhouse who had been hospitalised at North District Hospital
for pneumonia in mid-September 2006. His illness responded to
antibiotics and he has recovered. He had no direct contact with pigs at work.

The Centre for Health Protection is investigating the death of 2
local pig farmers who succumbed to a pneumonic illness in the past 6
months. Laboratory tests have not identified a specific bacteria or
virus causing the pneumonia. Further investigations are needed to
ascertain the nature of a possible infectious illness and any
relation it may have with pigs.
A 44-year-old Sheung Shui man came down with fever and cough on 7 Dec
2006. He was admitted to North District Hospital on 11 Dec 2006 and
died of a pneumonia-like illness on 13 Dec 2006. He visited Dongguan
about 20 days before the onset of symptoms, but an association
between this travel and his illness cannot be established yet.
Another case involved a 62-year-old Tsuen Wan man who developed a
similar illness and was admitted to Yan Chai Hospital at the end of
May. He died on 4 Jun 2006. The Centre is following up on his travel history.
Five family members of the 44-year-old patient and a worker at his
farm have no symptoms. Family members of the 62-year-old patient will
be tested. The Centre has also followed up on a pig farmer
acquaintance of the 44-year-old whom he had visited in Queen
Elizabeth Hospital in early December. This acquaintance had a
pre-existing lung disease and kidney problems and had been
hospitalised since the end of October. His clinical presentation was
different from the victims.
The Centre's Consultant Dr Thomas Tsang appealed to pig farmers who
have suffered from pneumonia-like illnesses and required
hospitalisation since 1 Jun 2006 to call 2125 1133 for follow-up advice.
The Centre has been liaising with Mainland health authorities, and
the Agriculture, Fisheries & Conservation Department has reminded
local farmers to report any pig disease outbreak and abnormal pig
death. So far there has been no unusual increase in the mortality
rate of pigs in local farms. There have also been no unusual pig
diseases found.

[The information provided is not sufficient to allow speculation as
to the nature of these undiagnosed cases of respiratory illness. They
are unlikely to be related to avian influenza virus or SARS virus
infection in view of the expertise available in Hong Kong in relation
to diagnosis of these virus infections. The absence of disease in
swine and probable antibiotic sensitivity discount any involvement of
Nipah virus or _Streptococcus suis_, which in any case do not cause
respiratory disease in man. Further information would be welcomed. -
