The Hawaii Department of Health is investigating 2 cases of hepatitis A in Kauai residents. Symptoms began in November 2017, and health officials say the strain of the virus in both cases appears to be the same one currently circulating in California.

Dr Sarah Park, state epidemiologist, says the 2 cases appear to be unrelated. One traveled to California, but "for the other case, we've not been able to discern any type of travel, so that becomes concerning," Park said. "Potentially, this strain has been introduced into Hawaii, and we don't know if it's just going to be this small cluster, a focused cluster, or larger."

California's hepatitis A outbreak originated in San Diego and has spread statewide and to other states. The outbreak was identified in early March 2017, and prompted the San Diego County public health officer to declare a local public health emergency in September 2017. The majority of the cases were among people who were homeless, used illicit drugs, or a combination of the 2. Localized data out of San Diego as of 2 Jan 2018 puts the total number of cases there at 577 with 20 deaths and 396 hospitalizations.

Hawaii travelers to the mainland may become infected during their visit and can accidentally bring that infection home with them. The virus is found in the stool of people with hepatitis A infection and is usually spread through close personal or sexual contact as well as by eating contaminated food or drinking water. A person who has hepatitis A can easily pass the disease to others within the same household.

It's a good reminder, Park says, for residents to get vaccinated for long-term immunity. "As our investigators continue their work, we want to remind Hawaii residents that hepatitis A vaccination is highly effective in preventing infection," she said. "With large, multi-state outbreaks occurring across the country, it is important that we all take precautions to prevent hepatitis A infection whether at home, work, recreating, or traveling."

While vaccination provides the best protection, frequent handwashing with soap and warm water after using the bathroom, changing a diaper, or before preparing food can help prevent the spread of hepatitis A. Appropriately cooking food and using safe food handling practices can also help prevent infection.

The state is investigating a pair of hepatitis A cases on Kauai. Investigators say the symptoms of the patients in these cases -- which were 1st observed in November 2017 -- are consistent with a strain responsible for a deadly outbreak of the disease in California. Hundreds of people have been sickened in that outbreak, and more than 19 people have died.

The state is warning Hawaii travelers who have visited the mainland, particularly the San Diego area, to be aware that they may have become infected during their trip. "As our investigators continue their work, we want to remind Hawaii residents that hepatitis A vaccination is highly effective in preventing infection," said Dr Sarah Park, state epidemiologist. "With large, multi-state outbreaks occurring across the country, it is important that we all take precautions to prevent hepatitis A infection." The state did not release any additional information about the newly-reported cases on Kauai.

Hepatologist Dr Naoky Tsai said he's surprised the virus didn't arrive in Hawaii sooner. "We have so many trips between here to San Diego, it should be very quickly transmitted," Dr Tsai said. The outbreak spread quickly in homeless camps throughout San Diego, leaving nearly 400 hospitalized. Since September 2017, public health agencies have installed dozens of hand-washing stations and cleaned streets with bleach-spiked water.

Hawaii's outreach workers say they are armed with their own tools to promote cleanliness. "Our donors provide us with millions of hygiene products," said Kimo Carvalho with the Institute for Human Services. "We actually package and provide them to clients on the street to prevent these types of outbreaks."

Hawaii is no stranger to hepatitis A cases. Clinics and pharmacies across Oahu reported a surge in patients last May 2017 when it was reported that poke that tested positive for the virus had been sold at several eateries. An outbreak of hepatitis A in Hawaii in 2015 sickened hundreds of people, and at least one woman who ate tainted scallops died of liver failure.

[It appears that the cases, which seem epidemiologically unrelated to each other, are linked to the outbreak, currently diminishing, in the San Diego area of southern California. No information about risk factors in the cases is stated. - Mod.LL
