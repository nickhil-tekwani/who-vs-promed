I would like to ask for clarification on a point raised in the attached
post. In particular the advice that people should "look, taste or smell
before you eat". My understanding is that one of the reasons that these
dinoflagellate toxins are such a problem is that they are not readily
detected by sight, taste or smell. This type of advice from journalists,
if incorrect, could lead to a false sense of safety for the
public, since the foods appear "safe".

Having personal experience, the advisory look, smell, [and taste are not
adequate watch words. Such somatic senses are incapable of detecting
infected shellfish
