Suspected human case of avian flu in Bali
-----------------------------------------
Bali Husbandry Agency head I.B. Alit stated that avian flu was still
present on the island of Bali, mostly among domesticated fowl.

In addition, a pregnant woman from Gianyar Regency is being treated at
Sanglah Hospital for avian flu [avian influenza A(H5N1) virus
infection]. Her unborn baby was dead.

[According to the WHO Timeline
(<http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/Timeline090727.pdf>)
there has been no confirmed case of avian influenza (H5N1) virus
infection in Indonesia since the beginning of 2009. There have been
many tens of suspected cases reported in local Indonesia newspapers.
In early August a human case was reported on the island of Bali (see:
Avian influenza, human (107): Indonesia (Bali) susp. 20090807.2797),
but this has not subsequently been confirmed. The present report must
be regarded with some scepticism, pending confirmation from an
official source.

The island of Bali can be located using the HealthMap/ProMED-mail
interactive map of Indonesia at
<http://healthmap.org/r/00DM>. - Mod.CP]

[It should be noted that in 2008 Indonesia said it would no longer
routinely report cases of avian flu because of the negative reactions
by other coubtries. - Mod.JW]
