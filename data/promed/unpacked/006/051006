re: Professor Studdert's comments on the equine influenza outbreak in
Australia
-----------------------------------------------
Professor Studdert in ProMED-mail post "Equine influenza - Australia (10):
(NSW, QLD) 20070918.3108" commented as follows: Individual horses clear the
virus within 2 weeks following infection, and there is no long-term carrier
status after recovery, and there are no known alternative or reservoir
hosts. These features render equine influenza eminently controllable and
eradicable.
I am not arguing with the premise that it may be possible to eradicate
equine influenza from Australia, but given the recorded transmission events
of equine H3N8 strains to dogs both in the US and the UK (see reference [1]
and [2] below), I would not say that there is no known alternative host. I
don't know whether back transmission from dogs to horses has been observed,
so the reservoir statement may be correct.
