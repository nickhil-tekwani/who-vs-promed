Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
National Veterinary Institute (national laboratory) / common goldeneye / real-time PCR / 22 Nov 2016 / Positive
National Veterinary Institute (national laboratory) / Common goldeneye / virus sequencing / 23 Nov 2016 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: genome of H5 avian influenza virus was detected in 4 samples from carcasses of domestic birds (goose, hen, guinea fowl). Sequence analysis of the isolates showed that they belonged to the Asian HPAI virus H5 lineage A/Guangdong/1/96, clade 2.3.4.4.

[Sweden is now the 9th country in Europe to report HPAI subtype H5N8. To date, the affected countries and the number of outbreaks per country is as follows:

Country / no. of outbreaks in poultry / no. of outbreaks in wild birds
Austria / 1 / 1
Croatia / 0 / 1
Denmark / 0 / 10
Germany / 0 / 9
Hungary / 14 / 1
Netherlands / 0 / 8
Poland / 0 / 3
Switzerland / 0 / 62

This information was obtained on 23 Nov 2016 from the OIE WAHID database at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/Immsummary (note: to see the information select the disease and year).

According to the analysis made by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, Animal & Plant Health Agency, Veterinary & Science Policy Advice Team - International Disease Monitoring- UK, published on 11 Nov 2016 (https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/568082/uoa-hpai-europe-20161111.pdf): "These findings suggest there are at least 2 potential migration routes for wild birds which may be infected with this virus strain. Firstly, Poland, northern Germany, Denmark, and Netherlands on a Northern Baltic route and Croatia, Hungary, Southern Germany, Switzerland, and Austria along a central European route to include the Danube and Mediterranean route. Migratory birds are currently moving from the Baltic into NW Europe and the UK. The pattern of this year's [2016] reports is different to previous years (2014/15) when this virus was first detected in Europe. The mortality events and the species of wild waterfowl affected might indicate possible changes in virus pathogenicity and/or changes in host specificity. However significant uncertainties exist at this early stage and other wild waterfowl species may be infected without mortality.

"The number, rate, mortality, and geographic spread of these new cases in wild birds is significant and shares some features with the initial spread of H5N1 HPAI of the goose/Guandong lineage of viruses to Europe in late 2005/early 2006."

In June 2016, Russia reported an outbreak of HPAI H5N8 where several wild birds were affected. See event summary and map at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?reportid=20335. The precise origin of the Tyva 2016 H5N8 virus remains unknown although available evidence suggests it was derived from earlier H5N8 viruses detected in Eastern China (WHO 2016). The virus is readily distinguishable from strains of H5N8 virus found in Europe and North America in 2014-15 (http://www.fao.org/ag/againfo/programmes/en/empres/news_031116b.html).

Although the neuraminidase has not yet been typed, there is a high likelihood that these findings may also be associated subtype H5N8. -Mod.CRD
