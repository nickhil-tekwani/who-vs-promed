I am a bit worried about the header of this news: "City veterinarians
warn of killer virus from goats," as this makes people believe milk
or meat of goats tested positive for CAE are a "deadly feast."

I have been breeding dairy goats for a long time and had been
involved in the early stages of the eradication programme in our
county. Although I certainly agree that products of sick or diseased
animals should be discarded per strict hygiene rules, separation of
negative/positive animals and rearing kids of positive dams
artificially on milk replacer could be a much better way to stop the
virus from spreading than culling vast numbers of goats that will be
replaced by animals that could harbour the virus undetected.

Lab diagnosis of CAE is a problem, as even infected animals can stay
negative for quite a time. Only several negative blood test results
over a period of approximately 2 years are sufficient to rule out CAE
infection in most cases. There is the odd one slipping through; I am
not up to date with recent developments, but we used to hear the
term: "slow virus disease," meaning that it could take a couple of
years before a positive blood test (usually AB-ELISA) comes back.

In spite of a close relationship between humans and goats and sheep
for centuries, there has never been any clinical evidence that the
CAE and closely-related Maedi-visna retroviruses infect humans. Both
viruses have been documented in herds worldwide and were probably
introduced to the Philippines over 10 years ago from a herd imported
from the USA.

The officials in Manila are clearly overreacting to a situation that
presents no danger for local residents, but recommended measures
could result in economic harm for small farms. Instead, goat keepers
should be given accurate information so they can test their herds and
begin the only CAE eradication program that works: rearing kids on
pasteurized milk. Burning the carcasses is an extreme measure which
will do nothing to prevent the most common way that the virus is
spread, from infected dams to kids.

The virus can be transmitted only rarely from contaminated
instruments or open wounds, but it would be highly unlikely if not
impossible to transmit an enveloped retrovirus to other farms on
contaminated boots. Like all retroviruses, CAEV does not survive
outside the host for more than a few minutes.

It would be interesting to learn whether the city vet is testing only
goats with visible signs. It is well accepted that only about 20
percent of goats that test positive for the virus exhibit signs of
CAE.

[Both of these readers make excellent comments. Clearly, the
officials are not wanting any type of disease to enter the human food
chain, and they have chosen a fearful way to insure compliance vs.
providing accurate information on what to expect and how to help the
producers.

This article focused entirely on goats, and I confined my comments to
that. But Karin and Sabine have taken me to task for not having
included Maedi-visna in my comments, as it is a very similar disease.
It would be nice to know what clinical signs the sheep are
demonstrating, and then a more accurate epidemiological picture might
begin to emerge.

Regrettably, the diagnostics for these similar diseases are not the
best. Yes, they are better than nothing, but they highlight another
area of an old existing disease that we still do not have a good
handle on diagnostically, nor do we as veterinarians or scientists
completely understand the pathobiology of why it is a "slow virus
disease."

Thanks to all the readers who sent comments. - Mod.TG]
