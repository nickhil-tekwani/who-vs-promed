[ProMED-mail thanks Steve Berger for providing this chronology of rabies in imported animals, abstracted from the Gideon Database. It appears that the relevant importation regulations are widely evaded and that no single country is more deficient in this respect. However, Morocco features more frequently as the country of origin of rabid exported livestock. - Mod.CP]
