I have 2 comments to add:
(1) Do we also need to consider the risks from working with
animals in a laboratory setting? These may be deliberately
infected with zoonotic agents or else naturally infected (see
MMWR 36(19) 1987 - Secondary transmission of herpes B).
(2) As regards reporting of laboratory accidents, there is a duty in
the UK [legislation passed in 2000] to report any infection reliably
attributable to work (including that in a laboratory) or any accident
or incident which results in, or could have resulted in, the release
of a Hazard Group 3 or 4 biological agent.
<http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/hse31.pdf>
<http://www.hse.gov.uk/statistics/causdis/infect.htm>
Those reported infections and incidents that occur in CL3 and CL4
laboratories (equivalent to BSL-3 and BSL-4) are currently
independently investigated by Health and Safety Executive
Specialist Inspectors (of which I am one).
There is also a duty in UK (and EU) legislation to report accidents
involving significant and unintended releases, outside primary
containment, of GMOs [genetically modified organisms. - Mod.JW] -
- see: <http://www.hse.gov.uk/dst/acgm32/paper4.htm>.
Enquirers can make approaches to HSE via our information
helpline <hseinformationservices@natbrit.com> for general
information, as this is held centrally by the HSE Statistical Units.
But I do have direct access to the numbers of incidents (both GM
and non-GM) that have been investigated by the unit that I work for -
- during 2003 we investigated at least 14 laboratory incidents/
accidents (I say at least, because some of the incidents have not
been coded properly) and 2 laboratory-acquired infections. We
also investigated 3 GM accidents (this became a duty in 2000 -- all
reports from Members States are passed to the European
Commission).
Unfortunately, I can't let you have details about the non-GM
incidents, because the information we collect in the course of an
investigation is protected (in part) by the Health and Safety at Work
etc Act 1974 (Section 28) -- we would have to deal with any
requests on a case-by-case basis. However, you may find a
general approach via the infoline (above) sufficient for your
purposes. Information about the GM accidents is kept on a public
register, and you can request this information via our notifications
officer <diane.fox-purday@hse.gsi.gov.uk>.
We have published information on lessons learnt from investigating
such incidents since 2000 which may be of use to ProMED -- see
<http://www.hse.gov.uk/dst/acgm31/paper9.htm> and
<http://www.hse.gov.uk/dst/acgm32/paper8.htm>).

I think the issues Tony Della-Porta raises [see ref. (02) below] are
of most import, but beyond what he has to say is a new system of
political correctness which is overriding laboratory safety and
human health.
We must move to bring laboratories in all parts of the world to the
same standards and not assume that an "Institute" in the former
USSR is modern. I had a chance to visit the medical school at
Semipalatinsk (7 Tents), Kazakhstan, in September 1990. The
training laboratory there was well below what one would expect to
find in a 2nd-rate United States high school, much equipment
having been donated without instruction, and my guide was the
director of the medical school.
The biophysics laboratory at Al Farabi University in Almaty, visited
in March 1991, was also at the high school level but well below
Semipalatinsk -- so much for being the largest university in the
country.
We cannot allow places that lack facilities and trained, intelligent
personnel to carry on.

[I would hope things have improved at Russian universities in the
last decade, but have serious doubts. Can someone who has
seen Russian research labs more recently give us an update? -
