Further comment on the appropriate containment level
-----------------------------------------------
There should be no question as to the containment level for work with
this strain of influenza A virus. The differences between containment
level 3 (BSL3) and containment level 4 (BSL4) are significant, both
in the physical aspects of the laboratory, and, perhaps more
importantly, in the operational practices.
A valid risk assessment of the consequences of release would dictate
that this research be carried out in a certified maximum containment
(BSL4) facility.
