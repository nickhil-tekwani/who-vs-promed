[Since the officially reported start of the lumpy skin disease (LSD) epizootic in north east Israel on 1 Jul 2012, a total of 30 outbreaks have been reported to the OIE, including the 11 new outbreaks reported in the follow-up report above.

The origin of the LSD virus introduction is apparent when one looks at the map showing all 30 accumulated outbreaks, at the bottom of the OIE summary report, available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000012559_20121112_153839.pdf. Unfortunately, Israel's information on LSD remains solitary in the region.

So far, the disease has affected primarily beef cattle. A single event in dairy cattle started on 24 Oct 2012 in Kibbutz Dafna, upper Galilee. The report says: "Till 11 Nov 2012, this is the sole LSD case in a milk cow."

According to OIE's summary, the following figures are given in relation to the accumulated 30 outbreaks:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Cattle / 13 721 / 3125 / 296 / 6 / 0

This extensive outbreak, evolving since 1 Jul 2012, has been handled mainly by quarantine measures and "vaccination in response to the outbreak" of beef and dairy cattle within and around the affected zone. "Modified stamping out" has been limited to 6 animals.

It would be interesting to obtain information on the efficiency of the applied vaccine in protecting the bovines. - Mod.AS]
