Influenza Update 159
------------------
Summary
- The seasonal peak for influenza has passed in most countries in the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere.

- Different viruses have predominated in different parts of the world in the northern hemisphere 2011-12 influenza season. In North America, Canada had a slight predominance of influenza B over influenza A(H3N2) (67 vs. 33 percent respectively) particularly later in the season, while in the United States of America (USA), the proportions were reversed and A(H3N2) was more common. Mexico's season was almost all related to influenza A(H1N1)pdm09. In Europe, the large majority of influenza viruses have been influenza A(H3N2) with only very small numbers of A(H1N1)pdm09 and B. In Asia, northern China and Mongolia reported mostly influenza B early in the season with influenza A(H3N2) appearing later, though this sequence was reversed in the Republic of Korea and Japan where A(H3N2) was predominant initially and influenza B appeared later.

- At the beginning of the influenza season, most viruses tested were antigenically closely related to those found in the current trivalent seasonal vaccine. However, by mid-season, divergence was noted in both the USA and Europe in the A(H3N2) viruses tested and significant numbers of A(H3N2) viruses tested in recent months have shown reduced cross reactivity with the vaccine viruses. Influenza B virus detections have been both from the Victoria and Yamagata lineages with the former slightly more common in China and parts of Europe.

- Resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors has been low or undetectable throughout most of the season; however, a slight increase in levels of resistance to oseltamivir has been reported in influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 isolates in the USA. Most (11/16) of these oseltamivir resistant cases have been from the state of Texas, where influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 has been the most common virus circulating.

Source of data
The Global Influenza Programme monitors influenza activity worldwide and publishes an update every 2 weeks.
The updates are based on available epidemiological and virological data sources, including FluNet (reported by the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System) and influenza reports from WHO Regional Offices and Member States. Completeness can vary among updates due to availability and quality of data available at the time when the update is developed.

[According to the most recent ECDC [European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control] Weekly Report (http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications/Publications/120511-SUR-WISO.pdf): All countries in Europe except Slovakia reported low-intensity influenza activity. Of 154 sentinel specimens tested, 23 (14.9 percent) were positive for influenza virus. This proportion has been continuously decreasing over the past 10 weeks.

The A(H3N2) influenza viruses examined at the WHO Collaborating Centre in London show increasing evidence of an imperfect match between the circulating viruses and the A(H3N2) vaccine antigen used in 2011.

There has also been a significant rise in the proportion of B/Yamagata viruses among the B viruses detected this season. These findings supports the WHO recommendation to modify two components in the trivalent vaccines for the 2012/2013 Northern Hemisphere season.

The 2011-12 influenza season in the northern hemisphere is coming to its end, and it is difficult to predict what will be the predominant strain in the next influenza infection season. A curious feature of the past season has been the persistence of the A/(H5N1)v virus in Mexico and in contrast its decline and partial eclipse elsewhere. - Mod.CP]
