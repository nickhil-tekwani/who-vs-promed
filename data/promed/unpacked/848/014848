Outbreak of bird flu in Romania that of deadly H5N1
confirmed
-------------------------------------------------------------
Romania's Agriculture Ministry said Sat 15 Oct 2005 British
lab tests have confirmed the H5N1 strain of Bird flu [which]
had been found in Romania.
Lab tests in Britain have shown that an outbreak of bird flu
in Romania is H5N1, the strain that is potentially highly
pathogenic to humans, the Romanian state veterinary
authority said on Saturday.
The tests on 3 ducks found dead in Romania's Danube delta
near the Black Sea last week confirmed fears that the
disease, which has killed more than 60 people in Asia since
2003, has entered Europe.
"We have received telephone confirmation from London that it
is the H5N1 virus," Alina Monea, spokeswoman at Romania's
veterinary and animal health authority, told Reuters.
A European Commission spokesman in Brussels said: "We are
waiting for the results which are supposed to be coming from
Britain at about 1 p.m (1100 GMT) (Saturday). "I cannot
confirm or deny (the report) but the Commission was acting
with the presumption that it would be this more dangerous
type and took all the preventative measures," the spokesman,
Robert Soltyk, said.
Turkey also reported an outbreak of the deadly strain
earlier this week.
Experts fear H5N1 could mutate into a virus which spreads
easily among humans, creating a pandemic that might kill
tens of millions. Romania has not reported any cases of bird
flu so far in humans.
The Danube delta contains Europe's largest wetlands and is a
major migratory area for wild birds coming from Russia,
Scandinavia, Poland, and Germany. The birds mainly move to
warmer areas in North Africa including the Nile delta for
winter.
Officials in Romania have announced plans to slaughter
thousands of birds to prevent the disease from spreading.
