Authorities from the Health Corporation [Corposalud] of Tachira confirmed
an outbreak of Chagas disease in the Andean region Junin municipality [near
the border with Colombia], where 6 positive cases (one fatal) were
identified. Relatives of the child who died of the disease last Sunday [7
Nov 2010] remain under observation since they were positive with the rapid
test.

The information was communicated by the director of Corposalud, Juan de
Dios Delgado, who stated that it is probable that the outbreak spread via
the oral route, through foods contaminated by the parasite, given that none
of the patients presented with bites or scratches.

Regarding the 5 infected patients, Delgado indicated that they are
relatives of the 2 year old girl who died of the disease last Sunday [7 Nov
2010], and they are under observation in the Central Hospital in the city
of San Cristobal. Delgado reported that epidemiologic and environmental
health studies are under way in the suburban sector of La Palmita, in the
city of Rubio, where the affected family resides and where another
suspected case is being verified. About 42 samples have been obtained in
order to detect other possible cases, but most have resulted negative. A
technical team has been created to analyze the situation and determine the
necessary measures to stop the spread of this outbreak of acute Chagas in
the state. "Public health inspectors are actively searching for the source
of infection, that is, the vector carrier of the parasite _Trypanosoma
cruzi_, by means of an epidemiological barrier together with fumigation and
cleanup of the area," he said.

Delgado called on the residents of Junin to be alert to symptoms of
abdominal pain, malaise, and fever, which might indicate a possible
infection, and consult the closest health center to determine whether they
have the disease. He also urged people to use potable water and follow the
correct hygienic measures when handling food and in the areas where it is
prepared in order to stop the spread of the disease.

The director of Corposalud urged the people of Tachira to remain calm and
abide by hygiene measures when handling food. He explained that when a
"chipo" [_Rhodnius prolixus_ or "kissing bug"] infected by the parasite
(_T. cruzi_) bites, it defecates, and the infected feces enter the
bloodstream of the person when he/she scratches the site, causing the disease.

[ProMED-mail has covered several outbreaks of Chagas disease due to
contaminated food or fruit juice. The largest outbreak took place in
Caracas (see below) in 2007. Foodborne Chagas disease appears to be
emerging as an important source of transmission contributing to continued
infection of new hosts. - Mod.EP
