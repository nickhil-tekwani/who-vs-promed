The Agriculture Department has extended a recall of about 2 million pounds
of meat and poultry used by prisons, hospitals and schools because new
testing turned up continued _Salmonella_ contamination at a Georgia
processing plant.
The recall of cooked patties of beef, pork and chicken took effect Sept. 28
for products shipped by Zartic Inc. of Cedartown, Ga. The cooked patties
went to "institutional users" only and were not sold in stores, USDA
spokeswoman Linda Swacina said Saturday. There have been no reports of
illness caused by contaminated Zartic products, she said. "The cause is
still under investigation," she said.
Tests on two samples from the same plant tested positive for _Salmonella_
Oct. 6, and the voluntary recall was extended to cover all products from
the company's three production lines, a notice from the federal Food Safety
and Inspection Service said. The recall covers what was produced between
Aug. 7 and Oct. 7 and shipped to 34 states.
While _Salmonella_ contamination is not rare, the problem usually occurs in
raw meat and poultry, Swacina said. "You don't expect to find pathogens on
cooked products," Swacina said.
The affected meat was shipped to Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, California,
Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas,
Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota,
Missouri, Mississippi, North Carolina, New Jersey, New Mexico, Nevada, New
York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota,
Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, Wisconsin, West Virginia.
[N.B.: The reason for the recall was that the _Salmonella_ was present
after cooking. This means either improper cooking or contamination
post-cook. -- RAL
