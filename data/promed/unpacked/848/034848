Anthrax in animals in Tamil Nadu
-------------------------------------
According to a report in The New Indian Express (Chennai edition, 23
Oct 2006), 17 cows have died of anthrax during the past week in
Uthankarai in Krishnagiri district in the northern part of Tamil
Nadu. The information was given by the District Collector, Santhosh
Babu, and according to him, autopsies [sic. necropsies] proved the
cause of death. [The team also administered vaccines to around 1200
cows in the taluk, he said. - Mod.JW]

[To quote Jacob John: "In the absence of systematic and comprehensive
disease surveillance in the various states of India, we learn about
outbreaks only from newspapers. Obviously only newsworthy outbreaks
are reported." India does provide reports to OIE in Paris, but in
general he is correct. This part of Tamil Nadu has regular outbreaks
of anthrax, due to the under-regulated and uncontrolled tanning
industry. Necropsy is not a good method for diagnosing anthrax, as it
provides a large amount of environmental contamination, is not
accurate, and puts many people and animals at risk. Plus, the mess is
a real pain to clean up if you want to do it correctly. Laboratory
confirmation is reliable.
