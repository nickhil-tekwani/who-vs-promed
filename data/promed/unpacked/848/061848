It has been confirmed that the Japanese Encephalitis (JE) vaccine used for
8300 school children was all from the same manufacturer and was the
inactivated (killed) virus form ("Inactivated JE vaccine"). After the
reported adverse events in school children in Herongjiang province, the
government authority arranged testing for the vaccine by collecting samples
randomly from the anti-epidemic station (vaccination center).
The samples of the inactivated JE vaccine were tested in the National
Institute for the Control of Pharmaceuticals and Biological Products
(NICPBP), Beijing, to determine whether the particular lot [should have?]
failed the lot release test. According to the officials from NICPBP,
nothing out of the ordinary was found in the vaccine samples. All children
hospitalized have recovered within a couple of days following
hospitalization.
For more than 30 years, both inactivated and live vaccines have been used
in controlling JE in China. At least 4 manufacturers have been involved in
manufacturing and distribution of inactivated vaccines in areas where live
JE vaccine has not been distributed. Some children living in non-endemic
areas, including HeirongJiang province situated in the Northeast of China,
have received
inactivated JE vaccines, although the majority of children residing in
non-endemic areas have not been recommended to receive any vaccination
against JE.
A few of the inactivated JE vaccine manufacturers have recently replaced
their products with live-attenuated JE vaccine that was developed by Dr
Yongxin Yu. The live JE vaccine has been used in more than 150 million
people in China since 1989, with no serious adverse events reported among
the vaccine recipients according to the Chinese CDC. The live JE vaccine
has been shown to be safe and highly effective in several epidemiological
studies. One large safety study conducted as a randomized trial in 25 000
school children showed that none of the vaccine recipients reported any
serious adverse events, and there was no significant difference in the
frequency of mild to moderate clinical events between vaccinated and
unvaccinated subjects during the 30 days following the vaccination [Liu,
Z.L., H. S, and S.B. L, Short-term safety of live-attenuated
Japanese encephalitis vaccine (SA14-14-2). J Infect Dis, 1997. 176: p.
1366-69.].
At present, no one may easily determine whether the series of the abnormal
reactions reported in the recipients of inactivated JE vaccine were caused
by the JE vaccine or other factors, although there was obviously a temporal
association between vaccination and the abnormal reaction. It will be
important for the Chinese government to make its best effort in
investigating the likely causes of the reported abnormal reactions in the
recipients of inactivated JE vaccines under the cooperation with the
particular manufacturer. At the same time, the Chinese government should
educate the public appropriately in order to alleviate any unreasonable
fear over vaccine safety. This could potentially avoid the situation seen
in the UK, where there is a decline in acceptance of the MMR vaccine and
the resultant adverse influence, leading to an increase in the number of
measles cases.

[Many thanks to Dr. Sunheang Shin for providing us with more information
from official sources on this adverse event following receipt of the killed
JE vaccine in China. Follow-up from official sources is far superior to
relying on the lay press for information on adverse health events. We look
forward to hearing additional information on the investigation of this
event as it becomes available. - Mod.MPP]
