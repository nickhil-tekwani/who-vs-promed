News
----
- The Ebola Emergency Committee confirmed this Wed 12 Feb 2020 that the ebolavirus disease epidemic in the Democratic Republic of the Congo remains a public health emergency of international concern.
- "As long as there is a single case of Ebola in a region as unstable and insecure as the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the potential for a much larger epidemic will remain," said the Director-General of the World Health Organization, Dr. Tedros. He acknowledges, however, that given the developments on the ground, the signs are "extremely positive in eastern DRC," and he hopes the declaration of the end of this 10th epidemic before a new meeting of the emergency committee.
- The general coordinator of the response to the ebolavirus disease epidemic participated in a teleconference from Goma, capital of North Kivu province, in this meeting of the Emergency Committee with the Director General WHO deputy, Dr. Socce Fall.
- The provincial minister in charge of health and social affairs of Ituri, Patrick Karamura Mwira, closed this Wednesday [12 Feb 2020] the 2 days of work to validate the operational plans of the SRP4.1 against ebolavirus disease held 11 and 12 Feb 2020 at the Cap Kivu Hotel in Goma in the province of North Kivu.
- This workshop resulted in 7 recommendations, among which included the integration of response activities to the measles epidemic underway in the Beni health zone in the PAO, the effective organization of monitoring of population movements allowing detection early of suspect cases or people at risk, and regular supply of coffins for the realization of dignified and secure burials (EDS) in the sub-coordination of Mangina.
- There is also the continuation of pleas to the Congolese Government for the management of the security elements assigned to the Entry/Control Points, to conduct a plea at the central level for the final establishment of the cadres of the Provincial Divisions of the health (DPS), for the transfer of skills to the DPS teams and the integration into the DPS communication plan of activities to combat other diseases with epidemic potential.
- Minister Patrick Karamura therefore invited all stakeholders to mobilize by implementing planned activities to interrupt the chains of transmission and end the epidemic of ebolavirus disease, resulting in the declaration of the end of this 10th epidemic by June 2020.
- "This workshop allowed the institutional analysis within the framework of the transfer of competences and responsibilities towards the green health zones which do not register any more confirmed cases for 21 days or more and the Provincial Divisions of health with an overall vision to be ready to assume responsibilities with prerequisites for material and technical support," said EVD Epidemic Coordinator in charge of operations, Dr. Luigino. The partners in the response, meanwhile, are committed to supporting this process.
- For the partners in the response, represented by Dr. Ilham Ibrahim Abdel Nour, Program Officer at the Office of the Director-General of WHO, the commitment to support the response remains. They promise to bring their technical, financial and operational support to all the initiatives of the Congolese government as well as the general coordination of the response to the epidemic of the ebolavirus disease and the DPS.
- The Provincial Health Divisions will take on the management of the response in green areas. To this end, the general coordinator of the response to the ebolavirus disease, Prof. Steve Ahuka Mundeke, who participated in these meetings in the morning, said that the management of ebolavirus disease is in this case a great responsibility shared between the DPS and the general coordination of the response and will be done with the partners.

Vaccination
-----------
- 12 233 people were vaccinated, as of 7 Feb 2020, with the 2nd vaccine Ad26.ZEBOV/MVA-BN-Filo (Johnson & Johnson) in the 2 health areas from Karisimbi to Goma;
- Since the start of vaccination on 8 Aug 2018 with the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine, 293 958 people have been vaccinated.

Surveillance at entry points
----------------------------
- A 28-year-old woman, contact never seen and at high risk on the 16th day of follow-up, was intercepted at the PK5 checkpoint in Beni in North Kivu. This contact, with unknown vaccination status, was given to surveillance for follow-up.
- A 2nd day without health control activity at the Makeke1 Control Points, Makeke and Bella detour following the insecurity in Mangina in Mabalako in North Kivu;
- Since the start of the epidemic, the total number of travelers checked (temperature measurement ) at health checkpoints is 150 242 642;
- To date, a total of 109 entry points (PoE) and health control points (PoC) have been established in the provinces of North Kivu and Ituri in order to protect the country's major cities and avoid the spread of the epidemic in neighboring countries.

- Thu 13 Feb 2020. Disease outbreak news: Update
[WHO Disease Outbreak News, abridged, edited]
https://www.who.int/csr/don/13-february-2020-ebola-drc/en/

This week the case incidence continued to be low in the ebolavirus disease (EVD) outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (see Figure 1 at the source URL). From 5 to 11 Feb 2020, 3 new confirmed cases were reported in Beni Health Zone, North Kivu Province. All 3 cases have epidemiological links to a transmission chain originating in Aloya Health Area, Mabalako Health Zone, with possible nosocomial exposure in Beni. The most recent case reported from Beni Health Zone on 11 Feb 2020 was isolated one day after symptom onset. Early detection of cases reduces the probability of transmission of EVD in the community and significantly improves the clinical outcome for the patients.

In the past 21 days (22 Jan-11 Feb 2020), 12 confirmed cases, including 3 community deaths, were reported from 4 health areas within 2 active health zones in North Kivu Province (see Figure 2 and Table 1 at the source URL): Beni (n = 11) and Mabalako (n = 1). It has been 42 days since Katwa Health Zone has reported new cases. The continued reduction of geographic spread of EVD cases and the declining trend in case incidence observed in the past 21 days are encouraging; however, these improvements remain fragile and should not be interpreted as an indication that response efforts can be reduced. Continued vigilance is essential to improve infection prevention and control in healthcare facilities, as well as ensuring early identification and follow up of cases and contacts.

As of 11 Feb 2020, a total of 3432 EVD cases were reported, including 3309 confirmed and 123 probable cases, of which 2253 cases died (overall case fatality ratio, 66%) (see Table 1 at the source URL). Of the total confirmed and probable cases, 56% (n = 1923) were female, 28% (n = 968) were children aged less than 18 years, and 5% (n = 172) of all reported cases were healthcare workers.

On 12 Feb 2020, the WHO Director-General reconvened the Emergency Committee under the International Health Regulations (IHR). The Committee reviewed progress in the implementation of the Temporary Recommendations issued on 18 Oct 2019. Updates on the outbreak were provided by representatives of the Ministry of Health of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the UN Ebola Emergency Response Coordinator and the WHO Secretariat. The situation in neighbouring countries was reviewed, as well as preparedness in nonaffected areas of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It was the view of the Committee that this event still constitutes a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC). Further details can be found in the Emergency Committee Statement (https://bit.ly/2OX1Ceq).

On 10 Feb 2020, WHO published new guidelines (https://bit.ly/2vAbiEM) for healthcare providers regarding the management of pregnant and breastfeeding women in the context of ebolavirus disease. The document reviews existing evidence and provides a single set of recommendations on the care continuum for women exposed to, diagnosed with, or recovered from ebolavirus disease, and will enable healthcare providers, emergency response teams and health policy-makers to improve prevention and treatment measures in an EVD outbreak. The news release of this guideline can be found at https://bit.ly/2SstY25.

[CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy), abridged, edited]
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/02/news-scan-feb-13-2020

All 3 confirmed Ebola cases reported in the past week in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) involved known transmission chains, which is a good sign, but volatile situations still plague the outbreak region, the World Health Organization (WHO) said yesterday [12 Feb 2020] in its weekly situation report.

The WHO said that from 3-9 Feb 2020, all 3 confirmed ebolavirus disease (EVD) cases were in Beni in North Kivu province. Over the past 21 days, officials confirmed 13 new cases -- 12 in Beni and 1 in Mabalako, which is also in North Kivu province. Three of those patients died, all in the community, which raised the risk of disease spread.

"Although recent trends of this outbreak, including the small number of weekly cases and limited geographic area affected by EVD are encouraging," the WHO said, "continued vigilance is crucial, particularly for contact identification and follow up, in order to interrupt possible nosocomial transmission linked to traditional practitioner facilities."

"The security situation in several EVD-affected health areas remains unstable and unpredictable," the WHO added. "On 8 Feb 2020, a health centre was attacked in Butembo, destroying equipment and infrastructure. On 8 Feb 2020, an attack on civilians in Mabalako Health Zone led to a suspension of response activities for 48 hours."

Since 9 Feb 2020, the WHO has logged 2 new cases -- one on 10 Feb 2020 and one yesterday [12 Feb 2020]. The DRC's Ebola technical committee (CMRE) said the case reported yesterday was in Beni. No new cases were reported today [13 Feb 2020], according to the WHO's online dashboard, keeping the outbreak total at 3432 cases, including 2249 deaths. Authorities are tracking 461 suspected cases.

- Wed 12 Feb 2020. WHO: Ebola still public health emergency
[Local 10, abridged, edited]
https://www.local10.com/news/world/2020/02/12/un-congos-ebola-outbreak-slows-but-still-global-emergency/

The World Health Organization (WHO) said although signs are now "extremely positive" in Congo that the ebolavirus disease (EVD) outbreak is winding down, the epidemic remains a global health emergency.

To date [12 Feb 2020], EVD has killed more than 2200 people in Congo, making it the second-deadliest epidemic in history. The decision to maintain WHO's global emergency declaration for EVD came after a meeting Wednesday [12 Feb 2020] of WHO's Ebola expert committee.

"As long as there is a single case of Ebola in an area as insecure and unstable as eastern (Congo), the potential remains for a much larger epidemic," said WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.

Much of the outbreak has struck regions of Congo described as war zones, and health workers have been under repeated attacks from numerous rebel groups and from communities wary of international aid workers.

Tedros said he hoped that by the time the Ebola expert group meets again -- likely within 3 months -- that they will be able to declare an end to the EVD epidemic. He said he would be travelling to Congo later this week to meet with the country's president and senior government officials to discuss ways to strengthen the country's healthcare system.

[3] Munich Security Conference
- Sat 15 Feb 2020. Tedros speech
[WHO, abridged, edited]
https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/munich-security-conference

Excellencies, distinguished guests, dear colleagues and friends,

Thank you for the opportunity to address you today [15 Feb 2020]. And especially my appreciation to my friend Ambassador Ischinger.

Yesterday [14 Feb 2020] I was in Kinshasa, in the Democratic of the Congo (DRC), meeting with the President and other senior ministers to review progress against the Ebola outbreak and work together on a plan to strengthen DRC's health system so that it never sees another outbreak like this again.

I'd like to thank the President for his leadership, and for his vision of a healthier and safer DRC.

We are finally starting to see the possibility of ending this outbreak, after more than 18 months and the loss of 2249 lives. In the past week there has been just one case of Ebola, compared with 120 cases a week at the peak in April [2019].

This epidemic stands in stark contrast to the previous Ebola outbreak in the western part of DRC in 2018, an area that is relatively stable and peaceful. That outbreak was controlled in just 3 months.

This experience illustrates a key lesson of history: disease and insecurity are old friends.

It was no coincidence that the 1918 flu pandemic erupted in the middle of the First World War and killed more people than the First World War itself.

It's no coincidence that the final frontier for eradicating polio is in the most insecure regions of Pakistan and Afghanistan.

It's no coincidence that Ebola has spread in the most insecure region of the DRC.

Without peace, health can be an unattainable dream.

But the opposite can also be true: Epidemics have the potential to cause severe political, economic and social instability and insecurity.

Health security is therefore not just the health sector's business. It's everybody's business.

There are 3 main scenarios in which a coordinated response between the health and security sectors is essential:

First, high-impact epidemics in situations of conflict and insecurity, such as Ebola. In the last few years, 80% of outbreaks requiring an international response have occurred in countries affected by fragility, conflict and insecurity.

Second, the emergence of a pathogen with pandemic potential, moving rapidly from country to country and requiring an immediate and large-scale response in countries.

And third, the deliberate or accidental release of biological agents -- a hopefully rare event for which we must nonetheless be prepared.

[Read the full talk for Tedros' discussion of COVID-19. Regarding both ebolavirus disease and COVID-19, Tedros raises important points with a focus on the need for preparedness in the face of insecurity. Maintaining a strong public health infrastructure will go a long way toward protecting the population when new pathogens arise. But Tedros states that "Two years ago, WHO and the World Bank founded the Global Preparedness Monitoring Board, an independent body to assess the state of the world's readiness for a pandemic. Last year the board published its 1st report, which concluded the world remains badly prepared." This is a serious problem. Being prepared requires funding such efforts, training personnel, and a strong surveillance system. - Mod.LK
