Predatory birds apparently have spread a fatal disease to trout at a state-run fishery.

Workers are killing 25 000 fish in an effort to contain the outbreak of furunculosis at the Pequest Trout Hatchery in Oxford, Warren County, said the state Division of Fish and Wildlife. The disease, which is caused by a bacterium, was found recently in part of a concrete raceway system used to raise trout, said David Chanda, the division's director.

"We are taking all precautions to contain this disease," Chanda said Tuesday [17 Sep 2013]. He said the hatchery expects to have "ample supplies of 2-year-old trout" for the fall stream-stocking season, but "super-sized" 3-year-old trout and brown trout won't be available.

The hatchery, which raises more than 600 000 trout annually, will distribute about 20 000 fish in the fall [2013]. These fish have tested negative for the disease, which cannot be transmitted to humans, the division said.

State officials think ospreys and herons, which feed on infected fish in the wild, may have spread the bacteria to the fishery.

"The hatchery already uses an elaborate system to deter birds, including air cannon, electrified fencing, and cables strung out over the pools," the division noted in a statement. "But the birds have figured out a way to enter the pool area by swooping in horizontally, thus evading the cables. The hatchery is now investigating using a full covering system."

Chanda said workers will euthanize 2500 fish in a pool known to be infected with the disease. The remaining 22 500 fish will be euthanized as a precaution in a pools/raceway system downstream of the affected pool.

The affected areas will be drained and disinfected, and equipment will be cleaned.

Officials said it is "never advisable" to eat any diseased-looking fish or animal.

Signs of furunculosis include darkening of the skin of affected fish as well as boils and lesions.

[Furunculosis is a serious, septicemic, bacterial disease that occurs principally in salmonid fishes. The disease is caused by a Gram negative bacterium, _Aeromonas salmonicida_.

The disease may be acute or chronic, with a variety of clinical signs. It generally appears to develop as a septicaemia and is often fatal. Affected fish often show darkening of skin, lethargy, and inappetence [loss of appetite]. Haemorrhages may occur at the bases of fins and the abdominal walls, heart and liver. Enlargement of the spleen and inflammation of the lower intestine are common features of chronic infections, but in acute outbreaks fish may die rapidly with few signs. The disease is named after the raised liquefactive muscle lesions (furuncles) which sometimes occur in chronically infected fish.

The major route of transmission appears to be via infected fish and contaminated water. Although the disease causes mortality of all ages, the most serious losses occurs during spring to autumn in the sea water farms. An important aspect of furunculosis is the carrier state, which is often established after the fish have been exposed to _A. salmonicida_. Clinical outbreaks and mortality appear to be triggered by stress factors such as crowding, poor water quality, fright, high temperature, and physical trauma.
