[According to the data on the Worldometer website, the total number of cases of COVID-19 worldwide is now 245 916, with 80 967 cases reported by China. There are now a total of 164 565 confirmed cases of COVID-19 reported from 170 countries/locations outside mainland China representing an increase of 26 514 cases when compared with the data on 18 Mar 2020, with Italy accounting for 5322 of the newly reported cases, Iran for 1046 of newly reported cases, and South Korea for 87 of the newly reported cases. Spain (3308), Germany (2993), France (1861), and the USA (4964) are major contributors to this increase as well. The total number of confirmed cases reported from outside of China now represents 66.9% of the total number of reported cases. The epicenter has shifted outside of China to Western Europe. A global total of 8968 deaths have been reported, 6800 outside mainland China.

For the 22nd consecutive day, more cases have been reported from outside mainland China than within mainland China. The total number of deaths reported from outside of mainland China is now greater than the total number of deaths reported by mainland China. Mainland China has gone 2 days without any locally transmitted cases; South Korea has slowly decreased daily new case counts. But cases in the USA are escalating very rapidly and Europe's rise is equally daunting. It would be interesting to see an epidemic curve by date of onset to see what the true curve of transmission is. - Mod.MPP]

[The big news, this is now day 2 with no newly confirmed, locally acquired cases in China in the past 24 hours. While 2 days isn't a definitive interruption of transmission it certainly is a very promising early trend. The challenge will be to identify all imported infections before they can escape from detection and start spreading in the community.

According to the report above, a total of 80 967 cases of confirmed COVID-19 have now been reported from mainland China, representing an increase of 39 cases in the past 24 hours since yesterday's (18 Mar 2020) report was prepared. In addition, 3 deaths were reported, 2 of them by Hubei province. 16 new cases were reported from Hong Kong, which bears watching as the cases have been slowly but steadily climbing. Macau reported an additional 2 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours.

All 39 newly confirmed cases were imported cases into China representing 100% of all reported cases in the past 24 hours. Cases were reported by Guangdong (14), Beijing (6), Shanghai (8), Fujian (3), and 1 each in Tianjin, Liaoning, Heilongjiang, Zhejiang, Shandong, Guangxi, Sichuan, and Gansu, bringing the total number of imported cases to 228.

[Note that the reporting interval is now midnight to midnight, presenting the full calendar day. In the past 24 hours, the tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea has increased by 87 cases and 3 deaths as compared with yesterday's 24 hour period (18-19 Mar 2020) when there were 152 newly confirmed cases. It is comforting that the 24 hour case count has returned to below 100; hopefully this will be a continuing trend toward interruption of local transmission. Daegu continues to stand out as a focal point for transmission with 72.5% of the total cases reported followed by Gyeongbuk with 13.9% of the total cases reported. Looking at recent activity, Daegu reported 39.1% of the newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, followed by Seoul reporting 19.5% of the newly confirmed cases, Gyeonggi with 16.1% of the newly confirmed cases, and Gyeongbuk with 14.9% newly confirmed cases.

[The tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy is now, 41 035 cases, including 3405 deaths, up from 35 713 cases and 2978 deaths reported on 18 Mar 2020. The 24-hour change between 18 and 19 Mar 2020 was 5322 newly confirmed cases, compared with 4207 newly confirmed cases between 17 and 18 Mar 2020. Cases continue to be concentrated in Lombardy (19 884), the epicenter of the outbreak, Emilia-Romagna (5214), and Venice (3484), all in the northern part of the country, but there are signs the case loads may be increasing outside of these 3 northern provinces. On 17 Mar 2020], these 3 provinces accounted for 62.7% of newly confirmed cases in the preceding 24 hours, down from 73.8% of newly confirmed cases in the prior 24 hours. On 18 Mar 2020 the proportion of newly confirmed cases in these 3 provinces has decreased further to 54.3% of the total newly confirmed cases and today they represent 58.8% of the total newly confirmed cases reported. The growth in cases in the northern provinces continues, but apparently the growth in other provinces is continuing at a more rapid pace. There is an excellent interactive map at http://opendatadpc.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/b0c68bce2cce478eaac82fe38d4138b1 to visualize the caseloads per region in near real time.

On 9 Mar 2020, Italy announced a lockdown for the northern provinces where the outbreak was concentrated. On 10 Mar 2020, this was changed to be countrywide. On 11 Mar 2020, Italy announced the closure of non-essential businesses. As for seeing an impact, one shouldn't expect to see an impact until at least one incubation period has passed, as there are newly infected individuals who are still in their incubation period for up to 14 days. That being said, there is no trend for stabilizing or decreasing the daily number of new cases that are confirmed. As mentioned before, the Public Health world is looking at Italy to see if this is feasible and if it has an impact in terms of slowing down transmission of the virus.

C. Iran: 18 407 cases, 1284 deaths

Iranian authorities announced on Thursday [19 Mar 2020] that the country has registered 149 new deaths from the new coronavirus, raising the toll to 1284. A total of 18 407 people have contracted the disease in Iran, with 1046 new cases confirmed in the last 24 hours.

"In 11 provinces" out of 31, "the number of infections has decreased because people have followed our guidelines", Raisi said, renewing the call for Iranians to stay home. Tehran province had the highest number of new cases, with 137 reported, followed by the central province of Isfahan, with 108 and Gilan in the north with 73.

For several weeks, Iranian authorities, who have so far refused to impose confinement or quarantine measures, have asked the population to refrain from travelling and to take the virus "seriously," AFP reported. Several provinces have also ordered the closure of hotels.

Meanwhile, Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei said will pardon 10 000 more prisoners in an apparent effort to combat the new coronavirus, state TV reported Thursday [19 Mar 2020]. Up to 85 000 prisoners were released earlier on temporary leave to curb the spread of COVID-19.

The Middle East has some 20 000 cases of the virus, with most in Iran or originating from Iran.

Iran's Health Ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour warned Iranians in a social media post that the virus infects 50 Iranians on average every single hour and that "one dies every 10 minutes."

"Make smart decisions about travel, visits, and meetings," he wrote on Twitter, as highways remained crowded with people traveling to see family ahead of Nowruz, the Persian New Year [20 Mar 2020].

[In the 24 hours from 18 to 19 Mar 2020, the number of cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Iran grew from 17 151 to 18 407 an increase of 1256 newly confirmed cases. The number of deaths has also increased from 1135 to 1284, an increase of 149 deaths in the 24 hour period. The number of cases continues to grow at an alarming rate, with reports of deaths of many notable figures in the country and of international fame. This seems to be a repetitive story, countries' health sectors being overwhelmed with the pandemic. Wuhan China began, followed by Italy, and now Iran.

[5] Infection rates in China, comment
Date: Thu 19 Mar 2020
From: T Jacob John <tjacobjohn@yahoo.co.in> [edited]


In continuation of my earlier discussions, here is my take about China situation.

With 1.4 billion population, they have 90 000 COVID-19 cases globally understood as SARS-CoV-2 infections, for an incidence density of less than 0.1%. Correcting for lack of testing in November [2019], may I generously assign 1% as incidence density. So this is a very inefficiently spreading virus in China.

The epidemiological characteristics of this virus in China and outside China look very different. Alternatively, China had several orders of magnitude higher incidence. A disease with 1% burden within China could not have become pandemic unless one of 3 things are accepted.

- One, the virus has become far more transmissible outside China.
- Two, China had a much larger case burden.
- Three, a huge proportion of infected have no disease demanding testing.

I prefer the 2nd explanation. If China has high herd effect helping drastic reduction in new cases, at least 70 ("guesstimate") per cent were infected.

For 1% infected, the number would have been 14 million.
For 10% infected, the number should be 0.14 billion infected.
For 50% infected, the number would have been 0.7 billion.
For 70% infected the number would have been 0.98 billion

Are we not missing a massive elephant?

It is extremely important for us to forecast the probable burdens proportional to population sizes in various countries.

[The interesting observation within China, was that while spread outside of Hubei province did occur, the volume of cases was never as impressive as within Hubei, and the mortality observed among reported cases was significantly lower (0.2%) than that seen in Hubei Province (2.6%) (The Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Emergency Response Epidemiology Team. The Epidemiological Characteristics of an Outbreak of 2019 Novel Coronavirus Diseases (COVID-19) -- China, 2020[J].

As of 14 Mar 2020, there were a total of 67 790 confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection reported from Hubei and a total of 81 021 cases reported for the entire country so Hubei represented 83.7% of all cases in the country. - Mod.MPP]

A Tasmanian woman on a cruise ship that arrived in Sydney on Thursday [19 Mar 2020] has been confirmed as having coronavirus. The woman is 1 of 4 cases of coronavirus among passengers and crew who disembarked from the Ruby Princess.

Director of Public Health Mark Veitch said the woman is in Sydney and is being managed by New South Wales Health.

Meanwhile, another passenger who was on the ship has been admitted to hospital in Tasmania with respiratory symptoms and will be tested for the virus.

Dr Veitch said Tasmania's Public Health Services had been advised there were 54 Tasmanians onboard the vessel. "New South Wales Health is currently contacting all passengers," he said. "Passengers will be reminded of their requirement, as returned overseas travellers, to remain in self-quarantine for 14 days after they reach their home destination."

Dr Veitch said Public Health Services will also contact the Tasmanian passengers. "Passengers still in Sydney who have symptoms should not board domestic flights and should follow the advice provided to them by New South Wales Health," he said.

"All travellers returning to Tasmania from overseas travel are required to complete a Tasmania Arrivals Card and self-quarantine for 14 days upon arrival. "Whilst in self-quarantine they must monitor for symptoms of coronavirus infection and call their GP or the Public Health Hotline if they get symptoms."

[The cruise ship sagas continue... This time the script is a bit different as all passengers have disembarked and are mixed in the general population. Given the nature of this pandemic organism (the SARS-CoV-2) that seems to transmit rapidly and somewhat silently before the storm, one has to seriously consider if there should be a moratorium on cruise ship sailings. - Mod.MPP

Fears grow for dozens -- potentially hundreds -- of New Zealanders stranded at sea with limited medication and food after countries across the globe close their borders to limit the spread of COVID-19. One Auckland woman is terrified for the wellbeing of her 65-year-old retired parents who were 2 of 37 Kiwis on board the Norwegian Jewel operated by Norwegian Cruise Line. "My dad has heart disease and mother is diabetic and they starting to ration their medication, charging NZD 9 [USD 5.2] a tablet, because they are running low. I'm extremely worried," [she] told the Herald.

Her parents boarded the luxury cruise ship from Auckland on [28 Feb 2020] -- before the potentially deadly virus had escalated in New Zealand. "They booked it a 1.5 years ago -- it was meant to be their retirement celebration trip. They travelled to Fiji before getting turned away, then they tried Tahiti, then New Zealand, and were now lurking the seas near Honolulu, Hawaii, which closed its borders just yesterday [19 Mar 2020].

[This woman] said as far as she was aware no one on board the cruise ship was showing symptoms or was in self-isolation.

The Hawaii Department of Transportation has announced as a precautionary measure to prevent spread of COVID-19 it will not allow passengers on the Maasdam operated by Holland America Line and the Norwegian Jewel operated by Norwegian Cruise Line, to disembark. "The health and safety of all people in Hawaii is always at the forefront of operational decisions. Presently, all state resources are focused and directed towards containing the spread of COVID-19. Allowing more than 2500 passengers and crew to disembark will further strain these resources," Jade Butay, the director of Hawaii Department of Transportation (HDT), told ABC news.

It comes after Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced last Saturday [14 Mar 2020] all cruise ships were banned from coming to New Zealand until [30 June 2020].

[In this instance, the cruise ships are going from port to port in search of a place to dock. Similar to the cruise ship that finally was able to dock in Cambodia back in February 2012, around the time of the Diamond Princess saga. One wonders if there are no cases after 2 weeks at seas without docking if that will serve as "self quarantine" for all crew and passengers. - Mod.MPP]

[7] WHO situation report 59 (as of 19 Mar 2020)
Date: Thu 19 Mar 2020

https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200319-sitrep-59-covid-19.pdf?sfvrsn=c3dcdef9_2


*The situation report includes information provided by national authorities as of 00:00 CET

Highlights
----------
- Seven new countries/territories/areas (African Region [3], Eastern Mediterranean Region [1], European Region [1], and Region of the Americas [2]) have reported cases of COVID-19.

- The number of confirmed cases worldwide has exceeded 200 000. It took over 3 months to reach the 1st 100 00 confirmed cases, and only 12 days to reach the next 100 000.

- A new protocol to investigate the extent of COVID-19 infection in the population, as determined by positive antibody tests in the general population has been developed. The protocol is titled the Population-based age-stratified seroepidemiological investigation protocol for COVID-19 virus infection (https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/early-investigations). See 'subject in focus' for details.

Subject in focus: New protocol for early epidemiologic investigations for public health response
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
With the emergence of COVID-19 virus, many uncertainties remain as to certain epidemiological, seroepidemiological (related to identifying antibodies in the population), clinical and virological characteristics of the virus and associated disease. Studies to assess these characteristics in different settings are critical to furthering our understanding. They will also provide the robust information needed to refine forecasting models and inform public health measures.

As such, WHO, in collaboration with technical partners, has adapted early epidemiological investigations protocols from pandemic influenza and from MERS-CoV, to better understand these characteristics and how they may be used to inform public health measures.

To date, 5 early seroepidemiological core protocols and data collection forms are available on the WHO COVID-19 Technical guidance website (https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/early-investigations).

All protocols propose a standardized methodology to allow data and biological samples to be systematically collected, taking into consideration local setting and outbreak characteristics, and shared rapidly in a format that can be easily aggregated, tabulated and analyzed across many different settings globally.

Study protocol
--------------
The First Few X (FFX) Cases and contact investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection (https://www.who.int/publications-detail/the-first-few-x-(ffx)-cases-and-contact-investigation-protocol-for-2019-novel-coronavirus-(2019-ncov)-infection)

Objectives
----------
To provide descriptions and/or estimates of the:
- clinical presentation of COVID-19 infection and course of associated disease;
- secondary infection rate (SIR) and secondary clinical attack rate of COVID-19 infection among close contacts (overall, and by key factors such as setting, age and sex, for various end-points);
- serial interval of COVID-19 infection;
- symptomatic proportion of COVID-19 cases (through contact tracing and laboratory testing); and identification of possible routes of transmission

Study protocol
--------------
Household transmission investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection (https://www.who.int/publications-detail/household-transmission-investigation-protocol-for-2019-novel-coronavirus-(2019-ncov)-infection)

Objectives
----------
- to better understand the extent of transmission within a household by estimating the secondary infection rate for household contacts at an individual level, and factors associated with any variation in the secondary infection risk;
- to characterize secondary cases including the range of clinical presentation, risk factors for infection, and the extent and fraction of asymptomatic infections;
- to characterize serologic response following confirmed covid-19 infection

Study protocol
--------------
Protocol for assessment of potential risk factors for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection among health care workers in a health care setting
(https://www.who.int/publications-detail/protocol-for-assessment-of-potential-risk-factors-for-2019-novel-coronavirus-(2019-ncov)-infection-among-health-care-workers-in-a-health-care-setting)

Objectives
----------
- to better understand the extent of human-to-human transmission among health care workers, by estimating the secondary infection rate for health care worker contacts at an individual level;
- to characterize the range of clinical presentation of infection and the risk factors for infection among health care workers;
- to evaluate effectiveness of infection prevention and control measures among health care workers

Study protocol

Surface sampling of coronavirus disease (COVID-19): A practical "how to" protocol for health care and public health professionals
(https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/331058/WHO-2019-nCoV-Environment_protocol-2020.1-eng.pdf)

Objectives
----------
- to assess the extent and persistence of surface contamination with COVID-19 virus;
- to identify environmental surfaces which may play a role in onwards transmission of COVID-19 infection;

Study protocol
--------------
Population-based age-stratified seroepidemiological investigation protocol for COVID-19 virus infection (https://www.who.int/publications-detail/population-based-age-stratified-seroepidemiological-investigation-protocol-for-covid-19-virus-infection)

Objectives
----------
- To estimate age-specific seroprevalence

The latest protocol, the Population-based age-stratified seroepidemiological investigation protocol for COVID-19 virus infection, is intended to provide key epidemiological and serologic characteristics of COVID-19 virus in the general population. Specifically, data from this protocol will provide critical information about the extent of infection (as measured by the presence of antibodies in study subjects) in the general population, age-specific infection cumulative incidence, and the fraction of people with asymptomatic or subclinical infection.

The results of these investigations, whether individually or pooled across study sites/countries, will allow further understanding and provide robust estimates of key clinical, epidemiological and virological characteristics of the COVID-19 virus, including:
- Key epidemiological parameters, such as: secondary infection rate and secondary clinical attack rate of COVID-19 infection among close contacts, asymptomatic fraction of infection, serial interval and incubation period of COVID-19, the basic reproduction number of COVID-19 infection.
- Clinical presentation of COVID-19 infection and course of associated disease.
- Risk factors for transmission and infection, and identification of possible routes of transmission.
- Impact of infection prevention and control measures in health care settings.
- Serological response following symptomatic COVID-19 infection.
- Age-stratified seroprevalence of antibodies against COVID-19 virus.
- Cumulative incidence of infection, including extent of age-specific infection.
- Infection and disease-severity ratios (case-hospitalization ratio [CHR] and case-fatality ratio [CFR]).
- Viral load and shedding profiles.
- Viral persistence on surfaces.

To date, 13 countries across 5 of the 6 WHO regions, including both high-income and low-and middle-income countries, have begun to implement at least one of the early investigation protocols. A further 18 countries have signaled their intention to implement one of the protocols. WHO will continue to support countries in their epidemiological investigations through the provision of clear and comprehensive protocols.

[As mentioned in the highlights above, WHO has now shifted from a 0:00 to 23:59 period for the preceding day in presenting data on confirmed cases reported to WHO. As this change just occurred, one sees variances in reported cases in the table that appear as though countries updates weren't entered. This should resolve moving forward. - Mod.MPP]

These data come from Table 1: Countries, territories or with reported laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths. Data as of [12:00 AM 19 Mar 2020] Mar 2020], available at the source URL above. I am presenting the regional case totals without the addition of China for consistency in following trends in the regions. - Mod.MPP]

Countries, territories, or areas outside China with reported laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths. Data as of [18 Mar 2020]; [numbers include both domestic and repatriated cases]

Grand total (including China and Diamond Princess): 209 839 (16 556) / 8778 (828)

Terms:
- Community transmission is evidenced by chains of transmission for a large number of cases, or by increasing positive tests through routine screening of samples.
- Local transmission indicates locations where the source of infection is within the reporting location.
- Imported cases only indicates locations where all cases have been acquired outside the location of reporting.
- Under investigation indicates locations where type of transmission has not been determined for any cases.
- Interrupted transmission indicates locations where interruption of transmission has been demonstrated (details to be determined).

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 outside China continues to grow and now totals 167. This includes 13 countries (including 2 territories) from the Western Pacific region, 58 countries (including 6 territories) from the European region, 8 from the Southeast Asia region, 19 countries (including 1 territory) from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 39 countries (including 10 territories) from the Americas region, and 30 countries (including 2 territories) from the African region.

Sobering information is the time it took to reach the 1st 100 000 cases (almost 3 months) and the time it took to reach the 2nd 100 000 cases - 12 days. Figure 2. Epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases reported outside of China, by date of report and WHO region through [18 Mar 2020], at the source URL above, is an excellent representation of the epidemic in China, juxtaposed with the increasing epidemics outside of China. One sees the contribution of the ongoing epidemics in Europe, and now the increasing cases in the Americas region, fueled by the USA but other countries are following suit.

A somewhat repetitive but necessary reminder: it is clear that the number of reported confirmed cases differs from different reporting websites and is somewhat a function of time of day the website is updated. For example, I note the time we've accessed the Worldometer website, but by the time the post is actually finished with the editing process, those numbers have at times significantly changed. Case counting is clearly a moving target, and, depending upon when the website updates, the numbers may be different. I try to start each post with the latest figures for the calendar day (the Hopkins table) and close with the figures from the start of the calendar day (the WHO tables), defining the calendar day as DST (now GMT-4). - Mod.MPP]
