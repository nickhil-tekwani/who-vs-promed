Commencing end November 2018, an epidemic of Rift valley fever (RVF) has been ongoing in Mayotte, a French overseas archipelago department in the Indian Ocean, to present. After a steady decline in cases during the last 3 weeks of March 2019, a new increase has been observed since early April. During the past week, 12 new foci of sick animals and 5 new human cases have been reported, for a total of 104 animal foci (including 82 bovines) and 122 human cases since the start of the event (20190420.6433086).

RVF had been circulating in Mayotte at least since early 2007, probably introduced there by the illegal importation of live infected ruminants from other Comoros islands (ref 2).

The economic activity of Mayotte (population, about 270 000), is based primarily on the agricultural sector, mainly fishing and livestock raising. Mayotte's livestock sector includes 4000 farms keeping 20 000 cattle and 15 000 small ruminants (2019 statistics, ref 1). The RVF losses to the livestock industry, caused by death, abortions, decreased production, veterinary treatment costs/medicines, movement restrictions, etc., are yet to be calculated.

The zoonotic impact of RVF is similarly deleterious. Infected humans suffer a serious sickness and complications. During the current event, their number is nearing 50 per 100 000 in Mayotte's general population, mainly in the rural section.

Given that domestic ruminants are involved in the epidemiological cycle and that humans mostly become infected after contact with viremic animals, the vaccination of ruminants, on top of protecting them, is the method of choice to prevent human disease.

Both live and inactivated vaccines are available for livestock. Live attenuated ("Smithburn") and inactivated vaccines are produced and commercially available in Egypt, South Africa, and Kenya. According to ref 2, "There is no Community pharmaceutical legislation prohibiting companies from producing RVF vaccines on EU territory and there is no obligation to notify such production to the European Commission." On the other hand, the French delegation, likely to be well aware of the need for animal vaccination in Mayotte, included the following comment in its presentation of 21 Mar 2019 (ref 1): "What about vaccination? - To date, no vaccine has been authorized in the EU."

According to ECDC's risk assessment, published 6 Mar 2019 (ref 3), the current outbreak in Mayotte poses a very low risk for EU/EEA countries. The interests of Mayotte's economy and farming industry, and of those in contact with the animals, may have been rendered less consideration.

According to the recent posting, Mayotte's farmers are being advised to "monitor and report promptly to veterinarians any abortions or stillbirths occurring in their animals or sick animals in order to take samples in search of the disease". No other measures are given for the protection of livestock.

Monitoring will not prevent additional cases of RVF in cattle, sheep, and goats and, most probably, humans. In the absence of vaccination, monitoring farmers (and, indeed, the public), veterinarians and others in the rural areas of Mayotte, might due to be exposed, time and again, to a serious health hazard.
