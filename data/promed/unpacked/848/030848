It's the food recall that just won't end. From the recall of a single batch of its “Diamond Naturals” dry dog food on 6 Apr 2012 for possible salmonella contamination, Diamond Pet Foods has expanded the recall on 8 separate occasions, endured a week-long inspection of one of its plants by the FDA, which criticized its practices, and most recently acknowledged that cats are also at risk.

Yet the Missouri-based maker of Diamond, Premium Edge, Kirkland Signature, and other pet food brands has not called special attention to the expansion of the recall to cat food beyond amending a statement on the company’s Internet recall site: “Diamond Pet Foods has voluntarily recalled some brands of dry dog and cat food that it manufactured in its Gaston, SC facility between 9 Dec 2011 and 7 Apr 2012 due to potential Salmonella contamination.”

On Friday morning, 18 May 2012, the Calgary Herald in Alberta, Canada, reported that 2 cats in a Montreal animal shelter have died, and another is ill, after eating Diamond Pet Foods products. Also in Quebec, another person has been reported with a case of salmonellosis, bringing the total number of cases to 16 in the USA and Canada caused apparently by handling the pet food.

Also on the same day, the company issued yet another recall involving certain sizes of its Diamond Naturals lamb and rice dog food manufactured on 26 Aug 2011, which is later than the date range for all its other recalled products so far. One of the unusual aspects of this recall is Diamond's release of information. On 12 Apr 2012, 6 days after Diamond's first recall, the FDA began an investigation. Its week-long inspection of Diamond's Gaston facility found numerous violations. “All reasonable precautions are not taken to ensure that production procedures to not contribute contamination from any source,” its report said, noting that the factory’s screening process for possible contaminants wasn’t thorough enough.

Other violations: Factory workers were seen handling sensitive equipment with bare hands; there weren't enough hand-washing stations throughout the plant (even in areas where raw meat was being handled); the factory used damaged equipment with holes and cuts, which would make the tools difficult to clean properly.

Despite these findings, the company didn't issue a 2nd recall until a week after the inspection was over, involving a single production run of its Chicken Soup for the Pet Lover's Soul brand. On 30 Apr 2012, it issued another expansion of the recall, this time involving puppy food. On 3 May 2012, the federal government announced it had linked 14 cases of salmonellosis in adults to Diamond's dog foods. On 4 May 2012, Natural Balance Pet Foods and WellPet LLC, makers of Wellness, announced a recall of their dog foods made at Diamond's plant. From there, the recalls kept coming.

“Diamond handled it the wrong way,” says Mike Sagman, creator and editor of dogfoodadviser.com, a consumer site that rates dog food products and follows pet-food industry news, including recalls. “The company knew more than they were letting out, and they let it dribble out over the month instead of releasing it all in one document. The damage is greater when you aren’t transparent.”

Recalls, he says, are unpredictable and largely unavoidable for large manufacturers in any industry. But they can be an opportunity for a company to shine, he adds, in terms of responding to a problem and coming clean with customers. But “Diamond really blew it,” he says. “Their chance of survival from this is questionable, my common sense tells me.”

The company itself didn't return multiple calls to its media line. Its consumer hotline was answered promptly, but on two separate occasions its operators declined to provide any information once the caller identified herself as a reporter.

The FDA is also tight-lipped.

“The investigation is open and pending so we are limited in the information we can release to the public,” FDA spokeswoman Laura Alvey wrote via e-mail. “Diamond voluntarily shut down their facility to clean (including the 2 lines where the contaminated product was made) and to implement additional procedures.”

What does all of this mean for consumers? Below is the most updated information on the recall, which now includes cat food:

Affected brands manufactured by Diamond Pet Foods are:
-Chicken Soup for the Pet Lover’s Soul
-Country Value
-Diamond
-Diamond Naturals
-Premium Edge

[2] Human, canine cases - USA, Canada
Date: Wed 16 May 2012
Source: eFoodAlert [edited]
http://efoodalert.net/2012/05/16/salmonella-confirmed-in-two-dogs-fed-recalled-pet-food/


At last report (11 May 2012), there are 15 outbreak-related confirmed human cases of _Salmonella_ Infantis infections in the USA and 1 Canadian case. 5 people have been hospitalized.

2 dogs can be added to the list of clinically confirmed infections in the Diamond Pet Foods _Salmonella_ Infantis outbreak, according to FDA’s Laura Alvey, Deputy Director, Communications Staff at the agency’s Center for Veterinary Medicine. Both dogs lived in the same house as an outbreak victim, and were fed one of the recalled dry dog food products.
Outbreak cases have occurred in 9 states, including Alabama (1), Connecticut (1), Michigan (1), Missouri (3), North Carolina (3), New Jersey (1), Ohio (2), Pennsylvania (2), and Virginia (1). The Canadian outbreak victim is from the Province of Quebec. Once the outbreak investigation confirmed a link between the illnesses and samples of dry dog food manufactured in Diamond Pet Foods’ Gaston (South Carolina) production plant, the company voluntarily shut down the facility “to clean and implement additional procedures,” according to Alvey.

The investigation is still “open and pending,” Alvey added in her email to me earlier today, which limits the information that FDA can release to the public at this time. One important piece of missing information is the scope of international distribution of the recalled pet food products. So far, Diamond Pet Foods has not responded to my email request for a list of affected countries outside of the USA and Canada.

[3] International distribution
Date: Sat 19 May 2012

http://efoodalert.net/2012/05/19/tracking-international-distribution-of-diamond-pet-foods-products/

One of the most important unanswered questions regarding the Diamond Pet Foods recalls is where in the world – other than the USA, Puerto Rico and Canada – these products were sold. As far as FDA is concerned, it is the responsibility of the manufacturer to provide this information – FDA’s authority stops at the borders of the USA and its territories.

Information provided by eFoodAlert readers has established that recalled Taste of the Wild pet food was distributed in both France and Ireland. What else can we deduce, in the absence of any substantive information from the manufacturer (who, by the way, has not replied to my call to the company’s Media Contact telephone number)?

The Taste of the Wild web site is revealing. The Distributor Locator page lists more than 50 countries – in addition to the USA and Canada – where Taste of the Wild is distributed. In most cases, the name of the distributor is given, together with contact information (address and telephone number).

My correspondent in Ireland reported having purchased a recalled lot of Taste of the Wild from Zooplus.ie, a company with headquarters in Germany. Zooplus describes itself as “Europe’s leading and largest online pet supplies retailer,” with a presence across 18 European countries, some of which do not appear on the Taste of the Wild Distributor Locator web page.

While there is no way of confirming (at least until Diamond Pet Foods or FDA releases the overseas distribution information) that a recalled batch of pet food was available for sale in each of the listed countries, consumers in the following countries should pay special attention to the production code and “Best by date” information on the packages of Taste of the Wild dry dog and cat food that they are offering to their pets. Where available, this list indicates the name of the distributor, or retailer where recalled pet food may have been sold.
