--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Citrus viroids are associated with decline in citrus production. Thus, the presence of citrus viroids and their spread needs to be investigated to facilitate the management of these pathogens in orchards. The authors, during a limited survey, collected citrus samples from citrus growing areas of Malaysia to detect viroids.

Abstract
--------
A 328 nucleotide variant of _Citrus bent leaf viroid_ (CBLVd) was characterized from citrus varieties showing leaf bending, stunting and midvein necrosis. CBLVd was detected by RT-PCR assay using CBLVd specific primers in 12 out of 90 samples, collected from 6 different areas. The viroid was present in 5 species of citrus namely _Citrofortunella microcarpa_, _Citrus aurantifolia_, _C. hystrix_, _C. maxima_, and _C. sinensis_. Sequence analysis of the isolates obtained from this study showed 99-100% sequence identity to [the] CBLVd Jp isolate.

Inoculation of sap obtained from a CBLVd positive _C. aurantifolia_ into 6 months old _C. microcarpa_ seedlings [led to] symptoms of leaf bending, reduced leaf size of matured leaves and mild mosaic between 4 to 6 months after inoculation. The presence of CBLVd in the inoculated seedlings was confirmed by RT-PCR assay and sequencing.

[_Citrus bent leaf viroid_ (CBLVd) belongs to the genus _Apscaviroid_ (type member _Apple scar skin viroid_). The genus also includes _Citrus dwarfing viroid_ (CDVd; previously citrus viroid III), _Citrus viroid V_ (CVd-V), _Citrus viroid VI_ and a proposed new species citrus viroid VII.

Many citrus viroids, especially apscaviroids, do not induce easily recognisable symptoms in citrus varieties used commercially (as scions or rootstocks), but may cause reduction in tree size and yield. Systematic surveys and quarantine measures are needed to protect crops from these pathogens. Pathogenic effects may be compounded when several viroids are present (synergism). CBLVd was shown to have strong synergistic effects in co-infection with CVd-V or CDVd, leading to stronger leaf symptoms and very pronounced dwarfing.

Viroids are exceptionally stable and can survive in plant sap or leaf litter for considerable times. Citrus viroids are transmitted by grafting and mechanical means and are widespread in citrus that has been propagated from symptomless viroid-infected budwood. Disease management may include removal of infected plants and other possible sources of inoculum, but the use of viroid-free rootstock and grafting material is essential. Dramatic yield increases are frequently observed in viroid-free citrus cultivars. In some instances, however, deliberate infection with viroids may be used as a dwarfing agent.

Molecular sequences of CBLVd were reported from Malaysia earlier (see link below), but the inoculation studies above have now confirmed the presence of infectious viroid (modified Koch's postulates) that is biologically active and thus a potential threat to national citrus crops.
