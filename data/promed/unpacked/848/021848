Mexico restricts imports of birds and poultry products from 6 US states
-------------------------------------------------
Mexico has banned all imports of birds and poultry, and their byproducts,
such as meat and eggs, originating from California and Nevada. The measure
will remain in place until both states are able to certify that Newcastle
disease (ND) has been eradicated from their territories.
In an attempt to minimize the risk, the Mexican government has also placed
restrictions on imports from the 4 neighboring states: Oregon, Idaho, Utah,
and Arizona.
In addition to these measures, the points of entry into Mexico will be
reduced from 16 to 5. Birds and poultry and their byproducts will only be
admitted into the country by customs offices in Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas;
Colombia, Nuevo Leon; Reynosa, Tamaulipas; Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua; and
Nogales, Sonora.
In spite of its efforts, the United States government has been unable to
control the outbreak of ND affecting its poultry industry. As a result,
animal health authorities in both Mexico and the United States conducted a
joint preliminary analysis of the risk that imported birds and poultry
products from the United States disseminate the Newcastle virus that is
affecting the industry in California and Nevada.
During the course of the next 2 weeks, the documentation provided by the
United States animal health authorities regarding the measures taken to
prevent the spread of the disease to other states will be analyzed and field
visits will be scheduled to verify the information presented. Once the
process is complete, a decision will be made on whether these 4 states will
recover access to the Mexican market, or will be ratified as posing a risk
to Mexico.
The status of the other 44 American states regarding access to the Mexican
market will remain unchanged.
In order to take definitive measures concerning this case, technicians from
the Mexican National Animal Health and Food Quality Control Service will
continue to analyze all existing and new data, and will participate in the
field visits to California and Nevada.

[It is understandable for the Mexican government to seek to protect its own
poultry industry. It is interesting that the strains circulating in
northern Mexico appear to be closely related to strains found in Nevada (see
second ref. below), but that relationship does not necessarily indicate that
the origin of the virus was Mexico. - Mod.TG]
