Tainted food was concluded to be the culprit in the hospitalization of nearly 1000 workers at a South Korean-owned garment company in the Mekong Delta Province of Tien Giang last week. Dan Tri online newspaper quoted the Vietnam Food Administration as saying on Thu 10 Oct 2013, that salmonella -- a bacterium often causing food poisoning in humans -- was found in some of the food samples taken from lunch served at Wondo Vina Company last Thu 3 Oct 2013.

Wondo Vina workers started having symptoms like stomach-ache, vomiting, headache, diarrhea, and fever around midnight Thu 3 Oct 2013, and the next morning 968 of them were admitted to Cho Gao District's general hospital, including 171 in serious condition. A team of health workers was sent to the company to check and treat another 150 workers who had slight symptoms. Half the patients were discharged later that same day, and no fatality has been reported so far.

After the outbreak, authorities closed the company's canteen, where the lunch was cooked by Hoa Lan Company of HCMC [Ho Chi Minh City], for 5 days, to clean and disinfect it.
