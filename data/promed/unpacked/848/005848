It appears to be a late season for influenza type A in Seattle/King Countyâ€¦....most hospital staff had been immunised.

As I have been saying for several years, the duration of (currently configured) Flu Vax immunity may be too short to carry through an extended flu season, especially if people get vaccinated early. While a stronger formulation for Seniors is available, thought should be given (admittedly, cost consideration is major) to a hypothetical 2-dose regimen.

Unfortunately, the report does not mention the time interval between immunization and onset of illness.

"Vaccination with vaccines recommended for all adults or for those in specific age groups is generally cost-effective, if not cost-saving, for society. The National Commission on Prevention Priorities (NCPP) ranked clinical preventive services based on clinically preventable disease effects and cost-effectiveness. In the NCPP report, influenza vaccination for adults aged 50 years and older and pneumococcal vaccination for adults aged 65 years and older ranked high, with 8 of 10 possible points in the scoring system used. Most other studies have found influenza vaccination reduces or minimizes health care, societal, and individual costs or the productivity losses and absenteeism associated with influenza illness. Economic analyses among adults aged 65 years and older have found influenza vaccination to be cost-effective." - Mod.CP]
