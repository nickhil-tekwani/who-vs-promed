[According to the OIE WAHID database, since the beginning of 2009, the
following countries in Europe have identified the disease: Belgium, Czech
Republic, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands. Slovenia, Sweden,
and United Kingdom. So, it is not surprising that Portugal has also now
identified a case as this disease is inherently difficult to control and
has the potential to devastate reproductive programs on horse farms. See
ProMED-mail posting: Contagious equine metritis - USA (04): (TX)
20090116.0178 for details.
