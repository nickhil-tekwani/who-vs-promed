The Washington State Veterinarian's Office has quarantined a King County facility after a horse tested positive for non-neuropathogenic EHV-1.

The Washington State Veterinarian's Office has received a report of a case of non-neuropathogenic equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1) in a King County horse, the Equine Disease Communication Center (EDCC) reported on 13 Jun 2018.

"The horse is in isolation, and the facility is currently under quarantine," the EDCC said. "Strict equine biosecurity is in place."

Earlier this year [2018], several other facilities in King County were quarantined after resident horses tested positive for EHV-1. Those quarantines have since been released.

Herpesvirus is highly contagious among horses and can cause a variety of ailments in equids, including rhinopneumonitis (a respiratory disease usually found in young horses), abortion in broodmares, and myeloencephalopathy (the neurologic form). In many horses, fever is the only sign of EHV-1 infection, which can go undetected.

In addition to fever, other common signs of EHV-1 infection in young horses include cough, decreased appetite, depression, and a nasal discharge. Pregnant mares typically show no signs of infection before they abort, and abortions usually occur late in gestation (around 8 months) but can be earlier. Abortions can occur anywhere from 2 weeks to several months following infection with EHV-1.

Horses with the neurologic form usually have a fever at the onset of the disease and might show signs of a respiratory infection.

[Let us hope this animal recovers, as this is the non-neuropathic form. This is another disease, especially the neuropathic form, for which we are severely lacking in adequate treatment and prevention. - Mod.TG
