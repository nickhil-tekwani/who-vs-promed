Update 6 on SARS cases in Singapore
-----------------------------------
As of 19 Mar 2003, a total of 31 people with SARS have been reported. All
are in hospital, except for 2 patients who have since recovered and been
discharged. These 2 patients were the initial cohort who had travelled to
Hong Kong. All the patients are stable except for 4 patients who are in
serious condition.
The 8 additional patients reported today comprise 3 family members and
friends of patients, and 5 hospital staff who had attended to the patients.
Apart from the 3 initial people who had travelled to Hong Kong, a total of
15 family and friends of cases, and 13 hospital staff have been diagnosed
with SARS. So far, all the cases of SARS have been linked to the initial 3
cases. No new index cases have been reported. In addition, no further cases
have occurred among health care workers after the implementation of
enhanced infection control precautions.
Preliminary investigations by the Pathology Department at the Singapore
General Hospital and the Defence Medical Research Institute have identified
the likely infective agent to belong to the paramyxovirus family. This
corroborates early investigation results by overseas centers in Germany and
Hong Kong.
The Ministry of Health would like to appeal to the public to avoid travel
to Hong Kong, Hanoi and Guangdong province in China for the time being,
unless absolutely necessary. This would help us greatly in our efforts to
contain the number of new cases.
We also advise you to stay calm and continue with your daily routine.
Though SARS is infectious, there is no need for alarm as your risk to SARS
is low. WHO has reported that the disease is spread from person to person
but only through close contact with an infected person. There is no
evidence to date that the disease spreads through casual contact.
The Ministry would like to reiterate that you should seek immediate medical
attention if you have:
- Fever (more than 38 degrees Celsius) and respiratory symptoms including
cough, shortness of breath, or breathing difficulty;
AND
- have travelled to Hong Kong, Hanoi or Guangdong province in China, within
2 weeks of onset of the symptoms; or
- are a close contact of persons diagnosed with SARS. (Close contact means
having cared for, having lived with, or having had direct contact with
respiratory secretions and body fluids of a person with SARS)

It is possible for the status of a reported case to change over time. SARS
is a diagnosis of exclusion. This means that whenever a known cause is
found that could fully account for a patient's clinical condition, this
patient should no longer be considered to be a case of SARS.
+The Chinese authorities have reported suspect and probable cases in
Guangdong province. Figures are being updated.
* No documented secondary transmission in-country. No affected areas.
**One death attributed to Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China
occurred in a case medically transferred from Viet Nam.

Source of pneumonia cases found
-------------------------------
Due to its ongoing investigation, the Department of Health (DH) confirmed
that a total of 7 people who had contracted atypical pneumonia recently had
stayed in or visited a hotel in Kowloon last month (February 2003).
Speaking at a press conference today (19 Mar 2003), the director of health,
Dr Margaret Chan, said the 7 people comprised 3 visitors from Singapore, 2
from Canada, one Mainland visitor, and a local [Hong Kong, SAR] resident.
DH's epidemiological investigations revealed that the 7 visitors stayed on
the same floor of the hotel between 12 Feb 2003 and 2 Mar 2003. They
developed pneumonia symptoms between 15 and 27 Feb 2003. The local
resident, who has been identified as the index patient in the outbreak of
Prince of Wales Hospital, had visited his friend staying in the hotel from
15 to 23 Feb 2003. One patient, who became sick one week before staying at
the hotel, is believed to be the source of the infection.
Dr Chan stressed that there is no cause for panic among the hotel staff and
visitors staying in the hotel as well as residents living in the area as no
other new cases have been detected since end of February 2003.
"Investigations showed that the general environmental condition of the
hotel is good and that hotel staff had not reported any sickness related to
the outbreak. The department considered that the source of the virus has
now been removed from the hotel. We believe there is no residual risk for
residents in the hotel. We believe that the transmission of the virus is by
close contact and should have been transient. There is no evidence of
active disease currently occurring in the hotel," Dr Chan said.
On the request of DH, the hotel management has isolated the whole floor for
thorough cleansing and disinfection as precautionary measures. "The floor
will be re-opened upon DH's satisfaction with the process. Health advice
will be given to the hotel staff and DH will keep close medical
surveillance of them," Dr Chan said.
DH has set up a hotline (2961 8968) to provide health advice on the
prevention of upper respiratory track infection. It will be manned by DH
staff up to 1 am tomorrow (20 Mar 2003) and from 8 am to 5 pm from Monday
to Friday and between 9 am to 1 pm on Saturday.

(submitted and translated by Dr Tim Foggin; family doctor, working at
Worldlink Medical Centers in Shanghai, China <foggin@canada.com>)
Health officials assured residents yesterday that no cases of the disease
have been reported in Shanghai as yet.

<http://www.cnn.com/2003/HEALTH/03/19/mystery.disease.virus/index.html>
A swathe of countries across the world -- among them Singapore, Canada,
Taiwan, Australia, Britain, Brunei, Canada, Spain, and the United States --
have reported suspected cases of the disease.
On Wednesday the mystery virus appeared to have jumped to China's capital
Beijing, as well as to Japan, Romania, Belgium, Finland and France.

The information from Hong Kong in [4] Index cluster contact, Hong Kong -
MOH above is very interesting. It appears as though they may have
identified the first contact exposure with an ill person visiting Hong
Kong, SAR from an unspecified country. The index cases from Hong Kong SAR,
Canada and Singapore were all present and residents (or in the case of the
Hong Kong contact a visitor to a guest) of the same floor of the same hotel
during the same period as the presumed index case introduced SARS to Hong
Kong. The report does not mention if all of the above mentioned
individuals/cases knew each other personally, but it does mention "we
believe that the transmission of the virus is by close contact and should
have been transient. There is no evidence of active disease currently
occurring in the hotel". Before one draws any conclusions on the
information given in the press release on the transmission of this disease,
it is important to mention that information on the denominator at risk (the
number of people staying on that floor of the hotel during that period) was
not mentioned in the report. Other denominator data that will be of
interest are the total number of guests and employees who were present in
the hotel during the identified time frame. If no additional cases are
identified among the general "population" at the hotel during the time
frame (guests and employees present in the hotel during the same period of
time), it does further suggest that a closer contact is necessary for
transmission of this disease. It would be interesting to learn from what
part of Mainland China the above mentioned guest was from. According to the
WHO statistics (see [3] above), China has confirmed there have been cases
of SARS in Guangdong, but the exact number of cases and deaths identified
is still under review.
New information has become available each day since this outbreak was first
identified, and will probably continue to do so on a daily basis as more
information is available from ongoing epidemiologic and laboratory
investigations. - Mod.MPP]
