Botulism cases in Alicante and Germany linked to brand of dried salted fish
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Two cases of botulism in the Spanish province of Alicante and another in Germany linked to a brand of dried salted fish produced in The Netherlands has led to it being withdrawn from sale in various parts of Spain.

Salted roach (_Rutilus rutilus_, known in Spanish and branded as such in supermarkets as rutilo), stocked in refrigeration cabinets and bearing the identification number NL-6114-EG, distributed by Monolith Alimentos España Sur (in Valencia) and Norte (in Catalunya) has been taken off the shelves after 2 consumers in the province of Alicante reported having been apparently affected by the intoxication. Both showed 'very similar symptoms', although it has yet to be confirmed whether they caught botulism from eating dried roach.

All supermarkets and delicatessens in the towns of Dénia, Altea, La Nucia, Torrevieja, Benidorm, Orihuela and Alicante city have taken it off the shelves, as have those in the province of Castellón, Gandia (Valencia province) and Valencia city. In Catalunya, shops in Barcelona, Badalona and Sabadell (Barcelona province), Salou (Tarragona province) and Lleida have withdrawn it from sale.

The Spanish Consumer, Food Safety and Nutrition Agency (AECOSAN), part of the ministry of health, says it has received a European alert after a case of botulism in Germany thought to have been caused by the same product.

[Many of the botulism risks related to salted, cured fish are a result of the fish not being adequately eviscerated. The viscera of the fish are the parts most likely to be contaminated. Although not stated, most cases of botulism associated with the aquatic environment are serotype E whereas most other cases in humans are either type A or B. - Mod.LL
