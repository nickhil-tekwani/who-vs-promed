Mexican authorities say a mass die-off of fish at a lake in western Mexico was not due to natural causes. Over 33 metric tons of rotting dead fish have been removed from Lake Cajititlan in Jalisco state. The cause of the die-off has not been determined, but the state environment department said late Sunday [31 Aug 2014] that it was not due to natural causes.

Workers using shovels, a bulldozer, boats, and wheel barrels removed the dead fish, which are being sent for testing. The small, finger-sized fish are apparently a type of chub.

It was the 4th time this year [2014] there has been a die-off at the shallow lake, which sits between Guadalajara and Lake Chapala. Some had speculated that abrupt changes in temperature or oxygen levels may have been responsible for earlier incidents.
