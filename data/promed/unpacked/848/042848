The massive murre die-off that left tens of thousands of dead birds on Alaska's coast in 2015 and 2016 may be over, but the population is still struggling. In the Gulf of Alaska and Bering Sea, surviving murres are failing to reproduce.

"When we got to most of the breeding colonies last summer [2016] we found that very few birds were attending the cliffs and almost complete reproductive failure at most of the colonies we looked at," said Heather Renner, a biologist for the Alaska Maritime Wildlife Refuge. That means in some places less than 1 percent of the chicks survived.

While reproductive failure is common for some species like black-legged kittiwakes, it isn't for murres. With 30 plus years of monitoring data, Renner says they've never seen anything like this. Still, she says 1 year of reproductive failure doesn't necessarily mean the species is doing poorly.

It's important to study murres because they're a sign of ecosystem health. Renner calls them sentinels of change. "They tell us something about what's happening underwater," Renner said. "So seabirds are great indicators to us of things that are taking place in other parts of the ocean."

Renner says it's too early to tell if the reproductive failure will continue into this summer's [2017] breeding season.

[The common murre (_Uria aalge_) is a large auk. It occurs in low-Arctic and boreal waters in the North-Atlantic and North Pacific. It spends most of its time at sea, only coming to land to breed on rocky cliff shores or islands. They nest in densely packed colonies.

Large die-offs of this species linked to strong "El Niño" events have been reported in the past. In 1993, after a prolonged series of high temperature anomalies in the Tropical Pacific, thousands of murres were found dead with signs of emaciation in the Gulf of Alaska (Marine Pollution Bulletin 34: 656-662). Food supplies may have been affected by the high temperatures observed during the last months of 2015 in the Pacific Ocean.

In the previous mass die-off event, an unusually and unprecedented prolonged "El Niño" event, with anomalously warm water temperatures (+ 1 to 4 deg C; approx. 34 to 39 deg F) persisted in the northeast Pacific from California to Alaska during the winter of 1992-1993 and spring of 1993.

Previous information about this episode suggests starvation as the main cause of the die-off that left this population in such a poor state. If climate change affects the "El Niño" Southern Oscillation resulting in frequent warm water anomalies, the ecosystems of America might suffer dramatic disruptions like this one. - Mod.PMB
