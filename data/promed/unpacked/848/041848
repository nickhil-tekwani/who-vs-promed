An outbreak of chikungunya in the Caribbean region was reported from the French part of the island of St Martin on 5 Dec 2013. This is the 1st time that autochthonous transmission of the virus has been documented in the Americas.

An ECDC risk assessment of the outbreak published on 12 Dec [2013] concluded that the risk of the disease spreading to other islands in the region is high. Since then, new chikungunya cases have been reported from several islands in the Caribbean.

As of 9 Jan 2014, the following numbers of cases have been reported:
- 201 probable or confirmed cases in St Martin (FR);
- 2 confirmed cases in St Maarten (NL);
- 48 probable or confirmed cases in Martinique;
- 25 probable or confirmed cases in St Barthelemy;
- 10 probable or confirmed cases including one imported case from St Martin in Guadeloupe;
- 1 confirmed case imported from Martinique in French Guiana.

Chikungunya transmission was detected during an ongoing dengue outbreak in the Caribbean. Dengue and chikungunya viruses are transmitted by the same _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito species. The naive population, the presence of an effective vector in the region, and the movement of people in and between islands are factors that make it likely the outbreak will continue to spread geographically and increase in numbers. Since the dengue outbreak is ongoing, clinicians and travel medicine clinics should remain vigilant regarding imported dengue and chikungunya cases from the Caribbean.

[Intensive surveillance of chikungunya virus infections continues on the affected Caribbean islands, and the number of confirmed, probable, and suspected cases slowly increases. Although not mentioned in the report above, an active vector control effort is underway. A 10 Jan 2014 press report does mention vector control efforts. That same report also indicates that there are now 50 confirmed cases of chikungunya virus infection on Martinique (http://www.martinique.franceantilles.fr/actualite/sante/une-epidemie-ineluctable-qu-il-faut-maitriser-236999.php, in French).
