Walkerton, Ontario hit with _E. coli_ again
-------------------------------------------
TORONTO: Health authorities say that the same lethal strain of _Escherichia
coli_ that killed 7 people in Walkerton [2 years ago - Mod.LL] is probably
behind the latest outbreak that has left 5 children ill. That strain
(O157:H7) can cause kidney failure and other major health problems.
Testing at the public health laboratory in Toronto has [confirmed] O157:H7
infection in one of the children being looked after by a babysitter at a
local home. Tests on the other children, all under the age of 5 years, are
continuing.
The town's water is not to blame for the latest outbreak, which has
remained confined to the children attending the daycare facility. There's
no word on the exact cause but undercooked meat is suspected. Tainted tap
water killed 7 people and sickened 2300 people in Walkerton about 2 years ago.

[The localized presumed cluster of _E. coli_ O157:H7 is unlikely to be
related to the contaminated water source that accounted for the large
outbreak in Walkerton, Ontario 2 years ago. Although undercooked ground
beef is a common source, various other vehicles that are directly or
indirectly contaminated (for instance, unpasteurized apple juice made from
apples collected in a cow pasture) may be implicated. It is unclear at this
point whether all 5 were infected in the day care center or, probably more
likely, the infection was brought in by one child and spread to the others.
The 2000 outbreak on Walkerton was discussed in the last 2 ProMED-mail
postings referenced below. - Mod.LL]
