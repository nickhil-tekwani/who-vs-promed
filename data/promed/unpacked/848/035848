[Case count information as of 9 pm EDT, 28 Jul 2008]
CDC is collaborating with public health officials in many states, the
Indian Health Service, and the FDA (US Food & Drug Administration) to
investigate an ongoing multi-state outbreak of human _Salmonella_
[enterica_] serotype Saintpaul infections. An initial epidemiologic
investigation in New Mexico and Texas comparing foods eaten by
persons who were ill in May 2008 to foods eaten by well persons
identified consumption of raw tomatoes as strongly linked to illness.
A similar but much larger, nationwide study comparing persons who
were ill in June 2008 to well persons found that ill persons were
more likely to have recently consumed raw tomatoes, fresh jalapeno
peppers, and fresh cilantro. These items were commonly, though not
always, consumed together, so that study could not determine which
item(s) caused the illnesses.

Recently, many clusters of illnesses have been identified in several
states among persons who ate at restaurants. Most clusters involve
fewer than 5 ill persons. Three larger clusters have been intensively
investigated. In one, illnesses were linked to consumption of an item
containing fresh tomatoes and fresh jalapeno peppers. In the other 2,
illnesses were linked to an item containing fresh jalapeno peppers
and no other of the suspect items. Other clusters are under active
investigation. The accumulated data from all investigations indicate
that jalapeno peppers are likely to be a major cause of this
outbreak. Fresh serrano peppers, and fresh tomatoes remain under
investigation. Investigators from many agencies are collaborating to
track the source of the implicated peppers and other produce items.

An FDA laboratory detected _S._ Saintpaul with the outbreak strain
fingerprint pattern in a sample of jalapeno pepper obtained from a
distribution center in McAllen, Texas. The distributor is working
with FDA to recall the contaminated product in the United States. The
peppers were grown in Mexico; investigators are working to determine
where they were contaminated.

The Laboratory Services Division of the Colorado Department of Public
Health and Environment detected _S._ Saintpaul with the outbreak
strain fingerprint pattern in a jalapeno pepper provided by an ill
individual. The state health department is working with the FDA to
determine the origin of the jalapeno pepper.

Since April 2008, 1307 persons infected with _S._ Saintpaul with the
same genetic fingerprint have been identified in 43 states, the
District of Columbia, and Canada. These were identified because
clinical laboratories in all states send strains from ill persons to
their State public health laboratory for characterization. The number
of ill persons identified in each state is as follows: Alabama (3
persons), Arkansas (19), Arizona (56), California (11), Colorado
(16), Connecticut (5), Florida (3), Georgia (40), Idaho (6), Illinois
(115), Indiana (20), Iowa (2), Kansas (21), Kentucky (2), Louisiana
(2), Maine (1), Maryland (38), Massachusetts (29), Michigan (26),
Minnesota (22), Mississippi (2), Missouri (20), Montana (1), New
Hampshire (5), Nevada (13), New Jersey (16), New Mexico (106), New
York (39), North Carolina (28), Ohio (10), Oklahoma (25), Oregon
(11), Pennsylvania (13), Rhode Island (3), South Carolina (2),
Tennessee (9), Texas (495), Utah (2), Virginia (31), Vermont (2),
Washington (17), West Virginia (1), Wisconsin (13), and the District
of Columbia (1). Five ill persons are reported from Canada; 4 appear
to have been infected while traveling in the USA, the travel status
of the 5th ill person is unknown.

Among the 1269 persons with information available, illnesses began
between 10 Apr 2008 and 13 Jul 2008, including 38 who became ill on 1
Jul 2008 or later. These numbers include those with estimated onset
dates as well as those with reported onset dates. The latest reported
onset date is 12 Jul 2008. Patients range in age from less than 1 to
99 years; 50 percent are female. The rate of illness is highest among
persons 20 to 29 years old; the rate of illness is lowest in children
10 to 19 years old and in persons 80 or more years old. At least 253
persons were hospitalized.

The outbreak can be visually described with a chart showing the
number of persons who became ill each day. This chart is called an
epidemic curve or epi curve. [Maps of the outbreak and the epi curve
can be found at the source URL. - Mod.LL] It shows that the number of
persons who became ill peaked during May 2008 and decreased in June
2008. The average number of persons who became ill between 20 May
2008 and 10 Jun 2008 was 33 per day. The average number of persons
who became ill between 11 and 20 Jun 2008 was 19 per day. The
outbreak appears to be ongoing, but with fewer new illnesses reported
each day.

[2] Colorado: smoking jalapeno

Colorado health officials said they had found a _Salmonella_-tainted
jalapeno in the home of someone sickened in a recent outbreak of the
food poisoning, a vital clue in tracking down the source of the
illness.

The pepper carried bacteria with the same unusual strain of _S._
Saintpaul that has made 1307 people sick in the USA, the state health
department said.

"The pepper was purchased at a local Wal-Mart, likely on 24 Jun 2008,
and the individual became ill on 4 Jul 2008. This is the 1st pepper
linked directly to an ill person in this outbreak," the health
department said in a statement posted on its website this week.

On Friday [25 Jul 2008], USA health officials said they had traced
the outbreak to jalapeno peppers from Mexico. The only other tainted
pepper was found last week at a distribution facility in McAllen,
Texas. The Food and Drug Administration has said peppers grown in the
USA are not involved in the outbreak.
