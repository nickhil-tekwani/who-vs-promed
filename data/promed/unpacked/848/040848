In the ProMED-mail note posted on 13 May 2006 [see: Rabies, human - USA
(TX) 20060513.1360] about the tragic rabies death of the young man in
Texas, suspected to have been the result of contact with a bat that
occurred in his bedroom, the editorial note gave good advice about seeking
medical attention following contact with a bat. It may be important to add
one more piece of advice for the public regarding these types of encounters
with bats -- in this case, as it often is, the bat was captured, but
instead of being retained for testing, the animal was reportedly released.
If this bat was indeed the source of this infection, it would have been
found to be rabid, and rabies PEP [post-exposure prophylaxis] would have
been promptly initiated, virtually assuredly preventing infection with this
fatal disease. Thus, an important further message for us to convey to the
public is to try to capture and retain for possible testing those bats
involved with encounters that include known contacts, or encounters where
contact was likely to go undetected.
The 1999 ACIP [Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices] recommendation
on Human Rabies Prevention (which I believe is presently being updated)
specifies that: "In all instances of potential human exposures involving
bats, the bat in question should be safely collected, if possible, and
submitted for rabies diagnosis."
In many instances a prompt review of the circumstances with the public
health agency will determine that circumstances do not reveal the
probability of a contact, and the bat may not need to be examined. Even
when testing is required, because rabies is detected in a small percentage
of bats encountered under these circumstances (varies from state-to-state,
but 2-4 per cent annually in New York State), PEP is determined not to be
necessary in most instances, preventing unnecessary treatment and sparing
wasteful use of scarce and expensive biologics. However, testing will help
assure that PEP will be administered in the few instances where it is so
essential to prevent recurrence of these relatively uncommon, but repeating
tragic scenarios. Of course, capture methods ideally should employ
protection to avoid further direct contact with the bat -- our usual advice
includes the use of heavy work gloves and containers such as coffee cans
whenever possible.
