Gonorrhoea could become an untreatable disease, England's chief medical officer has warned. Dame Sally Davies has written to all GPs and pharmacies to ensure they are prescribing the correct drugs after the rise of "super-gonorrhoea" in Leeds. Her warning comes after concerns were raised that some patients were not getting both of the antibiotics needed to clear the infection.

Sexual health doctors said gonorrhoea was "rapidly" developing resistance. A highly drug-resistant strain of gonorrhoea was detected in the north of England in March [2015]. [See ProMED-mail post Gonococcal disease - UK: azithromycin resistance, RFI 20150919.3656467.] That strain is able to shrug off the antibiotic azithromycin, which is normally used alongside another drug, ceftriaxone.

In her letter, the chief medical officer said: "Gonorrhoea is at risk of becoming an untreatable disease due to the continuing emergence of antimicrobial resistance."

But while an injection of ceftriaxone and an azithromycin pill are supposed to be used in combination, this may not always be the case for all patients. Early in 2015, the British Association for Sexual Health and HIV (BASHH) warned that some online pharmacies were offering only oral medication. Using just 1 of the 2 drugs makes it easier for the bacterium to develop resistance.

The letter, which is also signed by chief pharmaceutical officer Dr Keith Ridge, stated: "Gonorrhoea has rapidly acquired resistance to new antibiotics, leaving few alternatives to the current recommendations. It is therefore extremely important that suboptimal treatment does not occur."

The disease is caused by the bacterium called _Neisseria gonorrhoeae_. The infection is spread by unprotected vaginal, oral and anal sex. Symptoms can include a thick green or yellow discharge from sexual organs, pain when urinating and bleeding between periods. Often the person has no symptoms, however, but can still easily spread the disease to others. Untreated infection can lead to infertility, pelvic inflammatory disease and can be passed on to a child during pregnancy.

Gonorrhoea is the 2nd most common sexually transmitted infection in England and cases are soaring. The number of infections increased by 19 percent from 29 419 in 2013 to 34 958 in 2014. Dr Jan Clarke, the president of BASHH, told the BBC News website: "We're really pleased that the chief medical officer has stressed that gonorrhoea needs this approach to treatment due to the rapid development of resistance. We need to protect what we've got and we need to encourage pharmacists and general practitioners to follow first-line treatment."

Dr Andrew Lee, from Public Health England, added: "Investigations are ongoing into a number of cases of anti-microbial resistant gonorrhoea. Public Health England will continue to monitor, and act on, the spread of antimicrobial resistance and potential gonorrhoea treatment failures, to make sure they are identified and managed promptly."

[ProMED-mail recently posted a report of 12 cases of gonococcal disease due to a strain that was highly resistant to azithromycin in Leeds and an additional 4 cases have been reported in Macclesfield, Oldham and Scunthorpe in northern England (Gonococcal disease - UK: azithromycin resistance, RFI 20150919.3656467). All cases were in heterosexuals. However, we were not told in that report the strains' minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of azithromycin or other antibiotics; whether all the strains had a matching genotype; the medical histories (e.g., prior recent antibiotic exposure) and epidemiological links of the affected individuals; or how the individuals were successfully treated.

Because of the experience with other microbes that have developed antimicrobial resistance, combination therapy using 2 antimicrobials with different mechanisms of action (i.e., ceftriaxone intramuscularly plus azithromycin orally as a single dose of each) has been recommended in the U.S. and the UK to improve treatment efficacy and potentially delay emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistance. A single 2g dose of azithromycin has been used effectively to treat genitourinary infections caused by susceptible _N. gonorrhoeae_ (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6018a2.htm), but azithromycin monotherapy is not recommended for routine treatment of gonorrhea because of concerns regarding emerging resistance to azithromycin (http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/760301).

We are now told in the above news report that some online pharmacies were offering only the oral azithromycin, rather that the recommended combination of intramuscular ceftriaxone plus oral azithromycin. We are not told if azithromycin alone was used in Leeds and other communities in Northern England where azithromycin resistance has emerged, if oral azithromycin alone was used in the 16 cases of azithromycin-resistant gonorrhea in Leeds, Macclesfield, Oldham and Scunthorpe, or the dose of azithromycin that was used alone (e.g., 1 or 2 g). More information would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.ML]
