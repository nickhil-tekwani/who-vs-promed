Humans aren't the only ones suffering from the flu this year [2018]. Canine influenza, better known as "dog flu," has been diagnosed in a number of dogs in the South Bay recently, veterinarians said.

United Veterinary Specialty and Emergency Hospital in Campbell has seen about 70 dogs with signs and/or known exposure to the flu, according to Stephanie LaPlume, a veterinarian with the hospital. Other South Bay hospitals, including Los Gatos Dog and Cat Hospital, also report seeing dogs with flu.

The virus can't be passed on to humans but is highly contagious among dogs, a veterinarian said. Dog owners are encouraged to vaccinate their dogs and avoid taking their dogs to places where they would come in contact with other dogs.

"We are recommending our clients not take their dogs to dog parks, boarding facilities, doggie day care, grooming," said Megan Hanken, a veterinarian with Los Gatos Dog and Cat Hospital.

"The big thing is vaccination, and being careful of where your dog is going," Hanken said. As with humans, even if the dog were to get the flu after being vaccinated, "it will decrease their clinical signs," she said.

Pet owners can contact their veterinarians to ask about vaccination, she said.

Dogs who have the flu can show mild signs, severe signs or no signs, according to Courtney Campbell, a Ventura vet who is the host of Nat Geo Wild's Pet Talk.

"For dogs who have contracted the H3N2 virus, the onset of clinical signs is often rapid, i.e. 2 or 3 days," Campbell said.

"And for the following 10-14 days, pet parents may see their dogs cough, sneeze, spray nasal discharge, act lethargic, and have trouble breathing. All of these signs can look similarly analogous to a person that has caught the flu," Campbell said.

There is some good news, Campbell said: "In some cases, the cough and illness will resolve on its own in a couple weeks."

["Canine influenza [CI] or dog flu is a highly contagious respiratory infection of dogs that is caused by an influenza A virus. In the US, CI has been caused by 2 influenza strains. The 1st strain reported in the United States, beginning in 2004, was an H3N8 influenza A virus. This strain is closely related to the virus that causes equine influenza, and it is thought that the equine influenza virus mutated to produce the canine strain. In 2015, an outbreak that started in Chicago was caused by a separate CI virus, H3N2. The strain causing the 2015 outbreak was almost genetically identical to an H3N2 strain previously reported only in Asia, specifically, Korea, China, and Thailand. In Asia, this H3N2 strain is believed to have resulted from the direct transfer of an avian influenza virus -- possibly from among viruses circulating in live bird markets -- to dogs. Since March 2015, thousands of dogs have been confirmed positive for H3N2 CI across the US," https://www.avma.org/KB/Resources/FAQs/Pages/Control-of-Canine-Influenza-in-Dogs.aspx.

Healthy dogs can be vaccinated and should be if you must board your animal. There is a vaccine for both strains of the flu mentioned above. If the virus is circulating in your area, avoiding canine social activities (dog parks, play dates, interactions in the park, etc.) may help protect your dog.

Canine influenza viruses (H3N2 and H3N8) are not known to infect humans (https://www.cdc.gov/flu/canineflu/keyfacts.htm). - Mod.TG
