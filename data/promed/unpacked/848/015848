An investigation carried out in Spain found a high incidence of hepatitis E (HEV) in HIV-infected patients. The incidence of hepatitis by HEV was detected in this work to 7.2 cases per 100 patients per year. This is a prospective work done in 698 HIV-infected patients without antibodies in the blood of HEV, who were followed for 1 year. The study described the clinical manifestations of acute hepatitis E in patients infected with HIV, whose form of presentation was primarily a febrile syndrome with or without elevated liver enzymes. In the study, led by Antonio Rivero Juarez, researcher of the study group of the Spanish Society of Infectious Diseases and Clinical Microbiology (GeSIDA), a higher incidence of hepatitis E was noted in the rural areas (17.4 cases per 100 patients per year), and no relationship was found between hepatitis E and other possible risk factors associated with HIV or coinfection with hepatitis B or C.

Developed at the Maimonides Institute for Biomedical Research of Cordoba by a team of scientific experts in infectious diseases, the study was presented at the Congress on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (CROI), the most important scientific meeting of the world on this matter, held last week in Seattle (Washington state, USA).

HEV is an RNA virus that has been described with 4 genotypes of different epidemiological and clinical characteristics. Genotypes 1 and 2 are transmitted primarily by contaminated drinking water, and to a lesser extent by person-to-person contact, affecting exclusively humans in the form of disease outbreaks. On the contrary, genotypes 3 and 4 are zoonotic infections and endemic, whose reservoirs are pigs, wild boars and other animals living free, being transmitted by direct contact or consumption of meat from infected animals. Recent studies in slaughterhouses and chains of European food production suggest that the high presence of HEV genotype 3 in animal products for human consumption, and the spread of the HEV genotype 3 to humans through this track could become important.

[The following is in part derived from Pavio N, Meng X-J, Renou C: Zoonotic hepatitis E: animal reservoirs and emerging risks. Vet Res. 2010; 41(6): 46. doi: 10.1051/vetres/2010018 (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2865210/):

The particularity of HEV is that, among all known major hepatitis viruses (A, B, C, and D), HEV is the only one with certain genotypes (3 and 4) with animal reservoirs. Swine HEV was 1st isolated and genetically characterized from pigs in the USA in 1997, even though HEV antibodies and RNA were reportedly detected from pigs in the Kathmandu Valley of Nepal but the identity of the virus infecting the Nepalese pigs was not determined in that study. More recently, an avian HEV was identified and characterized from chickens with hepatitis-splenomegaly (HS) syndrome in 2001 in the USA as well. Besides swine and chickens, recently strains of HEV have been genetically identified from deer, mongooses, rabbits, and rats.

Accumulating evidence indicates that hepatitis E is a zoonotic disease, and swine (and likely other animal species) are reservoirs. Swine and human strains of HEV are genetically closely related and, in some cases, indistinguishable, and direct transmissions through the consumption of contaminated food products such as pork have been reported in Japan. Thus, zoonotic transmission of hepatitis E raises an important public health concern over food safety and zoonotic risk. - Mod.LL
