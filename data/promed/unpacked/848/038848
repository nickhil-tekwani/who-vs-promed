A 3-year-old boy in Thatta's Mirpur Sakhro has been diagnosed with polio in Sindh, bringing the total for 2019 to 25 cases and Pakistan's tally to 135. The Emergency Operation Centre (EOC) for polio in Sindh confirmed the case.

This is not a case from 2020, as the 34-month boy was affected by polio with weakness in the left upper and lower limbs on [26 Dec 2019]. According to his parents, he had received 7 doses of the oral polio vaccine and 3 routine doses plus the IPV were verified by card. An investigation has been opened into these claims.

EOC Sindh's spokesperson said that the long gap in door-to-door campaigns during 2019 created a large pool of vulnerable children. The National EOC and Sindh EOC have started to fight back to eradicate polio and reverse this trend. The 1st step was the successful December [2019] NID, and now areas with recent detections are being targeted in a special response round starting from [13 Jan 2020].

"We will follow this up with 2 NIDs in February and April [2020) with another targeted case response in between," the spokesperson said. Efforts from December [2019] to April [2020] will bridge the immunity gap and lead to a significant decrease in the intensity of virus transmission in the 2nd half of 2020, they said.

Up until this case was detected, Sindh had 24 polio cases in 2019, out of which 6 came from Karachi. There were 134 cases that emerged from all over Pakistan:
- 91 in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa
- 24 in Sindh
- 11 in Balochistan
- 8 in Punjab

Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah met the Provincial Task Force on Polio Eradication on Saturday [11 Jan 2020]. The meeting was attended by ministers Dr. Azra Pechuho, Syed Nasir Shah, PSCM Sajid Jamal Abro, Karachi Commissioner Iftikhar Shahalwani, LG Secretary Roshan Shaikh, Health Secretary Zahid Abbasi, all deputy commissioners of the city, all commissioners and deputy commissioners of other divisions and districts via video link.

The details of the 6 polio cases detected in Karachi in 2019:
- 25 Feb: A 3-year-old from Lyari's Shahbaig Lane; she is Baloch and hails from Quetta
- 20 Apr: An 8-month-old in Orangi from a Pashtun family
- 26 Aug: A 16-month-old in Orangi from a Punjabi family from Multan
- 29 Apr: A 6-month-old from Gulzar-e-Hijri from a Pashtun family
- 24 Oct: A 2-year-old at Jacob Lines from a Sindhi family and from Hyderabad
- 29 Oct: A 12-month-old in Keamari from a Baloch family

The polio cases detected from other divisions of the province are:
- 17 Apr: A 3-year-old in Dokri, Larkana from a Seraiki family; she originally belonged to Gadap, Karachi
- 20 Jul: A 1-year-old in Halanaka, Hyderabad, from a Pashtun family who originally hails from Gadap, Karachi
- 23 Aug: A 10-year-old in Latifabad, Hyderabad from a Mohajir family
- 23 Aug: A 3-year-old in Kotri, Hyderabad from a Pashtun family
- 25 Sep: A 3.6-year-old from Sujawal, Thatta-Hyderabad, from a Sindhi family
- 9 Oct: A 1-month-old in Kotri, Jamshoro from a Sindhi family
- 19 Oct: A 3-year-old from Sakrand-Shaheed Benazirabad from a Baloch family who originally belongs to SITE, Karachi
- 27 Oct: An 8.4-year-old from a Sindhi family detected in Rahooja, Sukkur and who hails from Landhi, Karachi
- 2 Nov: A 2-year-old from Wareh, Kambar Shahdadkot
- 9 Nov: A 9-month-old in Dokri, Larkana from a Seraiki family that hails from SITE, Karachi
- 10 Nov: A 2.4-year-old from a Sindhi family detected in Chambar, Tando Allahayar and originally hails from Landhi, Karachi
- 17 Nov: A 3.6-year-old from Digri, Mirpurkhas from a Mohajir family
- 20 Nov: A 6-year-old from a Sindhi family detected in Mirpurkhas and that originally belongs to SITE, Karachi
- 28 Nov: A 6-year-old from a Seraiki family, detected in Matli, Badin
- 1 Dec: A 4-year-old from a Sindhi family in Sindhri, Mirpurkhas
- 1 Dec: A 12-year-old from a Sindhi family detected in Sehwan, Jamshoro
- 6 Dec: A 5-month-old from a Sindhi family detected in Patt, Dadu
- 14 Dec: A 3-year-old from Wareh, Kambar-Shahdadkot from a Sindhi family

The chief minister said that most of the polio cases have links with Karachi; therefore, the health department and its other wings have to focus on Karachi by segregating the areas so that their environmental samples could be made negative. Gulshan, Baldia, SITE, Korangi, Liaquatabad and Saddar have had positive environmental samples throughout 2019. Sukkur, Jacobabad, Hyderabad, Dadu and Kambar-Shahdadkot have also been positive.

Polio vaccine coverage: EOC In-charge Rehan Baloch told the chief minister that there was target of 9 076 523 children:
- 2 293 687 in Karachi
- 2 160 552 in Hyderabad
- 1 514 246 in Larkana
- 785 475 in Mirpurkhas
- 1 093 139 in Nawabshah
- 1 229 424 in Sukkur

He said that 82.1% missed children were also covered and yet 295 704 children were missed. The chief minister was told that 95% coverage has been achieved in 7 days of December 2019 in Karachi and 100% in other divisions.

There are 782 union councils where environmental samples are positive for polio viruses.

[Yet another case of polio confirmed in Sindh, Pakistan with date of onset in 2019, bringing the total to 135 cases in Pakistan. Presumably this is associated with a wild poliovirus or it would not have been grouped with the 134 other WPV1-associated cases.

One disturbing fact is that this child had documented receipt of 7 doses of campaign vaccine, 3 doses of routine vaccination and 1 dose of IPV. Hence, this child should have been protected. This warrants further investigation.
