The EU ban on British beef exports will end on 1 Aug 1999 after a vote by
the
European Union's veterinary committee. The committee members agreed to let
in sales of British beef again after receiving assurances that it was now
safe to eat. Europe's Farm Commissioner Franz Fischler told the BBC:
"What has changed is very clear. First of all, we have got positive advice
from
our scientists. Secondly, we did a lot of inspections in the United Kingdom
and the results are now all positive, so it is justified now to lift the
ban. British beef is safe. If I wouldn't be convinced about that, then I
would not vote in favour to lift the ban."
Even when the ban is lifted, precautionary restrictions will still apply.
Meat for export must be de-boned and come from cattle born after 1 August
1996 - the date on which a ban came into force on the feeding to animals of
meat and bone-meal. In addition, meat from cattle more than 30 months old
will not be sold overseas. This so-called "date-based" scheme was offered to
Brussels as the answer to the crisis after months of negotiations.
Exports from Northern Ireland resumed a year ago because the province has
sophisticated computerised cattle monitoring and checking systems.
Britain still has more reported cases of BSE than any other EU country,
although this year's figure of 1000 so far contrasts with a peak in 1992 of
more than 36 000.
Farmers have declared 14 July 1999 National British Beef Day to celebrate
the
lifting of the ban on British beef exports. Farmers' leaders said the vote
was the "beginning of the end" after a crisis which had cost the industry
UKL1.5bn.
But UK Agriculture Minister Nick Brown warned there was still work to be
done in winning over beef buyers abroad. He told MPs: "I am very pleased to
inform the House that the European Commission this morning adopted a
decision that has the affect of lifting the beef ban for the whole of the
United Kingdom."
The ban was imposed three years ago in response to fears about the spread of
BSE or mad cow disease. The lifting of the ban is expected to trigger a
major marketing campaign.
