New cases of anthrax have been registered in Azerbaijan. The Ministry
of Health has now confirmed 4 cases.
2 inhabitants of the village of Shihmahmud in the Nakhchivan
Autonomous Republic of Azerbaijan -- a father and son -- have been
taken to Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan, with severe disease.
According to the village representative of the executive authority,
the father works as a butcher in the city of Nakhchivan and was
probably infected at work.
Previously, 3 cases of anthrax had been confirmed among inhabitants
of the Samuhskiy district of the country.

[Now, with affected cattle in 3 villages in the Babeksky district and
4 (possibly 5), human cases in Samuhskiy district, it is clear that
probably many human cases (in Babeksky) and bovine cases (in
Samuhskiy) are not getting reported. From the numbers given, it would
seem that one human case is awaiting confirmation. - Mod.MHJ]
