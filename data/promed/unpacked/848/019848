According to the State Research Center for Laboratory Diagnostics and
Veterinary-Sanitary Expertise, there were 778 rabid stray cats and dogs
diagnosed in 2006. This number increased to 1169 in 2007 and to 1181 in
2008, the Comersant published. The head of the State Administration for
Veterinary Medicine, Lyudmila Oleynik, has informed the newspaper that the
main reservoir of rabies are wild foxes.

The specialists of the Center of Laboratory Diagnostics fight against
rabies by dropping edible bait with vaccine in the forests. Meanwhile,
Oleynik said, the mandatory element of the prevention is the vaccination of
domestic animals. The Ukrainian vaccine is being given free of charge to
the private and state veterinary centers. The state budget allocates funds
for vaccine purchase.

Let us be reminded about what happened in the village Borsuki of Ternopol
oblast in June [2009]. A cow was found with suspected rabies. The carcass
has been burned and buried.

[The reportedly increased rabies incidence in Ukraine is somewhat puzzling
in view of the statement that oral vaccination of wildlife is being
applied. It will help to obtain information on the oral vaccination's date
of inauguration, number of distributions per year, mode of application,
number of baits per sq km, geographical coverage, the baiting material used
and the vaccine strain.

The following comments have been received from Corr.VM: "The incidence of
animal rabies is high in the Ukraine. A rabid cow was found in Ternopol
oblast in June (2009) and a goat in Lugansk oblast in July (2009). The best
approach for rabies control remains immunizing wild and domestic animals."
