Altogether 9 people have died of encephalitis in northern West Bengal since May [2015], a health official said here [in Siliguri] on [Wed 8 Jul 2015].

While 6 of the victims were diagnosed to have been inflicted with acute encephalitis syndrome, 3 others fell to Japanese encephalitis [JE], said North Bengal Medical College and Hospital's vice principal and medical superintendent Nirmal Bera.

[Meanwhile,] 10 other patients of encephalitis are under treatment in the hospital. Further, 8 fresh positive cases of encephalitis have been reported in 3 districts -- Jalpaiguri, Alipurduar, and Darjeeling [West Bengal]. One of the patients is from Assam [state].

[As mentioned in previous comments, the encephalitis picture in north eastern India is complicated. The JE virus etiology of some previously reported encephalitis cases has been confirmed by laboratory tests. However, many cases go undiagnosed or JE virus infection is ruled out, and other etiologies, including Reye syndrome-like disease and lychee consumption, have been proposed. No mention is made of JE virus vaccination status of the cases above, nor of the population in the affected area. Vaccination is more likely to be more effective for prevention of JE cases than vector control, particularly in the areas of paddy rice cultivation that provide abundant culex vector mosquito breeding sites. The virus doubtless is endemic in northeastern India. Ardeid birds (heron family) are reservoir hosts.
