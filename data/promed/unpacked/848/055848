Maryland reported its first human death from West Nile virus infection of
2002 on Friday, and Nebraska officials said they may also have seen their
first fatality. 10 other states have reported deaths from the
mosquito-borne disease this summer, as it spread across most of the lower
48 states.
Maryland
--------
EK, 87, of Bethesda, died on Tuesday at the Hospice of Washington after
being admitted to hospital with encephalitis, or swelling of the brain. She
tested positive for the virus, health officials said.
Nebraska
--------
In Nebraska, initial tests show that a 69 year old man who died on 22 Aug
2002 had the virus, said Steve Beal, assistant health director of the
Lincoln-Lancaster County Health Department. Officials were waiting for
confirmation from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in
Atlanta, he said.
Both the Nebraska and Maryland victims had other health problems, officials
said. As of Friday, CDC had recorded 555 human cases -- including 28
fatalities -- of West Nile virus infection this year in 26 states and
Washington DC. Including animal cases, the virus has been seen in 41 states.
