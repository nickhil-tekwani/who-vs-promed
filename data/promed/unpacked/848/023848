[1] EEC implementing decision (EU) 2015/1500, 7 Sep 2015
Date: Tue 8 Sep 2015

[Selected articles]

3. On 20 Aug 2015, the Greek authorities notified the Commission of 2 outbreaks of lumpy skin disease in bovine holdings with approximately 200 bovine animals in Feres area of the regional unit of Evros [Eastern Macedonia and Thrace] in Greece. These outbreaks represent the 1st occurrence of lumpy skin disease in the Union.

4. Greece applied measures within the framework of Directive 92/119/EEC and in particular established protection and surveillance zones around the outbreaks according to Article 10 of that Directive.

5. The risk of spread of the lumpy skin disease virus to other areas of Greece and to other Member States, particularly through trade in live bovine animals and their germinal products, the movement of certain wild ruminants, and the placing on the market of certain products derived from bovine animals should be controlled.

6. In order to prevent its spread to other parts of Greece, to other Member States and third countries, the Commission adopted Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2015/1423 [5] providing for interim protective measures and prohibiting the movement and dispatch of bovine animals and semen thereof as well as the placing on the market of certain animal products from the regional unit of Evros.
[5] Commission Implementing Decision(EU) 2015/1423 of 21 Aug 2015 concerning certain interim protective measures against lumpy skin disease in Greece (OJ L 222, 25.8.2015, p. 7)

11. In the event of an outbreak of lumpy skin disease, Article 19 of Directive 92/119/EEC provides for the possibility to apply vaccination against that disease. At present, the vaccination against lumpy skin disease in Greece is prohibited. However, Greece has indicated their intention to proceed with emergency vaccination against the lumpy skin disease. The risk of spreading the disease by means of animals and products thereof of vaccinated animals is different to those of non-vaccinated animals. Therefore, those risks should be addressed separately and are not subject of this decision.

12. In terms of risk of spreading of lumpy skin disease, different commodities pose different levels of risk. As indicated in the Scientific Opinion of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) on lumpy skin disease [3] the movement of live bovine animals, bovine semen, and raw hides and skins from infected bovine animals pose higher risk in terms of exposure and consequences than other products such as milk and dairy products, treated hides and skins or fresh meat, meat preparations, and meat products originating from bovine animals, where scientific or experimental evidence is lacking on their role of transmission of the disease. Therefore, measures in this Decision need to be balanced and proportionate to the risks.
[3] EFSA Journal 2015; 13(1): 3986 [73 pp.]

13. The movements of live bovine animals out of the regional unit of Evros should continue to be prohibited in order to prevent the spread of the disease. According to the Scientific Opinion of the EFSA on lumpy skin disease and the Word Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) wild fauna, that is, certain exotic wild ruminants may play a potential role in the transmission of the disease, in particular in Africa where the disease is endemic. Therefore some preventive measures should also apply to wild ruminants. In the absence of more precise rules in the Union legislation, the appropriate international standards for such movements provided for in the Terrestrial Animal Health Code of the OIE (OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Code) [4] should be used for this purpose.
[4] 24th Edition, 2015.

14. As Greece has requested for an exemption from the prohibition of the dispatch of bovine animals for direct slaughter from holdings situated in the restricted zone outside protection and surveillance zones and such exemption is foreseen in Article 11.11.5 of the OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Code, it is appropriate to allow the dispatch of such consignments under certain conditions.

15. Similarly, the transmission of the disease through semen and embryos of animals of the bovine species cannot be excluded. Therefore, certain protective measures should be provided for those commodities. In the absence of the Union standards, the Scientific Opinion of the EFSA on lumpy skin disease and the appropriate OIE Animal Health Terrestrial Code recommendations should be used for this purpose.

[2] Greek media - vaccination started
Date: Mon 7 Sep 2015

Veterinarians and their assistants from throughout the Region of Eastern Macedonia and Thrace (REMT) are performing the vaccination of cattle against LSD [lumpy skin disease] in the Ebro Delta and the region of Feres.

Following the delivery of the 1st 8000 vaccine doses during the weekend [5-6 Sep 2015], 8 veterinary teams have started vaccination within the protection and surveillance zones. Out of the total of 5500 cattle in the delta area, 2400 have already been vaccinated, as told to ANA-MPA [Athens-Macedonian News Agency] by the Director of Veterinary Office for Eastern Macedonia, Achilleas Sachpatzidis.

The Director of Veterinary of REMT reported that the number of cattle already slaughtered amounts to 1300 animals, remarking that these figures are modified daily since the disease in the Delta does not present the same picture exhibited in Turkey and Israel, namely that of slow transmission. In the delta it instead transmitted very quickly. He assured that there was no public health threat since the consumption of milk and meat, and in general food products that have undergone high heat treatment, is completely safe. He reiterated that nodular dermatitis [LSD] is not transmitted by direct contact, but by mosquitoes, flies, and ticks. Nevertheless he stressed that all the requisite measures have been applied to safeguard the safety of veterinary equipment and vehicles used for vaccinations in order not to cause further transmission of disease.

Note that preventive vaccination will cover the entire county's cattle population of 20 000 animals.

[According to article 11 in the official EU document above (item 1), "Greece has indicated their intention to proceed with emergency vaccination against lumpy skin disease." There is currently no officially approved vaccine for the disease in the EU. Information on the vaccine applied in the emergency vaccination around the outbreaks which is already operational, will be appreciated.

In January 2015, EFSA published a 'Scientific Opinion on lumpy skin disease' (available at http://www.efsa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/scientific_output/files/main_documents/3986.pdf; see item [3] "EFSA Scientific Opinion" in ProMED-mail posting 20150121.3109000). The following recommendations are derived from the opinion's abstract:

"Whole-herd culling of infected farms substantially reduces the spread of LSD virus, and the more rapidly farms are detected and culled, the greater the magnitude of the reduction is. Only live attenuated vaccines against LSD are available. Homologous vaccines are more effective than sheep-pox strain vaccines. The safety of the vaccines should be improved and the development of vaccines for differentiating between infected and vaccinated animals is recommended. Epidemics are not self-limiting when effective vaccination or culling are not applied."

In the full document (73 pages), subscribers are specifically referred to the opinion's articles 9.3 "vaccines," 9.4 "vaccination in endemic area," and 9.4.1. "Vaccination as control option in free areas" (pages 50-51).

The opinion's statement about homologous vaccines being "more effective than sheep-pox strain vaccines" is partially based upon preliminary results of field trials in Israel with the 2 vaccines compared. These results are yet to be published and are anticipated with interest. It should be borne in mind that a certain percentage of the animals included in the trials had, reportedly, undergone previous vaccination(s), the recording of which deserves consideration in their analysis.

OIE's Terrestrial Animal Health Manual chapter "2.4.14. Lumpy skin disease" (available at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.04.14_LSD.pdf) specifies the tests of the live attenuated capripox vaccines intended for the protection of cattle against LSD. For subscribers' convenience, we copy herewith some of OIE's requirements for authorisation of the final product, namely, "Efficacy requirements (for animal production):"

"The efficacy of the vaccine must be demonstrated in vaccination challenge experiments under laboratory conditions. 6 cattle of known susceptibility to LSD are placed in a high containment level large animal unit. 5 randomly chosen vials of the freeze-dried vaccine are reconstituted in sterile PBS [phosphate-buffered saline] and pooled. 4 cattle are vaccinated with the recommended dose using the recommended route. The remaining 2 cattle are control animals. On day 21 after vaccination, the 6 animals are challenged with a known virulent capripoxvirus strain by intradermal inoculation. The clinical response is recorded during the following 14 days. Control animals should develop the typical clinical signs of LSD, whereas there should be no local or systemic reaction in the vaccinates other than a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction, which should disappear after 4 days. Because of the variable response in cattle to LSD challenge, generalised disease may not be seen in the control animals, although there should be a large local reaction."

Currently, both sheep-pox and Neethling-based, live attenuated vaccines are applied in the affected countries. Controlled tests with currently available vaccines deserve serious consideration.

On 4 Sep 2015, Greece submitted to the OIE its follow up report no 1 on LSD, reporting 4 new outbreaks in Evros; see, with map, at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=18589. - Mod.AS]
