One horse, a gelding, in Snohomish County, Washington, was confirmed with equine herpesvirus (EHV), according to a report from the Washington Department of Agriculture on the Equine Disease Communication Center.

The 11-year-old warmblood gelding had onset of clinical signs on 1 Mar 2019, and confirmation of EHV was reported on 5 Mar 2019. Those signs included intermittent fever. The gelding was vaccinated and now is recovering.

[We are delighted to hear the horse is recovering from this nasty disease.

We are not told whether this is equine herpesvirus 1 (EHV-1) or equine herpesvirus 4 (EHV-4). EHV-1 and EHV-4 comprise 2 antigenically distinct groups of viruses previously referred to as subtypes 1 and 2 of EHV-1. Both viruses are ubiquitous in horse populations worldwide and produce an acute febrile respiratory disease upon primary infection, characterized by rhinopharyngitis and tracheobronchitis. Outbreaks of respiratory disease occur annually among foals in areas with concentrated horse populations. Most of these outbreaks in weanlings are caused by strains of EHV-4. The age, seasonal, and geographic distributions vary and are determined by immune status and horse population. In individual horses, the outcome of exposure is determined by viral strain, immune status, pregnancy status, and possibly age. Infection of pregnant mares with EHV-4 rarely results in abortion https://www.merckvetmanual.com/respiratory-system/respiratory-diseases-of-horses/equine-herpesvirus-infection. - Mod.TG
