----------------------------------------------------------------------
Regarding the moderator's (CP) comments on the Start Tribune article [dated Wed 29 Aug 2012], the moderator states (incorrectly): "...whereas the 1st case was a child presumed to have contracted infection from a pig displayed at the state fair."

That is incorrect. In the article itself, and in the ProMED-mail announcement 16 lines above the moderator's comment, it clearly states, "Minnesota reported its 1st human case of the new virus in a preschooler who visited a live-animal market on 10 Aug 2012." So, no, the 1st case did not contract the infection at the state fair. Also, the Minnesota State Fair opened on 23 Aug 2012 and runs through Labor Day (and 10 Aug 2012 is outside that date range).

[ProMED-mail thanks Professor Marie Gramer for drawing attention to this error, which was also reported by Richard N Danila, PhD, MPH, Acute Disease Investigation and Control Section Manager, and Deputy State Epidemiologist Minnesota Department of Health, St Paul, Minnesota.

Dr Danila has provided the additional information that: "Our 1st confirmed case, who had a sibling which we identified as a probable case, also acquired their infections at the same live animal market where they had been with their parents who purchased 2 pigs on 10 Aug 2012 (not at a swine exhibit as posted by the moderator)."

The moderator apologises for the erroneous comment, which was based on a misreading of the text of the press report. - Mod.CP]
