Chinese President Hu Jintao said on Sat [19 Nov 2005] that China stands
ready to cooperate closely with the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
(APEC) in the prevention and control of avian influenza. Speaking at the 2
day meeting of the APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting in South Korea's
southeastern port city of Busan, Hu said China will host the APEC Symposium
on Emerging Infectious Disease in Beijing next April.
Avian influenza poses a challenge to the Asia-Pacific region and the world
at large, Hu said. He urged APEC members to make joint efforts to cooperate
closely to meet such a challenge. Hu said China welcomes the APEC members
to attend the APEC Symposium on Emerging Infectious Disease to strengthen
regional cooperation in the area.
China attaches importance to the prevention and control of avian influenza
and has adopted a series of effective measures including intensive
vaccination, monitoring and quarantine, he said.
Hu said China attaches importance to international cooperation in natural
disaster reduction and is actively involved in it. "China stands ready to
strengthen communication and cooperation with other APEC members and
jointly enhance regional cooperation in disaster reduction," he said.
The Chinese president left Busan for Beijing on Saturday after the 2 day
APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting concluded with the adoption of the Busan
Declaration, the Statement on Doha Development Agenda Negotiations, and the
Statement on Preparing for and Mitigating an Influenza Pandemic.
