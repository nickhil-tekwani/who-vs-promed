Suspected bird flu patient dies in Bandung
------------------------------------------
An official at the Hasan Sadikin Hospital in Bandung, West Java, confirmed on Sunday [4 Mar 2012] that a 42 year old patient having been treated for bird flu [avian A/(H5N1) influenza virus infection] symptoms since 29 Feb 2012 died in the hospital's isolation room.

"The team of doctors pronounced him dead at 10:10 pm last night [3 Mar 2012]," said Primal Sudjana, the spokesman for the avian flu control [team] at the hospital. Primal said that the patient suffered multiple organ failure as his kidneys, respiratory system, and liver malfunctioned. According to Primal, the patient was in a severe condition upon his admission to the hospital. The patient had been treated previously at the Ujung Berung Hospital and later at the Emmanuel Hospital, both also in Bandung. "As his condition worsened, he was transferred to the [Hasan Sadikin] hospital," said Primal according to a report by the Antara News Agency.

Early last month [February 2012], a 37 year old newspaper vendor, suspected of being infected with bird flu died after being isolated for more than 30 hours at the Hasan Sadikin Hospital.

In January [2012], 2 residents of Tangerang [Banten province] who died at the Tangerang General Hospital (RSUD) were also suspected of being infected with bird flu.
