OFFICIAL RELEASE
DATE: 23 Jan 2001
TO: Director, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
FROM: Director, Division of Viral and Rickettsial Diseases (DVRD), National
Center for Infectious Diseases (NCID)
SUBJECT: Investigation of a possible outbreak of Q fever in humans and
goats in Wyoming
LOCATION: Hulett, Wyoming
Nature of Problem: In late December [2000 and early January [2001, a goat
herd consisting of approximately 400 animals in Hulett, Wyoming experienced
very high rates of abortion and stillbirths (over 50% of parturient
animals). The animals subsequently tested positive for antibodies to
_Coxiella burnetii_, the etiologic agent of Q fever.
Of 4 persons who had direct contact with the animals, 2 have developed
clinical signs consistent with Q fever infection. Serologic tests are
pending. Because of the zoonotic nature of this disease and the possibility
of environmental contamination, the state health department is requesting
assistance for rapid assessment of the situation.
Date Problem First Identified by the Requesting Agency: 22 Jan 2001
Date of Initial CDC Contact: 23 Jan 2001
In addition to contacting the CDC, the Bioterrorism coordinator and the
laboratory director for the Wyoming Department of Health, and the United
States Department of Agriculture have also been alerted.
Objectives of the investigation:
1) To find cases of Q fever in humans who may have had contact with
infected animals,
2) to determine the source of infection and mode of transmission,
3) to assess the extent of _C. burnetii_ infection in the goat herd, and
4) to provide recommendations for control and prevention.

[The causative agent (_Coxiella burnetii_) is highly infectious to animals
and people by aerosol transmission of infected particles, by direct contact
or by ingestion of certain tissues where the organism concentrates. The
organism is concentrated in placentas, other reproductive fluids, body
fluids, milk, urine and feces. The agent has been documented in the wool of
affected sheep.
Ticks may serve as a reservoir of the organism, especially the Ixodid and
Argasid ticks. The organism may circulate between the ectoparasites,
usually ticks, and wild animals, independent of a cycle in domestic
animals. Worldwide distribution has affected birds, arthropods, and a
variety of wild and domestic mammals, including cattle, sheep, goats, dogs,
cats and man.
Infection in animals is often subclinical, but may be manifest as anorexia
and abortion in sheep and goats. Infertility and sporadic abortion in
cattle have been reported. _C. burnetii_ in ruminants may localize in
mammary glands, supramammary lymph nodes, placenta, and uterus, from which
it may be shed at subsequent parturitions and lactations.
In people, this disease may be self limiting, presenting as a nonspecific
febrile illness between 2 and 14 days in length, characterized by headache,
fatigue, and myalgia. Pneumonia, hepatitis, aseptic meningitis,
encephalitis, osteomyelitis, and culture-negative endocarditis are known
complications. Pre-existing valvular heart disease is usually present in
those who develop endocarditis.
Neither the human nor the animal vaccine is available in the United States.
Tetracycline and doxycycline are the drugs of choice for treatment in
animals and people. - Mod.TG/DS/SH
