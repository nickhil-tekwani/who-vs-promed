Measures to be applied: vector surveillance

Diagnostic test results
Central veterinary investigation laboratory, Kabete (national laboratory)
Species / Test / Test date / Result
Cattle / IgM-capture ELISA / 27 Feb 2019 / positive

[Abortions in cattle have been reported in Nyandarua County (in Kenya's former Central province) since December 2018. Due to the drought conditions prevailing at that time, which are regarded unfavourable for vector amplification, Rift Valley fever (RVF) was not suspected. However, when 2 RVF cases were diagnosed in humans in February 2019 in Ol Kalou, the capital of Nyandarua County (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20190213.6315356), surveillance in animals, particularly addressing aborting cattle, was intensified. This led to the discovery of RVF in animals as described in the OIE notification. Mass vaccination followed.

In June-July 2018, a major RVF epidemic hit Kenya, particularly in its eastern area, affecting both humans and animals; 10 outbreaks were reported. These outbreaks were located in the counties of Wajir, Tana River, Isiolo, Siaya, Baringo, Marsabit, Mandera, and Meru. The event was resolved on 30 Jul 2018. See event summary and updated map at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=26827. In the same period, RVF infections occurred also in Uganda and Rwanda. - Mods.AS/CRD
