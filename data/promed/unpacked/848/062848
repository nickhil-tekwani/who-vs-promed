CORAL REEF KILLS, HUMAN WASTE SUSPECTED - CARIBBEAN

Bacteria found in the intestines of humans and other animals have been
identified as the cause of a disease killing elkhorn corals [_Acropora
palmata_] in the Caribbean Sea. First reported in 1996, the disease has
spread widely, causing severe damage to the branched corals.
On some reefs near Key West, mortality of elkhorn has reached 95 percent,
and the disease has been recorded in the US Virgin Islands, Caribbean areas
of Mexico, the Bahamas, and Florida, said James Porter of the University of
Georgia.
Porter and his research team traced the white pox disease [whitepox, one
word, is also a term used in poxvirus virology, as discussed below - Mod.LL]
that causes the problem to _Serratia marcescens_ bacteria, which are widely
found in the intestines of humans and other animals. The findings are
reported in the US Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
"Elkhorn used to be the commonest coral in the Caribbean, but now it has
been proposed for inclusion on the endangered species list," Porter said.
''But how would the bacteria get to the coral? We don't know . . . We are
investigating the possibility that the origin of the bacteria is human
waste, but we don't know."
That is a crucial question in the Florida Keys, where most waste is treated
in septic fields rather than undergoing extensive treatment to kill the
bacteria. "The implications for people in the Florida Keys are high," Porter
said. Discussions are under way about improving wastewater treatment, he
said, but it costs a lot and state and federal help are not assured.
"Everyone down here is in love with the water," he said. "They want to do
the right thing, but the cost to maintain the highest water quality
standards could be prohibitive for the individual citizenry."
Cheva Heck of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Keys
National Marine Sanctuary agreed that while the bacteria have an association
with humans, "the research itself doesn't tell us where it comes from." Dale
Griffin, of the US Geological Survey's Center for Regional and Coastal
Studies in Florida, said he found it interesting that bacteria with a fecal
source have been identified as pathogens in the reef.
"One of the primary concerns in the Florida Keys is the waste disposal
problem," said Griffin, who was not part of the research team. He noted the
paper made no conclusion about the source of the bacteria killing the
corals.
Coral colonies affected by white pox have irregularly shaped white spots
that eventually grow and kill the coral by consuming the thin layer of
living tissue that covers a coral's limestone skeleton. The bacteria can
grow by as much as 19 sq.cm. a day. Treating the infected coral also poses
problems, as the bacteria have become resistant to antibiotics, Porter said
in a telephone interview. [It would be quite interesting to know the pattern
of resistance to antimicrobial agents. A _S. marcescens_ strain resistant
to agents commonly used to treat human infections may assist in identifying
a human fecal source. -Mod.LL]
Meanwhile, stress caused by the warming of the waters in the region is
weakening the corals, making them more vulnerable to infection, he said.
White pox disease has struck only elkhorn coral so far, something Porter
found surprising. Other corals have their own problems, such as bleaching
when the algae that populate and build the corals die off. That problem that
has been increasing, and many put the blame on global warming.

[This is an example of a pathogen that causes totally different infections
in plants & humans. Another example is _Burkholderia cepacia_ (previous
taxonomy for this Gram-negative bacillus: _Pseudomonas cepacia_) which,
among other things, can cause respiratory infections in humans with cystic
fibrosis, but was first described by Burkholder (1) associated with
sour-skin disease of onions.
The viral disease known as whitepox was initially isolated from monkeys and
rodents in Equatorial Africa. Marennikova (2) suggested that it is a
variant of monkeypox virus; however, whether this is the case is not clear.
It is not a suspect in connection with this coral disease.
_Serratia marcescens_ is a Gram-negative bacillus in the family
Enterobacteriaceae. Some strains produce a red-to-pink pigment that may
have been the cause of the development of bloody discoloration of food as
described as early as the 6th century BC by Pythagoras (3). Until the
middle of the 20th century, the organism was considered a harmless commensal
(reasonable definition: an organism that eats with you, not eats
you) but is now considered a potential cause of a variety of human
infections, often nosocomial (hospital acquired) in origin.
The bacterium may be quite resistant to many antimicrobial agents. During
the time when
it was considered to be a nonpathogen, it was reported to have been used as
a biologic marker for biowarfare by the US military, having been released in
the Pacific Ocean near San Francisco and followed in the environment (4).
Whether the development of osteomyelitis and endocarditis in Bay Area
intravenous drug users due to _S. marcescens_ [mostly in the mid-1970s but
occurring as early as 1951 (5)] had anything to do with the military studies
more than 2 decades before is not known. Yu (3) states that covert
_S. marcescens_ aerosolization studies were also done in Alabama and Key
West, Florida at the same time as the San Francisco studies. Again, whether
this release in 1951 is at all related to the white pox of elkhorn coral is
pure speculation.
