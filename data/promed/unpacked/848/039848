More than 160 people in the Himachal Pradesh state capital [Shimla]
have tested positive for hepatitis E [virus infection] -- a liver
problem caused by the consumption of water contaminated by sewerage --
since the outbreak of the disease in mid-January [2010], officials
said Thursday [18 Feb 2010]. "Patients suffering from jaundice
(hepatitis E virus infection) are being reported at various government
and private hospitals of Shimla. 12 patients were admitted to various
hospitals yesterday (Wed 17 Feb 2010). [Up to the present], 161
patients have been reported," Vinod Mehta, the surveillance officer of
the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme, told IANS [Indo Asian
News Service] Thursday [18 Feb 2010].

The National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) in New Delhi has
already confirmed the prevalence of hepatitis E mainly from the
Khalini, Panthaghati, Vikas Nagar, and Kasumpti areas of Shimla.
"Since the incubation period of the water-borne disease is up to 90
days, the people who acquired the disease when there was problem of
water contamination in January [2010] would continue to report [until
the end of March 2010]," he said. "Now, there is no problem of water
contamination. The health department and the municipal corporation are
regularly monitoring the water samples," he added.

An official of the Shimla Municipal Corporation said the source of
water contamination was located soon after the outbreak of the disease
and the problem has been rectified. "We are regularly conducting
random water sampling from localities affected by jaundice. We are
also educating people to take preventive measures against the disease
like consuming boiled water," said municipal health officer Sonam Negi.

Locals, however, claim that the state government [has] yet to realize
the gravity of the problem and provide the residents safe potable
water. "The water supplied from the Ashwani Khud drinking water scheme
(around 25 km [16 mi] from Shimla) is not fit for consumption as there
is no proper chlorination and filtration of water," a resident of Bhim
Singh Thakur said.

In 2007 the disease was also reported in these localities and more
than 1000 cases of jaundice were reported at that time.

[Hepatitis E is caused by infection with hepatitis E virus, a
non-enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus. The virus is
transmitted via the faecal-oral route. Hepatitis E is a waterborne
disease, and contaminated water or food supplies have been implicated
in major outbreaks. Consumption of faecally contaminated drinking
water has given rise to epidemics, and the ingestion of raw or
uncooked shellfish has been the source of sporadic cases in endemic
areas. There is a possibility of zoonotic spread of the virus, since
several non-human primates: pigs, cows, sheep, goats and rodents, are
susceptible to infection. In general, hepatitis E is a self-limiting
infection followed by recovery. No cases of chronic infections have
been recognised so far.

According to the WHO hepatitis E fact sheet
<http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs280/en/index.html>, the
incubation period following exposure to hepatitis E virus ranges from
3 to 8 weeks, with a mean of 40 days. Since the 1st cases were
observed in mid January 2010, contamination of the water supply must
have occurred sometime after the beginning of November 2009. It is
likely that further cases will be diagnosed. Fortunately
person-to-person transmission of hepatitis E is uncommon, provided
acceptable standards of personal hygiene are practiced.

The source of the contamination of the water supply to areas of the
city of Shimla has not been disclosed and the local population remain
unconvinced that the hepatitis E outbreak has been contained.
