Sigatoka disease spreads through banana plantations
---------------------------------------------------
Heavy, sustained rainfall outside the normal rainy season has
triggered an upsurge in the spread of _Mycosphaerella fijiensis_, the
fungus that causes black sigatoka disease, in banana plantations south
of Lake Maracaibo in north western Venezuela.

Flooding has affected around 15 000 [37 000 acres] of the 67 000
hectares [166 000 acres] of banana plantations in the area, where
there are some 2500 banana trees per hectare [about 1000 trees per
acre], biologist Meliton Bracho said.

"The fungus, which was first brought to Venezuela in 1991 through
plant waste carried by the Catatumbo River from Colombia, has advanced
considerably," he added.

[Black sigatoka (BS), also known as black leaf streak, is caused by
the fungus _Mycosphaerella fijiensis_, which affects only species of
_Musa_. Worldwide, BS is one of the most devastating leaf diseases of
bananas. It is present in the Americas, China, South East Asia, and
parts of Africa. Several outbreaks in Australia have been successfully
eradicated. Infection occurs on the youngest leaves of the plant
during and immediately after unfurling. Older leaves are not readily
infected.

BS causes destruction of banana leaf tissue, which affects the
photosynthetic capabilities and therefore general vigour of the plant.
It can reduce yields by 50 per cent or more. Fruit produced on
diseased plants can ripen prematurely during commercial shipment and
cause further losses. It is spread by water, wind, and contaminated
materials (including suckers for planting and the floating plant waste
mentioned above). Disease management includes phytosanitary measures
to reduce inoculum, frequent applications of fungicides, and cultural
practices, but the high costs of these measures make them essentially
unavailable to smallholder farmers.

The related species _M. musicola_ causes yellow sigatoka (YS).
Symptoms of both diseases are often similar. YS is less serious than
BS, however, because symptoms appear mainly on older leaves and
therefore less damage is caused to photosynthetic tissue. Also, there
are more cultivars of banana and plantain with degrees of resistance
to YS than to BS. Wind-borne spores may spread both diseases over long
distances, despite local quarantine measures, and both continue to
spread in the Americas and Caribbean.
