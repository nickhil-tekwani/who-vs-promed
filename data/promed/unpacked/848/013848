Waldo County resident dies from tick-borne illness
--------------------------------------------------
A Waldo County resident has died from the rare Powassan virus, which is contracted through an infected tick bite.

According to a news release issued Wednesday [20 Apr 2022] by the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the person likely became infected in Maine and developed neurological symptoms.

The release states that only about 25 cases of Powassan virus are reported each year, with Maine identifying 14 cases since 2010.

Powassan is considered a very serious tick-borne illness, due to its ability to cause encephalitis and other neurological problems, and is often transmitted by deer ticks [also termed blacklegged ticks _Ixodes scapularis_], according to an article by the Maine CDC.

Symptoms of the virus often appear between a week and a month from the tick bite, and may include fever, headache, vomiting, weakness, confusion, seizures, or memory loss, the release states, and in rare cases, neurologic problems, such as brain or spinal cord inflammation, may occur.

"Ticks are active and looking for a host to bite right now. I urge Maine people and visitors to take steps that prevent tick bites," Nirav Shah, director of the Maine CDC, said in the release.

The Maine CDC offers tips on its website to prevent getting bit and what to do if you are [https://www.maine.gov/dhhs/mecdc/infectious-disease/epi/vector-borne/lyme/tick-prevention-and-property-management.shtml].

Know your surroundings. A tick habitat includes tall grass in wooded areas and places with brush.

Use EPA-approved insect repellent on skin and Permethrin on clothing.

Check for ticks during and after encountering a tick habitat.

If you have been bit and the tick is embedded, remove it as soon as possible with a tick removal device, tweezers, or a tick spoon. Once removed, wash the area with soap and water.

[This is the season when Powassan virus-transmitting ticks are active again in the northeastern USA, including in Maine. As noted in earlier posts, humans become infected with POWV during spillover transmission from the natural transmission cycles. In humans, POWV is the causative agent of a severe neuroinvasive illness with 50% of survivors displaying long-term neurological sequelae. Unfortunately, the above case was fatal. POWV was recognized as a human pathogen in 1958, when a young boy died of severe encephalitis in Powassan, Ontario, Canada.

There are 2 distinct genetic lineages of POWV now recognized: POWV (lineage I) and black-legged tick virus (lineage II). Since the index case in 1958, over 100 human cases of POWV have been reported, with an apparent rise in disease incidence in the past 17 years. This recent increase in cases may represent a true emergence of POWV in regions where the tick vector species are prevalent, or it could represent an increase in POWV surveillance and diagnosis. In the past 9 years, both basic and applied research for POWV disease has intensified, including phylogenetic studies, field surveillance, case studies, and animal model development.

Residents and visitors in Maine and other localities where Powassan virus occurs are well-advised to heed CDC advice to avoid tick bites (see https://www.cdc.gov/ticks/avoid/on_people.html). The fact that cases of human Powassan virus infections occur only rarely does not mean that precautions should be ignored. - Mod.TY
