The Emergency Services of Armenia (SSA) denied on Thursday [31 May 2007]
information about a foot and mouth disease [FMD] outbreak, which supposedly
had been recorded in the Syunik region of Armenia.
It has been [clarified] that the information distributed by the SSA press
office on 29 May 2007 was incorrect. In fact, the SSA report received by
the news agency Novosti-Armenia, was related to spring preventive
vaccination against FMD by the regional veterinary service.
The daily SSA report of 29 May [2007], reported on about 120 heads of
cattle in the town of Syunik and in 3 villages of the Sisian region, which
had contracted FMD.

[We are not in a position to say which information is accurate: the one
published on 29 May 2007 on 4 foci of FMD in 182 bovines (100 in Sisian, 60
in Ahlatyan, 10 in Shamb, and 12 in Uyts), as posted in ProMED-mail
20070530.1747, or the later denial of 31 May 2007, related to a total of
120 heads of cattle in the 4 locations.
According to OIE (Office International des Epizooties; World Organization
for Animal Health) sources, Armenia reported the absence of FMD during 2005
and 2006. It is to be hoped that this disease situation still prevails.
Verification is within the capacity of Armenia's responsible authority,
which is -- according to OIE's data -- the State Veterinary Inspection,
Ministry of Agriculture, Yerevan.
It may be noted that the Syunik region borders Iran and Azerbaijan.
According to the FMD World Reference Laboratory data, FMD is endemic in
Iran; serotypes A and O have been reported there during 2007, and serotype
Asia 1 in 2004. See map at

and Azerbaijan) can be found at
