Elks Infected with Brain Ailment
---------------------------------------
Elk in 3 private, farmed Colorado herds were found to be infected with
a brain ailment called chronic wasting disease and will be destroyed.
One herd is in south-central Colorado, raising concerns the disease
could spread into the state's renowned Western Slope elk and deer
herds. "We simply can't let it get away," said Russell George, director
of the Colorado Division of Wildlife.
The other 2 herds are in the northern part of the state, where the
disease has been present for decades. Chronic wasting disease is a
degenerative disorder that attacks the brains of deer and elk, causing
unsteadiness, excessive slobbering, confusion, and death. All 1000 elk
will be slaughtered and tested for the disease, said Dr. Wayne
Cunningham, a state veterinarian.
State wildlife officials say the transport of elk between ranches has
spread the disease as far away as Saskatchewan, Montana, and South
Dakota. Elk ranchers say their animals were infected by wild deer and
blame the wildlife agency for not eradicating deer between Fort Collins
and Cheyenne, Wyoming, where the outbreak is believed to have
started. Elk are raised for meat and their velvety spring antlers, which
can fetch as much as $70 per pound as a nutritional supplement.

[Would someone with reliable information tell us how many are
eventually found to be infected? This is not to question the decision to
slaughter, just to get a more realistic appreciation of the number seen to
be affected that triggered the events. - Mod.MHJ, JW
