Over 300 000 Indonesians were reported suffering from respiratory illnesses due to worsening haze conditions, the health ministry said on [Tue 6 Oct 2015].

Indonesian Health Minister Nila Moeloek disclosed that the figure of recorded respiratory patients jumped by around 20 percent since the start of the forest fires in Sumatra and Borneo islands in September [2015], pushing the government to take greater measures to terminate the problem in the country, Xinhua news agency reported.

"The number of those suffering from acute respiratory problem has steeply hiked by 15 to 20 percent since 3 weeks ago," she said.

South Sumatra, which has more population than the other 5 Indonesian provinces affected by the haze, recorded the largest number of patients, which stood at 83 276.

Combined, the 6 haze-affected provinces recorded 307 360 cases as of [Mon 5 Oct 2015].

Moeloek said that the ministry has sent tonnes of medicines and thousands of masks to haze-affected areas in the 2 islands. [What kind of medicines? Antihistamines? Asthma type medications? Eye washes? - Mod.TG]

The government has conducted the biggest air operation, involving helicopters, planes, and thousands of soldiers, to stop forest fires that have spread haze to Singapore and Malaysia. But dry weather, the vastness of affected territories and lack of water have hampered the operation.

The government has penalised 4 plantation firms for their involvement in the forest fires.

Indonesia has been battered by such forest fires since the 1990s, as the ensuing haze also engulfs neighbouring Asean countries and causes huge economic losses.

[Smoke can cause serious eye and respiratory irritation. Smoke can carry some toxicants like the spores (or other toxic parts) of poison ivy and related plants. In addition to plant toxins it can carry a variety of chemical products and irritants. Those with allergies and asthma conditions may suffer the worst.

The effects depend on what is burning, on what the smoke/haze particles may be, or may be carrying. At the very least it decreases air quality making it harder to breath and exacerbating asthma, lung conditions, allergies, and potentially even cardiac conditions. The smoke released by any type of fire (forest, brush, crop, or wood burning) is a mixture of particles of carbon-containing materials.

All smoke contains carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and particulate matter (PM or soot). The type and amount of particles and chemicals in smoke vary depending on what is burning, how much oxygen is available, and the burn temperature.

Exposure to high levels of smoke should be avoided. Individuals are advised to limit their physical exertion if exposure to high levels of smoke cannot be avoided. Individuals with cardiovascular or respiratory conditions (such as asthma), fetuses, infants, young children, and the elderly may be more vulnerable to the health effects of smoke exposure.

Inhaling smoke for a short time can cause immediate (acute) effects. Smoke is irritating to the eyes, nose, and throat, and its odor may be nauseating. Studies have shown that some people exposed to heavy smoke have temporary changes in lung function, which makes breathing more difficult. 2 of the major agents in smoke that can cause health effects are carbon monoxide gas and very small particles (fine particles, or PM2.5 ). These particles are 2.5 microns or less in size (25 400 microns = 1 inch; 10 000 microns = 1 cm) and individual particles are too small to be seen with the naked eye.
