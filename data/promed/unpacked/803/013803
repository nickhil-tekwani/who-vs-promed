Death of cattle in Gadap alarms herdsmen
----------------------------------------
At least 50 animals, mostly cows, have died due to a mysterious
disease in different villages of Gadap Town in just 3 days, creating
panic among the local herdsmen.

Salim Memon of the Karachi Rural Network (KRN), representing 40 non
governmental organisations, said that they were collecting the data
about the loss of animals in different villages. He said that, so far,
the herdsmen could not ascertain the exact cause of the death of the
animals.

A Gadap Town official, who was reluctant to be named, told The News
that he has also received information regarding the death of 25 cows
in different villages during the last 24 hours. He stated that there
are 3 veterinary hospitals in the town, including one major hospital
in Gadap city built in 1965, another in Memon Goth and the 3rd one in
Pathan Goth. Apart from this, he said the town had also launched a
mobile veterinary clinic to facilitate the livestock owners in the
villages. The facility of mobile veterinary clinic was active 4 months
back, but now it is inactive. He added that since the staff in
veterinary hospitals was appointed on political basis, they are
reluctant to attend their respective hospitals and are drawing their
monthly salaries. That is why herdsmen are approaching the authorities
for help. He said the herdsmen are unable to take their animals to a
nearby hospital because they die as soon as they are hit by this
strange disease.

A herdsman of Gadap said that he had lost 4 cows and he had never
witnessed this kind of disease before. They fall and die immediately,
he informed this correspondent.

According to the data collected from some of the villages in Gadap
Town, 4 cows have died in Hamzo Gabol Goth, 3 in Khamiso Goth and 7
cows died in Arif Rind Goth. The local herdsmen were of the view that
stagnant water might be the cause of this disease in which animals die
instantly, while others believe that there might be a poisonous insect
in the green grass, which affects the animals.

[The above newswire contains sparse information; the term "poisonous
insect" is rather puzzling. It seems that the mortality is abrupt with
animals not showing clinical signs, but this is in need of
confirmation. Morbidity and mortality rates, ages, husbandry/feeding
data, PM findings and laboratory test results (to exclude anthrax)
would be helpful.
