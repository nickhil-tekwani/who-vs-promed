The [Vermont] State Health Department is reporting that someone contracted hantavirus pulmonary syndrome [HPS] while visiting Vermont last month [August 2014].

The out-of-state resident who became ill was most likely exposed to mice droppings while cleaning up a seasonal home. The person, who was not named, has since recovered.

Hantavirus is a serious respiratory disease that causes fatigue, fever, headaches, muscle aches, coughing, and shortness of breath. Roughly one third of people who get the virus die from it.

State Epidemiologist Erica Berl says it's unusual for hantavirus to be reported in this part of the country, but not unheard of. Vermont's last reported case was in 2000.

Berl says most people are infected by breathing in dust contaminated with rodent droppings. For those who plan to sweep out a garage or tool shed, or open up a hunting camp or trailer that's been closed for a while, Berl recommends airing the area out for half an hour before entering. "And if you do have an infestation," Berl says, "you want to be careful when you clean up the droppings or any nesting material."

Berl advises using a diluted bleach solution and moistening the area before cleaning, to reduce dust.

A 50-year-old San Juan County man was hospitalized with hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, marking New Mexico's 4th case of the viral illness this year [2014], including 2 that resulted in deaths, health officials said today [17 Sep 2014].

New Mexico Department of Health officials will perform an environmental investigation to determine the source of the infection and reduce risk to others.

Hantavirus[es] is [infections cause] a deadly disease transmitted by infected rodents through urine, droppings, or saliva. The deer mouse is the main reservoir for Sin Nombre virus, the hantavirus strain found in New Mexico.

Early symptoms of [Sin Nombre] hantavirus infection include fever and muscle aches, possibly with chills, headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and cough, progressing to respiratory distress. Seek prompt medical attention for symptoms.

"The best defense against hantavirus [infection] is to avoid disturbing areas of rodent infestation, including nests and droppings," said Dr Paul Ettestad, the agency's public health veterinarian.

Air out cabins before entering and wet down rodent dropping with a disinfectant. Trap mice until they are gone and clean up trash around your residence. Seal up holes and cracks in residential buildings to prevent mice from getting inside.

Other cases this year [2014] include a fatal case in a 67-year-old San Juan County woman, a fatal case in a 59-year-old McKinley County man, and a case in a 32-year-old San Juan County woman who survived.

[The Vermont and New Mexico HPS cases are likely caused by different hantaviruses. Although the specific virus involved is not mentioned in the report above, the New York hantavirus is likely responsible for the Vermont case. Its rodent host is the white-footed mouse (_Peromyscus leucopus_).

The hantavirus responsible for the cases in New Mexico is the one mentioned in the report above, Sin Nombre. Its rodent host is the deer mouse (_P. maniculatus_). Precautions to avoid exposure to these viruses are the same for both of them.

An image of _P. leucopus_ can be accessed at http://www.fcps.edu/islandcreekes/ecology/white-footed_mouse.htm, and of _P. maniculatus_ at http://www.gpnc.org/moused.htm.
