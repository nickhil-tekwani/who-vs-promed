Acute Febrile Illness in Eco Challenge Sabah 2000 Expedition Race Participants
---------------------------------------------------------------
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta has preliminary
evidence that the cause of acute febrile illness among participants in the
Eco Challenge Sabah 2000 Expedition Race held in Malaysian Borneo, 20 Aug -
2 Sep 2000, is an infection called leptospirosis.
Leptospirosis is caused by a bacteria, and is usually transmitted to humans
through water contaminated with urine from infected animals. It may take as
long as one month for symptoms of illness to develop among persons infected
with the bacteria responsible for leptospirosis. The most common symptoms
of leptospirosis include fever, chills, red eyes, abdominal discomfort,
vomiting, and diarrhea. In rare instances, severe disease can occur with
damage to the liver, kidneys and lungs. Antibiotics are useful in
prevention and treatment of leptospirosis.
 If you were a participant in the Eco Challenge Sabah 2000 Expedition Race
CDC recommends that you contact your physician about treatment with
appropriate antibiotics.
 If you were a participant in the Eco Challenge Sabah 2000 Expedition Race
and you are not currently ill, CDC recommends that you see your physician
to discuss your possible exposure to the bacteria causing leptospirosis. A
single 200 mg oral dose of doxycycline may be useful in prevention of
leptospirosis if you have not already taken this medicine since the race.
 If your physician diagnosis an illness consistent with leptospirosis CDC
recommends that you receive a 10 day course of oral doxycycline (200 mg
twice per day).
 If you are hospitalized based on your physicians diagnosis with an
illness consistent with leptospirosis, CDC recommends that you be treated
with intravenous penicillin (1.5 million units every 6 hours for 7-10 days).
Infectious agents other than the bacteria causing leptospirosis should be
considered in the evaluation of ill persons who participated in the Eco
Challenge Sabah 2000 Expedition Race.
