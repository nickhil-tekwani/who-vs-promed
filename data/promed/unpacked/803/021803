Bluetongue [BT] has been virtually eradicated from mainland Europe,
figures released by the European Commission indicate.

Tens of thousands of cases of BT, predominantly the BTV8 strain, were
identified across Europe in 2007 [see commentary] and 2008, including
32 000 in France in 2008 alone.

The numbers dropped significantly in 2009 and are on course for a
further significant decline this year [2010].

The latest figures from the European Commission show incidence of BTV
8 has declined to just 2 recorded cases, while cases of other strains
are also on the way down. The breakdown by serotype and member state
for this year [2010] is as follows:

BTV 1: Spain 36 cases, Italy 4, Portugal 2, France 1
BTV 2: Italy 12
BTV 4: Italy 2, Spain 2
BTV 8: Italy 2 (both near French border)
BTV 9: Italy 3
BTV 16: Greece 2

The last recorded case in Britain, other than in imported animals,
was in 2007, after the disease was identified for the 1st time in
eastern England in September of that year.

Scottish livestock organisations welcomed the latest figures and said
that, with continued vigilance, disease-free status for Scotland and
the rest of Britain is a "realistic" goal, while eradication in
Europe is a "distinct possibility."

But representatives of NFU Scotland, the Scottish Beef Cattle
Association, the National Beef Association and the National Sheep
Association renewed their call to Scottish livestock keepers to
maintain their voluntary ban on importing stock from BTV-infected areas.

NFU Scotland's Vice-President, Nigel Miller said the vast reduction
in the number of cases of BTV-8 in Europe was "little short of
miraculous," although he warned that the reporting of the cases "may
not be entirely accurate."

"That said, the future does still look good, and livestock producers
are still emphatically advised to stay safe and import animals only
when it is safe to do so. Scottish livestock keepers are to be
congratulated for continuing to source stock responsibly, and
adhering to the voluntary import ban over the high risk summer period
has been crucial in keeping Scotland disease free. This, and the 2008
Scottish vaccination campaign, plus vaccination throughout much of
the EU, have undoubtedly helped to keep the number of cases down, and
in Scotland's case, at zero. The advice of Scottish stakeholders is
that anyone who feels they must import stock at this time of year
should also follow the Scottish Winter Import Code."

[With dropping temperatures in north and central Europe, the 2010 BT
season is approaching its final stage, and new cases are unlikely to
occur anyway. If the above figures are officially confirmed, the
expressed promising forecast for the disease being eradicated becomes
realistic. This will underline the justification of the disease
control policy adopted, namely a combination of mass vaccination with
restricted animal movements throughout Europe. This suggested
conclusion is still in need of methodical epidemiological analysis.

The major BTV-8 epizootic in Europe, which, reportedly, started in
2006 (if not earlier?!) was unique due to 2 striking characteristics:
species pathogenicity (many cases of clinical disease in cattle,
though, traditionally, BT causes clinical disease mainly or only in
sheep) and geography (BT epizootic starting in northern Europe,
spreading southwards, against all expectations). The source of the
virus and the route and means of introduction remain, so far,
unsolved. - Mod.AS]
