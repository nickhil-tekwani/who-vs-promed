Russia has registered the world's 1st vaccine against COVID-19 for animals, the country's agriculture safety watchdog Rosselkhoznadzor said on Wednesday [31 Mar 2021].

Russia already has 3 coronavirus vaccines for humans, the most well-known of which is Sputnik V, named after Sputnik, the world's 1st satellite launched by the Soviet Union.

The vaccine for animals, developed by a unit of Rosselkhoznadzor, was named Carnivac-Cov, the watchdog said.

"The clinical trials of Carnivac-Cov, which started last October [2020], involved dogs, cats, Arctic foxes, minks, foxes, and other animals," said Rosselkhoznadzor's Deputy Head Konstantin Savenkov. "The results of the trials allow us to conclude that the vaccine is harmless and highly immunogenic, as all the vaccinated animals developed antibodies to the coronavirus in 100% of cases."

Immunity lasts for 6 months after vaccination, but the shot's developers are continuing to analyse this, the watchdog said. Mass production of the vaccine could start as early as April [2021], Rosselkhoznadzor added.

Rosselkhoznadzor said the development of its shot would help prevent mutations in animals and cited Denmark's decision to cull 15 million mink last year [2020], after some were found to be carrying a mutated virus variant.

"The use of the vaccine, according to Russian scientists, can prevent the development of virus mutations," the watchdog said.

It added that animal-breeding facilities and private companies from countries including Greece, Poland, Austria, the United States, Canada, and Singapore had expressed interest in Carnivac-Cov.

Military officials in Russia's 2nd city, Saint Petersburg, announced earlier this week that army dogs would undergo mandatory vaccination before being deployed at airports and participating in nationwide World War II commemorations in May [2021].

[The above Russian publication mentions 5 animal species that have undergone vaccination trials with the candidate vaccine: domestic pets (dogs and cats) and fur animals (minks, Arctic foxes, and foxes). Ferrets (bred commercially or kept as pets) may become candidates for vaccine application as well.

The development of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines for the protection of animals has reportedly been undertaken, in addition to Russia, also in USA and probably in China. Information on its certification and/or field application has not become available.

In China, the strategy of vaccinating minks to prevent them from transmitting SARS-CoV-2 has been presented in a recent paper (Ref 1).

In the USA, the effort has been explained as needed for the protection of commercially farmed minks and preventing the extinction of black-footed ferrets (_Mustela nigripes_), an endangered animal species.
