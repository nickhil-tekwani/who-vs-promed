Citrus to move amid virus cull
--------------------------------
Queensland citrus will be flowing into interstate fruit markets by the
weekend [30-31 Jul 2004], as the Beattie Government prepared to kill
another 30 000 citrus trees on the farm at the center of the bacterial
citrus canker outbreak. Tests have confirmed that the canker disease has
moved, within the 1200 ha Evergreen Farms, from navel oranges to lemons,
bringing the number of trees to be destroyed to 80 000.
Results from more tests of plants on the property are yet to be received,
but Primary Industries Minister Henry Palaszczuk said more trees would be
destroyed if the results were positive. He said there was "absolutely no
evidence" the disease had gone beyond Evergreen Farms, at Emerald, in
central Queensland.
Owned by Filipino millionaire, Philip Cea, Evergreen has been under
quarantine since the end of June 2004, after the disease, which had not
been seen in Australia since 1993, was discovered. Despite allegations, in
2001, that Evergreen had illegally imported budwood into Queensland, the
company has maintained it used only plant material from within Australia.
The discovery of the disease led to all interstate markets closing their
borders on 7 Jul 2004, but, on 21 Jul 2004, the National Consultative
Committee agreed to allow limited citrus to begin moving across the border
from today [22 Jul 2004].

[This is the response to a series of questions that I posed to Chris
Adriaansen, General Manager, Plant Health Biosecurity, Department of
Primary Industries and Fisheries in Queensland, about the current situation
regarding the outbreak of citrus canker at Evergreen Farms in Queensland. -
Mod.DH]
[Question 1: How long will it take to cut down, and burn, the required
number of trees at the Emerald site, and how many trees are destined for
removal?
Answer: "It took us 3 days to copper spray, cut down, and burn, the initial
8000 infested trees. We are now moving through the 600 meter circle around
those, and we anticipate 10 days to spray, carefully cut down, and burn
these (this 600 meters comes from the Florida 1900 feet protocol)."
Question 2: Do roots need to be destroyed too?
Answer: "At this stage, we have advised the property owner of 2 key
infestation sites on the property. When we extend the 600 meter circles
around both of these, we will be taking out a total of some 85 000 trees.
Other infestation locations on the property are yet to be fully confirmed."
Question 3: Does the soil around removed trees need to be sterilized?
Answer: "We are removing stumps after cutting the trees down. This reduces
the on-going problem of rootstock re-growth, and, therefore, reduces the
potential for a re-emergence of the canker in this re-growth, which would
have the effect of re-starting the 2 year "free" time period we are
required to achieve to attain Pest Free Area status."
Question 4: Do roots need to be destroyed too?
Answer: "Root removal is not considered necessary. Citrus are not prolific
in root suckering."
Question 5: Does the soil around removed roots need to be sterilized?
Answer: "Soil sterilization is not considered necessary. As with most
bacterial diseases, ability to survive without living plant material is not
great, and soil infestation is not recorded as a significant source issue
for canker."
Question 6: How many years will it be between replanting and 1st harvest
and full production?
Answer: "We are reviewing the replant period issue. The Australian Citrus
Canker Contingency Plan identifies a period of 2 years between eradication
and 1st possible replant of any canker host. The question we yet have to
resolve is whether that is 2 years after we destroy the diseased material,
or, 2 years after we have declared pest freedom. Given that pest freedom
requires 2 years of clear surveillance after the destruction, if we take
that position, it will be at least 4 to 5 years between infested tree
removal and 1st possible replant. Add to that the juvenile (non-productive)
period of citrus, and you could be looking at 8 years between the last
infested crop and any new one."]
[This report is the 1st detailed revelation about the clean-up activities
at Emerald Farms. The measures undertaken in Australia are similar to those
deployed in the citrus canker eradication program in Florida. This
information should provide a good perspective on the time scale required to
re-establish a new crop of citrus on the property. I sincerely thank Chris
Adriaansen for providing the information. - Mod. DH]
