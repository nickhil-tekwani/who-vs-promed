Agriculture experts have confirmed Washington state's 2nd outbreak of bird flu, this time in a non-commercial flock in Spokane County.

The affected flock is a mix of about 75 geese, chickens, ducks, and guinea fowl which were euthanized. A private veterinarian submitted a dead goose that exhibited unusual behavior prior to death, including walking abnormally, shaking its head, not moving, and exhibiting a lack of fear of humans.

The presence of H5N1 avian influenza virus in the flock was detected by Washington State University's Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory and confirmed by the National Veterinary Services Laboratory on Saturday [7 Apr 2022]. This is the 2nd detection of the virus in Washington state this year [2022], following last week's confirmation in Pacific County, also in a backyard flock. There are no detections in commercial poultry in the state.

Officials said there is no immediate public health concern due to the avian influenza virus detected. Avian influenza does not affect poultry meat or egg products, which remain safe to eat. Avian influenza can be transmitted from wild birds to domestic birds through direct contact, fecal contamination, transmission through the air, environmental contamination, and shared water sources.

District Health Department no. 10 recently announced the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (MDARD) detected the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in a non-commercial backyard poultry flock in Wexford County.

According to MDARD, the Michigan State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory detected the presence in a flock of about 60 birds of various species following an investigation.

HPAI is a form of influenza that is very contagious and can spread in various ways from flock to flock, including by wild birds, through contact with infected poultry, by equipment, and on the clothing and shoes of caretakers. To protect other flocks in Michigan, the birds of the affected flock have been depopulated to prevent disease spread.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), these HPAI detections do not present a major, immediate public health concern. However, recently in Colorado, one person did test positive for avian influenza after working to depopulate poultry infected with HPAI. This highlights the fact that people who have job-related or recreational exposures to infected birds are at higher risk of infection and should take appropriate precautions outlined in CDC guidance.

"The health of our animals is important to our health as well," DHD no. 10 medical director Dr Jennifer Morse. "Infected birds can pass bird flu to people that work or live close to them. It is also possible for bird flu viruses to change and gain the ability to spread easily between people, leading to a flu pandemic. Avian influenza has played a part in all the last four major flu pandemics."

Poultry owners and caretakers are highly encouraged to watch for signs of avian influenza in their flock. This includes unusual deaths, a drop in egg production, a significant decrease in water consumption, or an increase in sick birds. If avian influenza is suspected, they are urged to contact MDARD immediately at the daytime number or the after-hours number. Doing so is not only important for the poultry, but ensures the owner's health and safety.

According to a press release from the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (MDARD), the virus was found in a non-commercial backyard poultry flock containing about 40 birds of various species.

Officials say the premises are under quarantine and the birds will be depopulated to prevent further spread.

"At this time, HPAI continues to mainly be spread through the migration of wild birds. It is important for bird owners to stop this route of transmission by keeping their flocks away from bodies of water wild birds could visit, bringing their flocks indoors, and following other protocols to prevent the virus from being introduced to their birds," State Veterinarian Dr Nora Wineland said in a statement. "Every preventative action that is taken makes an impact. At MDARD, we will continue to swiftly contain this disease and help protect against its spread."

According to the US Department of Agriculture, the virus affected 11 backyard flocks and 820 birds as of 5 May 2022. It was also detected in 38 wild birds.

Whether it's a few backyard birds or a large commercial flock, following a few key steps is fundamental to protecting the health and vitality of Michigan's domestic birds:
- Prevent contact between domestic and wild birds by bringing them indoors or ensuring their outdoor area is fully enclosed.
- Wash your hands before and after handling birds as well as when moving between different coops.
- Disinfecting boots and other gear when moving between coops.
- Do not share equipment or other supplies between coops or other farms.
- Cleaning and disinfecting equipment and other supplies between uses. If it cannot be disinfected, discard it.
- Using well or municipal water as drinking water for birds.
- Keep poultry feed secure to ensure there is no contact between the feed/feed ingredients and wild birds or rodents.
- Reporting possible cases

For domestic birds
------------------
Domestic bird owners and caretakers should watch for unusual deaths, a drop in egg production, a significant decrease in water consumption, or an increase in sick birds. If avian influenza is suspected in domestic birds, contact MDARD immediately;

For wild birds
--------------
If anyone notices what appears to be unusual or unexplained deaths among wild bird populations, please report these cases to the Michigan Department of Natural Resources (DNR) by:
- Using the DNR'sâ€¯Eyes in the Field app. Choose the "Diseased Wildlife" option among the selections for "Observation Forms."
- Calling the DNR Wildlife Disease Laboratory.

[4] Oregon (Linn County), Washington (Pacific County): backyard flocks

Highly pathogenic avian influenza has been identified in Oregon and Washington for the 1st time since 2015, officials in both states said Friday [6 May 2022].

An outbreak in Oregon's Linn County was confirmed Thursday [5 May 2022] in a non-commercial, non-poultry backyard flock with about 160 birds, including geese.

In Washington's Pacific County, the virus was confirmed in a flock of about 50 chickens.

The highly contagious bird flu, known as H5N1, is sweeping across the country, infecting millions of domestic and commercial flocks, as well as wild birds.

The outbreak poses a low health risk to the general public, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says, and poultry and egg products remain safe to eat.

"We knew HPAI was coming our way after a bald eagle in British Columbia [Canada] tested positive in early March [2022]," said Dr Ryan Scholz, state veterinarian for the Oregon Department of Agriculture [ODA].

"Since that detection, we have been hard at work communicating with our commercial poultry producers, veterinarians, and the public on how they can protect their flocks," Scholz said. "Now more than ever, all bird owners must practice good biosecurity, prevent contact between their birds and wild birds and report sick birds or unusual deaths so ODA can ensure testing."

The owner of the Linn County flock reported the deaths and took at least one of the birds to Oregon State University's Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory for testing, according to ODA. Samples also were sent for federal testing.

Meanwhile, ODA quarantined the property and plans to euthanize any additional birds there. It is doing additional surveillance and testing in the nearby area.

The outbreak was first detected in North America in December 2021. To date, it has infected 37 million birds in 32 states, according to the USDA. There have been outbreaks in 171 commercial flocks and 112 backyard flocks.

In a news conference Friday [6 May 2022], health and agriculture officials said this outbreak appears more unusual than those that occurred in 2004-05 and 2014-15.

In 2014-15, the outbreak hit 15 counties in 10 states, and impacted 20 species, said Brian Richards, of the US Geological Survey's National Wildlife Health Center. So far this time, it has hit 216 counties in 32 states and impacted about 60 species.

Previously, there were no mass mortalities in wild birds, Richards said. This time, there have been several, some impacting more than 1000 wild birds.

"The scope vastly surpasses what we saw in 2014-15," Richards said. "There's a lot more virus out there in the environment."

The virus is primarily spread by wild waterfowl that are migrating, officials said. They recommended that flocks be moved indoors and kept away from water sources such as ponds.

Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus continues to sweep across the continent. The number of birds being euthanized or dying from this virus is in the many millions. Clearly, this is impacting the availability of poultry products and resulting in increasing prices on many levels. Wild birds are also being affected.

It is paramount to protect your birds, including our wildlife birds. If you own birds -- even as a small operator -- biosecurity is a very high priority. Live it, breathe it, practice it. - Mod.TG]
