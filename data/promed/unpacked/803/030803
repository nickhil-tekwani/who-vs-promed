A 40-year-old woman from North Sinai Governorate died Wednesday night
[15 Dec 2010] from the H1N1 virus [influenza A/(H1N1) 2009 virus],
commonly known as swine flu, at Ismailia General Hospital, medical
sources confirmed. She was reportedly transferred to the hospital
following a severe lung infection.

The hospital sent her blood samples to the Ministry of Health, which
confirmed the H1N1 infection. She died only hours after being moved to
the quarantine ward.

There is another confirmed case of H1N1 in the hospital, a 35-year-old
woman who is currently receiving treatment, the same source added.

[This death of the woman in the North Sinai governorate of Egypt as a
result of influenza A/(H1N1) 2009 virus infection and another
confirmed case, which follow reports of cases in Israel and Yemen,
confirm that the winter influenza epidemic is now underway in the
Middle East as well as in parts of Europe. In contrast, cases of avian
A/(H5N1) influenza virus infection in Egypt have occurred sporadically
throughout the year and are believed to have been contracted from
diseased domestic poultry with no spread from person to person. The
most recent human avian influenza case occurred in Gharbia governorate
and was recorded on 2 Dec 2010.
