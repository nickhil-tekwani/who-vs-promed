We can confirm that not a single case of autochthonous malaria has been
reported in Havana. All cases reported in the Tropical Institute (IPK)
Bulletin had been imported. Cuba is and continues to be a malaria-free
country since the '60s. The writers and journalists are continuously lying
to try to affect the growing Cuban tourist industry. This is not the first
time they have introduced these kind of lies in ProMED. I don't understand
why ProMED published this press information (not from Cuban press) if the
official bulletin of the Institute of Tropical Medicine only mentioned
imported cases. The number of imported malaria cases is due to the strong
and free help Cuba is giving to many Latin American and African countries.
I will be glad to clarify any doubts or misconceptions regarding this subject.

I am writing in response to Prof Gustavo Kouri's note regarding malaria in
Cuba. In contrast to press reports, he notes the cases registered by the
Tropical Medicine Institute have all been imported. This could not be
avoided, since Cuba counts not only a large number of visitors, but also a
vigorous foreign aid program in which health professional serve in various
countries in Latin America and in Africa. In rural Haiti, where I have
worked for more than 15 years, there are currently more Cuban physicians
than there are Haitian physicians; this has been a great boon to the
Haitian poor.

Years ago, I wrote one letter to ProMED-mail about social inequalities and
"emerging infectious diseases," and received a generous hearing. The
specifics of my point dealt with how the concept of "culture" (in this case
"cultural practices") was used to avoid looking at other issues of great
relevance to emergence of epidemics (namely poverty, social inequalities).
In Prof Kouri's letter, we learn of another example of the importance of
social context in reading reports about malaria. Why is it, exactly, that
the press leaps upon erroneous reports of locally-transmitted malaria in
Cuba while malaria does indeed wreak such havoc on the neighboring island,
Haiti? (We recently had a French guest who visited us in central Haiti and
was told by the leading French epidemiological institute that "there was no
malaria in central Haiti." They must have confused Haiti with Cuba!). Why
is it that when the Bolivian army becomes involved in health promotion
activities their actions are lauded in the international scientific press
as "innovative," whereas having Cuban reservists involved in dengue control
is reported in our journals as "repressive" (I have the references, if
anyone wants them)?

Clearly, these "reports" and "analyses" are embedded in larger ideological
frameworks, and these frameworks are damaging to the Cuban economy and also
to the idea of honest scientific exchange. These erroneous reports also
undermine the near-miraculous fact that Cuba can call itself malaria-free
even though it is so close to Haiti and the Dominican Republic. I am
delighted that Professor Kouri has taken the time to clarify, yet again,
the situation.

[We are happy that there is no malaria in Cuba. ProMED-mail is a service
attempting rapid reporting. A report of malaria in Havana is potentially
important, interesting, and plausible. ProMED-mail has no way of ensuring
that we are not being misused to circulate false rumors, and experience
shows that this is very rare. Professor Kouri should be proud that the
surveillance system in Cuba is so effective that the authorities can
disprove such reports rapidly. - Mod.EP
