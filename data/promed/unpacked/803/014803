Canadian health officials are investigating 2 more deaths as possibly tied to a [listeriosis] outbreak linked to Dole Fresh Vegetables Inc's Springfield, Ohio [USA], plant. Test results in 3 deaths in Canada are not yet conclusive, the Public Health Agency of Canada reported. The outbreak made 11 individuals sick between May 2015 and early January [2016], Canadian officials said.

"Some of the individuals who became ill have reported eating packaged salads. It is suspected that these salads were produced at the Dole facility in Ohio," the Public Health Agency of Canada said in its latest report. "All cases have been hospitalized, and 3 people have died, however it has not been determined if [listeriosis] contributed to the cause of these deaths."

The agency originally attributed one death to the outbreak after Dole reported [21 Jan 2016] to US health officials it had suspended operations at the Ohio plant. On [27 Jan 2016], the company voluntarily recalled all Dole and private-label packaged salads produced there. The US Food and Drug Administration confirmed [28 Jan 2016] the presence of _Listeria monocytogenes_ in a packaged salad produced at the Springfield plant.

The Canadian health agency initially reported 7 people were infected with listeria in 5 provinces, but on [2 Feb 2016] added 4 more cases from Ontario to the total after receiving additional test results.

To date, 15 people from 6 US states have been infected with listeria since [5 Jul 2015] as part of the same outbreak, the Food and Drug Administration reported. All cases led to hospitalization, and one person died in Michigan, US health officials said. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has not disclosed information about the death.

US and Canadian health officials -- citing the ongoing investigation and patient confidentiality -- have not said when information about the deaths might be released.

The Springfield, Ohio plant remains closed while regulatory and company officials continue to investigate the outbreak. Production has been shifted to other Dole processing facilities until the plant is back online, Bil Goldfield, Dole spokesperson, said in a [28 Jan 2016] email. The spokesman said in a recent email that a date for reopening the plant had not been set. When the investigation began, Dole officials were hopeful of reopening the plant in February [2016]. Dole's primary concern is always the health and safety of its consumers, Goldfield said in an email.

Recalled brands of packaged salads include Dole, Fresh Selections, Simple Truth, Marketside, The Little Salad Bar, and President's Choice. Packaged salad products being recalled are identified with a product code beginning with the letter "A" in the upper right-hand corner of the package, according to a Dole news release.
