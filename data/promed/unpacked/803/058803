At least 22 people have become ill after eating raw oysters in
Washington State according to a Thu 4 Aug 2011 Washington State
Department of Health (WSDH) news release. The illnesses, caused by the
bacterium _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_, have been connected to both raw
oysters from commercial harvesting (18) and recreational harvesting
(4).

The WSDH offers the following steps to avoid vibriosis:
- Put oysters on ice or refrigerate them as soon as possible after
harvest.
- If a receding tide has exposed oysters for a long time, don't
harvest them.
- Always cook oysters thoroughly. Cooking oysters at 145 F for 15
seconds destroys vibrio bacteria.
- Rinsing fully-cooked oysters with seawater can re-contaminate them.
- For commercial harvesters, special control measures are in place
from May through September to keep people from getting sick if they
eat raw oysters.
- Shellfish companies must quickly refrigerate oysters after they're
harvested. They're required to keep detailed harvest and temperature
control records to show that the oysters were handled properly.

[It is important to stress that _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_ is naturally
present in marine waters and does not imply sewage contamination, as
would be the case with _Salmonella_ sp. or _E. coli_. It is most
common in warmer waters such as those of the American Gulf Coast, but
warmer waters in more northern climates can also be associated with
oyster-associated _V. parahaemolyticus_.

In 2005, a New England Journal of Medicine report highlighted this
infection linked to even Alaskan oysters:

McLaughlin, JB, DePaola A, Bopp CA, et al: Outbreak of _Vibrio
parahaemolyticus_ Gastroenteritis Associated with Alaskan Oysters. N
Engl J Med 2005; 353: 1463-70 (full article available at
http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa051594).

"Abstract
---------
Background: _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_, the leading cause of
seafood-associated gastroenteritis in the USA, typically is associated
with the consumption of raw oysters gathered from warm water
estuaries. We describe a recognized outbreak of _V. parahaemolyticus_
infection associated with the consumption of seafood from Alaska.

Methods: After we received reports of the occurrence of
gastroenteritis on a cruise ship, we conducted a retrospective cohort
study among passengers, as well as active surveillance throughout
Alaska to identify additional cases, and an environmental study to
identify sources of _V. parahaemolyticus_ and contributors to the
outbreak.

Results: Of 189 passengers, 132 (70 percent) were interviewed; 22 of
the interviewees (17 percent) met our case definition of
gastroenteritis. In our multiple logistic-regression analysis,
consumption of raw oysters was the only significant predictor of
illness; the attack rate among people who consumed oysters was 29
percent. Active surveillance identified a total of 62 patients with
gastroenteritis. _V. parahaemolyticus_ serotype O6:K18 was isolated
from the majority of patients tested and from environmental samples of
oysters. Patterns on pulsed-field gel electrophoresis were highly
related across clinical and oyster isolates. All oysters associated
with the outbreak were harvested when mean daily water temperatures
exceeded 15.0 C (59 F) (the theorized threshold for the risk of _V.
parahaemolyticus_ illness from the consumption of raw oysters). Since
1997, mean water temperatures in July and August at the implicated
oyster farm increased 0.21 C per year (P less than 0.001 by linear
regression); 2004 was the only year during which mean daily
temperatures in July and August 2004 at the shellfish farm did not
drop below 15.0 C (59 F).

Conclusions: This investigation extends by 1000 km (621 miles) the
northernmost documented source of oysters that caused illness due to
_V. parahaemolyticus_. Rising temperatures of ocean water seem to have
contributed to one of the largest known outbreaks of _V.
parahaemolyticus_ in the USA." - Mod.LL]
