In Gorakhpur, 4 more persons have died of encephalitis here, taking
the number of victims claimed by the disease in Uttar Pradesh's
eastern region this year to 219, a health official today said. All the
4 deaths occurred at BRD Medical College Hospital here during the past
2 days, Additional Director (Health) U K Srivastava said.

The dead included one each from Gorakhpur, Deoria and Kushinagar
districts of UP and one from neighbouring state Bihar, he said.
Meanwhile, 45 new encephalitis patients have been admitted in
different hospitals of the region.

Out of a total of 219 deaths due to the disease this year, 208
occurred at BRD Medical College Hospital alone, he said.

The number of fatal encephalitis cases in the region continues to
slowly, but steadily climb, increasing from 215 on 28 Aug 2010 to 219
today (31 Aug 2010). The etiology of these new infections is not
given, but presumably some are due to Japanese encephalitis virus.
