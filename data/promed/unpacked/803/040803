Brucellosis, foot and mouth controlled in Kanchanaburi
--------------------------------------------------
Thousands of animals tested
Hundreds of cattle in Tha Maka district have been found to have foot and
mouth disease, while 22 goats were diagnosed with brucellosis and destroyed
to prevent the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, it was reported that 40 people in nearby Ratchaburi province
were infected with brucellosis, a bacterial disease caught from animals,
and about 250 infected goats had been destroyed. The disease was believed
to have been spread by the consumption of raw milk or meat from infected goats.
Suwut Chalayjorn, provincial livestock office chief, said 22 of 42 ill
goats in Kanchanaburi were diagnosed with brucellosis. They were killed and
buried on 22 Aug 2003 and the owners compensated at the market price of 50
baht [less than USD 1.25] per kilogramme of meat. All 10 760 goats in
Kanchanaburi's 10 districts were being tested, he said.
He said foot and mouth disease had spread in Tha Maka district, where
200-300 cattle, including about 40 milk cows, were found to be infected on
25 Jul 2003. The animals were vaccinated and the outbreak brought under
control, he said.

[We had trouble in deciding on a suitable title for such a mixed report,
but FMD was listed first, as it is a more important problem than
brucellosis. Thailand reported extensive outbreaks of FMD in 2001 and 2000.
