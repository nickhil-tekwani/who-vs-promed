Measles resurgence in France in 2008, a preliminary report
----------------------------------------------------------

Health Surveillance; 2 Claude Bernard Lyon 1 University, Chairman of the
French working group on measles and congenital rubella elimination

Since the beginning of 2008, France has been experiencing a resurgence of
measles. It started in a religious traditionalist group with low coverage
and secondarily spread to the general population. This situation is the
consequence of insufficient vaccine coverage (less than 90 per cent at 24
months of age), which had led to the accumulation of susceptibles over the
last years. More than 550 cases have been notified in 2008, the vast
majority being unvaccinated. One measles-related death has occurred early
in 2009. Efforts to enhance communication to the general public and health
professionals on measles vaccination and control measures around cases are
ongoing.

Introduction
Since the beginning of 2008, France has been facing an increase of measles
incidence. To date, 579 cases were reported in 2008 through mandatory
notification, whereas in 2006 and 2007 the numbers of reported cases were
40 and 44, respectively.

Mandatory notification of measles was reintroduced in July 2005 as part of
the National Plan for Elimination of Measles and Congenital Rubella.
Physicians and microbiologists have to report suspected measles cases
without delay to the local Public Health Officer [1]. Laboratory
confirmation is strongly recommended for sporadic cases, either through
serum or salivary testing. Oral fluid samples (for IgM detection and PCR)
are sent to the National Reference Laboratory, which also performs
genotyping of the circulating viruses (5-10 cases should be sampled when a
localised outbreak is investigated). Notification forms are collected and
analysed centrally at the InVS.

The current measles vaccination strategy consists of 2 doses of
measles-mumps-rubella vaccine (MMR) to be administered before the age of 2
years, the 1st one at 12 months of age and the 2nd one between 13 and 24
months of age. A catch-up with 2 doses is recommended for children born
after 1991 and with one dose for subjects born between 1980 and 1991.

Outbreak description
The ongoing outbreak began in spring 2008 with several clusters. The more
important were reported in Burgundy and northern regions of France. A total
of 110 cases were identified among elementary and secondary students of 2
private religious schools and their siblings. The index case was a 10 year
old Swiss girl who had been in contact with a measles case in Austria in
mid-April [2008] [2-4]. Since summer 2008, other clusters and outbreaks
have been reported, with an upsurge of measles cases in October 2008 and a
peak in November 2008 (131 cases). Virus transmission is still ongoing,
with 80 cases reported in January 2009 [data presented as a figure in the
original test].

Despite the fact that most of the outbreaks were initially linked to
schools affiliated with the same religious group as in Burgundy, in several
regions, the virus is currently circulating in the community, and outbreaks
in both private and public schools have been reported. The most affected
regions are in the northwest and southeast [data presented as a figure in
the original text].

More than half (55 per cent) of the cases reported in 2008 have been
confirmed either by detecting measles IgM antibodies or viral RNA by RT-PCR
(265 cases) or by an epidemiological link with laboratory-confirmed cases
(54 cases). However, the proportion of laboratory-confirmed cases decreased
from an average of 71 percent between January and July 2008 to an average
of 38 per cent between August and December 2008. Preliminary results from
the National Reference Laboratory showed that 3 main genotypes were
co-circulating: D5, D8, and D4, the predominant one being D5. The median
age of the 579 cases reported in 2008 was 12 years (range: 0-56 years).
1/3rd of the cases were aged 15 years or above [data presented as a table
in the original text]. Amongst the 26 cases less than one year old, 13 were
aged between 3 and 9 months (8 were laboratory-confirmed).

Vaccination status was known for 548 cases (95 per cent). Among these, the
proportion of unvaccinated cases was 88.5 per cent [data presented as a
figure in the original text]. Of the 63 vaccinated cases, 51 were
vaccinated with one dose (9 per cent), 11 with 2 doses (2 per cent), and
for one case, the number of doses was unknown.

Complications
Hospitalisation was required for 110 patients (19 per cent) according to
the notification forms received in 2008. Among these cases, 18 were
diagnosed with pneumonia, but no encephalitis was reported. Unfortunately,
one unvaccinated French 12 year old girl died in January 2009 in Geneva
University Hospital from acute measles encephalitis.

Control measures
Several control measures were implemented by local health authorities
according to national guidelines. They include general information to the
public, targeted information to health professionals covering the affected
area, and specific recommendations to pupils' parents, the schools and the
involved religious community administration where clusters are identified.
The main recommendations are to undergo vaccination according to the
national immunisation schedule and to propose post-exposure vaccination or
immunoglobulin depending on age, time since exposure and existence of risk
factors of severe measles [1].

Discussion
Although measles incidence rates in 2006 and 2007 were below 0.1 per 100
000 inhabitants, suggesting near elimination, the current measles
resurgence is not unexpected in the context of the still insufficient
measles vaccination coverage allowing for silent accumulation of
susceptibles. Current coverage at 24 months of age with at least one dose
is estimated to be between 87-90 per cent [InVS, unpublished data]. A
survey carried out in 2005 has shown a coverage at 11 years of age of 96
per cent for at least one dose of MMR through catch-up vaccination beyond 2
years and a coverage for the 2nd dose of 74 per cent [5].

The data available through the routine notification system underestimate
the actual measles incidence. During outbreak investigations, up to 10
times more cases have been identified than those notified to the local
health authorities. This is the consequence of both the absence of medical
consultation for a large proportion of the cases (especially when several
cases occur within the same family) and the insufficient knowledge or
motivation of some doctors regarding the notification procedure.

The current measles virus circulation in the community has been triggered
by the clustered measles susceptibility in children belonging to
traditionalist religious groups where measles vaccination coverage is low.
The fact that these children often share the same schools and leisure
activities such as summer camps have lead to several outbreaks in this
group and to the secondary spread of the virus outside of this community.
Efforts have been undertaken by the Ministry of Health to speak with
representatives of the religious community regarding this specific measles
vaccination issue.

The contribution of groups with low vaccination coverage due either to
geographical or financial difficulties in accessing vaccination services or
a reluctance toward measles vaccination for religious or philosophical
reasons have been identified as major impediments to achieving measles
elimination in Europe [6-8].

In France, there are virtually no geographical or financial impediments to
receiving the vaccine. The network of both private practitioners and public
health clinics ensures optimal geographical access to measles vaccination.
Furthermore, measles-containing vaccines are the only vaccines offered
totally free of charge for children up to 13 years of age. If elimination
in France is to be reached, the priority, therefore, lies in maintaining
efforts to persuade as many parents and health professionals reluctant
about measles vaccination as possible to use the vaccine. In the context of
the current measles situation, communication to the general public and
health professionals has, therefore, been strengthened, amplified by the
media attention drawn by the recent measles-related death case.
