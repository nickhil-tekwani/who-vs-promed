Date: 31 Mar 2014
Subject: Infectious Diseases of Bats Symposium http://www.batid.org/
Location: Fort Collins, Colorado, USA
Venue: Lory Student Center, Colorado State University
Dates: 26-27 Jun 2014


Bats host hundreds of infectious agents, many of which are known to impact human and veterinary health. Bats also are susceptible to many infectious diseases. This symposium will focus on the relationships of bats and the infectious agents for which they serve as hosts, the zoonotic cycles and ecology of bat-borne infectious agents, the molecular mechanisms of immune evasion and pathogenesis, and the clinical manifestations of human and veterinary diseases caused by infectious agents transmitted by bats. The symposium will immediately follow the annual meeting of the American Society for Virology, which also will be held at Colorado State University.

Registration and abstract submission are now open. For more information and the preliminary program, please visit the symposium's web page, or email <tony.schountz@colostate.edu>.
