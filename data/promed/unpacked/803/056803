The NPPO of Israel recently informed EPPO of the first report of 'Candidatus Liberibacter solanacearum' (the potato haplotypes are listed in the EPPO A1 List) on its territory.

'Ca. L. solanacearum' was detected in commercial fields of carrot (_Daucus carota_ cvs 'Nairobi', 'Maestro', 'Dordogne') in Northern and Southern Israel. The pathogen was identified in symptomatic carrot plants by both classical and real-time PCR assays. In addition, sequencing confirmed the identity of 'Ca. L. solanacearum' and determined that the haplotype present was haplotype D which infects Apiaceae only. 'Ca. L. solanacearum was also identified in specimens of its psyllid vector, _Bactericera trigonica_, collected from the field. No specific phytosanitary measures were taken.

'Candidatus Liberibacter solanacearum' is officially declared as present in all parts where [the] host crop is grown.

[Only a few members of _Candidatus_ Liberibacter have been characterised so far, including the pathogens causing citrus greening (huanglongbing, HLB; for more information see previous ProMED-mail posts in the archives). HLB, one of the most damaging diseases of citrus, is limited to these crops due to the host specificity of its vector, the citrus psyllid.

A new liberibacter species was found to be associated with zebra chip (ZC) and psyllid yellows (PY) diseases of potato, as well as a new yellowing disease of tomato and capsicum crops in New Zealand. The new pathogen was given the preliminary name of _Ca._ Liberibacter solanacearum (Lso; synonym _Ca._ L. psyllaurous). Lso has since also been associated with yellowing diseases of other solanaceous crops (physalis, tomatillo, aubergine, tamarillo, tobacco) and some crops in the family Apiaceae (carrot, celery). Main vectors of Lso are the potato psyllid (_Bactericera cockerelli_) in solanaceous host and carrot psyllids (_Trioza apicalis_, _Bactericera trigonica_) in Apiaceae. These vectors have a much wider host range than the HLB vector and additional vector species are also being identified, further extending potential host range and economic impact of Lso.

Currently the Lso species is divided into 4 haplotypes: A & B affecting Solanaceae, C & D affecting Apiaceae. Both groups of haplotypes have been reported from the Americas and New Zealand. Carrot haplotypes have previously been reported from several European countries (ProMED-mail posts 20120713.1199961, 20151009.3702151 & 20161130.4666613) and northern Africa (ProMED-mail post 20141121.2978030), but the item above appears to be its first report in the Middle East area. Potato haplotypes are still considered absent from the European/Mediterranean region.
