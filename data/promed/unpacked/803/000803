Chief Medical Officer Dr. Rawle Edwards said that the Health Ministry was
very concerned, as there had been a tremendous increase in the incidence of
the dengue fever and a large number of deaths.
So far in 1998, there have been 2,400 reported cases of dengue fever, 97 of
which were of the more fatal dengue haemorrhagic fever. There have been 15
related deaths so far this year. Dengue fever is [caused by one of four
viruses carried by _Aedes aegypti_ [and other peridomestic] mosquitoes.
