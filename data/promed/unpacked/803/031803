Yellow fever has claimed the lives of 7 people in Isiolo since [12 Jan 2022] when the first cases were detected. Residents have been asked to use treated mosquito nets and clear bushes in their villages to prevent transmission of the disease. Symptoms of the disease include fever, headache, nausea, vomiting and fatigue.

Isiolo County public health director, Mr Guracha Sarite, said the health department had in the last month carried out 61 tests out of which 53 were found to be highly suspicious and were subjected to further tests, where 8 cases were confirmed. He said 3 suspected cases had been reported in Bulapesa and Burat neighbouring Isiolo town, saying they suspect the 3 traveled from lower areas of Ewaso Nyiro River which are the most affected.

The Ministry of Health last month declared an outbreak in the county after the disease claimed 3 lives in Garbatulla. The government put Wajir, Garissa, Meru, Samburu, Baringo and Turkana counties on high alert.

"We are not out of danger yet and appeal to our people in the lower areas to clear bushes in their neighbourhoods and use treated nets to prevent further transmission," Mr Sarite said. He said the county government has activated an emergency response and will soon roll out a fumigation exercise in the affected areas to get rid of mosquitoes.

[Yellow fever (YF) virus transmission is continuing in Isiolo county, although at a low level. During the period 12 Jan-15 Mar 2022, there was a total of 53 suspected yellow fever cases, including 6 deaths. Now the number of deaths is 7. The emergency response mentioned in the above report does not mention vaccination. Although attempts at vector control and avoidance of mosquito bites that are mentioned in the report are prudent, vaccination is more effective at preventing YF virus transmission. - Mod.TY
