Molecular typing of patient isolates show that the outbreak of severe infection with Group B streptococcus (GBS) in Singapore earlier this year [2015] was due to a clone belonging to serotype III and multilocus sequence type (MLST) ST283. This is an uncommon clone [that] has previously been associated with invasive disease in non-pregnant adults, but was not present in the genital tracts of pregnant mothers in Hong Kong from 1993-2003 [1].

ST283 GBS have also been isolated from fish (tilapia) from Thailand and the zoonotic potential of this clone has been suggested before [2]. While attempts to isolate GBS from fish samples in Singapore at the time of the outbreak were unsuccessful, some samples were PCR positive for serotype III GBS. MLST performed on the DNA extract yielded sequences consistent with ST283.

Since the Ministry of Health/National Environmental Agency advisory to stop sales of raw fish dishes using bighead carp and toman [or snakehead] on 24 Jul 2015, the cases of severe GBS disease have fallen back to baseline (http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/cases-related-to-gbs-infections-fall-after-curb-on-raw-fish-sales-moh).

An isolate from the outbreak has been sequenced and the sequence can be found on Genbank under the accession number CP012419 (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/CP012419) [3].

[Group B streptococci (GBS), also called _Streptococcus agalactiae_, are Gram-positive cocci that produce beta-hemolysis when cultured on sheep blood agar. They are classified into several serotypes based on the antigenic specificity of their capsular polysaccharide. GBS colonize the vagina and gastrointestinal tract in healthy women, with carriage rates ranging from 15-45 percent and can cause chorioamnionitis, post-partum endometritis, and sepsis in pregnant women and pneumonia, sepsis, and meningitis in newborns following vaginal delivery in mothers with vaginal GBS colonization at the time of delivery.

GBS have been found to colonize the urethra in both men and women and can also colonize the gastrointestinal tract and upper respiratory tract; they are increasingly recognized as an invasive pathogen in diabetics and the elderly, causing sepsis, pneumonia, skin and soft-tissue infection (such as, decubitus ulcers and diabetic foot infections), urinary tract infections, endocarditis, septic arthritis, osteomyelitis, meningitis, peritonitis, and endophthalmitis (http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/41/6/839.long).

GBS are also found in other animals including fish, cattle, horses, dogs, rabbits, guinea pigs, and mice. The strains that cause disease in humans, however, were said to be usually biochemically, metabolically or serologically different from strains that cause disease in other animals (http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/streptococcosis.pdf). However, GBS MLST ST-283, serotype III-4 has been detected both in fish and in adult humans with invasive GBS diseases in Southeast Asia, which suggested that there may be an epidemiological connection between the 2 host species, as previously described for a closely related streptococcal species, _Streptococcus iniae_ (http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/13/41).

Prior ProMED-mail posts (Strep. Group B - Singapore: foodborne susp. RFI 20150715.3513331 and Strep. Group B - Singapore (02): fish susp, RFI 20150814.3577512) reported an outbreak of GBS infections in Singapore that was linked to consumption of GBS-contaminated raw fish in "yusheng", a popular dish at hawker centers (food courts), where raw fish is marinated in sesame oil and garnished with red chili and ginger.

Dr Koh at Singapore General Hospital now reports above that the molecular analysis of GBS detected by PCR in raw fish in Singapore was similar to the clone belonging to GBS serotype III and MLST ST283 isolated from patients with invasive GBS infection in Singapore earlier this year (2015).

Dr Koh has nicely described online the investigation of this outbreak that I recommend for your reading, available at http://10minus6cosm.tumblr.com/post/132590510556/serious-group-b-streptococcal-infection-in-adults.

ProMED-mail greatly appreciates Dr Koh's submission. - Mod.ML
