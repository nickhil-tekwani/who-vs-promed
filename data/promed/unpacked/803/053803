Mange epidemic in vicunas
-------------------------
Vicunas in Pampa Galeras [Reserve, in Ayacucho province, Lucanas region] are in peril, according to Juan Martinez Madueno, the director of Lucanas Agriculture Agency, who pointed out that mange is increasing in these animals, a symbol of the Peruvian richness.

"Two days ago (10 Oct 2012) we found more than 20 animals with mange out of 300 captured in Pampas Galeras. This is worrisome because the contagion is almost immediate," Martinez said. He added that during the survey they found around 15 dead vicunas.

The ministry of agriculture is the main responsible for the control of epidemics, said Martinez, "nonetheless, very little has been done since the disease emerged more than 6 years ago."

It is noteworthy that the death of a vicuna means a USD 1000 loss.

[Guanacos and vicunas are the 2 wild South American camelids. Llamas and alpacas are, respectively, the domestic species that originated from them. A picture of a vicuna can be seen at http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7c/Vicu%C3%B1a_-_Chimborazo%2C_Ecuador.jpg.

The Vicuna Reserve of Pampas Galeras houses roughly 70 percent of vicunas in the world.

The most common mange mite in South American camelids is _Sarcoptes scabiei_ var. _aucheniae_. The lesions caused by these mites are observed in regions of little fur, like between toes, thighs, chest, face, and ears. In wild populations, mange usually occurs at low prevalence levels. A more widespread occurrence might indicate an underlying poor condition.
