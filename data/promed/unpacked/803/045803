An animal disease surveillance program has found elk that have been exposed to brucellosis in an area of southwest Montana where infections previously had not been documented.

State Veterinarian Marty Zaluski said Tuesday [18 Mar 2014] that 10 of 60 elk captured in an area along the Madison River west of Belgrade tested positive for exposure to the disease. Tests on 70 elk from a 2nd area, the Tobacco Root Mountains, found no evidence of infection.

Brucellosis can cause pregnant animals to prematurely abort. It has been widely eradicated in livestock but persists in elk, bison and other wildlife in and around Yellowstone National Park.

Zaluski says authorities anticipated the disease would turn up in the area where it was found and have been working with ranchers to make sure cattle are tested.

[Bovine brucellosis (caused by _Brucella abortus_) has caused devastating losses to farmers in the United States over the last century. Collaborative efforts by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the livestock industries, and state animal health authorities achieved brucellosis-free status in 48 states with no known infection since 2002.

The only known focus of _Brucella abortus_ infection left in the nation is in bison and elk, which originally acquired the infection from cattle. The bacterium became established in these wildlife species and does not currently pose a threat for their populations. However, it does represent a big concern for domestic livestock.
