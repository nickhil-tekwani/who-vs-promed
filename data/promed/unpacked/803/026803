Aedes albopictus: 1st record from Spain
---------------------------------------
Specialists in the mosquito control service have detected a mosquito
of Asiatic origin in Sant Cugat del Valles (Barcelona). Although its
bite is very painful, the mosquito does not present a threat to
public health, according to the specialists. The name of the mosquito
is _Aedes albopictus_, an Asiatic mosquito that has also been found
in other regions of southern Europe. The extent of the spread of the
mosquito in Sant Cugat, and in other areas of Catalonia, is not yet
known, but, is being investigated.

[This is the 1st report of _Aedes albopictus_ from Spain. This is a
Southeast Asian mosquito (vector of dengue in Asia) that has, through
commerce -- mainly through the shipment of tires -- been introduced
into at least 20 countries outside of Asia. Its 1st appearance in
Europe was in Albania in 1979, followed by Italy in 1990, France in
1998, Belgium in 2000, and now, Spain. In Italy, _Ae. albopictus_ has
become well-established in some localities, but, it has not, I
understand, become established in Belgium. It will, of course, be
interesting to see whether it persists, or spreads, in Spain. The
record from Belgium is of particular interest, because it is a
European country that has a cooler climate than other European
countries invaded by the mosquito, suggesting that _Ae. albopictus_
might enter countries such as the Netherlands and the UK. (See
Schaffner, F., Bortel, W, van and Coosemans, M. (2004) First record
of _Aedes (Stegomyia) albopictus_ in Belgium. _Journal of the
American Mosquito Control Association, 20, 201-203).
Although I agree with the statement that _Ae. albopictus_ does not
currently present a public health problem in Spain, it should be
remembered that this mosquito is a known vector of several
arboviruses and filarial worms, and, might support transmission in
Europe of Tahyna virus, and _Dirofilaria_ species, to animals and
humans (see Guillet. P. and Nathan, M. (1999) _Aedes albopictus_, une
menace pour la France? Medicine Tropicale 59 (Supplement); 49-52). -
