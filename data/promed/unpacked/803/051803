Bird flu outbreak in China's Hunan province
-----------------------------------------------
China has reported deadly bird flu in chickens and ducks in a village in
the central province of Hunan, on the heels of another outbreak in the east
of the country, and declared it had been brought under control.
China notified the United Nations of the latest outbreak in Xiangtan County
-- near the provincial capital, Changsha -- on Tuesday [25 Oct 2005],
according to a notice on the Web site of the World Organisation for Animal
Health
<http://www.oie.int>.
[OIE is not a UN agency; it is an independent international organization,
established in 1927; its headquarters is located in Paris. - Mod.AS]
The World Health Organization [WHO] has said the H5N1 strain of bird flu is
endemic in poultry in China and across much of Asia, and it could only be a
matter of time before it develops the ability to pass easily from human to
human.
China has reported no human cases so far.
An Agriculture Ministry official in Beijing confirmed the Hunan outbreak
but gave no details. The notice said that 687 chickens and ducks showed
signs of illness, 545 had died, and a total of 2487 birds were culled in
the outbreak in Hunan county, also famous in China as Mao Zedong's birthplace.
"The outbreak has been effectively controlled," the Agriculture Daily
newspaper said, quoting the national bird flu laboratory as saying it had
identified the strain as the deadly H5N1.
On Tuesday [25 Oct 2005], China reported another outbreak among farm geese
in the eastern province of Anhui and said that it too had been brought
under control with no reported human infections.
China had also notified Hong Kong of the outbreak, the government said. The
former British colony, which reverted to Chinese sovereignty in 1997, gets
much of its food from the neighboring southern Chinese province of
Guangdong, which borders Hunan.
Hong Kong does not currently buy any poultry meat or live birds from Hunan
but will bar any such imports from the province as a precaution, the
government added.
"We will monitor the development of the situation in the coming weeks," the
government said.
There have been other recent outbreaks in far-western Xinjiang, Qinghai and
in northern Inner Mongolia.

China's sheer size and its attempts to conceal the emergence of the SARS
virus in 2003 have prompted fears among some experts that it has had more
bird flu cases than officially recorded.
But experts and U.N. officials have said they believe China is better
prepared and more open than in 2003.

[Indeed, China seems to have commendably improved its transparency. The new
outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza, sub-type H5, in Hunan has
been reported by China's National Chief Veterinary Officer to the OIE in a
follow-up report No 5, dated 25 Oct 2005, one day after the previous
notification on an outbreak in Anhui. The location of the new focus is the
village Wantang in Xiangtan County. [See map
<http://www.fallingrain.com/world/CH/11/Wantang.html>].
The outbreak involved chickens and ducks; it started on 22 Oct 2005 and was
confirmed by the laboratory on 25 Oct 2005. Diagnosis was based upon HI,
RT-PCR and IPVI tests carried out by the National Avian Influenza Reference
Laboratory, Harbin Veterinary Research Institute. Out of 687 susceptible
birds, 545 died; 2487 birds have subsequently been destroyed. In response
to the outbreak, 43 750 avians have been vaccinated with an inactivated
mono H5N2 vaccine. See the full report at

[2] Germany (Rhineland-Palatinate), wild goose, suspected

A ban on the import of all captive birds from around the world plus a ban
on all bird fairs, exhibitions and shows to protect Britain and Europe from
the deadly avian flu virus is to be in place within 24 hours.
News of the tough new controls emerged as the EU food safety agency warned
consumers to avoid raw eggs and to cook poultry thoroughly. Herman Koeter,
the agency's deputy chief, said last night [25 Oct 2005] that the
possibility of the virus being transmitted through food could not be
discounted.
Signs of the virus were found yesterday [25 Oct 2005] in 2 dead migratory
birds at a lake in Neuwied in Germany, although the bodies of another 23
birds found at the same location did not contain any traces. [See map
<http://www.fallingrain.com/world/GM/8/Neuwied.html>].
Further tests are needed to confirm the deadly strain, but the discovery
provoked alarm throughout the EU. If positive, it would bring the disease
in migratory birds to the heart of the European mainland. Many EU states
last night [25 Oct 2005] were poised to follow the action of the French and
order all poultry and game birds to be locked indoors.
The order applies to farms in 21 French departments to protect them from
the threat of migratory birds. Hunters were also banned from using live
birds as bait amid fears of contact with migratory birds. There was no sign
yet that the British Government would do the same.
Margaret Beckett, the Rural Affairs Secretary, is to make a statement to
the Commons today [26 Oct 2005] to outline the emergency measures being
introduced throughout the country and the European Union.
This includes a ban on the commercial import of exotic birds, such as
parrots, as pets. These were considered the main threat of carrying the
disease, because 232 000 exotic pets and birds have been brought into the
EU in the past 3 months.
EU veterinary experts believe the threat of the spread of the flu virus via
bird imports is greater than the threat posed from a black market in wild
captive birds.
Ministers have allowed individuals to import exotic birds to keep as pets.
They will be subject to strict rules, and each owner will be restricted to
a maximum of 5 birds. The birds must also pass veterinary health checks and
have spent 21 days in quarantine before leaving the country of export.
The bans on trade and bird gatherings are being introduced as a temporary
measure to ensure there is no risk of avian flu spreading after the 1st
case of the virus found in a parrot from Suriname, which mingled with birds
from Taiwan at an Essex quarantine station. If the parrot had not died in
quarantine last week [3rd week October 2005], the bird consignments would
have been allowed on general sale in pet shops today, 30 days after they
were allowed to mix, according to dates disclosed by the Department for
Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra).
The precise chain of events remains muddled, and it is clear government
vets are not yet certain about the facts. They are also still trying to
ascertain whether the virus was at the quarantine center before the arrival
of the birds from Suriname, and also which bird became infected 1st. It was
also unclear last night [25 Oct 2005] whether experts at the Veterinary
Laboratory Agency conducting the tests had the necessary tissue samples
from all the birds in question.
It emerged yesterday [25 Oct 2005] that staff at the Pegasus shop were
expecting a delivery of orange-winged Amazons, believed to be the species
of the infected parrot. Another Essex bird trader said she had been
promised they would be available this month.
The 1st casualty of the ban on bird gatherings is this weekend's
Countryside Live Fair at the Great Yorkshire Showground in Harrogate, where
the poultry and pigeon section was cancelled after a ruling from Fred
Landeg, the Government's deputy chief veterinary officer. About 1500 birds
had been expected at the event. In anticipation of a ban, Phil Carcass,
chairman of the East Midland Bird Breeders Association, also cancelled the
annual gathering for about 3000 birds at the Newark Showground due next
week. The move will please animal welfare groups who have been fighting for
a ban on wild captive birds, as well as poultry farmers who are anxious to
safeguard their livelihoods.
The new measures to protect Europe were agreed to, as ministers considered
a new outbreak of avian flu in China and a 4th death in Indonesia.

[Under normal circumstances, the detection of antibodies against an
(hitherto undefined) avian influenza in 2 out of 23 dead "migratory birds"
(according to other media sources, wild geese) anywhere would not be
regarded as exceptional or alarming. Obviously, ours are different times.
We are anticipating receiving the final lab results as soon as possible. -
