>>The lack of disease due to VT1-producing _E. coli_ in farm residents in
this study may reflect protection associated with antibodies induced by
previous exposure.<<
Since I believe that vaccines against these pathogens are under
development, does this suggest that they ought to be more broad spectrum
than one might have envisaged?
>>Urban residents who visit farms, have direct contact with cattle, or
consume unpasteurized milk may be expected to have a higher risk of VTEC
infection and disease due to less prior exposure to VTEC.<<
One can of course look at it the other way round and suggest that urban
residents who visit farms ..... might be expected to have come into contact
to VTEC organisms and may thus be protected from subsequent infection.
>>In addition, children with declining maternal immunity, <<
If so, then you should see high levels of clinical VTEC infection in this
group of rural children and it should already be documented. I presume that
it is not observed since those performing this work would be best placed to
have access to such statistics.
>>the elderly, <<
and similarly for elderly *rural* dwellers. These have been (as far as I
can tell from news reports) singularly absent from the statistics in the UK.
>>and other immunocompromised individuals who live on dairy farms may have
increased risk of infection and VTEC-associated disease. <<
If they are immunocompromised then I guess they are at risk from a whole
host of infections. I would be disappointed if statistics on this group,
who are presumably under intense medical observation, were not available to
the researchers.
As I have commented before these bacteria seem to be endemic in the rural
(and possibly urban) environment. The fact that infection occurs at such a
low rate of 50/M suggests that most people are immune. Trying to remove
such an endemic bacteria would be very difficult, and quite likely
impossible, and would expose susceptible people to the risk of severe
disease were they to become exposed later. Travel to foreign parts, or even
a walk in wild areas containing local herbivores may be sources of
unexpected infection.
Pending the availability of a suitable vaccine a vigorous walk in the
countryside may have immunological benefits as well as physical ones.
