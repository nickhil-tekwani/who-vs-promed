Disease threatens Kenya's food basket
-------------------------------------
The country is yet again staring at a food crisis. There are fears that maize production in some parts of South, Central, and Eastern Kenya could decline by as much as 60 percent. This follows the outbreak of a disease identified as maize lethal necrosis that is transmitted by insects. The disease was first reported in the South Rift before it spread. Its signs were also reported in the North Rift.

Indications are that the disease has now spread to most of the maize growing areas and is reported to have infested the grain basket and its environs. According to the Food Agricultural Organisation of the United Nations [FAO], at least 64 000 hectares [about 158 000 acres] of the crop had been destroyed. It is estimated the country will face a shortfall of over one million bags of maize.

Kenya Agricultural Research Institute (Kari) recommended enforcement of quarantine procedures as a short-term strategy to reduce the impact of the disease. [The] Kenya Farmers Association reckons that the disease is far from over and advised farmers about the importance of crop rotation. But farmers have gone ahead to plant maize in the current season even after being advised against it.

[Maize lethal necrosis (MLN) is caused by co-infection of _Maize chlorotic mottle virus_ (MCMV, genus _Machlomovirus_), transmitted by chrysomelid beetle vectors, and either _Maize dwarf mosaic virus_ (MDMV, genus _Potyvirus_) or _Wheat streak mosaic virus_ (WSMV, genus _Tritimovirus_). MLN has been reported from the Americas and some locations in Europe. The finding in Kenya is the 1st report of MLN as well as MCMV in Africa.

WSMV has not been reported from Africa, but MDMV is known to occur in the region. MDMV is closely related to _Sugarcane mosaic virus_ (SCMV, genus _Potyvirus_), also present in the area, and both are transmitted by a number of aphid species. SCMV has been reported as the co-infecting potyvirus in Kenya, but transmission in maize seed was previously only reported for MDMV, and not SCMV. However, seed transmission of the maize disease in Rift valley has been claimed (see ProMED-mail post 20120614.1167465). Therefore the 2 viruses involved in Kenya may be MCMV and either MDMV (undifferentiated from SCMV in the diagnosis) or a new strain of SCMV that can be seed transmitted in maize. The same disease has also been reported from Tanzania.

Symptoms of the individual viruses are synergistically enhanced in MLN and may include leaf mottling and necrosis, distortion of ears, absence of kernels, as well as stunting, premature aging, and death of plants. Symptoms may disappear during the growing season leaving plants with latent infections but reduced yield as virus reservoirs and making disease monitoring difficult. Infectious vector insects may be carried by wind over long distances. Disease management may include crop rotation, certified clean seeds, control of vector species and weedy reservoir hosts, and use of crop cultivars or hybrids with reduced sensitivity to the viruses. A resistance breeding programme has been set up in Kenya.

A number of, most likely secondary or opportunistic, fungal pathogens in the diseased maize in Kenya have also been reported (ProMED-mail posts 20120117.1012452 and 20120326.1080612), which are further affecting crop health and yield.
