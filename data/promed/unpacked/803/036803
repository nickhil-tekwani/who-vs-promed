Local authorities said Saturday [30 Oct 2010] that 80 people,
including 77 middle school students, are being quarantined amid an
outbreak of paratyphoid fever in south China's Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region. The patients have been quarantined and are being
treated in a local hospital in Luocheng Mulam Autonomous County,
Hechi City, where medical experts are working to contain the disease,
according to a statement from officials of Guangxi's health department.

Paratyphoid fever is caused by drinking or eating contaminated water
or food. Though the disease has some similarities to typhoid fever,
its symptoms are generally less severe.

Cases of paratyphoid type A fever were first reported in late
September 2010 and surged in October. 84 students were reported to
have contracted the disease. Of them, 7 have since been discharged
from the hospital, said Pan Lichang, head of the county's health department.

A high school student, said 17 of her classmates contracted the
disease, suffering from fever, headache, and diarrhea. Most of the
patients are in stable condition, said Wei Dongping, Luocheng's vice
county head.

[Paratyphoid fever is similar to typhoid fever, in that both are
enteric fever types of disease, although the former can be, but is
not necessarily, less severe. The paratyphoid salmonellas are divided
into A, B, and rarely now C. _Salmonella paratyphi_, also referred to
as _S. enterica_ serotype Paratyphi. Types B and C also have species,
now serotypes, _schottmuelleri_ and _hirschfeldii_, respectively.
Like typhoid, paratyphoid is generally considered not to be a
zoonosis, with [only] humans as the reservoir, but the paratyphoid
bacillus has been isolated from domestic animals and fish. - Mod.LL]
