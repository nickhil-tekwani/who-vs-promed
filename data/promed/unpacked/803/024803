N. Korean feathers, pet birds barred from EU due flu
------------------------------------------------
Import of feathers and pet birds from North Korea to the European
Union has been banned following confirmation of an outbreak of deadly
bird flu, the European Commission said on Thursday [14 Apr 2005].
EU animal health experts added North Korea to its list of 8 Asian
nations whose poultry exports to the 25-nation bloc are banned until
the end of Sep 2005 due to uncertainty that avian flu is under
control in the region.
"North Korea is only authorised to export feathers and pet birds to
the EU. Therefore the ban de facto only applies to these products,"
the EU executive said in a statement.
Although the value of imports of North Korean feathers and pet birds
to the EU is very limited, the ban was adopted so there is no chance
contaminated products can enter the EU, a Commission spokesman told a
daily briefing.
The 8 countries whose poultry exports to the EU are banned are
Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Pakistan, Thailand and
Vietnam. [In addition to the above 8 countries, HPAI was recorded in
2004 in Japan and S. Korea. However, both succeeded in eradicating
the disease by stamping out, allowing them to officially declare
freedom of the disease; consequently, the ban upon them has been
removed and they are allowed exporting live poultry and poultry
products to the EU. - Mod.AS]
North Korea and South Korea are due to hold talks next week on ways
of fighting the bird flu outbreak, which has led Pyongyang to cull
more than 210 000 chickens.
A U.N. expert who visited Pyongyang has said the North was battling
the H7 strain, which has yet to be seen in Asia but can cause illness
in humans. The H5N1, the other strain that can infect humans, has
killed 51 people in Asia.
South Korea believes the outbreaks in the North are extensive. Most
of the 25 million birds North Korea produces annually come from huge
farms, one of the growing sectors in a country battling severe food
shortages.
