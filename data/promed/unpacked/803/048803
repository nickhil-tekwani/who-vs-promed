A total of 5 more outbreaks of Newcastle disease have been reported in Israel's Hadarom and Hazafon regions.

Israel has been regularly reporting outbreaks of Newcastle disease for several years. This time, broiler farms were the most affected. The broilers on the Hadarom farm were culled after backyard chickens in a nearby area were found positive for the virus.

In total, over 5000 birds died and another 221 500 were destroyed to prevent the disease from spreading. Vaccination, movement control, zoning and disinfection measures are also being used to control the disease.
