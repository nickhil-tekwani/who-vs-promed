Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: On 22 Dec 2020, the Central Veterinary Laboratory in Algete, Madrid (national reference laboratory for TSEs, accredited under UNE-EN ISO/IEC 17025 standard) received a nerve tissue sample suspected to be infected by bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) from the Regional Laboratory for Animal Health in La Rioja, Finca "La Grajera" (official regional laboratory), after a positive result was obtained through a HerdCheck BSE Antigen Test Kit (Idexx Laboratories) rapid test. The national reference laboratory carried out the confirmation tests authorized according to EU regulation no. 1148/2014. The selected test was the BioRad inmuno-blotting TeSeE Western Blot (Ref: 3551169), with a positive result. Afterward, tests for BSE strain discrimination were carried out through hybrid immunoblotting with antibodies against PrP, confirming atypical BSE (H-type strain). The sample was taken within the national TSE surveillance program (sampling of dead or non-slaughtered for human consumption animals over 48 months old). The animal was a crossbred cow born on 20 Apr 2003.

Control measures
Measures applied: Traceability; official destruction of animal products; official disposal of carcasses, by-products, and waste; selective killing and disposal; disinfection; vaccination permitted (if a vaccine exists); no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: No other measures

Laboratory name and type: Central Veterinary Laboratory, Algete (national laboratory)
Species / Test / Test date / Result
Cattle / Western blot / 23 Dec 2020 / Positive
