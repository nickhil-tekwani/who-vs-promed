It's good to hear that the _Salmonella_ infection rates in slaughter house
isolates for chicken and other meats are being reduced.
A related comment/question regarding _Campylobacter_. Although the
mortality is not as high for _Salmonella_, campylobacteriosis is an
important cause of diarrheal morbidity. Consumer Reports magazine reported
in recent issue on a survey (using chickens purchased at supermarkets) they
had done in May/June 1998 (100 chickens each from each of various chicken
processors). The _Salmonella_ infections were indeed low (11, 4, 8, 14% ,
depending upon brand), and generally lower than a previous survey in March
of last year (4 , 13, 13, 20 %, respectively) but _Campylobacter_ infection
rates were much higher (60 - 80 %) than _Salmonella_ rates in this recent
survey, and if anything, slightly higher than in the survey conducted last
year (range 54 - 77 %).
If the HACCP inspection focus has had an impact on _Salmonella_ rates, why
haven't the _Campylobacter_ rates been decreased as well? I had presumed
some of the changes the companies were implementing were designed to
improve cleanliness, reduce the amount of comtamination, and so on. Does
anyone have any idea why _Salmonella_ contamination rates would be
affected, but _Campylobacter_ contamination rates would not? Does anyone
know what the specific changes in procedures are that the chicken companies
are using to reduce the _Salmonella_ contamination rates? (Do they includ
antibiotics in feed that are specific against _Salmonella_ species, but not
against _Campylobacter_?)
Are there other explanations? Does anyone know the recent slaughterhouse
rates for _Campylobacter_? Is it possible that in the journey from
slaughter house to market that _Campylobacter_ multiplies better than
_Salmonella_ so that at the market, _Salmonella_ contaminations appear low,
but _Campylobacter_ appear high (far-fetched, I think, but until we know
the _Campylobacter_ contamination rates at the slaughterhouse, it is a
remote possibility).
