_E. coli_ alert prompts beef recall
-----------------------------------
Calgary-based Westfair Foods Ltd. is voluntarily recalling certain ground
beef products, including ground sirloin that consumers may have purchased
in Jun 2005 at 4 British Columbia grocery outlets. The beef, supplied by XL
Grinding, may be contaminated with _E. coli_ O157:H7 bacteria.
The Canadian Food Inspection Agency and Westfair Foods warned Friday that
Westfair Foods ground beef sold during a small window in early to mid-June
2005 at the 4 stores should not be consumed. So far, there have been 2
reported illnesses associated with the product.
Lori Stene, spokeswoman for Westfair Foods, said it is not known how much
beef product was affected. "Because we enlarged the recall and the warning
to include absolutely everything, it's really hard to say how much ground
beef we're talking about."
Westfair Foods ground beef products from the following locations are
affected by the warning:
Real Canadian Superstore at 291 Cowichan Way, RR No 6, Duncan, bearing a
best-before date of JN15 to JN19, purchased between 12-17 Jun 2005;
Real Canadian Superstore at 1105 Eaton Centre, Metrotown, Burnaby, bearing
a best-before date of JN08 to JN11, purchased between 5-8 Jun 2005;
Real Canadian Wholesale Club at 5335 Kingsway, Burnaby, bearing a
best-before date of JN08 to JN12, purchased between 6-9 Jun 2005; and
Extra Foods at 7190 Kerr St., Vancouver, bearing a best-before date of JN08
to JN12, purchased between 6-9 Jun 2005.
