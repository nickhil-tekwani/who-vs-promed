A rabid bat was brought to Busch Gardens [in Tampa, Florida] by 2 people in mid-March 2015 and now the Hillsborough County Health Department is searching for them.

The couple carried the bat to a park staff member in a small cardboard box and explained they had not been bitten by it. Because of this, the Department of Health thinks the couple's risk of infection is minimal since rabies is transmitted by open wounds or through mucous membranes like the mouth or eyes.

But Health Department official's wants [to] nail down the couple's level of exposure and find out precisely where the bat was discovered, since one rabid bat might mean there are more in the area.

The employee who received the bat was up-to-date on rabies vaccines and there is no concern for his health.

The couple was driving a Ford F150 pick-up truck.

If you have information about where this couple is, please contact the Hillsborough County Health Department at 813-307-8059.

[It is likely the risk to the couple is low. However, the question of where they got the bat and did they pick it up without gloves to put in the box, make it understandable that authorities are trying to find them for more history on the situation. - Mod.TG
