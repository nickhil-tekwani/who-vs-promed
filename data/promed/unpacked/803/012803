I am Dr. Esther Tan writing on behalf of the Quarantine & Epidemiology Dept.,
Ministry of Environment, Singapore.
This is in response to your request for more information regarding the
imported
case of cholera in Singapore notified to us on 17 Jul 2000.
This was a case of _Vibrio cholerae_ 01, biotype El Tor, serotype Ogawa
confirmed
in a 39 year old Malay male. He had travelled to Tanjong Pinang, Indonesia
from 7 to 9 Jul 2000, and developed symptoms on 9 Jul 2000. The patient has
since recovered from the illness and is well.
