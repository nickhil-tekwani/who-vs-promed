The number of mumps cases increased even during the summer break, which is why there is a potential for a rapid increase in cases now that the students have returned to campus. The suggestion of maintaining a 6-foot distance would be difficult in any classroom or cafeteria.

Local health officials are continuing to try to get a growing University of Illinois mumps outbreak under control by offering 2 more free, all-day vaccination clinics for students this week. Students are also being urged to keep their distance from each other.

"Try to maintain a 6-foot distance from other individuals, which admittedly isn't possible in many classroom environments," says a mass communication just sent to students and their families, advising them about protecting themselves and the rest of the community from the mumps outbreak that began in April 2015 and escalated over the summer.

Health officials have linked most cases of mumps, a highly contagious viral illness, to the UI campus. There were 101 confirmed cases as of Wednesday [16 Sep 2015?], according to Champaign-Urbana Public Health District Administrator, Julie Pryde. Most mumps cases have been mild, since they've involved people who have been vaccinated with the measles/mumps/rubella vaccine. But there remains a potential for a serious case among those who aren't able to safely receive the vaccine, Pryde said.

The health district and the UI McKinley Health Center have been steadily giving an extra, 3rd dose of the vaccine to students, faculty and staff since early August 2015 in hope of getting the outbreak under control before most students returned for the fall [2015] semester, and other students were asked to get an extra vaccine dose before they returned to campus. But officials have yet to see the outbreak tail off.

With the rest of the students back on campus now, she said, "it has the potential to explode. That's what we're trying to avoid. All of a sudden, the kids are back." Those who haven't had an extra MMR shot have 2 extra chances to get one at vaccination clinics being held from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Wednesday and Thursday [23-24 Sep 2015] at the Illinois Union.

Pryde said the public health district has also blanketed medical providers throughout Illinois with information about mumps and urged them to test anyone with mumps symptoms, since this isn't an illness often seen these days. One thing that has horrified her, she said, is that there have been adults walking around in this outbreak with clear cases of mumps that were misdiagnosed. "We've talked about it incessantly," she said.

Dr. Robert Palinkas, director of the UI McKinley Health Center, said all mumps outbreaks that have occurred at universities over the past decade have involved vaccinated students. That's because the blended MMR vaccine involves a strong component for measles, but the vaccine for mumps is only 89 percent effective.

Palinkas told students and faculty at a Senate Executive Committee meeting on Monday [21 Sep 2015] that since there's no treatment for mumps, the only options are to provide booster shots, isolate those who get sick, and try to do something difficult to do on campus, inhibit social interaction.

"I had to go to a kid's apartment today [22 Sep 2015] and drag him to McKinley under threat of whatever and make him call his mom to come get him, because he didn't want to leave town because it was the 1st week of school, and he had mumps," he said. "So it's a struggle."

Health officials always notify roommates and housing units when a student gets mumps, but "at this point, it's going to be a more careful and thoughtful process of excluding more and more people," who may have been exposed, given that several thousand students might not be immune to the disease, he said. Students "are not going to be happy with some of the sanctions," he said. "It will be a challenge."

[Mumps is an acute viral disease that is spread from person to person by coughing or sneezing. Some people may have no symptoms or very mild symptoms, but they can still pass the virus on to others.

The symptoms of mumps include a low-grade fever and swelling or tenderness of one or more of the salivary glands in the cheeks and under the jaw. In males who have gone through puberty, up to 30 percent may experience testicular pain and swelling.

Symptoms usually appear between 12 and 25 days after a person has been exposed to the mumps virus. As many as 30 to 40 percent of infected people will not have symptoms, and nearly 50 percent will have non-specific or mostly respiratory symptoms, with or without infection in the salivary glands.

There is a vaccine to protect against mumps. The vaccine is given as part of a combination vaccine called the MMR vaccine, which protects against measles, mumps, and rubella.

Vaccination of adults: To prevent mumps. adults born in 1957 or later including non-pregnant women of childbearing age who do not have a medical contraindication should receive at least one dose of the MMR vaccine, unless they can document that they have received at least one dose of mumps-containing vaccine or have other acceptable evidence of immunity to the disease.

College and university students, healthcare personnel, and international travelers are at increased risk for mumps and should receive 2 doses of the MMR vaccine or have other acceptable evidence of immunity to ensure adequate protection.

The MMR vaccine is very safe and highly effective with few side effects. Mild reactions such as fever, redness, or swelling at the injection site have been reported. Adult women may infrequently have joint symptoms like pain and stiffness from the rubella part of the vaccine.

The potential risks associated with measles, mumps, and rubella are much greater than the potential risks associated with the vaccine. MMR vaccine should not be given to persons who are pregnant or severely immuno-suppressed.
