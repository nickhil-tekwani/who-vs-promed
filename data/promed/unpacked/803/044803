H7N9 situation update
---------------------
Overview
--------
Situation: Influenza A(H7N9) virus with pandemic potential.

Country: China; 3 human cases originated in China and were reported in Malaysia (1) and Canada (2).

Number of human cases: 751 confirmed; 294 deaths (since February 2013)

Provinces/municipalities: Beijing and Shanghai; Anhui; Fujian; Guangdong; Hebei; Henan; Hunan; Jiangsu; Jiangxi; Shandong; Zhejiang; Guangxi; Guizhou; Jilin; Qinghai; Hubei; Taiwan Province of China; Hong Kong SAR; Macao SAR, Ningxia Hui and Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Regions; Sabah (Malaysia); British Columbia (Canada).

Animal/environmental findings: over 2000 virological samples from the environment, chickens, pigeons, ducks and a tree sparrow tested positive; positives mainly from live bird markets, vendors and some commercial or breeding farms.

FAO actions: liaise with China and partners, monitor situation, monitor virus evolution, conduct market chain analysis, risk assessment, surveillance guidance and communication.

Animals
-------
9 Mar 2016: MoA [Ministry of Agriculture] published the results of the national animal H7N9 surveillance for the month of February [2016]: a total of 26 555 virological and 50 129 serum samples were collected from 3412 locations in 20 provinces. Two virological samples from chickens tested positive for H7N9 in Zhejiang (from a slaughtering facility in Ningbo City) and Guangdong (from a market in Chaozhou City) provinces. Five (5) chicken serum samples tested positive for H7 antibodies in Hebei Province (originating from 4 chicken farms/households in Zhumadian City.

Humans
------
Since the last update (1 Mar 2016), 6 new human cases have been reported in Anhui (4), Guangdong (1) and Hubei (1) provinces. The official reports for the month of February [2016] showed that there were 9 additional human cases, including cases in Jiangsu (6) and Fujian (3), and tables have been updated accordingly.

For detailed information on human cases, please refer to WHO's Disease Outbreak News.

Publications
------------
In addition to the surveillance findings by MoA and MoH, 1728 virologically positive samples have also been reported in 12 peer-reviewed articles. A total of 71 920 samples have been collected in these studies since April 2013, of which 1728 (2.4 percent) were positive for H7N9 (1215 environmental samples, 501 chickens, 1 goose and 1 tree sparrow).

FAO's support to countries
--------------------------
- FAO continues supporting at-risk countries with surveillance and preparedness for H7N9 incursion
- FAO is providing surveillance and sampling guidance for South and Southeast Asia
- Funding to date: USD 8.1 million mobilized (USD 6.2 million USAID, USD 1.9 million TCPs)

H7N9 background
---------------
On 31 Mar 2013, the authorities of the People's Republic of China reported the 1st human cases of infection with the novel avian influenza A(H7N9) to the World Health Organization in line with the International Health Regulations of 2007.

The disease situation in humans continues to evolve, with new cases reported regularly by the Chinese authorities. Cases have been confined to China with the exception of tourists testing positive in other countries but nevertheless linked to China as the place of exposure.

Human H7N9 infections follow a seasonal pattern, peaking in the winter months with most cases observed between October and March and sporadic cases during the summer.

Human infection
---------------
The strain of influenza A(H7N9) virus that emerged in 2013 is able to infect humans and cause severe disease. There had been no previous reports of infection of humans with viruses of the H7N9 subtype prior to this time. Information on human infection with influenza A(H7N9) is available from WHO.

Reports suggest most human cases had direct or indirect contact with poultry prior to the onset of disease. Case control studies suggest contact with poultry or a visit to a live poultry market in the 2 weeks prior to disease inset was a significant risk factor. In a number of cases where testing of poultry or environmental samples from markets associated with human cases was performed, H7N9 virus has been detected.

More specifically, cases have been reported in humans who:
- visited live bird market;
- slaughtered poultry or pigeons;
- transported poultry;
- brought live poultry into their home.

WHO reports that there is no evidence suggesting sustained human-to-human transmission.

Influenza A(H7N9) virus appears to infect humans more easily than H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza based on its genetic properties for adaptation to mammalian cells.

Around 38 percent of reported human infections have had a fatal outcome. Reports to the World Health Organization (WHO) suggest that 80 percent of human cases have had direct or indirect contact with live poultry prior to the onset of disease, including LBM visits, transportation, slaughtering and handling of poultry.

This is the 1st time that a low pathogenic (LPAI) influenza A virus of the H7N9 subtype has been identified in humans, and only subsequently in domestic poultry (chickens, domestic pigeons and a few ducks) through follow-up virological surveillance in live bird markets (LBMs) linked to human cases. Extensive poultry surveillance in neighbouring countries or those with poultry trade links to China has not detected the virus so far.

Origin of H7N9
--------------
Influenza A(H7N9) evolved through several reassortment events putatively from early 2012 onwards.

The 4 parental viruses have been previously detected in wild birds (H7 virus and N9 viruses) and chickens (2 different H9N2 viruses) in Asia.

The H7N9 virus was 1st detected in March 2013 in 2 human cases in China. Since then, the virus continues to antigenetically evolve and to undergo reassortment with locally circulating H9N2 viruses.

1. H7N9: FluTrackers (https://flutrackers.com/forum/forum/china-h7n9-outbreak-tracking/143874-flutrackers-2013-16-human-case-list-of-provincial-ministry-of-health-government-confirmed-influenza-a-h7n9-cases-with-links) lists a total of 767 cases of H7N9, including the last case reported in [3] below, which is outside the window of this report. Nonetheless, the FluTrackers number is slightly discrepant with the report above.

2. H5N6: On 15 Mar 2016, a critical case of H5N6 in Guangdong was reported by ProMED-mail (Avian influenza, human (30): Egypt (Cairo) H5N1, China (GD) H5N6 20160315.4095095). From 2014 to date, a total of 10 human cases of avian influenza A(H5N6) have been reported by the Mainland health authorities. This case occurred just outside the window of this report.

3. H5N1: 3 cases of H5N1 have been reported in China. On 7 Mar 2016, the 1st case of H5N1 was reported from Sichuan (ProMED-mail post Avian influenza, human (11): China (SC) H5N1 20160114.3936791) and 1 in Cairo, 1 in Giza on 10 and 12 Mar 2016, respectively (ProMED-mail post Avian influenza, human (30): Egypt (Cairo) H5N1, China (GD) H5N6 20160315.4095095). - Mod.LK]

China (Sichuan) woman contracts H9N2 avian influenza
----------------------------------------------------
The case was a 57-year-old female from Sichuan Province. Date of illness onset is unknown as the patient was hospitalized on 9 Feb 2016 with a history of recurrent productive cough with fatigue and shortness of breath during the past year. The patient has chronic underlying conditions. On 16 Feb 2016, a sample from this patient tested positive for A(H9N2) virus. The patient remains hospitalized and epidemiological investigations including contact monitoring are ongoing.

A total of 28 laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H9N2) viruses, none fatal, have been detected globally. In most human cases, the associated disease symptoms have been mild and there has been no evidence of human-to-human transmission. Influenza A(H9N2) viruses are enzootic in poultry populations in parts of Africa, Asia and the Middle East.

Most human cases are exposed to the A(H9N2) virus through contact with infected poultry or contaminated environments. Human infection tends to result in mild clinical illness. Since the virus continues to be detected in poultry populations, further human cases can be expected.

[H9N2 is the most common subtype of influenza virus in chickens in China. It also causes a great economic loss for the poultry industry, even under the long-term vaccination programs. Recent human infections with avian inﬂuenza virus revealed that H9N2 is the gene donor for H7N9 and H10N8 viruses that are infecting humans too. The crucial role of H9N2 viruses at the animal-human interface is due to the wide host range, adaptation to both poultry and mammals and extensive gene reassortment. In China, which is regarded as an epicenter of avian influenza viruses, the H9N2 virus has been detected in multiple avian species, including chicken, duck, quail, pheasant, partridge, pigeon, silky chicken, chukar and egret.

Epidemiological and genetic studies revealed that the hemagglutinin (HA) gene of the H9N2 influenza viruses could be divided into Eurasian avian and American avian lineages. The virus can be transmitted by air droplet, dust, feed, or water between birds and from chickens to humans.

[The zoonotic H7N9 virus strain, causing human infections in China, circulates mostly in live poultry markets. This virus if of low pathogenicity in poultry (LPAI H7N9): the disease symptoms in birds are slight or absent, the birds being the reservoir of the virus without becoming sick, their being infected discovered only by tests applied to apparently healthy animals. China's Ministry of Agriculture publishes monthly reports of the serological and virological systematic surveillance activities and their respective results. During Feb 2016 (most recent available report), sampling was applied in 3412 households in 19 of China's provinces. The total number of samples tested serologically for H7 was 50 129. The only province where seropositive samples were found was Henan, where 5 out of 2356 samples (0.21 percent) were found seropositive. The pathogen H7N9 was detected in 2 samples from Chickens, namely in the provinces Guangdong (one sample out of 14 976, open market), and in Zhejiang (one sample out of 301). See, in Chinese, at http://www.moa.gov.cn/sjzz/syj/dwyqdt/jczt/201603/t20160309_5044641.htm.

China's final report (No 18) to the OIE on H7N9 was submitted on 31 Aug 2015, when the outbreak was declare "resolved", with no additional reports to be submitted.

OIE's Q&A on LPAI H7N9 is available at http://www.oie.int/en/for-the-media/press-releases/detail/article/questions-and-answers-on-influenza-ah7n9/.- Mod.AS]
