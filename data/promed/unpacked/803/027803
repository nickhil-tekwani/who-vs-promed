The Secretary of Health is setting up a technical
team with specialists from different Brazilian
states in order to pinpoint the focus of
infection of the "barbeiros" (Triatomid kissing
bugs), hosts of the _Trypanosoma cruzi_ parasite,
that might be implicated in the present epidemic
of Chagas disease. This decision was taken after
the confirmation last Saturday that the 3 deaths
(now 4) in the same family from Itai were due to
this disease. As of today, 20 cases of Chagas
have been confirmed in this state, with 14 people
admitted to hospitals. 8 cases are being
investigated. Another 3 deaths during the month
of March 2005 are also now under suspicion and
are being looked into again.

The investigators will be working on 2 fronts.
One of them will be to look for barbeiros that
might be infected with _Trypanosoma cruzi_. "In
Santa Catarina the presence of barbeiros is
common, but they are not known to be infected
with the parasites", said the director of Nereu
Ramos Hospital, the infectious disease specialist
Antonio Miranda.

The main suspicion is that the insects infected
with the parasite could have arrived here in
cargo trucks. The 2nd team in the investigation
will examine samples of sugar cane for possible
contamination and, if found positive, try to find
the focus of transmission, e.g. the places that
sold the contaminated sugarcane juice.

The work of the public health team will begin in
the Northern Littoral area, where most of the
cases have been diagnosed. But the State
Secretary of Health, Dado Cherem, said that other
regions in Santa Catarina State will be
investigated as well.

The present situation in Santa Catarina is
considered unusual, because for many years no
indigenous cases of Chagas infection were
detected in the state. All the patients diagnosed
and/or being treated for Chagas disease here had
contracted the infection elsewhere. The 2nd
unusual factor is the form of transmission --
ingestion of sugarcane juice -- which is still
under investigation. Typically transmission of
Chagas occurs through the bite of a barbeiro
infected with _Trypanosoma cruzi_ (in fact,
through the feces of the insect). "Our suspicion
is that the infected barbeiros had been hiding
inside the cane; when the cane was crushed, the
juice became contaminated. Another possibility is
that the cane was contaminated with the feces of
the insects, without them necessarily being
present inside the cane at the time of production
of the juice," adds Miranda.

The Ministry of Health has released a national
alert and ordered each state's Epidemiological
Surveillance Section to be alert for the presence
of symptoms of (acute) Chagas disease. This
measure has been taken due to the fact that in
the past few months (and presently) many tourists
visiting Santa Catarina might have been at risk
of contracting the disease. The State Secretary
of Health has also begun a media campaign
alerting the public to the Chagas epidemic and
advising all people that present symptoms
compatible with the disease to receive medical
and laboratory examinations.

The Secretary of Health's recommendation is that
all persons that suffer from high fever of more
than 5 days duration, headaches, body or joint
aches, and swellings should go to a local
hospital for tests. The advice applies to those
people that have drunk sugarcane juice since 1
Feb 2005 in the following municipalities:
Navegantes, Itajai, Penha, Picarras, Barra Velha,
Araquari, Joinville, Balneario Barra do Sul,
Garuva, Itapema, Camboriu, Balneario Camboriu,
Sao Francisco do Sul, and Itapoa.

More than 20 days elapsed from the time the 1st
cases presented to the health providers until the
identification of the outbreak as Chagas. During
that time, several laboratory tests were
performed to identify the cause. "Diseases like
Chagas, leptospirosis and hantavirosis can give
cross-reactions [?]; that's why sometimes we got
positive results for leptospirosis and other
times for hantavirus", explains the state's
Director of Epidemiological Surveillance, Luis
Antonio Silva.

Once some tests for Chagas gave positive results,
all the other cases were re-checked and also
turned up to be positive and were confirmed. As
per the infectious disease specialist Luiz
Enrique Melo, the fact that the route of
infection was ingestion accelerated the
appearance of the symptoms of Chagas. He says
that when the infection happens through the
"bite" of the barbeiro, only a small number of
parasites enter the body, which has then time to
mount a immunological response. "In the cases
that have been confirmed in Santa Catarina, there
seem to have been a very large quantity of
parasites being ingested, which resulted in a
severe acute syndrome of the disease, to which
the body did not have time to respond and fight."

(Other press articles state that, in addition to
the ban on sugarcane juice and other products,
the state government in Santa Catarina has
impounded hundreds of kilos of sugarcane. Today,
23 Mar 2005, the Brazilian press announced that
authorities are presently investigating whether
the sugarcane could have been contaminated with
urine and/or feces of "gambas", small field
rodents, which apparently can be carriers of the
disease. There seems to have been a precedent: a
more limited Chagas epidemic in Paraiba, North
East Brazil, in1986. As of today there have been
4 deaths due to this outbreak, 19 cases
laboratory-confirmed, and 37 suspected.)

Chagas alert extended to 3 countries.
--------------------------------
The alert on the risk of contamination of Chagas
disease through sugar cane broth was extended to
Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay, neighboring
countries to the state of Santa Catarina, where 3
persons have died after having ingested a drink
probably infected with the feces of the
"barbeiro" (reduvida bug), the insect vector of
the disease. A force-task comprised of
technicians from the State Secretariat of Health
and the Ministry of Health began looking for foci
of the barbeiro in the Itajai region today.
There have already been 19 confirmed cases of the
disease [Chagas]. There is also a suspected
death [due to Chagas disease] in a Bolivian
tourist.

[Since the decline of vector-transmitted disease
in Brazil, 1st in the State of Sao Paulo in the
1970s and then in other states in the 1990s, oral
transmission has been a subject of growing
concern. No doubt oral transmission to humans has
been occurring for a long time. However, in the
context of high levels of vector transmission,
these cases went unnoticed. In the 1990s human
cases acquired by the oral route were reported.

Shikanai-Yasuda et al. reported 3 cases by oral
transmission, apart from one possibly by
breast-feeding (Shikanai-Yasuda MA et al.Acute
Chagas' disease: transmission routes, clinical
aspects and response to specific therapy in
diagnosed cases in an urban center. Rev Inst Med
Trop Sao Paulo. 1990;32(1):16-27. Article in
Portuguese, English abstract available in
PubMed). A year later, the same group reported an
outbreak in 1986, with 26 patients that acquired
Chagas� disease with acute phase symptoms after a
family gathering in the Northeastern state of
Paraiba (Shikanai-Yasuda MA et al. Possible oral
transmission of acute Chagas' disease in
Brazil.Rev Inst Med Trop Sao Paulo.
1991;33(5):351-7. This report has become a
classic, and the situation resembles the one now
seen in Santa Catarina.

The Southern state of Santa Catarina has never
been an endemic area for Chagas�disease. Although
the triatomid bugs in question (_Panstrongylus
megistus_) can be found in forest areas, they
have not moved into homes, as in Bahia or Minas
Gerais, states well North of Santa Catarina.

Chagas� disease in wildlife is common in Santa
Catarina, as well as in coastal areas in South
and Southeastern Brazil. A rather recent paper
(Carvalho ME et al. Chagas' disease in the
southern coastal region of Brazil. Rev Saude
Publica. 2003;37(1):49-58. (article in
Portuguese, English abstract available in PubMed)
reported that oral sporadic transmission seems to
be rather common in certain rural areas. This has
been reported also from the Amazon, associated
with acai, a rain-forest fruit that is rather a
fad in urban areas, causing a small boom in the
acai industry. This fruit is processed much in
the same way as sugar-cane, in order to obtain a
paste. As the fruit is found in palm-like trees,
a favorite habitat of triatomid bugs, the result
is a fruit paste contaminated with _Trypanosoma
cruzi_.

The most probable explanation for the outbreak in
Santa Catarina is that sugar-cane was harvested
and kept in some kind of makeshift shed that
harbored triatomid bugs, and the droppings of
these bugs contaminated the sugarcane, resulting
in a juice with _T. cruzi_. As sugarcane juice
(locally called "garapa") is drunk fresh,
immediately after processing, the risk of
infection is high. - Mod.LJS]

[Oral transmission of _T.cruzi_ to mammals was
first demonstrated experimentally in 1958
(Phillips NR, Thesis, University of London, cited
by Hoare CA in "The Trypanosomes of mammals,
Blackwell Scientific Publ., London 1972), when 50
percent of mice became infected after being fed
_T.cruzi_-infected triatomid bugs. Ingestion of
infected vectors was also found to be the main
mode of transmission among wood-rats in north
America (Ryckman & Olsen, J Med Entomol
1972,2:99).

Triatomid bugs have a preference for feeding from
the face of sleeping humans and shed the
parasites in their feces after the blood meal.
The parasites are then thought to infect humans
through the mucus membranes in the mouth or the
conjunctiva. There is no information on how long
the epimastigotes of _T.cruzi_ remain infective
after being passed in bug feces, which seems to
be a key parameter for food-borne transmission. -
