The outbreak of koi herpesvirus (KHV) disease was confirmed at Brockamin Fisheries, Leigh, Hereford and Worcestershire [England].

The site is now subject to statutory controls to prevent or limit the spread of the disease. The Fish Health Inspectorate (FHI) at Cefas, acting on behalf of Defra, has issued a confirmed designation prohibiting the movement of fish to, from and within the fishery complex.

Fishery equipment disinfection and movement control measures are in place and anglers must ensure that they comply with all biosecurity measures within the designated area.

The fishery owner/manager reported the problem for further investigation and had voluntarily closed the affected water in advance of official controls.

KHV has no implications for human health. It is, nonetheless, a serious viral disease of fish, and is notifiable in the United Kingdom. KHV affects all varieties of common and ornamental carp (_Cyprinus carpio_) and can result in high rates of fish mortalities.

Clinical signs of KHV disease may include white or necrotic patches on the gills, rough patches on the skin, sloughing mucous and sunken eyes. These signs usually appear when water temperatures are between 16 and 28 degrees centigrade.

Anyone noting deaths in carp or carp hybrids, with signs of disease similar to those above, or have suspicion of notifiable disease in any aquatic animal, should immediately contact the FHI.

Anyone who imports, keeps, fishes for, or retails carp (common and ornamental) and carp hybrids should take precautions to prevent the spread of KHV.

[Koi herpesvirus disease (KHD) has been reported throughout the world. The disease is transmitted by fish to fish contact and it is also possible that the disease can spread through contaminated water, nets and other equipment. As other herpesvirus, KHD has the capacity to remain latent in the infected fish and become activated and cause disease when some stressors trigger it. [More information on KHD is found in OIE Manual of Diagnostic Tests for Aquatic Animals 2009 Chapter 2.3.6., which is available at http://web.oie.int/eng/normes/fmanual/2.3.06_KHVD.pdf.] - Mod.PMB
