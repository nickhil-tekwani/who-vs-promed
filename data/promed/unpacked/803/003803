Thousands of Caspian seals (_Phoca caspica_) have died in the Caspian Sea
since Apr 2000. An international team of scientists, working as part of the
Caspian Environment Program's Ecotoxicology Project (ECOTOX), has now
concluded canine distemper virus (CDV) infection was the primary cause of
this die-off. The results of this investigation have been accepted for
publication in a forthcoming issue of Emerging Infectious Diseases.
Scientists from a number of institutions and visited areas of seal
mortality in Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan during May and Jun 2000 to conduct
post-mortem examinations and collect tissue and blood samples from dead
seals. They worked in collaboration with several laboratories.
Blood and tissue samples, collected from 16 dead seals found on the Caspian
coasts of Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan, were analyzed in a
variety of animal health and viral laboratories in several countries.
Microscopic lesions, characteristic of canine distemper, were found in over
50% of seals from which suitable tissues were available. These lesions were
frequently associated with large amounts of morbillivirus antigen as
demonstrated by immunohistochemical labelling. Canine distemper virus
(CDV)infection was identified by the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain
reaction technique in tissues from 9 of 12 seals tested, and also by
nucleotide sequencing of selected P gene fragments. IgG and/or IgM
antibodies to CDV were found in 12 of 13 sera tested. These findings in
seals from several geographically dispersed regions of the Caspian Sea
indicate recent infection with CDV and provide strong evidence this virus
was the primary cause of the epizootic.
Canine distemper virus is a morbillivirus which, in 1987-1988, caused high
mortality in Baikal seals (_Phoca siberica_) in Lake Baikal in Siberia and
is suspected of having caused a die-off of crabeater seals in Antarctica in
1955. It was previously identified in a single Caspian seal in 1997 but
could not be linked to disease in Caspian seals then. Other morbilliviruses
(phocine and cetacean morbilliviruses) have caused several major epizootics
among aquatic mammal populations in various regions of the world in recent
years.
Further studies are underway to determine the potential role of pollution
in the recent epizootic, which was recently continuing in some areas of the
Caspian Sea.
Details of the results will be available very soon from the Emerging
Infectious Diseases website .
