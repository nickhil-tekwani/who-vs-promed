When collecting toxicologic samples for any unknown toxicologic event, I
recommend that you collect at least 6 cc of liver, lungs and kidney. If
bile and urine are available collect as much of these as possible. Be sure
each sample is kept as clean as possible and placed in individual
containers. I recommend small urine cups. If you have teflon coated
aluminum foil this is one of the best materials to store samples in,
regular aluminum foil will work too. As for the urine and bile samples
place these in urine cups. Be sure to freeze these samples as soon as
possible and try to get these samples to an ultra-low freezer to keep them
cold for shipment to your toxicology laboratory. You can send this to the
laboratory on dry ice.
Remember that toxic events are a rarity and most deaths are due to
infectious or traumatic causes. If you decide to take samples, be sure to
take proper bacterial cultures and liver, lung and kidney for viral
cultures. Do not place these samples on dry ice since the CO2 will make
carbonic acid and possibly sterilize your samples. I recommend shipping
these on wet ice or the freezer packs that many biological samples are sent
on.
Finally, remember to take samples for pathology. A complete set of tissues
is important. Important tissues to take are lung, liver, kidney,
adrenals, heart, spleen, pancreas, various levels of intestine,
mediastinal and mesenteric lymph nodes, urinary bladder and brain (if out
in the field, use the ax method to remove the brain it is very easy to do)
as well as any other tissue that you might think appropriate (e.g. eyes,
reproductive, skin, oral cavity). Be sure to place this in 10 % neutral
buffered formalin at a 10 to 1 ratio.

[Thanks very much for this detailed and practical guide in case any more
manatees show up in French Guiana for Dr. Vie to investigate. Should this
happen, I hope he has good luck with the ax method. Thanks very much to
David Hause, also of AFIP, who provided similar information. - Mod.PC
