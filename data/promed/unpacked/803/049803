DENGUE - BELIZE: REQUEST FOR INFO

I have just heard on our 9:00 PM radio newscast that Dengue is now
officially endemic in Belize City. It struck us here in Northern Belize
five weeks ago. During this period most local news was saying that it was
not Dengue but Flu. It takes six weeks for the results of a serological
test here. Though the differential diagnosis is quite specific (high
fever, pain in joints, etc.), modern medicine requires serological
evidence. During this time the local medical fraternity pumps huge amounts
of antibiotics.
I have noticed that it would appear that this triggered very adverse
reactions in duration and intensity of infection. Is this possible?
[Dengue and flu often occur together in outbreaks, because they both peak
in the rainy season, and are quite difficult to distinguish clinically.
Dengue testing is available free from the CDC Dengue Branch in Puerto Rico
and the CDC Vector-borne Diseases Division in Fort Collins, Colorado --
perhaps also from CAREC, Trinidad?
I don't know anything about antibiotic treatment making dengue symptoms
worse; I would have thought it would have no effect either way - Mod.JW]
