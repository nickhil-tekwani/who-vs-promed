Pima County is seeing an increase in hepatitis A cases, climbing to 20 so far for 2019, surpassing annual totals for 4 of the last 5years.

The Pima County Health Department is urging all people at risk, especially those experiencing homelessness and those who are using (or trying to quit using) illegal drugs, to get vaccinated against hepatitis A.

According to the county health department, since 1 Nov 2018, when investigators believe the outbreak began, there have been 34 cases linked to the outbreak, with 27 of those cases resulting in hospitalization. "As we continue to see cases, we are diligently working to protect the people most vulnerable from becoming infected," said deputy county health director Paula Mandel in a recent news release. "We are seeing this outbreak hit users of illicit drugs, those trying to quit illicit drugs, and people experiencing homelessness. We want to get the word out that the safe and effective vaccine and good hand hygiene can help protect you."

"We are taking action to get ahead of this, to stop this infectious disease from continuing to spread," said Dr. Carlos Perez-Velez, Health Department deputy chief medical officer, in the same release. "With the continued support and cooperation of partners throughout the community, we have been able to provide more and more hepatitis A virus vaccinations to the vulnerable residents at high risk."

Although the hepatitis A vaccine is routinely given to children as part of the recommended vaccination schedule, most adults have not been vaccinated.

In mid-December [2018], the Louisiana Department of Health declared an outbreak of hepatitis A virus (HAV). At that time, a couple dozen outbreak cases were reported. Since then, the number of outbreak hepatitis A cases have about doubled. As of [Fri 18 Jan 2019], Louisiana has 47 reported cases of outbreak HAV infection.

Eight out of 10 patients required hospitalization. Of the 13 parishes affected by the outbreak, Morehouse Parish continues to report the most cases.

This increase in cases mirrors the hepatitis A outbreaks occurring in other states, which are affecting certain risk groups:
- People reporting drug use (injection and non-injection),
- People experiencing homelessness,
- Men who have sex with men,
- Incarcerated or recently incarcerated individuals, and
- People who have been in close contact of someone infected with hepatitis A.

While HAV infections usually resolve without treatment, illnesses and deaths in the current national outbreaks have been higher than usual due to older age and underlying health conditions, especially chronic liver disease, of people affected.

A single dose of hepatitis A vaccine in previously unvaccinated persons is 95% seroprotective and has been demonstrated to help curb outbreaks.

[As the numbers of cases continue to rise in a number of states, and news of smaller (so far) outbreaks occur in others, the question asked at the end of a recent ProMED-mail post by a Kentucky official -- "This is a disease of developing countries. One has to ask: Why are we seeing it in the USA?" -- is more and more relevant. We are seeing these outbreaks because of the inability of local governments to deal with marginalized populations among their midst. The dramatic cutbacks in public health infrastructure in some of these states clearly feed the fire of these outbreaks. It must be addressed by bolstering public health resources and education and directly addressing the needs of these marginalized populations. - Mod.LL
