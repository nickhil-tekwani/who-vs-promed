[Though the above 2 outbreaks seem to be subclinical infections of a
low pathogenic avian influenza virus, according to OIE's
International Animal Health Code requirements they are notifiable,
namely regarded as "low pathogenicity notifiable avian influenza
(LPNAI)." LPNAI are all influenza A viruses of H5 and H7 subtype that
are not HPNAI (highly pathogenic notifiable avian influenza).

It will be interesting to obtain more epidemiological details on
outbreak 2, including the species of the affected poultry. - Mod.AS]
