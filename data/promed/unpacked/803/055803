Hantavirus in England: detection of a UK strain of Seoul virus in wild brown rats (_Rattus norvegicus_)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hantaviruses (genus _Hantavirus_, family _Bunyaviridae_) are a group of rodent-borne viruses with a wide global distribution. There are more than 40 recognised species of hantavirus and each species appears to be specific to a different host, and therefore limited to the host distribution [1]. At least 21 hantaviruses are confirmed to be human pathogens, 4 of which are known to occur in Europe (table 1) [2].

Human infection most often occurs when breathing in dried aerosolised excreta from infected rodents however the direct introduction into broken skin or conjunctiva is also a possible route of transmission. Disease in humans was 1st recognised in Korea in the early 1950's, although the virus was not identified until 1976 [3]. 2 clinical syndromes are associated with severe disease [2]: haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in Europe and Asia caused predominantly by infection with Hantaan virus (HTNV), Dobrava virus (DOBV), Saaremaa virus (SAAV), Seoul virus (SEOV) and Puumala virus (PUUV); and, hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS) in the Americas caused predominantly by infection with serotypes Sin Nombre virus (SNV) and Andes virus (ANDV). The majority of hantavirus infections in humans are likely to be asymptomatic or present with mild and non-specific symptoms including fever, headache, blurred vision, gastrointestinal symptoms and back pain.

Known types of hantavirus associated with disease in Europe [4]
------------------------------------------------------
Virus / Disease / Distribution / Host species
DOBV / Severe / Eastern Europe / _ Apodemus flavicolis_
PUUV / Mild / Europe / _Myodes glareolus_
SAAV / Moderate / Europe / _Apodemus agrarius_
SEOV / Moderate / Worldwide / _Rattus norvegicus_

Hantavirus is notifiable in England and Wales. Laboratory confirmation of acute cases is provided by the Rare and Imported Pathogens Laboratory (RIPL), HPA Microbiology Services Porton. Between 2009 and 2010 there were 2 confirmed cases with no travel history recorded: one from London and one from the Yorkshire and the Humber region. In January 2012, a 2nd confirmed autochthonous case from Yorkshire and the Humber was reported with high titres (>10 000) and symptoms consistent with hantavirus infection (RIPL data).

Following the detection of a 2nd case in the Yorkshire and the Humber region, in collaboration with North Yorkshire and the Humber Health Protection Unit and the HPA's Rare and Imported Pathogens Laboratory (RIPL), an investigation led by Virology and Pathogenesis, HPA Microbiology Services Porton was undertaken. Trapping and testing of rodents from the patient's home led to the detection of the 1st UK strain of hantavirus in wild _Rattus norvegicus_ (brown rat) [5]. Further collaboration with the National Collection of Pathogenic Viruses (NCPV), Microbiology Services Porton, led to the culture and isolation of the virus now designated strain 'Humber.' Complete sequencing and genetic analysis confirmed the virus was a Seoul hantavirus.

Due to the high levels of cross-reactivity between hantavirus species and the lack of viral detection in any published UK study, it has previously been impossible to confirm and identify the presence of a hantavirus in the United Kingdom. Cases are likely to be under-reported due to mild cases presenting with non-specific symptoms and a lack of awareness of hantavirus as a potential diagnosis in the absence of travel. Given that _R. norvegicus_ are ubiquitous in the UK, research is ongoing to determine the extent of human exposure to this virus.

Further information on hantaviruses can be found on the HPA website [6]. This article is a contribution from Microbiology Research Services, HPA Porton.

[Although hantaviruses are globally distributed, this is the 1st detection of a hantavirus in the United Kingdom. The majority of hantavirus infections in humans are likely to be asymptomatic or present with mild and non-specific symptoms including fever, headache, blurred vision, gastrointestinal symptoms and back pain. The 1st 2 confirmed case of hantavirus infection in the United Kingdom had no travel histories and were located in London and the Humber region of Yorkshire, places where the indigenous brown rats might contact international trade routes. It is likely the introduced Seoul virus will gradually spread throughout the rest of the United Kingdom.

[The appearance of Seoul virus in England is not surprising, given its wide distribution around the world and the propensity of brown rats to move along routes of international commerce, most often by cargo ships, which accounts for the presence of Seoul virus in brown rats in port cities. Further movement around the UK can be expected. - Mod.TY]
