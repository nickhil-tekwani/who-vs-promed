AFP cases: 0
Environment: 5
Others: 0

New cVDPV isolates reported this week:
AFP cases: 41
Environment: 2
Others: 3

Headlines
----------
- Following the isolation of vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (VDPV2) in New York, USA, in July [2022], further virological and epidemiological analysis confirms circulation of this strain. It is important to note that since initial isolation of VDPV2, local and national public health authorities have already been operating on the assumption that this strain is circulating, and as such, this official classification at this time does not affect the operational response. New York and US public health authorities continue to implement a timely and appropriate response to this circulating VDPV2 (cVDPV2) in order to rapidly interrupt its circulation, including by continuing to intensify surveillance efforts (including for potential cases of paralysis), identifying population sub-groups/areas with potential immunity gaps, and proactively reaching out to communities with known immunity gaps to strengthen vaccination coverage.

- A WPV1-positive environmental sample is this week reported from greater Karachi, Sindh, with collection date on [23 Aug 2022], linked to WPV1 from southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Detection of virus in Karachi is not unexpected, given the large-scale and frequent population movements between Karachi and the rest of the country, in particular Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. See 'Pakistan' section below for further information.

- In the Democratic Republic of Congo, circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (cVDPV1) has been confirmed. The country is also co-infected with cVDPV2 and is continuing to conduct response to urgently stop both strains.

Summary of new polioviruses this week:
- Pakistan: 5 WPV1 positive environmental samples
- Côte d'Ivoire: 1 cVDPV2 positive environmental sample
- DR Congo: 4 cVDPV1 cases and 28 cVDPV2 cases
- Niger: 1 cVDPV2 positive environmental sample
- United States of America: 1 cVDPV2 case
- Yemen: 8 cVDPV2 cases

Afghanistan
- No new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) or circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) cases were reported this week. There is 1 WPV1 case reported in 2022 and 4 in 2021. The total number of cVDPV2 cases remains 43.
- Advance notification of a new case of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) from Afghanistan was received (to be officially reflected in next week's global data). The onset of paralysis was [29 Aug 2022], from Dara-e-Pech district, in Kunar province. Genetic sequencing is ongoing of the isolated virus to determine its origin and linkage to previously reported WPV1s.
- It is the 2nd WPV1 case from Afghanistan this year [2022]; the 1st was reported from Paktika province with onset of paralysis in January [2022].
- Kunar, along with the rest of the country's Eastern Region, is part of 1 of 3 critical cross-border epidemiological corridors with Pakistan, the northern corridor specifically comprising of Eastern Region and central Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in Pakistan. Case response is currently being planned in the immediate area and the broader corridor. The other 2 cross-border epidemiological corridors are the southern corridor, comprising Quetta Block of Pakistan and Southern Region, Afghanistan; and, the central corridor, comprising southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and South-East Region in Afghanistan.
- Of note, in 2022, the central corridor had multiple WPV1 detections from polio cases and environmental samples, mainly from southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
- Districts along the border of Pakistan and Afghanistan in the 3 epidemiological corridors are at high risk for poliovirus transmission, given the high proportion of zero-dose children and inconsistent quality of polio vaccination campaigns in some areas.
- The Pakistan and Afghanistan polio programmes continue to coordinate on surveillance and vaccination activities through the Global Polio Eradication Initiative Support Hub, based in Amman, Jordan.

Pakistan
- No wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases were reported this week. The number of cases in 2022 remain 17. In 2021, the number of WPV1 cases was 1 and the number of cVDPV2 cases was 8.
- 5 WPV1 positive environmental samples were reported: 3 in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and 1 each in Punjab and Sindh.
- The WPV1-positive environmental sample from Sindh is from greater Karachi, with collection date on [23 Aug 2022], linked to WPV1 from southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Detection of virus in Karachi is not unexpected, given the large-scale and frequent population movements between Karachi and the rest of the country, in particular Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
- Urgent efforts are underway, coordinated by the national and provincial Emergency Operations Centres (NEOC and PEOC), to continue surveillance efforts in greater Karachi and further boost immunity levels through health camps to prevent WPV1 from establishing a foothold in Pakistan's largest city.
- The humanitarian crisis following the unprecedented floods will pose graver challenges to Karachi and other high-risk districts of Pakistan in the foreseeable future, as millions of people are displaced and move to urban centres for refuge. Flooding can also facilitate and intensify virus transmission. The current circumstances, in addition to the high-transmission season for the poliovirus, sharply escalates the risk of WPV1 spreading further.
- The NEOC and PEOC have identified worst-affected districts and parts of Karachi, where 1200 health camps will be conducted. Each district will conduct 2 health camps per day over 25 days, while Karachi will conduct 100 camps over 5 days. These health camps will provide basic clinical services, particularly ensuring treatment of water-borne, vector-borne, and skin disease that are expected to be prevalent, and water purification tablets will be distributed. All routine immunization antigens will be provided to target children and pregnant women.
- Despite the extraordinary climatic conditions and consequent operational challenges aggravated by the collapse of infrastructure, the programme continued with the August [2022] polio campaign (including across Karachi) and readjusted the schedule in all accessible areas. While the immunization campaign could not be conducted in Balochistan and parts of Sindh, the effort managed to reach nearly 32 million children in the country, with health workers wading through deep water to reach children with the life-saving vaccine.

[As observed in the prior week's post and applicable to this post, poliovirus, both the wild virus (WPV1) and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus, continues to be identified globally. While Pakistan reported only positive environmental samples (ES), in section [2] below there are media reports of 2 newly confirmed cases in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. And Afghanistan is mentioned as advanced reporting of a newly confirmed WPV1 case. Other disconcerting news is the addition of the DR Congo to confirming outbreaks of both cVDPV1 and cVDPV2. And the USA has reported the cVDPV2 paralytic case we've covered in media and official reports.

A map showing the locations of each confirmed case of polio worldwide in the past 12 months can be found at https://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/. One can see cases of cVDPV in a band across Africa and in Israel, Ukraine, Tajikistan, Afghanistan, and Pakistan; cVDPV1 in DR Congo, Madagascar, and Yemen; and WPV1 in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Malawi, and Mozambique. - Mod.MPP]

http://outbreaknewstoday.com/pakistan-reports-18th-polio-case-98269/


A child aged 3 months has been paralyzed by wild poliovirus in North Waziristan, in the 18th case from Pakistan this year [2022].

The child suffering from polio-induced disabilities had onset of paralysis on [25 Aug 2022], the Pakistan National Polio Laboratory at the National Institute of Health confirmed on Saturday [10 Sep 2022].

Besides 2 cases from Lakki Marwat, all cases from Pakistan this year [2022] have been from North Waziristan.

Last week, a positive environmental sample for poliovirus was detected from Karachi, in addition to 4 other isolates from Bannu, Peshawar, Swat, and Lahore. Karachi, home to communities from across Pakistan, is a historic polio reservoir and remains among areas categorized by the programme at high risk of wild poliovirus transmission.

The humanitarian crisis in wake of the unprecedented floods will pose graver challenges to Karachi and other areas of Pakistan in the foreseeable future, as millions of people are displaced and move to urban centres for refuge. The large-scale movement of people, in addition to the high transmission season for the poliovirus, escalates the risk of wild poliovirus spreading.

"Despite the extreme climatic conditions, the Pakistan Polio Programme conducted immunization campaign wherever possible, and the programme is prepared to restart the campaign in the flood affected areas as soon as it becomes feasible," Federal Health Minister Qadir Patel said, adding that, "In the given circumstances, the risk of polio has only amplified."

National Emergency Operations Centre Coordinator, Dr. Shahzad Baig, said the programme has established health camps in 32 districts of the country to support the health needs of flood-affected populations.

These health camps will provide basic clinical services, particularly ensuring treatment of water-borne, vector-borne, and skin diseases that are expected to be prevalent. "All routine immunization antigens will also be provided to targeted children and pregnant women," Dr Baig said.

A 6-month-old boy has been paralyzed by wild poliovirus in South Waziristan district of Pakistan's northwest Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province (KP), the 19th case in the country this year [2022], the Health Ministry said on Friday [16 Sep 2022].

The child had onset of paralysis on [22 Aug 2022], the Pakistan National Polio Laboratory at the National Institute of Health confirmed on Thursday [15 Sep 2022], according to a statement from the ministry.

This was the 1st case from South Waziristan this year [2022]. All the cases in Pakistan this year [2022] were detected in KP, with 2 patients from Lakki Marwat, 16 from North Waziristan, and 1 from South Waziristan district.

Controlling the outbreak in KP remains the focus of the Pakistan Polio Program, the ministry said.

"The humanitarian crisis in the wake of floods poses graver challenges to polio eradication efforts as we grapple with the displacement of millions of people. This mass displacement will lead to the spread of wild poliovirus making it even more important to vaccinate children against polio," Health Minister Abdul Qadir Patel was quoted as saying in the statement.

A 6-month-old baby died recently due to poliovirus in Pakistan, officials said here on Friday [16 Sep 2022], as the country's effort to defeat the crippling disease seems to be failing.

The baby boy was from the South Waziristan tribal district in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, the health ministry said in a statement, adding that he had onset of paralysis in August [2022].

A total of 19 cases of poliovirus has been detected so far this year [2022] in Pakistan. All the cases were reported from Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province: 2 in Lakki Marwat, 16 in North Waziristan, and 1 in South Waziristan districts.

The health ministry said combating the outbreak of polio in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa is the main focus of the Pakistan Polio Programme.

Pakistan and Afghanistan are the only countries where polio, which in severe cases can be fatal or leave patients paralysed, remains endemic. Attempts to eradicate the crippling disease in Pakistan have been seriously hampered by deadly targeting of vaccination teams in recent years by militants, who oppose the drives, claiming that the polio drops cause infertility.

Meanwhile, Health Minister Abdul Qadir Patel in a statement said that en mass displacement of people due to floods is posing a threat of spread of poliovirus. "This mass displacement will lead to the spread of poliovirus. So it is very important to vaccinate children against polio," he said.

[Transmission of the WPV1 continues in Pakistan. The flooding disaster is contributing to control efforts, hampering vaccination activities, and, as mentioned above, the massive dislocation of population contributes to increasing exposures during the known high-transmission season of the virus.

The unfortunate death reported in section [C] is the 19th case reported in section [B] from South Waziristan.

[3] Algeria cVDPV2 case details
Date: Thu 16 Sep 2022

http://outbreaknewstoday.com/algeria-polio-the-first-cvdpv2-case-identified-93864/


According to the World Health Organization:
On [8 Jul 2022], WHO was notified of a case of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) with acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) from Tamanrasset province, southern Algeria. This represents the 1st cVDPV2 case identified in the country. Local public health authorities are conducting a field investigation, and an active search for additional AFP cases; a reactive immunization campaign is also planned.

Description of the outbreak
On [8 Jul 2022], a case of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) in Algeria was notified to WHO through the Global Polio Laboratory Network (GPLN). The case is a child under 2 years old from Tamanrasset province, southern Algeria, with onset of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) on [11 Apr 2022]. Stool specimens tested positive for cVDPV2 by the Pasteur Institute of Algeria and were confirmed by Pasteur Institute of Paris. Genomic sequencing analysis indicates that the isolated virus is genetically linked to a virus previously isolated in Kano, Nigeria. The child had not received any polio vaccine doses and has no history of travel outside Tamanrasset province.

This represents the 1st cVDPV2 case identified in Algeria, where, according to the 2021 WHO-UNICEF immunization coverage estimates, Pol3 (3rd dose of polio-containing vaccine) coverage was 91% and IPV1 (1 dose of the inactivated polio vaccine) coverage was 94%.

Detection of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus 2 (cVDPV2) in environmental samples - the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of America
-------------------------------------
Situation at a glance
In the past few months, there have been several genetically linked Sabin-like type 2 poliovirus (SL2) detections from environmental samples in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (hereafter the United Kingdom) and the United States of America.

In the United Kingdom, since February 2022, the WHO Global Polio Laboratory Network (GPLN) located at the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control (NIBSC) in London has consistently detected Sabin-like type 2 poliovirus isolates in sewage samples collected from London. Samples collected on 24 and 31 May [2022] had sufficient mutations to qualify as vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (VDPV2). Subsequently, due to a new detection of the virus more than 2 months later, these samples were classified as 'circulating' VDPV2 on [8 Aug 2022]. As of [5 Sep 2022], no human case associated with VDPV2 has been reported in the United Kingdom.

In the United States of America, Sabin-like type 2 poliovirus has been consistently detected in environmental samples collected between [21 Apr 2022 to 26 Aug 2022] from Rockland County, New York State, and nearby counties. In late July [2022], a case of VDPV2 was reported in an unvaccinated individual in Rockland County, who presented with paralysis. The case had no recent history of international travel. This is the 1st case of poliomyelitis reported in the country since 2013. Due to detection of environmental viral sequences (collected on [3 Aug 2022 and 11 Aug 2022]) containing more than 5 nucleotide changes, and both linked to the case reported in Rockland County, these viruses are now being classified as 'circulating' VDPV2.

The virus detected in environmental samples in New York State, United States of America, is genetically linked to viruses detected in sewage samples from London, United Kingdom, and in sewage samples collected between January to June 2022 from Jerusalem District, Israel [1].

Epidemiology of poliomyelitis
Polio is a highly infectious disease that largely affects children under 5 years of age, causing permanent paralysis (approximately 1 in 200 infections) or death (5-10% of those paralyzed).

The virus is transmitted from person to person, mainly through the fecal-oral route or, less frequently, by a common vehicle (e.g., contaminated water or food) and multiplies in the intestine, from where it can invade the nervous system and cause paralysis and death. Initial symptoms of polio include fever, fatigue, headache, vomiting, stiffness of the neck, and pain in the limbs. In a small proportion of cases, the disease causes paralysis, which is often permanent. There is no cure for polio, but it can be prevented by immunization.

The incubation period is usually 7-10 days but can range from 4-35 days. Up to 90% of those infected are either asymptomatic or experience only mild symptoms and the disease [and infection] often goes unrecognized.

Vaccine-derived poliovirus is a well-documented type of poliovirus that has mutated from the strain originally contained in the oral polio vaccine (OPV). The OPV contains a live, weakened form of poliovirus. On rare occasions, when replicating in the gastrointestinal tract, OPV strains genetically change and may spread in communities that are not fully vaccinated against polio, especially in areas where there is poor hygiene, poor sanitation, or overcrowding. Further changes occur as these viruses spread from person to person. The lower the population immunity, the longer this virus survives and the more genetic changes it undergoes. In very rare instances, the vaccine-derived virus can genetically change into a form that can paralyze; this is what is known as a vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV).

The detection of genetically linked VDPV in at least 2 different sources and at least 2 months apart, showing evidence of transmission in the community, should be classified as 'circulating' vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2). cVDPV2 continues to affect different areas of the world.

Public health response
WHO, in coordination with national authorities, will continue to evaluate the genetic and epidemiological situation to determine the possible spread of the virus and the potential risk associated with these isolates detected from different locations around the world.

Public health measures in the United Kingdom
The United Kingdom Health Security Agency (UKHSA) is conducting further investigations including assessing the public health risk and implementing response measures. These measures include:

- Strengthening the environmental, clinical, and laboratory surveillance for polio.
- A catch-up campaign targeted at children aged less than 5 years of age in London was implemented in June 2022, and a supplementary booster inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) campaign targeting children aged 1 to 9 years in London was launched in August 2022.
- Public health professionals, health professionals, and laboratory staff alerted to the detection of VDPV2 in London.
- Health professionals reminded of the importance of checking newly registered children and that adult routine immunizations are up-to-date, with an emphasis on under-immunized populations (new migrants, asylum seekers and refugees).
- Local and regional laboratories requested to refer all enterovirus-positive stool samples to the UKHSA.
- Enhancing environmental sampling to assess the extent of the spread of the virus across London. In addition, a range of additional sewage sampling sites are being stood up across the country.

Public health measures in the United States of America
- Enhancing polio wastewater surveillance.
- Ongoing activities to support polio vaccination and increase vaccination coverage in Rockland and Orange counties in New York State. Planning underway to launch an immunization campaign to provide IPV to residents of Rockland County who have potentially been exposed to poliovirus.
- Conducting testing for poliovirus in wastewater samples in New York and neighbouring states, as well as providing confirmatory testing for clinical specimens.
- Coordinating surveillance for acute flaccid myelitis (AFM) throughout the United States of America and enhancing surveillance for paralytic and non-paralytic polio in areas where poliovirus has been detected in wastewater.
- Health advisories including information on polio, the situation in New York State, and polio immunization, have been released to health providers and hospitals across the state and in the immediate county of residence of the case.
- On [9 Sep 2022], a state disaster emergency due to polio was declared in New York State. The declaration allows additional health professionals, such as pharmacists, to administer polio vaccine and allows health practitioners to issue standing orders for polio vaccinations.

WHO risk assessment
The emergence of cVDPV2 in the United Kingdom and in the United States of America is a reminder that until polio is eradicated, polio-free countries will remain at risk of polio reinfection or re-emergence. The detection of this VDPV2 strain underscores the importance of:

- Maintaining high levels of routine polio vaccination coverage at all levels and in all communities to minimize the risk and consequences of any poliovirus circulation.
- Having sensitive surveillance systems for the timely detection of VDPV importation or VDPV emergence.

Based on the WHO UNICEF estimates, the vaccine coverage for 3 routine doses of polio vaccine evaluated in children aged 12 months in the United Kingdom and United States of America were 93% and 92%, respectively, in 2021.

WHO will continue to support the ongoing investigation, risk assessment, and outbreak response by national authorities.

WHO advice
WHO reiterates to all Member States the importance of reaching and maintaining polio vaccination coverage of more than 95% in each district or municipality; maintaining high quality for 3 main surveillance indicators: acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) rate, percentage of cases investigated within 48 hours, and percentage of cases with an adequate sample; optimizing supplementary (environmental and enterovirus) poliovirus surveillance and updating national poliovirus outbreak response plans in order to rapidly detect and respond to new virus importations or VDPV emergence to minimize the consequences of poliovirus transmission and facilitate a rapid response.

The 32nd polio IHR Emergency Committee meeting held in June 2022, convened under the International Health Regulations (2005), agreed that the risk of international spread of poliovirus remains a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) and recommended the extension of Temporary Recommendations for a further 3 months.

[For an excellent discussion on the findings of environmental sampling in Jerusalem, see https://oicanadian.com/environmental-surveillance-helps-detect-poliovirus-type-2-outbreaks-in-israel/.

cVDPV2 has been isolated from environmental samples in NYC and Nassau County as well (https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/about/press/pr2022/nysdoh-and-nycdohm-wastewater-monitoring-finds-polio-urge-to-get-vaccinated.page, https://theisland360.com/featured/polio-detected-in-north-hempstead-wastewater-hochul-declares-state-emergency/).

The media are ripe with articles of locations around the world that are beginning environmental sampling for poliovirus. Many localities in the UK and the USA have begun sampling, an effort that should have been part of eradication activities, given the extreme stealth nature of this virus with less than 5% of infections resulting in neurologic disease that might prompt culturing for the virus.

Unfortunately, this event is vaccine related and the media also have misinformation reports . . . As I mused in a previous post, hopefully the use of OPV is being reassessed as more cases of acute flaccid paralysis globally are now attributable to reversion of neurovirulence of the vaccine virus than the wild poliovirus. - Mod.MPP]
