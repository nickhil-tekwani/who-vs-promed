The [Taiwan] Centers for Disease Control yesterday [29 Mar 2016] said gonorrhea cases climbed 37 percent last year [2015], with a high rate of increase observed among teens. "A total of 3584 confirmed gonorrhea cases were reported last year [2015], an increase of 37 percent from the previous year [2014]," Chronic Infectious Diseases Division chief Huang Yen-fang said.

The number of reported cases among adolescents aged 10 to 19 increased 47 percent last year [2015], with the youngest cases involving 13-year-olds (2 male and 2 female), Huang said, adding that due to a small base of comparison for underaged girls, the increase for the demographic was 107 percent last year.

Although men accounted for 93.5 percent of all reported gonorrhea cases, with male cases increasing by 36 percent last year [2015], cases involving women rose by 41 percent, she added.

Gonorrhea affects the reproductive system, and symptoms in men include a burning or painful sensation during urination, which might develop between 2 and 7 days after infection, the agency said. Women often do not develop any overt symptoms, so infections can go undetected, it said. However, without prompt treatment, gonorrhea can lead to infertility in both men and women, it said, adding that people should practice safe sex to prevent contraction of sexually transmitted diseases.

Previous reports showed that men were often the 1st to seek medical attention, later informing their female partners after their diagnosis with gonorrhea, Huang said. The agency advised people to be careful who they make friends with on the Internet; refrain from having unsafe sex with people whose sexual history they are unfamiliar with; avoid sex parties and multiple sexual partners; use condoms and water-based lubricants at all times when having sex; and avoid narcotics.

[The news report above says that men accounted for 93.5 percent of all reported gonorrhea cases in Taiwan in 2015, with male cases increasing by 36 percent and female cases increasing by 41 percent over the previous year.

Gonococcal infection is caused by a sexually acquired Gram-negative diplococcal bacterial pathogen, _Neisseria gonorrhoeae_. _N. gonorrhoeae_ may be acquired at multiple mucosal sites in the lower urogenital tract, as well as the anorectal canal, pharynx, and conjunctivae. Urogenital tract infections are most common.

Because, unlike men, more than 95 percent of women with gonococcal infection do not have any symptoms, the presence of gonococcal infection in women can be underreported. Screening for gonococcal infection in asymptomatic women is critical to appreciate its true occurrence in women. Routine urogenital screening is recommended annually in the US for all sexually active women at risk for infection, including women under 25 years of age and older women with one or more of the following risks: a previous gonococcal infection, the presence of other sexually transmitted diseases, new or multiple sex partners, inconsistent condom use, commercial sex work, drug use, or human immunodeficiency virus infection with sexual activity, or pregnancy. How are women in Taiwan being screened for gonococcal infection?

Pharyngeal gonococcal infections, common in adolescents, as well as rectal infections, are also predominantly asymptomatic, and specific screening is necessary to identify affected individuals.

Although asymptomatic urethral infections in men may occur in at least 10 percent of cases, most men with gonococcal infection usually are symptomatic, which may account for the much higher proportion of gonococcal infections in men than women reported in Taiwan. Other reasons may be transmission in men who have sex with men (MSM), but other factors may also be at play, such as increased screening for _N. gonorrhoeae_ infections or increased screening at extra-genital anatomic sites in men, or changes in reporting practices that resulted in increased case ascertainment in men. - Mod.ML

If men cured of the disease are going to be re-infected by their asymptomatic partners, it would be important to screen and treat their partners, as is done for HIV, wouldn`t it? - Mod.JW
