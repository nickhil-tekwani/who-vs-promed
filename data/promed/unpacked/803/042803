The most widespread outbreak of bird botulism poisoning in decades is,
according to this story, killing Alberta waterfowl by the thousands. Since
mid-summer, 45,000 waterfowl mainly ducks have died from avian botulism, a
type of food poisoning birds suffer when they eat contaminated maggots and
other insects.
Margo Pybus, a biologist with Alberta Environmental Protection was cited as
saying that thousands of waterfowl die each year from the naturally
occurring form of poisoning. A death cycle begins when maggots feed on the
carcasses of ducks or other waterfowl that have died naturally or from
eating blue-green algae. The maggots acquire the botulism toxin, but are
immune to it. Waterfowl then feed on the contaminated maggots and drown or
suffocate as the toxin paralyzes their nervous systems.
