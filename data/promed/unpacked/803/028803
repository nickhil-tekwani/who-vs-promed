Cases of anthrax have been found again in France. 38 cattle on 18
farms perished in the Doubs region in eastern France due to infection
with the pathogen _Bacillus anthracis_.

Since the 1st occurrence in early July 2008, the pathogen has spread
further. The veterinary authorities have thus undertaken the
vaccination of cattle and sheep in 25 districts, as reported by Agra
Europe, London on 14 Aug 2008.

It is estimated that 9000 animals must be vaccinated. In addition,
the hunting season has been delayed, forestry work discontinued and
access to old animal burial sites, which are suspected to be the
source of infection, banned.

[Anthrax is sporadic in France, with usually only a couple (1-3)
outbreaks in cattle each year. There were 2 outbreaks in 2005, 3 in
2006 (in Canbtal (2) and Savoie (1)), and the data for 2007 have yet
to be posted to WAHID, OIE. The problem when the disease is sporadic
is that farm livestock vaccination is foregone, which is
understandable, but also that veterinarians either forget to have it
on their list of "possibles," or the newly-qualified have not had it
drummed into their heads as something to consider. As a result, the
sudden deaths are perceived to be blackquarter, which is, frankly, 10
times more common anywhere, and samples are submitted for anaerobic
culture, which results in a 10-day or longer delay in diagnosis, and
thus response.

There are no prior postings to ProMED for France. - Mod.MHJ]
