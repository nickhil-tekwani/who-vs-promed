The 25 June issue of Nature contains an article by C Redmond, MJ Pearce, RJ
Manchee, of CAMR, UK, and BR Berdal, of The Norwegian Military Microbiology
Laboratory, Norway, entitled "Deadly relic of the Great War" (Scientific
correspondence) p 747.
The following account of that paper is extracted from the New York Times

"Norway's 1918 Lump of Sugar Yields Clues on Anthrax in War"
Historians have often said Germany engaged in widespread germ warfare in
World War I, especially against Allied horses, which were critical to many
aspects of the war effort. But the evidence was usually sketchy, and
Germany often denied the reports vehemently. [In fact their BW campaign
using the organisms for glanders and anthrax in Argentina (Buenos Aires),
USA (New York), Rumania, and in France is well documented. - MHJ]
The new detective work, by four scientists from the British germ-defense
unit and the Norwegian military, began when the curator of a police museum
in Trondheim, Norway, found in an archive a bottle with two sugar lumps. An
attached note translated, "A piece of sugar containing anthrax bacilli,
found in the luggage of Baron Otto Karl von Rosen, when he was apprehended
in Karasjok in January 1917, suspected of espionage" and contained a tiny
sealed glass tube. Alarmed, he sent the exhibition to Norwegian defense
authorities, whose scientists set in motion the detailed analysis.
The glass tube was broken open and its contents cultured. Their
identification as _Bacillus anthracis_ was confirmed by two separate
methods, including one that amplifies and examines the molecular structure
of an organism's genetic material, or DNA. "It proved possible," the
article said, "to revive a few surviving organisms from the brink of
extinction after they had been stored, without any special precautions."
One intriguing question, the scientists said, is what the Baron -- "a
Swedish/German/Finnish aristocrat" -- and his colleagues intended to do
with the anthrax. After the Baron had been expelled to Sweden as a result
of diplomatic pressure, a belated inspection of his baggage produced
bottles of deadly curare, microbial cultures and 19 sugar lumps. It appears
that the tested lump was the only surviving weapon in that small arsenal.
The scientists say the Baron's mysterious companions admitted that they had
been organized by the Germans for sabotage.
The scientists say that Berlin had approved a microbial assault on reindeer
used for sledging British arms across northern Norway [to Vladivostok]. And
local newspapers of the day were convinced that the deadly sugar cubes were
also used to poison horses involved in war transport.
"The grinding of the sugar and its glass insert between the molar teeth of
horses would probably result in a lethal infection," the scientists wrote,
though it is unknown whether such killing was ever attempted or successful.
The scientists added that it was unclear whether reindeer eat sugar lumps.

[An interesting aspect of this report is the sugar cubes. A British
Admiralty Room-40 decipherment of German messages to their agent in Buenos
Aires described a shipment of cultures from Madrid included the information
that the cultures were in "sugar cubes". Now we know why and how. During
WWII the British used the same idea when they prepared a large volume of
dairy cattle nuts into which holes had been drilled and short capillary
tubes filled with anthrax spores inserted. These were to be dropped from
bombers if the need had arisen. Fortunately they were never used. - Mod.MHJ]
