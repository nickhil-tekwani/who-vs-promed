Wine industry leaders say some growers have given up hope of
harvesting a crop this season, as conditions for fungal disease are
continuing to worsen.

There are severe shortages of sprays that can be applied to kill
downy mildew once vines are infected, and the ongoing rain has added
to the difficulty of applying preventative sprays.

Winegrowers says wineries are still not releasing prices for the
coming season, but some growers realise it is not economic to
continue trying to control the disease.

[Downy mildew on grapevine is caused by the fungus _Plasmopara
viticola_. It causes lesions on leaves which later become necrotic,
and it can also affect flowers and fruits. In years with warm,
extended wet periods during bloom, fruit clusters may be partially or
totally destroyed. The disease can cause severe crop losses.

Spores are spread within a crop mainly by splashing rain, wind, or
mechanical means. The fungus survives between crops on infected plant
debris as oospores, which are formed inside the host tissues. It is
an obligate parasite and cannot be cultured _in vitro_. Disease
management relies mainly on preventative fungicide applications
according to forecasting services; systemic fungicides are also available.

Downy mildew has also affected the adjacent South Australian grape
growing region (ProMED-mail post 20101117.4164). The current outbreak
is considered by the industry to be the worst in 20 years. Some
growers have already been devastated by downy mildew affecting their
whole crop, and it is feared that the damage will see more growers
leave the land.
