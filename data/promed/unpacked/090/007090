From: Edward Schroder <schroder@usa.healthnet.org>
It has been suggested to ProMED-mail that some human rabies cases that
present after exposure to bats, but without a clear indication that the
person has been bitten, might be explained by exposure to bat urine,
aerosolized while the animal is flying. Do any of our subscribers have
information or opinions about the likelihood of infection via this route?
Please send all responses to promed@usa.healthnet.org.
