*Balclutha Horse Syndrome* Not Caused By Exotic Disease
Test results from overseas indicate that the [New Zealand horse condition
which has been dubbed "Balclutha Horse Syndrome" is not caused by an exotic
disease.
The results from Pirbright in Britain were negative for all serious exotic
diseases tested for. These included tests for vesicular stomatitis and
vesicular exanthema. Initial results from further virus isolation tests
carried out at Plum Island in the United States for exotic viruses have
also been negative.
The overseas results confirm the results from preliminary tests carried out
in at [New Zealand MAF's central animal health laboratory at Wallaceville.
The only positive result returned was for equine herpes in one horse. This
is considered to be a possible cause of the condition, but has not been
confirmed.
Equine herpes is endemic (i.e. well-established and widespread) in this
country [New Zealand and around the world. It can be triggered in horses by
the stress of being put in new surroundings and with unfamiliar horses.
In early March, the [New Zealand Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry
isolated two neighbouring properties near Balclutha, while it investigated
an unexplained ailment among horses there.
Of the 29 horses on one property, 15 had small shallow lesions on their
tongues and gums, and two had small, coldsore-like blisters, on their gums.
Three horses on the adjacent property all had lesions in their mouths. The
horses in question have remained otherwise healthy and blood tests from them
were normal.
In light of the overseas test results, restricted place notices on the
properties have now been lifted.
It is Ministry's policy to carry out routine investigations whenever animals
suffer unexplained illness or ailments.
