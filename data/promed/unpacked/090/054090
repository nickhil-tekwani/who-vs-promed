The Dominican Republic reported 148 cases of leprosy last year [2021], the lowest figure in recent times, according to media reports. According to the media, since the creation of the Huberto Bogaert Dermatological Institute in 1966, 14 321 cases of leprosy have been recorded in the Dominican Republic, but over time the number of those infected has dropped drastically, from 500 cases in 1974 to 177 in 2020, and 148 in 2021.

In the Americas, more than 20 countries report cases of leprosy, some with more than 100 per year; Brazil accounts for most of the cases registered in the entire region.

Leprosy is caused by the bacterium _Mycobacterium leprae_, also known as Hansen's bacillus, which multiplies very slowly, and the average incubation time for the disease is 5 years. In some people, the symptoms can appear 9 months after acquiring the infection and in others, it can take up to 20 years. Leprosy is curable with multidrug therapy (dapsone, rifampin, and clofazimine), a combination that kills the pathogen, cures the patient, and stops transmission.

[Leprosy has been reported in 24 countries in the Americas region, which accounted for about 15% of all new leprosy cases in 2018, that is, 30 957 of 208 619 new cases; 8 countries in the Americas Region report more than 100 cases each year (Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Mexico, Paraguay, and Venezuela). 94% of new cases in 2018 were reported in Brazil (https://www.paho.org/en/topics/leprosy); 5% of new cases were in children, implying recent transmission and 7.5% of new cases were in people with visible deformity due to leprosy, implying delayed case finding.

Leprosy is likely transmitted via droplets, from the nose and mouth, during close and frequent contact with untreated cases. Damage to the peripheral nerves, as demonstrated by loss of sensation and mobility to hand, feet or face. The disease eventually results in deformities that would be preventable by earlier antimicrobial drug treatment. Elimination of leprosy depends on early case finding and immediate placement on multidrug antibiotic therapy (dapsone, rifampicin, and clofazimine). Once on multidrug treatment, patients are no longer contagious. The drug treatment for leprosy is free. - Mod.ML
