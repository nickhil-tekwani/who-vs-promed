The nationwide cyclospora outbreak has now sickened 641 people and hospitalized 41, according to the latest update by the CDC.

That's an increase of 5 since the last update last week, which indicates the outbreak may be slowing down. No deaths have been reported.

The number of cases in each area is as follows: Texas (282), Iowa (156), Nebraska (86), Florida (32), Wisconsin (16), Illinois (11), Arkansas (10), Georgia (5), Missouri (5), New York City (5), Kansas (4), Louisiana (3), Connecticut (2), Michigan (1), Minnesota (2), New Jersey (4), New York (2), Ohio (2), Virginia (3), California (1), New Hampshire (1), South Dakota (1), Tennessee (1), and Wyoming (1). The patient age range remains from less than one year to 92 years, with a median age of 51 years; 56 percent of infected persons are female. The case count includes anyone who became ill before 28 Jul 2013.

The cases in Iowa and Nebraska are linked to a salad mix produced by Taylor Farms de Mexico and served at Red Lobster and Olive Garden restaurants. The case count in Texas, which is the highest in the country, may not be connected to Taylor Farms de Mexico, and all cases are not necessarily related to each other.

The CDC recommends that consumers eat fresh fruits and vegetables, but wash them thoroughly before preparing and eating, and follow safe produce handling recommendations.

[The report communicates the latest update from the CDC website (http://www.cdc.gov/parasites/cyclosporiasis/outbreaks/investigation-2013.html) updated on 4 Sep 2013. The epidemic curve over the weekly number of cases clearly shows that the outbreak peaked in the beginning of July; the CDC website also includes a map showing the distribution of cases in each state. Apparently, the outbreak had several sources, which is surprising. The investigation of the source(s) has not yet been completed. - Mod.EP
