The Laboratory of Biomedical and Health Basic Technology Research
Center has confirmed a positive bird flu H5N1 [avian influenza
A/(H5N1) virus infection]. The victim is a 22-month-old female child
from Bekasi, West Java province.

The child started to feel sick on 2 Mar 2011 with signs of fever and
coughing. She was brought to a bird flu referral hospital in East
Jakarta and immediately treated in a bird flu isolation unit and given
standard therapy. The victim had been discharged from the hospital, as
her general condition had improved, and chest X-ray showed improvement
of lung condition.

A risk factor was the rearing of ornamental birds communally in the
child's neighborhood. The Indonesian Research Center for Veterinary
Science in Bogor has taken samples from the birds and confirmed them
positive for H5N1 [avian influenza].

The Directorate General of Disease Control and Environmental Health,
as the focal point of International Health Regulation, has informed
the case to WHO.
