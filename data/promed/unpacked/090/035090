This report comes from Vanga Hospital in the Democratic Republic of Congo
(former Zaire) where two cases of encephalopathy of undetermined etiology
presented this week at this 400 bed mission hospital located in the
interior of the Republic of Congo 80 kilometers upriver from Kikwit .
Two school age children from different villages in the Vanga Health
District (5-7 kilometers apart) presented to the reference hospital with
symptoms consistent with a viral gastroenteritis. Both evolved rapidly
into a coma. The first child died within 48 hours, the second is at present
still comatose. The children attended different schools and secured water
and food from different sources. No family members to date have contracted
this illness.
The cases are as follows:
Patient 1 (hospitalized 12/18/97)
The first patient, an eight year old boy from the village Songo, 6 km from
Vanga fell ill on a Friday after school and died 2 days later on Sunday
evening. The child in otherwise good health had been seen at Vanga
Hospital five days earlier for a sprained ankle sustained while playing
soccer. He was given aspirin and an ace bandage. On the first day of his
illness he experienced colicky abdominal pain with persistent vomiting. He
was treated locally with chloramphenicol and an anti-spasmodic (papaverine)
The following day he was referred to the Vanga Hospital where clinical
exam by a physician suggested viral gastroenteritis in an otherwise healthy
child. He was afebrile, a malaria smear was negative and white blood count
was 12,150mm3. The child was hospitalized for observation. Chloramphenical
and an antispasmodic were continued.
Early the following morning the night nurse found the boy in a deep coma
and signaled the physician on call. The child was febrile (38 C) with
tachycardia (120) and tachypnea (48). He was unresponsive to all stimuli.
Pupils were dilated and [un?]responsive to light. Diffuse hypotonia and
hyporeflexia were noted. Babinski test was negative. Lungs were clear and
heart sounds normal. The liver edge was smooth and palpated 3cm below the
costal margin; spleen was not enlarged. No icterus was noted. Urine was
negative for bilirubin. A spinal tap revealed 2 white cells and 408 red
cells, no trypanosomes were found on a centrifuged specimen. Malaria smear
again was negative. A blood sugar was 97. An anticholinesterase agent
(neostigmine) was given without effect. The child was started empirically
on intravenous quinine and dextrose. He remained in a coma and died later
that day.
Patient 2 (hospitalized 12/26/97)
The second child, a six-year-old girl from the village of Bilili, 11 km
from Vanga developed a low grade fever, abdominal pain and vomiting 5 days
prior to her presentation to this hospital. She was treated at a local
clinic with...
