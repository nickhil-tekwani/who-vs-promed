A new suspected [case] of [a] hantavirus [infection] in Purranque [Los Lagos region] was taken to the Temuco hospital [Araucanía region]. The affected individual is a 24 year old agricultural worker who had contracted the virus in Purranque. After testing positive in the rapid test, the man was immediately taken to Temuco, where he is currently.

In dialogue with Radio Sago, the Health SEREMI [Secretaria Regional Ministerial de Salud; local ministerial unit] provincial chief, Teresita Cancino, stated that the young man from the Crucero area worked in the dairy sector. He first went to the Alemana Clinic and later was taken to the San Jose Hospital in Osorno [Los Lagos region] and then was sent to Araucanía.

Cancino stated that this year [2017], 7 cases of confirmed positive hantavirus [infections] have been registered in Osorno province; of these, 3 died, while in the [Los Lagos] region there is a total of 17 confirmed cases of which 6 died.

The provincial chief of the health SEREMI called on the community to adopt all the preventive measures, such as immediately going to a health center if presenting with symptoms such as fever, muscle pain, vomiting, diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain and headache.

[The positive rapid test is good a preliminary diagnosis of Andes virus infection. The specific situation under which the young man acquired his hantavirus infection is not stated. As a dairy farm worker, he no doubt came into contact with areas inhabited by the rodent reservoir of the virus. The numbers of cases of hantavirus infections in the Los Lagos region continue to increase this year (2017).

Although not specified in this or previous reports from the region, the hantavirus involved in these cases no doubt is Andes virus. This virus is endemic in Chile, including the Los Lagos region, and cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome occur every year. Andes virus is rarely transmitted directly person-to-person and if it does is only with very close physical contact, usually within the family. The commonest source of the infection is the long-tailed pygmy rice rat.

Images of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_), the sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus, can be seen at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligoryzomys_longicaudatus#/media/File:Raton_colilarga.jpg.
