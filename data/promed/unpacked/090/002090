H5N1 sickens Egyptian woman
---------------------------
A 40-year-old Egyptian woman from Menofia governorate who became ill after contact with sick poultry tested positive for H5N1 avian influenza, according to a Thu 21 Mar 2013 report from the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). She got sick on 3 Mar 2013 a few days after close contact with sick and dead backyard ducks and chickens. If the World Health Organization (WHO) confirms the case, the woman's illness will be counted as Egypt's 171st case, of whom 61 have been fatal.

The tests were conducted at Egypt's Central Public Health Laboratories. News of her illness appeared in the FAO's monthly Emergency Center for Transboundary Animal Diseases (ECTAD) highly pathogenic avian flu situation update. Egypt has had only one other H5N1 case this year, a fatal one.
