Unexplained animal deaths in Laos puzzle farmers
------------------------------------------------
Farmers in Nathong village, in Laos' Vientiane province, are concerned
by the deaths of their livestock for no apparent reason.

A local resident said 6 of his buffalo and 3 cattle died after it
rained at the beginning of this month [January 2010]. He had no clue
why the animals had died, and said it was the 1st time it happened. He
suspected the reason might be the excessive use of herbicide on a
nearby rubber plantation and upland rice fields. Villagers were ready
to harvest their wet season rice after the livestock were put out to
graze in the fields [see comment below].

When it rains, the chemical-laden herbicides sprayed on the grass run
downhill into pasture land, and this may be the reason the livestock
fell ill and died.

[The man] said the owners of the animals that died were preparing to
vaccinate their livestock against cold season diseases [see further].

Other livestock in nearby communities including Mouk village have also
died, but there has been no confirmation of the reason for the
animals' deaths.

So far no provincial or government officials have visited the area to
investigate the cattle deaths, and [the farmer] said he was afraid
more animals would die.

While the deaths won't affect the supply of meat to markets, it is a
small tragedy for local people, whose already meager income is reduced
still further.

From October to December last year [2009] the provincial livestock
and fisheries section worked with district authorities to vaccinate
3500 buffalo and cattle in Vientiane against cold season diseases,
especially haemorrhagic fever [this most probably relates to
hemorrhagic septicaemia (HS); see ProMED-mail 20090526.1961] and
anthrax, said section head Soumkham Southammavong.

Every year buffalo and cattle in Vientiane province die from
haemorrhagic fever as only 20 percent of animals have been vaccinated.
This falls far short of the yearly plan for 70-80 percent of livestock
to be immunised.

[The article provides no evidence of what herbicides may be used or
whether they are used in pre-flood or post-flood conditions on the
rice. I suspect an arsenic based product and/or an
organophosphate/carbamate based product.

[The worst HS epidemics are known to occur in Southeast Asia during
the rainy season, in animals in poor physical condition. Stresses such
as a poor food supply are thought to increase susceptibility to
infection, and close herding and wet conditions seem to contribute to
the spread of the disease. _Pasteurella multocida_ can survive for
hours and possibly days in damp soil or water. Results of
epidemiological investigations and possible laboratory tests are
requested. - Mod.AS]
