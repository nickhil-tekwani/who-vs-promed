DUSHANBE, Tajikistan -- Health officials fear this central Asian nation
is on the verge of an anthrax epidemic after some 200 cases of the deadly
disease were registered. Medical officials told local reporters Thursday
that the disease had appeared in several regions and there were concerns it
would spread. The disease usually comes from infected cattle.
Efforts to contain the outbreaks were being hindered by a shortage of
medicine [vaccine to deal with the disease because of a serious lack of
funds, the officials said.
There have been anthrax cases in recent years, but they were contained by
vaccination and other preventative measures.

humans - Mod.JW
