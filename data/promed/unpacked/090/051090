Rift Valley fever in a German tourist returning from South Africa,
preliminary report
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Briefly, the case patient was a 50 year old woman visiting the Republic of
South Africa between 17 Mar and 8 Apr 2010. The patient travelled (as part
of a group) from Port Elizabeth through rural areas along the southern
coast of South Africa (Eastern and Western Cape provinces). She visited
safari parks and mountain areas. Nights were spent in hotels or lodges.
Towards the end of the trip, the group visited Cape Town for a few days.
She fell ill on 7 Apr 2010, the day before returning to Germany. Symptoms
included fever up to 39 deg C [102.2 deg F], slight thrombocytopenia,
headache, conjunctivitis, swollen inguinal lymph nodes, a slight
macula-papulous exanthema on both legs, and a discrete hemorrhagic
exanthema of the abdominal skin, as well as vesicular efflorescences on the
feet. Hospital [admission] was not required. Blood samples tested positive
for Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus-specific IgM and IgG; RT-PCR was
negative. Based on the currently available data, it is likely that the case
patient acquired a RVF infection in South Africa. Further laboratory
analyses, both in Germany and in South Africa, are in progress.

The German public health authorities still consider the risk of RVF virus
infection for tourists visiting South Africa to be small. Tourists are
recommended to observe mosquito protection measures (repellents, nets, long
clothing) even outside of endemic areas and during the day. Close contact
with wild and domestic animals (especially raw meat, blood, faeces, urine,
placenta tissue) should be avoided. Uncooked meat and raw milk should not
be consumed (heated meats and pasteurized milk are fine). If fever develops
within a month after leaving South Africa, a physician should be visited
and made aware of the travel history.

[The vast majority of human Rift Valley fever virus infections result from
direct or indirect contact with the blood or organs of infected animals.
The virus can be transmitted to humans through the handling of animal
tissue during slaughtering or butchering, assisting with animal births,
conducting veterinary procedures, or from the disposal of carcasses or
fetuses. Certain occupational groups such as herders, farmers,
slaughterhouse workers, and veterinarians are therefore at higher risk of
infection.

Human infections have also resulted from the bites of infected mosquitoes,
most commonly the _Aedes_ mosquito, and by hematophagous flies. It may be
that this tourist acquired infection by this route.

Human-to-human transmission of Rift Valley fever virus infection has not
been documented, and no transmission to health care workers has been
reported when standard infection control precautions have been put in
place. Most human cases of Rift Valley fever are relatively mild and of
short duration, and no specific treatment is required for these patients.
For the more severe cases, the predominant treatment is general supportive
therapy (see <http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs207/en/index.html>).
