The Indian government confirmed on Thursday [26 Jul 2007] that the
latest outbreak of bird flu in poultry in the remote northeast of the
country was of the dangerous H5N1 strain.
"It has been confirmed as the H5N1 strain," Joint Secretary in the
Ministry of Health Vineet Chawdhry told Reuters.
Hundreds of health workers will fan out in Manipur state to check on
the health of some 450 000 people in and around the affected poultry
farm in the village of Chingmeirong on the outskirts of Imphal, the
state capital.
None of the people in the poultry unit or veterinary workers dealing
with the outbreak are showing flu symptoms, but they have been put on
the anti-flu drug Tamiflu just in case, Chawdhry said.
The confirmation of the H5N1 strain came after authorities received
the results from 2 government laboratories.
India declared itself bird flu free last August [2006] after 2 major
outbreaks of the H5N1 virus in chickens in western India. It culled
around a million birds to contain those outbreaks.
It plans to slaughter some 150 000 poultry in a 5-km (3-mile) radius
around the affected farm.
India has had no human case of bird flu.
Neighboring Bangladesh, Myanmar and Pakistan have also witnessed
outbreaks of the H5N1 strain of bird flu this year [2007].

[The OIE notification includes a map showing the location of Chingmeirong.
Reportedly, the sampling took place on 11 and 16 Jul 2007; H5N1 was
confirmed on 24 Jul 2007. This is a rather lengthy waiting period for
an important animal disease with potential public health
implications. - Mod.AS]
