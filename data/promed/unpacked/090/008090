[In relation to the ProMED-mail report "Hendra virus, human, equine -
Australia: (QLD) 20080715.2146" Dr Peter Black has provided the following
update on the animal health-related content of the report]

Hendra virus infection of horses has occurred in a number of locations in
eastern Australia as summarized in the table below.

Location / Cases / Time
Mackay, Queensland / 2 horses / August 1994
Hendra, Queensland / 20 horses / September 1994
Cairns, Queensland / 1 horse / January 1999
Cairns, Queensland / 1 horse / October 2004
Townsville, Queensland / 1 horse / December 2004
Peachester, Queensland / 1 horse / June 2006 /
Murwillumbah, New South Wales / 1 horse / October 2006
Peachester, Queensland / 1 horse / June 2007
Clifton Beach, Queensland / 1 horse / July 2007
Redlands, Queensland / 4 horses / June 2008
Cannonvale, Queensland / 1 horse / July 2008

This table shows that the cases have not been limited to the Brisbane area
of Queensland. Also please note that an unrelated case of Hendra virus
infection was confirmed on 14 Jul 2008, in a horse that died at Cannonvale
near Proserpine in North Queensland. The horse at Cannonvale has no
connection to the cases at the Redlands veterinary hospital in Queensland.
The Cannonvale property is being placed under routine quarantine.
Investigations are continuing on this property.

The Redlands veterinary hospital has been quarantined and decontaminated.
There is no evidence at this stage that the 37 horses that are quarantined
on the premises are infected, but follow-up tests are being conducted.
Tracing has been finalised on horses that have recently left the Redlands
veterinary hospital and all appear well. This is not the 1st time that
Queensland has dealt with 2 unrelated cases of Hendra in the same year as
shown in the table. As in previous incidents, the disease has not spread
beyond the affected premises.

Industries website
