The Chilean hatchery Camanchaca notified the detection of Infectious Salmon Anemia (ISA) virus in 3 of their cages, in the Aysen region.

This diagnosis was attained by laboratory analyses conducted by the Chilean National Fisheries Service (Sernapesca), during the execution of an ISA surveillance and control program. The company informed them that they had already confirmed the presence of a non-virulent strain (HPR0) in 2012.

Camanchaca stated that when genomic sequencing is completed the finding by Sernapesca "possibly" confirms the presence of a virulent strain, as virulent ISA was found in a neighboring hatchery. "This is an expected situation under the prevailing conditions in the region", said the letter.

The company said that it has already submitted a harvest plan for the 3 infected cages, which will be finalized in the next 10 days.

This measure will not have an economic impact because the harvest was planned for end of May and June, anyway, and therefore the fish have the proper size to go out to the market.

All hatcheries that have operative centers in the neighborhood have to complete all havests in July.

The positive results were detected in the absence of clinical signs.

[ISA is a disease of Atlantic salmon (_Salmo salar_) caused by an orthomyxovirus and affects mainly fish maintained in marine water or exposed to the sea. Although no clinical signs are reported here, the disease can be systemic and lethal, characterized by severe anemia and hemorrhages in several organs. It is a disease of great economic impact for the salmon industry,and is of obligatory notification to the OIE.
