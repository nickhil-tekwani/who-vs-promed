Congo is seeing an upsurge in cases of the plague, as the vast Central African nation also battles outbreaks of COVID-19 and Ebola. Since June 2020, Congo has recorded at least 65 cases of the plague, including at least 10 deaths, in the eastern Ituri province according to Ituri provincial chief of health Dr. Louis Tsolu.

While the plague is endemic in Ituri province, the number of cases is increasing and has already surpassed the total recorded in 2019 which had 48 cases and 8 deaths, according to WHO.

The new plague outbreak appears to have started in June 2020 when a 12-year-old girl in the Rethy health zone died with symptoms related to the plague -- headache, cough, enlarged lymph nodes, and a fever. More deaths in that area were later recorded with symptoms of the plague, which manifests in 3 different forms: bubonic, septicemic and pneumonic.

This year [2020], health workers are finding it difficult to assist people in eastern Congo because of insecurity caused by armed militias. The plague cases have also increased while Congo is also fighting COVID-19, which has infected more than 10 100 people and killed at least 260. There is also an Ebola outbreak in the western Equateur province, which has killed 43 people, although in June 2020, Congo succeeded in bringing to an end a larger Ebola outbreak in the east that lasted for nearly 2 years and killed nearly 2300 people.

The plague is mostly endemic in Congo, Peru and Madagascar, which saw a large outbreak in 2017 with more than 2300 cases and 202 deaths, according to WHO.

[Most cases are due to bubonic plague following the bite of an infected rodent flea causing a swollen and very tender lymph gland. The swollen gland is called a bubo. Bubonic plague should be suspected when a person develops a swollen gland, fever, chills, headache, and extreme exhaustion, and has a history of possible exposure to infected rodents, rabbits, or fleas. A person usually becomes ill with bubonic plague 2 to 6 days after being bitten.

When bubonic plague is left untreated, plague bacteria invade the bloodstream. The bacteremia can also occur as an initial event. As the plague bacteria multiply in the bloodstream, they spread rapidly throughout the body and cause a severe and often fatal condition. Infection of the lungs with the plague bacterium causes the pneumonic form of plague, a severe respiratory illness. The infected person may experience high fever, chills, cough, and breathing difficulty and may expel bloody sputum. If plague patients are not given specific antibiotic therapy, the disease can progress rapidly to death. - Mod.LL
