I'd like to comment on the above paper that was recently published in JAMA
and reviewed in ProMED-mail Digest (December 22). Kawayama et al. have
shown that levels of (1-->3)-beta-D-glucan, one of the major components of
the fungal cell wall, were elevated in the BAL fluids of patients with
acute eosinopilic pneumonia and that the same decreased with clinical
improvement. Thus, inhalation of fungal glucans (made airborne by desert
winds and other military maneuvers in the theater) may have been the
precipitating factor, rather than new-onset smoking, a link which the
authors seem to favor.

[ProMED thanks Dr. Simhon for his comments. The paper he is referring to
is Kawayama T, Fujiki R, Honda J, et al: High concentration of
(1-->3)-beta-D-glucan in BAL fluid in patients with acute eosinophilic
pneumonia. Chest 2003; 123:1302-7. The abstract of the paper is:
"Our aim in the study was to investigate the pathogenesis of eosinophilic
inflammation in patients with acute eosinophilic pneumonia (AEP), and to
determine the levels of (1-->3)-beta-D-glucan, which is one of the major
components of the cell wall of most fungi, in the BAL fluid (BALF) of those
patients with AEP. 6 patients with AEP and 5 patients with chronic
eosinophilic pneumonia (CEP) that was in the acute stage and had been newly
diagnosed, and 9 healthy subjects from the Kurume University School of
Medicine and the Social Institute Tagawa Hospital between 1995 and 2001
were entered into the study. In AEP patients, (1-->3)-beta-D-glucan was
detected in BALF, and these findings were compared with BALF findings in
patients with CEP as well as with those in healthy subjects. In the BALF of
AEP patients, the mean concentration of (1-->3)-beta-D-glucan was
significantly higher (p less than 0.05) than that of CEP patients as well
as healthy subjects. In patients with AEP, the m!
ean concentration of (1-->3)-beta-D-glucan in BALF was significantly higher
(p less than 0.05) than that in the blood. In 4 of 6 patients with AEP, we
measured serial changes in (1-->3)-beta-D-glucan levels, and the level of
(1-->3)-beta-D-glucan in the BALF decreased with clinical improvement at
follow-up. We concluded that inhaled (1-->3)-beta-D-glucan may be involved
in the mechanisms of pulmonary inflammation in patients with AEP. - Mod.LL]
