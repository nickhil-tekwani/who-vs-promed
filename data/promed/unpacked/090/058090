Indonesia: Suspected 7th Avian Influenza Fatality
-------------------------------------------------
A 23-year-old man has become Indonesia's 7th avian influenza victim,
dying in the hospital last week [final week September 2005] after
being confirmed as suffering from the disease, a doctor said on
Wednesday [5 Oct 2005].
"He died on Thursday [29 Sep 2005], one day after he was admitted
here," said Ilham Patu, a spokesman on avian influenza cases at the
Sulianti Saroso hospital for infectious diseases in the capital. The
young man, who was referred to Sulianti Saroso from a private
hospital in Cibinong south of here, registered positive for the avian
influenza virus in both clinical and blood tests shortly after being
admitted, Patu said. The patient had been in direct contact with
birds and poultry, as he bred birds, and many of his neighbors raised
chickens, the doctor said.
Ilham also said that 2 tests made on an elderly man suspected of
having contracted avian influenza, who died at the same hospital on
Sunday [2 Oct 2005], had produced negative results. Indonesia
currently has more than 60 cases of confirmed or suspected bird flu
in humans, raising new fears of a possible pandemic.
Ilham said tissue and blood samples from the latest [suspected 7th]
victim have been sent to Hong Kong for further confirmatory tests at
a World Health Organization (WHO) laboratory. The H5N1 strain of
avian influenza has also killed 43 people in Viet Nam, 12 in Thailand
and 4 in Cambodia. Only 3 of the Indonesian victims reported by
[Indonesian] authorities here have been confirmed as bird flu deaths
by the WHO lab, with results for the other 3 still pending.
The WHO fears H5N1 will mutate, acquiring genes from the human
influenza virus that would make it highly infectious and lethal to
millions in a global pandemic. But it has also urged calm, saying
investigations in Indonesia had produced no evidence that H5N1 was
spreading easily from person to person. Indonesia has declared it is
facing an "extraordinary" outbreak of the virus, allowing it to order
suspected cases into the hospital, among other measures.
