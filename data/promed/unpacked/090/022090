A _Clostridium perfringens_ outbreak traced to temperature-abused beef stew, Norway, 2012
-----------------------------------
[Authors: E Wahl, S Romma, PE Granum]

On the evening of 21 Jan 2012, the Norwegian Food Safety Authority, district office of Trondheim and Orkdal, was alerted to an outbreak of gastrointestinal disease among participants from several swimming clubs attending a swimming competition in Trondheim. Initial information was passed on in a private conversation between a swimming coach and an employee of the Food Safety Authority, who happened to be present at the swimming competition. Symptoms had started early that day. In response, the Food Safety Authority conducted a few enquires the same evening, which showed that the sick swimmers had stayed at the same hotel and that dinner at this hotel the previous evening (20 Jan 2012) was the only known meal common to all the swimming teams, clearly indicating a probable foodborne outbreak associated with this meal. The Food Safety Authority launched an investigation, according to standard procedures, aimed at preventing possible continuation of the outbreak, describing the outbreak, identifying the source and causal agent, and if possible advise on preventive measures.

Initial information allowed further investigations to focus on factors specifically associated with the suspected hotel dinner. We describe here the investigation and results of what turned out to be among the largest _Clostridium perfringens_ outbreaks reported in Norway, adding to the current evidence base of _C. perfringens_ outbreaks.

Outbreak population data
------------------------
A total of 111 people from 6 swimming clubs from different parts of Norway, including swimmers, coaches, and tour leaders, aged 12-55 years, stayed at the hotel from Fri 20 to Sun 22 Jan 2012, while they attended a swimming competition in Trondheim that weekend. In addition to the swimming team members, approximately 50 other guests stayed at the hotel that weekend. For those other guests, information on food consumption and possible illness was not available, and they were therefore not included in the outbreak investigation. Consequently, the outbreak population was defined as all members of the 6 swimming teams staying at the hotel from 20 to 22 Jan 2012.

Members from all 6 swimming teams had dinner at the hotel on 20 Jan 2012 at approximately 9 p.m., whereas members from only 2 of the swimming teams had lunch at the hotel that day. Except for these meals at the hotel, the members from the 6 teams had no other known common meal or other common contacts, neither during 20 Jan 2012, nor during the preceding month.

Case definition
---------------
An outbreak case was defined as a member of a swimming team staying at the hotel from 20 to 22 Jan 2012, who fell ill with diarrhea, abdominal pain, or nausea during this period.

Kitchen inspections and guidance
--------------------------------
Food control officers inspected the hotel kitchen several times. On 23 Jan 2012, the number and group affiliations of guests and list of hotel meals eaten were collected, and food control officers observed the basic hygiene status of the kitchen. Kitchen staff were asked to describe all dishes served at the dinner on 20 Jan 2012 and all relevant procedures for preparing and handling of foods served at this meal. The investigation specifically addressed factors associated with the growth of spore-forming pathogens in foods: _C. perfringens_ and _Bacillus cereus_ -- such as time and temperature aspects of chilling and reheating, and temperature during serving -- because preliminary descriptions of the symptoms and outbreak setting provided reasons to suspect one of these pathogens as the causative agent. On this inspection, available food leftovers from the dinner -- beef stew and boiled rice -- were sampled. During a 2nd inspection of the kitchen on 26 Jan 2012, more detailed data on food handling were collected, and the kitchen was swabbed. On meeting with the kitchen manager on 31 Jan 2012, preliminary microbial results were presented and control officers gave guidance on hygiene, food safety, and preventive measures.

Background
----------
_C. perfringens_ is a spore-forming bacterium widely distributed throughout the environment, which may cause foodborne disease (1). _C. perfringens_ enterotoxin (CPE) encoded by the cpe gene is the major virulence factor, causing tissue damage of intestinal epithelial cells in an infected person and leading to self-limiting diarrhea and abdominal pain as main symptoms. The incubation period is 6-24 hours (usually 10-12 hours) (2). The duration of illness is mostly reported to be a maximum of 24 hours. Longer duration has been reported from at least one outbreak (mean: 2.3 days; range: 1-10)(3). The infective dose is estimated to be 6 to 7 logs of cells (1,4).

Vegetative cells of _C. perfringens_ grow between 15 and 50 deg C [59-122 deg F], with optimal growth around 43-45 deg C [109.4-113 deg F] (1). The generation time may be as low as 7-8 minutes under optimal growth conditions (5). _C. perfringens_ spores in food will survive boiling. If food handling includes long time intervals at temperatures permitting rapid growth, the content of _C. perfringens_ may rise to a level that causes risk of foodborne infection.

The majority of environmental _C. perfringens_ strains are cpe-negative (6). Cpe-positive _C. perfringens_ strains are shown to produce spores with a higher heat resistance (1) and will therefore be selected for in kitchen environments. For these reasons, foodborne outbreaks due to _C. perfringens_ are most often associated with foods subjected to poor temperature control, produced in commercial kitchens (1,7), as demonstrated by reported outbreaks (8,9). Direct or indirect person-to-person faecal-oral transmission is not considered to be an important transmission route (1,2).

_C. perfringens_ is traditionally considered to be a frequent cause of foodborne infection in Norway (4) and other industrialized countries (1), but as the symptoms are usually mild, outbreaks are often not reported. Among 242 foodborne outbreaks with a recognized causal microbial agent reported in Norway during 2005 to 2011, 8 outbreaks (3 percent) were caused by _C. perfringens_, of which the largest included 45 cases (personal communication, B Heier, Norwegian Institute of Public Health, 4 May 2012).

Results
------
Details of hotel dinner and food storage:
The hotel dinner on 20 Jan 2012 was served from 6 pm to 9:30 pm as a buffet with 6 cold dishes (cheese, ham, cured meat sausage, liver paste ('leverpostei'), green salad, and bread) and 2 hot dishes (beef stew and rice). The rice had been boiled immediately before the meal, whereas the beef stew had been prepared the day before, cooled to room temperature, and placed in a refrigerated room at 4 deg C [39.2 deg F] overnight and reheated before serving. During cooking, chilling, storage, reheating, and service, the stew was kept in trays containing approximately 15 L. The duration of storage and temperature of the food during cooling, reheating, and serving of the stew had not been recorded. The kitchen had no clear procedures for control of these aspects of food handling, and could not provide data on relevant temperature tests to validate general procedures.

Microbial analysis:
From the beef stew, 3.8 x log 8 colony-forming units (CFU) of _C. perfringens_ per gram of food were found; _B. cereus_ was not detected. Further investigation of cultures from 4 selected _C. perfringens_ colonies isolated from beef stew showed the presence of cpe in all these cultures. Neither _B. cereus_ nor _C. perfringens_ was detected in the rice.

Among 20 swab samples taken from different parts of the kitchen, cpe-negative _C. perfringens_ was detected in one culture from the floor; the remaining 19 samples were negative. Cpe-positive _C. perfringens_ was not detected in any of the samples from the kitchen environment.

From 4 cpe-positive _C. perfringens_ cultures isolated from the stew, SDS PAGE [sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis] analysis showed an indistinguishable protein profile among these cultures, whereas the profile of the single cpe-negative _C. perfringens_ culture isolated from the sample from the kitchen floor showed several protein bands not present in the profile from the cultures isolated from the stew.

Descriptive epidemiological results:
Of the outbreak population comprising 111 individuals, 61 (55 percent) responded and returned the questionnaires. The median age of the respondents was 16 years (range: 12-55). A total of 43 respondents met the case definition, giving an attack rate of 70 percent (43/61) among the respondents.

The median age of the cases was 16 years (range: 12-47). The median incubation period (counting from the start of the dinner on 20 Jan 2012, at 9 pm) was 10 hours (range: 3-28 hours). The most frequent symptoms were diarrhea and abdominal pain: both were reported from 39 of the 43 cases, followed by nausea (n=31), headache (n=15) and vomiting n=5). The median duration of symptoms was 35 hours (range: 8-96). No cases reported having consulted a physician. A total of 10 cases reported to have withdrawn from scheduled participation in swimming events because of the illness, and 10 other cases reported having participated in all the swimming events as scheduled, but with lower performance than expected, due to the illness.

Cohort analysis:
Cohort analysis of the 61 respondents showed that both hot dishes served at the hotel dinner on 20 Jan 2012 -- beef stew (relative risk (RR): 12.51; 95 percent CI: 1.89-82.91) and rice (RR: 5.02; 95 percent CI: 1.41-17.90) were significantly associated with illness. One case did not eat beef stew and 2 cases did not eat rice. Among 47 persons who ate the stew, all but one also ate rice. For all 6 cold dishes served at the dinner, the RR was less than 1 (Table [for table, see original source URL above. - Mod.LL]).

Food safety and public health action:
In accordance with legislation and normal procedures of the Norwegian Food Safety Authority, the hotel kitchen management was advised to implement routines to prevent similar incidents, including procedures for control of time and temperature during food handling, cleaning procedures, and to ensure that these routines were understood and followed by all staff.

Discussion
----------
This outbreak of 43 cases of gastrointestinal disease, occurring within a period of 25 hours among the swimming team members at the hotel, strongly suggested a common source and possible foodborne outbreak. The setting -- a communal meal prepared in a commercial kitchen [1] -- clinical symptoms, and incubation period [2] were typical of _C. perfringens_ infection. _C. perfringens_ in high numbers, exceeding the assumed infection dose, was isolated from beef stew eaten by all cases but one. The presence of cpe and indistinguishable protein profiles among all 4 of the isolated _C. perfringens_ cultures that were tested indicated that the microbial flora of the stew was dominated by a single cpe-positive _C. perfringens_ strain. These findings together strongly indicated _C. perfringens_ as the causative agent. Conditions in which the leftovers were stored after the dinner and before sampling (3 days after consumption) would have allowed further growth of _C. perfringens_. Therefore, the concentration and heterogeneity of _C. perfringens_ in the stew at the time of consumption is unknown, but considering the short generation time under optimal conditions, the concentration probably increased substantially during preparation and handling before consumption.

Since none of the cases visited a physician, no stool samples were taken. Detection of _C. perfringens_ in stool samples from one or more cases might have supported the identification of the causative agent.

The univariate cohort analysis demonstrated significant association between disease and eating beef stew. The only exposure other than consumption of stew showing a RR greater than 1 was consumption of rice. Preparation and handling of the stew before serving was not satisfactory, providing conditions (time and temperature) that permitted rapid growth of _C. perfringens_, whereas for the rice, this was not the case. Reheating before serving would not have killed the bacterial spores. The pathogenic bacteria were found in high concentrations in the stew but not in the rice. These findings strongly suggest that the beef stew was the source of the pathogens. A RR greater than 1 for the rice in the univariate analysis can be explained as a confounding effect, attributed to the fact that all persons but one who ate the stew also ate the rice, and is therefore compatible with a hypothesis of the stew as source of the pathogens. Had a multivariate analysis been performed, confounding effects might have been better clarified. Due to lack of resources, however, this was not performed.

The case definition was chosen not to include vomiting. Only 5 of those who were ill reported vomiting, which is consistent with reports of other authors, thus we regard this as a variable rare symptom of _C. perfringens_ infection (1). Inclusion of vomiting in the case definition would not have altered the epidemiological results and conclusions substantially.

The symptoms experienced by the cases were mild (mainly diarrhea, abdominal pain and nausea) and the median incubation period was 10 hours. These clinical observations correspond well with the typical characteristics of _C. perfringens_ infection (2). The median duration of symptoms (35 hours; range 8-96), however, deviates from the typical duration of symptoms for _C. perfringens_ infection -- generally assumed to be less than 24 hours (1,2). Duration of symptoms exceeding 24 hours has been described in another outbreak of _C. perfringens_ infection, in which the median duration was reported be to 2 days (3). Elderly or immunosuppressed persons may experience longer duration of symptoms (1,3). Among the cases in the outbreak described here, there was, however, no indication of immunosuppression -- on the contrary, most cases were young athletes, assumed to be in good health condition. We cannot envisage other specific factors that could explain the unusually long duration of symptoms among the cases in this outbreak. The clinical data in our study were self reported, subject to individual judgment and possible recall bias, and should therefore be considered with caution. We consider it however unlikely, that the long duration of symptoms observed in our study can be attributed exclusively to bias. Thus our findings and the report from Eriksen et al (3) suggest that the normal range for duration of symptoms for _C. perfringens_ infection among the general population should be considered to exceed 24 hours, possibly up to 2 or 3 days.

In conclusion, the outbreak described is one of the largest _C. perfringens_ outbreaks reported in Norway. Although the incubation period and symptoms were typical for _C. perfringens_ infection, the duration of the symptoms was markedly longer in this outbreak compared with that described in most reports, suggesting that the range for duration of symptoms for _C. perfringens_ infection should be reconsidered.
