The Bolivia Ministry of Health reported this week that 13 military personnel were infected with [a] hantavirus in the military camps of the Joint Task Force of the Yungas, including one death and 2 cases requiring intensive care.

This has prompted health officials to send a team to the region. "In the 3 points of Inca Huara, Siguana Chico and Puerto Aroma of the municipality of La Asunta [La Paz department], 15 doctors, laboratory personnel, biologists, technical personnel, experts in zoonoses, rodents handling will take samples and verify of specimens of captured rodents," officials said.

National Chief of Epidemiology, Vicente Gonzalez Aramayo also noted that experts will perform analyzes of environments, food, water, among others.

"The medical staff will focus on the clinical review or 'triage' of the personnel who were exposed to the virus and have some relationship with the 1st positive case, in order to determine the possible source of infection," he added.

"We have declared quarantine in 3 Departments of Joint Task Force, therefore we have suspended the eradication work until the Ministry of Health guarantees the adequate conditions to continue with the work," he said.

At the national level there are 34 cases of hantavirus [infections this year (2018)]: 2 were reported in the department of Cochabamba, 10 cases in Santa Cruz, 9 in Tarija, and 13 cases in the Yungas region of the department of La Paz.

[The previous ProMED post of this cluster of cases reported 9 affected soldiers (see Hantavirus - Americas (53): Bolivia (LP) 20181011.6085684). That total is now 13, including 2 in intensive care and one death. Hantavirus infections have occurred previously in various parts of Bolivia, including in tropical areas of La Paz department. Occurrence of scattered hantavirus infections in soldiers in military camps in Bolivia is not surprising although a cluster of cases occurring in 3 different areas at the same time is unusual. As noted in the previous comments, earlier cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome have been reported from tropical, lowland areas of Bolivia. The specific hantaviruses involved in these or previous cases for the last several years in Bolivia are not reported.

In the lowland Amazon Basin of Bolivia, the possible hantavirus, its rodent hosts that might be involved in these hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) cases, with their images, include:

- Laguna Negra virus: small vesper mouse _Calomys laucha_ http://www.faunaparaguay.com/calomyslaucha.html and large vesper mouse _C. callosus_ http://www.faunaparaguay.com/Calomys%20callosus%20www.pybio.org%201.jpg;
- Bermejo virus: Chaco rice rat _O. chacoensis_ http://www.faunaparaguay.com/oligorizomyschacoensis.html;
- Oran virus: long-tailed pygmy rice rat _O. longicaudatus_ http://calphotos.berkeley.edu/imgs/512x768/0000_0000/0711/1203.jpeg.

Dr Jan Clement earlier pointed out the need to be able to differentiate Seoul hantavirus, with its wide distribution around the world, from hantaviruses found in the Americas. - Mod.TY
