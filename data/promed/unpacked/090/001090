Even as the Philippines Department of Health saw great success with their mass measles and polio vaccination campaign, "Ligtas sa Tigdas," in which, as of 30 Sep 2014, the country's national coverage status reached 84 per cent (or 99.6 million people), the latest data from the World Health Organization (WHO) saw the number of cases increase by another 10 000 in September 2014. The Philippines has now seen 94 539 cases of the viral disease, up from 84 738 cases one month earlier.

During the same period in 2013, the Philippines saw 5763 confirmed cases. The WHO Measles-Rubella Bulletin for September 2014 says the country has seen 97 deaths due to measles. Only China has reported more measles cases (144 692) this year [2014], according to the WHO. The data from India have not been listed.

The disease is also called rubeola. Measles virus normally grows in the cells that line the back of the throat and lungs. Measles spreads through the air by breathing, coughing or sneezing. It is so contagious that any child who is exposed to it and is not immune will probably get the disease. Symptoms of measles include fever, runny nose, cough and a rash all over the body. About one out of 10 children with measles also gets an ear infection, and up to one out of 20 gets pneumonia. About one out of 1000 gets encephalitis, and one or 2 out of 1000 die.

The increasing number of measles cases in the country is among the reasons for the mass immunisation [programme] being conducted by the Department of Health [DOH] nationwide. During the Kapihan sa Baguio [festival] media forum on Thursday [16 Oct 2014], DOH-Cordillera Administrative Region assistant regional director Amelita Pangilinan said that there have been 117 confirmed cases of measles from January to October this year [2014], compared to 60 cases for the same period last year [2013], with a reported death from Baguio City. This represents a 95 per cent increase of measles cases in the region during 2014.

The province of Benguet recorded the highest number of cases with 59, followed by Baguio with 34, Kalinga with 14, Ifugao with 4, Abra with 3, Mountain Province with 2, and Apayao with one confirmed case. Pangilinan said that the increasing number of cases of measles is the reason the DOH has a long term plan for national immunization with the measles/rubella (MR vaccine) and oral polio (OPV) vaccination, which was extended until 10 Oct 2014.

"The MR immunization is for children 9 months to 59 months old, while the OPV is for 0 to 59 months, regardless of whether the child has already been vaccinated or not," said Pangilinan. She explained that their target is 95 per cent because the assumption is that if 95 per cent are immunized, this will protect the whole community; the 5 per cent will be overruled, which is the principle of immunization.

The DOH-CAR in the Ligtas sa Tigdas national campaign for the whole month of September 2014, which had been extended until 10 Oct 2014, has recorded 172 123 children vaccinated with MR (measles and rubella) vaccine and 234 002 given OPV (oral polio vaccine) as of 8 Oct 2014. The data represent 86.35 per cent of the estimated eligible population targeted for MR vaccination and 83.84 per cent for the OPV vaccination.

Pangilinan cited some detrimental factors that hampered vaccination of children, which include religious beliefs and inaccurate information held by parents concerning vaccination and its possibly detrimental effects.

[Baguio City is a highly urbanized locality in the province of Benguet in northern Luzon island of the Philippines. The city has become the center of business and commerce as well as the center of education in the entire Northern Luzon region, becoming the seat of government of the Cordillera Administrative Region (CAR). The city is at an altitude of about 1540 metres in the Luzon tropical pine forest eco-region, conducive for the growth of mossy plants and orchids. Because of its cool climate, Baguio City was designated by the Philippine Commission as the "Summer Capital" of the Philippines, wherein the government was transferred to the city to escape the lowland heat during summer.

The exceptional prevalence of measles in the Philippines and its prevalence elsewhere in the Pacific region has currently been eclipsed by the catastrophic outbreaks of Ebola and Marburg disease in Western Africa. - Mod.CP
