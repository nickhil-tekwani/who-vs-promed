[From the previous ProMED-mail post--Although carbon dioxide levels may
accumulate and be the cause of death, sulfur is what smells of rotten
eggs. - Mod.TG
More precisely, sulfur dioxide is the smell of rotten eggs, and it is
common to volcanic emissions. It is toxic, with an IDLH [Immediately
Dangerous to Life and Health concentration of 100 parts per million
(ppm); its odor is noticeable at 3-5 ppm, but the sense of smell is
desensitized at higher levels.
It is worth noting that the "Killer Lake of Cameroon" (Lake Nyos, in
Zimbabwe) killed at least 1746 people and thousands of cattle up to 20 km
distant in 1986 when it released a large volume of carbon dioxide gas.
Due to the depth of the lake (about 610'), large concentrations of carbon
dioxide gas dissolve in the depths. Vertical stratification in conjunction
with an absence of turnover found in temperate regions thanks to seasonal
changes permits the accumulation of large quantities of carbon dioxide gas.
When the layers are disturbed (landslide, etc.), the gas can erupt like an
uncorked champagne bottle. Local topography channeled the dense gas,
asphyxiating people while they slept.
Lake Nyos and Lake Monoun have been shown to accumulate dissolved carbon
dioxide thanks to a volcanic source, and efforts are underway to release
the gas in a controlled manner to prevent future incidents.
Unfortunately, funding is scant, and the research is not only
experimental but potentially dangerous.

This sounds very strange. Are you sure it's CO2 that's the culprit?
Increased FiCO2 will trigger an intense hyperventilation response which
would drive the bather out of the spring to seek more air (that is lower
ambient CO2 concentrations). The ventilatory response to CO2 is usually
so strong that it is a test done in some PFT labs.

The smell of sulfur in this report suggests that there may be low levels
of H2S [hydrogen sulfide present. Should the levels occasionally exceed
50 parts per million (ppm), it would explain the deaths. Has anyone
checked that out?
The previous erection of a higher wall around the spring could elevate
the levels of H2S as well as the CO2.

As the moderator noted, the rotten egg smell is associated with sulphur -
most likely as hydrogen sulfide gas which is extremely poisonous. In
Rotorua, New Zealand, there have been a number of deaths associated with
hydrogen sulphide gas from thermal activity. Surely hydrogen sulfide
trapped by the brick wall is the more likely culprit in the Northern
Californian deaths?

[As has been mentioned, the aspect of carbon dioxide is suspiciously
incorrect. Also, the smell of sulfur, or that of rotten eggs, would indeed
indicate the presence of hydrogen sulfide. I hope we will be getting more
definitive information from California. Until such is forthcoming, this
thread is cut. - Mod.TG
