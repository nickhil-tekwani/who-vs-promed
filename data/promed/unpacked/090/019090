Detectives are holding 2 suspects in relation to the alleged processing and issuance of fake COVID-19 and Yellow Fever vaccination certificates.

The suspects were arrested on Wednesday [7 Dec 2022] in Malaba town after their illegal operations were leaked to the police.

Officers from the Directorate of Criminal Investigations from Teso North are holding the suspects at the Malaba police station pending the completion of investigations.

The officers said they will remain in custody until Wednesday next week [14 Dec 2022] when they will be arraigned at the Busia Law Courts.

"We are investigating the matter and we requested the court to give us 7 days to conclude investigations. Wednesday next week [14 Dec 2022], the suspects will return to court," a DCI officer who sought anonymity told the Star on phone.

"I will not want to go on record over this case because my senior who is authorised to comment is away on official leave," he said.

Busia County Health Director Dr Melisa Lutomia declined to comment on the issue when contacted saying it is still a matter under investigation.

"Let us allow investigations to end first," she told the Star on Saturday [10 Dec 2022] on the phone.

"On the same note, this is a national government issue which is not under my mandate."

The mandate of processing and issuing COVID-19 and Yellow Fever certificates to travellers at the border rests with the Port Health Services.

Travellers who have applied for the certificates are, however, free to download and print the documents at cybercaf√©s.

Following the arrest, investigators want to find out if there are other people, besides the 2, who are involved in the syndicate.

They also want to know the extent the business has penetrated border operations, a development that may have denied the government crucial information regarding travellers that went through the Malaba border.

The DCI officers also want to establish why the 2 were not prosecuted despite them having been previously arrested on forgery accounts.

The suspects were reportedly previously arrested over the same accusations at the Malaba One Stop Border Post.

At the time of their arrest, the 2 suspects were found with COVID-19 certificates.

Detectives told the media that details of the confiscated certificates will be made public after investigations are completed.

Teso North subcounty police commander David Muange called on members of the public to allow DCI officers to complete investigations.

Muange confirmed that the 2 suspects are being held at Malaba police station.

On 27 Aug 2020, 2 suspects were arrested in Busia town after they were accused of issuing fake COVID-19 clearance certificates in Busia county.

The duo were nabbed by DCI sleuths following concerns from the public.

DCI officers said then that several fake certificates had been confiscated from the suspects.

Additional items that include a computer and a scanner believed to have been used in running the fake COVID-19 testing centre were also recovered.

Malaba is a busy border transit town where approximately 20 000 people cross to and from Uganda every day.

[The individuals who have been arrested for selling fake yellow fever (YF) vaccination and COVID-19 clearance certificates are suspects, but not yet convicted. Issuance of fake YF certificates has been a sporadic problem in several African countries that are endemic for the virus. This report is the 1st incidence of issuance of fake COVID-19 certificates that ProMED has received. The sale of fake yellow fever vaccination cards to individuals who did not receive the vaccine presents a serious public health problem inside and outside of Kenya. Neighboring Uganda has had an outbreak of sylvan-origin YF in 2016. Although it was declared ended on 6 Sep 2016, the risk of new cases from forest sources remains. An unvaccinated, viremic individual with a fake card who becomes infected outside Kenya could carry YF virus to localities in the country where vector mosquitoes are present and initiate an outbreak of this serious disease. An unvaccinated individual who becomes infected in Kenya and travels to an area abroad where there are vectors could initiate a new outbreak.

One wonders, if the practice of issuance of fake YF cards continues, whether countries that are currently YF-free but are most at risk of ongoing transmission should the virus be introduced, in Central and North America, South and South East Asia, may deny visas to or admittance of individuals coming from Kenya unless they can prove that their cards are legitimate. The Kenya government authorities should put a stop to these practices immediately.

The epidemiological consequences of issuance of fake COVID-19 certificates is not certain. As of 7 Dec 2022, Kenya has reported 342 093 cases with 5684 deaths. Currently, there are 515 active cases (see https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/#countries). The percent of the population that has been vaccinated was not reported. Issuance of fake COVID-19 clearance certificates to individuals who have not been vaccinated or not been tested negative poses a risk that infected individuals can transport the virus to other countries, as in the case of YF. - Mod.TY
