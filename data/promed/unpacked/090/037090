The St Joseph County Health Department is investigating whether a South Bend man's death is related to shrimp recently recalled from Martin's Super Markets. This may be an issue concerning food preparation, not foodborne illness, according to the St Joseph County Health Department.

On 17 Feb 2012, Memorial Hospital alerted the county health department it had a patient with _Vibrio fluvialis_ bacteria in his system. The health department then interviewed that man's wife to see what he may have eaten to give him that bacterium.

Many vibrios including _V. fluvialis_ can be found naturally in many uncooked seafood, including shrimp. The Food and Drug Administration told WSBT on Tuesday [6 Mar 2012] that if the food is cooked properly the bacterium usually doesn't make people sick.

The health department found out the man had consumed Harvest of the Sea brand Quick and Fit Raw, Tail On, Peeled and Cleaned 21 to 25 count, 16-ounce frozen shrimp. The health department tested a 2nd bag of this shrimp that was in that man's freezer and determined it also carried the bacterium.

Dr Thomas Felger, the county health officer, said that bag of shrimp came from the Martin's Supermarket on Ireland Road. He also said the man who died was battling another type of illness that weakened his immune system and made him more susceptible to the bacterium.

Felger said he doesn't know of any other cases related to bacterium found in the frozen shrimp. He called this a "rare and isolated incident" and added that cooking seafood to the right temperature will almost always eliminate any contamination that could make you sick.

A spokesman from Harvest of the Sea told us they sell the shrimp only to Martin's stores. No other stores in the country would carry that brand of shrimp, said Steven Fink, President of Lexicon Communications Corp, speaking on behalf of Harvest of the Sea. "We don't know if there was any correlation at all between the illness/death and the product. If there is any correlation at all, obviously we will take whatever steps necessary. But no one, including our scientists, has presented any evidence to connect those dots," Fink said.

New developments Wednesday [7 Mar 2012], concerning a local recall WSBT has been following involving Martin's Super Markets. The FDA has informed Martin's that a certain brand of frozen shrimp IS safe to eat.

As WSBT first reported, Martin's Super Markets voluntarily pulled the Harvest of the Sea brand Quick and Fit Raw, Tail On, Peeled and Cleaned 21 to 25 count, 16 ounce frozen shrimp from its shelves last month [February 2012] after a man tested positive for a certain type of bacterium after eating the shrimp. That man died a week later. The St Joseph County health officer told WSBT the man was battling another type of illness and had a weakened immune system.

The FDA told WSBT if the food is cooked properly, the bacteria usually don't make people sick. On Wed 7 Mar 2012, a Martin's spokesperson added that with any raw product, proper handling, and preparation is always recommended.

[Given the lack of adequate clinical data, it is not clear if any attributable mortality could be given to the _V. fluvialis_ infection that was based on finding the same organism upon culturing the frozen, uncooked shrimp that was isolated from the patient.

The statement attributed to the FDA that "if the food is cooked properly, the bacteria usually don't make people sick" is used to affirm that the "smoking" shrimp are safe to eat. Would the same statement be made if the isolate was one of the many other well-recognized heat-labile foodborne pathogens? Certainly, tons and tons and tons of ground beef have been recalled because of contamination with _E. coli_ O157 which "if the food is cooked properly, the bacteria usually don't make people sick." The difference likely comes from the observation that vibrios are not contaminants to the vehicle in the sense that the organisms are normal flora in the sea water and not related to animal or human fecal (or otherwise) contamination. The Indiana man in this posting likely acquired _V. fluvialis_ infection, either eating the shrimp uncooked or (and more likely) eating cooked shrimp that became contaminated by poor kitchen hygiene.

_V. fluvialis_, formerly designated as a group F vibrio or CDC group EF-6, can be isolated seasonally from sea water not infrequently in tropical and subtropical areas. _Fluvialis_ is from the Latin for river, reflecting the early isolation of the organism from river and estuarine waters. Like the non-cholera vibrios, the organism is not necessarily representative of fecal contamination but rather can be considered "normal flora".

It has been reported to have caused more than 500 cases of diarrhea in Bangladesh over a 9 month period in 1976-1977 (1). An early report form the USA (2) also linked the organism to diarrhea, particularly watery diarrhea without fever in coastal areas. A series of 10 cases from Florida has been reported, all with diarrheal illness (3). 8 of the 10 had eaten seafood within a week of illness, 5 with raw oysters, 2 with shrimp, and 1 with cooked fish. The non-oyster cases may have been related to poor kitchen hygiene. Additionally, a small foodborne outbreak involving 14 of 34 people was reported from India (4) where 9 of the 14 had the organism isolated from a diarrheal sample.

Besides diarrhea, which can be severe, cholera-like in intensity, and can be linked to bacteremia and fatalities, the organism has been reported to cause a variety of other infections including hemorrhagic cellulitis and cerebritis, peritonitis with or without peritoneal dialysis as a risk factor, appendicitis, and biliary tract disease.

Of interest, a bacterium quite similar to _V. fluvialis_ has been implicated as the cause of limp lobster disease (5), which was recognized in 1997-98 in _Homarus americanus_ lobsters from Maine, USA coastal waters. Although similar, this organism was cryophilic (also referred to as psychrophilic, not growing at temperatures above 23 deg C (73 deg F).

The reader is referred to reference 6 for a longer discussion of _V. fluvialis_.
