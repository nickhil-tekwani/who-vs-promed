On 13 Mar 2001 at 10.30 P.M. the Italian National Reference Centre for
Vesicular Diseases (CERVES) of the IZS of Brescia received from the IZS of
Teramo the samples taken in the suspected outbreak of FMD recorded in
Pianella, Pescara Province, Central Italy.
The samples consisted of 6 tongues (complete with pharynx) and 60 blood
samples of sheep.
All the samples were immediately treated and examined using serological and
virological tests for FMD. The same materials were contemporarily examined
by using negative staining EM in order to verify the presence of other
viral agents that can cause diseases characterized by symptoms and lesions
similar to FMD.
The following tests, which are specific for the virological diagnosis of
FMD, all gave negative results:
- Identification of the viral agent by ELISA using monoclonal antibodies
- Identification of the viral agent by ELISA using polyclonal antibodies
- PCR genomic amplification
The only test that remains is the attempt to isolate FMDV on IB-RS2 e BHK21
cell lines. The result of this test will be available within 48 hrs.
The serological tests, completed on 14 Mar 2001 in the afternoon, did not
reveal in any of the 60 sera the presence of antibodies against the
structural or nonstructural FMDV proteins.
The electron microscopy observation of the tongue's epithelial homogenates
by negative staining revealed several viral particles morphologically
resembling orf virus, i.e. the parapoxvirus agent of contagious ecthyma.
This is a self-limiting disease causing low levels of mortality in sheep
and is characterized by some clinical signs and lesions similar to those
induced by FMDV.
On the whole, the laboratory results obtained suggest a final diagnosis of
contagious ecthyma.
