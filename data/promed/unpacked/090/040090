Salvadoran health authorities placed hospitals on "red alert" at the
rising number of cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever [DHF], which
has already killed 4 people.
Salvadoran Deputy Health Minister Herberth Betancourt told the
media that the local health system had been placed on "red alert,"
due to the detection of 32 cases of DHF, [transmitted by] _Aedes
aegypti_ mosquitoes.
Since plasma supplies at the Red Cross and in hospitals were
limited, the Health Ministry called on the people to donate blood.
In addition, Betancourt said that a new type of dengue had
appeared in the country, known as "virus two," [i.e., dengue 2 virus],
which has already been detected in Honduras and Nicaragua.
