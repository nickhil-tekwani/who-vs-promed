Because of the recent occurrence of a varicella [chickenpox] outbreak affecting the inmates of the Villavicencio [Meta] jailhouse, the Municipal Health Secretariat and the National Penitentiary Institute (Inpec, according to its Spanish initials) established restrictions for visits to the Colombia and Santander buildings in the aforementioned jailhouse.

Mr Ferney Sandoval-Rodriguez, Public Health Director of the Municipal Public Health Secretariat, confirmed that children less than 5 years old, pregnant women, adults older than 60 years, and immunosuppressed subjects (those diagnosed with lupus, tuberculosis, or HIV infection, until 21 days after the occurrence of the last varicella case) are not allowed to enter the jailhouse.

He added that this measure was taken aiming to prevent the disease (varicella) from 'getting out' of the jailhouse and becoming a public health problem, since it is easily transmitted and it may lead to severe consequences in the health of the family of affected persons.

Mr Sandoval-Rodriguez pointed out that if varicella should affect pregnant women, it may lead to high temperature, which (also) may lead to fetal malformations, mental retardation, or microcephaly in newborns.

For his part, Dr Carlos Alberto Ramos, epidemiologist from the Municipal Health Secretariat, assured that the situation in the jailhouse is under control, that the 20 affected inmates are being taken care of properly, and that they are receiving the medications they need for treating their disease.

He also explained that the varicella outbreak will be over according to the convalescence time for this disease, which is 21 days, and when this period is over, the visit restriction in the Meta capital city jailhouse will be lifted.

The restriction was established on the basis of the 9th bill from 1979 and decree no. 3518, and also taking into account all regulations for surveillance and interest control in public health that are in vigor for all prisons in Colombia.

[Not only are visitors and other inmates at risk, but also non-immune prison staff are susceptible to varicella and may transmit infection in prison environments, where higher than average risk is due to the closeness of the population. In most situations, a definite history of chickenpox or vaccination is usually sufficient evidence that an individual is immune, with history of chickenpox having a positive predictive value of 90 percent.

Individuals who have been exposed to infectious cases can be offered varicella zoster immunoglobulin (VZIG) prophylaxis. People who are seriously at risk include pregnant women, neonates, immunocompromised individuals. VZIG contains protective antibodies against chickenpox that are taken from the blood of healthy people who have high levels of protection against varicella virus. However, VZIG rarely is given unless a person at risk of serious complications has been exposed to someone with chickenpox for more than one hour. Doctors can use the antiviral medication acyclovir (Zovirax) to help minimize the symptoms of chickenpox in adults, but it is only effective if it is started within the 1st 24 hours after exposure.
