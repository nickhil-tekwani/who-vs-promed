[According to Morocco's official information to the OIE, PPR was recorded there for the 1st time between June 2008 and January 2009. Hundreds of outbreaks were reported. Mass vaccination (with a live-attenuated PPR vaccine) was subsequently applied. The 2nd event started in July 2015 and continued until September 2015.

Vaccination has been named as Morocco's official control measure each year since 2009.

PPR, as one of the most damaging of all animal diseases, is among the priority diseases indicated in the FAO-OIE Global Framework for the Progressive Control of Transboundary Animal Diseases (GF-TADs) 5 Year Action Plan. In response to recommendations of GF-TADs, a resolution by the World Assembly of Delegates of the OIE (May 2014) and recommendations of the Committee on Agriculture (COAG) and the Council of FAO, the GF-TADs Working group has developed the PPR Global Control and Eradication Strategy, which has been presented at the FAO and OIE International Conference for the Control and Eradication of peste des petits ruminants held in Abidjan (Cote d'Ivoire), 31 Mar - 2 Apr 2015.

FAO-OIE most recent global conference on Peste des Petits Ruminants was held in Brussels 6-7 Sep 2018. For OIE's PPR portal, please go to https://www.oie.int/en/animal-health-in-the-world/ppr-portal/.
