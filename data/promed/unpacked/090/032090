A part-time Hong Kong butcher has become the 3rd victim of the
pig-borne _Streptococcus suis_ in the territory in less than a month,
the South China Morning Post reported on Saturday [26 May 2007].
The article said the 54-year-old man developed fever, headache and
neck pain nearly 2 weeks ago, but was admitted to hospital only on
Tuesday [22 May 2007] and was stable yesterday [25 May 2007]. It
added that the victim helped sell pork at several markets.
All 3 cases in the territory were diagnosed within the past 8 days
and are believed to have been contracted locally, the report said.
While the patient had spent a day in the mainland Chinese city of
Shenzhen early this month [May 2007], the trip "may not be related"
to the disease, the paper quoted an unnamed health official as saying.
There have been no reported cases on the Chinese mainland since a
deadly outbreak in 2005, the article said. It added that the
bacterial infection is rarely fatal in humans, but an unusually
virulent strain killed more than 30 people in Sichuan province in 2005.
Eight cases were reported last year [2006] in Hong Kong, with 13 -- 2
of them fatal -- in 2005.
Pork prices have soared in mainland China after an outbreak of blue
ear disease, or Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome (PRRS)
which surfaced a year ago. Experts and industry sources have said it
wiped out as many as a million pigs.
