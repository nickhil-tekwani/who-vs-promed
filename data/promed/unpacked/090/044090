The Indonesian health ministry has reported 2 deaths from bird flu in
recent weeks, easing concerns about whether Jakarta would share
information about the disease, the World Health Organisation (WHO)
said on Thursday [19 Jun 2008]. Indonesia has had more human H5N1
infections than any other country, with 110 deaths out of 135 cases.
[It is unclear whether the 2 deaths announced below are included in
this figure or are additional. - Mod.CP]

The latest infections are the 1st since Health Minister Siti Fadillah
Supari said 2 weeks ago that Jakarta had changed its policy on
reporting human cases and would only announce the death toll every 6
months [see ProMED-mail posting: Avian influenza, human (51):
Indonesia, new policy 20080606.1811. - Mod.CP]. The WHO, a United
Nations agency, has been seeking clarification on her remarks, which
appeared to run counter to international health regulations requiring
the WHO's 193 member states to report human cases of bird flu within
24 hours. "We've had reassurances they are going to comply with the
international health regulations," WHO spokesman in Geneva John
Rainford told Reuters on Thursday [19 Jun 2008].

The WHO, in a statement reporting information from the Indonesian
health ministry, said that a 16-year-old girl from South Jakarta died
on 14 May 2008 and a 34-year-old woman from Banten province died on 3
Jun 2008. Investigation into the girl's death indicate she was
exposed to sick and dead poultry, which carry the H5N1 virus, while
investigations into the source of the 2nd woman's infection are
continuing, according to the WHO statement.

There have been 385 human bird flu infections, including 243
fatalities in 15 countries worldwide since 2003, it says.

Indonesia has maintained its decision not to share bird flu samples
with WHO laboratories, saying it wants guarantees from richer nations
and drug makers that poor countries would get access to affordable
vaccines developed from their samples. International health experts
say it is vital to have access to samples of the constantly-mutating
virus, which they fear could change into a form spreading more easily
among humans and sweep the world in months, killing millions of
people. "There is a strong working relationship between the WHO
country office and the government. Even if there is a conflict on
issues like virus-sharing, it hasn't eroded the ability to carry out
joint investigations," Rainford said.
