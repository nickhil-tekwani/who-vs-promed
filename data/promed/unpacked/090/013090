POTATO SPINDLE TUBER, TOMATO - AUSTRALIA (NSW) (02)

From: DL Hailstones <deborah.hailstones@agric.nsw.gov.au >

Surveys of greenhouse grown tomato plants in New South Wales (NSW) have
recently been finalised, with about 500 000 greenhouse tomato plants on 15
properties being surveyed over the past 12 months. No evidence of PSTVd
symptoms were observed. PSTVd was detected in 2 plants on one farm in 2001,
and that farm has been inspected approximately every month since that time,
with no evidence of disease symptoms in successive crops. Eradication of
the pathogen from that farm (and from the state) therefore appears to have
been successful and NSW is still considered to be free of PSTVd.
