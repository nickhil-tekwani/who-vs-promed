An outbreak of mumps has spurred Syracuse University [Onondaga County, New York] to offer students a 3rd "booster" shot of the measles, mumps, and rubella [MMR] vaccine.

As of [Mon 23 Oct 2017], there have been 27 confirmed and 48 probable cases of mumps on campus, according to Syracuse University Health Services. Mumps is a contagious disease caused by a virus spread through saliva and mucus.

Independent of this outbreak, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices -- a panel of medical and public health experts who meet 3 times a year to offer vaccination guidance for the United States -- will vote [Wed 25 Oct 2017; see report below] on whether to recommend the use of a 3rd dose of the MMR vaccine during outbreaks. Committee recommendations are reviewed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Other outbreaks in recent years, most notably one involving NHL [National Hockey League] players in 2014, have prompted the CDC to debate whether a 3rd dose of the vaccine should be recommended in such situations. A 3rd dose may prevent additional cases by further protecting those exposed to the virus.

Absent this official CDC recommendation, a 3rd dose is given during outbreaks on a case-by-case basis, such as the current one at Syracuse.

The health department of Onondaga county, where Syracuse University is located, reported 6 additional probable cases among non-campus members as of [Tue 24 Oct 2017].

Confirmed cases have been verified by laboratory testing, while probable cases only include likely though unconfirmed symptoms.

Mumps typically begins with fever, headache, muscle aches, tiredness, and loss of appetite lasting a few days. Most people will then see salivary glands swell, causing puffy cheeks and a swollen jaw.

3rd dose recommendation
-----------------------
The MMR vaccine is 88 percent effective when 2 doses have been given. In people who receive just one shot, the vaccine is less effective.

Most recent outbreaks have occurred among vaccinated people, according to Dr Manisha Patel, a medical officer at the CDC.

In weighing a possible recommendation on [Wed 25 Oct 2017], the CDC advisory committee will review data from recent outbreaks, including the number of vaccinated people who became infected. In its deliberations, the panel will assess the impact of a 3rd dose in decreasing the size and duration of outbreaks.

The CDC currently recommends that children get their 1st dose when they are 12-15 months old and a 2nd dose at 4-6 years.

Outbreaks of mumps tend to occur in areas where there is crowding and close contact, according to Patel. Campuses are a typical site for outbreaks because of the sharing of saliva: by coughing, sneezing, kissing, and sharing utensils, lipstick, or cigarettes.

Possible complications
----------------------
The incubation period for mumps ranges from 12-25 days; symptoms last at least 2 and usually more than 10 days. Mumps can occasionally cause complications, especially in adults. These include deafness and inflammation of the brain, ovaries, breast tissue, or testicles.

Since it is caused by a virus, mumps will not respond to antibiotics. Doctors generally recommend bed rest and over-the-counter pain relievers. Most people with mumps recover completely in a few weeks, according to the CDC.

Before the US mumps vaccination program started in 1967, the CDC received reports of 186 000 cases each year. The actual number of cases was probably much higher but not always reported since most doctors considered the mumps a typical childhood disease. Since the development of the vaccine, cases have decreased by more than 99 percent in the United States.

Each year, the number of mumps cases fluctuates within a range of a couple hundred to a couple thousand, according to Patel.

In 2016, the United States experienced the highest number of mumps cases in a decade: more than 6000, according to CDC preliminary reports.

The number of cases is high this year, too. As of 7 Oct 2017, the CDC has received reports of 4667 total mumps infections in 47 states and the District of Columbia for the year.

[2] MMR vaccine: 3rd dose
Date: Wed 25 Oct 2017

https://www.statnews.com/2017/10/25/mumps-vaccine-third-dose/


With the US facing a growing number of mumps outbreaks [see figure of cases by year at the source URL above], an expert panel that advises the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended [Wed 25 Oct 2017] that people who are at risk during outbreaks should receive an additional, 3rd dose of vaccine.

The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices unanimously voted to approve a 3rd dose of mumps-containing vaccine as a tool for outbreak control, despite acknowledging evidence to support the practice is limited.

The recommendation states that people who have had 2 doses of mumps vaccine but who are identified by public health officials as being at risk in a mumps outbreak should receive the 3rd dose.

Mumps-containing vaccine is either the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine or a vaccine that contains those 3 plus the chickenpox vaccine. Experts hope the recommendation will help address a problem that has bedeviled public health authorities recently.

After years of very low numbers of mumps cases -- fewer than 1000 cases nationally a year -- the disease has made a resurgence of sorts in the past decade or so. There were nearly 7000 cases nationally in 2006 and more than 6000 last year [2016]. As of early October [2017], there have been 4667 cases in 47 states and the District of Columbia so far in 2017. It's long been known that the mumps vaccine is less effective than those that protect against measles and rubella. Still, 2 doses of mumps vaccine -- the 1st given at between 12 and 15 months of age and the 2nd sometime between the ages of 4 and 6 years of age -- is thought to protect about 88 percent of people vaccinated.

However, as mumps outbreaks have increased, public health officials have noticed that children and young adults -- especially the latter -- who received both recommended doses of vaccine were among those contracting the disease. In some cases, including in a large outbreak of mumps in northern Arkansas [USA] earlier this year [2017], authorities have resorted to giving additional doses of the vaccine. But the evidence proving additional doses overcomes the problem of waning protection has been lacking.

Last month [September 2107] the New England Journal of Medicine published a study [see reference in item [1] above] that delved into the issue. It was based on data from a 2015-2016 mumps outbreak at the University of Iowa.

The researchers found that the longer it had been since a person received a 2nd dose of MMR vaccine, the more likely it was that he or she would contract the mumps. Students who had received their 2nd shot 13 years or more before the outbreak were 9 times more likely than more recently vaccinated students to be infected.

Given the recommended timing of MMR vaccination, teenagers and people in their early 20s could be vulnerable to contract mumps at a time when their lifestyles put them at higher risk, if they come in contact with the virus.

On [Wed 25 Oct 2016], a veteran vaccine expert -- Dr Stanley Plotkin, who is not a member of ACIP [Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices] -- suggested the committee should recommend a 3rd dose of mumps vaccine for all students entering university. But the idea was dismissed.

"We did discuss this question. But ... we did not feel that we had any evidence to support a decision about a routine [3rd] dose outside of an actual exposure situation where there was an immediate need for that vaccine," said Dr Kelly Moore, an ACIP member who chairs a work group that advises the panel on mumps vaccine. Moore is director of Tennessee's immunization program.

The mumps virus spreads in saliva; so activities like kissing, sharing drinks, and sharing cigarettes fuel its spread. Mumps outbreaks have been common on university campuses, but they have also occurred among athletes who play team sports. Several National Hockey League teams, for instance, have seen mumps spread along their benches.

The mumps virus causes symptoms that are common to lots of illnesses -- fever, headache, muscle aches. But the virus also infects salivary glands, leading to pronounced swelling on one or both sides of the face. It can also cause a painful condition known as orchitis -- swelling of the testicles -- in males who contract the virus after puberty.

Most cases are mild, but there are serious complications in rare cases, including encephalitis (inflammation of the brain), deafness, and infertility. Severe cases are less common among people who have been vaccinated but still contract mumps.

[Mumps elimination in the United States has never been documented. The Healthy People 2020 mumps goal is to reduce the number of US-acquired cases, rather than elimination The 3rd dose may help attain this new goal.

Also see, "Third MMR dose shows promise in curbing mumps outbreaks" http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2017/09/third-mmr-dose-shows-promise-curbing-mumps-outbreaks for a report on the impact of the 3rd dose of MMR on University of Iowa students during a mumps outbreak. "The attack rate was lower in students who received 3 doses than in their peers who had gotten only 2-6.7 versus 14.5 cases per 1000 population. The researchers calculated that the vaccine was associated with a 60 percent to 78 percent reduction in mumps risk. ...

The improvement noted in vaccine effectiveness between the 2- and 3-dose groups at 7 days after vaccination suggests that the benefit occurs shortly after vaccination, which is likely due to a booster response. ... They said other factors, such as a coordinated public health response, implementation of a standard case definition, rapid testing, isolation, and enhanced awareness, also probably played a role in the decline of the outbreak, which occurred rapidly. ...

The authors concluded that longer-term benefits of routine 3-dose MMR administration requires further study, but for now, a 3rd-dose may be useful for outbreak control. And the drop-off seen in immunity may be useful in helping health officials decide if a 3rd dose would be helpful in stemming outbreaks in highly vaccinated populations." - Mod.LK]

Health officials in Hawaii have reported a significant increase in mumps cases in the state's ongoing mumps outbreak. According to the Hawaii Department of Health, 500 cases of mumps have now been recorded, a 216-case increase since [24 Aug 2017]. The outbreak was first detected in March, with 409 cases recorded in Honolulu alone. Last year [2016], the state recorded a total of 10 mumps cases.

Manitoba's public health department has reached out to schools and daycares as the province's mumps outbreak continues its lengthy run.

In documents dated [19 Oct 2017], and making their way to the public this week, Manitoba Health, Seniors and Active Living asks parents and guardians of young children and post-secondary students and faculty to be aware of the symptoms of mumps, what to do if they suspect an infection and how to help prevent one.

"This letter serves as a reminder... to let people know the mumps outbreak is still continuing in Manitoba. It is important for people to know, even though they may not be hearing as much about it, that it is still ongoing," Dr Elise Weiss, acting chief provincial public health officer, said [Tue 24 Oct 2017].

(With schools back in session and students in close quarters, "the goal of sending this letter out (is) there are measures people can take to help protect themselves."

As of last [Thu 19 Oct 2017], there had been 1150 confirmed cases of the contagious viral infection since the beginning of the outbreak [1 Sep 2016], Manitoba Health says. The province normally experiences fewer than 10 cases a year.

The mumps occur mostly in children, commonly involving fever, headache, swollen salivary glands and cheeks, and difficulty chewing, swallowing, or talking. Symptoms appear 12-25 days after exposure to the virus through direct contact with the saliva of an infected person, and usually last for a week or more.

There is no treatment; prevention (especially via immunization) is the most important form of protection and management, Manitoba Health says in its bulletin, which is to be distributed to all school divisions, post-secondary institutions, and registered daycares.

Winnipeg School Division [WSD] senior information officer Radean Carter said Tue afternoon [24 Oct 2017] she had yet to see the Manitoba Health reminder, but once it is logged, it will be passed on to all principals and vice-principals "and they will share the information with parents."

Each WSD school will disseminate the information as it best sees fit, she said, with most making contact with parents and guardians via email lists, while some will also print the document to be sent home with students.

WSD is the largest in the city with more than 33 000 students attending 78 facilities.

Meanwhile, a year into the outbreak, the number of cases continues its slow climb, rising from 853 confirmed in the province as of [31 Aug 2017].

"In many outbreaks, you will have your general, bell-shaped curve: you'll start slow, peak and then wane out. With mumps, what we are seeing is more... of a flatter, straighter line," Weiss said, adding Manitoba Health is keeping a close eye on the age groups involved, not just the total number.

"We see (mumps) in certain numbers every year in Manitoba and across Canada, so we have an average. When goes above that average, we start looking at it in terms of: is it meeting other criteria for an outbreak?" she said.

"It would be the same thing for calling an end. A year ago, we had an increased number... in a university-aged population which has now spread to all age groups. The same criteria would be used to say it's over: it goes back down to baseline levels."

While the information contained in the mumps bulletin is important, Weiss said -- stressing the need for good hand hygiene and to stay home when sick -- it is not uncommon for Manitoba Health to issue such public reminders, pointing out the department's annual flu season push and a notice for a German measles outbreak in the 1990s.
