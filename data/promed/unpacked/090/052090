[Once again the media are our best source of information on suspected
outbreaks in the Pacific Islands. Can our colleagues inform on the matter,
CONFIRM and UPDATE the rest of the PACNET community so that appropriate
preventive response could be both taken at PICTs level and some
complementary assistance may be offered, if necessary. Thanks -- YS]

Local and federal health officials have issued an alert against the
possible outbreak of Japanese encephalitis [JE] in the Commonwealth of the
Northern Mariana Islands [CNMI]. This follows the death of four-year old
Chamorro girl who is suspected to have died of the said mosquito-borne
disease. The Department of Public Health (DPH) has revealed another
four-year old child is currently showing symptoms of JE infection.
Both DPH and the US CDC are closely
studying the two cases. DPH is advising the community to seriously take
precautionary measures to avoid mosquito-borne virus illnesses such as JE
and dengue, which is endemic during the rainy season.
Acting Health Secretary Ned Arriola pointed out however that both DPH and
CDC are yet to confirm if the girl really died of JE. "It is only a
suspected case of Japanese encephalitis. We still have to confirm whether
the girl died of the disease or some other virus, although she showed
symptoms of it," Arriola said.
Saipan recorded an outbreak of Japanese encephalitis in October 1990 with
14 reported cases, resulting in one death. Issuing a stern warning to the
community, Arriola said the current weather condition has increased the
breeding of adult mosquitoes, which are carriers of life-threatening viral
disease. The Marianas Division of Public Health has initiated a
house-to-house inspection within the 300-meter radius from the houses of
the two children. Simultaneous education on mosquito prevention and
elimination of breeding sites are being done during the inspections.
Arriola said health officials also inspected blood samples of the victims,
as well as of people residing within the 300-meter radius from the victims'
residence.
