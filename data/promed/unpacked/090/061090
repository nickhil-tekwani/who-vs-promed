The anti-dengue campaign in Tacloban City has shown some positive
results as the recent number of confirmed and suspected dengue cases
here has drastically dropped from July's [2010] figure. From the 370
dengue cases reported in July, only 18 new dengue cases were recorded
from 1-13 Aug [2010], said Mel Maravilles, nurse sentinel of the City
Health Office, in a media forum [in Tacloban City] Saturday [14 Aug
2010]. However, the number of deaths due to dengue in Tacloban City
over the last 8 months now stood at 16, with a school boy from
Barangay [village] Otap as the latest victim. He died of dengue last
3 Aug [2010].

The total number of confirmed and suspected dengue cases in Tacloban
since January this year [2010] has reached 1401, Maravilles said. He
said that of the total dengue cases in the city, only 20 were
confirmed cases, 13 were probable cases and 1368 were suspected
cases. Maravilla said they were still in the process of verifying the
18 suspected cases in August [2010], which, while showing symptoms of
dengue fever, had yet to be confirmed through laboratory tests.

He said there has been an increase of dengue vectors in the city,
especially in the barangay, which has been why they have been
sustaining their anti-dengue drive in the villages. In July [2010],
the Office of the City Mayor and the city health office led a massive
anti-dengue drive in four dengue hot spots in the city, cleaning the
surroundings and destroying probable breeding sites of mosquitoes.

More than 50 000 people have suffered from dengue fever this year
[2010], and 63 have died, Deputy Public Health Minister Pansiri
Kulanartsiri said yesterday [14 Aug 2010].

She said that the dengue epidemic this year [2010] was up from the
same period last year [2009] by 83 per cent.

In the South, 13 045 people contracted the fever, along with 14 509
patients in the Central region, 13 635 in the Northeast, and 7325
people in the North.

Of all the patients, 7 were aged less than 28 days and 409 aged 65 or older.

The Department of Disease Control's director-general, Dr Manit
Teeratantikanont, said 80 per cent of the patients were bitten by
mosquitoes inside their homes.

Lots of people suffering from dengue fever indicated that the
quantity of common house mosquitoes that carry the disease was high.
There is no vaccine for preventing dengue fever, said Pansiri, who
urged all households nationwide to help reduce the number of
mosquitoes to protect themselves from the fever. She advised people
to try to get rid of mosquito larvae in vessels holding water by
changing the water every 7 days. Pansiri said people should cover
vessels holding water to prevent mosquitoes from laying their eggs.

The deputy minister, who was accompanied by Manit, presided yesterday
[14 Aug 2010] over the opening of a concert in Samut Prakan province
to promote dengue fever protection.

Dengue cases continue to rise in the city [Delhi] with 20 people
testing positive on Monday [16 Aug 2010] taking the count of those
affected by the disease to 254. "20 people tested positive for dengue
fever on Monday [16 Aug 2010]. With this, the total number of people
who tested positive for dengue since June [2010] has risen to 254,"
NK Yadav, MCD's [Municipal Corporation of Delhi] medical health officer, said.

After a spurt in dengue cases was reported in Jamia Nagar, Yadav said
the MCD has appointed an epidemiologist who will look after the area.

He also said that the number of hand-operated fogging machines has
been doubled especially in the Commonwealth Games village to curb the
dengue menace. "Fogging is effective for only 2 days. Dengue fever
can be prevented if mosquito breeding can be controlled," the official said.

[The number of dengue cases in Delhi continues to slowly rise.
Fogging is indeed a temporary control measure. Elimination of
breeding sites in water catchments provides longer-term control.

Dengue took the life of the 7th victim in Puerto Rico so far this
year [2010], the sub secretary of the Health Department, Concepcion
Quinones de Longo, stated today [14 Aug 2010]. The victim was a man
of about 40 years of age.

The [USA] CDC reported that during [epidemiological] week 29 of this
year (16-22 Jul [2010]), there were 835 dengue cases, which is 716
cases above the epidemic threshold, while there were 25 DHF cases detected.

"If the population does not take the situation with the seriousness
that it deserves, then we will continue to see this alarming trend in
reported cases. We need urgency and overwhelming action," the
official stated. Quinones de Longo stated that prevention measures
against dengue are utilization of repellents, spraying of the
interior of houses, and identification of mosquito breeding sites in
the areas around houses.

The [Jalisco] State Health Secretariat (SJS) is vigilant for the 4
serotypes of dengue virus, which have been circulating for one year,
and the reason for which the State Public Health Laboratory is now
conducting research to identify strains that could be present in
Jalisco. "We are very concerned because we recognize that we have
confirmed the circulation of the 4 serotypes of dengue [virus] for
more than a year," said the head of the agency, Alfonso Petersen Farah.

The secretary explained that the reason to be alert, when referring
to people who have had the infection, is that if they have already
had one of the serotypes of dengue [is protected against only that
specific serotype, but] they run the risk of a 2nd infection by any
of the other [virus] serotypes, and, therefore, complications that
carry a higher risk of evolving into a serious type of dengue, he
said. "That's the reason why, in the state of Jalisco since last week
[week of 2 Aug 2010], we are undertaking the direct investigation (of
viruses)," he said and added that the materials for identification of
serotypes are already available.

So far this year [2010], there is only evidence of circulation of
serotype 1 dengue virus in Jalisco, but last year [2009, dengue
virus] 1 and 3 were in circulation. Even with a single serotype, the
migratory flow makes Jalisco susceptible to this infection by a
serotype circulating in another country or state.

The Ministry of Health [MoH] announced that the number of dengue
victims has increased to 57, with the confirmation today [15 Aug
2010] of the death of an 8-month old girl. According to the National
Commission for Dengue Certification of the MoH, in the week just
ended [8-14 Aug 2010] 14 fatal DHF victims were registered. The
agency added that [the number of] classical dengue fever patients has
exceeded 40 000 people and the hemorrhagic variant has affected more
than 2000 people. However, health authorities stated that [there is]
a slight tendency for reduction of cases, although the number of DHF
cases continues to increase. The current epidemic is considered the
most serious one that this Central American country has faced in the
last 3 decades.

Public and private institutions maintain a national prevention
campaign to halt the propagation of the virus, the incidence of which
became more serious with the beginning of the rainy season in Central America.

Nicaraguan health authorities today [14 Aug 2010] confirmed 6 dengue
deaths to date in 2010, while [neighboring] Honduras confirmed 55 DHF
deaths during the same period, according to official reports.

The minister of health (MINSA) of Nicaragua, Sonia Castro, said this
Friday [13 Aug 2010] that the government continues on a maximum state
of alert given the thousands of [dengue cases] reported locally and
in the Central America region. Dr Edmundo Sanchez, director of health
surveillance of Nicaragua, confirmed that at least 5000 suspected
classical dengue fever cases have been registered with 6 deaths.

In Honduras the National Commission for Dengue Certification
confirmed 12 new DHF deaths in the current week for a total of 55
cases registered in the past 2 weeks. The Honduras authorities have
confirmed a total of 39 618 classical dengue fever, 1099 of DHF, and 55 deaths.

In Guatemala as of the beginning of the month [August 2010], at least
13 deaths and almost 7000 dengue cases were reported, while in Costa
Rica nearly 16 000 cases of the [dengue virus] infection transmitted
by the mosquito _Aedes aegypti_ [were reported].

The minister of health of Nicaragua, Sonia Castro, confirmed that the
government will intensify house-to-house fumigation campaigns to
destroy mosquito breeding sites.

The official confirmed that the 4 serotypes of the virus are
circulating in the country, but stated that of all the positive
reported [dengue] cases, [dengue virus] serotype 4 has not been
found, "we have confirmed only positive cases of infection by [virus]
serotype 3," she stated.

Costa Rica reported an alarming increase of 5000 dengue cases during
the last week, as confirmed today [15 Aug 2010] by the Caja
Costarricense del Seguro Social (CCSS) [Costa Rican Social Security
Agency]. According to official data, this Central America country
counted more than 16 200 affected people up to the past week and
registered at the present time a total of 21 200 [dengue] infected
individuals. The authorities stated their concern, since the number
of affected individuals currently exceeds the statistics of previous
years and could continue to increase with the arrival of the rainy season.

In Costa Rica, dengue virus serotypes 1, 2, and 3 circulate,
transmitted by the mosquito _Aedes aegypti_. Costa Rica remains on
alert for the proximity of dengue [virus] serotype 4, which now has
been reported in other countries of the region such as Nicaragua and
Honduras. This virus type still has not been reported in Costa Rica,
and it is feared that the Costa Rican population will be highly
susceptible to its infection, especially those who have had
[infections with] dengue [virus] types 1,2, and 3.

Up to now, most affected patients in Costa Rica are around 20-40 years of age.
