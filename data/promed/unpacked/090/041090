We have been able to collate losses from the ASF outbreak in Ibadan
between June and September 2001. According to the records of the
officially recognized Pig Farmers Association of Nigeria (Oyo State
Branch), a total of 23 155 pigs of various ages were lost to the
outbreak from 246 herds in and around Ibadan, Oyo State, Nigeria. I
believe the figures could be up to 25% higher because not all pig
farmers belong to the association. I have compared some of the
individual reports they compiled with our own field data and find
their records credible.
