If chemical factors are considered in the etiology of these cases, the
clinical description is consistent with acute exposure to pentachlorophenol
(particularly high fever, and rapid progression to life threatening
symptoms). There have been several historical accounts of acute poisoning
caused by exposure to pentachlorophenol. In 1967, a cluster of cases of
critical illness in a newborn nursery occurred as a result of the misuse of
sodium pentachlorophenate as an antimildew agent in the hospital laundry,
resulting in 9 cases and 2 fatalities. In these cases, exposure was thought
to have occurred across intact skin

There are also reports of systemic intoxication in adults from occupational
exposure across intact skin. A consistent finding that has been described
on autopsy of fatal cases is the immediate onset of extreme rigor mortis,
which is considered a hallmark of pentachlorophenol poisoning (Jorens PG,
Schepens PJ. Human pentachlorophenol poisoning, Hum Exp Tox 1993; 12:
479-95, Gray RE, Gilliand RD, Smith EE, et al Pentachlorophenol
intoxication: report of a fatal case, with comments on the clinical course
and pathologic anatomy. Arch Env Health 1985; 40(3): 16104, Mason MF,
Wallace SM, Foerster E, et al. Pentachlorophenol poisoning: report of two
cases J Forens Sci 1965; 10: 136-7).
