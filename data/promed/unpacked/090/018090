THE COMING PLAGUE: TV DOCUMENTARY: ORDERING INFORMATION (02)

For those of you outside the USA:
I've just called the 800 number
given by Phyllis Williams, only to be told to call 1-800-672-6202
for orders from outside the US [and British International Directory
enquiries told me there was no listing for Warner Home Videos in
Canton MI !].
The person at 1-800-672-6202 told me she could only
ship to an address in the US or Canada, so I gave a friend's address
in MD and paid by VISA. Clearly this only works if you have an
address in the US or Canada that you can have the tape shipped to,
but it's better than nothing!
