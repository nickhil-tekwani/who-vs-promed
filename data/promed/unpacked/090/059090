Caribbean: First Human Cases of West Nile Virus Infection in Cuba
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Cuba has joined the group of countries in the Caribbean region reporting
West Nile virus (WNV). The Cuban Health Ministry has reported the first 3
human cases of West Nile Virus infection. The patients developed clinical
manifestations as encephalitis, headache and muscle weakness and required
hospitalization, however the 3 patients [have] recovered. CSF or sera
samples were positive for IgM & IgG WNV antibodies. The patients were
localized in Villa Clara and Sancti Spiritus provinces in the center of the
island.
On the other hand 4 equine serum samples were also positive by competition
ELISA and haemagglutination inhibition tests. The positive horses were
detected in Havana City and Havana Province. All these probable human and
equine cases were confirmed by neutralization assay with the WNV NY-99
strain at the Health Canada National Microbiology Laboratory, Winnipeg.
[These results] confirm WNV activity in the Island although the virus has
not been detected in birds since 2002 when Cuban WNV Surveillance was
established.

[It will be interesting to learn in due course how many people have been
exposed to West Nile virus and do not exhibit symptoms of disease.
ProMED-mail would like to thank our colleagues in Cuba for sharing this
report with us. - Mods.CP/MPP]
