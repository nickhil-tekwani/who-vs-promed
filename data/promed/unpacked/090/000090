Another Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever [CCHF] virus patient died at the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Center in the late night hours, raising the number of deaths from the deadly disease in Karachi to 9.

Joint Executive Director, JPMC Dr Seemin Jamali said that a 36-year-old woman, a resident of Hyderabad, died of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever. The patient was brought to the hospital's Emergency Department in the night hours and was later moved to an isolation ward for treatment, where she died after an hour. She was suffering from Congo fever. This was the 3rd death reported in the institution.

A total of 9 deaths have been reported in hospitals of Karachi, out of which 6 were in private hospitals and 3 in Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Center. According to officials, 3 of the patients were from Karachi, 2 each from Bahawalpur and Afghanistan, one from Hyderabad, and one from elsewhere in Sindh, respectively. Over 71 Congo patients have been admitted to hospitals in Karachi this year [2016].

Health experts said Congo fever is a deadly viral disease that spreads through tick-bites in animals and people. Those persons who deal with dairy farming and livestock are likely to get infected and carry the virus. The CCHFv-infected person can infect other people; therefore, precautionary measures are necessary for people who deal animals.

[There has been no increase in CCHF cases in the country as was expected and feared following the Eid-Ul Adha celebrations.

The report does not specify any epidemiological details or exposure history of the fatal case, which would be helpful to understand disease transmission. - Mod.UBA
