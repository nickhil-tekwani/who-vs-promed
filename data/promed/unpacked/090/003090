Cat scratch disease is clearly a misnomer, earlier this year we had a case
of classical cat scratch with cervical lympadenopathy after a pet ferret
bit its 5 year old owner on the neck. The diagnosis was confirmed
serologically by Dr Harrison at the Central Public Health Laboratory,
Colindale. Unfortunately we were unable to obtain any samples from the
animal, whose fate remains shrouded in mystery!

[From my experience of ferrets as a boy in England poaching rabbits during
the early '50s the child was fortunate to merely acquire cat scratch fever.
But the ferrets I knew were hard working, large, white 'polecats'. The new
domesticated strain is smaller and prettier, even cute. It would have been
interesting to know if this ferret had been in contact with domestic cats.
