Paralysis cases spiked after a vaccination drive was derailed by false rumors that dozens of children had collapsed and died.

After serious setbacks in April [2019] led to a cluster of new polio cases, Pakistan is revamping its vaccination strategy in a renewed effort to wipe out the virus. The country is one of just 3 -- along with Afghanistan and perhaps Nigeria -- in which polio is still endemic. Eradication of the virus in Pakistan is crucial to the drive to rid the world of polio, once and for all.

Now, vaccination teams will take a friendlier approach, ask fewer questions, make fewer follow-up visits, and stop recording extensive details about the families they visit, Pakistan's polio eradication program announced. Families were intimidated by the questions, and vaccinators spent too much time filling out the registration forms introduced in 2016, said Babar Atta, the polio coordinator in the prime minister's office, according to local media.

A new vaccination drive is scheduled for the 2nd week of June [2019]; thousands of teams will spread out around the country trying to reach almost 40 million children under age 10. Many vaccinators will go house to house, while others will look for families with young children in refugee camps, in train and bus stations, and at highway checkpoints.

Pakistan has had 17 [now 19 reported] cases of polio paralysis this year [2019]; it had only 3 by this date last year [2018] and only 12 in all of 2018.

In mid-April [2019], widespread panic among parents in Peshawar and the surrounding northern tribal areas forced the suspension of a national immunization drive. A scaremongering video had spread on Twitter, purporting to show students collapsing after getting an expired batch of vaccine. The video seemed obviously fake. The boys in it flop prone across a hospital bed on cue after the speaker waves his hand; one even makes a funny face on camera. Also, expired vaccine -- if it was expired -- is harmless.

Nonetheless, "our TV channels found it profitable to cover this nonsense," Aziz Memon, a textile executive who leads Rotary International's involvement in Pakistan's anti-polio campaign, said in an interview in New York. "It became a national event."

Rumors spread that 50 children had died; mosques used their loudspeakers to tell parents to rush their children to medical care. Hospitals were swamped as more than 25 000 children arrived.

"No one had died," Mr. Memon said. "But we had to call everything off."

Local politics were behind the scare, he said. District elections were underway, and the conservative Jamaat-e-Islami party was trying to discredit the polio campaign, which is supported by Prime Minister Imran Khan's Tehreek-e-Insaf party. The man speaking in the video was arrested.

To restore confidence, Mr. Memon added, the district health and communications ministers appeared on television, giving vaccine drops to their own children.

Because suspicion of the campaign remains high in some areas -- vaccinators have been accused of marking targets for American drones -- interactions with families will now be briefer and less intrusive. Residents will be asked only how many children are in the household and whether they have been vaccinated.

In Pakistan, extended families often live in large compounds; previously, they were asked about all couples inside, whether they were married, how many children each couple had, and who was pregnant. Sometimes the police arrested families who refused vaccinations.

"That was not helpful," Mr. Memon said. "If you drag people to the police station, they feel insulted. Now, we will have a friendly chat. You don't have to challenge the refusers; you give them a pep talk and encourage the religious leaders to persuade them."

In early April [2019], a campaign worker trying to persuade a family to vaccinate was shot dead, apparently by an 18-year-old family member who then fled to nearby Afghanistan. As compensation, Rotary International gave the family of the campaign worker, Wajid Ali, 32 [years old], about USD 3300 [about PKR 500 000], and the local government promised his brother a job.

In an encouraging sign, Mr. Memon said, the polio virus is no longer found in sewage samples in Karachi, Pakistan's biggest city, so transmission there may have been halted.

Polio transmission has never been interrupted in Pakistan and Afghanistan; most of the cases are in the mountainous districts along the border, where government control is weak.

Nigeria has not had a confirmed polio paralysis case since 2016, but it takes at least 3 years without confirmed cases despite vigorous surveillance before a country is declared polio free [see comment below].

The Lagos state government says it has uncovered a plot by a non-governmental organisation (NGO) to disrupt the ongoing polio vaccination in the state by administering harmful vaccines to children. Dr Jide Lawal, permanent secretary, Primary Healthcare Board, made this known on Tuesday night [21 May 2019] in Lagos.

Lawal said that the organisation, which he did not name, was going around schools in the state to administer vaccines believed to be harmful to children. He said that the state Ministry of Health had commenced an investigation into the allegation.

According to Lawal, the ministry suspected that the sabotage was intended to disrupt the ongoing polio immunisation campaign.

"The move by the NGO is intended to thwart other efforts of the state government in maintaining 100% immunisation coverage of eligible children as well as maintain the "polio-free status" attained since 2009.

"For the purpose of clarity, it is important to mention that the safety of lives and the wellbeing of citizens are of utmost importance to the state government, and all efforts are geared toward protecting the citizenry. Hence, we wish to emphasise that the oral polio vaccine is free, safe, and effective in protecting children against polio.

"We will also like to assure you that the administration of this vaccine is not hazardous or dangerous to humans as being erroneously propagated. In fact, the World Health Organisation (WHO) recommends that all children below the age of 5 years get this vaccine for protection against polio, " Lawal said.

He added that the benefits of receiving the polio vaccination and other scheduled immunisations were numerous.

"Good health and survival of children have been associated with immunisation, because it reduces disability, morbidity, and mortality. It also contributes to lowering the incidence of diseases and results in less frequent visits to health facilities.

"Immunisation remains the most cost-effective and efficient child survival strategy for children who are the future of the nation. Also, this informs our unrelenting efforts in protecting our children from the vaccine-preventable killer diseases," he said.

Lawal urged stakeholders, including parents, political and religious leaders, civil society organisations, and mass media to ensure that children under 5 years were immunised free of charge.

He said, "This is to ensure that we reduce the risk of death and disability from vaccine-preventable diseases such as polio."

He said the current vaccination campaign against polio was being conducted by the National Primary Healthcare Development Agency, state Ministry of Health, and Lagos state Primary Healthcare Board.

According to Lawal, this is in partnership with health development partners such as World Health Organisation (WHO) United Nations Children Fund (UNICEF) CDC-AFENET and Rotary.

"While the state collaborates with NGOs, the administration of vaccines is the sole responsibility of health workers trained to conduct the exercise. The public are, therefore, enjoined to be vigilant and authenticate the identity of immunisation officers," Lawal said. "They should report any suspicion about the implementation of any of the state or national immunisation campaigns to the nearest local government, the Ministry of Education, or the Ministry of Health, or call 08023020581," he added.

[I'm posting these media reports as examples of the politics of health. When the incident occurred in Pakistan in April [2019], the media reports had not covered the politics behind the scare tactics. A very sorry state of affairs that politicians are using children and their health to manipulate voters in their areas. One can't help but wonder how much of the global anti-vaccine movement (significantly contributing to the global increase in measles) has a political basis behind it as well.

The change in approach to the campaign activities might well help win over many of the vaccine refusers in Pakistan. One hopes that will be the case.

With respect to WPV [wild poliovirus] in Nigeria, it is important to mention that with respect to the WPV1 [wild poliovirus type 1] isolated in Nigeria in 2016, "It is the 1st WPV1 detected in Nigeria since July 2014. Genetic sequencing of the isolated viruses suggest they are most closely linked to WPV1 last detected in Borno in 2011, indicating the strain has been circulating without detection since that time" (see Poliomyelitis update (11): Nigeria (BO) 20160811.4410331). Hence caution is needed in interpreting the observation that the absence of new cases since 2016 suggests Nigeria can be safely declared as having interrupted transmission of the WPV. And given the highly political nature of polio in Pakistan, one can't help but wonder if 3 years without a case is a fail-safe time to declare interruption of transmission there as well.

As for this current situation, the media report is unclear whether rumors have been circulating re: administration of harmful vaccines or if the NGO is administering vaccines claiming the government is administering bad vaccine. Notwithstanding the potential impact of this is an increase in vaccine refusal in Lagos as well as in neighboring areas when they learn of this. Another example of the politics of health impacting on the lives of children in a country.
