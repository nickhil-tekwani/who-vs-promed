A health warning has been issued in Gujarat's flood-ravaged city of Surat
following 2 deaths due to suspected hantavirus pulmonary syndrome.
Hantavirus spreads through rat urine, droppings or saliva and affects the
kidneys, lungs, pulmonary system or the heart.
The warning was issued late Wednesday [23 Aug 2006] and people have been
asked to take precautions and avoid large gatherings since the possibility
of contracting the virus is high.
Vikas Desai, head of the preventive social medicine department, said 2
people -- ages 24 and 36 years, both residents of the Katargam area in
Surat, died due to the disease.
Desai, however, ruled out the possibility of plague in the city. "Tests
have not revealed any plague symptoms so far. Serum samples collected from
the patients have been sent to the New Delhi-based National Institute of
Communicable Diseases for further tests," said Desai.
After the week-long deluge, people began fleeing the city in large numbers
fearing epidemics. Memories of the 1994 plague continue to haunt the people
of Surat and not too many are ready to take any chances.

[Two fatal hantavirus cases in India were reported in 2005 by Dr. Jan
Clement in ProMED post 20051105.3240, which included an excellent review of
hantaviruses in India. These 2 cases are presented in Clinical Infectious
Diseases (cited below). Serological tests in the Clement et al. study
implicated Puumala virus or a hantavirus antigenically related to it as the
etiological agent in these 2 cases. The only hantavirus previously known
to occur in India was Thottapalayam virus isolated from the house shrew,
_Suncus murinus_, and is not known to be a cause of human disease. Given
its ubiquity, Seoul virus is likely present in India as well.
ProMED requests additional information about the 2 fatal cases reported
here and the laboratory results (virological or serological) that
established hantavirus etiology.
Avoidance of large gatherings is prudent for pneumonic plague, but not
necessary for hantavirus infection, as it is not a crowd disease. Rather,
as this report indicates, is contracted through exposure to excrement from
infected rodents.
