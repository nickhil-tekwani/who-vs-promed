["Equine infectious anemia (EIA) is a systemic virus infection which affects horses, ponies, donkeys, mules and zebras. The disease represents no danger for humans. The virus is mainly transmitted by large blood-sucking insects, such as horseflies and stable flies. Transmission of the disease is also possible through direct contact between horses (blood, small wounds) and iatrogenically (by medical treatment, in particular when one needle/syringe is used for several animals). This remediless infectious disease of equids mainly occurs in North and South America, Africa, Asia, Australia, as well as in Southern and Eastern Europe;" https://www.fli.de/en/news/animal-disease-situation/equine-infectious-anemia/. - Mod.CRD
