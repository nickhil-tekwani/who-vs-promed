Rat poison-laced dog biscuits have been found in several yards near Lexington Parkway and Minnehaha Avenue over the past week. St Paul [Minnesota] police confirm at least 2 dogs have been poisoned as a result of consuming the biscuits. The poisonings have pet owners in the Frogtown area on edge.

[A resident] told Fox 9 his 8-year-old terrier is his best friend. But if he had not been keeping a close eye on her the other day, she may not still be keeping him company. The poison-laced biscuits were planted in his yard on or before [31 Jul 2016]. "It would've really hurt if I hadn't caught her with it," [the man] said. "I had a dog poisoned as a child and I don't want to go through that again."

A neighbor had warned [the terrier's owner] earlier that week about the biscuits, so when he saw the dog with the treat he was able to get it from her right away. [The man] said at least 2 other dog owners in his neighborhood have dealt with poisoned dogs. "You really have to hate a lot of things I think to try to poison animals," he said.

[Sgt Mike Ernster with the St Paul Police Department said the department] has received 2 official reports of dog poisonings near Lexington Parkway and Minnehaha Avenue. "I know my dog would eat anything at any time in any yard," Sgt Ernster told Fox 9 [Wed 3 Aug 2016].

Ernster said pets that have ingested rat poison will often exhibit symptoms that mimic natural illnesses. The news has nearby pet owners worried for the safety of their own animals. "I got scared so I check the yard every day," a woman said. Anytime she and her dog are outside now, she is on high alert. "If [the suspect] is doing it to dogs, [they] might be doing it to kids," she worried.

Despite the terrier owner's relief that his dog is safe, he hopes the person responsible for poisoning her, and other St Paul pets will end the senselessness. "Knock it off. Knock it off and get some help," he said of his message to the suspect.

Minnesota state law considers the poisoning of an animal a gross misdemeanor. St Paul Police are asking anyone who has observed suspicious activity connected to this animal cruelty crime to call them or the city's animal control center a call at 651-266-1100.

[Dog owners should always be aware of this danger. If you see dog treats or biscuits scattered in your front yard, that is, where there is public access, or by a back fence, pick them up immediately just in case. If there have been incidents of poisoning your local small animal clinic will have seen cases. Let you local police know just in case so they are aware. - Mod.MHJ

The article mentions rat poison. There are many different types of rodenticide. The majority are anticoagulant rodenticides, but there is also a neurological form of rodenticide. This article does not tell us any clinical signs so it is difficult to know what type of rodenticide was used. Likely the bait (biscuits) has been tested to know there is a rodenticide present.

Sadly, more and more rodenticides on the market are becoming the neurological from, for which there is currently no treatment.
For the anticoagulant forms of rodenticide, vitamin K is a recommended treatment. - Mod.TG
