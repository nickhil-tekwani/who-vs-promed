Agriculturalists' Association of Turkey (TZD) President Ibrahim Yetkin said that a viral disease that emerged after recent heavy rains threatens to lead to a serious decline in wheat production across Turkey, which will eventually bring about a price increase in wheat products. He said farmers are seeing the spread of a plant virus known as PAS following the heavy rains over the past week that flooded wheat farms in numerous provinces.

He said the disease has heavily damaged the crops before they could be harvested. "We could have minimized the damage had the farmers applied pesticide to crops. ... I assume most farmers skipped this process because they could not afford the chemicals."

Turkey was already suffering declines in wheat crop yields due to a lack of rainfall through the autumn and winter seasons. Seeds could not germinate in some places. Following the drought, heavy rainfall also led to crop rot before crops could be gathered. The TZD head predicted that Turkey could see its wheat production decline by as much as 20 percent this year [2014] over 2013, given such problems. [The country is] one of Europe's largest wheat producers [but] might need to import wheat to meet demand at home this year [2014].

[Barley yellow dwarf (BYD) disease occurs worldwide and is the most destructive of virus diseases of wheat. Grain yields may be reduced
by one third. It attacks a wide range of grass species (_Gramineae_) including wheat, oats, rice, maize, rye, and barley. Oats are usually considered more susceptible than wheat. Symptoms include leaf discolouration from yellow to purple (depending on the host species), stunting, reduced tillering, and empty seed heads. Plants infected in autumn may not survive the winter or show severe symptoms when growth resumes. Diseased plants often occur in circular patches within the field, which are associated with colonisation by the aphid vectors.

BYD viruses have now been split into several species in the family _Luteoviridae_ (mostly in the genus _Luteovirus_) and are differentiated by their ability to be transmitted by various aphid species and their virulence on a selected variety of oats. The _Barley yellow dwarf virus-PAS_ species belongs to genus _Luteovirus_ and has recently been separated from BYDV-PAV (type species of the genus). Some of the viruses are transmitted equally well by several aphids, whereas others can be transmitted by only one or 2 species. They cannot be transmitted by seed, pollen, or mechanical means and cannot survive in stubble or in the soil. Volunteer cereal plants or grassy weeds may serve as pathogen reservoirs. Disease management includes use of resistant cultivars and control of the aphid vectors (as referred to in the story above).
