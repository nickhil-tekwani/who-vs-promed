We hear from a reliable source that an outbreak suspected to be due to
yellow fever began in February 2001 on the border of Ghana & Burkino Faso,
with 9 suspected cases including 6 deaths. Immunization is reported to be
in progress in both countries.
ProMED-mail would be interested in further information.
