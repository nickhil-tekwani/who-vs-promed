2000/046E - Serrano golden mosaic begomovirus
---------------------------------------------
Why: Serrano golden mosaic begomovirus came to our attention as causing an
emerging disease of capsicum and tomato in the Americas.
Where: Serrano golden mosaic begomovirus was first reported by Brown &
Poulos (1990) in tomato and capsicum crops in Sinaloa (Mexico) and Arizona
(USA). On Internet, its presence is also reported in Sonora (Mexico) and
Texas (USA).
Distribution: Mexico (Sinaloa, Sonora), USA (Arizona, Texas).
On which plants: Tomato (_Lycopersicon esculentum_), capsicum (_Capsicum
annuum_). In transmission experiments, the virus can cause symptoms to
_Capsicum frutescens_.
Damage: Symptoms on tomato: golden foliar mosaic; on capsicum: yellow
mosaic. Fruit deformation. It is reported that in 1989, the disease could
affect 80-100 % of the plants in symptomatic fields in Sinoaloa, and that
the virus was detected in numerous tomato and pepper samples.
Transmission: Transmitted by _Bemisia tabaci_.
Pathway: Infected tomato and capsicum plants, fruits?, viruliferous _B.
tabaci_ from countries where Serrano golden mosaic begomovirus occurs.
Possible risks: Tomato and capsicum are important crops in the EPPO region,
both indoor and outdoor. Data on severity and extent of the disease is
lacking, and very little data is available in the literature on this virus.
The vector is present in many parts of the EPPO region.
