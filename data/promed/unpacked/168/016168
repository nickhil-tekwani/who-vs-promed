Guinea's government said on Wed [3 Sep 2014] that EVD had spread to a previously unaffected region of the country, as US experts warned that the worst ever outbreak of the deadly virus was spiraling out of control in West Africa.

Guinea, the 1st country to detect the hemorrhagic fever in March [2014], had said it was containing the outbreak, but authorities announced that 9 new cases had been found in the southeastern prefecture of Kerouane. The area, some 750 km (470 miles) southeast of the capital Conakry, lies close to where the virus was 1st detected deep in Guinea's forest region. ... The 9 confirmed cases were in the town of Damaro in the Kerouane region, with a total of 18 people under observation, the health ministry said in a statement. The latest outbreak started after the arrival of an infected person from neighboring Liberia, the ministry said. ...

[2] CDC: window for bringing EVD under control is closing fast

A man who left an Ebola quarantine center in Monrovia in search of food was jeered by an angry and fearful crowd at a local market. The man was subsequently chased down by doctors and forced into an ambulance. Leading international health officials said Tuesday [2 Sep 2014] that the EVD epidemic in West Africa is accelerating, and the window for getting it under control is closing.

"Six months into the worst EVD epidemic in history, the world is losing the battle to contain it," Joanne Liu, international president of medical charity Doctors Without Borders [Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF)], said in a briefing at the United Nations. She faulted world leaders for failing to recognize the severity of the crisis sooner and said charities and West African governments alone do not have the capacity to stem the outbreak.

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] director Tom Frieden, who returned on Mon [12 Sep 2014] from a week-long trip to the countries hardest hit by the epidemic -- Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea -- said he was shocked by how rapidly the disease is spreading.

[3] Military medical help called for, rejected

International president of Medecins Sans Frontieres [MSF, Doctors Without Borders] Dr Joanne Liu recently returned from touring treatment facilities MSF is operating in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, which are engulfed in the worst EVD outbreak on record. ... It is ... indicative of how dire conditions are in West Africa that Liu called on governments to deploy [military] expertise on Tue [3 Sep 2014] when she addressed a special EVD briefing for the United Nations.

***Without this help, Liu said, this outbreak will not stop. [ProMED emphasis]

"To curb the epidemic, it is imperative that states immediately deploy civilian and military assets with expertise in biohazard containment," she told the UN. "I call upon you to dispatch your disaster response teams, backed by the full weight of your logistical capabilities. ... Without this deployment, we will never get the epidemic under control."

Desperate times call for desperate measures. "This just tells you the extraordinary scale of this outbreak on the ground," says Dr Ross Upshur, an ethicist and global health expert who teaches at the University of Toronto's Dalla Lana School of Public Health. "If MSF is willing to countenance assistance from military sources with the provisos they've already put in place, that just tells you how serious the situation is on the ground."

***The caveats Liu laid out were that any military assets and personnel deployed to the EVD zone should not be used for quarantine, containment, or crowd control measures. [ProMED emphasis]

Michael Osterholm, head of the Center for Infectious Diseases Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, applauded the MSF call, saying the military expertise with logistics, supply chains, transportation of goods and personnel are needed in this situation. "MSF continues to provide the most honest, blunt and informed assessment of where we're at, not just in terms of how bad it is, but what do we actually really need to do to contain it," Osterholm says.

Should Canada deploy DART, its Disaster Assistance Response Team, which is often sent in response to natural disasters abroad? As of late last week, sources suggested a DART deployment was not being considered. And late Tue [2 Sep 2014], the government suggested it hadn't been asked for this type of help, "at least not by countries battling EVD. Canada has not received a request from affected countries to send in the Disaster Assistance Response Team," department spokeswoman Beatrice Fenelon said via email. Stephen Cornish, executive director of MSF Canada, says the organization had been in ongoing discussions with the Canadian government about assistance it could offer. It and others must step up their efforts, he insists.

***And that means countries that have medically staffed field hospitals with isolation units should send them to West Africa. [ProMED emphasis]

The EVD outbreak needs a stronger response than UN and non-governmental organizations are able to provide, Cornish says. "It needs the response of states to have such independent capacities, and it needs their buy-in, their action, as well as the WHO's overall vision in order to co-ordinate this across West Africa. And we're really not seeing that," he says. MSF has been calling for assistance for some time. The treatment facilities it has opened have been overwhelmed, treating far more patients than they have beds. The organization has said it can't staff more facilities and has asked others to step into the breach. So far it is still waiting.

Few countries have offered assistance, and those that have, like Canada, are providing support services such as running diagnostic labs. Useful, welcome, but not enough, Cornish says. "We don't only need diagnostics, and we don't only need education."

***"We need increased bed capacity now. We're turning away patients who are sick because they're not sick enough, because the wards are overflowing with patients," he says. [ProMED emphasis]

In some MSF treatment centres, medical personnel are no longer able to provide intravenous medication and can only offer palliative care. "This is far from enough," Cornish says. "It's unjust to those who are sick; it's unfair to the medical personal that we're putting on the front line, and it will be completely ineffective in getting ahead of this epidemic."

The World Health Organization says there have been at least 3070 cases of EVD in this outbreak and 1552 deaths. Those figures exceed all previous known Ebola cases and deaths combined.

[4] USA: Military help premature

A senior US official rebutted a call from medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) for wealthy nations to deploy specialized biological disaster response teams to the region. MSF on Tue [2 Sep 2014] had warned that 800 more beds for EVD patients were urgently needed in the Liberian capital Monrovia alone.

"I don't think at this point deploying biological incident response teams is exactly what's needed," said Gayle Smith, special assistant to the president and senior director for development and democracy on the National Security Council. She said the US government was focusing efforts on rapidly increasing the number of EVD treatment centers in affected countries, providing protective equipment and ensuring local staff received training.

"We will see a considerable ramp-up in the coming days and weeks. If we find it is still moving out of control, we will look at other options," Smith told a conference call.

[5] Vaccine trial UK
Date: 3 Sep 2014
Source: IFL Science [edited]
http://theconversation.com/why-we-need-volunteers-for-the-first-human-ebola-trials-31158


... At the Jenner Institute in Oxford [UK], we will run the 1st phase I trial of a vaccine targeted at the Zaire strain of ebolavirus that is causing the current outbreak. The main purpose of this 1st-in-humans trial in the UK is to establish a detailed safety profile of the vaccine and assess the type of immune responses it induces before it could be considered for widespread use. A further goal is to identify the most suitable dose of the vaccine. The vaccine is being co-developed with GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) and the US National Institutes of Health, who are running parallel human phase I trials in the USA. Our trial is being funded with a GBP 2.8 million [USD 4.6 million] grant from the Wellcome Trust, the Medical Research Council, and the UK Department for International Development.

The candidate vaccine in question uses a chimpanzee adenovirus (a type of respiratory virus) as a means to expose or prime the immune systems of volunteers to a specific protein that exists on the surface of the ebolavirus. The vaccine contains some genetic material but not the entire ebolavirus genome so it cannot cause an EVD infection. As with the US trial, the adenovirus also will not replicate but instead prompts the person vaccinated to express an ebolavirus vaccine that the immune system will later recognise if the person became infected.

Previously, it has been tested in animal models and has demonstrated impressive effectiveness at protecting against infection and promoting recovery from animals later exposed to ebolavirus. Just a single dose was required to induce very high levels of protective efficacy. Chimpanzee adenoviruses have been used extensively in clinical trials for malaria, hepatitis C and other infections, but no vaccine of this type has been licensed as yet. In the 25 clinical trials of chimpanzee adenoviruses that have taken place, the safety profile of this type of vaccine has been good.

At present, ethical and regulatory approvals are being prioritised so that the trials may begin in the UK in September 2014. This will be run in parallel with a cohort in the USA and extended to The Gambia and Mali thereafter, subject to agreements on ethical and clinical protocols. At the same time, 10 000 vaccine doses will be stockpiled by GSK in order that, should the vaccine meet safety requirements, it may be deployed without any further delays.

The candidate vaccine will be tested in 60 healthy volunteers over the age of 18 who we will shortly begin recruiting. During the trial, volunteers will be administered a single dose of the vaccine into the muscles of the upper arm, and blood samples will be taken at specific time points. In all, volunteers will be expected to attend for a total of 9 clinic visits over 6 months. Clinical trials are an essential part of the vaccine development process and invaluable tools when it comes to understanding and ultimately improving the processes that provide vaccine-mediated protection from disease. In order to gain the upper hand over EVD, we need all the help we can get.

[***MSF says it can't staff more facilities and has asked others to step into the breach. So far it is still waiting. "We need increased bed capacity NOW. We're turning away patients who are sick because they're not sick enough, because the wards are overflowing with patients." With the latest spread in Nigeria, it looks as though any delay in aid may come too late. Volunteers need at least 3 weeks preparation before deployment for vaccinations against tropical diseases to take effect and for orientation and briefing.

TO VOLUNTEER, go to: http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/work-us/work-field/applying-msf and see [5] EVD information for volunteers in http://www.promedmail.org/direct.php?id=2725060.

***Daniel Lucey MD MPH, Connaught volunteer, says: "Persons cured of EVD are underappreciated. Many persons have been cured: some could help care for the ill." This is a very important observation. He also says: "[There is need for] more testing and isolation centres, and they need more beds NOW. There are ZERO treatment centres in Freetown." - Mod.JW
