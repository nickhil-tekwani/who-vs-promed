An unidentified virus is attacking tomato crops in large parts of Maharashtra. In the districts of Ahmednagar, Pune, and Nashik, about 60% of the crop has been decimated in the last 10 days. Plant experts have expressed multiple opinions about the outbreak.

The Mahatma Phule Krishi Vidyapeeth [MPKV] agriculture university are studying the outbreak along with state government officials. A MPKV scientist said an analysis of the tomato samples is underway, but conclusions have not been reached. Due to the lockdown, samples have not reached national laboratories for further analysis.

Farmers are now pointing fingers at seed companies for allegedly selling diseased seeds. The damage to the crop has been extensive. Leaves are drying up, and the ripened tomatoes are developing irregular shapes and losing their sap. The crop ready for harvesting has been lost to the viral outbreak. Farmers fear if this viral attack is not controlled, it could spread to other crops. They also want advice on precautionary steps before replanting so that crops are not affected all over again.

[A number of tomato diseases and pathogens have been reported from the region, many of which can also affect potatoes and other solanaceous crops. Although a virus is claimed as causing the problem, it is not clear what reasoning this is based on since no evidence is being supplied. Symptoms similar to what is described above may be due to a number of pathogens of tomatoes.

A time frame of a crop being destroyed within 10 days, as stated, appears extremely short for most virus diseases, but can be observed more frequently for fungal or bacterial diseases. For example, late blight of tomato and potato (caused by the fungus-like organism _Phytophthora infestans_) is rife in the region, with a severe strain spreading there (ProMED-mail post 20180418.5755980). It is not clear whether this disease has been excluded as a possibility.

The problems above may also be due to a combination of pathogens and/or other factors. Any speculative "experts' opinions," as mentioned above, will not provide a solution, but factual information is required instead. Disease management will need to be based on reliable molecular diagnosis of any pathogen(s) involved.
