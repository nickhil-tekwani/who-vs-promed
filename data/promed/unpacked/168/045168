Ulster confirms _Dickeya_ outbreak
----------------------------------
_Dickeya _solani_, the bacterium that causes an aggressive form of
'blackleg' disease in potato crops, has been found in a batch of seed
potatoes imported into Northern Ireland from the Netherlands. Ulster
agriculture minister Michelle O'Neill confirmed the finding of the
pathogen.

Last year [2010], following the detection of _Dickeya_ in a local
ware potato crop grown from imported seed [ProMED-mail post 20101112.4106], DARD [Northern Ireland Department of Agriculture and
Rural Development] implemented a policy of testing all high risk
imported stocks of seed potatoes for the disease.

This caution, said Ms O'Neill, had paid off with the early detection
of this new disease incursion. "Following a meeting with the importer
and growers we have ordered the immediate destruction of the infected
crops and subsequent restrictions on the use of the land for potato
production.

"I would remind growers, merchants, and seed importers that they
should carefully consider the risks of introducing seed from areas
known to have _Dickeya solani_," she added. "The continued freedom of
the local industry from this damaging bacterial pathogen will maintain
the competitiveness of our ware and seed industry."

[Blackleg caused by _Pectobacterium carotovorum_ subsp.
_atrosepticum_ can cause severe losses in potato crops. However, an
even more virulent form of blackleg emerged in recent years as a major
threat spreading in Europe and Israel. The cause has been identified
as a new bacterial species in 2009 (ProMED-mail post 20091207.4162),
currently referred to as _Dickeya solani_. Symptoms resemble
"traditional" blackleg and include wilting of plants and tuber rot,
but the disease appears to be more aggressive and causes damage under
a wider range of conditions and at lower bacterial loadings.
Preliminary results from Europe indicate that the new species will
rapidly take over as the principal cause of blackleg-like symptoms in
potato crops.

The bacterium is spread with contaminated plant or other material
(including seed tubers), by mechanical means, and water. Disease
management includes seed tuber handling and cultural techniques, use
of clean planting material, and phytosanitation to prevent
introduction of the pathogen from external sources. Low levels of seed
tuber infection pose a major risk of pathogen spread and appear to
have been the cause for previous outbreaks in Scotland (ProMED-mail
posts 20100705.2229 & 20100528.1775), despite quarantine measures,
certification schemes, and an alert issued to regional growers
(ProMED-mail post 20100208.0421). In the case reported above, the
testing scheme appears to have been effective in Northern Ireland.

_Dickeya_ species (as well as _Pectobacterium carotovorum_
subspecies) also cause bacterial soft rot of potato. They can also
affect other crops, causing, for example, a foot rot disease in rice
as well as stem and root rot of sweet potato.
