Plateau [state] has recorded some suspected cases of cerebro-spinal meningitis in Langtang South and Mikang Local Government Areas, Dr. Kunden Deyin, the state Commissioner for Health, disclosed to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Friday [31 Mar 2017] in Jos.

Deyin said that findings from the suspected cases were consistent with cerebra-spinal meningitis, clinically. He said that the national policy on meningitis now stipulates that before any case is confirmed as being that of meningitis, a blood sample or cerebra-spinal fluid must have been diagnosed at a government approved medical laboratory. It is the results from such a laboratory that will confirm the case as being that of cerebra-spinal meningitis, he said.

The commissioner said that those persons suspected to be suffering from the disease had commenced treatment with antibiotics.

[2] More states, Vaccine Shortage

The Center for Disease Control and Prevention said 282 people have died since Nigeria was struck with a meningitis outbreak. The agency reported a wide outbreak of cerebrospinal meningitis across 15 states.

A new strain of the disease called "stereotype C" has emerged, and there are not enough vaccines against it, the Center for Disease Control warned.

"There is a vaccine available," Chief Executive Chikwe Ihekweazu said, "but it is not commercially available for the stereotype involved in this specific outbreak, and we have to make application to the World Health Organization for the vaccines."

Nearly 2000 suspected cases have been recorded, and 109 have been treated since the outbreak began in February 2017.

An emergency response team has been sent to the 5 states in the northwest of the country.

As one of the 26 countries in the African "meningitis belt," Nigeria records some of the highest incidences of the disease on the continent. The outbreaks peak in the dry season in certain states due to the low humidity and dusty conditions and usually end as the rainy season approaches, Ihekweazu added.

"Meningitis is a tough disease, especially during this period, and it is associated with overcrowding; understanding the living conditions in the country, people must keep their building ventilated," he said. According to the WHO, even when the disease is diagnosed early, and adequate treatment begins, 5 percent to 10 percent of patients die, typically within 24 to 48 hours of the onset of symptoms.

Some common symptoms are stiff neck, high fever, sensitivity to light, confusion, headaches and vomiting.

Local and international organizations are working together to manage the epidemic. "We believe that our concerted efforts will bring this outbreak under control, as we also work towards preventing outbreaks of this scale in the future," the Center for Disease Control stated.

[Prior ProMED-mail posts reported that a _Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroup C outbreak is occurring in the northwestern states of Nigeria, with Katsina, Sokoto and Zamfara accounting for almost 90 percent of cases (see "see also" section below). According to the 2nd news report above, the outbreak may be spreading, with 10 more Nigerian states involved than initially reported.

The 1st news report above says that cases of suspected meningitis are also occurring in Plateau state, which is located in approximately the center of the country; its capital is Jos (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plateau_State). However, we are not told the number of cases in Plateau state, if any have been confirmed to be meningococcal meningitis, and, if so, what the serogroups are. More information in this regard would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources.
