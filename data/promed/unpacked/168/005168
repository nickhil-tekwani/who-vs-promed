[The above report does not mention the possible exposure source in this case.

It is important that the epidemiology of zoonotic diseases such as CCHF are better understood at the national and regional/provincial levels, given the large number of livestock in the country, and its importance to the economy and livelihood of rural communities. Furthermore, hospital staff should be educated to consider CCHF as a possible disease agent, since they are at high risk of contracting the disease, especially in hospitals with limited resources. - Mod.UBA
