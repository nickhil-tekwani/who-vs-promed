[Peste des petits ruminants or PPR is a significant disease of small ruminants and camels which has emerged steadily from the area of its first description in the 1940s in Cote d'Ivoire to the rest of West Africa, then to Sudan and India by the middle 1980s. It finally became widespread throughout the Middle East and Asia as well as tropical Africa.

This disease has a significant impact through high animal mortalities, loss of production, and deprivation of households of a ready source of needed cash in an emergency. PPR is a subject of a potential eradication program because of the parallels in agent between PPR and rinderpest which can be controlled by vaccine.

For more information see FAO EMPRES (Emergency Prevention System for transboundary animal and plant pests and diseases) reports at http://www.fao.org/ag/againfo/resources/documents/AH/PPR_flyer.pdf, which provides an overview of the problem and the prospects for eradication. - Mod.PC]
