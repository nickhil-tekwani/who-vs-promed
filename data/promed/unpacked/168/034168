-------------------------------------------------------------
A growing contribution of Nigeria and Pakistan to the global incidence
of poliomyelitis reflects decreasing incidence in India, rather than
an absolute increase in Nigeria and Pakistan. [1-4] See graphs:
http://www.gideononline.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/Polio-India.png
and

These trends clearly illustrate the relative success of mass
vaccination, as illustrated in the following 2 graphs*:

and

Health care workers in Nigeria and Pakistan may find the last 2 graphs
useful in convincing citizens who hesitate to vaccinate their
children.

[ProMED-mail would like to thank Dr Berger for his continued
contributions and sharing of the GIDEON database with the ProMED-mail
subscribers. Dr Berger is correct when he points out that the
increased proportion of cases in Nigeria and Pakistan reflect a
decrease in cases in India. - Mod.MPP]
