[In ProMED-mail's posting "Tuberculosis, elephants - Nepal (02)
20070620.1990," we included a query received from Richard I. Frankel,
M.D., M.P.H., F.A.C.P., Emeritus Professor of Medicine, University of
Hawaii: "It would be useful to know what is meant by the statement
"the elephants have tested positive for TB..." Are these elephants
ill, and was that the reason for testing? Were they tested by skin
test or by some other means? Do they have latent infection or
tuberculosis disease?"
The following firsthand response has been received from Dr Susan Mikota]:

In January 2006, a study was conducted by Dr. Kamal Giri in
fulfillment of his MvSc. degree at the Institute of Agriculture and
Animal Science. Dr. Giri's work was assisted by Elephant Care
International and Tufts Center for Conservation Medicine. TB has been
observed postmortem and anecdotally reported in Nepal, India, and
other Asian countries. This was the 1st comprehensive evaluation of
range country elephants for TB.
In addition to collecting trunk wash samples (which were cultured at
the National Tuberculosis Lab in Nepal and the National Veterinary
Services Lab in the U.S.), we collected blood for several serological
TB assays: (ELISA, Elephant TB STAT-PAK, multi-antigen print
immunoassay (MAPIA), and immunoblot, as well as for CBCs, serum
chemistries, and an immune profile. The determination of which
elephants were positive or considered to be at risk to develop active
TB was made by evaluating all of the data with particular attention
given to the ELISA, Elephant TB STAT-PAK and MAPIA tests, which we
have found to be useful to diagnose TB among elephants in the U.S. A
full report was given to the government of Nepal.
We do not use skin testing in elephants because it is not accurate
(see Lewerin, S.S. et al, 2005. Outbreak of _Mycobacterium
tuberculosis_ infection among captive Asian elephants in a Swedish
zoo. Vet Rec. 156(6):171-175 and also Mikota, S.K. et al, 2001.
Epidemiology & Diagnosis of _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ in captive
Asian elephants (_Elephas maximus_). Journal of Zoo and Wildlife
Medicine 32(1):1-16).
Elephants that are culture positive clearly have active TB. We don't
really know whether elephants develop latent disease or whether we
simply fail to detect active disease because of the limitations of
our diagnostic techniques. We cannot X-ray adult elephants.
Culture has inherent limitations as a primary diagnostic technique.
Failure to isolate the organism does not rule out infection.
Reporting time is slow (up to 8 weeks) because pathogenic
mycobacteria may grow slowly. The trunk wash method of sample
collection results in variable sample quality. Overgrowth due to
contamination from trunk wash samples occurs and may compromise the
reliability of culture results, especially if overgrowth is not
reported.
Obtaining 3 samples may not be practical or affordable for screening
large numbers of elephants in Asia, where surveillance is urgently
needed.
Serological tests that have been under investigation in the U.S. have
shown great promise for improving our ability to diagnose TB in
elephants.
The Elephant TB STAT-PAK is a lateral-flow assay that incorporates a
unique cocktail of mycobacterial antigens impregnated on a
nitrocellulose membrane and placed in a plastic cassette similar to a
pregnancy test kit. Serum, plasma, or whole blood may be used and
results are available in 20 minutes (see Lyashchenko, K.P. et al,
2006. Tuberculosis in elephants: antibody responses to defined
antigens of _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_, potential for early
diagnosis, and monitoring of treatment. Clin Vaccine Immunol
13(7):722-732, and Lyashchenko, K. et al, 2005. Application of MAPIA
(Multiple antigen print immunoassay) and rapid lateral flow
technology for tuberculosis testing of elephants. 2005 Proceedings
AAZV, AAWV, AZA Nutrition Advisory Group, pp. 64-65).
The MAPIA is a laboratory procedure for antibody detection that uses
a panel of multiple purified and recombinant antigens of _M.
tuberculosis_ and _M. bovis_ that are separately applied to a
nitrocellulose membrane using an automated printing device (see
Lyashchenko, K. et al., 2000. Multi-antigen print immunoassay for the
development of serological diagnosis of infectious disease. Journal
of Immunological Methods 242:91-100).
Excluding the data from Nepal, approximately 99 Asian and 72 African
elephants in Europe, Australia, South Africa, and the U.S. have been
tested using the Elephant TB STAT-PAK and MAPIA, including 22
elephants with culture-confirmed TB. Preliminary data has
demonstrated 100 percent sensitivity and 97 percent specificity for
the Elephant TB STAT-PAK and 100 percent sensitivity and 100 percent
specificity for the MAPIA using culture as the reference standard.
The TB STAT-PAK has recently completed government licensing
procedures in the U.S. and will likely be commercially available
later this year [2007].
If the Elephant TB STAT-PAK is used as a screening test and the MAPIA
is sequentially applied as a confirmatory assay, the accuracy of this
testing algorithm is 100 percent. Seroconversion on Elephant TB
STAT-PAK and MAPIA has been noted in several elephants months to
years prior to a positive culture (Lyashchenko 2006). In one elephant
that was euthanized and determined to be TB positive, retrospective
evaluation of serum indicated seroconversion 8 years [earlier].
A study by Dr. Scott Larsen (U.C. Davis) and Dr. Mo Salman (U. of
Colorado) using a 6-antigen ELISA demonstrated an estimated
sensitivity of 100 percent and specificity of 100 percent, on a
sample size of 47 Asian and African elephants (7 culture positive)
(see Larsen, R.S., et al. 2000. Evaluation of a multiple-antigen
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for detection of _Mycobacterium
tuberculosis_ infection in captive elephants. Journal of Zoo and
Wildlife Medicine 31(3): 291-302).
The ELISA continues to be evaluated but is not available commercially.
An important advantage of TB serodiagnosis compared to trunk wash
culture is that, once established, the antibody response remains
sustained throughout infection and disease, while culture may be
intermittently positive or negative in infected elephants. A decline
in specific antibodies to certain antigens in MAPIA has been observed
in 7 culture positive elephants tested to date that had undergone
treatment, suggesting that this technology may also be a useful for
monitoring response to therapy.
Regarding clinical signs: in most cases, elephants have not shown
clinical signs until the disease is well advanced. Elephants are
susceptible to both _M.tuberculosis_ and _M.bovis_.
While most cases in the U.S. have been due to _M. tb_, we may find
more cases of _M. bovis_ in Asia, where elephants often share grazing
land with domestic livestock.
A brief history of elephant TB and a further description of
serological tests can be found in the summary document of a 2005
elephant TB research meeting (Summary - Elephant Tuberculosis
Research Workshop May 2005, available at
<http://www.elephantcare.org/protodoc_files/2005/Elephant%20Tuberculosis%20Research%20Workshop%20May%2005.pdf>).
