FDA-Approves Human Vaccine for Avian Influenza
----------------------------------------------
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) yesterday [Tue 17 Apr
2007] approved a human vaccine against the H5N1 influenza virus,
marking the first such approval in the U.S. In a press release the
agency said that, should H5N1 develop the ability to spread readily
from person to person: "The vaccine may provide early limited
protection in the months before a vaccine tailored to the pandemic
strain of the virus could be developed and produced." The vaccine
will be kept in a federal stockpile and available only through public
health officials; it is approved for those 18 to 64 who are at
increased risk for H5N1 exposure.
Here follows the text of the FDA Press Release:
-------------------------
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) today announced the first
approval in the United States of a vaccine for humans against the
H5N1 influenza virus, commonly known as avian or bird flu.
The vaccine could be used in the event the current H5N1 avian virus
were to develop the capability to efficiently spread from human to
human, resulting in the rapid spread of the disease across the globe.
Should such an influenza pandemic emerge, the vaccine may provide
early limited protection in the months before a vaccine tailored to
the pandemic strain of the virus could be developed and produced.
"The threat of an influenza pandemic is, at present, one of the most
significant public health issues our nation and world faces," said
Andrew C. von Eschenbach, M.D., Commissioner of Food and Drugs. "The
approval of this vaccine is an important step forward in our
protection against a pandemic."
The H5N1 virus is one version of the influenza A virus commonly found
in birds. Unlike seasonal influenza, where infection ranges from mild
to serious symptoms in most people, the disease caused by H5N1 is far
more severe and happens quickly, with pneumonia and multi-organ
failure commonly seen.
While there have been no reported human cases of H5N1 infection in
the United States, almost 300 people worldwide have been infected
with this virus since 2003 and more than half of them have died. To
date, H5N1 influenza has remained primarily an animal disease but
should the virus acquire the ability for sustained transmission among
humans, people will have little immunity to this virus and the
potential for an influenza pandemic would have grave consequences for
global public health.
"The timing and severity of an influenza pandemic is uncertain, but
the danger remains very real," said Jesse L. Goodman, M.D., M.P.H.,
Director of FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. "We
are working closely with other government agencies, global partners
and the vaccine industry to facilitate the development, licensure and
availability of needed supplies of safe and effective vaccines to
protect against the pandemic threat."
The vaccine was obtained from a human strain and is intended for
immunizing people 18 through 64 years of age who could be at
increased risk of exposure to the H5N1 influenza virus contained in
the vaccine. H5N1 influenza vaccine immunization consists of two
intramuscular injections, given approximately one month apart. The
manufacturer, sanofi pasteur Inc., will not sell the vaccine
commercially. Instead, the vaccine has been purchased by the federal
government for inclusion within the U.S. Strategic National Stockpile
for distribution by public health officials if needed. The vaccine
will be manufactured at sanofi pasteur's Swiftwater, Pa., facility.
A clinical study was conducted to collect safety information and
information on recipient's immune responses and to determine the
appropriate vaccine dose. A total of 103 healthy adults received a 90
microgram dose of the vaccine by injection followed by another 90
microgram dose 28 days later. In addition, there were approximately
300 healthy adults who received the vaccine at doses lower than 90
micrograms and a total of 48 who received a placebo injection.
The vaccine was generally well tolerated, with the most common side
effects reported as pain at the injection site, headache, general ill
feeling and muscle pain. The study showed that 45 percent of
individuals who received the 90 microgram, two-dose regimen developed
antibodies at a level that is expected to reduce the risk of getting
influenza. Although the level of antibodies seen in the remaining
individuals did not reach that level, current scientific information
on other influenza vaccines suggests that less than optimal antibody
levels may still have the potential to help reduce disease severity
and influenza-related hospitalizations and deaths. Additional
information on this H5N1 influenza vaccine is being collected on
safety and effectiveness in other age groups and will be available to
the FDA in the near future.
With the support of the FDA, the U.S. National Institutes of Health
and other government agencies, sanofi pasteur and other manufacturers
are working to develop a next generation of influenza vaccines for
enhanced immune responses at lower doses, using technologies intended
to boost the immune response. Meanwhile, the approval and
availability of this vaccine will enhance national readiness and the
nation's ability to protect those at increased risk of exposure.
The U.S. Strategic National Stockpile is maintained by the U.S.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It contains large
quantities of medicine and medical supplies to protect the American
public if there is a public health emergency, which can be delivered
to any state in the United States within 12 hours. For more

The FDA has announced the licensure of the first vaccine in the
United States for humans against the H5N1 influenza virus. This
vaccine is an inactivated influenza virus suitable for immunization
of persons 18 through 64 years of age who are at increased risk of
exposure to the H5N1 influenza virus subtype contained in the
vaccine. The vaccine is derived from the a/vietnam/1203/2004
influenza virus and is manufactured by sanofi pasteur, Inc., of
Swiftwater, PA. It has been purchased by the federal government for
inclusion within the nation's strategic national stockpile. The
vaccine is a thimerosal-containing inactivated preparation.
One multi-center, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled,
dose-ranging study in healthy adults, 18 to 64 years of age,
investigated the safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine. A total of
103 healthy adults received a 90 microgram dose of the vaccine by
injection, followed by another 90 microgram dose 28 days later. In
addition, there were approximately another 300 healthy adults who
received the vaccine at doses lower than 90 micrograms and a total of
48 who received placebo by injection. Of the various doses tested,
the study showed that the 90 microgram dose had the better immune
response, meaning that at this particular dose, the vaccine induced
the most antibodies in the blood against the H5N1 influenza virus
strain. The 90 microgram two-dose regimen produced levels of
antibodies expected to reduce the risk of getting H5N1 influenza in
45 percent of those who received it. Although the remaining
individuals did not develop this level of antibody, current
scientific information on other influenza vaccines suggests that less
than optimal antibody levels may still have the potential to help
reduce disease severity and influenza-related hospitalizations and deaths.
These data suggest that the vaccine is safe and induces a
satisfactory but low level specific immune response. This vaccine
will not be available to the public commercially. It has been
purchased by the federal government for inclusion within the
country's strategic national stockpile, for distribution in case it
is ever needed. Other vaccines are also being developed to meet the
nation's needs against influenza pandemics. - Mod.CP]
