[1
Outbreak of legionnaires disease among British tourists associated with
Rhine cruise
Six cases in British tourists have been linked to a single ship that was
used exclusively by one British tour company for cruises on the Rhine. The
first case occurred in July, the second in August, two cases became ill in
September, and two in October. Four cases are men, two women (age range 72
to 78 years). None has died. One case with onset of illness in October was
admitted to hospital in Germany.
The season for this particular cruise has now ended. The last cruise
sailed from 24 September to 8 October with 85 passengers on board. The
tour operator has contacted passengers to inform them of the outbreak and
advise them to seek medical advice if they develop a respiratory illness.
The ship is Dutch owned and is being investigated by Dutch health
authorities. There are no reports of illness among members of the crew.
The European Working Group on Legionella (EWGLI) collaborators in Germany
and the Netherlands are working closely with EWGLIs coordinators in London
to measure the extent of the outbreak and
identify the source of infection.

[2
Outbreak of legionnaires disease among European tourists [who visited
Portugal
Five cases have been associated with an apartment hotel in Albufeira,
Portugal. The cases, one reported from the Netherlands, two from Scotland,
and two from England, became ill in May, July, August , and October. Three
cases are men, two women (age range from 30 to 67 years). No deaths have
been reported.
The EWGLI collaborator and the Ministry of Health in Portugal and the UK
Federation of Tour Operators have all been informed. Investigations
carried out by local health authorities in Portugal on the hotels air
conditioning and water systems are reported to be negative for _Legionella_.
