Scotland: 3rd incident investigated
Ireland: fraud claims investigated
------------------------------------
A third suspected case of Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) is being
investigated in Scotland. A "possible case" of the infection is being
investigated by the State Veterinary Service at a farm in the Falkirk local
authority area, said the Scottish Executive.
The farm is believed to be in the area of Bo'ness where, rural development
minister Ross Finnie told MSPs yesterday, investigators were called out.
Results from the 2 other suspected cases in Scotland - at Lockerbie and
Canonbie - are expected later today. And there was little sign of optimism
in any quarter those 2 tests would prove negative. Scottish NFU regional
chairman William MacIntyre said "We are preparing for the worst."

Britain and Ireland struggled Thursday to contain an outbreak of FMD, and
the first cases in Scotland were confirmed at farms near Lockerbie.
Scotland confirmed its first cases on a farm in Lockerbie and another in
nearby Canonbie. Cattle from the farms will be slaughtered, the Scottish
Executive said. The cases were linked to shipments from Britain before it
halted livestock movement, chief veterinary officer Jim Scudamore said.
