Egypt woman critically ill with bird flu
----------------------------------------
A 33-year-old woman has contracted bird flu, the 64th recorded case
since the 1st outbreak of the disease in Egypt in 2006, the health
ministry announced on Wednesday [15 Apr 2009]. The woman from the
Kafr el-Sheikh province of northern Egypt is in critical condition
and on an artificial respirator, state-run news agency MENA quoted a
health ministry official as saying. She 1st showed symptoms of flu
more than a week ago after being exposed to dead fowl thought to have
been carrying the disease, the official said.

Egypt has seen an increase in bird flu cases over the past month. The
World Health Organisation (WHO) called last month [March 2009] for an
investigation into why many of the victims have been young children.
A total of 23 people have died of bird flu in Egypt. Most of the
victims have been young girls or women, who are generally in charge
of looking after poultry in rural areas.

Egypt hosted an international conference on bird flu in October
[2008], when Washington pledged an additional 320 million dollars to
the fight against the disease amid fears it may yet escalate into a
global pandemic. The H5N1 strain of the virus that is most dangerous
to humans 1st emerged in Asia in 2003 and has since caused nearly 250
deaths, according to WHO figures. Scientists fear that a mutation of
the bird flu virus resulting in a strain easily transmitted among
humans could create a pandemic, potentially affecting up to one-fifth
of the world's population.

Egyptian woman contracts bird flu
---------------------------------
A 33-year-old Egyptian woman has contracted the highly pathogenic
bird flu virus, the 4th case this month [April 2009], Egyptian state
news agency MENA said Wednesday [15 Apr 2009]. MENA said the woman
came from the northern province of Kafr el-Sheikh. Her case brings to
64 the number of confirmed cases of the H5N1 avian flu virus in
Egypt, which has been hit harder by bird flu than any other country
outside Asia. Health Ministry spokesman Abdel Rahman Shahine said the
woman had started to show symptoms on 7 Apr 2009 after coming into
contact with dead birds.

While H5N1 rarely infects people, experts say they fear it could
mutate into a form that people could easily pass to one another,
sparking a pandemic that could kill millions. Since 2003 the H5N1
avian influenza virus has infected at least 411 people in 15
countries and killed 254. It has killed or forced the culling of more
than 300 million birds in 61 countries in Asia, the Middle East,
Africa and Europe.

Some 23 Egyptians have died after contracting the virus. Most came
into contact with infected domestic birds in a country where roughly
5 million households depend on domestically raised poultry as a
significant source of food and income. The World Health Organization
has said that it was concerned some Egyptians may carry the bird flu
virus without showing symptoms, which could give it more of a chance
to mutate to a strain that spreads easily among humans.
