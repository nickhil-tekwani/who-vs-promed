5 new cases of OJ disease
------------------
Department of Agriculture tests have found 5 more properties in WA [Western
Australia] with Ovine Johnes Disease, (OJ, or OJD) bringing the number of
properties with positive test results to 16. The properties are in the
shires of Plantagenet, Wagin, West Arthur and Williams.
Department Animal Health manager Ashley Mercy said the results confirmed
the assessment by Department veterinary staff that the disease was
established in WA. He said more WA properties were likely to have the disease.
Dr Mercy said that OJD was in insidious disease and it could take years
before signs could be seen in a flock.
"OJD causes production losses, and farmers should take measures to reduce
the risk of their flock becoming infected with OJD. However, if flocks
become infected, owners can economically manage the disease," he said.
"The cost of OJD in lost production is similar to the losses from
lice. OJD in a flock can be managed through management strategies that may
include vaccination. The important issue for the vast majority of WA farms
that are not affected is to take practical biosecurity measures. Farmers
need to take steps to reduce the risk of introducing OJD onto the farm in
purchased, introduced or stray sheep."
Producers whose flocks are not known to be infected are urged to seek
advice from their veterinary adviser on the most appropriate biosecurity
protocols for their flock. Owners infected flocks are urged to seed advice
from their veterinary adviser.
They should also contact their farm management adviser on the most economic
response to the disease for their individual business.
Dr Mercy said the Department of Agriculture would continue to work with
industry in promoting information about OJD in WA. He said it was
important for producers, farm advisers and stock agents to consider the
sorts of issues that needed to be factored in when developing guidelines
for flocks known or suspected to have OJD.
