A virus afflicting horses and can spread to humans and prove fatal, has been detected in a horse in Clare County, located in the northern Lower Peninsula.

The Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (MDARD) on Tuesday [11 Aug 2020], announced by state veterinarian Dr Nora Wineland who confirmed 2020's 1st case [in Michigan] of eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) in a 2-year-old filly from Clare County. Both horse owners and Michigan residents are urged to take precautions.

EEE is a viral disease transmitted by mosquitoes to both animals and people, MDARD states.

"EEE is one of the most dangerous mosquito-borne diseases in the US, with a 90-percent fatality rate among horses becoming ill and a 33-percent fatality rate among humans who become ill," MDARD stated.

In 2019, Michigan saw 50 EEE cases in animals and a record of 10 in humans, including 6 human fatalities. The virus is typically seen in late summer to early fall each year in Michigan.

People can be infected with EEE from the bite of a mosquito carrying the virus, but it is not spread by horse-to-horse or horse-to-human contact. In humans, signs of EEE include the sudden onset of fever, chills, and body and joint aches.

EEE infection can develop into severe encephalitis, resulting in headache, disorientation, tremors, seizures, and paralysis. Permanent brain damage, coma, and death may also occur in some cases.

"In 2019, Michigan experienced the worst outbreak of EEE ever documented in the state, with 10 human cases -- including 6 deaths and 50 cases in animals from 20 counties," said Dr Joneigh Khaldun, chief medical executive and chief deputy director for health for the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services. "Michiganders are strongly urged to take precautions to protect themselves from mosquito bites. It only takes one bite from a mosquito to transmit the virus, which can lead to severe neurologic illness, permanent disability, and sometimes death."

The horse in Clare County had not been vaccinated against EEE. It developed signs of the illness, such as walking in circles, leaning to the right, and pressing its head against objects. The illness progressed to the point where the horse lay down and could not get back up, Wineland said.

"Horse owners in Michigan should take extra measures to protect their animals," she added.

To protect your animals, measures could include the following:
- talking to a veterinarian about vaccinating horses against EEE [strongly recommended - Mod.TG];
- placing horses in a barn under fans (as mosquitoes are not strong flyers) during peak mosquito activity from dusk to dawn;
- using an insect repellent on the animals approved for the species;
- eliminating standing water on the property -- that is, fill in puddles, repair eaves, and change the water in buckets and bowls at least once a day [empty flower pot reservoirs and get rid of old tires - Mod.TG];
- contacting a veterinarian if a horse shows signs of the illness: mild fever and stumbling, which can progress to being down and struggling to stand.

A mosquito trapped in Connecticut has tested positive for eastern equine encephalitis for the 1st time this season [2020].

The mosquito was trapped at Stonington High School on [ Aug 2020], according to the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station.

Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) can be transmitted to humans through mosquito bites. It is a disease that can cause neurological disease and an infection of the brain, according to the Centers For Disease Control and Prevention. It can be fatal.

The Ledge Light Health District released the following tips to keep safe:

Precautions to avoid mosquito bites:
- be sure door and window screens are tight fitting and in good repair;
- while outdoors for long periods of time, wear shoes, socks, long pants, and long-sleeved shirts; clothing should be light colored and made of tightly woven materials that keep mosquitoes away from the skin;
- use mosquito netting when sleeping outdoors and to protect small babies when outdoors;
- consider the use of mosquito repellents recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), such as ones containing DEET, picaridin, oil of lemon eucalyptus, iIR3535, or 2-undecanone, and apply according to directions, when it is necessary to be outdoors;
- when using DEET, use the lowest concentration effective for the time spent outdoors (for example, 6% lasts approximately 2 hours and 20% for 4 hours) and wash treated skin when returning indoors; do not apply under clothing, to wounds or irritated skin, the hands of children, or to infants less than 2 months;
- minimize time spent outdoors between dusk and dawn when mosquitoes are most active;

Measures to reduce mosquitoes around the home:
- dispose of water-holding containers, such as ceramic pots, used tires, and tire swings, clogged gutters;
- drill holes in the bottom of containers such as those used for recycling;
- change water in bird baths on a weekly basis;
- clean and chlorinate swimming pools, and cover pools when not in use;
- use landscaping to eliminate areas where water can collect on your property;

Officials at the New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets (NYSDAM) have confirmed 2 horses with eastern equine encephalitis (EEE). The 1st, an unvaccinated 10-year-old Belgian gelding from Jefferson County, presented with clinical signs, including rapid right-to-left eye movement, recumbency (down and unable to get up), intermittent seizures, and being unaware of his surroundings, on [1 Aug 2020]. He was subsequently euthanized.

The 2nd, an unvaccinated 3-year-old Belgian filly from St Lawrence County, experienced onset of clinical signs on Aug. 2. Signs included fever, difficulty swallowing, circling, dragging her feet, crossing her feet while walking, leaning, severe ataxia (inability to control bodily movements), and decreased awareness of her surroundings. The horse is reported as deceased.

The Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services [VDACS] confirms a horse stabled in Chesapeake tested positive for eastern equine encephalitis and West Nile virus.

The female quarter horse was euthanized on [7 Aug 2020] after showing severe neurological signs.

No other horses on the farm are showing signs of EEE or WNV.

VDACS encourages horse owners to speak with their veterinarians about vaccinating their horses for EEE and WNV. The mortality rate for WNV is 30 percent and up to 90 percent for EEE.

Vaccinations are effective for 6 to 12 months.

Both EEE and WNV are mosquito-borne illnesses. Typical signs include staggering, circling, depression, loss of appetite, and sometimes fever and blindness. There is no cure for the disease, but it can be prevented through vaccination. Other prevention methods include destroying standing water breeding sites for mosquitoes, use of insect repellents, and removing animals from mosquito-infested areas during peak biting times, usually dusk to dawn. Once a horse has been bitten by an infected mosquito, it may take three to ten days for signs of the disease to appear.

For more information on how to control mosquitoes around horses, visit http://vdacs.virginia.gov/animals-eastern-equine-encephalitis.shtml.

Horse owners may also contact VDACS' Office of Veterinary Services or consult their local veterinarian.

Clemson Livestock and Poultry Health officials have confirmed eastern equine encephalomyelitis (EEE) in the state's 9th horse for 2020. The affected horse, a 5-year-old Tennessee Walking Horse mare from Lexington County, is deceased. This marks Lexington County's 1st Eastern equine encephalitis case for 2020.

Previous EEE cases in South Carolina have occurred in Berkeley, Edgefield, Florence, Horry, and Marion counties. Horry has been hardest hit, with 4 confirmed cases. Other affected counties have had just one confirmed case each.

Eastern equine encephalomyelitis is caused by the eastern equine encephalitis virus, for which wild birds are a natural reservoir. Mosquitoes that feed on EEE-infected birds can transmit the virus to humans, horses, and other birds. Horses do not develop high enough levels of these viruses in their blood to be contagious to other animals or humans. Because of the high mortality rate in horses and humans, EEE is regarded as one of the most serious mosquito-borne diseases in the United States.

Tips for preventing mosquito-borne diseases include:
- avoid mosquito bites: Use insect repellent when outdoors, especially from dusk to dawn;
- look for EPA-labeled products containing active ingredients such as DEET, picaridin (KBR3023), or oil of lemon eucalyptus (p-menthane 3,8-diol);
- apply more repellent, according to label instructions, if mosquitoes start to bite;
- mosquito-proof homes: fix or install window and door screens, and cover or eliminate empty containers with standing water where mosquitoes can lay eggs;
- protect your horses: veterinarians recommend commercially available licensed vaccines against EEE for all horses in the US. Horses should be vaccinated at least annually (recommendations vary in high-risk areas). It's not too late this year [2020] to vaccinate your horses;
- use approved insect repellents to protect horses;
- if possible, put horses in stables, stalls, or barns during the prime mosquito exposure hours of dusk and dawn;
- eliminate standing water, drain water troughs, and empty buckets at least weekly;
- stock water tanks with fish that consume mosquito larvae (contact your local mosquito control for assistance), or use mosquito "dunks" (solid "donuts" of _Bacillus thuringiensis_ israelensis [BTi], which are nontoxic to horses) available at hardware stores.

This is a very busy mosquito season. The article on mosquito trapping (see [2] above] is very important. When counties/states are testing mosquitos, they are looking for what kind of disease season it is likely to be. Horse owners: heed the warning. This is a very busy mosquito season and consequently we see a lot of mosquito borne disease in our horses.

Eastern equine encephalitis is preventable. The vaccine for EEE is usually combined with some other mosquito borne diseases such as West Nile virus (WNV) (mentioned in this update), and western equine encephalitis (WEE). Additionally, these usually have tetanus included. Hence, a lot of protection for the dollars. The vaccine is a series of 2-3 vaccines given 3-4 weeks apart.

EEE wanes the fastest and in areas where the prevalence of the disease is high, horse owners are encouraged to revaccinate approximately every 3-4 months for best protection. - Mod.TG]
