The much-feared disease glanders has been detected among horses, donkeys and mules carrying pilgrims to the holy cave shrine of Mata Vaishno Devi Ji in India, a local newspaper has reported.

Large numbers of working animals are used to ferry the pilgrims from Ban Ganga to Bhawan and back.

The Daily Excelsior, the largest daily newspaper serving the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir, reports that the bacterial disease was 1st confirmed last February [2015] following tests on several horses, mules and donkeys.

The 1st cases were said to be among horses brought in by a contractor from Uttar Pradesh.

The board which administers the shrine took measures to isolate and destroy the infected animals. In all, 1704 blood samples have been taken from animals, with 17 positive for the disease.

The more recent round of testing during August and September [2015], in which 372 blood samples were taken, revealed only one case.

Glanders is a life-threatening, notifiable zoonotic disease which is normally fatal to both animals and humans. It is caused by the bacterium _Burkholderia mallei_.

Due to its high mortality rate and the small number of organisms needed to establish infection, it is regarded as a potential biological warfare or bioterrorism agent.

Signs of glanders include lung lesions and ulceration of mucous membranes in the respiratory tract. The acute form results in coughing and fever, followed by septicaemia and death within days.

In chronic cases, nodules form on the skin and in the nasal passages, eventually ulcerating. Death can result within months, with those surviving acting as carriers.

Concerns have also been raised by shrine authorities over the contamination of drinking water by the dung produced by the thousands of working animals who ply the 13-km track to the shrine from the nearest town.

[The following summary on glanders, an OIE-listed zoonotic disease of equidae, is derived from chapter 2.5.11 of OIE's terrestrial manual, updated 2015:

Glanders is a contagious and fatal disease of horses, donkeys, and mules, caused by infection with the bacterium _Burkholderia mallei_. The pathogen causes nodules and ulcerations in the upper respiratory tract and lungs. A skin form also occurs, known as "farcy." Control of glanders requires testing of suspect clinical cases, screening of apparently normal equids, and elimination of reactors. As _B. mallei_ can be transmitted to humans, all infected or contaminated (or potentially infected or contaminated) material must be handled in a laboratory with appropriate biosafety and biosecurity controls following a biorisk analysis.

Identification of the agent:
Smears from fresh material may reveal Gram-negative nonsporulating, nonencapsulated rods. The presence of a capsule-like cover has been demonstrated by electron microscopy. The bacteria grow aerobically and prefer media that contain glycerol. Unlike the Pseudomonas species and the closely related bacterium _B. pseudomallei_, _B. mallei_ is nonmotile. Commercially available biochemical identification kits lack diagnostic sensitivity. Specific monoclonal antibodies and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as well as real-time PCR assays are available.

Serological tests:
CFT is an accurate and reliable serological method for diagnostic use. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays show promise once their validation is complete. A rose bengal plate agglutination test has been developed. The immunoblot test based on a crude formalin preparation of _B. mallei_ antigens from isolates of different geographical regions is also a sensitive and specific assay. Mallein test: The mallein test is a hypersensitivity test against _B. mallei_. The test is not generally recommended because of animal welfare concerns, however it can be useful in remote endemic areas where sample transport or proper cooling of samples is not possible. Mallein, a water soluble protein fraction of the organism, is injected intradermo-palpebrally. In infected animals, the eyelid swells markedly within 1-2 days.

Requirements for vaccines and diagnostic biologicals:
There are no vaccines. Mallein purified protein derivative is currently available commercially.

According to India's annual reports to the OIE, 2010-2014, the annual number of recorded glanders outbreaks (in equidae) countrywide was the following:
2010 - 1, 2011 - 3, 2012 - 1, 2013 - 1, 2014 - 0.

It is not clear whether among the seropositive animals there were also clinical cases and whether human infections were recorded/suspected. - Mod.AS
