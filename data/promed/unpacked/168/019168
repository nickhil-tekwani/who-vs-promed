[At ProMED-mail we have been searching for an authoritative
explanation as to why the Swedish government forbids the use of
certain vaccines, and specifically for anthrax. The Swedish
vaccination policy is part of their Epizootics Act -- they are not
allowed to treat or vaccinate animals when a disease within the
framework of this Act is suspected. This does not delay sampling and
diagnostics. But of course emergency vaccination can be done with the
permission of the Board of Agriculture (and EU) both for
foot-and-mouth disease and for anthrax (and others). Sweden has always
had a rather skeptical attitude towards many vaccines because the risk
of introducing other unwanted pathogens (bovine viral diarrhea virus,
infectious bovine rhinotracheitis) has been historically known from
other countries' sad experiences. - Mod.MHJ]

I've moved to the university, so I no longer speak for the Swedish
veterinary authorities.

The ban on vaccination in the Swedish legislation is justified by the
fact that these diseases should generally not be present in the
country and any suspicion should be immediately notified to the
authorities and dealt with by them. We don't want owners to start
importing vaccines for exotic diseases and using them to prevent
outbreaks when they have done something they shouldn't (such as swill
feeding) or see symptoms in their animals (thereby interfering with
serology in a primary outbreak).

Although there is a general skepticism against some vaccines,
especially live vaccines, there is nothing that prevents the
authorities from using vaccination as a disease control tool whenever
they find this appropriate. The introduction of bluetongue serotype 8
in 2008 was such a situation and I believe this is another one. To use
vaccination in animals that cannot be protected from exposure no
matter how you try, and that can also be certified as non-contagious,
is a clear-cut strategy and should not present a problem.

The Swedish non-vaccination policy is sometimes difficult to
comprehend (even for some Swedes), but it is not built on any fanatic
opposition against vaccines, it is simply common sense from a disease
surveillance perspective when a disease is either not present in the
country or only present at an extremely low level.

For this very reason we really appreciate all help we get from
colleagues with more first-hand experience of diseases that we rarely
encounter. Sometimes we can use the same methods as endemic countries
and sometimes we have to "mix and match strategies" used by others.

[Thanks to Susanna and others for their briefing messages. The number
of deaths in the affected herd has topped out at 20 animals. They are
now moving to acquire a suitable vaccine. We have been glad to help.

For those who may be a bit rusty about recognizing and handling an
anthrax outbreak:
- suspect any unexpected livestock death, usually bovine, and
especially in summer;
- take bloody swab and send to diagnostic lab for confirmation. Do not
necropsy. Move herd into another field as soon as you can, preferably
within the hour;
- burn carcass and any bloody soil. If there will be a delay, spray
carcass and area with 5 per cent formaldehyde to kill any lurking
organisms and to discourage scavengers. If you cannot burn, bury;
- if you suspect there might be cows incubating disease, inject with
long-acting antibiotics. (Wait for antibiotics to clear, say 7-8 days,
before ...);
- vaccinate with Sterne; vaccinate horses twice at 3 week interval.
Dairy cows being treated for mastitis will not take as the vaccine is
live, and will need to be re-vaccinated when they have been off any
antibiotics for 2 or more weeks;
- check animals twice a day for any showing a temperature. Vaccine
immunity kicks in by the 8th day following vaccination. 2 weeks after
vaccination herd can be let back into their previous pasture;
- just in case there are any animals whose vaccination was
unsuccessful (it happens) keep a watchful eye on the herd;
- check the neighbouring farms for any possible cases;
- equine cases are usually secondary so you need to check around for
the primary (cases);
- re-vaccinate annually for the next 3-5 years;
- and in the coming years be alert for any acute unexpected death,
especially in the summer. Deaths from contaminated feed usually occur
during the winter, but if this is happening there will be sudden
deaths over a 3 week period in different farms in a coherent area
reflecting the sales of this feed. - Mod.MHJ]
