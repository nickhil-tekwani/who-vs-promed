[Transmission of WPV1 (wild poliovirus type 1) and cVDPVs (circulating vaccine derived polioviruses) is continuing. Pakistan confirmed 5 new cases in the past week, and in the past 24 hours another 5 were confirmed (see section [3] below. With respect to cVDPVs, 17 cases totalled from 5 countries (Nigeria, DR Congo, Angola, Ethiopia and the Philippines) were confirmed in the past week, and an additional 3 countries had positive environmental samples (Pakistan, Cote d'Ivoire and Somalia). Nigeria had a new focus for cVDPV2 with a case in Anambra state, the 1st confirmed case with onset in 2020. The Philippines confirmed an additional case in the past 24-48 hours from Nueva Ecija province, in Central Luzon, north of Manila (see section [2] below.

For a map showing the locations of both WPV-associated cases and cVDPV-associated cases, see http://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/.

As done in previous posts, to visualize all of this activity, I am putting links to HealthMap/ProMED-mail maps of countries with poliovirus activity during the past 12-24 months below. The size of the list remains impressive, now with 25 countries: 16 in Africa, 5 in Asia, and 4 in the Western Pacific, with either WPV or cVDPV isolates in their countries. An important reminder is that positive environmental samples means that the virus is circulating in the area where the samples have been obtained. Hence, if a susceptible individual is infected with the virus, there is a chance the person may develop paralytic disease.

Philippine health department records 17th polio case
---------------------------------
The Philippine Health department reported the 17th polio case in the country on Saturday [15 Feb 2020], after a 1-year-old boy in Central Luzon tested positive for the virus.

Super Radyo dzBB reported Sunday [16 Feb 2020] morning that the boy is from Cabanatuan, Nueva Ecija.

Citing information from the Department of Health (DOH), the report said the boy had fever and experienced weakness in his lower left leg.

Meanwhile, the DOH said that environmental samples collected by the Research Institute of Tropical Medicine (RITM) from Butuanon River in the province of Cebu tested positive for the polio virus.

Also, the DOH said it has coordinated with the World Health Organization regarding polio vaccination efforts and proper response to the polio challenge.

[Information on the type of virus identified (presumably either cVDPV1 or cVDPV2) is not available at this time, nor is the date of onset of paralysis to know whether this case will be classified as a 2019 or 2020 case. Clearly, circulation of the polioviruses in the Philippines is continuing. Information on the virus type isolated as well as the date of onset of paralysis would be greatly appreciated. Note that this case is not the case reported in the weekly global update above, as this is the 17th case and the case in the global update was the 16th case.

Cabanatuan, Nueva Ecija is located approximately to the north of Manila on Luzon. A good map of the Philippines showing provinces can be found at: http://mapsof.net/philippines/philippines-regions-and-provinces. - Mod.MPP]

5 more polio cases found in KP, Balochistan
----------------------------
Just 2 days before the start of the nationwide polio campaign, apart from Karachi where it has been preponed [scheduled 1 week earlier] by 1 week, the National Institute of Health (NIH) has confirmed 5 more polio cases from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) and Balochistan. Due to inclusion of the latest cases, the tally for current year has reached 17, while 144 cases were reported in 2019, 12 in 2018 and only 8 cases in 2017.

As per the current year's [2020] data, 10 cases have been reported from KP, 5 from Sindh and 2 from Balochistan.

"Four (the latest) cases from KP have been reported from Lakki Marwat district. A 22-month-old boy, resident of Ghundi Hassan Khel Union Council (UC), Bettani tehsil, has been infected with polio. The 2nd victim is an 18-month-old girl, resident of Kotka Arab Khan UC, Bettani tehsil. The 3rd child is a 17-month-old boy, resident of Bakhmal Ahmad Zai UC, Serae Naurang tehsil, and the 4th an 11-month-old girl, resident of Abba Khel UC, Lakki Marwat tehsil," an official of the NIH said.

"The 5th case has been reported from Balochistan where a 7-month-old boy, resident of Thrata UC, Pishin tehsil and district, has been infected with the virus of the crippling disease. It was a case of refusal as the child has not been administered a single dose of vaccine," the official said.

With latest cases, this year's [2020] tally rises to 17.

In 2019 when 12 cases were reported from Balochistan, most of the victims belonged to Qila Abdullah, a district located at the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. The Emergency Polio Centre, Balochistan, has also initiated another polio vaccination campaign after a recent rise of cases in the province, and officials are hoping to control the sudden increase in polio cases in the province. Officials said that special measures were being taken in sensitive areas including Quetta, Pishin, Nasirabad and Qila Abdullah.

A number of families in Balochistan are still refusing to allow vaccinators to administrator polio drops to their children, which has become a hurdle for the authorities concerned in ending polio virus in the province.

National Manager, Emergency Operation Cell (EOC) for Polio Dr Rana Safdar, told Dawn that 2019 was a challenging year as the Peshawar fake news incident during the April [2019] campaign forced the authorities concerned to postpone anti-polio drives.

"Hence, after January 2019, the next effective campaign was carried out in December that year [2019]. This, coupled with poor routine immunisation in many parts of the country, created a huge immunity gap during 10 months. Therefore, the authorities decided to plug this gap through 3 back-to-back nationwide polio campaigns in [December 2019], [February 2020] and [April 2020] with 2 strategic response rounds in high risk districts in [January 2020] and [March 2020]," he said.

"Our efforts from [December 2019] till [April 2020] will push the virus back to 2017-18 levels, setting the stage for further push towards zero polio by focusing on increasing routine immunisation coverage and high quality campaigns, convergence of polio plus interventions in vulnerable communities, addressing malnutrition, improving basic health services and safe water supply, sanitation and hygiene and community ownership using respectable influencers from different walks of life," he said.

Dr Safdar said during the latest polio campaign beginning on [17 Feb 2020], 39.6 million children under the age of 5 would be targeted: 19.9m in Punjab, 9.26m in Sindh, 6.75m in KP, 2.46m in Balochistan, 0.69m in AJK, 0.24m in Gilgit-Baltistan and 0.356m in Islamabad. The campaign would feature a 5-day drive plus 2-day catch-up in the areas of core reservoirs and a 3-day drive with 2-day catch-up elsewhere.

About 265 000 personnel will strive to achieve the targets across Pakistan, including 26 943 area in-charges, 8388 UC medical officers and 202 767 mobile, 10 371 fixed and 11 974 transit team members. Considering its significance, the National EOC has also deployed 50 experts to facilitate preparedness and ground implementation of campaign activities by the local teams in priority areas.

Acknowledging role of the valiant frontline workers, the EOC has urged all parents to proactively get their children as well as those around them vaccinated to rapidly plug the immunity gap accumulated last year [2019]. Vaccination against all vaccine-preventable diseases, including polio, is available free of charge in government health facilities across the country.

[Pakistan continues to have circulation of the wild poliovirus as well as the vaccine derived poliovirus (see section [1] above for positive environmental samples with the cVDPV2). The increase in cases in the past 12+ months was not helped by the events in April 2019, when there was a fake-news report of an outbreak of problems related to the vaccine, claiming serious side effects, resulting in no national, sub-national or local vaccination campaigns. 144 WPV1 associated cases were confirmed with onset in 2019, and in the 1st 7 weeks of 2020, 17 cases of WpV1-associated disease have already been confirmed.

Of note, while these newly reported cases are from a media report, they are confirmed on the End Polio Pakistan website https://www.endpolio.com.pk/polioin-pakistan/polio-cases-in-provinces.

For a good map of Pakistan showing districts and provinces, see https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/pak215_pakistan_districts_v5_a0_20181203.pdf. Lakki Marwat is located in the KP Tribal districts, southwest of the Islamabad Capital Territory. Pishin district in Balochistan is just north of Quetta and shares a border with Afghanistan and Killa Abdullah, the district most affected in Balochistan during 2019. - Mod.MPP]
