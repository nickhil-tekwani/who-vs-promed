Crop disease threatens SWFL tomatoes
---------------------------------------------
A highly contagious disease has been found on a crop of tomato plants
in Immokalee. Late blight is not harmful to humans but could destroy
tomato crops in just days.
An alert was sent out to all Southwest Florida farmers to take
precautions, because the disease spreads easily and quickly.
"This goes very quickly. I've seen fields lost in a matter of a
week," said plant pathologist Dr. Pam Roberts. "It can take out any
part of the plant, especially the fruit."
Plants go from healthy green to blackened and shriveled and then rot.
Under a microscope, it's a lemon-shaped fungus. On a leaf, it's
brownish spots that grow into a white, fuzzy mold.
"It can reproduce very quickly. It can spread to new plants and
basically kill a plant in a matter of days," Roberts said. A farmer's
only defense is fungicide.
At Oakes Farmers Market in Naples, they're already feeling a
Wilma-induced tomato shortage. If late blight spreads, researchers
believe our only options will be international. "We're going to be
going to other sources, like Mexico and Honduras," said Lee Snyder of
Oakes Farmers Market.
With a tomato shortage, growers have to raise their prices to retail
outlets, which, in turn, raise prices for the consumer. That's why
Roberts is working to save crops. She, along with a team of
University of Florida researchers, is testing different fungicides to
see which one stops late blight before it has time to spread. "This
thing can spread for miles; everybody is at risk," Roberts said.
Unlike citrus canker, an infected tomato plant doesn't have to be
destroyed if farmers can kill and contain the late blight. The
disease is seasonal, normally kicking in mid-winter, when the weather
is slightly cool and humid, like it is now.

[Late blight, caused by _Phytophthora infestans_, can be a serious
disease of tomato (and more commonly potato) when the weather is
consistently cool and rainy. Late blight has resulted in numerous
epidemics of tomatoes throughout North America. Tremendous yield
reductions result in seasons when late blight epidemics occur.
Production areas that have experienced the most severe epidemics in
recent years include the Del Fuere Valley in Mexico; the mountain
regions of North Carolina, Tennessee, Pennsylvania, New York, New
Jersey, Alabama; and in certain coastal regions of California late in
the production season. Within the entire United States production
area, late blight ranks as the 8th most important tomato disease.
However, whenever late blight appears in production areas, it has the
potential to result in tremendous losses if environmental conditions
are favorable for disease spread. Breeding new varieties for
resistance, including the use of genetic engineering, is an active
area of research for control of this disease, which is managed with
sanitation and fungicides.
