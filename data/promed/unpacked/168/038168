Novel coronavirus infection - update - 14 May 2013
--------------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health in Saudi Arabia has informed WHO of an additional 4 laboratory-confirmed cases with infection of the novel coronavirus (nCoV).

The 1st patient was a 69-year-old woman with multiple coexisting medical conditions who became ill on [25 Apr 2013] and has died. The 2nd patient is a 48-year-old man with multiple coexisting medical conditions who became ill on [24 Apr 2013], and is in critical condition. The 3rd patient is an 81-year-old man with multiple coexisting medical conditions, who became ill on [26 Apr 2013], and is in critical condition. The 4th patient is a 56-year-old man with multiple coexisting medical conditions, who became ill on [7 May 2013]. He has recovered and has been discharged from hospital.

Since the beginning of May 2013 to date [14 May 2013], a total of 19 patients, including 9 deaths have been reported from the outbreak primarily linked to a health care facility in the Eastern part of Saudi Arabia. The government is conducting ongoing investigation into the outbreak.

From September 2012 to date [14 May 2013], WHO has been informed of a global total of 38 laboratory confirmed cases of human infection with nCoV, including 20 deaths.

Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns.

Health care providers are advised to be vigilant among recent travelers returning from areas affected by the virus who develop severe SARI. Specimens from patients' lower respiratory tracts should be obtained for diagnosis where possible. Clinicians are reminded that nCoV infection should be considered even with atypical signs and symptoms in patients who are significantly immune compromised.

All Member States are reminded to promptly assess and notify WHO of any new case of infection with nCoV, along with information about potential exposures that may have resulted in infection and a description of the clinical course.

WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.

WHO continues to closely monitor the situation.

Saudi Arabia has confirmed 6 new cases of the SARS-like novel coronavirus in its Eastern province, state media reported on Monday [13 May 2013] and yesterday [14 May 2013], citing the health ministry.

It reported 4 new cases late Monday [13 May 2013] and 2 more late yesterday [14 May 2013]. In one of the new cases, the patient has been treated and released from the hospital, while in the others, the patients still were being treated, the Saudi Press Agency reported.

On Sunday [12 May 2013], Saudi Arabia said it had logged a total of 24 confirmed cases since the disease was identified last year [2012]; 15 ended in deaths. In its latest outbreak in the Eastern Region, it said it had 15 confirmed cases; 9 ended in deaths.

World Health Organization officials visiting Saudi Arabia to consult with authorities on the outbreak said on Sunday [12 May 2013] that it seemed likely the new virus could be passed between humans, but only after prolonged, close contact.

The new virus (nCoV) can cause coughing, fever, and pneumonia. A virus from the same family triggered the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) that swept the world after emerging in Asia and killed 775 people in 2003.
