One turkey and 132 chickens, geese, and ducks have been destroyed by
authorities trying to contain an outbreak of a deadly and highly infectious
bird virus in a Las Vegas neighborhood.

Kimberley Smith, spokeswoman for a multi-agency Exotic Newcastle Disease
(END) task force, said Tuesday that 9 properties near Nellis Air Force base
are believed affected by the avian disease. Birds have been eradicated, and
disinfection efforts have begun at 6 properties, she said. So-called
"depopulation" teams were due Tuesday to eliminate birds from 3 more
properties.

The discovery of infected chickens in a backyard flock last week prompted
federal and state officials to expand a strict quarantine on poultry and
pet birds from California to southern Nevada, including all of Clark County
and parts of Nye County, south of Amargosa Valley.

The virus poses no threat to humans, and the sale of chicken and other
poultry products is not affected by the quarantine. However, pet and feed
stores have been told that no birds can be moved or sold.

Nevada has no commercial poultry industry. But state and federal
agriculture officials fear the spread of the disease could taint the
multi-billion-dollar Southern California poultry industry.

More than 1.7 million chickens have been slaughtered as a precaution in
Southern California since the virus was first found there in September 2002.

Utah and Oregon agriculture officials last week banned the importation of
birds from areas in California and Nevada affected by Exotic Newcastle Disease.

[A recent OIE posting suggested there is some strain similarity between
past strains of Newcastle disease virus in Mexico and the strains in
Nevada. Although the strains may be closely related to known prior Mexican
isolates, this does not necessarily indicate proof of origin. The minor
differences indicate possibly independent sources. - Mod.TG]
