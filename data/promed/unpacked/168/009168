[The reports of West Nile virus in animals in Guadeloupe and Jamaica are
the 1st reports of the presence of the virus in these Caribbean islands. It
is unclear whether these are based on virus isolation or serological testing.
Previous reports of WNV infection of birds in the Dominican Republic were
based on the results of serological tests. Apart from these reports there has
been no other confirmation of the presence of WNV in the Caribbean region
except for a single human case reported from the Cayman Islands in 2002,
whose status and origin are not clear. - Mod.CP/JW]
