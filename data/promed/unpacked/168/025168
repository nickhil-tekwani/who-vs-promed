Dengue fever causes its 1st victim
-------------------------------------
12 days after the occurrence of symptoms resembling a common cold, a
59-year-old man from Cobachi community, La Colorada, Mexico, died after
developing a clinical condition corresponding to hemorrhagic dengue
fever. The patient is the 4th individual from Sonora State infected with
the dengue virus, and he was the 1st man to die this season from this
infectious disease.
In this case, the patient's clinical condition deteriorated because he had
high blood pressure, and finally an acute myocardial infarction was the
final cause of his death on 21 Mar 2005. The patient felt ill on 9 Mar
2005, both him and his relatives thought he had a common cold; 4 days later
he was admitted at the State General Hospital, where he had 2
cardio-respiratory arrests.
Healthcare personnel initially notified the patient's relatives that he had
hemorrhagic dengue, and the diagnosis was confirmed last Tuesday by the
State Health Laboratory. Yesterday, Mexico Health Secretary, Dr. Raymundo
Lopez-Vucovich, decreed a public alert regarding the spread of this
tropical disease even before the very beginning of summer. He pointed out
that there are appropriate conditions for the disease's development: both
larval and adult _Aedes aegypti_, as well as humidity and rubbish in places
where the insects may develop.
[Even though] there is a 1st fatal case of dengue hemorrhagic fever, the
Health Secretary said that Sonorans should not worry, and he asked them to
keep their yards appropriately clean to eliminate breeding places for
mosquitoes.

The Centre for Health Protection has confirmed a Dengue fever case

The Tsing Yi woman travelled to Indonesia 14-23 Mar 2005 and came down with

Margaret Hospital on 31 Mar 2005 and has recovered.
Her husband, who had travelled with her, developed fever and headache on 28
Mar 2005 and is at Princess Margaret Hospital. People should stay alert to
the threat of Dengue fever and take measures against mosquito breeding and
bites. Travellers should wear long-sleeved tops and trousers and use insect
repellent. They should also seek medical advice as soon as possible if they
feel unwell after returning from their trip.
Latest information on Dengue fever in other places is available on the
Travellers' Health Service.

[Dengue, malaria, and yellow fever are all mosquito-borne diseases. An
outbreak of any of these 3 diseases tends to be followed by either or both
of the others in indigenous communities. In particular, the _St. aegypti_
[_Ae. aegypti_] mosquito is the vector for urban yellow fever as well as
for dengue fever. The recent report on an outbreak of yellow fever in
Putumayo, Colombia (see ProMED posting Yellow fever - Colombia (Putumayo):
alert, Archive 20050403.0958) was an example of threat of dengue in the
making. - Mod.RY]

East Timor tackles dengue fever epidemic
-------------------------------------
An epidemic of dengue fever has killed more than 40 people in East Timor
since the beginning of 2005. Portuguese newspapers say the Government has
called for a major clean-up campaign to eliminate the mosquitoes that
spread the viral disease. The former Portuguese colony is one of several
areas currently affected by the disease, which is endemic in the
Asia-Pacific region.
The 4 strains of the dengue virus cause symptoms ranging from a
non-specific viral syndrome to severe and fatal hemorrhagic disease.

[A total of more than 40 deaths due to an epidemic of dengue fever is
indeed a fairly grave matter. Dengue fever can be caused by any one of 4
types of the dengue virus: DEN-1, DEN-2, DEN-3, and DEN-4. However, there
are no details with regard to the following: laboratory confirmation; the
proportion of the 4 strains; or mosquito strains and their geographic
distribution. RFI: anyone who has more updated data is urged to contact
ProMED. - Mod.RY]
