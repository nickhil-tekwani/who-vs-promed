A total of 6 patients have been diagnosed with malaria in Penang
[Malaysia]. The area affected is Paya Terubong and there are a number of
orchards and rubber plantations in this area.
The 1st case was on 17 Jul 2005 when an 11-year-old girl died in the
hospital due to malaria. Her grandfather also was admitted in the ICU for
malaria. He regained consciousness and is now in a stable condition.
On 20 Jul, 4 men from the same area were admitted with malaria. 2 were
Indonesians, 1 Burmese and 1 local Malaysian.
On 22 Jul, 3 of them were confirmed to have blackwater fever [blackwater
fever is the consequence of intravascular haemolysis and hematuria in
_Falciparum_ malaria, - Mod.RY].
On 25 Jul, the Penang State Health department sent a medical van to the
affected area. A foreign worker from Kedah who was referred to Penang for
treatment died from malaria.
So far there have been no new cases and all the patients that were affected
were from the same area.

ISTM (International Society of Travel Medicine). The original query,
entitled "Malaria transmission in Penang?" was written by Graham Fry,
Tropical Medical Bureau, Ireland, <graham.fry@tmb.ie>. ProMED is grateful
to Dr. Lai for her permission to post this valuable information in our
Digest and to Graham Fry and ISTM for the original query. Graham Fry's
query reads: "Over the past week I have seen a patient from Penang
(Malaysia) who is now returning back home. He tells me that (from his
personal contacts in Penang) there has been a recent Malaria outbreak which
has affected the local population and apparently led to some travel
restrictions etc. I know there was a small outbreak in Penang some years
ago (January 2000, associated with immigrants from Indonesia) but I have
seen nothing about anything recent from the news wires etc. Has anyone
heard anything specific about a recent outbreak?" ProMED posted one report
on 5 Jan 2000. See also: Malaria - Malaysia (Penang): alert 20000105.0006.
