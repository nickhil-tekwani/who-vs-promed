Hepatitis E in Sudan - WHO update 3
-----------------------------------
From 22 May 2004 to 17 Sep 2004, a total of 6861 cases and 87 deaths of
suspected hepatitis E was reported from health clinics in the Greater
Darfur region through the early warning alert and response system (EWARN).
The total number of reported cases per week continues to increase. West
Darfur remains the most affected area.
There are ongoing control measures being implemented in the 3 states.
Health agencies, including the Ministry of Health, UNICEF, Oxfam, Medecins
du Monde-France, Medecins sans Frontieres-Holland, the United Nations Joint
Logistics Centre (UNJLC), and the International Committee of the Red Cross
have been working with WHO to scale up mass hygiene education programs,
increase the availability of soap, dig new wells, and ensure effective
chlorination of water bladders and wells. South Darfur has the poorest
water and sanitation indicators. WHO is working with the Water and
Environmental Sanitation Department (WES) and the State Ministry of Health
(SMOH) to develop an Emergency Environmental Health plan for Internally
Displaced Persons camps in South Darfur.
Existing resources remain insufficient to cover the basic water and
sanitation needs of the displaced populations in Darfur. Additional efforts
are still needed to reduce the number of new hepatitis E infections, and to
prevent the spread of other waterborne diseases.
