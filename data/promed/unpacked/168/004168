[The previous OIE report quoted for 10 May 2018 was of a diagnostic necropsy with no other information. It seems to be related to the earlier OIE report of sheep deaths; see 4 Apr 2018 Anthrax - Hungary: (CS) ovine, OIE 20180404.5727640. The link for this May 2018 OIE report is:

Livestock anthrax is infrequent in Hungary, and so cases may be missed. These 2 outbreaks in 2018 may engender more reports of suspect deaths and maybe even "anthrax." - Mod.MHJ
