[MERS-CoV is a coronavirus (CoV) which causes Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), a severe respiratory disease, in humans. It was identified in humans in April 2012. See more at http://www.oie.int/en/for-the-media/press-releases/detail/article/update-august-2014-questions-answers-on-middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-mers-cov/ (updated August 2014).

This outbreak in Iran confirms the recently published ProMED-mail request for information on a suspect case in this country; see ProMED-mail post 20141027.2904032.

In the report that was submitted to the OIE, Iran indicates that the source of infection was due to the illegal movement of animals imported from Pakistan (see epidemiological comment above). There were 3 cases among the 18 susceptible camels.

This now begs the question: What is the real situation of MERS-CoV in Pakistan? - Mod.CRD
