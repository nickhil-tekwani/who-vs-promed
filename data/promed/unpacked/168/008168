Girl, 16, is sixth victim of virus
--------------------------------------
An unidentified virus that had led to the deaths of 5 people over 11
days in a pediatric nursing home has claimed another victim, a 16-
year-old girl who died yesterday morning.
The state Department of Public Health is working with the federal
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta to pinpoint
and identify the illness, suspected to be caused by a virus.
State health officials said that the respiratory illness has been
diagnosed in 25 of the nursing home's residents and that 3 of the
home's employees have sought medical treatment for symptoms.
Alfred DeMaria, a state epidemiologist, said that preliminary tests
on hospitalized patients and the fatalities indicate an adenovirus
may be to blame. Two autopsy reports indicated viral pneumonia,
he said, which is a suspected symptom of adenovirus.
DeMaria described pediatric nursing home patients as ''the sickest
of kids.'' Residents of the Northampton pediatric ward, one of only
4 or 5 in the state, typically suffer from chronic respiratory
problems, head injuries, and cancer, he said, and are often already
critically ill and extremely vulnerable to infections.
Pawelec said the illness, whose initial symptoms include fever and
respiratory distress, first surfaced 11 days ago when a 12-year old
girl fell ill. She was taken to a nearby hospital and died of
complications the next day.
The virus struck again last Thursday, fatally infecting a 14-year-old
boy and a 29-year-old patient. Last weekend, 2 more patients,
ages 10 and 11, died from the illness.
Since the outbreak, 3 hospital employees have sought emergency
room care for virus symptoms, and one was hospitalized for
several days. The federal Occupational Safety and Health
Administration has begun an investigation.
''The number of deaths here is unusual, no question,'' DiMaria said.
''There's a concentration of very sick kids exposed to a virus that
sort of put them over the edge. If they didn't have [previous
illnesses it would have just given them a cold.''
DiMaria said that earlier this year there was a viral outbreak on the
pediatric ward of a Groton nursing home. Twenty children were
affected, and 2 died as a result of the infection.
