Bella Cucina is recalling 6-ounce glass jars of porcini and parmesan
pesto, because of the potential for bacterial contamination. The
pesto's pH is higher than it should be and as a result the jars could
harbor _Clostridium botulinum_. This bacterium can produce the toxin
that causes botulism, a potentially fatal form of food poisoning. No
illnesses have been reported. The pesto was sold through mail orders
and in stores around the country in jars marked with lot numbers
0081028 and 0081018. Details by phone at 678-539-8400.

[Because of the potential severity of botulism, ProMED-mail posts
such recalls even if, as in this case, there are no human cases
associated with the food. Most of the food recalls are related to
defective preparation procedures, which could, but not necessarily
do, result in the germination of viable spores of _C. botulinum_. - Mod.LL]
