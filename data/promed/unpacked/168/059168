[Re: Trypanosomiasis (Chagas disease) - USA (02): (TX) comment 20111024.3167]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Referring to the interesting message by Susan Rektorik Henley
(stressing that in Texas, people who camp out or have "fishing camp"
structures along the rivers and the poor who live in substandard
housing may be exposed to triatomine bugs), I wish to complete this
information, by stressing the possible oral infection of humans when
eating or drinking food contaminated by infected bug feces (infective
metacyclic trypomastigotes).

So, even in the absence of direct contact between humans and bugs,
human infection may occur as a foodborne disease. This way of
infection has been observed several times especially with fruit juices
(Venezuela and Brazil), but could occur in various circumstances,
possibly as well in Texas. Again, Chagas disease may not be detected
early but it may also never be detected late...

Additional information is available from
Pereira KS, Schmidt FL, Guaraldo AM, et al: Chagas' Disease as a
Foodborne Illness. J Food Prot. 2009; 72(2): 441-6.

[ProMED-mail thanks Marc Desquesnes for his comment and the reference
to the review on the subject. Foodborne Chagas is probably much more
common in endemic countries than previously thought. ProMED has
covered the last years' foodborne outbreaks in Brazil and Venezuela
(see below). - Mod.EP]
