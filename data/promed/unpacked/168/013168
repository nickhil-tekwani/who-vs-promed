_Meloidogyne enterolobii_ (EPPO A2 List) is reported for the first time from Nigeria. During a nematode survey, tubers of _Dioscorea rotundata_ (yam) showing galls were collected from markets and farmer's fields from 2012 to February 2013.

Laboratory analysis (isozyme patterns, PCR, pathogenicity tests) confirmed the identity of the nematode in samples collected from [several] Nigerian states. This is also the first time that _M. enterolobii_ is found causing galls on _D. rotundata_.

[Root knot nematodes (_Meloidogyne_ species) attack a wide range of plants and cause significant economic losses in many vegetable and fruit crops. The genus contains around 70 species and is found worldwide in tropical and subtropical regions in many types of soil. Symptoms may include stunting, wilting, and leaf chlorosis, and large galls are formed throughout the root system affecting plant vigour and even killing the host. Affected plants may show increased sensitivity to other bacterial or fungal pathogens.

The nematodes can persist in the soil for years and are spread by plant material, soil, and mechanical means (for example contaminated equipment). Once they have been established in an area, it is difficult to control or eradicate them. Disease management requires an integrated approach including phytosanitary and cultural measures, nematicides, and use of resistant crop varieties.

_M. enterolobii_ (synonym _M. mayaguensis_) is polyphagous and, although its precise host range is still unknown, has been found on many economically important crops including potato, coffee, soybean, sweet potato, beans, guava, melons, and several solanaceous and cucurbit vegetables. While it originates in subtropical areas, it also poses a serious threat to glasshouse crops in cooler regions. It is considered an emerging and particularly aggressive pathogen with increased virulence against crop varieties resistant to other root knot nematodes. For example, it is able to reproduce on tobacco, capsicum, watermelon, and tomato varieties (including root stocks) resistant to other _Meloidogyne_ species.

Elsewhere in the region, it has also been reported on potato and guava in South Africa (ProMED-mail post 20130918.1951868).
