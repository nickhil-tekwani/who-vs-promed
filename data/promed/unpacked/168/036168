The provincial government of South Cotabato sent a medical team on Monday [30 Jun 2014] to a remote village in Lake Sebu town due to a reported outbreak of diarrhea that already left 2 children dead and affected around 250 other residents.

South Cotabato Gov. Daisy Avance-Fuentes said Monday, 30 Jun 2014, they dispatched a team of doctors, nurses and personnel from the Integrated Provincial Health Office's (IPHO) epidemiology and surveillance unit to Barangay Ned in Lake Sebu to look into the reported outbreak and address the immediate needs of the affected residents. She said they also sent a dump truck owned by the local government to deliver medical and food supplies to the area.

Citing an initial report received by the IPHO, the governor said the outbreak affected 6 of the remotest sitios of Barangay Ned, which is near the tri-boundaries of South Cotabato, Sultan Kudarat and Sarangani provinces. She said these comprise Sitios Kibang, Lubo, Tinugas, Proper, Blit and Tasufaw of Barangay Ned.

"Some of the affected sitios were very remote and already near the boundary of T'boli and Lake Sebu, so it was quite difficult for our personnel to penetrate the area," she said at the flag-raising ceremony of the provincial government on Monday [30 Jun 2014] morning. Fuentes said the village reported that 2 children in the area died late last week after suffering from symptoms of suspected diarrhea.

Around 250 residents have also fallen ill and are currently receiving treatment from barangay health workers, she said.

For his part, Lake Sebu Mayor Antonio Fungan said in a radio interview that the reported symptoms suffered by the affected residents were diarrhea, severe abdominal pain and cramps, loose bowel movements, and fever.

Based an assessment conducted by local health personnel, he said the outbreak could have been caused by contaminated drinking water. Fungan said that the area lacks potable water systems, forcing residents to depend on spring water resources and deep wells for their needs.

[The presence of severe abdominal pain and fever speak strongly against cholera as a diagnosis here. Dysentery, either bacterial due to _Shigella_ species or amoebic due to _Entamoeba histolytica_, is likely to be the etiology. - Mod.LL
