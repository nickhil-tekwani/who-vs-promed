The World Bank and the TAFS (Trust in Animals and Food Safety) forum
have jointly published the 'World Livestock Disease Atlas'. It is a
major quantitative analysis of global animal health data (2006-2009)
and addresses questions such as:

- Which livestock diseases cause the heaviest losses globally?
- Which countries suffer the worst disease-related losses among their
livestock populations?
- Which livestock species are most affected by diseases?
- What are the latest changes over time in all this?

The atlas is a joint publication of the World Bank and the TAFS forum,
in collaboration with OIE [World Organization for Animal Health] and
FAO [UN Food and Agriculture Organization]. It is available for
download on the TAFS forum website at
http://www.tafsforum.org/livestock-disease-atlas.html.
The document is a global public good and hence available free of
charge, however please consider making a voluntary donation to the
TAFS forum so that we can continue delivering products like this.
