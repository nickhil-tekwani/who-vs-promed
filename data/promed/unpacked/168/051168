Queensland Health has reported an imported case of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) infection in an unvaccinated male who traveled from Bali to Australia in late 2019.

JEV is a mosquito-borne flavivirus and a leading cause of encephalitis throughout Asia. The virus is largely endemic in Indonesia, and a JEV vaccination program for children was initiated on the island of Bali in March 2018 (1).

Several reports have previously described encephalitis caused by JEV infections in travelers who contracted their illness in Bali (2, 3), including an unvaccinated, 10-year-old Australian girl, in 1989 (4).

Laboratory diagnostics performed at Forensic and Scientific Services (FSS) detected JEV RNA by real-time TaqMan qRT-PCR in a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sample taken from the imported JEV 2019 case. Specific anti-JEV IgM antibodies were detected in the same CSF sample and in an additional serum sample collected 2 days later using a multiplexed flavivirus microsphere immunoassay. Viral culture of the CSF sample yielded a JEV isolate, JEV Bali 2019.

The JEV Bali 2019 isolate was further characterized by massive parallel sequencing using both the NextSeq Illumina and GridION Oxford Nanopore platforms. The complete JEV 2019 genome sequence obtained was most closely related to a JEV Bali 2017 sequence (GenBank accession number LC461961) with which it shared 99.23% nucleotide identity.

Persistence of JEV and associated disease transmission in the popular tourist isle of Bali highlight this pathogen as an ongoing public health threat, and the continued incidence of cases with serious neurological symptoms, as described in this report, emphasize the importance of appropriate health and vaccination advice to prospective travelers to the region. The development of improved surveillance and diagnostics for JEV and other medically important pathogens should also be prioritized. Recently, whole genome sequencing has substantially enhanced these capabilities, affording timely provision of data regarding the types and genetic characteristics of circulating strains.

The diagnosis of the current JEV 2019 case with a history of travel in Bali, and rapid generation of a complete genome sequence from the recovered JEV Bali 2019 isolate, resulted from the combined efforts of the Public Health Virology and Microbiology laboratories at FSS, Queensland Health, which incorporate the Queensland Reference Centre for Microbial and Public Health Genomics; and the Queensland Health Medical staff at the Sunshine Coast University Hospital, Queensland, Australia.

[As Dr. Pyke points out, individuals infected with JE virus and returning to Australia from Bali, Indonesia have appeared before, as recently as 2018 (see Japanese encephalitis - Indonesia: (BA,SW) 20181108.6132871).

The very thorough and remarkably rapid laboratory testing established the JE virus etiology in this case. It is interesting that the sequences of their isolate matched 99.23% with the JEV Bali 2017 JE virus sequence. The current condition of the patient is not mentioned but obviously is a clinical case of JE. It will be interesting to learn whether JE vaccination is recommended for visitors to Bali, a popular tourist destination, and whether tourists will heed vaccination advice, given that JE cases are sporadic and less than 1% of JE virus infected individuals develop clinical illness.

The USA CDC notes that among patients who develop encephalitis, 20%-30% die. Although some symptoms improve after the acute illness, 30%-50% of survivors continue to have neurologic, cognitive, or psychiatric symptoms (see https://www.cdc.gov/japaneseencephalitis/symptoms/index.html). - Mod.TY
