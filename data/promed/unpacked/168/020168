[1] Liberia: attack on quarantine center
Date: Sun 17 Aug 2014
Source: CBS News [edited]
http://www.cbsnews.com/news/report-armed-men-attack-liberia-ebola-clinic-freeing-patients


Liberian officials fear EVD could soon spread through the capital's largest slum after residents raided a quarantine center for suspected patients and took items including bloody sheets and mattresses. The violence in the West Point slum occurred late Sat [16 Aug 2014] and was led by residents angry that patients were brought to the holding center from other parts of Monrovia, Tolbert Nyenswah, assistant health minister, said Sun [17 Aug 2014].

Local witnesses told Agence France Presse that there were armed men among the group that attacked the clinic. "They broke down the doors and looted the place. The patients all fled," said Rebecca Wesseh, who witnessed the attack and whose report was confirmed by residents and the head of Health Workers Association of Liberia, George Williams. Up to 30 patients were staying at the center, and many of them fled at the time of the raid, said Nyenswah [other reports put the number at 17. - Mod.JW]. Once they are located, they will be transferred to the EVD center at Monrovia's largest hospital, he said.

The attack comes just one day after a report of a crowd of several hundred local residents chanting "No Ebola in West Point" drove away a burial team and their police escort that had come to collect the bodies of suspected EVD victims in a slum in the capital, Reuters reports. West Point residents went on a "looting spree," stealing items from the clinic that were likely infected, said a senior police official, who insisted on anonymity because he was not authorized to brief the press. The residents took medical equipment and mattresses and sheets that had bloodstains, he said. EVD is spread through bodily fluids including blood, vomit, feces and sweat.

"All between the houses, you could see people fleeing with items looted from the patients," the official said, adding that he now feared "the whole of West Point will be infected." Some of the looted items were visibly stained with blood, vomit and excrement, said Richard Kieh, who lives in the area.

The incident creates a new challenge for Liberian health officials who were already struggling to contain the outbreak. New figures released by the World Health Organization show that Liberia has recorded more EVD deaths (413) than any of the other affected countries.

Liberian police restored order to the West Point neighborhood on Sun [17 Aug 2014]. Sitting on land between the Montserrado River and the Atlantic Ocean, West Point is home to at least 50 000 people, according to a 2012 survey. Distrust of government runs high in West Point, with rumors regularly circulating that the government plans to clear the slum out entirely. Though there had been talk of putting West Point under quarantine should EVD break out there, assistant health minister Nyenswah said Sunday [17 Aug 2014] that no such step has been taken. "West Point is not yet quarantined, as is being reported," he said.

While the armed attack is likely the most brazen attack on health workers trying to contain the deadly outbreak, it is far from the 1st in the region worst-hit by it. There have been numerous reports of locals attacking those trying to stop the disease by throwing stones at aid workers, blocking aid convoys, and forcibly removing patients from clinics. Many locals blame foreigners for bringing the disease, saying it had never been there before they arrived. The mistrust of central government and help from outside runs deep in this part of West Africa. All 3 countries worst-hit by the outbreak -- Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea -- are relatively recently off decades of either brutal civil war or iron-fisted dictatorships.

[2] Liberia: PPE shortage critical

Liberia Ebola SitRep no. 84, 7 Aug 2014
------------------
[See Logistics/Supply Chain Highlights chart at end. Comment by Dr IM Mackay:

"This is appalling. It's been 8-days since PHEIC [Public Health Emergency of International Concern, WHO] announced & these are #liberia #PPE [personal protective equipment] stocks https://twitter.com/MackayIM/status/500813451564834816."

The most recent Sitrep I could find on the MOHSW website is No. 89 dated 12 Aug 2014 and does not contain a Logistics/Supply Chain Highlights chart: http://mohsw.gov.lr/documents/Liberia%20Ebola%20SitRep%2089%20Aug%2012,%202014.pdf. I sincerely hope a few more tons of PPE have reached Liberia in the 10 days since the 6 Aug 2014 inventory. - Mod.JW]
