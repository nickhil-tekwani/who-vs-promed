An epidemiological study in the city of Corrientes [capital of Corrientes province] confirmed the year-round risk of transmission and reminded the population of the importance of environmental sanitation and responsible ownership of pets.

The study was carried out by parasite biology researchers of the Department of Biology, Faculty of Exact and Natural Sciences, and Engineering of the National University of the Northeast (UNNE), with the aim of identifying insect vectors and potential synanthropic reservoirs [ecologically associated with humans] of cutaneous [CL] and visceral leishmaniasis [VL] in the city of Corrientes . The study also attempted to identify the cultural, environmental, and climactic variables that favor the abundance of vectors and reservoirs, in order to characterize the transmission cycle and risk scenarios of the disease.

There is active transmission of VL in the province of Corrientes. Human cases and canine reservoirs of visceral leishmaniasis reported in the department of Corrientes and the presence of the vector, _Lutzomyia longipalpis_, confirmed in cross-sectional studies, motivated the researchers to initiate an investigation to determine the spatial and temporal distribution of the [phlebotomine] sandfly population.

The eco-epidemiological study was led by Dr Beatriz Elena Oscherov, UNNE researcher, and was conducted in coordination with the Leishmaniasis Research Network in Argentina (REDILA) and with the logistical support of the municipality of the city of Corrientes. Oscherov noted that this type of epidemiological study makes it possible to determine the risk and optimize the effectiveness of prevention and control strategies.

In the UNNE research, sandflies were sampled monthly from March 2013 to July 2015, in 3 areas of the city: periurban-rural area, intermediate area, and downtown area. In each of the areas, occupied dwellings with environmental characteristics favorable to the development of sandflies ("worst case"), were selected. Miniature light traps were placed at each location for 14 hours.

Also, in December 2013, an entomological sampling was conducted with traps placed over 3 consecutive days around homes in the city. In all cases the sites were georeferenced and the local temperature and relative humidity (maximum and minimum) recorded.

Results. _Lu. longipalpis_, _Nyssomyia neivai_, _Migonemyia migonei_, _Evandromyia_ females from the cortelezzii complex, and _Micropygomia quinquefer_ were captured. The highest total abundance was recorded in April, with and average temperature of 21.3 deg C [70.3 deg F] and the lowest in August with an average temperature of 17.0 deg C [62.6 deg F]. In all samples _Lu. longipalpis_ was captured, more abundantly in April and May (autumn) and fewer in the winter months (June to August). Captures progressively increased again starting in September (beginning of the spring).

_Lu. longipalpis_ was present in the 3 environments, but _Ny. neivai_ was more abundant in the periurban-rural area and also more abundant in autumn. _Mi. migonei_ was recorded in autumn and spring in the periurban-rural and intermediate areas, but due to the low number collected it may be considered an occasional species.

On these results, doctor Oscherov explained that the widespread presence of _Lu. longipalpis_, primary vector of _Leishmania infantum_ (_L. chagasi_), in the urban area of the city of Corrientes, and the occasional presence of its putative vector _Mg. migonei_, together with the reporting of autochthonous human and canine cases of VL, suggest a risk of transmission throughout the year.

The risk of transmission is heterogeneous in space and time, lower in winter, despite the fact that the actual incidence of cases could increase early in this season due to the peak of vectors in autumn and the parasite's intrinsic incubation time.

She noted that the studies show the importance of knowing the "biodynamics" of sandflies in extensive studies, to contribute to the effectiveness of control strategies and epidemiological surveillance.

"Environmental sanitation and responsible ownership of pets become relevant as ways to prevent the development of the vector and the spread of leishmaniasis," remarked Oscherov, who acknowledged the work of the team in charge of the study, composed by Ms Analia Araujo (fellow, UNNE-CONICET [National Scientific and Technical Research Council] and REDILA), Mr Paul Berrozpe (INMeT-Ministry of Health, REDILA/CONICET), and Paola Benitez (student, Biological Sciences degree).

Worldwide, there are approximately 500 000 new cases and more than 50 000 deaths of VL per year. Infected dogs, with or without clinical manifestations, are the main urban reservoir and transmitter of the disease to humans.

The high reproductive rates in the dog population and the increasing abandonment of these, along with the adaptation of the vector to urban areas and its dispersion, have contributed to the worrisome increase in recent years of the incidence, mortality, and geographic spread of the
disease, as well as a change in the epidemiology of the disease, now present in urban and periurban areas.

In Argentina the largest number of cases of VL, has been registered in the province of Misiones. There have also been cases reported in the provinces of Corrientes and Santiago del Estero, and autochthonous canine cases in Formosa.

[The key result is that the widespread presence of sandfly vectors in the urban area of Corrientes, Argentina, together with autochthonous human and canine cases of VL, suggest a risk of transmission throughout the year.

The study also provides information which will help control the transmission: reduction of the burden of sandfly vectors and wild dogs. - Mod.EP
