More than 400 people have contracted HFRS in Bashkortostan; 2 deaths
--------------------------------------------------------------------
A 2nd fatal case of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) has been
recorded in Bashkortostan. Oleg Mavlutov, head of the Sanitary Inspectorate
of Rospotrebnadzor's [Territorial Directorate of the Federal Services for
Consumer Protection and Human Welfare] regional management, announced today
[11 Jul 2008] that a 50 year old resident of Ufa had died in hospital. The
1st fatal case of HFRS was recorded a month before in the infectious
diseases hospital of Ufa.

Mavlutov stated that: "From the beginning of the epidemiological season
more than 400 people with HFRS [have been] recorded in Bashcortostan. This
figure almost is twice that recorded last year [2007] observed Mavlutov.
According to a local epidemiologist, the prevalence of the HFRS virus in
Bashkortostan, which is one among the largest foci of this disease in the
world, fluctuates cyclically every 3-4 years. In his opinion the impending
peak in the prevalence of the virus will coincide with increased abundance
of the red field vole population -- the principal vector of HFRS. The
medical opinion is that the number of HFRS patients will begin to decline
from now following a pattern observed in previous years.

This year [2008], rodent control measures in the Republic have been
allocated RUB 4 250 000 (USD 183 310) with the result that no cases of
disease have occurred in sanatoria in holiday resort areas in
Bashkortostan. According to Mavlutov the Ufa municipality has allocated
additional funds for rodent control in an area of 1600 hectares (3954
acres). An education campaign to raise public awareness of the problem is
in progress.

[Bashkortostan is one of the "leading" regions of Russia and the world for
HFRS morbidity. This region had the highest incidence of HFRS in Russia
last year (2007).

From 7 to 33 per cent of rodents in Bashkortostan are carriers of the
virus causing HFRS. The peak year for HFRS morbidity in Bashkortostan was
1997, when 9000 people contracted the disease, 34 of whom died. In 2006, 5
inhabitants died from HFRS, when the number of infected people was more
than 2000. - Corr.BA

Hantaviruses (family _Bunyaviridae_, genus _Hantavirus_) are enveloped RNA
viruses, carried primarily by rodents or insectivores of specific species.
Three hantaviruses, Puumala, Dobrava, and Saaremaa, are known to cause
haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in Europe. Puumala virus,
carried by the bank vole (_Myodes glareolus_, previously known as
_Clethrionomys glareolus_) and Saaremaa virus, carried by the striped field
mouse (_Apodemus agrarius_) have been found in Denmark, Estonia, southeast
Finland, Germany, Russia, Slovakia, and Slovenia. Dobrava virus, carried by
the yellow-necked mouse (_A. flavicollis_) has been found in Albania,
Bosnia-Herzegovina, Czech Republic, Croatia, Greece, Hungary, Russia,
Serbia, and Slovenia and causes severe HFRS.

It would be useful to know the identity of the virus (or viruses)
responsible for HFRS in the Republic of Bashkortostan.
