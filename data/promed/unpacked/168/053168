Tick-borne encephalitis death toll in Russia rises
--------------------------------------------------
The head of Rospotrebnadzor (the Federal Service for Consumer Affairs
and Human Welfare), announced that in total throughout Russia 289 602
people had sought medial attention as a consequence of tick bites. 67
576 of these cases were children. These numbers are less than
recorded for the same period in in 2009.

The same is true for cases of tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) virus
infection. However, the number of deaths from TBE is causing concern.
The 2010 tick season is not over yet, but the number of fatal cases
of TBE is comparable to that reported in 2009. There have been 274
fatalities in 40 federal administrative divisions and 35 of the
fatalities were children. In total 250 cases have been laboratory
confirmed, 7 of which were fatal. By comparison, in 2009 there were
445 TBE cases distributed through 35 regions of Russia, and 43 of
these cases were children. In total 377 cases were laboratory
confirmed in 2009, including the 7 fatalities.

The main prevention option is vaccination. The current vaccine does
not provide 100 percent protection against infection as a consequence
of tick bite. However vaccination will certainly prevent any residual
disability or death. In total 406 836 people have been vaccinated in
Russia so far during 2010.
