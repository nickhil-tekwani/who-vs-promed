A new report says dirty cooling towers may be to blame for a legionnaires' disease outbreak at San Quentin State Prison [California]. Water was shut off at San Quentin State Prison following a possible outbreak of legionnaires' disease in late August [2015]. One prisoner was confirmed and transferred to an outside hospital. At least 30 suspected cases of the disease were also reported. The prison tried to control the outbreak by turning off the plumbing and bring in portable toilets. There are a total of 3742 inmates at San Quentin.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], symptoms of legionnaires' disease resemble pneumonia and can include cough shortness of breath, high fever, muscle aches and headaches. CDC says people get sick by breathing in mist or vapor containing the bacteria. Legionnaires' [disease] is not spread person-to-person and is effectively treated with antibiotics.

While legionnaires' disease doesn't seem very common, there have been several cases this year alone [2015], including outbreaks at a New York Hotel [the source of the outbreak in New York City was a South Bronx hotel cooling tower, but did not involve guests at the hotel. - Mod.ML] and an Illinois veterans' home. Two deaths are also blamed on the illness in Canada.

[There is some confusion about the number of inmates at San Quentin Prison with confirmed legionnaires' disease.

On 29 Aug 2015, ProMED-mail reported that 1 inmate with confirmed legionnaires' disease and 2 inmates with suspected legionnaires' disease were hospitalized, and an additional 30 others were under observation at San Quentin prison in Marin County, California, north of San Francisco (ProMED-mail post Legionellosis - USA (11): (NY, CA, IL) RFI 20150829.3610573).

A 2nd ProMED-mail post reported a week later that there were 6 inmates at San Quentin State Prison with confirmed legionnaires' disease, who were being treated at the medical unit on site (ProMED-mail post Legionellosis - USA (14): (IL,CA) fatal, veterans home, prison, update, RFI 20150905.3625315). The source of the outbreak was not known at the time. We are now told in the news report above that only 1 prisoner had confirmed legionnaires' disease, and that prisoner was transferred to an outside hospital.

We are also now told that cooling towers may be to blame for the outbreak, but we are not told how this was determined. Was genotyping done and if so, did isolates from the cooling towers match clinical isolates? More information on this outbreak would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.ML
