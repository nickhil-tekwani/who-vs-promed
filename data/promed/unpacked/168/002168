Argentina. Plant Dis. 89:684, 2005; published on-line as DOI:
10.1094/PD-89-0684B. Accepted for publication 16 Mar 2005.
The Asian soybean rust caused by the fungus _Phakopsora pachyrhizi_ was
cited for the 1st time in Argentina during the 2002-2003 growing season
(3). During 2003-2004, the disease spread to other northern provinces and
was also observed in north-central Santa Fe, the main soybean-producing
province of the country. Because the disease appeared at the end of the
crop growing season (late March to early April) it had little or no impact
on crop yields.
The objectives of this study were to characterize morphologically and
pathometrically the disease on soybean and check the presence of _P.
pachyrhizi_ on volunteer soybean plants that could eventually carry the
disease to the next growing season. The study was conducted in the San
Justo Department, Santa Fe Province (between 30 and 31S latitude), where
the presence of the soybean rust was molecularly confirmed by Sistema
Nacional Vigilancia y Monitoreo (on-line publication at
<http://www.sinavimo.gov.ar>).
3 field locations were sampled and identified as M1, M2, and M3.
Transversal cuts of soybean leaves through rust lesions and
histopathological staining were used for micromorphologic characterization
of the developmental stages of _P. pachyrhizi_. The disease incidence was
estimated as the proportion of affected soybean plants and leaves. Average
severity, expressed as the percentage of leaf area affected, including
chlorosis, was measured on the terminal leaflet of leaves sampled from the
lower one-third of the canopy. 3 replicates of 10 plants, randomly chosen,
were used. The number of uredinia per square centimeter and per lesion
(symptomatic foliar area showing chlorosis and necrosis caused by the
fungus) was measured on the undersides of the sampled leaflets at 40x
magnification (1).
Typical signs and symptoms of _P. pachyrhizi_ coexisted on soybean leaves
with brown spot (_Septoria glycines_), downy mildew (_Peronospora
manshurica_), anthracnose (_Colletotrichum truncatum_), and blight and leaf
spot (_Cercospora kikuchii_) and also with bacteria (_Pseudomonas_ and
_Xanthomonas_ spp.). Uredinia and telia of the _P. pachyrhizi_ cycle were
observed. Uredinia were also observed on soybean petioles.
The average size of urediniospores (n = 60) was 23.3 x 16.6 micrometers.
Telia were located adjacent to the uredinia. These telia were dark and
crusty with 4 stacked layers of teliospores. Rust incidence in plants was
100 percent for the 3 fields, while the incidence in leaves was 100 percent
for M1 and M2 and 60 percent for M3. Average disease severity was 50.3,
25.6, and 14.8 percent for M1, M2, and M3, respectively. The mean number of
uredinia per square centimeter was 327, 179, and 177, for M1, M2, and M3,
respectively. The number of uredinia per lesion ranged from 1 to 6. _P.
pachyrhizi_ was also found on volunteer soybean plants that emerged shortly
after harvest. On 40 leaflets, the foliar incidence was 25 percent, showing
1-2 lesions with 1-2 uredinios per leaflet (2).
The volunteer soybean plants could constitute a potential early source of
inoculum.

[This piece gives a short, but comprehensive, outline of the Asian strain
at that time (2003-2004). However, I suggest that use of the word
"urediniospores" be used instead of "uredinios" to describe the asexual spores.
