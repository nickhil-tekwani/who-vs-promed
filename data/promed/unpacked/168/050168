[It has now been 25 days since the last report of a locally transmitted case in Wuhan, 11 days more than one incubation period (an outbreak is usually declared over/transmission declared interrupted after 2 incubation periods without newly confirmed cases). In today's (28 Apr 2020) report, there was 1 new locally transmitted infection in Guangdong reported. With an additional 21 imported cases, the total number of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours is 22. There are 2 suspected cases in importations (1 in Inner Mongolia, the other in Shanghai). It has now been 35 days since restrictions were lifted in Guangdong and Heilongjiang, and it appears as though low level local transmission has been established in both Heilongjiang and Guangdong over the past 22 days or so, albeit the number of reported cases from both Guangdong and Heilongjiang are decreasing.

According to the report above, a total of 82 858 cases of confirmed COVID-19 have now been reported from mainland China, including 4633 deaths, representing an increase of 22 cases mentioned above, in the 24 hours since yesterday's (27 Apr 2020) report. In Hong Kong, where numbers of newly confirmed cases had been reported daily, there were no newly confirmed cases reported in the past 72 hours. And Macau has reported no newly confirmed cases.

As best as I can decipher from the machine-translated report above, there were 26 newly confirmed infections in asymptomatic people in the past 24 hours, 5 were in imported cases. There was one conversion from asymptomatic to symptomatic in the past 24 hours. The total number of asymptomatic individuals currently under observation (and isolation) is 993, and 131 of these are importations from abroad. It would be helpful to know what proportion of asymptomatic infected individuals went on to be symptomatic to start developing projections of actual infection rates and adjust reported case fatality ratios accordingly. It is apparent that there is most likely thorough contact tracing and testing to explain the daily reports of asymptomatic infections in addition to the screening of individuals arriving from overseas.

As reported on 24 Mar 2020, China ended the lockdown in Hubei and elsewhere, and ended it in Wuhan on 7 Apr 2020. There is much caution and skepticism in the media over the reality of the zero case reports. The world is watching carefully to see whether this is safe timing. There do appear to be chains of transmission ongoing in Guangdong (perhaps approaching interruption) and Heilongjiang that are of concern, but clearly the most concerning are the imported cases returning to China.

[The tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy is now 201 505 cases, including 27 359 deaths, up from 199 414 cases and 26 977 deaths reported on 27 Apr 2020. The 24-hour change between 27 and 28 Apr 2020 was 2091 newly confirmed cases, compared with 1739 newly confirmed cases between 26 Apr 2020 and 27 Apr 2020. The increase noted may be a post weekend catch up phenomenon. The numbers of hospitalized cases and cases in the ICU are experiencing a decline. Cases continue to be concentrated in the northern part of the country, in Lombardy, the epicenter of the outbreak, Emilia-Romagna, Veneto, and Piedmont. These 4 provinces combined account for 76.6% of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. Lombardy is the main contributor, representing 41.6% of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. In addition to Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna, Veneto, and Piedmont, 1 other province (Liguria) has reported more than 100 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. 1 province reported no new cases, 6 provinces reported less than 10 newly confirmed cases, and another 7 provinces reported less than 50 newly confirmed cases, all signs of decreasing local transmission.

There is an excellent interactive map at http://opendatadpc.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/b0c68bce2cce478eaac82fe38d4138b1 to visualize the caseloads per region in near real time.

On 9 Mar 2020, Italy announced a lockdown for the northern provinces, where the outbreak was concentrated. On 10 Mar 2020, this was expanded to be countrywide. On 11 Mar 2020, Italy announced the closure of non-essential businesses. It is now 38 days since the start of the lockdown in the north and 36 days since the countrywide lockdown. The lockdown is being extended until 3 May 2020 (see ProMED-mail post 20200411.7211958 for details). All eyes will be on Italy as lockdown restrictions are phased out.

[4] Iran: 92 584 total cases, 5877 deaths

Iranians should be cautious but not afraid of the coronavirus [SARS-CoV-2], President Hassan Rouhani said on Tuesday [28 Apr 2020] as the country eases restrictions in an attempt to return to normal life. Iran is one of the Middle Eastern countries hardest hit by the outbreak of the new coronavirus. "Excessive fear, excessive anxiety, excessive worrying is worse than this corona itself and this virus and can really break up people's lives and take away people's comfort," Rouhani said, according to the official presidency website.

"But at the same time we shouldn't be careless, meaning there must not be excessive anxiety and worrying and there must be necessary caution." Iranians have returned to shops, bazaars and parks over the past week as the country eases coronavirus restrictions, with the daily increase in the death toll below 100 since [14 Apr 2020].

The death toll in Iran from the coronavirus pandemic rose by 71 in the past 24 hours to 5877, health ministry spokesman Kianush Jahanpur said on state TV on Tuesday [28 Apr 2020]. The total number of diagnosed cases of the new coronavirus in Iran has reached 92 584, he said.

Seeking a balance between protecting public health and shielding an economy already battered by sanctions, the government has refrained from imposing the kind of wholesale lockdowns on cities seen in many other countries. Health officials have warned that the easing of restrictions could lead to a new wave of infections and state TV in recent days has featured interviews where people on the street are questioned why they are not using masks and gloves.

[In the 24 hours from 27 to 28 Apr 2020, the total number of cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Iran grew from 91 472 to 92 584, an increase of 1112 compared with 991 newly confirmed cases reported yesterday (27 Apr 2020). The number of deaths has also increased from 5806 to 5877, an increase of 71 deaths in the 24-hour period (as of 28 Apr 2020). In terms of total numbers of confirmed cases, Iran ranks 9th globally, behind the USA, Spain, Italy, France, Germany, UK, Turkey, and Russia, having surpassed China. As with other countries that are lifting business closures, all eyes are on Iran now that "low risk" businesses are opening.

[The above are the latest breakdowns of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the USA, as per Worldometer data. The total number of confirmed cases in the USA and territories is now 1 035 765, including 59 266 deaths, an increase from 1 010 356 cases and 56 797 deaths in the past 24 hours. New York state, with 301 450 (29.1%) cumulative case reports and 3446 (13.6%) newly confirmed cases over the past 24 hours, is clearly the epicenter of the outbreak in the USA, although case reporting elsewhere is increasing. New York City had a cumulative total of 157 713 as of 2:00 PM on 28 Apr 2020, including 11 820 confirmed deaths and an additional 5395 probable deaths (https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data.page).

Daily reported case counts are high in New Jersey (2668 -- 10.5% of total), Illinois (2219 -- 8.7%), Pennsylvania (1861 -- 7.3%), Massachusetts (1840 -- 7.2%), California (1157 -- 4.6%), and Michigan (1052 -- 4.1%). In terms of cumulative case reports, New York is number one, followed by New Jersey, Massachusetts, Illinois, California, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Florida, Louisiana, and Connecticut.

Repeating from yesterday (27 Apr 2020), more sobering, if you treat each state like a country and insert them in descending cumulative case counts, New York state would be number 1 followed by Spain, Italy, France, the UK, Germany, Turkey, New Jersey, Russia, and Iran as number 10. Number 11 would be China, 12 Brazil, 13 Massachusetts, 14 Canada, 13 Illinois, 14 Belgium, 15 California, 16 Pennsylvania, 17 Michigan, 18 Netherlands, 19 Florida, and 20 India. 8 US states are in the top 20 in terms of cumulative case counts (concept from - Mod.LXL).

The US military has confirmed 6648 cumulative cases, with 80 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. The Veteran Affairs reported 7481 cumulative cases and 480 new cases today (28 Apr 2020). There have been 1648 cases reported from federal prisons (272 new cases in the past 24 hours) and 1769 cases reported from the Navajo Nation (53 newly reported cases in the past 24 hours). Puerto Rico has reported 1400 cases (11 new cases in the past 24 hours).

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html) has a growth curve and a table giving demographics (age and ethnicity) where known.

[As per the WHO Situation Report 98 from 27 Apr 2020 (https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200427-sitrep-98-covid-19.pdf and in COVID-19 update (136): UK NHS increased testing, Brazil, WHO 20200428.7274496) Spain will be reporting only PCR positive confirmations and not antibody based, effective 25 Apr 2020. The antibody confirmed cases are shown in the graph accompanying Table 1, but tabular form showing data by province is not available. While the website for 27 Apr 2020 showed 210 733 cases, the Johns Hopkins CSSE data shows 232 128 cases reported for today, accessed at 1:59 PM EDT on 28 Apr 2020 (https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6)

That being said, Spain is 2nd globally in terms of the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19. There were 1308 newly confirmed cases by PCR (2706 new cases counting PCR and antibody testing) in the past 24 hours bringing the PCR confirmed cumulative total to 210 733 as compared with 209 465 PCR confirmed cases yesterday (27 Apr 2020).

As of today (27 Apr 2020) and as per the Spanish health webpage, 210 733 total cases and 23 822 deaths have been reported, up from 209 465 cases and 23 521 deaths in the preceding 24 hours (26 Apr 2020) (from Johns Hopkins CSSE 232 128 on 27 Apr 2020 vs 229 422 on 26 Apr 2020). The countrywide 2-week incidence per 100 000 population continues to decrease and is now 81.28, a continual slow decrease over the past 21 days from a high of 214.43 on 7 Apr 2020 to 81.28 today (28 Apr 2020). Spain has the highest case count in Europe and is 2nd globally behind the USA in terms of absolute numbers of cases. Figure 1 at the source URL above shows the daily confirmations juxtaposed with dates of onset of disease, and one clearly sees the trend for decreasing confirmations in recent times. There is also a clear growth curve showing the trajectory of the epidemic at https://covid19.isciii.es/; it is updated daily.

Of the 210 733 cases, approximately 114 959 (54.5% have been hospitalized (a major increase from 80 150 in the past 48 hours) and 10 437 (5.0%) admitted to the ICU (there is a note mentioning that some of the communities are providing daily prevalence data, hence my use of "approximately" for hospitalization and ICU data). Caution should be taken in interpreting this rise due to the decreased denominator.

A map of Spain showing provinces (autonomous communities) can be seen at https://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/map/spain-administrative-map.htm and a HealthMap/ProMED-mail map at https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=7278751,43. Madrid, Catalonia, and Castile and Leon are now the most affected communities by population-based rates. Castile and Leon is located in the northern part of the country and Catalonia in the north east. Madrid is located in central Spain, with Castile and Leon to its northwest and Catalonia to its northeast. - Mod.MPP]
