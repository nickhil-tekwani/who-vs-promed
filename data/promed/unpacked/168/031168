Outbreak update: Since the last brief [7 Jul 2020], 1 419 904 new confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases and 34 3262 new deaths have been reported globally. To date, a total of 12 786 051 COVID-19 cases and 566 904 related deaths (case fatality rate [CFR]: 4%) have been reported from 215 countries and territories. No new country or territory is reporting cases or deaths for the first time this week. The distribution of cumulative cases (proportion of global cases %) from the World Health Organization (WHO) reporting regions (excluding Africa) are as follows: Eastern Mediterranean Region 1 167 859 (9%), European Region 2 925 686 (23%), Region of the Americas 6 669 879 (52%), South-East Asia Region 1 163 556 (9%), and Western Pacific Region 244 960 (2%). For more detailed information on cases and deaths being reported outside of Africa, refer to the WHO daily situation reports.

As of 9 am EAT [East African Time, UTC +3] [14 Jul 2020], a total of 610 807 COVID-19 cases and 13 456 (CFR: 2%) deaths have been reported in 54 African countries. This is 5% of all cases reported globally. Since the last brief (2020), 118 183 new COVID-19 cases have been reported, which is a 24% increase compared to the [7 Jul 2020] report. The proportion of new COVID-19 cases reported by region is as follows: Southern region 72% (84 628), Northern region 11% (12 646), Western region 10% (12 038), Eastern region 6% (6246), and Central region 2% (2625).

[The current data reported from Africa as of 15 Jul 2020 has 645 591 cases, 14 067 deaths, and 335 831 recoveries (https://africacdc.org/covid-19/). At this weblink, there is a graphic presentation of the pandemic in Africa as well as country specific bar graphs that are very telling. The Southern region (comprised of South Africa, Malawi, Zambia, Eswatini/Swaziland, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Botswana, Lesotho, and Angola), most notably South Africa, has the highest toll in terms of reported cases and deaths. The next most affected region is the Northern region (Egypt, Algeria, Morocco, Mauritania, Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic, Tunisia, and Libya) with Egypt reporting the highest number of cases, followed by Algeria and Morocco. Next is the Western region (Nigeria, Ghana, Cote d'Ivoire, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Gambia, Liberia, Guinea, Togo, Benin, Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger, and Guinea-Bissau) significantly lower than the Southern and Northern region in terms of absolute case numbers with Nigeria reported the highest number of cases followed by Ghana and Cote d'Ivoire. Following West Africa, is the East Africa region (Kenya, Ethiopia, Sudan, Eritrea, South Sudan, Uganda, Tanzania, Somalia, Rwanda, and Madagascar) with Kenya, Ethiopia, and Sudan showing prominence, but significantly fewer reported cases than other countries previously mentioned. And the fewest cases have been reported by the Central region (Cameroon, Congo DR, Republic of the Congo, Gabon, Equatorial Guinea, Central African Republic, Chad, and Burundi), with Cameroon and the Congo DR showing prominence.

[2] Selected countries
[A] China: National Health Commission, 83 622 total cases, 4634 deaths
[B] South Korea: 13 672 confirmed cases, 293 deaths
[C] Italy: 243 736 total cases, 35 017 deaths
[D] Iran: 267 061 total cases, 13 608 deaths
[E] USA: 3 695 025 total cases, 141 118 deaths

[These countries have been selected based on having had significant surges with SARS-CoV-2 infections, but different responses. In some cases, transmission was almost interrupted, but resurgences have occurred, and countries have handled them differently. One observation is that lifting of restrictions has led to major resurgences in some areas; in others, early new threats seem to be importations, but community spread does recur. Good contact tracing has helped to shorten the time with new clusters, and temporary new restrictions have impacted. Countries not implementing restrictions have done more poorly with major resurgences. - Mod.MPP]

[There were 10 new confirmed cases in the past 24 hours -- 9 were imported and 1 was locally acquired. It is now 11 days with no new cases reported from Beijing.

There were 5 newly confirmed infections in asymptomatic individuals (4 imported) and no new conversions from asymptomatic to symptomatic in the past 24 hours. Since 18 May 2020, China has reported 37 cases of conversion from asymptomatic to symptomatic infection.

Hong Kong reported 67 new cases. The newly reported cases involve 34 males and 33 females aged between 4 and 94 years. Among them, 4 had travel history during the incubation period (https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202007/16/P2020071600800.htm ). Mandatory quarantine for all travelers entering Hong Kong in either government run quarantine centers or hotel rooms provided by the government. Electronic bracelets are placed on quarantined individuals. Any breach of quarantine (leaving the room) carries a fine of USD 25 000. The government is serious. The strict regulations were provided in: ProMED-mail. COVID-19 update (318): masks, meat plants, selected countries, WHO, global 20200716.7580042.

Takeaway message: China continues to have importations of infected individuals with SARS-CoV-2. Hong Kong is dealing with increased local transmission associated with the lifting of restrictions; new severe restrictions have been announced.

[In the past 24 hours, according to the report at the source URL, the tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea has increased by 60 cases with 2 new deaths, compared with 61 cases and 2 new deaths in the previous day (15 Jul 2020). The daily newly confirmed case count has been at or below 100 for 94 consecutive days. There were 21 locally transmitted cases: Seoul (7), Gyeonggi (5), Gwangju (5), Jeju (3), and Daejeon (1); and 39 imported cases: airport quarantine (25), Gyeonggi (10), Gyeongnam (2), and Seoul (2). There were 11 provinces reporting no newly confirmed cases (compared with 7 provinces yesterday, 15 Jul 2020).

Detailed updates on the 61 cases reported yesterday (15 Jul 2020) including information on clusters can be found in notices 437 and 438 at https://www.cdc.go.kr/board/board.es?mid=&bid=0030.

The overall impression hasn't changed. Lifting of measures has been accompanied by increases in locally acquired infections through increasing clusters related to gatherings of people at employment (bringing it outside employment to contacts) and in houses of worship, and bars and clubs. However, that being said, importations are also playing a major role in the country as well. With the increase in cases, in the past few days there have been increases in reported deaths.

[The tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy is up by +230 cases and +20 deaths in the past 24 hours. The previous day's (15 Jul 2020) 24-hour change was +162 cases and +13 deaths. The numbers of hospitalized cases and cases in intensive care units are still in a slow decline.

Cases still continue to be concentrated in Lombardy, the original epicenter of the outbreak (see tables at the link on the source URL to "download the latest data"). Lombardy again reported the largest number of newly confirmed cases in the 24-hour period (80); Emilia-Romagna (46), Veneto (29), Sicily (17), and Tuscany (12), are the other provinces reporting 10 or more cases A total of 16 provinces reported fewer than 10 newly confirmed cases (5 provinces reported no new cases). Italy is now 71 days post phase 2 initial opening up and 55 days post 2nd stage of phase 2 opening up. For more detailed information on the outbreak, I suggest going to the source URL above.

[The total number of confirmed cases in the USA and territories is now 3 695 025 including 141 118 deaths, an increase from 3 616 747 cases and 140 140 deaths in the past 24 hours. New York City had a cumulative total of 217 230 cases as of 13:00 EDT (GMT-4) on 16 Jul 2020 (+396 since 15 Jul 2020) including 18 754 (+46 since 15 Jul 2020) confirmed deaths and an additional 4617 probable deaths (https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data.page).

The top 10 states in terms of daily reported cases in descending order are Texas, Florida, California, Georgia, Arizona, Tennessee, Louisiana, North Carolina, Alabama, and South Carolina. The same 10 states as yesterday (15 Jul 2020), with just a slight change in order. This list includes states that are showing major increases in daily cases reported beginning with the lifting of restrictions around the end of May 2020. All of the top 10 states reported more than 1000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, with the range being 1838 to 15 053. In terms of cumulative case reports, the order is unchanged from previous days with New York as number one, followed by California, Florida, Texas, New Jersey, Illinois, Arizona, Georgia, Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania. A total of 44 states and entities have reported more than 10 000 cumulative cases each.

In the past 24 hours, the proportion of newly confirmed cases was 2.2%. The 7-day average of newly confirmed cases for the past 7 days is 24.1% higher than the 7-day average for the preceding 7 days, consistent with the ongoing pandemic in the country.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/covidview/index.html) has data on cases, hospitalization, testing, and epidemiologic variables such as age, race, ILI (influenza-like illness), surveillance, and emergency room visits, which are definitely worth reviewing, as a welcome series of analyses. According to the CDC data, as of 16 Jul 2020, the percentage of laboratory specimens testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 with a molecular assay remains at 9% out of 46 551 605 tests performed, consistent with the ongoing, not-yet-under-control pandemic in the country (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/testing-in-us.html).

*The situation report includes information provided by national authorities as of 10:00 CEST, 16 Jul 2020.

Highlights
----------
- 75 countries have submitted expressions of interest to protect their populations and those of other nations through joining the COVAX Facility, a mechanism designed to guarantee rapid, fair and equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines worldwide. The goal of COVAX is to deliver 2 billion doses of safe, effective vaccines that have passed regulatory approval and/or WHO prequalification.
- WHO and UNICEF have warned of a decline in vaccinations, due to disruptions in delivery caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. UNICEF executive director Henrietta Fore noted that "COVID-19 has made previously routine vaccination a daunting challenge" and stressed that further impact on vaccine coverage needs to be avoided, otherwise there is a risk of exchanging one crisis for another.
- While the world races to find a vaccine to defeat the COVID-19 pandemic, WHO looks back on all that vaccines have achieved for humanity.
- In today's 'Subject in Focus' we describe the WHO Unity Study protocols, developed to better understand the characteristics of the COVID-19 virus and the disease it causes.

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 215.

In the 24 hours since the last WHO update:

- The Americas region reported 58.7% of the global newly reported cases and 65.0% of newly reported deaths for this 24-hour period, maintaining its dominance as the most severely affected region, having reported more than 7 million cases. The USA reported 45.8% (60 711) of the newly confirmed cases in the region, and Brazil reported 31.5% (41 857), Mexico 5.3% (7051), Colombia 4.2% (5621), Peru 2.8% (3744), Argentina 2.7% (3645), and Chile 1.3% (1712).

- The European region reported 9.4% of the global newly reported cases and 9.9% of the newly confirmed deaths globally. Russia reported 30.3% (6428) of the regional newly confirmed cases, followed by Kazakhstan 7.9% (1674), Israel 7.4% (1573), Turkey 4.5% (947), Spain 4.1% (875), Ukraine 4.0% (848), France 3.6% (767), Romania 3.0% (641), Azerbaijan 2.6% (559), Armenia 2.6% (554), Germany 2.5% (534), Kyrgyzstan 2.5% (521), the UK 2.5% (538), Uzbekistan 2.3% (494), and Sweden 2.3 (491).

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 6.6% of the global newly reported cases and 8.6% of global newly reported fatalities. Saudi Arabia reported 18.0% (2671) of the regional newly reported cases, followed by Iran 16.1% (2388), Pakistan 14.5% (2145), Iraq 14.2% (2110), Oman 11.3% (1679), Egypt 6.2% (913), Kuwait 4.7% (703), Bahrain 3.3% (482), and Qatar 3.0% (450).

- The African region reported 7.6% of the global newly reported cases and 3.1% of newly reported fatalities. South Africa reported 73.8% (12 757) of the newly reported cases in the region in the past 24 hours, followed by Cameroon 5.1% (884), Nigeria 3.7% (643), Algeria 3.2% (554), Kenya 2.7% (461), Ghana 2.6% (442), Ethiopia 1.7 % (294), Madagascar 1.5% (262); Cote d'Ivoire reported no new cases.

- The Western Pacific region reported 1.0% of the global newly reported cases and 0.34% of global deaths. The Philippines reported 56.9% (1305) of the newly reported cases in the region, followed by Japan 16.6% (382), Singapore 10.8% (249), Australia 10.6% (244), South Korea 2.7% (61), and China 0.87% (20).

- The South East Asia region reported 16.8% of the global newly reported cases and 13.0% of global deaths. India reported 86.2% (32 695) of newly reported cases in the region, followed by Bangladesh 9.3% (3533), and Indonesia 4.0% (1522).

Impression: The overall picture is basically the same. The ordering of the regions has the Americas having the highest disease load and newly confirmed cases on a daily basis, followed by the South East Asia region, then Europe followed by the Eastern Mediterranean, followed by the Africa region and the Western Pacific representing the lowest daily caseload of all of the regions. The progression has been the initial "surge" in the Western Pacific region, followed by the surge in the European region and its decline, the entry and surging of the Americas region without any decrease, and the gradual and persistent increase in the South East Asia region, the increase then plateauing of the Eastern Mediterranean region, and the slow but steady increase in the Africa region.

[According to the data on the Worldometer website, the total number of reported cases of COVID-19 worldwide is now 13 946 170, with reports of cases by 217 countries and territories worldwide. It is highly likely that tomorrow (17 Jul 2020) the reported cumulative case count will pass 14 million cases. The global case count rose by 1.9% in the past 24 hours. The USA and Brazil are still the most severely affected countries in terms of cumulative case counts. In the past 24 hours though, the USA reported the most newly confirmed cases (78 278) followed by Brazil (43 829) and India (35 468). It is sobering to tally the total cumulative case counts for the top 5 countries (USA, Brazil, India, Russia, and Peru), and see that they represent over half of the total cases reported globally (57.2%). A global total of 592 673 deaths have been reported, an increase of 5897 deaths in the past 24 hours.

In descending rank order, the USA is number 1 for the number of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, followed by Brazil, India, South Africa, Colombia, Russia, Mexico, Peru, Argentina, and Bolivia. This is the 1st that Bolivia is on the top 10 list of daily reported cases. The other 9 countries are the same as yesterday (15 Jul 2020) (minus Bangladesh), in a slightly different order. All these countries are currently experiencing major community-based transmission and considered global hot spots. The range in the top 10 daily newly confirmed cases goes from 3289 to 78 278. The number of daily newly confirmed cases is climbing rapidly in the USA. Also worthy of note is that 7 out of the top 10 countries for daily reported newly confirmed cases are from the Americas region, consistent with the continued dominance of SARS-CoV-2 activity in this region.

Comparing the 7 day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, there is an increase of 11.1%, again consistent with the ongoing pandemic.
