PAEDERUS BEETLES - KENYA

Thanks to the excess rains in the country there has been a very significant
increase in _Paedrus crebinpunctatis_ and _.P. sabaeus_ beetles. They have
invaded houses, offices, and schools in Nairobi, and the Rift Valley and
Central provinces, as well as elsewhere in Kenya. The beetle, when
threatened, releases a powerful toxin, pederin, - the normal function of
which is to stop the beetle being consumed - and 12 to 24 hours later the
skin is inflamed, maybe blisters, and with symptoms of tickling to severe
burning. In the eye the tissue reaction can cause temporary blindness.
