Russian birds have H5N1
-----------------------
News services said today the avian influenza outbreak reported last week in
Russia involves the dangerous H5N1 strain.
A statement from Russia's Agriculture Ministry identified the flu outbreak
in poultry in the Novosibirsk region of Siberia as H5N1, according to the
Associated Press (AP).
"That raises the need for undertaking quarantine measures of the widest
scope," the AP quoted the ministry as saying.
If the report is accurate, the outbreak marks the 1st known appearance of
the H5N1 virus in Russia. The virus has been active in Southeast and East
Asia since late 2003, causing more than 100 human cases with more than 50
deaths in Vietnam, Thailand, Cambodia, and Indonesia.
The outbreak in southwestern Siberia was 1st reported last week. Late last
week, an official at a Russian disease research center identified the virus
as H5N2, which is less virulent than H5N1 and has infected humans. But in a
24 Jul 2005 report to the World Organization for Animal Health, Dr. Evgueny
A. Nepoklonov of the Ministry of Agriculture Moscow said the virus had been
identified only as an H5.
Earlier reports said the disease had killed hundreds of geese, ducks,
turkeys, and chickens in 9 villages. No human cases have been reported.
News of the Siberian outbreak comes about 2 months after the first reports
of an outbreak among migratory birds at the Qinghai Lake wildlife refuge in
northern China. World Health Organization (WHO) officials who visited the
site in June 2005 estimated that about 5000 birds had died. They worried
that birds leaving the refuge later this summer would spread the disease to
distant places.
2 reports published in scientific journals earlier in July 2005 seconded
that concern. A group of Chinese researchers writing in Science called
Qinghai Lake "a breeding center for migrant birds that congregate from
Southeast Asia, Siberia, Australia, and New Zealand." They said the
outbreak posed a risk that H5N1 could become a global threat.
In addition to the Qinghai Lake outbreak, 2 poultry outbreaks were reported
in June in China's northwestern province of Xinjiang, to the west of the
wildlife refuge.

[The above CIDRAP item provides useful complementary background. The
identification of H5N1, still to be officially confirmed and duly notified,
has also been reported on 30 Jul 2005 by the Russian newspaper Kommersant
(see <http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/L30334331.htm>). - Mod.AS]
