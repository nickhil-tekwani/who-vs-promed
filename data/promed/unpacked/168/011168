Foot and mouth disease modelling work - response to comments received
--------------------------------------------------
[When I posted Paul Sutmoller's critique of the Morris model [RS Morris et
al. Predictive spatial modelling of alternative control strategies for the
foot-and-mouth disease epidemic in Great Britain. Vet Rec 2001; 149(5):
137-44. <http://www.vetrecord.co.uk/abs481.htm>, I simultaneously copied
the critique to Roger Morris and John Wilesmith. Their response is as
follows. - Mod.MHJ
The comments we have received through ProMED-mail and other sources on our
analysis of control options for the foot and mouth disease (FMD) epidemic
in Britain (ProMED-mail V 2001, #183) have focused largely on the merits of
vaccination, and the way in which we used vaccination in the model. The
correspondents raise some useful issues, but miss the point of what we are
reporting in the paper.
The analyses were conducted over a relatively short period in late March
and repeated with an enhanced farms database in early April. They have been
reported exactly as they were conducted at the time, as a record of
predictions made early in the epidemic, not with any later adjustment for
the wisdom of hindsight. It was then a month into the epidemic, and
considerable controversy was raging about the feasibility and merits of
different control strategies. Our goal was to predict the scale and
duration of the epidemic under various control strategies that were under
consideration and others that were being promoted as superior alternatives
by various commentators.
At the time, it was apparent that the geographical distribution and scale
of the epidemic were both quite uncertain. With the hindsight provided by
epidemiological records of the epidemic, we now know that on March 27 the
number of known infected farms diagnosed as of that date in the epidemic
was 707. However, subsequent evidence shows that on that same date there
were 342 infected premises that had not yet been detected -- the highest
figure this indicator reached. Thus, any control strategies evaluated had
to take account of this uncertainty. The reality, as we now know (and as
"InterSpread" predicted), was that over half of all farms infected in the
epidemic by late August were already infected at the time the simulations
were run, and the expected benefit of control strategies at that date was
influenced within InterSpread by the evolution of the epidemic to that
point. Simulations were run for 200 days, because that was a reasonable
planning horizon at that stage of the epidemic, and realistic control
strategies achieved eradication within that time period.
Given what was known at the time, InterSpread predicted that, with the
control policy being applied, the epidemic would be about 1800 to 1900
farms and would be eradicated between July and October, with a low
probability of extending longer. Its predictions both at the national scale
and in later finer-scale analyses have proved to be remarkably close to
field reality. We intend to report some of these later results in future
papers.
Given the extremely wide spread of infected farms in late March and the
expectation that there were more yet to be discovered, classical ring
vaccination was not a feasible option. With the amount of vaccine and
number of vaccinators available for immediate use, a joint stamping
out/vaccination policy was evaluated in the 3 areas with the highest
concentration of infected farms, to damp down the epidemic in those areas
and prevent further outward spread. Because cattle were at the time still
indoors, and there was concern about the risk of transmission to cattle
from sheep when the cattle were put out to pasture, the decision was made
to evaluate cattle vaccination as a cost effective way of reducing further
transmission during the stamping-out process. The model predicted that this
would reduce the scale of the epidemic by under 100 premises. Vaccinating
sheep as well would have reduced this somewhat further. However, it was not
considered feasible at the time to provide sufficient vaccine and
vaccinators to achieve this quickly; and at best it could have had a modest
additional effect, for a very large effort.
There was considerable enthusiasm in some quarters at the time for
abandoning stamping out and simply vaccinating to control the disease. This
would have greatly lengthened the time before eradication could be
achieved; moreover it was considered that vaccination alone was not a
realistic control option. However, it was decided to include vaccination in
order to answer those who saw it as a panacea. The problem then was how to
allocate vaccine on the scale realistically achievable in the short term,
if stamping out was to be abandoned. The decision was made to use it to
shield the main uninfected areas from the known foci, so that if possible
the disease would not spread through the whole country. The vaccination
bands were therefore drawn up to protect what were then free areas, and to
focus the available vaccine on cattle, given that the country was under a
movement standstill and the benefit per dose should be higher from
investing it on cattle. The bands were approximately 20 km wide, so they
were significant barriers. They were certainly equivalent to the diameter
of the mandatory surveillance zones that form the basis for delineating the
formal "infected areas".
Many different "vaccination only" scenarios were possible, but we would
challenge the critics to come up with a strategy that would be
substantially better than the one tested, with the scale of vaccination we
believed at the time was feasible immediately. Our experience elsewhere in
the world would certainly endorse the merits of blanket vaccination and
extension to other species, but that was seen as impractical at the time,
and as greatly extending the expected time to achieve FMD-free status
again, compared with stamping out. It is believed that the modelling work
done was a valuable guide to the relative merits of the options then
available and being discussed, and the InterSpread model has certainly
proved very usefully predictive then and since.
Finally, we stress that we are not opposed to vaccination, but were trying
to identify epidemiologically sound strategies to deal with an
exceptionally diffused epidemic. Vaccination is clearly a valuable element
of many FMD control strategies, but it is not a panacea, and the debate on
this issue in the context of the current British epidemic needs to take
full account of the facts of the situation in late March, when options were
being evaluated.

[We are grateful to Roger and his coauthors for their reply. An informed
colleague working in the field in the UK made the following comment to me:
Whilst Dr Sutmoller's comments may well be correct in the different
possible vaccination strategies, it should be pointed out that evidence to
date does not indicate either "smoldering" infection in the national sheep
flock or infection in deer. All tests of deer to date are reported as
negative. It seems most likely that early reports of mortality in deer were
describing malignant catarrhal fever. In Wales it seems most probable that
the infection got onto the Brecon Beacons from neighbouring lowland sheep;
this is certainly the case in the few cases where sheep on common land have
been found with infection in Cumbria. There have been quite a number of
blood tests of fell sheep in Cumbria from the beginning of the outbreak,
and all have been negative, except where the sheep had either been brought
in close to the farm buildings recently [and therefore in proximity to
other stock, or where disease has run up against the common land in
lowland cattle or sheep. The implication in Dr Sutmoller's e-mail that the
disease is running through sheep and spilling over into cattle from there
is not currently the case in the area I am working in; most transmission
has been cattle-to-cattle with significant sheep involvement only when the
disease has reached predominantly sheep areas. Clearly this predominantly
ovine FMD epidemic is teaching us many new facts about an old disease, for
which the collective experience has been very largely with bovine and
porcine FMD. - Mod.MHJ
