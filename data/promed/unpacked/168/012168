Massachusetts: Eastern Equine Encephalitis Spreads to more Communities
----------------------------------------------------------------------
A month after it claimed the lives of 2 people, eastern equine
encephalitis (EEE) has spread to 14 southeastern Massachusetts
communities and been linked to the death of a 2nd horse. Brain tissue
from a Belgian draft horse that had been euthanized in Middleboro
tested positive this week for EEE, said Ralph Timperi, Director of
the State Laboratory Institute.
The virus that causes the disease also has been found in mosquitoes
in Attleboro, Brockton, Dartmouth, Easton, Halifax, Kingston, New
Bedford, Norton, Pembroke, Raynham, Walpole and, most recently,
Holbrook on 31 Aug 2004 and Rockland on 4 Sep 2004, Timperi said.
"Certainly, there's a risk to humans -- not a significant risk, but
this is a very serious disease, so we want people to take
precautions," he said, "not just in the towns where it's been
isolated, but in every community."
Last month, a 64-year-old woman, a resident of Brockton, and a
13-year-old boy of Holbrook died of EEE, which has symptoms that
include high fever, stiff neck, headache and lethargy. The virus
[multiplies] in birds that live in freshwater swamps and is spread by
the mosquitoes that feed off them. Health officials recommend wearing
long sleeves and pants and using insect repellent.
