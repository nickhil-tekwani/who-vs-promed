Researchers today [16 Dec 2013] reported that dromedary camels on a farm in Qatar were infected with a strain of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) nearly identical to that found in 2 people associated with the farm. The findings point to an outbreak that involved both camels and humans, but they don't answer the key question of whether camels infected humans or the other way around.

Qatari health officials announced on 27 Nov 2013 that the virus had been found in camels on the farm. Today's [16 Dec 2013] report in the Lancet Infectious Diseases spells out the science behind the announcement and says the findings mark the 1st definitive confirmation of the virus in camels.

The research team, involving Dutch, Qatari, and British scientists, said the nucleotide sequences of 2 genomic fragments from the camel and human viruses were very similar but not identical. The similarity is close enough so that researchers couldn't tell whether the camels or the humans were infected first. "We cannot conclude whether the people on the farm were infected by the camels or vice versa, or if a third source was responsible," the report says.

The results are the latest chapter in the quest to identify the source of the virus and how it is getting into humans. In previous studies, scientists reported MERS-CoV-like antibodies in camels in Oman, Egypt, the Canary Islands, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia, but not the virus itself. More than a month ago, on 11 Nov 2013, Saudi Arabian officials said the virus had been detected in a camel linked to a human case in Jeddah, but they have not yet published a scientific report on the discovery. The 2 human MERS cases associated with the Qatari farm were detected in October 2013. The first case involved the farm's 61 year old owner, who had contact with camels, sheep, pigeons, and hens at the site, the Lancet report notes. The second case, which surfaced a few days after the 1st, was in a 23 year old man who worked on the farm. Qatari authorities, with help from the World Health Organization, did an epidemiologic investigation at the farm within a week after the first case, taking nasal and rectal swabs and blood samples from all 14 camels there on 17 Oct 2013, according to the report. Five camels tested positive by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on 3 different gene segments, according to the report. In further PCR testing, which targeted the MERS-CoV spike gene, 3 of these camels were positive for the virus. The tested spike gene segments were sequenced and found identical in all 3 samples.

In further efforts, the researchers sequenced 6 gene fragments from one of the 3 camels. A phylogenetic analysis of the sequences revealed that the camel sample closely resembled the strains from 2 human cases linked to the farm and a human case reported at Hafr-Al Batin, Saudi Arabia in June 2013.

In other results, they found that all 14 camels had MERS-CoV antibodies, which suggested that the virus might have been circulating in the animals for a considerable time. The authors say 6 of the camels were positive for the virus at 2 different PCR targets, which is an internationally recommended standard for confirmation. The sequencing results, they add, increase the level of certainty. "Our results suggest a widespread and recent outbreak in this herd, coinciding with infection in 2 people," they wrote. "Our data should not be taken as evidence for infection of people from the camels," they added.

The sequencing results showed that the camel and human findings were "very similar, but distinct." Also, the camel and human samples were analyzed in separate laboratories in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. They said, further, that the sequence difference between the human and camel samples from the farm "is so small that we cannot conclude whether the people on the farm were infected by the camels or vice versa. Another possibility is that people and camels were infected from a third as yet unknown source."

"The most important unknown is the exact timing of infections, both in the infected people and in camels," the researchers said. They added that further sequencing probably will not provide conclusive evidence as to which species was infected 1st, but they are working on a more detailed analysis of the outbreak, including testing of more animals and efforts to obtain complete MERS-CoV genomes.

In an accompanying commentary, Neil M Ferguson and Maria D Van Kerhove, both of Imperial College London, wrote that the close similarity between the human and camel isolates "strongly suggests cross-species transmission, but present data do not inform on the direction of that transmission." They comment that "the slow rate of growth of the underlying epidemic, whether in camels, human beings, or other reservoir species" represents "a particular paradox." Environmental contamination is one possibility that may explain "the persistence of MERS-CoV in the absence of an explosive epidemic."

Ferguson and Van Kerkhove observe that the virus can spread from person to person, but whether it can achieve sustained transmission is still unknown. "If self-sustained transmission is not yet underway, intensive control and risk-reduction measures targeting affected animal species and their handlers might eliminate the virus from the human population," they wrote. "Conversely, if zoonotic exposure causes only a small fraction of human infections, then even intensive veterinary control efforts would have little effect on cases in people."

Ferguson and Van Kerkhove praise Qatar for doing "an exemplary integrated outbreak investigation," adding: "The handling of the outbreak reported here is a model that we hope is more widely adopted in the future."

[The above report is based on the paper entitled: Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus in dromedary camels: an outbreak investigation. Bart L Haagmans and others. The Lancet Infectious Diseases, early online publication, 17 Dec 2013 doi:10.1016/S1473-3099(13)70690-X. The following is the abstract of this paper:

"Background
----------
Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) causes severe lower respiratory tract infection in people. Previous studies suggested dromedary camels were a reservoir for this virus. We tested for the presence of MERS-CoV in dromedary camels from a farm in Qatar linked to 2 human cases of the infection in October 2013.

Methods
-------
We took nose swabs, rectal swabs, and blood samples from all camels on the Qatari farm. We tested swabs with RT-PCR, with amplification targeting the E gene (upE), nucleocapsid (N) gene, and open reading frame (ORF) 1a. PCR positive samples were tested by different MERS-CoV specific PCRs, and obtained sequences were used for phylogentic analysis together with sequences from the linked human cases and other human cases. We tested serum samples from the camels for IgG immunofluorescence assay, protein microarray, and virus neutralisation assay.

Findings
--------
We obtained samples from 14 camels on 17 Oct 2013. We detected MERS-CoV in nose swabs from 3 camels by 3 independent RT-PCRs and sequencing. The nucleotide sequence of an ORF1a fragment (940 nucleotides) and a 4Â·2 kb concatenated fragment were very similar to the MERS-CoV from 2 human cases on the same farm and a MERS-CoV isolate from Hafr-Al-Batin. Eight additional camel nose swabs were positive on one or more RT-PCRs but could not be confirmed by sequencing. All camels had MERS-CoV spike-binding antibodies that correlated well with the presence of neutralising antibodies to MERS-CoV.

Interpretation
--------------
Our study provides virological confirmation of MERS-CoV in camels and suggests a recent outbreak affecting both human beings and camels. We cannot conclude whether the people on the farm were infected by the camels or vice versa, or whether a third source was responsible."

In an accompanying analysis of these findings, Ferguson and Van Kerkhove conclude that "the virus can spread from person to person, but whether it can achieve sustained transmission is still unknown. "If self-sustained transmission is not yet under way, intensive control and risk-reduction measures targeting affected animal species and their handlers might eliminate the virus from the human population," they wrote. "Conversely, if zoonotic exposure causes only a small fraction of human infections, then even intensive veterinary control efforts would have little effect on cases in people."

The origin of the MERS-CoV outbreak in humans and camels remains unresolved. - Mod.CP
