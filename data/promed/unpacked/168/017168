The number of cases of measles in Colombia has climbed up to 11 in the past few hours, after 2 new cases were confirmed in San Onofre municipality, Sucre department

The affected persons are a 16-year old adolescent and a 4-year old girl who came from Venezuela a few days ago.

These patients will be examined until next May [2018], and healthcare authorities are currently running the appropriate protocol for taking care of this situation and they aim to determine whether there may be some more persons affected because of contact with these cases.

We have to remember that Colombia was declared a measles-free country (native cases) since 2015, but because of the health crisis due to lack of vaccines and drugs in its neighboring country (Venezuela), the virus came back.

The Colombian National Institute of Health (INS, according to its Spanish initials) has ruled out more than 1000 (suspicious) cases, but every week the number of infected persons is increasing.

Also, the recently reported cases show there is transmission occurring in young persons and in adults, which makes management more difficult, since as age increases, more complications may supervene.

There is also another case in San Onofre, a 22-year-old young man who is currently being treated. The Colombian government has emphasized that it is predictable that the numbers of cases may increase as long as in Venezuelan children are not vaccinated at an adequate age, which is between 8 and 15 months old, with a booster dose between 4 and 6 years of age.

[Americas: Measles outbreak fears amid Venezuelan refugee crisis -- update 1
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The World Health Organization (WHO) is on alert due to the reported regional spread of measles from Venezuela, where a major outbreak is underway, throughout the Americas. The region had been declared measles-free in 2016 but the disease has made a resurgence in Venezuela (notably the state of Bolívar), where the medical infrastructure has been severely degraded due to an ongoing politico-economic crisis. There are fears that the hundreds of thousands of Venezuelan refugees fleeing their country, notably towards neighboring Colombia and Brazil, will intensify the spread of the disease.

Since the beginning of the year (as of 20 Mar 2018), cases have been confirmed in 9 counties: Brazil, the US, Canada, Mexico, Peru, Antigua and Barbuda, Colombia, and Guatemala. The WHO is calling on these and other countries to fortify vaccination efforts.

Context
-------
According to humanitarian officials, an estimated 500 000 Venezuelans have fled the country since the beginning of the year [2018], with a large percentage taking refuge in Colombia and Brazil. The migrant crisis is expected to worsen throughout 2018 as Venezuela's economy continues to falter...

The measles virus claimed 2 more lives on [Fri 20 Apr 2018], while 26 children of a single tribe from Balochistan employed for the wheat harvest in Dadu district [Sindh] have been hospitalised. Official sources at Civil Hospital, Dadu said on [Sat 21 Apr 2018] that 3 of the 26 children are in critical condition.

The health authorities of Dadu were awakened to the situation on [Fri 20 Apr 2018] after the Baloch peasants staged a protest following the death of [a 1-year-old girl]. The local media [were told] that dozens of their children in their village of Duabo are displaying symptoms similar to those [the girl] displayed.

"We went to the local health authorities to request them to send a team to diagnose and treat our children but they didn't come until one of our children died," decried [a parent]. Dadu-based child protection unit in charge Naheed Qazi, who visited the village after media reports of the child's death, claimed that 8 children have so far died this year[2018] in the district while the contagion is relentlessly spreading. "The need is to fix responsibility on the doctors who in the 1st place failed to immunise the children against polio and those in the 2nd place who failed to provide the ill children timely medical treatment," she suggested.

A team of local doctors led by Dr Hameed Soomro and Allah Bux Korejo visited the village and shifted the 26 children to Civil Hospital, Dadu. The condition of 3 of the 26 children deteriorated on [Fri 20 Apr 2018] and the doctors suggested referring them to Peoples Medical University Hospital in Nawabshah [Sindh]. A total of 33 children sick with measles are admitted at the hospital.

Meanwhile, another child who was 18 months old, died in the Tando Adam town of Sanghar district [Sindh]. This is reportedly the 3rd death in the town in a week.

Earlier in January [2018], 6 children died within the span of a few days in Gorakh Town Colony in Johi taluka of Dadu district. The health authorities of Dadu had claimed that the officials or staff will face action if they were found negligent of duty in the inquiry. However, no action was taken despite the announcement.

Although measles-related deaths have been reported from all parts of Sindh, the virus has reportedly gripped the districts of upper Sindh more than those in the lower region of the province.

According to the World Health Organization's report, 5871 cases were reported in Pakistan in 2016. The figure almost doubled in 2017 to 10 540 cases. Laboratory tests confirmed that 2806 and 6437 cases were reported respectively during the 2 years.

Health practitioners point to incomplete coverage in the immunisation campaigns and a lack of efficient treatment facilities in rural areas as the cause of the virus's spread. 3 children died in Benazirabad district [Sindh] on 3 Mar 2018 and 5 were hospitalised after they were allegedly administered expired vials of anti-measles vaccinations.

Health authorities in Taiwan are on the alert as the number of patients with measles is at its highest level in 9 years.

The authorities say 22 people had tested positive for the highly infectious virus by [Sat 21 Apr 2018].

The virus is spreading among people who came into contact with a man in his 30s. His infection was confirmed during a visit to the southwestern Japanese prefecture of Okinawa last month [see Measles update (26): Europe, Pacific, Asia, USA 20180422.5761755 for a report on the outbreak in Okinawa, Japan].

At least 65 cases have been detected in Okinawa since the Taiwanese man's infection was discovered.

A flight attendant on board the plane with the man contracted the disease. Other patients in Taiwan include people who have travelled to Southeast Asia.

Taiwanese media report that about 5000 people may have come into contact with the measles patients.

Health officials say the number of cases is the highest since 2009, when 42 people were infected. They are urging people to see a doctor if they have symptoms.

Measles causes high fevers and rashes. It could be fatal for infants and toddlers and may result in miscarriages.

Japan's National Institute of Infectious Diseases says people will have immunity if they were vaccinated twice.

The institute is urging the public to check vaccination records as many people will be travelling during the spring holidays at the end of the month [April 2018].

Health officials in England are reporting an increase in measles cases in 2018, according to a Croyden Advertiser report. So far this year there have been 250 cases of measles reported (with at least 90 of those laboratory confirmed) in London -- compared to 243 reported in the capital for the whole of 2017.

The report notes while MMR [measles, mumps, rubella] vaccine uptake in London is good for the 1st dose, at 91 percent uptake by age 5, it falls to just 77% percent for the 2nd dose by age 5 -- the lowest of any region in the country.

Some London boroughs have an uptake of below 70 percent for the 2nd dose.

Measles is a highly infectious viral illness that can be very unpleasant and sometimes lead to serious complications. The measles virus is contained in the millions of tiny droplets that come out of the nose and mouth when an infected person coughs or sneezes.

The initial symptoms of measles develop around 10 days after you're infected.

These can include: cold-like symptoms, such as a runny nose, sneezing, and a cough, sore, red eyes that may be sensitive to light, a high temperature (fever), which may reach around 40 deg C (104 deg F), small greyish-white spots on the inside of the cheeks. A few days later, a red-brown blotchy rash will appear. This usually starts on the head or upper neck, before spreading outwards to the rest of the body.

Measles can be unpleasant, but will usually pass in about 7-10 days without causing any further problems.

Once you've had measles, your body builds up resistance (immunity) to the virus and it's highly unlikely you'll get it again.

However, measles can lead to serious and potentially life-threatening complications in some people. These include infections of the lungs (pneumonia) and brain (encephalitis).

Public Health England is urging people in Crawley [West Sussex] to make sure they are vaccinated against measles after an outbreak of the highly infectious viral illness in the town.

Members of the public are being advised to make sure they are vaccinated and up-to-date with 2 doses of MMR vaccine.

In the whole of 2017 there were 2 cases of measles reported in the Crawley, with only 1 in 2016, and so far in 2018 there have already been 2 cases reported.

Signs to look out for include cold-like symptoms, sore red eyes, a high temperature, or a red-brown blotchy rash.

Dr Yvonne Doyle, regional director for Public Health England, said: "We are seeing a concerning increase in measles cases across London which could lead to a wider outbreak in unvaccinated children and adults.

"We want people to know that it's never too late for them to have the MMR vaccine. Those who have not received 2 doses of the vaccine in the past -- or who are unsure -- should speak to their GP. There's no harm in receiving an additional dose where there is any uncertainty.

"Public Health England asks that parents -- and young adults -- remain alert to measles.

"Those experiencing symptoms should seek medical attention, but phone ahead before visiting GP surgeries so arrangements can be made to prevent others from being infected.

"It is crucial pregnant women have been vaccinated with MMR, as rubella in particular can cause serious complications during pregnancy.

The Department of Monitoring and Rapid Response of the National Centre for Disease Control said [Sun 22 Apr 2018] that it had recorded several cases of measles in Qatroun town, south of Libya.

In a statement, the Centre called on monitoring supervisors in the southern region to address school headmasters, local information officials, mosque preachers and healthcare managers to aware people of the disease and to guide them to the correct procedures if infected.

The Centre clarified that it would launch an urgent vaccination campaign in Qatroun, pointing out that any person who suffers a rash and a high fever should be isolated and suspended from school. It also urged citizens to take measles vaccine and vitamin A.

The Connecticut Department of Health (DPH) has confirmed 2 cases of measles in New Haven County on [Tue 24 Apr 2018]. The DPH reports that the 2 infected people are children under 12 months of age who reside in the same household and traveled internationally. Both babies acquired their infection outside of the country.

The DPH says that they are working to identify contacts and implement control measures. They were able to confirm that any exposures happened in New Haven County between 11 and 17 Apr 2018.

While measles is a highly contagious disease, the majority of people exposed are not at risk since most people have been vaccinated or have had measles in the past. "The single best way to protect yourself and your children from measles is to be vaccinated. While most people have had the measles vaccination, it's important to know your vaccination status and to be aware of the signs and symptoms of measles so you can get medical attention," said DPH Commissioner Dr Raul Pino in a press release.

Patrons of 2 chain restaurants in the Des Moines metro may have been exposed to measles, the Iowa Department of Public Health [IDPH] is warning.

The restaurants were visited by a confirmed measles patient from Missouri. Anyone who was at the same location was exposed to the highly contagious disease -- and needs to contact their doctor if they begin to show symptoms, the Iowa Department of Public Health says. [See the source URL above for a list of restaurants potentially contaminated by measles virus.]

"Since it is too late to prevent these exposed people from coming down with measles, they could become ill and start spreading the disease any day now," said IDPH Medical Director, Dr Patricia Quinlisk, in a news release. "That is why is it so important that anyone who has not received two doses of measles vaccine go in and get vaccinated today. That way if they are exposed in the next month or so when they go about their normal activities, they will be protected."

Kansas has had 18 confirmed cases of measles in several counties since 8 Mar 2018. Those cases have been traced back to a day care.

Missouri now has 4 confirmed cases of measles, all out of the Kansas City area.

The last confirmed case of measles in Iowa was in 2011.

In 2015, the United States experienced a large, multi-state measles outbreak linked to Disneyland in California.

Health officials declared 14 years ago, that measles in the United States had been wiped out. Science developed immunizations, and the immunizations were effective.

Then the anti-vaccine crowd got attention it didn't deserve and the outbreaks are now more common.

This week [week of 23 Apr 2018] in Wisconsin, authorities in La Crosse and Trempealeau counties and businesses in the area have to spend their time tracking down everyone who visited several locations [see source URL above for exact locations], because someone with measles had visited the area, the La Crosse Tribune reports today [23 Apr 2018].

The measles virus can remain in the air for 2 hours after a person leaves an area.

A year ago this month [April 2017], Minnesota's measles outbreak started with a 2-year old hospitalized child who hadn't been immunized. By the end of May, 65 cases were confirmed and the transmission didn't appear to be slowing down.

It eventually involved 5 schools, 12 child care centers, 3 health care facilities, and numerous households; an estimated 8250 persons were potentially exposed to measles in these settings, the CDC reported in a subsequent investigation.
