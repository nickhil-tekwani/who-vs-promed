-----------------------------------------------
Human:
During week 29, no new West Nile virus (WNV) cases of human illness
were reported to the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC). To date,
one probable human WNV case with Neurological Syndrome has been

Over the one week period from 17-23 July 2005, 7 new health units
[Ontario (5), and Manitoba (2)] reported dead birds positive for WNV.
Of the 391 dead birds tested, 11 (3 percent) were reported positive
for WNV within week 29. To date, positive dead birds have been
reported in 10 health units in Ontario (Halton, Hastings-Prince
Edward, Lambton, Middlesex-London, North Bay, Northwestern, City of
Ottawa, Peterborough, Thunder Bay, and Toronto), 6 health regions in
Manitoba (Winnipeg, North Eastman, Interlake, Brandon, Central and

[So far, this is the 1st CDC MMWR report on WNV for 2005. The WNV
season of this year [2005] seems to have started considerably later
than that of last year (2004), when its 1st report of outbreaks
appeared on 11 Jun 2004 and carried on until 19 Nov 2004 without any
breaks. - Mod.RY]

Tests find West Nile [virus] in 41 percent of mosquitoes, officials
urge continued precaution against bites
-----------------------------------------------
Mosquito monitoring continues to show an active presence of West Nile
virus in the bugs that can transmit the disease to people.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Mosquito Abatement and Rodent Control
District reported that 41 percent of the 156 samples of mosquitoes
submitted to the LSU [Louisiana State University] Vet School this
week [3rd week July 2005] tested positive for West Nile Virus. The
samples were collected between 12-19 Jul 2005 from 28 separate
locations throughout the parish.
2 sentinel chickens also tested positive for the bird virus. The
chickens are kept in cages to see whether infected mosquitoes bite
them. One of the sentinel chickens was from the Blackwater Road area
and one from the area of River Road near the Farr Park Horse Activity
Center.
The Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals reported that 6 dead
birds, which were collected from several different areas of East
Baton Rouge Parish between 20 Jun and 10 Jul 2005, also tested
positive for West Nile virus.
Birds act as reservoirs for the virus. Mosquitoes get infected by
biting and drawing the blood of birds and can then pass on the virus
to people or other mammals.
Most of the mosquitoes testing positive this week [3rd week July
2005] were southern house mosquitoes. "This mosquito bites at night
and likes to bite inside homes," said Matt Yates, director of the
control agency.
One sample of Asian tiger mosquitoes also tested positive, "and this
very aggressive mosquito species bites outdoors during the day."
Yates said.
Another mosquito species with no common name also tested positive; it
bites outdoors at night.
"So West Nile virus seems to be spreading from wild birds into other
mosquito species, and this further increases the potential for human
infections," Yates said.
The state has reported only 2 human cases of West Nile this year
[2005], both of them women from Livingston Parish.
Most people who get infected don't even know they are infected. Some
will suffer flu-like symptoms. One in 150 or so will develop
neuroinvasive disease and experience swelling of the brain, brain
lining or spinal cord, which can cause paralysis or death.
Residents should continue to take precautions to eliminate mosquito
breeding sources around their homes by dumping containers holding
water and protect themselves from mosquito bites when outdoors.
Another mosquito-borne disease, Eastern equine encephalitis, can
infect horses and humans, and a case was confirmed in a horse in
Livingston Parish earlier this week [3rd week July 2005], Yates said.
West Nile was 1st reported in the United States in New York in 1999.
It was 1st detected in East Baton Rouge Parish in 2002.
In 2004, there were 30 confirmed human cases of West Nile Virus in
East Baton Rouge Parish. 7 cases had dates of onset in July, 11 in
August, and 6 each in September and October 2004.
Yates recommends using repellents that contain DEET, picaridin or
lemon eucalyptus oil as the active ingredient.
To report a dead bird to the parish Health Department, call (225)
242-4870, or the control agency at (225) 356-3297.
