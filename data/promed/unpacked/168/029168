Two reports yesterday [26 Jan 2022] in The New England Journal of Medicine detail the effects of the COVID-19 vaccine booster on omicron (B.1.1.529) variant antibody levels, one finding that concentrations were 20 times higher after a 3rd Moderna vaccine dose than after the primary series, and the other showing the benefits of longer intervals between doses [see ProMED COVID-19 update (33): Moderna boosters, deaths, long COVID, WHO 20220128.8701120].

Led by researchers from the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, the 2nd study analyzed concentrations of binding and neutralizing antibodies against the wild-type strain and variants of concern elicited by receipt of 2 doses and a booster of either an inactivated COVID-19 vaccine (e.g., CoronaVac, BBIBP-CorV) or the ZF2001 protein subunit vaccine (https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2119426). These vaccines have been widely used in China and several other countries, the authors said.

Participants included COVID-19 survivors (convalescents) as well as those never infected with the virus. Those who received the ZF2001 vaccine were grouped according to the interval between the 2nd and booster doses: one group (short interval) received the 2nd primary dose one month after the 1st and the booster one month later, and the other group (long interval) received the 2nd primary dose one month after the 1st and then the booster 4 months after the 2nd.

The researchers used a pseudovirus to test the serum samples for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Reductions in the antibodies binding to the omicron variant were larger among both ZF2001 groups than among those who received the inactivated vaccine or the convalescent group.

Among convalescents, 15 of 16 serum samples were negative for neutralizing antibodies against the omicron variant, but antibodies in the sera of recipients of the inactivated vaccine and ZF2001 were still effective against omicron.

Among recipients of 3 vaccine doses, 10 of 16 samples (62%) in the inactivated-vaccine group, 9 of 16 samples (56%) in the short-interval ZF2001 group, and 16 of 16 samples (100%) in the prolonged-interval ZF2001 group had neutralizing antibodies against omicron.

In a 5th group of participants who also waited 4 months between the 2nd and 3rd ZF2001 dose but whose serum samples were collected 4-6 months after a 3rd dose, 9 of 13 (69%) had neutralizing antibodies against omicron.

Neutralizing antibody levels against omicron were 17.4-fold lower than those against the wild-type virus among convalescents, 5.1-fold lower in the inactivated-vaccine group, 10.6-fold lower in the short-interval ZF2001 group, and 3.1-fold lower in the prolonged-interval ZF2001 group. A longer interval between the 2nd primary COVID-19 vaccine dose and the booster also appeared to result in higher neutralizing antibody concentrations against all variants studied.

The authors said that the results support the use of multiple vaccine boosters and longer intervals between vaccine doses to protect against highly mutated variants such as omicron in both previously vaccinated people and those who had survived COVID-19.

"Our results are in accordance with those of previous studies involving messenger RNA vaccine recipients," the researchers concluded. "Next-generation vaccines that stimulate broad protection against SARS-CoV-2 variants are also needed."

[The CDC currently recommends 5 months between the 2nd dose of mRNA vaccines and the booster dose. Originally, the booster following Moderna vaccination was 6 months, but later it was shortened by the FDA to 5 months (https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2022/s0104-Pfizer-Booster.html and https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-shortens-interval-booster-dose-moderna-covid-19-vaccine-five-months). - Mod.LK]

[2] CIDRAP news scan
[A] Mix and match vaccines

Among 457 adult participants in an ongoing phase 1/2 clinical trial who completed primary COVID-19 vaccination with the Moderna, Johnson & Johnson (J&J), or Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines, a booster dose with either the same (homologous) or a different brand (heterologous) induced an immune response and was safe.

Baylor College of Medicine researchers led the open-label trial, published yesterday [26 Jan 2022] in The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) (https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2116414). Adults who had completed a COVID-19 vaccine regimen of 2 Moderna or Pfizer doses or one J&J dose at least 12 weeks earlier received a booster dose with one of the 3 vaccines at 10 US sites from 29 May 2021 to 13 Aug 2021.

Among the 457 participants, 154 received a booster dose with Moderna, 150 received J&J, and 153 were given Pfizer. Participants were followed for 29 days after receipt of the booster. The researchers said they plan to monitor vaccinees for one year to assess long-term immune response.

Regardless of whether participants received a homologous or heterologous ("mix and match") booster, neutralizing antibody concentrations against a SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus rose 4-fold, to 73, and binding levels increased 5-fold, to 55.

Homologous boosters increased neutralizing antibody levels 4-fold, to 20, and heterologous boosters increased levels 6-fold, to 73. Spike protein-specific T-cell responses rose in all participants except for those given a homologous J&J booster.

Concentrations of CD8+ T cells were most durable in those who received the J&J vaccine as their primary dose, and a heterologous J&J booster substantially increased spike-specific CD8+ T cells in those who completed primary vaccination with Moderna or Pfizer.

Adverse events were reported at levels similar to those observed in clinical trials of the primary vaccine series. More than half of participants said they had pain at the injection site, malaise, headache, or muscle pain, but no serious events were noted.

"These data suggest that an immune response will be generated for each of these vaccines used as a booster regardless of the primary COVID-19 vaccination regimen," the study authors wrote. "This speculation is supported by emerging data showing the effectiveness of the BNT162b2 [Pfizer] booster against symptomatic disease in the United States and against severe disease, hospitalization, or death in Israel."

[Only about 40% of Americans who are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 have received booster shots, CDC data indicate (https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations_vacc-total-admin-rate-total). This study supports the importance of being boosted. It indicates that whichever booster people get, they are protected to a greater extent than without a booster. - Mod.LK]

[B] Pulse oximeter readings

A UK study today [27 Jan 2022] shows pulse oximeter readings, which measure the level of oxygen in the blood, are an unreliable tool for gauging COVID-19 severity across different ethnic groups. The study was published in the European Respiratory Journal (https://erj.ersjournals.com/content/early/2022/01/20/13993003.03246-2021).

The study was based on electronic data from patients admitted to Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust from February 2020 to September 2021 with confirmed COVID-19 infection. Pulse oximetry measurements were compared to blood gas measurements taken within a 30-minute window.

Across all ethnicity groups, there were slight differences in readings between the oximeter and blood gas measurements, but patients of mixed ethnicity saw oximetry readings 7% higher than blood gas readings, the authors said, compared with just 3.2% for White patients. For Black patients, readings were 5.4% higher, and for Asian populations the readings were 5.1% higher.

"These mean differences were particularly marked in the clinically important range when the arterial blood gas demonstrated a true oxygen saturation of 85-89%," the authors wrote. The difference is attributed to pulse oximeters using light wave transmission to gather readings, which can be affected by skin pigmentation.

"This data builds on what we know, which is that patients with darker skin have less accurate oxygen measurements using the pulse oximeters," said senior study author Andrew Fogarty, MD, from Nottingham University in a press release (https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/941264). "Any error of measurement of oxygen levels will make assessing the severity of COVID-19 infection more difficult and may delay delivery of timely medical care."

A global total of 11 015 deaths were reported in the preceding 24 hours (late 25 Jan 2022 to late 26 Jan 2022). The exponential rise in cases over the last few weeks can be attributed to the rapid spread of the omicron variant globally. The 7-day averages indicate an increasing global trend for cases and deaths.

A total of 97 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 50 of the 97 countries are from the European region, 15 are from the Americas region, 16 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 6 are from the Western Pacific region, 6 from the South-East Asia region, and 4 are from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have increased by 7.9%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 18.1%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 21.8% decrease in daily reported cases and a 24.1% increase in reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily report counted over 3.62 million newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours with over 366.89 million cumulative reported cases and over 5.65 million reported deaths. Transmission continues at a very high level. - Mod.UBA]
