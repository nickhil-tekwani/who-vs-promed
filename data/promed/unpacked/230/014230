A few words about measles in Spain
----------------------------------
Routine immunization was introduced in 1978 as a single dose of monovalent
vaccine at age 9 months. In 1981, this was replaced by MMR [measles,
mumps, rubella triple vaccine] administered at age 15 months and 11 to 13
years. The second dose was advanced to age 3 to 6 years in 1999.
Vaccine coverage was 97 percent in 1990 and 94 percent in 2000.
129 884 cases were reported in 1940, 179 638 in 1975 and 145 322 in 1980.
The last major epidemic (220 109) was recorded in 1986. Disease incidence
then decreased to 21 650 cases in 1990, 8845 in 1995, 1842 in 1997 and only
446 cases in 1998. 136 cases were reported in 2001, of which 36 were
confirmed (11 of these imported cases).
A total of 130 fatal cases were reported during the period 1980 to 1994.

Number of cases of measles in Almeria increased to 77; 4 persons hospitalized
---------------------------------
Almeria: The death of a 33-year-old woman who developed measles during an
outbreak affecting the province of Almeria has lead to a major flow of
people to health centers requesting vaccination. Yesterday alone there
were 2261 persons vaccinated, raising to almost 4000 the total number of
vaccinations conducted as part of the campaign begun by the Andalucian
government.
Murcia, facing concerns that the outbreak will spread further in the
region, decided to mount the vaccination campaign in Almeria. Although
there still have not been any cases of measles reported in the community,
the Murcian government recommended vaccinations for persons who did not
have a history of measles in the past and were born between 1960 and 1978,
the period when the triple vaccine [MMR - measles, mumps, rubella vaccine -
Mod.MPP] was not included in routine vaccination schedules. The
recommendation is also extended to the immigrant population.
Since the identification of the outbreak several weeks ago, there have been
77 cases [of measles] identified, of which only 18 were confirmed
[presumably this refers to laboratory confirmation - Mod.MPP]. Yesterday
there were no new cases reported, but 3 of the 7 extant cases remained
hospitalized. The other 4 cases are stable but are expected to leave the
hospital shortly.
The chief of the Provincial Health Service, Tesifon Parron, insisted that
the death due to measles is an "exceptional" circumstance and reported that
"all infectious diseases, including the most common, such as the flu, can
always produce complications." In the case of the woman who died, measles
was complicated with a serious pneumonia, one of the more frequent problems
associated with the disease. [According to the Epidemiology and Prevention
of Vaccine-Preventable Diseases, The Pink Book, 7th Edition, Feb. 2003
approximately 6 percent of measles cases are complicated by
pneumonia. Pneumonia can be a viral giant-cell pneumonia or secondary
bacterial infection and is one of the more common causes of death
associated with measles infection.
