A Carbon County [Wyoming] man is dead after contracting the [a]
hantavirus last month [October 2011]. On Thursday [3 Oct 2011], his
name had not been released, but officials at the Wyoming Department of
Health said he was treated at the hospital in Laramie.

Only 9 cases of hantavirus [infections] have been reported in Wyoming
since 2000. Symptoms of the illness include severe muscle aches and
fatigue followed by difficulty breathing, headaches, dizziness,
chills, vomiting and diarrhea.

[The virus] is transmitted by rodent droppings and urine.

[There have been scattered cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome
(HPS) in the USA this year (2011), most in the western states.
Unfortunately, this report erroneously implies that there is "the"
(only one) hantavirus in North America that is capable of causing
human infection and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome. The virus most
likely involved in this case in Sin Nombre hantavirus, with the deer
mouse _Peromyscus maniculatus_ as its reservoir host.

An image of _Peromyscus maniculatus_, the rodent host of Sin Nombre
virus, can be accessed at
