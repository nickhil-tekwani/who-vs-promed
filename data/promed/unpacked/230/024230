A meningitis outbreak at the University of Maryland may be related to another virus that has swept across the country [USA] during recent months, though further testing is being conducted to determine the possibility. If the tests are positive, it would mean that yet another manifestation of enterovirus-68 has occurred. In Maryland, the state public health lab is conducting a broad range of testing on specimens submitted to the agency, state epidemiologist Dr. David Blythe says. Agency officials would not specify whether testing for EV-68 was occurring and did not confirm whether samples had been sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC]. County health officials say that testing will occur at either the state level or be performed by the CDC.

Five viral meningitis cases at the University of Maryland were confirmed as having been caused by an enterovirus, according to the University Health Center, and it's possible the EV-68 strain is causing the outbreak at the school, where more than 20 students have been infected. So far, only one instance of the specific meningitis-enterovirus-68 match has been confirmed recently in the U.S. In Connecticut, an elementary school student tested positive Thursday [30 Oct 2014] for both viral meningitis and EV-68. EV-68 symptoms have varied widely during the recent outbreak, from severe respiratory illness to paralysis and muscle weakness -- even resulting in one death. Latest figures from the CDC show that 1101 cases have been diagnosed in 47 states and the District of Columbia. Almost all cases have been among children, and the virus strain seems to particularly affect those with asthma or a history of wheezing.

The University of Maryland's health center had issued a statement about the viral meningitis cases, not wanting to cause alarm and hoping to avoid public confusion about bacterial meningitis, a much more serious condition that can result in hearing loss, seizures, brain damage and death. Bacterial meningitis is treated with antibiotics, and most colleges require students to be vaccinated against it before they are allowed to attend. Viral meningitis, on the other hand, can be treated with bed rest and water, along with medication to relieve fever and headache.

Though a range of viruses can cause viral meningitis, it is possible that EV-68 is one of them, says Dr. Robert Wergin, president of the American Academy of Family Physicians and a practicing physician in Nebraska.

For reasons that remain unclear, University of Maryland officials say they will not know the particular strain of enterovirus behind the meningitis cases for weeks, according to an email from the University Health Center. Viral meningitis can come from a range of infections, including the mumps, herpes, measles, influenza, or even West Nile virus, though most cases are caused by an enterovirus -- cases of which are typically seen throughout the fall and spring. A teacher and a student also were infected with viral meningitis at a public school in the District of Columbia, only 10 miles away from the University of Maryland campus in College Park, Maryland. It is unclear whether a transmission occurred between the 2 or whether an enterovirus was the cause of the cases in the district. Other individual cases of viral meningitis have been confirmed across the country. Last week, an elementary school student was diagnosed with the virus [a virus?] in Stillwater, Oklahoma. Another case was diagnosed in a student at Sam Houston State University in Texas. Public information about what virus caused the meningitis or whether additional tests had been conducted was not released in either case.

Symptoms of viral meningitis can last up to 10 days and include fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, sensitivity to light and a lack of appetite. People generally recover spontaneously with supportive care, Wergin says. But as an enterovirus spreads, it can [may?] get into the tissues of the brain and spinal cord, causing inflammation. In rare, more severe cases, patients might require hospitalisation. It's unusual for an otherwise healthy person who is college-age to get viral meningitis, Wergin says; typically, it occurs among children younger than 5. It makes sense, however, that people could be more at risk in an enclosed environment like a classroom or dorm, he says.

Comment on: Human enterovirus D68 - North America (14): genome sequence 20141029.2912217. Request for collaborators
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This ProMED-mail post reports on an investigation into sequence variation in the virus in an attempt to understand the epidemic potential and virulence of strains in the current outbreak. However, in addition to changes in the virus, rare human mutations affecting immunity to infection may be responsible for increased susceptibility to infections.

The laboratory of Dr. Jean-Laurent Casanova at Rockefeller University is devoted to the analysis of these kinds of mutations and has discovered numerous instances with increased susceptibility to a variety of organisms. They study cases and families in which unusual or unusually severe infections have occurred. Information thus far available (almost entirely from the news media) is limited. If confirmed by more complete investigation, the 3 fatal cases associated with enterovirus D68 in which the age and gender have been mentioned, fall into the category of unusually severe reactions to infection. One of these cases had concomitant _Staphylococcus aureus_ septicemia, a finding consistent with an immune defect that increased susceptibility both to the virus and to the bacterium. Dr. Casanova's laboratory would like to collaborate with groups that have access to specimens and families of patients who have died, with evidence of enterovirus D68 infection. CDC is aware of our efforts. Anyone with such access should contact me. All of the experimental work will be done in Casanova's laboratory.

An abstract outlining the general principles of the work follows. "Guidelines for genetic studies in single patients: lessons from primary immunodeficiencies" authored by Jean-Laurent Casanova, Mary Ellen Conley, Stephen J. Seligman, Laurent Abel, and Luigi D. Notarangelo, published in J Exp Med 2014 211:2137-2149. The Abstract states: "Can genetic and clinical findings made in a single patient be considered sufficient to establish a causal relationship between genotype and phenotype? We report that up to 49 of the 232 monogenic etiologies (21 percent) of human primary immunodeficiencies (PIDs) were initially reported in single patients. The ability to incriminate single-gene inborn errors in immunodeficient patients results from the relative ease in validating the disease-causing role of the genotype by in-depth mechanistic studies demonstrating the structural and functional consequences of the mutations using blood samples. The candidate genotype can be causally connected to a clinical phenotype using cellular (leukocytes) or molecular (plasma) substrates. The recent advent of next generation sequencing (NGS), with whole exome and whole genome sequencing, induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology, and gene editing technologies-including in particular the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 technology-offer new and exciting possibilities for the genetic exploration of single patients not only in hematology and immunology but also in other fields. We propose 3 criteria for deciding if the clinical and experimental data suffice to establish a causal relationship based on only one case. The patient's candidate genotype must not occur in individuals without the clinical phenotype. Experimental studies must indicate that the genetic variant impairs, destroys, or alters the expression or function of the gene product (or 2 genetic variants for compound heterozygosity). The causal relationship between the candidate genotype and the clinical phenotype must be confirmed via a relevant cellular phenotype, or by default via a relevant animal phenotype. When supported by satisfaction of rigorous criteria, the report of single patient-based discovery of Mendelian disorders should be encouraged, as it can provide the 1st step in the understanding of a group of human diseases, thereby revealing crucial pathways underlying physiological and pathological processes."

[The 1st report advances the proposition that human enterovirus D68 virus infection may be the principal determinant of (non-bacterial) meningitis. While this is an interesting proposition, no conclusive evidence is presented to support this contention. The commentary from Stephen J. Seligman seeks collaborators in a different molecular approach to analysis of enterovirus D68 genome function. This methodology has not so far been employed in the analysis of human enterovirus D68 genome function. Thus at present there is no definitive evidence that enterovirus D68 infection plays a major role in viral meningitis. - Mod.CP]
