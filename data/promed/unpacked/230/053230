The Bio Bio Department of Health confirmed 174 cases of salmonellosis in people who consumed homemade mayonnaise in the local "Dulce y Salado" ("Sweet and Salty") of Lota. This makes it the largest outbreak in the last 4 years at the national level and the largest outbreak in the Bío Bío Region. Among those affected are 25 hospitalized for severe dehydration, including a pregnant woman. There are also sufferers of all ages, such as a one-year-old baby and up to an adult older than 91.

According to the health authority, the number of patients should not increase substantially due to the number of days that have passed since the closure of the premises, on 3 Jan 2018. Now it is expected that laboratories in Santiago will determine the serotype of the strain, which may allow them to fully define whether the raw egg was responsible for this outbreak.

[The popular condiment mayonnaise is made from eggs (the likely source of the salmonellosis), lemon juice, salt and oil. A recipe (http://dish.allrecipes.com/making-mayonnaise/) is found below:

"Ingredients
----------
2 large eggs, at room temperature
2 teaspoons fresh squeezed lemon juice (or vinegar)
1 cup of neutral flavored oil (like light olive oil, grapeseed oil, walnut or sweet almond oil)
A pinch of good quality fine grain sea salt

'Tips for Successfully Making Mayo
- Use room temperature eggs. Cold eggs will often result in mayonnaise that does not thicken.
- Always add the lemon juice first. Lemon juice helps breakdown the protein in the egg yolks so they emulsify better.
- Start with a VERY slow stream of oil. A few drops at a time is best until you notice the mayonnaise starting to thicken. Once it has started to thicken you can pour the oil in a little quicker.
- Season the mayonnaise with good quality sea salt and add only a tiny pinch at a time. Mayonnaise can become too salty very easily.
- Only use fresh squeezed lemon juice. Bottled lemon juice will give your mayonnaise a funny flavor.
- Use good-quality, free-range eggs, because this condiment is made with raw eggs.

"Directions
---------
1) Gather all your ingredients together. I've found that a sturdy whisk works best and a bowl with high sides will help prevent splashes.
2) Separate the eggs. Save the egg whites for another purpose (like meringue) and place the egg yolks in a small bowl with high sides.
3) Pour the fresh lemon juice into the bowl with the egg yolks and whisk them well. Egg yolks contain a natural emulsifier, lecithin, which helps thicken sauces and bind ingredients.
4) Slowly, a few drops at a time, pour the oil into the bowl while whisking constantly. Once the mayonnaise has started to thicken, pour the oil in a slow and steady stream. If the oil starts to build up at all, stop pouring and whisk the mayonnaise briskly until the oil has incorporated.
5) If the mayonnaise starts looking too thick, add enough water to thin it to the consistency you like. Add about a teaspoon of water at a time.
6) Once all the oil has been mixed in, the mayonnaise should be thick and fluffy, with your whisk forming ribbons through the mixture. Season it carefully with fine grain sea salt. Add a small splash of water if you would like a thinner mayonnaise.

"Store your homemade mayonnaise in the fridge in a covered container for 3 days."

Lota is a city and commune located in the center of Chile on the Gulf of Arauco, in the southern Concepción Province of the Bio Bio (or Biobío) Region, 39 km south of Concepción and is one of the 10 cities (communes) that constitutes the Concepción metropolitan area. The city is mostly known for being the traditional center of coal mining in Chile, albeit mining ended in the 1990s. It can be found on a map at: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lota,_Chile. - Mod.LL
