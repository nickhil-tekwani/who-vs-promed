Outbreak of classical swine fever in Slovakia
---------------------------------------------
In Central European Slovakia a new outbreak of classical swine fever (CSF)
has been reported. The outbreak was reported in an area where also
professional production sites were struck by classical swine fever earlier
this year. LTO [Dutch Agri- and Horticultural Organisation] warns anyone to
be very careful when trading with Slovakia and Hungary as CSF is still not
completely under control there.

[A confirmation (with relevant epidemiological data) of the above
information, or otherwise, is required. In particular, it would be useful
to note if the event involved domestic (backyard?) pigs or wild boars.

Slovakia submitted to the OIE (Organisation Mondiale de la Sante Animale)
an "immediate notification" on 2 CSF outbreaks in commercial farms, on 17
Apr 2008; see, with map, at
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=6976>.
The discovery of the outbreaks led to the destruction of all 7176 pigs
present in one of the 2 affected farms; no explanation was given for the
different control policy implemented on the other farm with 13 332
susceptible animals, where stamping out was not applied. The reason for the
notification was said to be "reoccurrence of a listed disease"; the date of
the previous occurrence was indicated to be 2006.

The notification included the following concluding statement: "The event is
continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted."

According to OIE's WAHID data, 7 other European countries were reportedly
affected by CSF since January 2007, namely Bosnia and Herzegovina,
Bulgaria, Croatia, Former Yug. Rep. of Macedonia, Germany, Romania, Russia
and Serbia. No information for this disease was available from Hungary. -
