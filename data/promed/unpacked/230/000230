re: Viral gastroenteritis - Bulgaria (Samokov)
----------------------------------------------
If no (large or small) outbreaks of norovirus have previously been reported
from/in Bulgaria, then perhaps none have occurred there. If they have not,
then the levels of immunity in the general community may be presumed to be
very low indeed. If they are, that might explain, at least in part, the
seeming virulence of this outbreak, in which a large proportion of those
exposed to the virus succumbed to infection, assuming it was due to norovirus.
In contrast, an Irish expert has said that norovirus is now "like the
common cold in Ireland." Even if (strong) immunity only lasts some 3 months
following illness/infection, perhaps many of those exposed in this country
may show no signs of infection.
I believe that public hand washing leaves much to be desired in Ireland.
Perhaps Bulgaria is not much better? Perhaps no opportunity should be
missed to emphasise the importance of effective and appropriate hand
washing in general, even here?
The same applies to the report of the Christchurch (New Zealand)
international badminton tournament outbreak that was reported previously in
ProMED-mail [see:
Norovirus, badminton tournament (02) - New Zealand (South Island)
20070413.1237 and
Norovirus, badminton tournament - New Zealand (South Island) 20070410.1205]

[Another relevant factor is the now recognized genetic (and antigenic)
heterogeneity of noroviruses, which may be responsible for the appearance
of a novel outbreak in an apparently immune population. - Mod.CP]
