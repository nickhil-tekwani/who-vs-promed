Widespread suspected Norwalk virus outbreaks in Canadian hospitals
------------------------------------------------------------------
Hospitals across eastern and central Canada are struggling with a series of
[outbreaks] of highly contagious [viral gastroenteritis] that appear to be
caused by Norwalk virus. In Toronto, a suspected outbreak has forced the
closure of emergency departments at three Toronto-area hospitals: one in
Richmond Hill, one in Newmarket, and at York Central Hospital in the city
of Toronto. "This is the first time we've had to resort to closing the ER,"
says Frank Lussing of York Central, which has closed its emergency ward and
a cardiac unit to stop the virus from spreading beyond the 34 cases it's
already caused. Dr Richard Shabas at York Central Hospital says there's
been a higher than usual number of Norwalk-like virus cases this year. "I
think for reasons that no one really understands, there seems to be a lot
of activity this winter," he says.
Cases have also been reported at other hospitals across Ontario, including
hospitals in Ottawa, Hamilton, Brantford and Cambridge. In the
tourist-dense area of Niagara, the local public health department says
Norwalk virus is being blamed for 2 cases at long term care facilities.
In Charlottetown, the number of people who have contracted the
gastrointestinal virus has risen to 104. Prince Edward Island's chief
health officer Dr Lamont Sweet says the virus means some staff, all
volunteers, and visitors have been told to stay away from the Prince Edward
Home. In southern and western New Brunswick, children are being told not to
visit the River Valley Health Authority, which is trying to contain an
unknown virus that may be Norwalk virus. Children are being kept away from
the New Brunswick hospital because viruses tend to spread quickly when they
get into schools and day care.
Norwalk viruses spreads rapidly and causes severe vomiting, nausea, stomach
cramps, and diarrhea that lasts for a couple of days. Outbreaks of
Norwalk-like viruses are common in winter, particularly in confined places
such as nursing homes, cruise ships, and other venues where people are
gathered for several days or more. Laboratory diagnosis of Norwalk is
difficult, so diagnosis is often based on the observation of a combination
of symptoms and the short duration of the illness.
