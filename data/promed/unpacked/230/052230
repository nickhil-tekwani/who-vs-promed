An unvaccinated 9-year-old crossbred Belgian/Standardbred gelding in Crawford County has died after contracting West Nile virus -- the state's 1st confirmed case of the virus in a horse since 2018.

The disease can cause brain inflammation in horses and people, according to the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection (DATCP), which confirmed the case.

However, the virus cannot pass directly between people and horses -- the only route of transmission is from a mosquito bite, the DATCP says.

The Crawford County horse death is the only confirmed case -- human or equine -- in the state this year [2021], according to the state Department of Health Services.

Mosquitoes transmit the virus from birds, which are natural reservoirs for the West Nile virus. Because humans and equines acquire the virus from mosquitoes, the threat normally occurs when mosquitoes are most active, from mid-to-late summer until the first killing frost.

The 1st human cases in the Badger State occurred in 2002, when 52 people contracted the disease. Cases peaked at 57 in 2012 and have fallen precipitously since then, with only 4 reported in 2019, according to the DHS. But several other states have reported spikes in West Nile virus in recent weeks.

While most people infected with West Nile don't get symptoms, older people and those with weakened immune systems are more prone to diseases that can be fatal.

Health officials encourage residents to take standard precautions against mosquitoes to avoid becoming infected.

The Wisconsin DATCP encourages equine owners to talk to their veterinarians about vaccinating their horses for West Nile. The American Association of Equine Practitioners recommends vaccinating for both WNV and Eastern Equine Encephalitis.

More information is available on the DATCP website (https://datcp.wi.gov/pages/SearchResults.aspx?q=west%20nile%20virus) and the website of the Wisconsin Department of Health Services (https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/mosquito/wnv.htm).

Lenawee County public health officials have been notified of a horse in the county being infected with the West Nile virus.

The 13-year-old gray mare became ill on [7 Oct 2021] with neurological signs including ataxia, a reluctance to move, muscle fasciculations (twitching), muzzle tremors and grinding of the teeth, a news release from the county health department said.

While the horse was vaccinated by the owner, it is unclear if the horse was vaccinated against West Nile virus. This is the 1st known case of WNV ever in a domestic animal from Lenawee County and the 5th horse case statewide for 2021. The horse is alive and recovering.

West Nile virus typically circulates between birds and mosquitoes, but an infected mosquito can also transmit the disease through a bite to people and animals, especially horses and other equids.

In Michigan, the disease is typically a concern every summer to early fall.

In addition to animal cases, there have been 40 confirmed human cases of WNV in Michigan so far this year [2021]. These cases are spread over 8 counties, with the majority located in Macomb County, Oakland County and the city of Detroit.

Lenawee County does not have any known human cases of WNV at this time [October 2021]. Lenawee County residents are reminded the best way to protect against WNV and other mosquito-borne illnesses is to protect themselves and their pets and livestock from mosquitoes.

To combat the spread of this disease, animal owners can:
- Talk to their veterinarian about vaccinating their horses against WNV and other mosquito-borne illnesses like eastern equine encephalitis (EEE). There are highly effective, safe vaccines available.
- House their livestock in a barn under fans, as mosquitoes are not strong flyers, during peak mosquito activity from dusk to dawn.
- Use insect repellent on animals approved for the species.
- Eliminate standing water on the property, for example, fill in puddles, repair eaves, and change the water in buckets and bowls at least once a day.
- Contact a veterinarian if an animal shows signs of the illness: mild fever, lack of appetite, lethargy, weakness, stumbling, tremors and a droopy lip or head tilt.
- Cases can be reported by completing and submitting a Reportable Disease Form to <MIReportableAnimal@Michigan.gov>.

Residents can stay healthy outdoors by following steps to avoid mosquito bites:
- Apply insect repellents that contain the active ingredient DEET, or other U.S. Environmental Protection Agency-approved product, to exposed skin or clothing, and always follow the manufacturer's directions for use.
- Wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants when outdoors. Apply insect repellent to clothing to help prevent bites.
- Maintain window and door screening to help keep mosquitoes outside.
- Empty water from mosquito breeding sites around the home, such as buckets, unused kiddie pools, old tires or similar sites where mosquitoes may lay eggs. Use nets or fans over outdoor eating areas.
- Even though it is now October [2021], the mosquitoes carrying WNV and other mosquito-borne diseases such as EEE, will continue to pose a threat until there has been at least 1 hard freeze where the temperatures fall below 28 degrees Fahrenheit [-2 C] for several hours, the release said.

Due to this year's [2021] mild fall temperatures, the mosquitoes are continuing to circulate in the environment and spread the virus.

[3] Tennessee: Weakley County, horse

On [22 Oct 2021] officials at the Tennessee State Veterinarian's office confirmed a 6-year-old Quarter Horse gelding at a Weakley County farm with West Nile virus (WNV). The gelding first showed clinical signs of WNV, which consisted of ataxia (incoordination) and being down, on [14 Oct 2021]. The horse had been vaccinated against WNV. He was euthanized due to the severity of his clinical signs.

WNV transmission occurs when infected mosquitoes feed on animals, as well as humans, after having fed on infected birds.

Clinical signs of WNV in horses include:
- Mild anorexia and depression
- Fine and coarse muscle and skin fasciculation;
- Hyperesthesia (hypersensitivity to touch and sound);
- Changes in mentation (mentality), when horses look like they're daydreaming or "just not with it";
- Occasional drowsiness;
- Propulsive walking (driving or pushing forward, often without control);
- Spinal signs, including asymmetrical weakness; and
- Asymmetrical or symmetrical ataxia.

West Nile virus has no cure; however, some horses can recover with supportive care. Equine mortality rates can reach 30-40%. The American Association of Equine Practitioners includes WNV as one of the core diseases all horses should be vaccinated against at least annually.

[A vaccine is available for horses. The WNV vaccine is often combined with eastern and western equine encephalitis, and tetanus. One vaccine to help prevent potentially deadly consequences for your horses is something every horse owner should be vaccinating with. Please consult your veterinarian regarding getting your horse vaccinated. Also please remember to use mosquito/fly spray approved for use on horses. Some components of sprays not specifically approved for horses can cause serious problems.

Please pay attention when a health department has a news release regarding mosquito trapping or birds with WNV or EEE. These are early warning signs to vaccinate your horses.

Remember to empty any standing water from old tires, potted plants, catch basins, or other locations that can hold even a small amount of water. These are perfect breeding grounds for mosquitoes. - Mod.TG
