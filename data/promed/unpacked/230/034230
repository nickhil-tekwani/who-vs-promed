A suspected dengue patient turned out to be a victim of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) at Holy Family Hospital (HFH) [Rawalpindi, Punjab province].

A man, 53, from Talagang, Chakwal [Punjab province] was brought to HFH on 15 Mar [2016] with symptoms of dengue fever; however, the doctors suspected the patient suffering from Congo [CCHF].

The infectious diseases department doctors sent his blood samples to National Institute of Health (NIH) for Congo serology as the patient was a cattle handler.

HFH Medical Superintendent (MS) Dr Raja Shafique told Dawn that the NIH had confirmed that the patient was suffering from Congo fever, adding that his condition was stable and was discharged on his request.

"The patient wanted to get treatment from the government hospital in his native town," the MS said.

He said another patient from Azad Jammu and Kashmir also arrived in the hospital with symptoms of Congo fever but the NIH report showed that he did not have the disease.

Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever belongs to zoonotic diseases that are transmitted from animals to humans.

[This is the 1st CCHF that ProMED-mail has posted this year (2016) for Pakistan, but there were cases in Punjab province as recently as December last year (2015). Although the circumstances under which the patient acquired his CCHF virus infection are not stated, the cattle with which his is in contact, or perhaps their ticks, are the source. The infections could have been acquired via tick bite or via exposure to the blood of an infected animal.

The virus can cause severe viral hemorrhagic fever outbreaks, with a case fatality rate of 10-40 per cent. The virus is transmitted by _Hyalomma_ spp. ticks or through contact with infected human blood or animal blood and tissues during and immediately after slaughter. The majority of cases have occurred in people involved in the livestock industry, such as agricultural workers, slaughterhouse workers, and veterinarians. Exposure in health care facilities can also occur, which is why there is concern for the health care workers who are in contact with patients.

The length of the incubation period depends on the mode of acquisition of the virus. Following infection by a tick bite, the incubation period is usually 1-3 days, with a maximum of 9 days.

CCHF virus is a tickborne virus in the genus _Nairovirus_, family _Bunyaviridae_.
