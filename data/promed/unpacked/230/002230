2 Dutch poultry flocks infected with a low-pathogenic strain of avian
influenza.
---------------------------------------------------
Health officials in the Netherlands confirmed that birds on 2 poultry
farms -- a chicken farm and a duck operation -- were infected with
avian influenza. They added that the viruses in both cases were
low-pathogenic strains.
Both farms were depopulated in an effort to stop the spread of the
disease, Agriculture Minister Cees Veerman said in a letter to
parliament. Nearly 23 000 birds were slaughtered. 11 Asian countries
have been battling high-pathogenic AI strains. Still, Japan and
Russia immediately banned imports of Dutch poultry.
During 2003, the Netherlands suffered a major AI outbreak, which
forced the slaughter of more than 30 million birds, or 1/3 of the
commercial stock. The latest infections were discovered in routine
inspections introduced after that epidemic. The birds showed no
symptoms of the illness, but had developed antibodies.

[The above-mentioned letter, sent by the Minister of Agriculture, Dr
C.P. Veerman to the Dutch parliament on 17 Mar 2004, is available on
the Ministry's web-site:
<http://www.minlnv.nl/infomart/parlemnt/>.
The following complementary data, translated and summarised from the
letter, adds some pertinent information to this posting:
1. The 1st detected farm, in Eemsmond (Groningen), included (22 000)
free-range chickens. No symptoms were seen; the serological test
indicated an H7 avian influenza virus strain, most likely of low
pathogenicity.
2. The 2nd farm, in Lopik (Utrecht), included 800 free-range ducks.
The serological test indicated an H5 avian influenza virus strain,
most likely of low pathogenicity.
3. In both farms the culling was carried out applying all necessary
hygienic and biosecurity measures.
4. It seems that there is no connection between those cases and the
recent avian influenza outbreaks in Asia, USA, and Canada.
5. The samplings, which have led to the detection of the said 2
infected holdings, are part of the national Dutch surveillance
programme, in which blood samples are annually taken from all poultry
farms, country-wide. Free-range holdings are sampled each quarter,
since they may come in contact with wild birds that are potential
carriers of the low-pathogenic AI virus variants. So far, 1000
poultry holdings have been tested.
6. Neighbouring and in-contact farms of both affected holdings have
been and are being visited and sampled; no additional positive
samples have been found so far.
7. The results of those monitoring activities will be helpful during
a re-evaluation of the precautionary action, to be undertaken later.
8. The farm in Eemsmond has been the first one to be found positive
within the said national surveillance scheme. Future similar
findings, if detected within the ongoing monitoring programme, will
not require immediate reporting to the Parliament but will be
included in regular reports.
