Ongoing mumps outbreak in a student population
with high vaccine coverage, Netherlands, 2010
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary
-------
Since December 2009, mumps incidence has
increased in the Netherlands. As of 20 Apr 2010,
172 cases have been notified on the basis of
laboratory confirmation or linkage to a
laboratory-confirmed case. Of these, 112 were
students, the majority of whom had been
vaccinated (81 percent). Although outbreaks in
vaccinated populations have been described
before, risk factors for exposure and
susceptibility, and dose-dependent vaccine
effectiveness in a student population of this nature are relatively unknown.

Background
----------
Mumps has been a notifiable disease in the
Netherlands since 2009. Notification criteria
include at least one related symptom (acute onset
of painful swelling of the parotid or other
salivary glands, orchitis or meningitis) and
laboratory confirmation of infection or an
epidemiological link to a laboratory-confirmed
case [1]. The measles­mumps­rubella (MMR) vaccine
containing the Jeryl Lynn mumps virus strain was
introduced in the Netherlands in 1987.
Vaccination is recommended, with a 2 dose
schedule at the age of 14 months and 9 years. In
2007 and 2009, an epidemic (genotype D) occurred
in a socio-geographically clustered, Dutch
reformed protestant community with low
vaccination coverage [2]. Nationally however,
vaccine coverage with 2 doses has been
consistently above 93 percent [3]. Despite this,
an outbreak of mumps occurred among vaccinated
national and international students at a
particular school in 2004 [4]. A resurgence of
mumps has been observed in vaccinated populations
in countries worldwide since 2004 [5].

Descriptive epidemiology
------------------------
In the 11 months from January to November 2009,
65 cases of mumps were reported to the National
Institute for Public Health and Environment
(RIVM) in the Netherlands. Between 1 Dec 2009 and
20 Apr 2010, 172 notifications of mumps cases
were received, of whom 24 percent became ill in
late February (week 11) 2010. Seventy-nine of the
cases were from the Municipal Health Service
(MHS) Zuid-Holland West (including the city of
Delft), 44 were from MHS Hollands-Midden
(including the city of Leiden) and accounted for
the majority of cases in week 11, 11 were
reported in MHS Utrecht, and an additional 38
cases were reported from other regions across the
Netherlands. The median age was 21 years (range:
4 to 46 years) and 58 percent (n=99) were male.
Most of the patients had mild symptoms, but 14 (9
percent) reported some complication, which in 12
cases was orchitis (12 percent of men). One
person was hospitalised for one night due to
severe symptoms but had no complications.
Routinely collected notification data revealed
that a large proportion of cases (n=112, 65
percent) were students. A further 11 cases were contacts of students.

A total of 27 student-cases (24 percent of cases)
reported attending a student party (attended by
over 2000 students) held in mid-February (week 8)
over 4 days and nights in a building of the
Leiden student's association. The students
suspected this to be the source of infection.
Given the incubation period of mumps is typically
16 to 18 days, this would coincide with the surge
in cases seen in week 11 in MHS Hollands-Midden.
Some attended the party for one night only
(mainly students from Delft and Utrecht), but the
majority from Leiden attended for 3 or 4 days and
nights in succession. An outbreak investigation
into risk factors for acquisition of mumps by the
MHS in Leiden, Delft and Utrecht is currently
underway in collaboration with the Centre for
Infectious Disease Control of RIVM.

Microbiological findings
------------------------
The clinical diagnosis of notified cases was
laboratory-confirmed by at least one method in 46
percent of cases (n=79): by detection of a
mumps-specific IgM antibody response in 20
percent of cases (n=32), by detection of mumps
virus RNA in 30 percent (n=48), and/or by
cultivation of mumps virus in 10 percent (n=16).
Where there was no laboratory confirmation, an
epidemiological link to a laboratory-confirmed
case was established in 45 percent of cases
(n=78). 5 cases did not meet notification
criteria because they were linked
epidemiologically to an index case, but
laboratory confirmation of that index case was
not established at the time of notification. The
remaining 10 cases reportedly met the
notification criteria, but reasons for
notification were incomplete or missing (n=6
percent). Genotyping of isolated mumps viruses
revealed that the outbreak strain belonged to the G5 lineage.

Vaccination status of cases
---------------------------
Reported vaccination coverage among cases,
particularly among the students, was high. (Data
tabulated in the original text). Of the 164 for
whom vaccine status was known, 115 (70 percent)
were vaccinated and 100 (61 percent) had received
at least 2 mumps vaccinations. Among the 106
students for whom vaccine status was known, 85
(81 percent) were vaccinated at least once, and
79 of them were vaccinated at least twice.

Discussion
----------
Mumps outbreaks among vaccinated populations are
reported world-wide [5-7]. Clinical attack rates
are generally lower in vaccinated populations
(indicating a protective effect), but there is
growing evidence of waning immunity over time,
[8-10] leading to secondary vaccine failure
[4,10-12]. The majority of cases in this outbreak
were students aged 18 to 24 years, of whom 73
percent had received at least 2 mumps
vaccinations. The clustering of cases among
students (in Leiden and to a lesser extent in
Delft and Utrecht) suggests that intensive social
contact during the 4-day party may have
facilitated transmission. Shared living
facilities among members of the students'
association, and the close contact environment of
routine college life are also likely contributing risk factors [13,14].

In accordance with recommendations from the World
Health Organization [15], most countries now
offer a 2-dose vaccine schedule for mumps. In the
Netherlands, all birth cohorts since 1982 have
been offered 2 vaccine doses. Exceptionally,
there is a suggestion that those born in 1986 and
1987 (now aged 23), were offered 3 doses of MMR
at the age of 14 months, 4 years and 9 years
[16], but this remains to be confirmed. Dutch
children are older when they receive the 2nd
vaccine dose (at age 9 years) compared to those
in the United Kingdom, the United States and
Canada, where it is given at 4 to 6 years of age.
Boosting of the immune response by circulating
wildtype virus is unlikely as mumps has not been
widespread in the Netherlands except for a
restricted outbreak within the religious
community a few years previously [2]. Primary
vaccine failure is possible but a
post-vaccination seroprevalence of 93.2 percent
has been shown in children under the age of 3
years in the Netherlands [17]. In addition to the
intensive social contact implicated in this
outbreak, the fact that it occurred among the
oldest vaccinated cohorts in the Netherlands who
received 2 vaccine doses makes secondary vaccine failure more plausible.

Careful investigation will be required to
establish the relationship between increasing age
on the one hand, and incidence rates, severity
and post-exposure disease susceptibility on the
other. Comparison of pre- and post-exposure
antibody titres in a longitudinal study could
give clues about correlates for protection
against mumps virus infection, as this is not
well understood for persons who have received 2
doses of the mumps vaccine. Antigenic differences
between the Jeryl Lynn vaccine strain (genotype
A) and the viral strain in this and other
outbreaks (genotype G) have also previously been
implicated [11], but recent data suggests a good
degree of serologic cross-immunity between Jeryl Lynn and other genotypes [18].

Current outbreak response measures concentrate on
gathering good surveillance data, and students in
the cities affected by this mumps outbreak who
are not fully vaccinated (i.e., with 2 doses of
MMR) are advised to complete their MMR
vaccination. In response to an ongoing outbreak
in the United States among a population of young
adults (age 7-18 years) with a similar high
vaccination coverage, public health officials in
New York have been offering a 3rd dose of MMR
vaccine in some schools since January 2010 [12].
The lower incidence of mumps in the Netherlands
among those born in 1986 who may have received 3
vaccine doses in childhood is certainly
interesting in this respect, but further
investigation is required to confirm this.

On assessment, the risk of a large national
outbreak in the Netherlands is considered to be
low because of high overall vaccine coverage and
the clustered nature of student social life.
Offering a 3rd vaccine dose is not planned at
present. With the cooperation of the municipal
health services and the students' associations,
we intend to conduct further research to better
understand the risk factors associated with mumps
exposure and susceptibility, and dose-related vaccine effectiveness.

[Outbreaks of mumps in vaccinated populations
have been described repeatedly. This analysis
suggests that shared living facilities among
members of a students' association, and the close
contact environment of routine college life are
likely contributing risk factors, rather than
discordance between the mumps component of the
MMR vaccine (genotype A) and the mumps outbreak
strain (genotype G). The fact that the outbreak
occurred among the oldest vaccinated cohorts who
had received 2 vaccine doses suggests that
secondary vaccine failure is a more likely explanation. - Mod.CP]
