Potentially toxic red tide is affecting 3 separate areas on Florida's east
and west coasts for the first known time, marine biologists said Wednesday.
This is the most widespread red tide that we have record of Florida
experiencing,'' Leigh Wallace, a spokeswoman for the Florida Marine Research
Institute, said.
Fish killed by the algae behind the phenomenon have washed up on the west
coast. The outbreak has also forced authorities to close shellfish beds to
prevent the harvesting of contaminated oysters and clams.
Airborne toxins from the outbreak have kept people from beaches while
leaving others with irritated eyes and throats. Red tide irritates the skin
of people exposed to it and can cause itchy eyes, scratchy throats and
coughs.
Researchers say there are now blooms off Florida's west coast near Sarasota,
off the far western panhandle and near Jacksonville on the east coast. The
blooms have reached parts of Texas and North Carolina. It is the first time
since state officials began tracking red tide in 1972 that they have
documented 3 simultaneous blooms.
Red tide is caused by an organism called _Gymnodinium breve_ that in high
concentration can make the water look red. The organism releases a toxin
that paralyzes the respiratory system of fish and other marine life. In 1996
a severe outbreak killed 149 manatees on Florida's southwest coast.
