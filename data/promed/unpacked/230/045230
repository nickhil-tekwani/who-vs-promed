[A 22 Jul 2022 report indicated that the "Danish biotechnology company Bavarian Nordic (BAVA.CO) said on Friday (22 Jul 2022) the European Union's drug regulator had recommended its Imvanex vaccine be approved to also include protection against monkeypox on its label."

"Bavarian's vaccine, the only one to have won approval for the prevention of monkeypox disease in the United States and Canada, has in the EU so far only been approved to treat smallpox. But the company has supplied the vaccine to several EU countries during the current monkeypox outbreak for what is known as "off-label" use.

"The extension of the label will help to improve access to the vaccine throughout Europe and strengthen the future preparedness against monkeypox," Bavarian CEO Paul Chaplin said in a statement."

[A 26 Jul 2022 report indicated that the US has spotted its 1st case of monkeypox this year [2022] in a pregnant woman, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention officials said over the weekend [23-24 Jul 2022]. The baby was delivered safely and both are "doing well. Pregnant women are among those the agency warns may be "at especially increased risk for severe outcomes" from monkeypox. (https://www.cbsnews.com/news/monkeypox-pregnant-woman-baby-cases/).

Another report dated 27 Jul 2022 indicated that the 1st reported case of monkeypox, in the Cook County, Illinois Jail, is a setting where the ability of jail infections to propel community transmission around the jail was well-established by researchers. Monkeypox has arrived behind bars, and the coming weeks will dramatically reframe how we think about this outbreak.
(https://thehill.com/opinion/healthcare/3576465-cdc-must-act-to-prevent-monkeypox-explosion-in-prisons/)

"The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Secretary Xavier Becerra, JD, said that in the coming weeks, 1.1 million doses of the Jynneos monkeypox vaccine will have been made available to Americans.

"They will get into the hands of people who need them over the course of next several weeks," Becerra said. (https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2022/07/hhs-promises-11-million-monkeypox-vaccines-coming-weeks)

"Evidence of the monkeypox virus has shown up in Bay Area wastewater since mid-June [2022], indicating the presence of infection, according to data from Stanford University's Sewer Coronavirus Alert Network (SCAN)."

"The virus has been detected in 10 out of 11 sewersheds that Stanford researchers are studying, including Palo Alto, Sunnyvale, San Jose, Gilroy, Stanford, Silicon Valley Clean Water (in San Mateo County), Davis, Sacramento and two sewersheds in San Francisco, according to the data. Only the University of California, Davis came up negative thus far."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Background
Before April 2022, monkeypox virus infection in humans was seldom reported outside African regions where it is endemic. Currently, cases are occurring worldwide. Transmission, risk factors, clinical presentation, and outcomes of infection are poorly defined.

Methods
We formed an international collaborative group of clinicians who contributed to an international case series to describe the presentation, clinical course, and outcomes of polymerase-chain-reaction-confirmed monkeypox virus infections.

Results
We report 528 infections diagnosed between 27 Apr and 24 Jun 2022, at 43 sites in 16 countries. Overall, 98% of the persons with infection were gay or bisexual men, 75% were White, and 41% had human immunodeficiency virus infection; the median age was 38 years. Transmission was suspected to have occurred through sexual activity in 95% of the persons with infection. In this case series, 95% of the persons presented with a rash (with 64% having <10 lesions), 73% had anogenital lesions, and 41% had mucosal lesions (with 54 having a single genital lesion). Common systemic features preceding the rash included fever (62%), lethargy (41%), myalgia (31%), and headache (27%); lymphadenopathy was also common (reported in 56%). Concomitant sexually transmitted infections were reported in 109 of 377 persons (29%) who were tested. Among the 23 persons with a clear exposure history, the median incubation period was 7 days (range, 3 - 20). Monkeypox virus DNA was detected in 29 of the 32 persons in whom seminal fluid was analyzed. Antiviral treatment was given to 5% of the persons overall, and 70 (13%) were hospitalized; the reasons for hospitalization were pain management, mostly for severe anorectal pain (21 persons); soft-tissue superinfection (18); pharyngitis limiting oral intake (5); eye lesions (2); acute kidney injury (2); myocarditis (2); and infection-control purposes (13). No deaths were reported.

Conclusions
In this case series, monkeypox manifested with a variety of dermatologic and systemic clinical findings. The simultaneous identification of cases outside areas where monkeypox has traditionally been endemic highlights the need for rapid identification and diagnosis of cases to contain further community spread.

Current epidemiological situation as of 21 July 2022
----------------------------------------------------
Cases of monkeypox infection were confirmed in England from 6 May 2022. The outbreak has mainly been in gay, bisexual, and men who have sex with men without documented history of travel to endemic countries. Further details on the epidemiology are available in the monkeypox technical briefing (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/monkeypox-outbreak-technical-briefings).

Up to 21 Jul 2022 there were 2208 laboratory confirmed cases in the UK. Of these, 54 were in Scotland, 15 were in Northern Ireland, 24 were in Wales and 2115 were in England.

Table 1: Number of laboratory confirmed cases by UK nation of residence, 6 May to 21 Jul 2022
UK Nation / Confirmed cases / Changes since 14 Jul 2022
England / 2115 / +65
Northern Ireland / 15 / +2
Scotland / 54 / +3
Wales / 24 / +1
Total / 2208 / +71

A high proportion of England cases were London residents (74%, 1549 of 2103 with location information). For confirmed cases in the UK, where gender information was available, 2079 (99.3%) were male and 15 were female. The median age of confirmed cases in the UK was 37 years (interquartile range 31 to 44).

[5] Costa Rica: 1st report, imported
Date: Tue 26 Jul 2022

http://outbreaknewstoday.com/costa-rica-reports-1st-monkeypox-case-61307


The Costa Rica Ministry of Health reported Wednesday [20 Jul 2022] on the 1st confirmed case of monkeypox. The case is a 34-year-old resident foreigner, who entered the country last week [week of 18 Jul 2022], from a trip abroad, for which he is considered a imported case.

The patient went to a private health center on 17 Jul 2022 due to health problems, which is why he was admitted. On 19 Jul 2022, he presented lesions in the tonsils compatible with monkeypox, which is why the sample was taken. The sample was sent to the Costa Rican Institute for Research and Teaching in Nutrition and Health (INCIENSA), who confirmed the diagnosis by performing a real-time PCR test for this disease.

The person is stable and a health isolation order was issued for 21 days, according to the general guideline for Monkeypox Surveillance, and he will be followed up according to his clinical evolution. Likewise, the Ministry of Health is following up on 5 people who live in the same house.

In the event that the patient does not present major complications, he can be isolated at home, complying with the prevention and control actions in the home environment.

To date, the Ministry of Health has ruled out 6 cases under investigation for monkeypox.

The cases correspond to 2 foreigners, both 21 years old, a 33-year-old foreigner, 2 Costa Ricans, 22 and 56 years old, who underwent a PCR test for _Orthopoxvirus_, giving a negative result, which means that no virus of the monkeypox family was detected. Likewise, a case of a 23-year-old foreigner was recorded who underwent the real-time PCR test for this disease, giving a negative result.
