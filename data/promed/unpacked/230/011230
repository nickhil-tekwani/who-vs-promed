FDA seeks injunction against Pacific Shellfish, Inc.
-----------------------------------------------
The USA FDA is seeking a permanent injunction against Pacific
Shellfish, Inc. An injunction is a court order to stop a firm from
manufacturing, distributing, processing, or shipping a product. The
government's complaint, filed on 24 Jan 2006 by the Department of
Justice in the District Court for the Southern District of
California, charges the defendants with violating the Federal Food,
Drug, and Cosmetic Act by permitting ready-to-eat fish held and
processed in Pacific Shellfish's facility to become contaminated.
According to the complaint, recent FDA inspections in 2004 and 2005
revealed the presence of _Listeria monocytogenes_, a disease-causing
bacterium, on Pacific Shellfish's processing equipment and fish
products. Inspections since 2001 have also documented persistent
unsanitary conditions at the facility. FDA issued a letter to the
firm on 8 Dec 2004, after an inspection revealed unsanitary
conditions and contamination with _Listeria_. Although the firm
promised to correct its deficiencies, a 2005 inspection found that a
persistent strain of _Listeria_ remained and the firm had not
implemented all of the promised corrections.
_Listeria monocytogenesis_ is the causal agent of listeriosis, a
disease that can be very serious, even fatal, for high-risk groups
such as pregnant women, unborn babies, newborns, and those with
impaired immune systems. Although proper cooking can eliminate the
organism in fish products, raw fish products, such as those found in
some types of sushi, pose a serious health risk if contaminated with
_Listeria_. Even if fish is intended to be cooked, however, adequate
sanitation is needed to prevent the spread of this strain throughout
the distribution system and to restaurants and consumer homes, where
it may contaminate ready-to-eat foods. The strain isolated from the
2004 and 2005 inspections was identical to a strain that has caused
human illness.

[The greatest threat of listeriosis is from ready-to-eat products
that do not require further cooking at home. _L. monocytogenes_ in
raw food that will be cooked before consumption is less of a concern
to the food industry, since the bacteria are killed during cooking.
Listeriosis can be acquired from seafood, although most think of the
risk from processed deli meats 1st. Yearly, recalls of seafood,
especially smoked salmon, are posted on FDA's website. Although not
generally linked to large outbreaks, those at high risk, such as
pregnant women and those individuals with compromised cell-mediated
immunity, should avoid the food described below.
_L. monocytogenes_ has been isolated from raw fish, cooked crabs, raw
and cooked shrimp, raw lobster, surimi (minced, processed fish used
in the preparation of imitation seafood, especially imitation
shellfish) and smoked fish (1). Hazards from _L. monocytogenes_ can
be prevented by thoroughly cooking seafood and by preventing
cross-contamination once the seafood is cooked.
The CDC's recommendations regarding the risk of acquiring listeriosis
from seafood (2) include not eating refrigerated smoked seafood
unless it is contained in a cooked dish, such as a casserole.
Refrigerated smoked seafood, such as salmon, trout, whitefish, cod,
tuna or mackerel, is most often labeled as "nova-style," "lox,"
"kippered," "smoked," or "jerky." The fish is found in the
refrigerator section or sold at deli counters of grocery stores and
delicatessens. Canned or shelf-stable smoked seafood may be eaten.
