Physicians have confirmed the diagnosis of West Nile fever [WN] in a
2-year-old child. The mother of the child said that fever appeared in
her child after a mosquito bite. The 1st snow did not kill mosquitoes,
and drove them into the cellars and attics. And from there they came
into doorways to apartments of residents, especially to those who have
a flooded basement.

Experts of Rospotrebnadzor [Federal Service for Supervision of
Consumer Protection and Human Welfare] in the Volgograd region say
that the failure to take preventive measures (drainage, repair of
technical networks, and pest control in flooded basements) creates
favorable conditions for the breeding of mosquitoes -- vectors of West
Nile [virus]. Thus, in the Volgograd region the epidemic season of
West Nile has continued, although generally the [WN virus
transmission] season ends in September.

[From 21 Jul to 14 Nov 2011, 61 cases of West Nile fever were recorded
in the Volgograd region, including 46 cases in Volgograd (75 per cent)
and 15 cases in the districts of the region (25 per cent). Fatal cases
were not registered. - Cor.BA]

[_Culex_ mosquitoes, including those infected with WN or related
flaviviruses, in temperate climatic zones may seek out protected
places to overwinter. Reported cases of WN virus transmission by
overwintering mosquitoes are rare.
