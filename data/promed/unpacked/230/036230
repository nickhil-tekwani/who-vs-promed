As you can see from the above article, as of Wednesday we are officially
into our eleventh anthrax outbreak up here. The carcasses discovered so far
are all in the Lake Claire delta region, which was involved in last year's
outbreak (the toll [referenced in the article for last year's outbreak of
130 bison is a transcription error and should read 103).
The wardens are still running surveillance flights and so far the count
remains at 19. John Nishi meanwhile has been running surveillance over the
Slave River Lowlands and Mackenzie Bison Sanctuary [MBS this week and
reports no bison deaths.

[The Slave River Lowlands -- specifically Hook Lake and Grand Detour -- are
the sites where anthrax was first discovered in the 1960s. MBS had a severe
outbreak in 1993 but no deaths have been found there since. The other known
area for anthrax is Park Central on the northern border of Wood Bison
National Park. This recurrence at the Claire Lake Delta is of interest
because it was impossible last summer to burn any of the carcasses, which
had to be left to scavengers and the weather. This is in contrast to the
MBS, where virtually every carcass was burnt and no more cases have been
seen since; this was probably aided by a subsequent high seroprevalence of
antibodies in the survivors -- a natural vaccination. If it is confirmed
that many of last year's carcass sites still contain spores, it will go a
long way to defining policy of how bison outbreaks should be treated to
prevent further cases. - Mod.MHJ
