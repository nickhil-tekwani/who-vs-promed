_Histoplasma capsulatum_, a dimorphic fungus that causes human disease, is
endemic in North and Central America, particularly in the region of the
Ohio and Mississippi River valleys [of the USA. - Mod.LL]. Humans are
infected by inhalation of the mycelial fragments and microconidia of the
organism. After the emergence of HIV infection, histoplasmosis has become
one of many troublesome opportunistic infections among patients with AIDS.
Patients receiving immunosuppressive agents are also predisposed to _H.
capsulatum_ infection (1). Although the organism is found worldwide, cases
of histoplasmosis are rarely encountered in Taiwan; only a few, imported,
cases have been reported in this decade (2-7). We report the 1st indigenous
case of disseminated histoplasmosis in Taiwan.
In November 2005, a 78 year old man with underlying rheumatoid arthritis
was sent to the emergency department with generalized weakness and poor
appetite of several weeks' duration. He had received oral therapy with
prednisolone (5mg twice daily), hydroxychloroquine (200mg twice daily),
sulfasalazine (1000mg twice daily), and methotrexate (MTX) (15mg weekly)
for 4 months. Physical examination disclosed mild icteric sclera and
multiple ecchymoses on the extremities. A chest radiograph showed bilateral
interstitial micronodules and a fibrocalcified pattern. Abdominal
ultrasonography indicated splenomegaly. The patient was admitted with the
tentative diagnosis of MTX-induced thrombocytopenia.
Bone marrow aspiration (figure 1 [see original URL. - Mod.LL]) and biopsy
were performed because of refractory thrombocytopenia and the presence of
young blood cells on the peripheral blood smears. Intravenous amphotericin
B (0.7 mg/kg/day) was administered because disseminated histoplasmosis was
highly suspected because of the bone marrow findings. Four weeks later, the
fungal culture of the bone marrow showed growth of mold (figure 2A and B
[see original URL. - Mod.LL]). The microorganism was subsequently
identified as _H. capsulatum_ by PCR assay (8). No _H. capsulatum_ was
cultured from the patient's peripheral blood or sputum.
Conclusions:
A variety of laboratory tests for diagnosis of histoplasmosis, including
fungal culture, histopathology, serologic tests, antigen detection, and
molecular methods, have different sensitivities based on clinical
manifestations and host status (9). The standard for diagnosis is isolation
of _H. capsulatum_ from culture. However, it usually requires as much as 4
weeks to grow and has a low sensitivity rate (15 per cent) in self-limited
histoplasmosis. The knobby appearance of macroconidia and microconidia
indicated by Lactophenol Cotton Blue Stain (Hardy Diagnostics, Santa Maria,
CA, USA) of the mold form from fungal cultures is characteristic of _H.
capsulatum_ (10).
In histopathology, histoplasmosis is impressive, with its numerous
ovoid-shaped microorganisms in infected tissue. However, without sufficient
experience, one could misidentify _Blastomyces dermatidis_, _Candida
glabrata_, _Cryptococcus neoformans_, _Penicillium marneffei_, _Leishmania_
spp., _Pneumocystis jirovecii_, or _Toxoplasma gondii_ as _H. capsulatum_
(11). Despite a characteristic form, specific DNA probing is usually
applied for faster definitive identification (12).
In areas where histoplasmosis is not endemic, including Taiwan, serologic
tests, antigen detection reagents, and specific DNA probes for diagnosis of
histoplasmosis are not universally available. Among serologic tests,
immunodiffusion and complement fixation for anti-Histoplasma antibody
detection are widely applied; sensitivity rates are 95-100 per cent and
82-90 per cent for pulmonary and disseminated histoplasmosis, respectively.
Some limitations occur, including the need for 2 to 6 weeks for antibody
production after infection, impaired production of antibodies in
immunosuppressed patients, and presence of cross-reaction mainly due to
paracoccidioidomycosis, blastomycosis, and aspergillosis (9).
Antigen detection in serum and urine is the most useful method of
diagnosing histoplasmosis because it provides early diagnosis before
culture and antibody production, monitors response of therapy, and detects
relapse. The sensitivity rates of antigen detected are 25-75 per cent in
pulmonary histoplasmosis and 82-95 per cent in disseminated histoplasmosis.
Cross-reactions may occur in cases of paracoccidioidomycosis,
blastomycosis, African histoplasmosis, and _P. marneffei_ (9).
Although the environment in Taiwan is suitable for _H. capsulatum_ to grow,
histoplasmosis has been rarely encountered. In a survey of histoplasmin
skin tests conducted in Taiwan in the 1950s, only 7 (0.19 per cent) of 3589
schoolchildren tested positive, and the author concluded histoplasmosis
probably does not exist in Taiwan or is very rare (13). The 1st possible
case of histoplasmosis in Taiwan was reported in 1977; however, the
diagnosis was doubtful because it was based only on histopathologic
findings in a cervical lymph node biopsy specimen, without definitive
fungal culture or molecular identification (2).
No further cases of histoplasmosis were reported in Taiwan until this
decade, when 6 cases were reported (3-7). The clinical characteristics of
these cases are summarized in the appendix table [see original URL. -
Mod.LL]. All cases include a history of travel or residence outside Taiwan,
where the patients might have acquired the infection; furthermore, most of
the patients had underlying HIV infections. Diagnoses were mostly based
only on histopathologic or morphologic findings in fungal cultures because
the serologic tests, antigen detection reagents, and commercial DNA probes
for diagnosis of histoplasmosis were not available in Taiwan. In contrast
to these cases, our patient had never traveled outside Taiwan and did not
have an HIV infection.
To confirm the identification of _H. capsulatum_ on the basis of
histopathologic and fungal form findings, we applied a specific PCR assay
as previously described (8), and the results were definitive. The
fibrocalcific nodules found on the chest radiograph imply that either 1)
the patient might have had histoplasmosis for years and it became
disseminated because of immunosuppressive therapy for rheumatoid arthritis
or 2) the patient was reinfected with the calcified lesions that resulted
from prior histoplasmosis. The results indicate that this is the 1st
definitive indigenous case of disseminated histoplasmosis in Taiwan.
Nonetheless, we were unable to monitor our patient's response to treatment
by antigen tests, as is recommended (9,14), because they are not available
in Taiwan.
The rarity of diagnosed histoplasmosis cases in Taiwan could be explained
in several ways. 1st, the diagnostic rate of histoplasmosis might be
markedly decreased because of the lack of serologic and antigen testing
kits and reagents, which are useful for diagnosis of self-limited and
non-disseminated histoplasmosis. 2nd, pulmonary histoplasmosis might be
misdiagnosed as tuberculosis, which is prevalent in Taiwan. 3rd, physicians
are unfamiliar with histoplasmosis and may consider that histoplasmosis is
absent in Taiwan. With increasing immunocompromised hosts resulting from
immunosuppressive therapy and HIV infections, as well as improved
diagnostic tests, histoplasmosis might be an emergent infectious disease in
Taiwan in the future.
In summary, although an indigenous case of histoplasmosis had never been
encountered, it should be one of the differential diagnoses of
opportunistic infections in immunocompromised patients in Taiwan. The true
prevalence of histoplasmosis in non-disease-endemic regions might be
underestimated because of the paucity of diagnostic tools and familiarity
with histoplasmosis.
