Funding gap threatens response to child measles outbreak in West, Central
Africa
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Countries in West and Central Africa have been hit by a measles outbreak
affecting more than 22 000 children [22 364 cases and 185 deaths in 2010 as
of 28 Mar 2010 - Mod.CP], with a shortage of resources for immunizations
threatening to roll back progress on curbing child mortality in the region,
the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) has warned. A funding shortfall
of USD 16 million for follow-up vaccination campaigns jeopardizes the
health of children in Africa, including the 16 nations [see below] in the
throes of the latest outbreak, according to the agency.

In most West and Central African countries, only 80 per cent or less of
their populations have been immunized, short of the 95 per cent recommended
by the UN World Health Organization (WHO). "Such a figure means they can
expect to have large, sustained outbreaks every 3 to 4 years" said the
agency's regional director for Africa, Luis Gomes Sambo. Nearly 200 child
deaths from measles have been reported in the 16 nations affected by the
outbreak in the past year. "We fail to vaccinate every child. That is why
we have a pool of susceptible victims which builds up as a perfect breeding
ground for measles outbreaks," according to UNICEF's Director for West and
Central Africa, Gianfranco Rotigliano.

Measles [is] among the world's most contagious diseases, easily spread
through coughing or sneezing, and is one of the leading causes of death
among children around the world. Last year [2009], a major outbreak in
Burkina Faso killed 340 people and caused more than 50 000 to get sick,
while more than 16 000 other cases and 68 deaths were reported in Benin,
Guinea, Mali, Niger, and Senegal.

The UN has sought to slash deaths from measles by 90 per cent in the decade
between 2000 and 2010, but the world body's agencies stressed that if
nothing is done to counter the resurgence of the disease, progress made so
far will be reversed. "The funding gap must be met so that countries can
continue to undertake large-scale campaigns to prevent child deaths and
sustain the gains," Mr Sambo of WHO said. "Reaching the 2010 goal will also
require strengthening routine immunization and disease surveillance systems
to rapidly detect and control outbreaks." Immunization and follow-up
vaccination campaigns, funding permitting, are planned this year in Burkina
Faso, Congo, Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo,
Gabon, Ghana, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, and Togo.
