A Oxford University team is considering the possibility of reconstructing
the 1918 influenza virus which killed 20 million people around the world.
The experiment would have to be done in the strictest possible containment,
Professor George Brownlee of the Sir William Dunn School of Pathology in
Oxford, said. Its aim would be to try to discover just what made the 1918
"Spanish flu" so deadly, and to devise better protection against future flu
pandemics.
The virus could be rebuilt, at least in part, because research by
scientists at the US Armed Forces Institute of Pathology in Washington has
worked out the sequence of two of the most important genes in the 1918 flu
virus, using postmortem material from the institute's archives and from a
woman who died of the flu and was buried in the Alaskan permafrost.
A scientist in Professor Brownlee's team, Dr Ervin Fodor, has developed a
method for recreating old viruses from DNA molecules. The method is to be
shown at this week's New Frontiers in Science Exhibition at the Royal
Society in London. "The technique is very simple," Professor Brownlee
said. "It involves adding 12 plasmids of DNA to a cell in tissue culture,
and out pops a virus."
The recipe for the plasmids would be based on what the American scientists,
Jeffry Taubenberger and Ann Reid, have discovered about the 1918 virus.
They have the sequence of two of the most important genes, those for the
protein haemagglutinin and the enzyme neuraminidase, both found on the
surface of the virus. These have cast no obvious light on why the virus
was so lethal and Dr Reid believes that its secret may not lie in a single
gene, but in how well all the viral genes work together.
