The Goaso Government Hospital in the Brong Ahafo region has recorded 94 cholera cases with 3 deaths in 2 months despite reports of the drastic reduction in the rate of infection for the past few months. Speaking to Citi News, the Medical Superintendent of the Hospital, Dr Fosuhene, said: "Definitely what we heard in the news is true. We've had an outbreak here, and it is unprecedented in the Asunafo North."

Cholera has claimed over 100 lives, with more than 10 000 cases recorded across the country since its outbreak in 2014.

The Asunafo North Municipal Environmental Health Officer attributed the situation to open defecation in the municipality. He, therefore, advised residents in the area to keep their environment clean to prevent a further spread of the disease.

[The etiology of the dysentery in this Armenian outbreak is not stated, nor is it entirely clear that the episode was foodborne. Bacillary dysentery caused by _Shigella_ is readily spread from child to child without it being food-associated. - Mod.LL
