SUMMARY - Week 20/2015 (11-17 May 2015)
---------------
- The 2014-2015 influenza season has ended.
- All countries reported low intensity of influenza activity with only a few sporadic influenza virus detections across the Region, indicating a return to baseline levels.
- The duration of the season 2014-15 was 21 weeks (week 51/2014-19/2015) with a peak of activity in week 07/2015.
- During the season, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2) and type B viruses circulated in the Region. Influenza type A viruses accounted for 67 percent of sentinel detections overall, but for the last 9 weeks B viruses dominated.
- Excess all-cause mortality among people aged 65 years and above, concomitant with increased influenza activity and the predominance of A(H3N2) viruses, had been observed in most countries participating in the European project for monitoring excess mortality for public health action (EuroMOMO), but this has abated (see the EuroMOMO website).
- Antigenic drift in a proportion of A(H3N2) viruses was observed in the 2014-2015 influenza season, so the northern-hemisphere vaccine did not provide broad protection against A(H3N2) viruses. Despite some antigenic drift among B/Yamagata viruses, the A(H1N1)pdm09 and B/Yamagata components in the vaccine were likely to protect against circulating viruses.
- Of all the influenza viruses screened for reduced susceptibility to neuraminidase inhibitors, only 4 A(H3N2) and 2 A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses have shown genetic or phenotypic evidence of reduced susceptibility.

Virus characteristics
-----
Since week 40/2014, 1631 influenza viruses have been attributed to a genetic group, and 2158 have been attributed to an antigenic category (Tables 2 and 3). In addition, 43 A(H3N2), 26 A(H1N1) and 3 B/Yamagata-lineage viruses were attributed to a genetic group not listed in the database, and 62 A(H3N2), 8 A(H1N1)pdm09, 52 B/Yamagata- and 3 B/Victoria-lineage viruses were reported that were not attributable to an antigenic category.

A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses
-------
All 272 A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses characterized genetically fell in clade 6, with 266 (98 percent) falling in subgroup 6B. Viruses falling in these genetic groups, along with the 465 A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses attributed to an antigenic category to date, are similar to the component included in the 2014-2015 northern hemisphere vaccines.

A(H3N2) viruses
------
Of the 983 A(H3N2) viruses attributed to a genetic group, most fell into genetic subgroups that have been shown to be antigenically dissimilar to the current A(H3N2) vaccine virus: 62 percent in genetic subgroup 3C.2a, represented by A/Hong Kong/5738/2014; and less than 7 percent in genetic subgroup 3C.3a, represented by A/Switzerland/9715293/2013. Viruses which have been shown to be antigenically similar to the current A(H3N2) vaccine virus represented 31 percent and fell into genetic group 3C.3, represented by A/Samara/73/2013. A proportion of the latter viruses can be designated as subgroup 3C.3b, but these remain antigenically similar to the current A(H3N2) vaccine virus.

Of 887 A(H3N2) viruses attributed to an antigenic category, 71 percent were A/Switzerland/9715293/2013-like and thus dissimilar to the A/Texas/50/2012 vaccine virus. Together, these observations indicate that the current A(H3N2) component of influenza vaccines will probably have limited effectiveness, as reported for North America.

Influenza B viruses
-----
Of the 367 B/Yamagata-lineage viruses characterized genetically to date, all fell in clade 3, with 99 percent being represented by B/Phuket/3073/2013. The 9 B/Victoria-lineage viruses all belonged to the B/Brisbane/60/2008 clade (clade 1A).

Similar proportions were observed among the 806 influenza B viruses characterized antigenically, with 98 percent being attributed to antigenic groups of the Yamagata lineage; the Victoria-lineage viruses were B/Brisbane/60/2008-like, the virus recommended for inclusion in quadrivalent vaccines. Of the 793 Yamagata-lineage viruses, 158 (21 percent) were similar to B/Massachusetts/2/2012, a virus from genetic clade 2 included in the current 2014-2015 northern hemisphere trivalent and quadrivalent vaccines, while 628 (79 percent) were B/Phuket/3073/2013-like, the virus from genetic clade 3 recommended for the southern hemisphere 2015 and northern hemisphere 2015-2016 influenza season vaccines. In addition, 1 B/Wisconsin/1/2010-like and 6 B/Florida/4/2006-like Yamagata-lineage viruses have been reported; such viruses show antigenic similarity to B/Phuket/3073/2013.

Antiviral resistance testing
-------
Of the 1535 A(H3N2) influenza viruses that underwent phenotypic or genotypic testing for neuraminidase inhibitor susceptibility, 4 (0.3 percent) showed evidence of reduced susceptibility to oseltamivir, 3 due to NA E119V amino acid substitution and 1 due to NA R292K substitution. The latter virus also showed reduced susceptibility to zanamivir (Table 4). Of the 566 A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses analysed, 2 (0.4 percent) showed evidence of highly reduced inhibition by oseltamivir. 1, characterized genetically, had NA H275Y amino acid substitution while the other, characterized phenotypically, showed more than a 100-fold increase in IC50 for oseltamivir compared to susceptible A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses. None of the influenza B viruses analysed showed reduced susceptibility to either oseltamivir or zanamivir.
