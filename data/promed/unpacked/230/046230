A man died yesterday [16 Apr 2016] of Lassa fever at the University of Benin Teaching Hospital (UBTH). All the doctors, nurses and other auxiliary staff who had contact with the late patient are currently being quarantined.

Impeccable sources at the hospital disclosed that the patient, whose identity could not be verified at press time, died last week in the intensive care unit [ICU] of the hospital, after a surgical operation. The sources, who requested anonymity as they were not authorised to speak on the issue, further disclosed that all the doctors, nurses and other auxiliary staff in the theatre and the ICU who had contact with the late patient are currently being quarantined and closely monitored for symptoms of the hemorrhagic disease.

It was also gathered that all equipment that was used to treat the patient, both in the theatre and the ICU, is also being quarantined and sterilized.

All efforts made to get confirmation from the hospital management failed, as calls made to the hospital's public relations officer, Kehinde Ibitoye, went unanswered. For her part, the state commissioner for health, Dr Aihianuwa Eregie, said she was not aware of the incident. "No, I don't have this information, but I will confirm to know if the death was caused by Lassa fever," she said.

Many have died from Lassa fever. The number of Lassa fever infections across West Africa every year is between 100 000 to 300 000, with about 5000 deaths, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In Taraba state, 14 people have been killed by the disease, while 21 people out of the 49 suspected cases have been treated and discharged from January [2016] to date.

[Cases continue to occur across Nigeria, and there is one more fatal case in Taraba state. There is close surveillance of the medical staff there, a prudent measure since transmission to hospital staff in the endemic area is not unusual.

The reported cases of Lassa fever in Nigeria have been increasing recently. The reason for the higher than usual number of fatal cases is undetermined. One possibility is an increase in the populations of the Lassa fever virus reservoir host, the multimammate mouse (_Mastomys_ spp), with an increase in numbers of virus carriers due to more favorable environmental conditions for them. This could result in more contamination of the environment with virus-containing excreta from these rodents.

Prevention and control of Lassa fever in nature depends on control of the rodent reservoir, which occurs across Nigeria and beyond. Reduction of populations of this rodent will require active participation at the village level. That will necessitate mounting a public education program with support of rodent control technicians. Preventing entry of rodents into the home and keeping food materials tightly covered are helpful measures to prevent infection.

Lassa virus is a member of the family _Arenaviridae_ and can cause acute hemorrhagic fever in humans.
