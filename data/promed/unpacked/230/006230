[1] Cholera - Nigeria [Kano State]

No fewer than 15 persons have died, and scores have been hospitalized as a result of a suspected cholera outbreak in Koya village in Minjibiri Local Government Area of Kano State.

Though the Ministry of Health is yet to comment on the development, village head of the community, Sulieman Mohammad confirmed the deaths to journalists, saying victims included children and women. He said a victim died about 15 minutes after he broke his Muslim fast Friday night, 7 May 2021.

It was learned that health officials from the state government are already in the affected village and have been counselling residents against drinking water from wells and streams in the community.

Chairman of Minjibiri LGA, Saleh Ado Minijibiri, at a press conference, said the cholera outbreak could have been caused by indiscriminate digging and poor management of feces and urine sucker pits by residents. He said that while special arrangements have been made for those already hospitalized in a bid to contain the spread of the disease, a stakeholders' meeting geared at permanently addressing the issue would be held in the council soon.

[2] Cholera - Nigeria [Benue State]

"I was not only scared about my health, I was also scared for the wellbeing of 3 of my children admitted at the same time as I was at the hospital," said a mother of 4 from Benue State. She and her family were some of the people diagnosed with cholera from Abinsi community and treated at the Primary Health Care Centre Abinsi, in Guma Local Government Area (LGA).

"I was diagnosed with cholera alongside 3 of my children. I was so worried about our health. I was not able to take care of them because we were all on admission [at the] same time. Unfortunately, I lost one of my children to the disease. Although I am still sad about losing my child, I am grateful to Allah for the help we got from the state government and World Health Organization (WHO). If not for their timely intervention, we would all have died," she said.

Cholera is a waterborne disease that lives in the environment and infects humans. Early in January 2021, the LGA Disease Surveillance Notification Officers (DSNOs) of Agatu and Guma reported suspected cases of the disease with onset of index cases in Agatu and Guma being 30 Dec 2020 and 5 Jan 2021, respectively. A common feature of both settlements is their location on the bank of River Benue, from which they also derive their source of water.

Two other LGAs, Markurdi and Gwer West, are also located along the River Benue with Oju, which also reported several cases and deaths, being the only LGA far from the River Benue. Benue State is not the only state reporting an outbreak of cholera since the beginning of the year [2021]. Seven other states, including Delta, Zamfara, Gombe, Bayelsa, Kogi, Sokoto, and Nasarawa, have similarly registered confirmed cholera outbreaks in 2021. In addition, there have been 7 other states with suspected cholera outbreaks.

Cumulatively, 3413 suspected cases including 111 deaths have been reported by 15 states. A total of 1746 suspected cases including 50 deaths were reported by the 8 states with confirmed outbreaks. Benue State reported 718 cases. The majority of the confirmed cases, 63%, are children aged 5-14 years according to data from the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC).

The number of new cases is progressively declining across all states since mid-April 2021. This is a result of more concerted response interventions by respective states with support from the NCDC, WHO and other partners.

In Benue, WHO collaborated with the State Primary Health Care Board, the National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA) and NCDC to sponsor and conduct an oral cholera vaccination campaign targeting the most affected group, i.e., children aged 2-5 years, in the affected settlements with the limited quantity of vaccines that were available. A total of 40 493 children aged 2-5 years were vaccinated.

WHO also supported Benue State with medical supplies to treatment centres used for the treatment of cases in the affected communities. The state was also supported in conducting community sensitization campaigns on cholera.

Dr. Ahemen Terseer, WHO State Coordinator at Benue State, said the quick intervention yielded a positive result in the state leading to a decline in cases now being reported. "Within one week of having the borehole in the community, no new cases were reported!"

Other control measures embarked upon are community sensitization on water and food hygiene. There have been campaigns on the need to stop the practice of open defecation. Jingles are also on the radio stations in the state, he said.

[As stated by Lutwick et al. (Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In: Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Edited by Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J. New York: Nova Bioscience; 2017, pp 113-127), oral rehydration therapy can be lifesaving in outbreaks of cholera and other forms of diarrhea:

"As reviewed by Guerrant et al. (1), it was in 1831 that cholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement, and, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not until 1960 was it 1st recognized that there was no true destruction of the intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could be effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the intravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could be just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (for example, refs 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy (ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact on the morbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant et al (1) highlight the use of oral glucose-salt packets in war-torn Bangladeshi refugees, which reduced the mortality rate from 30% to 3.6% (4) and quote sources referring to ORT as "potentially the most important medical advance" of the 20th century. A variety of formulations of ORT exist, generally glucose- or rice powder-based, which contain a variety of micronutrients, especially zinc (5).

"The assessment of the degree of volume loss in those with diarrhea to approximate volume and fluid losses can be found in ref 6. below. Those with severe hypovolemia should be initially rehydrated intravenously with a fluid bolus of normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution of 20-30 mL/kg followed by 100 mL/kg in the 1st 4 hours and 100 mL/kg over the next 18 hours with regular reassessment. Those with lesser degrees of hypovolemia can be rehydrated orally with a glucose or rice-derived formula with up to 4 liters in the 1st 4 hours, and those with no hypovolemia can be given ORT after each liquid stool with frequent reevaluation."
