The Federal Ministry of Health has confirmed 3 outbreaks of bluetongue (BT) in the provinces of Burgenland and Styria.

Bluetongue is an animal disease not dangerous to humans. The transmission of the pathogen -- Bluetongue virus -- occurs exclusively via biting midges.

Samples from 3 cattle farms in eastern Austria, taken as part of the national BT surveillance program, were tested at the Austrian Agency for Health and Food Safety (AGES) and found positive for the Bluetongue virus. Thus, the presence of bluetongue in Austria is confirmed. The animals on the affected farms showed no symptoms of disease.

Due to the confirmation of the disease, the necessary measures, which are regulated in the EU area, are currently being put in place by the veterinary authorities. In addition to the designation of a restricted area to monitor and control the further spread of the disease, movement restrictions between zones are being implemented. Animals within a zone may be moved without restrictions. Exit into free areas is only possible if the animals are considered protected. The status "protected" can be achieved by vaccination, observing the legal time frame. There is a vaccine against bluetongue. This may be applied preventively by a vet at the request of the farmer.

The Federal Ministry of Health has also already informed the industry of the measures taken. Killing of infected animals or mandatory vaccination of susceptible animals (ruminants, camelids) are not considered necessary at the moment.

Bluetongue occurred most recently in Austria in 2008. During that time, other European countries were infected with Bluetongue virus serotype 8. Since early September 2015, the Hungarian veterinary authorities reported the occurrence of serotype 4. In Hungary at the moment, 68 cattle on 29 farms and 2 sheep on 2 holdings have been confirmed infected.

[The serotyping results of the virus involved are awaited. As indicated in the press release, 2 BTV serotypes are currently circulating in Europe, BTV-8 (France) and BTV-4 (Greece, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, Croatia). For a map, updated on 22 Oct 2015, of the European BTV situation according to serotypes, please see slide No. 10 in the presentation of the mission of the "EU Community Veterinary Emergency Team in Hungary" in relation to the bluetongue situation, 28-29 Oct 2015, presented to the PAFF Committee, Brussels on 9 Nov 2015, available at
http://ec.europa.eu/food/animals/docs/reg-com_ahw_20151109_pres_bluetongue_hungary_cvet_en.pdf.

In addition to the said report, national presentations to PAFF of the delegates of France, Spain, Romania, and Hungary on their respective BT situations are available as well at http://ec.europa.eu/food/animals/health/regulatory_committee/presentations_en.htm#20151109.

Culicoides activity, and consequently BTV circulation, are expected to decline as temperatures fall. - Mod.AS
