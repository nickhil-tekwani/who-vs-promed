WHO Influenza Update number 150
------------------------------
Summary
------------
- Influenza activity in the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere remains below seasonal threshold levels, though notable increases in activity have been reported in some areas of Canada, Europe (Spain and Turkey), northern Africa (Tunisia and Algeria), and the Middle East (Iran). The persistence of the increased activity over the last few weeks in these areas likely represents the start of the influenza transmission season.

- The viruses detected throughout the northern hemisphere temperate zone have been predominantly of the A(H3N2) subtype. Only very small numbers of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 have been reported in recent weeks.

- Countries in the tropical zone reported low levels of influenza activity except for Costa Rica, which is primarily detecting influenza A(H3N2).

- Influenza activity in the temperate countries of the southern hemisphere is at inter-seasonal levels, though Chile and Australia both report persistent transmission of A(H3N2) with smaller numbers of influenza type B in Australia.

Countries in the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere
-------------------------------------
Influenza activity in the northern hemisphere temperate regions is still below baseline, though increased respiratory disease activity and influenza virus detections have been noted in some areas.

North America

In Canada, the percent of positive influenza tests and consultation rates for influenza-like illness (ILI) have persistently increased since mid-December 2011. However, nationally, influenza activity remained at inter-seasonal levels. Localized influenza activity was reported in the region of British Columbia, and sporadic cases were reported in 9 regions of 4 provinces (Alberta, British Columbia, Ontario and Quebec). Three influenza outbreaks in long term care facilities and 2 paediatric influenza hospitalisations were reported in the last week. Of the 63 laboratory confirmed cases reported, 51 were influenza A(H3N2), 7 were unsubtyped influenza A, and 2 were influenza type B. To date, this season [2011-2012], there have been 10 adult influenza hospitalisations, of which 6 were over 65 years of age.

In the United States of America, nationally, ILI consultations were low (1.2 percent) and remained below the baseline level (2.4 percent), and the percentage of samples positive for influenza remained below 2 percent; both have increased since mid-December 2011. Of the nearly 1000 virus detections reported since October 2011, 85 percent have been influenza type A. Of the influenza A viruses that have been subtyped, 84 percent were A(H3N2) and the remainder A(H1N1)pdm09. The proportion of deaths due to pneumonia and influenza reported in the 122 cities sentinel surveillance system was low compared to previous years.

Europe
- Western Europe circulation of influenza viruses (late March - end December 2011 snapshot) http://www.who.int/influenza/surveillance_monitoring/updates/2012_01_06_influenza_western_europe_circulation_main.jpg

In Europe, influenza activity remains low, though respiratory disease activity and influenza virus detections have started to increase in some areas over a period of several weeks. ILI consultations and admissions for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) remain at inter-seasonal levels overall. Of the 35 countries reporting on the geographical distribution of influenza activity, 21 reported no activity, one reported local activity (Italy), and 13 reported sporadic activity in recent weeks. Spain and Turkey reported notable increases in influenza virus detections among sentinel samples with percentages of positive samples of 17 percent and 23 percent, respectively. Influenza A(H3N2) was the most common virus detected. In France, the consultation rate for acute respiratory infections exceeded the seasonal baseline level; however, there was no corresponding increase in ILI consultations or influenza virus detections. 23 percent of European sentinel samples tested for influenza in epidemiological week 51 were positive, a doubling from the previous week. Influenza A(H3N2) was the most common virus identified; 94 percent of 414 influenza A viruses characterized were the A(H3N2) subtype.

Northern Africa and Eastern Mediterranean
The northern Africa and eastern Mediterranean regions have been reporting increasing numbers of positive influenza specimens since October 2011, particularly in Algeria, Tunisia and Iran. As in Europe, influenza A(H3N2) was the predominant subtype detected.

Temperate countries of Asia
In northern China, influenza activity increased slightly, to 8.6 percent, since the previous week; influenza B virus is still the predominant strain in China. Republic of Korea and Japan have both reported small but slightly increased numbers of influenza positive specimens in recent weeks, most of which were A(H3N2).

Countries in the tropical zone
-------------------------
Tropical countries of the Americas
No notable influenza transmission has been reported in the majority of Caribbean and central American countries, with the exception of Costa Rica, which has continued to report increasing numbers of influenza A(H3N2) detections.

Sub-Saharan Africa
In sub-Saharan Africa, only sporadic detections or low level transmission were reported. Transmission of influenza A(H3N2) in Cameroon appears to be decreasing after peaking in mid-December 2011. Kenya has reported continuous influenza transmission; however, the number of positive specimens has been decreasing in the past 4 weeks and is now at a very low level.

Tropical Asia
Overall, the influenza activity in tropical Asia remained low. Since September 2011, India has continued to report low level influenza B circulation. Following peaks in influenza activity in September 2011, Lao People's Democratic Republic, Cambodia and Viet Nam have reported decreasing transmission, which has now returned to low levels. Other countries in tropical Asia continue to report small numbers of both A(H3N2) and influenza type B.

Countries in the temperate zone of the southern hemisphere

- Australia circulation of influenza viruses (snapshot) pdf, 395kb http://www.who.int/influenza/surveillance_monitoring/updates/2012_01_06_influenza_australia_circulation_main.pdf

In temperate countries of the southern hemisphere, influenza activity is at inter-seasonal levels; however, Chile and Australia both report low levels of persistent influenza A(H3N2), with much smaller numbers of influenza type B also reported in Australia.

Source of data
------------
The Global Influenza Programme monitors influenza activity worldwide and publishes an update every 2 weeks. The updates are based on available epidemiological and virological data sources, including FluNet (reported by the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System) and influenza reports from WHO Regional Offices and Member States. Completeness can vary among updates due to availability and quality of data available at the time when the update is developed.

[Interested readers are recommended to access the diagrams referenced to above to gain a rapid appreciation of the current influenza situation.

Influenza transmission remains low or at inter-seasonal levels throughout the world, but there have been indications since the last update of increased activity in some areas, suggesting imminent onset of the influenza transmission season. Influenza A/H3N2 and influenza B viruses predominate, with the A/(H1N1)pdm09 virus infrequently detected.

An additional human case of infection with a variant influenza A(H3N2) virus A(H3N2)v was confirmed in the United States of America. The A(H3N2)v virus has 7 genes from the triple reassortant A(H3N2) viruses known to have been circulating in pigs in North America and the M gene from an A(H1N1)pdm09 virus. There are now 12 human cases of A(H3N2)v infection. All these viruses characterized so far are antigenically closely related to the candidate vaccine virus developed from A/Minnesota/11/2010.

According to the FluNet summary for weeks 49 to 51 of 2011 (4 to 24 Dec 2011), WHO laboratories tested more than 41 995 specimens. 2433 were positive for influenza viruses, of which 1715 (70 percent) were typed as influenza A and 718 (30 percent) as influenza B. Of the sub-typed influenza A viruses, 101 (7 percent) were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and 1315 (93 percent) were influenza A(H3N2). Of the characterised B viruses, 66 (47 percent) belong to the B-Yamagata lineage and 74 (53 percent) to the B-Victoria lineage (http://www.who.int/influenza/gisrs_laboratory/updates/summaryreport/en/index.html). - Mod.CP]
