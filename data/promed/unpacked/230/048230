A ratoon stunting disease epidemic in the Papua New Guinea [PNG] sugar industry
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The only commercial sugarcane operation in PNG is located in the Ramu
Valley, Madang Province. Ratoon stunting disease (RSD) was found to
be absent from the area during surveys in 2000, but was detected for
the 1st time in PNG in samples collected during 2002. The very
infectious nature of the pathogen, the absence of facilities for hot
water treatment, and the failure to regularly apply phytosanitary
measures are considered to be the reasons for the extensive spread of
the disease since then.
This report states that the epidemic is probably at its peak now. The
disease is estimated to cause yield losses of 10-20 percent at
present. Monitoring and control programmes have been designed, but
their success will depend on the strict application of disease
management strategies. Resistance breeding programmes may be needed
in the long term.

[RSD is caused by the bacterium _Leifsonia xyli_ s.sp. _xyli_
(previously _Clavibacter xyli_ s.sp. _xyli_). The disease occurs in
all cane-growing areas of the world but until recently, was not
reported from PNG. There are no clear external symptoms, only
irregular stunting and general loss of vigour similar to the effects
of external stresses. Internal symptoms of nodal discolouration do
not develop adequately in all cane varieties. Reliable diagnosis can
be performed only by microscopy or molecular techniques. RSD is
considered one of the most important diseases affecting sugarcane
production worldwide. It can cause a 5-15 percent yield loss without
an infection being noticed in the crop, and therefore the disease is
often under-estimated.
When a comprehensive survey was undertaken by the same authors
following the 1st record of the pathogen in PNG, 84 percent of 700
cane samples from commercial sugarcane plantings, and 20 percent of
120 samples from the wild or village gardens were shown to be
infected with RSD. Several consecutive hot water treatments can be
used to eliminate the pathogen from cuttings to set up disease-free
nurseries for planting material. Disease management must also include
strict phytosanitary measures to minimise re-infection in the nursery
and in the field. However, in PNG bush knives carried by indigenous
people are often used for random cutting of sugarcane and this may
lead to continued transmission of RSD. Some tolerant cane varieties
are available, but they still support growth of the bacteria and
therefore do not eliminate the disease from the area.
