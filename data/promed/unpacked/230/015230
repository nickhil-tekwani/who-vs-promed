["Leishmaniosis is not a single entity but comprises a variety of syndromes caused primarily by at least 16 _Leishmania_ species affecting humans, transmitted by phlebotomine sandflies belonging to the genera _Phlebotomus_ and _Lutzomyia_. Leishmaniosis is associated with and limited by the geographic distribution of its sandfly vectors. 15 nosogeographical entities have been classified worldwide, of which 13 have an established or putative zoonotic nature. In recent years, the number of regions becoming _Leishmania_-endemic has grown significantly, accompanied by an increased number of animal and human cases.

"In humans, the clinical spectrum ranges from asymptomatic infections to those with high mortality, with 3 distinct forms being classically described: visceral (VL), cutaneous (CL), and mucocutaneous (MCL). Dogs are commonly affected by _L. infantum_ and _L. chagasi_ (now regarded as synonyms), which causes a chronic viscero-cutaneous disease in this host (canine leishmaniosis, CanL). Asymptomatic infection in dogs is widespread and contributes to maintaining the long-term presence of the parasite in endemic regions. The clinical appearance and evolution of leishmaniosis is a consequence of complex interactions between the parasite and host immune response. The outcome of infection depends on the ability of host macrophages to effectively destroy the parasite."
