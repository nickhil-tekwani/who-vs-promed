An unusual spike in influenza, including cases that required hospital care, is being monitored closely by the Health Department. 8 people have been admitted to King Edward VII Memorial [Hospital] with flu-like symptoms since 21 May 2012 -- 7 of them children.

A spokeswoman for the Bermuda Hospitals Board said the increase seen at the Emergency Room most likely meant a larger number of cases being reported to private doctors. She added: "There have been approximately 26 patients with flu-like symptoms (viral illness, influenza, flu) seen by the emergency department between Wed 6 and Wed 13 Jun 2012." And a Health spokeswoman said the increase in flu and respiratory illness was "above the level ordinarily seen" for this time of year. Such illnesses can remain a threat long after their usual peak season in January and February.

The currently available flu shot is considered effective against the present strain[s] of flu. Supplies of the vaccine are available until the end of this month [June 2012], and are advised for young children, senior citizens, pregnant women, or people with chronic illness. Flu symptoms include a high fever, coughing, and muscle aches. Those with signs of illness, or who have been in contact with people with symptoms, are encouraged to seek doctors' advice, since early medical attention is important when symptoms are severe. Covering up sneezes, washing hands, and avoiding public areas are also recommended when experiencing respiratory symptoms. Cases are being monitored by the Epidemiology and Surveillance Unit of the Health Department. For more information go to http://www.health.gov.bm or http://www.cdc.gov/flu/.

[Unfortunately this report provides no identification of the influenza virus (or viruses) responsible for these late season cases in Bermuda. Further information would be appreciated. According to the most recent WHO global update influenza B was the predominant virus circulating in both Canada and the USA with co-circulation of mainly influenza A(H3N2) virus. In the Caribbean and Central America influenza virus activity has been reported from the Dominican Republic and El Salvador where A(H3N2) and influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus were the main circulating virus subtypes respectively.
