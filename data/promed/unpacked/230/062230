Hong Kong: 20 Imported Cases Reported in First 6 Months of 2003
--------------------------------------------------
The number of dengue fever patients in Hong Kong hospitals in 2003 is more
than 3 times what it was for the same period of 2002, but health
authorities said yesterday that, so far, all were imported cases. According
to the Department of Health, 20 imported cases were recorded in the first 6
months, compared with only 6 imported cases in the same period of 2002.
"But this should also be a warning," medical and health officer Tsang
Sam-fung said. "In the past, when we had imported cases, we also got some
local ones." There were 44 cases last year, 20 of which were local.
Dengue fever is an acute viral disease with an incubation period of 3 to 14
days. Symptoms include high fever for 3 to 5 days, severe headache, muscle
and joint pain, eye pain, nausea, vomiting and skin rash. In severe cases,
patients may suffer from bleeding and shock, and some can die. Children
normally have milder symptoms than adults.
There are 4 strains of the virus, with most Hong Kong patients contracting
dengue virus type 1. Though those who recover developed antibodies, the
department said they must not be complacent, as they could contract the
other strains and which could lead to even more complications. "If a person
gets infected with 2 strains of dengue fever, he or she could suffer from
internal bleeding or blackout. The death rate for general dengue fever is
lower than one percent, but if there are complications, it could go as high
as 30 percent," Tsang said.
Dengue virus is transmitted to humans through mosquito bites. The mosquito
_Aedes albopictus_ can be found in Hong Kong. The mosquito usually attacks
its victims in daylight, especially 2 hours after sunrise and a few hours
before sunset, the department said.
At present, there is no effective vaccine against dengue fever, but the
disease does not spread from person to person. The department urged the
public to clear stagnant water from their premises, and to wear long
sleeves and trousers and use insect repellent when outdoors.

India: Dengue Fever Outbreak Continues Unabated in Kerala
---------------------------------------------------
As of Sun 13 Jul 2003, the sweep of dengue fever continues unabated due a
combination of ineffective vector control measures and misplaced reliance
on so-called preventive drugs, according to the findings of a recent survey
undertaken by the Indian Medical Association (IMA) in the city. The survey,
which covered 1040 high school students of a Government school and a
`street sample' of 528 people, found that 46.9 per cent of children and
40.9 per cent of adults were affected by fever during the past 2 months.
The results of the study were announced by the IMA office-holders today.
As many as 44.7 percent of the surveyed population had been infected by
fever in the past 2 months. The prevalence of fever in children (17.3 per
cent) and adults (16.47 per cent) during the last week was higher than the
average of 5.58 percent over the past 2 months, and this indicated that the
epidemic was far from being under control.
The IMA expressed doubts over the efficacy of the medicines being promoted
as a preventive against dengue infection. According to the association,
children and adults who were administered these medicines developed fever,
while those who did not take them, had not. What was more serious was that
21.87 percent of adults and 9.31 percent of children who were administered
these so-called preventive drugs also developed side-effects ranging from
body ache and giddiness to diarrhoea and vomiting.
According to the IMA, while standard medical literature recommended
controlling the _Aedes_ mosquito species, the survey established that the
community at large was exposed to the dengue threat, as vector control and
environmental hygiene improvement measures covered barely 21 percent of the
area. The IMA called for urgent vector control measures to prevent
re-infection as well as to preempt fresh infections. Periodic vector
surveys to limit the vector density, regular inter-epidemic surveillance,
and inter-departmental coordination were also recommended.

Germany: Nosocomial Dengue Virus Infection 2002
------------------------------------------
[Dr. Christina Frank has provided the following information in response to
ProMED-mail's request for further information regarding the circumstances
surrounding a case of nosocomial transmission of dengue fever in Germany -
see part [3] of Dengue/DHF update 2003 (28) 20030714.1736. - Mod.CP]
The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) is the center for national level
surveillance and control of infectious diseases in Germany. In the second
half of 2002, RKI was notified of a case of dengue fever acquired in
Germany. From the case report and by request for more detailed information
from the reporting health department it was understood that transmission
had occurred through a needle stick injury in the occupational setting.
Additional information was provided by a poster presentation at a German
infectious disease conference in February/March of 2003 (in German,
abstract published in Infection 2003;31 (Suppl 1):117): TM Bauer, et al.,
from the University Hospital of Freiburg), described the case patient as a
nurse who in July of 2002 had jabbed her finger with a hollow needle in the
process of discarding it, producing a bleeding wound. The needle had
previously been used to draw blood from a newly admitted patient. This
index patient suffered from fever and myalgia shortly after returning from
Cambodia and turned out to be IgG-positive for dengue virus.
On day 4 after the injury, the nurse developed headaches, myalgia, and
arthralgia; by day 10 she suffered from strong headaches, exanthema and
enlarged lymph nodes. Symptoms persisted for 4 weeks. The lack of fever
possibly was due to medication with NSAIDs. IgM for dengue virus was
positive by day 27, IgG was still negative at day 41 (Dengue Indirect IgG
ELISA test, Dengue IgM Capture ELISA test, Pan-Bio).
Other very similar cases of nosocomial transmission of dengue virus have
been published: B de Wazieres, et al., described nosocomial dengue
transmission through needle stick injury in France (Lancet 1998;351:498)
and J Langgartner, et al., in another German hospital (J Infect
2002;44:269-70).

Indonesia: Dengue Fever Kills 26 in West Java
---------------------------------------------------
26 out of 496 people affected by dengue fever in 27 sub-districts in
Cirebon regency, West Java, died in the 6 months since January 2003, local
health officials said on Thu 17 Jul 2003. Herry Septjanti, a senior
official at the Cirebon health office, said the areas worst hit by the
epidemic included Weru subdistrict, where at least 68 dengue fever cases
resulted in 3 deaths. The subdistricts of West Cirebon and North Cirebon
were also among the worst affected areas. There were at least 62 cases of
dengue fever and 3 deaths in West Cirebon, and 32 cases with one death in
North Cirebon.
Herry, who heads the office's disease prevention and eradication division,
said the increasing number of hemorrhagic fever cases was mainly due to a
lack of public awareness about how to maintain a healthy environment. "The
local people are less aware of the importance of good sanitation to prevent
and eradicate the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes that spread the illness," he
said. In order to control the disease, he said, his office had deployed
health officials to educate villagers on how to avoid being infected by
dengue fever.

China: 23 Cases of Dengue Fever Reported in Guangdong Province
-------------------------------------------------
South China's Guangdong Province had reported 23 cases of dengue fever by
Wed 16 Jul 2003, according to sources within the Guangdong Provincial
Health Department. All of the cases were reported in Guangzhou, capital of
the province. The main symptoms of dengue fever, a disease transmitted by
mosquitoes, are high fever, muscle pain, and headache. Local government and
health departments have adopted a series of measures to eliminate _Aedes_
mosquito breeding grounds and publicize methods for preventing the disease
from spreading in the region.

Vietnam: More than 9000 Dengue Fever Cases with 22 Deaths
---------------------------------------------------
More than 9000 people have been infected with dengue fever virus in Vietnam
in the first 6 months of this year, a 63 percent rise over the same period
in 2002, state media said on Saturday 19 Jul 2003. 22 people among the 9300
struck down with the disease died, the Tuoi Tre newspaper said, citing a
health ministry report.
The worst affected provinces were in the southern Mekong Delta region,
where moist and humid conditions provide ideal breeding grounds for
mosquitoes. The region accounted for more than 92 percent of cases,
according the Ministry's report.
Large outbreaks of dengue fever, which first appeared in Vietnam in 1969,
tend to occur every 4 or 5 years, according to health experts. Some 383
people died in the last such epidemic in 1998, which infected 234 866
people across the country, according to the World Health Organization.

Cambodia: Increased Frequency of Dengue Virus Type 4 Infection in Children
--------------------------------------------------
For the next 3 months, monsoons will push through Southeast Asia, drenching
the region with the daily downpours that sustain this lush region. With the
rains come mosquitoes. And at such places as the Angkor Hospital for
Children in this northwestern Cambodian town that means combating a growing
wave of dengue fever -- including the potentially deadly hemorrhagic form.
7 children there are being treated for dengue. And doctors are bracing for
almost 200 cases -- a sharp increase over the same period last year -- by
the time the monsoons subside. Dengue fever, caused by 4 closely related
viruses and found throughout the world's tropical zones, is spreading in
Southeast Asia in ways never seen, health officials say. The disease, which
is transmitted by mosquitoes that bite during the day, has begun to buck a
trend of occurring in cycles of 3-5 years and shows signs of becoming an
annual problem.
Children have become the main victims in Southeast Asia. In particular,
dengue virus type 4, which [is associated with dengue hemorrhagic fever]
and carries with it the highest [probability] of death, preys most commonly
on children younger than 7. Scientists do not know why children contract
dengue virus type 4 more often. The phenomenon has not been seen in Central
America, another hot spot for dengue fever, according to Dr. Chang Moh
Seng, the World Health Organization's regional dengue specialist.
And scientists have not pinpointed why the disease is occurring with more
frequency, although weather patterns, increased population density, and
virulent strains are among the possibilities. For a country like Cambodia,
which is struggling with a myriad of health issues, where about half its
12.2 million people are under 15, the prospect of dengue fever outbreaks
[changing from a cyclical phenomenon to an annual event] is daunting, said
Chang, who works in Phnom Penh, Cambodia's capital.
Cambodia recorded almost 12 000 cases of dengue in 2002; the death rate was
almost 2 percent. In 2002, cases of dengue are 50 percent higher than they
were at the same time in 2002. For the past 3 years, the government
received USD 150 000 annually from the US Agency for International
Development to fight dengue. Half of that amount went toward large-scale
larviciding -- spreading a chemical in city and town water supplies; the
chemical is toxic enough to kill mosquito larvae without endangering
people. This year, USAID has increased its annual contribution to USD 250 000.
The Ministry of Public Health in Thailand reported 24 000 dengue cases by
the end of May 2003, 23 of them fatal. This puts that country on track to
surpass the 108 905 cases recorded in 2002. In contrast, in 2000, the last
non-epidemic year, 18 617 cases were reported.
