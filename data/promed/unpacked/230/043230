The said posting included the text: "The last US outbreak was in 1971".
This information should stand corrected: the last outbreak of
Newcastle disease (NCD) in the USA, previous to the current one, was
recorded in game birds in California in June 1998, caused by
velogenic viscerotropic NCD virus. It was reported to the OIE on 8
Jun 1998; following the application of stamping-out policy and
surveillance and the completion of cleansing and disinfection, the
outbreak was considered eradicated on 10 Jul 1998 and all quarantines
released. Final report was sent to the OIE on 2 Oct 1998. - Mod. AS.
