Angola: Marburg Outbreak Toll Rises to 114
------------------------------------------
A total of 114 people in Angola, including an Italian doctor, have
died in an outbreak of the rare Marburg hemorrhagic fever, and health
officials said on Fri 25 Mar 2005 they feared that the deadly virus
could spread to Luanda.
2 people -- including the doctor who had been in direct contact with
Marburg patients -- had died in Luanda after coming to the capital
from northern Uige province to receive treatment, Filomeno Fortes,
department head for disease control at the health ministry told
Reuters.
A further 4 people in Luanda were also suspected of being infected
with Marburg hemorrhagic fever, but Fortes said all 6 cases in the
capital had come in from Uige. "Of the 6 cases we've had in Luanda,
we've had 2 deaths until now. All 6 came from Uige. None of these
represents a primary case from Luanda," Fortes said. "Our fear is
that if we don't control cases coming from Uige, there is a risk that
they could infect people in Luanda," he added.
The health ministry had sent mobile teams across Luanda to test
suspect cases and to check up on people who had been in contact with
identified cases, with hospital chiefs also putting in place
preparatory measures in case of a local outbreak. Health ministry
spokesman Carlos Alberto, speaking to Reuters by phone from Uige,
confirmed 112 people in the province about 225 km (140 miles) north
of Luanda had died from Marburg fever but said the death toll could
be even higher. "We've only registered cases dealt with in hospitals,
but it's possible people have also died in their homes without coming
to hospital," Alberto said.
With a health infrastructure shattered by decades of civil war,
Angola is facing a monumental challenge in trying to combat the
virus. The 1st case was detected late in 2004, and so far most of the
victims have been children. "We've already had some help from the
international community but more help would be welcome. We need
cleaning materials, medicines, protective clothing, that kind of
thing," Alberto said.

Angola: Marburg Fever Outbreak Death Toll Rising
------------------------------------------------
The death toll in an outbreak of the deadly Ebola-like Marburg virus
in Angola has risen to 113, according to health officials. 3/4 of the
deaths were children under the age of 5 years, according to the World
Health Organisation.
"The death toll is 111 ... in the Uige provincial hospital," Carlos
Alberto, a Health Ministry spokesman, told Agence France Presse (AFP)
from Uige, about 300km north of Luanda. The provincial health
director for Luanda, Vita Mvemba, said there were 2 deaths in the
capital. "We have registered one death at the Josina Machel hospital
of a 15-year-old boy who had been to the Uige province ... and a case
of an Italian doctor, who had also been to Uige, who died on Thursday
night in the Sagrada Esperanca cinic," Mvemba said.
The Italian non-governmental organisation Medici con l'Africa Cuamm
[Collegio Universitario Aspiranti e Medici Missionari] from Rome
identified the doctor as a paediatrician who worked for the United
Nations and had been a volunteer in Africa for the past 11 years. She
had been practising for the past 2 years in the Uige provincial
hospital, the organisation said.
Alberto said on Friday that a Vietnamese doctor was among those ill
with the disease. "He is not dead," Alberto said, without giving a
precise number of sick in the country. "The situation is stable. We
are continuing to look for active signs in the community, hoping to
detect more cases of infected people," he said.
Mvemba added that 5 cases of Marburg have been detected in Luanda
including the 2 dead. One of the sick was at the Josina Machel
Hospital, Mvemba said, while "2 other cases had been admitted", one
at the Lucrecia Paim Maternal Ward and one child at the Cacuaco
Health Centre on the outskirts of northern Luanda.
Marburg hemorrhagic fever was first identified in 1967, affecting
laboratory workers in the central German town of Marburg as well as
in Frankfurt and Belgrade who had come into contact with infected
monkeys from Uganda. The largest outbreak on record of the Marburg
virus occurred from late 1998 to 2000 in the Democratic Republic of
Congo, killing 123 people.
Emergency efforts were under way, and on Thu 24 Mar 2005 the European
Union pledged 500 000 euros (USD 650 000) to help fight the outbreak.
The EU money was offered to the Spanish arm of Medecins sans
Frontieres (MSF) to provide protective suits, gloves and goggles,
water-purification equipment and tanks, intravenous fluids and
antibiotics. Angolan health officials assisted by WHO experts and MSF
(Doctors without Borders) teams and the US Centres for Disease
Control were in Uige to try to shore up measures to stamp out the
outbreak.
Angolan health officials have been battling to contain the outbreak
detected in October [2004] in the town that has claimed the lives of
scores of children. A total of 5 nurses have died over the past weeks
from the virus, which is transmitted through contact with bodily
fluids of infected people. Victims of the Marburg virus can suffer
from a severe watery diarrhoea, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting
early on in the illness followed by severe chest and lung pains, sore
throat and cough, according to the WHO. Many cases result in severe
bleeding, beginning from the 5th day and affecting the
gastrointestinal tract and the lungs, accompanied by a rash,
sometimes involving the entire body.

Angola: Marburg Virus Hemorrhagic Fever: Outbreak Notice
-----------------------------------------------------
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have confirmed
the presence of Marburg virus in 9 of 12 specimens submitted from an
outbreak of suspected acute hemorrhagic fever syndrome in Uige
Province in northern Angola. Laboratory testing was conducted by
CDC's Special Pathogens Branch on 21 Mar 2005. According to a World
Health Organization (WHO) report, 102 cases, including 95 deaths,
have been identified in a retrospective analysis that traced the
outbreak to October 2004. Approximately 75 percent of the reported
cases were in children younger than 5 years of age; males and females
were affected almost equally. Predominant symptoms have included
fever, hemorrhage, vomiting, cough, diarrhea, and jaundice.
The Ministry of Health in Angola is working with WHO and other
partners in conducting an investigation and public health response.
CDC laboratory testing confirming Marburg virus was performed using a
combination of polymerase chain reaction and antigen-detection ELISA.
CDC remains in close communication with WHO about the situation in
Angola.
Marburg hemorrhagic fever is caused by a virus that is believed to
primarily inhabit countries in East and Central Africa. Although the
disease is rare, it has the potential to spread to other people,
especially health-care staff and family members who care for the
patient.

[So far both the confirmed cases (both of whom have died) and the 4
suspected cases (all still alive) of Marburg hemorrhagic fever in
Luanda, the capital city of Angola, have originated in the northern
province of Uige where the outbreak is centered, and there has been
no transmission of infection locally in the capital city. - Mod.CP]
