Farmers should not underestimate the black streaked dwarf rice
disease, which has been causing widespread panic because of its
complicated development and unexpected consequences, according to
agricultural officials.

The warning was made after farmers at some northern locales reported
that infected crops had shown signs of recovery. Tran Xuan Dinh, Thai
Binh Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, said that the
rice may look healthy on the outside, but the disease may still be
affecting its quality, and farmers could see poor harvests and heavy
losses. He said that the disease had affected paddy fields in the
province last year [2009] and had ruined more than 3000 ha [approx
7400 acres] of rice.

Ngo Tien Dung, Plant Protection Department, said that there was
currently no way of stamping out the disease. A report showed that
currently 23 of the 41 provinces and cities have their rice fields
infected, covering a total area of over 20 360 ha [approx 50 000
acres]. About 10 percent of these fields were completely ruined. Thai
Binh was the worst-hit province, with nearly 18 000 ha [approx 44 000
acres] of infected rice. The disease was reported to have rapidly
spread across northern Lai Chau, Ninh Binh, and Bac Giang and in
central Thua Thien-Hue. In Ninh Binh, for example, more than 200 ha
[approx 500 acres] of rice were found to be infected with the disease
each day. Initial tests showed that rice fields in 5 disease-free
districts in the province were also showing signs of stunting. Thus,
more than 700 ha [approx 1700 acres] of infected rice were pulled up.

Bui Si Doanh, Plant Protection Department, said the State would
supply agrochemicals, financial support, and rice for each person for
the next 6 months. Vice minister Bui Ba Bong said that the disease
was predicted to be more complicated than last year [2009]. Thus,
farmers should keep an eye on their fields and promptly report any
problems to local authorities.

[Black streaked dwarf disease (BSDD) of rice due to _Rice black
streaked dwarf virus_ (RBSDV; genus _Fijivirus_) is known to cause
serious crop losses in South-East Asia. Symptoms include darkening
and distortion of leaves, black streaked tumours along leaf veins,
and severe stunting of plants. It also affects some other
graminaceous hosts including maize, wheat, oat and barley and is
spread by planthoppers including _Laodelphax striatellus_ and
_Unkanodes_ species.

In 2009, the spread of a new virus associated with BSDD symptoms, but
transmitted by the white backed planthopper (WBPH, _Sogatella
furcifera_), which is not a vector of RBSDV, was reported from
southern China and northern Viet Nam. The new virus has been
tentatively named Southern rice black streaked dwarf virus (SRBSDV).
RBSDV and the closely related _Maize rough dwarf virus_ (MRDV) have
both been classed into the serogroup 2 of _Fijivirus_, and SRBSDV
appears to belong to the same group. Disease management for rice
viruses includes cultural practices, vector control, and use of
cultivars with reduced sensitivity or resistance to the virus, the
vector, or both.

Besides BSDD, other rice virus diseases are also being reported from
Viet Nam (see ProMED-mail posts listed below). While the new SRBSDV
and an increase in WBPH numbers in the region are doubtless a major
concern, it is not certain that the disease statistics in the item
above are confirmed to be only due to SRBSDV, or whether they may
represent the combined effect of several of the rice viruses.
