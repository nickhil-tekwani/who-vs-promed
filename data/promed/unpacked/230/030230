Bird flu outbreak in Belgium
----------------------------
A highly contagious poultry disease -- dubbed 'bird flu' -- has
spread to Belgium, prompting the Federal government and the European
Commission to swiftly act to contain it.
Since traces of the avian influenza were discovered in Limburg
province on 15 Apr 2003, the Belgian government has ordered the
slaughter of some 250 000 birds.
Fearing the economic damage that could be done to the poultry
industry, the European Commission has decided to "reinforce the
control measures" already put in place by the Belgian government. It
has asked that no poultry or hatching eggs be allowed to leave
Belgium to other EU member states or third countries.
According to La Libre Belgique, the large supermarkets in Belgium are
not yet too concerned. Louis-Philippe Ouwerx, spokesperson for
Carrefour Belgium, said "We are not concerned ... All the quality and
control measures have been taken."
Member state experts will get together to discuss the emergency
measures imposed on Belgium on 25 Apr 2003.

Belgium bans poultry transport as bird flu suspected
-----------------------------------------------------
Belgium slapped a ban on transport of live poultry and eggs after the
discovery of a suspected case of bird flu, which is already
afflicting farms in the Netherlands. Authorities concluded that there
was a "serious suspicion" that the illness had spread into the
country, after the possible case was reported in northeastern Belgium
on Wednesday, near the Dutch border.
The federal food safety agency AFSCA, which revealed the suspect case
in the commune of Meeuwen-Gruitrode, announced a ban on the transport
of live birds and poultry, day-old chicks, and hatching eggs. The ban
also applies to the transport of eggs for consumption from poultry
farms -- although not those already in the distribution system -- as
well as of pigs, cattle, goats, horses, and manure from the same
farms. The Belgian farm where the suspect case was been found is
within a buffer zone set up on 4 Apr 2003 after cases were found a
few kilometers away in the south of the Netherlands.
Dutch authorities last month launched a mass cull of chickens after
the discovery of suspected cases of bird flu. Bird flu, also known as
avian influenza, is viral disease that is highly contagious to
chickens, turkeys, ducks, and other birds but not dangerous for
humans or other animals.
Belgian authorities have also ordered the slaughter of all poultry
within a 3-kilometer (2-mile) radius of the affected farm, which
houses some 10 500 hatching chickens. The European Commission has
been informed of the suspect case and the measures taken, AFSCA said.
The Dutch poultry sector is one of Europe's largest. In 2001 the
Netherlands exported 7.9 billion eggs with a total value of 427
million euros, while the export of poultry meat brought in almost one
billion euros.
In Hong Kong a bird flu outbreak in February [2003?] claimed the life
of one man but Dutch virologists say the Hong Kong case is a
different, more dangerous strain of the virus than that in the
Netherlands.

Avian Influenza in Belgium: Commission adopts control measures
--------------------------------------------------------------
Following a suspected outbreak of avian influenza Belgium on 15 Apr
2003, the Commission adopted a decision today to reinforce the
control measures already put in place by the Belgian authorities.
Avian influenza is a highly contagious poultry disease that can cause
severe economic damage to the poultry industry.
Suspicion of an outbreak of avian influenza in the province of
Limburg arose yesterday. The Belgian authorities, in cooperation with
the Commission services, immediately put in place measures foreseen
in Directive 92/40/EC. Additional more stringent measures have been
adopted by Belgium.
The Commission Decision adopted today reinforces these measures by
defining them at the EU level. The Commission Decision specifies that
no live poultry, hatching eggs or fresh, unprocessed poultry manure
or litter may be dispatched from Belgium to other Member States or
third countries. They may also not be transported within Belgium.
However, in view of the specificity of poultry production, the
Belgian veterinary authority may authorise certain movements of
hatching eggs, day-old chicks, ready-to-lay pullets, and poultry for
immediate slaughter within Belgium. Strict rules will also apply for
the collection, storage, and transport of table eggs. Bio-security
and hygiene measures, including cleaning and disinfection procedures
at all levels of poultry and egg production, should be reinforced by
Belgium to prevent the further spread of the disease.
The measures contained in the Commission Decision are applicable
until 25 Apr 2003 and will be reviewed at the meeting of the Standing
Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health scheduled for 23 Apr
2003. The urgent measures adopted by the Commission could then be
updated to take into account the development of the situation.
The Commission will continue to work closely with the Belgian
authorities to ensure proper coordination within the EU.

[The Belgian Animal Health and Animal Products Department, Federal
State Service for Public Health, Food Chain Safety and Environment
(In French -- AFSCA, in Flemish --FAVV:
<http://www.favv.fgov.be/indexNL.htm>) has published 3 press
releases on the issue since 16 Apr 2003. According to those, a
seriously suspected case of avian influenza was reported in
Meeuwen-Gruitrode (province of Limburg) on Tue, 15 Apr 2003. The
initial laboratory results were received during the night 15/16 Apr
2003.
Subsequently, the ASSCA/FAVV decided to impose a standstill
throughout the entire country, coming into effect on Wed 16 Apr 2003,
12.00 noon. This includes also a ban on all movements of ungulates
from farms where poultry are kept as well. Table eggs are not allowed
to leave poultry farms.
The affected farm is situated within the buffer zone, adjacent to the
Dutch border, established on 4 Apr 2003. Initial investigations have
not revealed any previous contacts with the Netherlands. 8 poultry
farms within a radius of 3 km of the affected farm have already been
depopulated. - Mod.AS]
