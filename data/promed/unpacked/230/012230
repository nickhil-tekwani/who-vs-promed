2 avian flu cases in wild birds in Bavaria
------------------------------------------
2 samples from dead wild birds have tested positive for H5N1 virus for the
1st time in Bavaria. As reported today [28 Feb 2006] in Munich by the
minister for consumer protection, Werner Schnappauf, the avian flu virus
was detected in a mute swan (_Cygnus olor_) from the town of Schwabstadl in
the district Landsberg am Lech, and in a wild mallard duck (_Anas
platyrhynchos_) from the town of Sachsenkam in the district Bad Tolz
Wolfratshausen.
"Countermeasures as required by the regulations for wild bird-avian
influenza have been completely implemented by those responsible for
epidemic control in those districts," stated Mr Schnappauf in German.
"Bavaria has been ready for this event, ever since the movement of the
avian flu infection made it clear that it was only a matter of time before
Bavaria itself would have its 1st case."
Now it is necessary to do everything to prevent the virus from infecting
poultry resources. Even if avian flu does not present an immediate danger
to humans, it presents one for poultry farmers through severe economic
damage. That is why there are strict hygiene measures and trade
restrictions for poultry farmers in the protective zones. The EU reference
laboratory in Weybridge has yet to confirm whether this represents the
highly pathogenic type of Asian virus.
The districts have erected around the points of discovery a restricted area
within a 3-km radius and an observation area within a 10-km radius. The
protection zones around the upper Bavarian Landsberg discovery point also
reach into the Schwabian district of Augsburg-Land. All the poultry farmers
in the affected 3 districts have been identified and are being informed.
The discovery points have been sealed off. The 2 animals were isolated
finds; larger numbers of dead birds have not been discovered.
The swan was found dead on 20 Feb 2006 in the district of Landsberg am
Lech, near Schwabstadel, and was sent to the district Office for Health and
Food Safety in Oberschleissheim.
When the rapid influenza A test (by reverse transcriptase PCR, requiring 48
hours to perform) was positive, the swan was sent to the National Reference
Laboratory of the Friedrich Loffler Institute on the island of Riems.
The duck from the upper Bavarian district of Bad Tolz was found near
Sachsenkam on 20 Feb 2006 and was sent to the reference laboratory at Riems
on 24 Feb 2006.
During the period of 16-25 Feb 2006, there have been 733 samples from wild
birds sent to Office for Health and Food Safety. 595 samples have been tested.
The Friedrich Loffler Institute confirmed H5N1 in the 2 samples up until
today [28 Feb 2006]. The Friedrich Loffler Institute has 9 more samples
from Bavaria yet to test. In the 3 km diameter area around the discovery
point, a restricted area was set up, where, within the next 21 days, the
following steps are being taken: Living poultry and caught birds of other
types are regularly examined on a clinical basis. Taking them out of this
inspection condition is prohibited ("stand still").
Fertilized eggs and one-day old chicks cannot be removed from a poultry
farm. Fresh poultry meat, ground poultry meat, meat parts or products, as
well as prepared poultry meat or bird meat, cannot be brought in or out of
a poultry farm.
By-products cannot be brought into or out of the poultry farms as well.
Poultry urine or waste are not permitted to be brought outside of the
protective zone.
After 21 days, and up to 30 days since the official declaration of
infection, any transport out of the poultry farm has to have official
permission. Beyond the protective zone is an at least 10 km observation
zone around the discovery point. Within the observation zone, the following
rules are in force:
In the period of 15 days after the official declaration of an infection,
living poultry or captured birds of other sorts cannot be transported
outside. During the 30-day period after the infection declaration,
permission is required to bring poultry and captured birds of other types
into the observation zone.
There are 20 poultry farms in the restricted area around the district of
Landberg am Lech, the largest with 150 chickens; the remaining have between
10-30 birds. In the restricted area of the district of Bad
Tolz-Wolfratshausen, there are 5 small poultry farms, and in the
observation area, there are 46 small poultry farms.

[2] Germany: bird flu: are pet cats at risk?

Bird flu: Are pet cats at risk?
-------------------------------
The discovery of a German cat that died of bird flu -- the 1st mammal found
with the H5N1 virus in Central Europe -- raises stark questions for pet
owners across the world. How easily can avian flu jump from birds to
domestic animals? If a pet gets sick, should the owners be worried about
their own health?
Scientists have known for at least 2 years that felines could catch the
deadly bird flu virus. It was found in 2004 in Thailand in 2 domestic cats.
Big cats who had been fed infected chicken carcasses in a Thai zoo were
also killed by H5N1. And last year [2005], wild civet cats died after
contracting the virus. So the discovery of the dead German cat in an area
where dozens of birds had died from H5N1 does not come as a big surprise.

Avian influenza in cat in Germany
---------------------------------
The World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) has been informed that a cat
infected with the H5N1 virus has been found in the island of Ruegen in Germany.
According to the Friedrich-Loeffler Institut (FLI), an OIE reference
laboratory for avian influenza, a cat had been found and was examined
during the week end for a common influenza infection and was then sent to
the AI reference laboratory for further investigation. The samples analyzed
resulted positive for the H5N1 virus. Further investigations are currently
being undertaken in order to assess if the isolated strain is similar to
the one isolated from the wild swans on the island.
This is not the first time that felines have been naturally infected with
the H5N1 virus. An episode occurred in 2004 in a zoo in Bangkok where more
than 40 tigers died and many others were culled due to the infection. On
that occasion, investigations showed that the tigers were fed entire
carcasses of chickens most likely infected with H5N1. The tigers may have
been infected by either inhalation of large amounts of virus that could
have been present on the surface/feathers of the poultry carcasses (faecal
contamination) or via ingestion of the entire carcasses, including
intestines and faeces.
Also other "natural" fatal cases of H5N1 have been reported in domestic
cats in Asia. Cats are known to be susceptible to the H5N1 virus. Under
experimental conditions cat-to-cat transmission of H5N1 virus has also been
demonstrated.
The OIE stresses that, as of today, all the natural cases in feline have
not led to any change in the epidemiology of the disease, which has
fundamentally remained a bird disease nor have they led to any recognized
virus change in epidemiology or mutation leading to an increased virulence
of the virus for felines or other mammals.
The detection of the H5N1 virus in cat in Germany shows the high degree of
alertness and the very effective surveillance system in place in Europe.
This report comes one day after the conclusion of the two days OIE meeting
of chief veterinary officers of the European region, where the importance
of the early detection of the H5N1 virus in the control of the disease has
once again been underlined.
The OIE supports the recommendation of the European Centre for Disease
Control (ESDC) to cat owners, to take animals to the veterinary surgeons in
case of the appearance of signs of heavy colds in cats that had free run in
areas where the H5N1 virus has been detected.

Switzerland finds 2nd bird flu case in dead swan
------------------------------------------------
Switzerland has found its 2nd case of H5 bird flu in a dead swan close to
the German border, but said on Wednesday [1 Mar 2006] it would be another
week before it is known whether it is the more aggressive H5N1 form of the
virus.
The swan was found close to the town of Kreuzlingen at the northwestern
corner of Lake Constance -- also known as Bodensee -- where 2 wild ducks
have tested positive on the German side, the Federal Veterinary Office.
On Sunday [26 Feb 2006], Switzerland confirmed its 1st case of H5 bird flu
in a duck found in the heart of Geneva, near the city's famous jet d'eau
fountain. Final test results are still awaited.
The country has been on high alert for bird flu since the virus emerged in
neighbors France, Germany, Austria and Italy.
From last month [February 2006], it ordered that all poultry be kept
indoors for an indefinite period to lessen the risk from the fast-spreading
H5N1 virus that has led to the preventive culling of many millions of birds
worldwide.
