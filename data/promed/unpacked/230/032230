The infectious bursal disease (IBD) outbreak in Darla, Chukha, killed about 800 chicks in 4 commercial pullet-rearing farms between 16 and 28 Dec 2022. This is the 2nd outbreak in as many years.

Following the outbreak, the movement of poultry products from Chhumidlakha village under Darla gewog remains restricted until the disease subsides or is fully under control.

On 25 Dec 2022, the gewog office was informed about the outbreak while the 1st outbreak in the community occurred on 16 Dec 2022.

Chukha Dzongkhag Chief Livestock Officer Sherub Tenzin said that the outbreak was not reported on time. "It was late by the time they reported to us," he said.

"The outbreak occurred because the chickens were not given full vaccination against IBD and also due to improper hygiene on the farms. Last year [2021] too the outbreak occurred in the same community," he said.

Sherub Tenzin said despite awareness programmes to prevent such diseases and keep their birds healthy, the outbreaks occur because of the carelessness of some poultry owners.

The control measures are put in place and farmers are advised to step up biosecurity measures to prevent further widespread.

"We have cordoned the community, it is under observation," he said, adding that other nearby farms that are at risk of getting infected have also been closely monitored.

The dzongkhag [district] livestock officials said the farm owners have to bear the loss and will not be compensated given that the outbreak mainly occurred due to their carelessness.

IBD is an acute and highly contagious viral infection seen mainly in chickens of 2 to 6 weeks of age.

[2] France: IBDV reassortment

Although cases of Gumboro disease causing high mortality in broilers have become very rare, the avian infectious bursal disease virus is still circulating in [France]. This is confirmed by a recent study, carried out by the Ceva laboratory. The study made it possible to detect the presence of a new type of reassortant virus of Gumboro disease in several French regions.

Between January 2021 and August 2022, these viruses were identified 84 times, in batches taken on a targeted or random basis [map of geographical distribution at https://tinyurl.com/48ems7a5]. "In the cases of analysis carried out during subclinical suspicions with regularly degraded [flock's] performance, the virus was detected in 1 out of 2 batches. Analysis carried out on batches taken at random showed the presence of the virus in 1 batch out of 5," detailed Simon Mouchel, poultry technical and marketing manager of Ceva during the technical day of the association of poultry technicians of Ploufragan.

The particularity of these reassortant viruses is their endowment with a VP2 protein from a very virulent virus (vvIBDV) and a VP1 protein from a classic virus. They must be identified by a specific PCR analysis and by genetic sequencing; the usual methods not always making it possible to highlight them. This type of reassortant virus has been detected since 2010 in Northern Europe.

"The clinical signs are not very marked (depression, but not always visible) but the virus has an immunosuppressive effect, with consequences on performance (consumption index, GMQ, heterogeneity) and the development of intercurrent pathologies which can lead to [application of] antibiotic therapy. This has been observed in broiler farming as well as in laying hens."

The solutions for combating this reassortant virus remain the combination of vaccination and biosecurity. Cleaning and disinfection of the building must be enforced, because the non-enveloped Gumboro virus is very resistant in the environment.

[Infectious bursal disease (IBD, Gumboro disease) is a worldwide avian disease caused by a virus that is now classified as a member of the genus _Avibirnavirus_ of the family _Birnaviridae_. Although turkeys, ducks, guinea fowl, and ostriches may be infected, clinical disease occurs solely in chickens. Only young birds are clinically affected. Severe acute disease of birds 3 to 6 weeks old is associated with high mortality, but a less acute or subclinical disease is common in 0 to 3 week old birds. This can cause secondary problems due to the effect of the virus on the bursa of Fabricius (a thymus-like lymphoid gland in birds, the site of B cell maturation).

IBD virus (IBDV) causes lymphoid depletion of the bursa, and if this occurs in the first 2 weeks of life, significant depression of the humoral antibody response may result. Two serotypes of IBDV, designated serotypes 1 and 2, are recognised. Clinical disease has been associated only with serotype 1, against which all commercial vaccines are prepared. Some antigenic variants of serotype 1 IBDV may require special vaccines for maximum protection. Very virulent strains of serotype 1 IBDV are common worldwide and cause serious disease. Both live attenuated and inactivated (killed) vaccines are available to control the disease.

Some of the above and additional information on IBD/Gumboro, a WOAH-listed avian disease, is available at https://www.woah.org/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/3.03.12_IBD.pdf.

The IBDV reassortment issue has been recently addressed in a paper (see ref below) based upon observations in Latvia (Communicated by ProMED Rapporteur Mahmoud Orabi). Its abstract follows:

"Infectious bursal disease virus is an immunosuppressive pathogen that, despite applied vaccination, is affecting the poultry industry worldwide. This report presents the genetic and pathotypic characterization of a natural reassortant emerging in Europe (Latvia). Genetic characterization showed that strain 25/11/Latvia/2011 represents genotype A3B1, whose segment A is derived from very virulent strains, while segment B is from the classic-like genogroup. Phylogenetic maximum likelihood inference of the B-segment sequence clustered the reassortant strain together with the US antigenic variant E strain. However, the obtained full-length sequence of 25/11/Latvia/2011 revealed that not only reassortment but also dozens of mutations shaped the unique genetic makeup. Phenotypic characterization showed no mortality and no clinical signs of disease but a severe bursa of Fabricius atrophy and splenomegaly in the convalescent birds at 10 days post infection. The results obtained indicate that the acquired genetic constellation contributed to a decrease in virulence; nevertheless, the infection causes severe damage to lymphoid organs, which can lead to impaired immune responses."
