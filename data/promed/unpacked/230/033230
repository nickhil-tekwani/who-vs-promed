Ovine Johnes Disease (OJD) discovered in marsupials
-----------------------------------------------------
In a startling discovery in South Australia, it's been confirmed a number
of native animals on Kangaroo Island are infected with Ovine Johne's Disease.
More than 30 sheep flocks on the island are infected with the sheep wasting
disease, which prompted the State's Primary Industries Department to test
some of the local marsupials.
Veterinarians confirmed 2 kangaroos and 2 wallabies were carrying OJD.
Department vet, Paul Cleland who headed the study, says the find may not
necessarily mean kangaroos or wallabies were the source of infection on the
island.
Paul Cleland said, "We've got to reserve judgement absolutely until we get
some more information in. We're waiting right at the moment for results of
tests to determine if the OJD bacteria can be recovered from the feces of
macropods and if so, just how many bugs are present. And that's a very,
very important bit of information in determining whether those animals are
capable of infecting sheep, or other wallabies and kangaroos."

[Ovine-Johnes, like Johnes in other animals, is caused by _Mycobacterium
avium_ subsp. _paratuberculosis_. It causes a wasting condition
characterized by gradual but profound emaciation. In sheep, death generally
occurs within 6 months. According to the New South Wales Agricultural
Department, mortality in flocks seems to be low, with the disease seen
primarily in older sheep. However, in flocks with heavy infestation,
animals less than 2 years old may die from it. The disease is endemic in
NSW, Victoria, and Tasmania and has been reported in the southeast of South
Australia.

It will be interesting to know the outcome of research with disease in
kangaroos. Did the sheep infect the kangaroos? Or, can kangaroos infect
sheep? Hopefully, these questions will be answered by research surrounding
this discovery. ­ Mod.TG]
