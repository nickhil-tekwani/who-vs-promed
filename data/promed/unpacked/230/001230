re: ProMED-mail Anthrax, human, bovine - India: (AP) 20090511.1763
------------------------------------------------------------------
This is nothing new here. We face this almost every year; more during the
monsoon season when the cases are much higher. These always originate from
the Araku agency areas. The Government claims to have taken all precautions
but there is no let-up in the cases every year.

On our part we have and continue to request the Animal Husbandry to check
our cattle on a regular basis by their vets designated apart from our own
medical protocols every year. We follow strictly every year the entire
vaccinations and this for precaution as we are close to the border of
Orissa and hardly 70 km (43.5 mi) from Araku.

It is [known] that 80 per cent of the cattle sold in the market from these
areas are affected with contagious diseases like foot and mouth and anthrax
also. We have all the documentation based on our [checking] incoming animals.

[This message came via Merritt Clifton, editor of 'Animal People', who
commented: "I have many contacts in the Visakhapatnam area, near where the
anthrax outbreaks are occurring. I forwarded your posting to them, and
received back the following from Pradeep Kumar Nath, founder of the Visakha
SPCA (now one of the largest in India):" So I think we can assume that the
situation is as bad as it appears to be. Merritt -- Many thanks. - Mod.MHJ]

6 new anthrax cases confirmed
-----------------------------
Six new cases of cutaneous anthrax were detected among Kondhs -- a
primitive tribal group -- at Karlapodur and Hatikal hamlets in Laxmipuram
panchayat, about 20 km (12.4 mi) from [Munchingput, Visakhapatnam district]
and 200 km (124 mi) from Visakhapatnam even as the Health Department
stepped up its effort to contain the spread of the bacterial infection.

In new cases -- 5 of them from Karlapodur on Andhra-Orissa border [ages:
25, 20, 60, 28, 26] were confirmed after the Kondhus consumed the meat of a
cow carcass on [23 Apr 2009]. With this the number of patients affected by
anthrax after consuming dead meat/cutting the carcasses has increased to 65
since the 1st case was reported in March [2009]. "The infection is under
control," according to joint director of animal husbandry Y Simhachalam.
The [5] patients and the lone case from Hatikal, 17, developed skin
infection and multiple wounds on their body since past 2 to 7 days.

[A 35 year old man] from Hatikada who left King George Hospital (KGH) after
3 weeks of treatment against medical advice, was admitted to Paderu
Community Health Centre 2 days ago [10 May 2009]. [He] said he was happy at
Paderu as he was able to meet his relatives regularly. Asked as to why he
got discharged from KGH, he said that to take part in voting on the advice
of village elders, he discontinued the treatment.

Responding to the gravity of the situation and to educate the tribals
against consumption of dead meat, the CPI(M) [Communist Party of India
(Marxist)] opened gruel centres at Karlapodur and Mebha in Makalavaram
panchayat on Monday [11 May 2009].

Criticising the government's handling of the situation, Bhadrachalam MP Dr
Midiyam Babu Rao said there was total failure in vaccinating the cattle
both on Andhra-Orissa border, where anthrax cases were being reported
regularly since 2002. He said they would continue the gruel centres for a
month and open more at other problematic areas, and asked the government to
declare a medical emergency in the agency area and fill all the vacant
posts in the Health Department. CPI (M) district secretary Ch Narsinga Rao
said in proportionate to the population of tribals, Rs 6000 crores [about
USD 1.2 billion] should have been allocated. But the government had spent
less than Rs 200 crores [about USD 40.5 million] and people were still
dying for want of potable water.

[Since yesterday's (11 May 2009) report the total number of human cases has
increased to "65", which is slightly more than 51 + 6 but still within the
bounds of normal newspaper reporting. It is always difficult to know
whether reporters separate the living from the dead when reporting "cases"
or give the current total, which can include the dead. Our thanks to
Merritt for forwarding these 2 accounts.
