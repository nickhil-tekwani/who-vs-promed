Health risks increase in Guyana with leptospirosis, vector-borne diseases
--------------------------------------------------
Leptospirosis has become a health concern in Guyana, as the number of
cases continues to rise and 43 people were being treated for
suspected cases of the bacterial disease, which is usually caused by
exposure to water contaminated with the urine of infected animals.
The people of Guyana refer to it as 'the Flood Disease.' 2 deaths
have been confirmed as being related to leptospirosis, and another 9
suspected cases are being investigated, according to PAHO. The rapid
increase in suspected cases of leptospirosis has led to an overburden
of the Georgetown Public Hospital, which is the only public hospital
for Georgetown and the East Coast. All day people were lined up to
get doxycyline as prophylactic treatment.
Dr. Bernadette Theodore-Gandi, PAHO/WHO representative in Guyana,
warned that health workers should not to focus solely on
leptospirosis.
"Leptospirosis has a wide range of symptoms that can mimic other
diseases. We should be careful not to overlook the other diseases
that may be a result of the flood, such as tuberculosis or
pneumonia," she said. "In the coming weeks we should also be very
alert to cases of vector-borne and water and food-borne diseases. The
floods created an enormous breeding capacity for mosquitoes. We have
to take into account that this may also lead to outbreaks of dengue."
PAHO is actively monitoring new cases of leptospirosis and
collaborating closely with the Ministry of Health in Guyana to
prevent a further increase in cases. Prophylaxis is being distributed
on a large scale in the flooded areas, with 120 000 persons already
receiving a weekly preventive dose of 200 mg of doxycycline. People
coming from the flooded areas to mobile clinics who show symptoms of
leptospirosis receive treatment.
The emergency unit at Georgetown Public Hospital was overwhelmed by
people complaining of nausea, headaches and fevers. A number of these
patients have been admitted to hospital with suspected leptospirosis.
Dr. Hedwig Goede, Health Systems Advisor at PAHO Guyana, says she is
worried about the capacity of the hospital to deal with this overflow
of patients. "The hospital is in need of more beds. Even now, people
are doubling up in beds. Furthermore there is an urgent need for
personal assistance from health workers and nurses."
Guyana is already mobilizing retired nurses to return to the
hospital. PAHO offered financial support to facilitate the
recruitment and employment of retired nurses. PAHO also relieves the
immediate need for additional space by facilitating 200 renovated
cots and the purchase of extra mattresses. Georgetown Public Hospital
has relocated the psychiatric clinic from the hospital in order to
create room for the extra patients with flood-related diseases.

Travel Warning - Guyana
----------------------------
This information is current as of Wed, 9 Feb 2005. This Travel
Warning updates American citizens on risks posed by flood-related
conditions in Guyana, and replaces the Travel Warning issued 19 Jan
2005.
On 19 Jan 2005, the Department of State authorized the departure of
non-emergency personnel and family members of the USA Embassy because
of health and sanitation risks associated with flooding. The
Department continues to urge its citizens to defer travel to Guyana
at this time.
USA citizens currently in Guyana should carefully evaluate their
personal situation, review their travel documents, and consider
departing Guyana while commercial means of doing so are available.
Flooding has subsided in most of the city of Georgetown, however some
areas along the east coast remain flooded. The government of Guyana
continues to monitor water levels in the dams for possible breaches
or overflowing. If the rains persist, conditions could worsen rapidly
and the roads could become inaccessible. The consular section of the
USA Embassy in Georgetown may not be able to assist American citizens
in some regions under the present conditions.
Health and sanitation issues are a major concern in all the affected
regions. There remains a high risk of water-borne infection, and
there have been 5 confirmed deaths from flood-related illnesses. The
water system in Georgetown and affected areas should be considered
compromised.

Death Toll From "Lepto" In Guyana Rises
--------------------------------------
The death toll in Guyana has now climbed to 16, according to the
country's Ministry of Health, with several deaths being blamed on the
water-borne disease leptospirosis, or "lepto," as it's now being
referred to by Guyanese. A Kaieteur News reporter is suspected to be
one of the latest victims, along with the chairman of the Plaisance/
Industry Neighborhood District Council.
Relatives are now awaiting post-mortem reports for the cause of
death, though both exhibited symptoms of the disease, such as fever
and vomiting.
The 31-year-old reporter, who apparently succumbed to the disease on
Mon, 7 Feb 2005, was also a calypsonian who won the calypso monarchy
some years ago with the hit song "Pagalee Man." Information Liaison
to President Bharrat Jagdeo, Robert Persaud, expressed his profound
sympathy to the family and friends of the reporter, calling it "a
blow to our local media pool." The man, according to Kaieteur News
reports, had been hospitalized at the Georgetown Hospital, but was
only placed in the ICU on Sun, 6 Feb 2005 after his condition
deteriorated.
The 73-year-old politician, a stalwart member of the People's
National Congress Reform, also died on Mon, 7 Feb 2005. He was a
retired public servant and for many years was the country's director
of Youth Affairs in the Ministry of Youth and Sport.
