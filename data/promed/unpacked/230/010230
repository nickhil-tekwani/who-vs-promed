In response to the very informative summary of JE vaccination
activities in Uttar Pradesh (UP) [India], as provided by Dr. T. Jacob
John on 1 Sep 2008 [Archive 20080901.2738], PATH would like to add
the following details: Building off high coverage reported in 7
districts of UP in 2006 (99.9 percent of the target population of 6.8
million children aged 1 - 15 years), JE vaccination campaigns
continued in high-risk districts through 2007 and 2008. In 2007, the
target population was 9.8 million in 11 endemic districts, with
reported coverage of 9.5 million (96.7 percent). In 2008, the target
population was 10.8 million in 9 endemic districts, and reported
coverage was 10.7 million (98.8 percent). In total, since GOI
(Government of India) implemented JE vaccination campaigns in 2006,
27 million children in 27 districts of UP have been vaccinated; 43
million in high-risk districts throughout all of India. The GOI has
developed and funded the JE control strategy, with technical support
provided by PATH, UNICEF, and WHO.

Earlier this year [2008], UNICEF began conducting JE vaccination
coverage evaluation surveys in UP, with data forthcoming. Recognizing
that routine surveillance is critical to measuring the impact of
vaccination on disease burden, GOI (Immunization Division and the
National Vector-borne Disease Control Program) are focusing efforts
on strengthening acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) surveillance
throughout the country and improving laboratory capacity for
confirmation of AES causes.

Routine immunization is also a crucial follow-up activity to JE
vaccination campaigns to ensure that the annual birth cohort is
protected. Logistical challenges between district, state, and
national levels regarding communications and supply have delayed the
introduction of comprehensive, routine JE immunization in many areas
covered in India's vaccination campaigns. However, health officials
are working at all levels to improve routine JE immunization
programs, ensure stable supply, standardize reporting, implement
strong communications, and resolve other logistical challenges. GOI
is preparing guidelines for introduction of routine JE immunization.
State-level workshops conducted with support from PATH are
identifying specific barriers and setting plans for rapidly addressing them.

[ProMED thanks Dr. Wecker for providing the details of the JE virus
vaccination campaign in UP. The numbers of individuals vaccinated is
impressive. It would be interesting to know the estimated population
of susceptible individuals in the areas of high risk that are
included in the campaign. The development of laboratory diagnostic
capability will be of particular value in determining the etiological
agents responsible for the acute encephalitis syndrome that
physicians are reporting in the areas.
