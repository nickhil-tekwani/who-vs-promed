Health officials are warning the public about the dangers of trying to help wild animals after a woman who rescued a baby raccoon exposed 21 people in south Weld County to rabies.

According to a [Mon 2 Jul 2018] release from the Weld County Department of Public Health and Environment, the woman took the raccoon into her care after finding it on her property. Its mother had abandoned the animal.

Health officials said during its time with the unidentified Weld County woman, the raccoon was in contact with 21 people. That contact later became a serious health concern when the raccoon tested positive for rabies.

Rachel Freeman, the health communication supervisor of the Weld County Health Department, says health officials were alerted after the woman contacted an animal shelter to see if it would take in the raccoon.

The exposure is being called the largest in Weld County history. But it's unclear what steps were taken to limit the risk of infection to the 21 people who were in contact with the rabid raccoon. The release from the health department did not mention any human cases.

According to the Weld County Health Department, rabies is a disease caused by a virus affecting the nervous system. Rabies causes swelling of the brain and spinal cord and is fatal in both humans and animals. It is spread in saliva through the bite of an infected animal.

To prevent exposure to rabies,
- Leave orphaned animals alone. Baby animals often appear to be orphaned when they are not. The parent animal may not return if people are too close.
- Do not feed, touch, or handle wild animals, and be cautious of stray dogs and cats.
- Have dogs, cats, horses, and livestock vaccinated regularly by a licensed veterinarian.

If you do find a wild animal appearing to be sick, injured, or orphaned, contact your local Animal Control Officer, Colorado Parks and Wildlife, or a local veterinary office before attempting to move it.

Four people have been referred to health-care providers after they were possibly exposed to rabies by a kitten that tested positive for the disease.

According to the Department of Health and Environment Control (DHEC), the people were possibly exposed in Spartanburg County while handling the kitten. DHEC said the kitten was taken to DHEC's lab for testing on [Fri 29 Jun 2018], and rabies was confirmed on [Mon 2 Jul 2018].

"Rabies is usually transmitted through a bite that allows saliva from an infected animal to be introduced into the body of a person or another animal," David Vaughan, director, DHEC Onsite Wastewater, Rabies Prevention, and Enforcement Division, said in a news release. "However, saliva or neural-tissue contact with open wounds or areas such as the eyes, nose, or mouth could also potentially transmit rabies."

"To reduce the risk of getting rabies, always give wild and stray animals their space," Vaughan added. "If you see an animal in need, avoid touching it, and contact someone trained in handling animals, such as your local animal control officer or wildlife rehabilitator."

DHEC said in the release that keeping your pets up-to-date on rabies vaccination is one way to protect yourself, your family, and your pets.

Anyone who thinks they may have been exposed to rabies -- through a bite, scratch, or contact with saliva or neural tissue -- should wash the affected area with soap and water and seek medical attention.

Those exposed should also report the incident to their local DHEC Bureau of Environmental Health Services office.

According to the release, the kitten that tested positive for rabies is the 2nd animal in Spartanburg County to test positive in 2018.

"There have been 41 confirmed cases of animal rabies statewide this year," according to the release. "In 2017, 3 of the 63 confirmed rabies cases in South Carolina were in Spartanburg County."

[Rabies is a fatal disease in both people and animals.

A post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is available for people. It must be given with a few days of the bite and consists of a 1.0 mL dose of rabies vaccine given IM (in the muscle) in the deltoid (shoulder) area of adults or the anterolateral (front outside) thigh of young children on days 0, 3, 7, and 14 of the rabies PEP regimen.

Be especially careful of wild animals, but even stray domestic animals could easily be exposed to rabies. There is no treatment for rabies in animals. They are euthanized if they do not die of the disease first.

Vaccinate your pets. In most places it is required by law, but it is the best way to protect yourself and your pet. - Mod.TG
