A hospital unit for disabled people has been closed to further admissions following an outbreak of an "influenza-like" virus, and visiting restrictions have now been put in place. The contagious virus, called human metapneumovirus (hMPV), broke out at St Joseph's Disability Service, which is part of the St Ita's Psychiatric Hospital campus in Portrane, north Dublin. An HSE [Health Service Ireland] spokesperson told the Irish Independent that tests carried out last week confirmed the virus was the cause of a respiratory illness that has been affecting 11 of the residents at the unit.

A contagious virus, hMPV is spread by coughing, sneezing and contact with respiratory secretions. There is no specific treatment for this virus infection, and it cannot be prevented by vaccination. Frances Plunkett, communications officer of HSE Dublin North East, said staff at the service were dealing with the outbreak and added that "all necessary measures have been taken to minimise the risk of further spread."

[Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) was 1st identified in 2001 in Dutch children with bronchiolitis. hMPV is an RNA virus in the _Pneumovirinae_ subfamily of the family _Paramysoviridae_, and is most closely related to respiratory syncytial virus. hMPV has been shown to have worldwide circulation with nearly universal infection by age 5. Similar to influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), activity is greatest during the winter in temperate climates.

Most of the available data on the clinical manifestations of hMPV infection are from studies of children, in whom the virus causes upper respiratory tract infections, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia. As with RSV, re-infection with hMPV occurs throughout adult life, and hMPV infection has been documented in 1-9 percent of adults each year using RT-PCR and serology for diagnosis.

Illness is generally mild in young adults, with serologic evidence of asymptomatic infection in many cases. Adults at highest risk of serious sequelae as a result of hMPV include the elderly, adults with underlying pulmonary disease, and those who are immunocompromised or, as in the present outbreak, severely disabled.

Outbreaks of hMPV have been documented in long term care facilities, with mortalities of up to 50 percent in frail, elderly residents. In addition, 6-12 percent of exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease have been associated with hMPV, and underlying lung disease is common in patients hospitalized with hMPV. Lastly, hMPV has been linked with severe idiopathic pneumonia in recipients of hematopoietic stem cell transplants.

Although the true spectrum of adult hMPV remains to be defined, it is clear that hMPV can result in severe illness in the frail elderly and in adults with underlying diseases.
