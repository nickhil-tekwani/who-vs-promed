I hesitated to provide comments on the June 2 and June 16 posting regarding
the HIV figures, in particular, and other questions posed by the monitor,
Dr. Woodall, because of the request for "Russian" comments. After Dr.
Oswald's comments, let me add the following:
1. That there is a difference between Vadim Pokrovskiy's figures and that
of Sanepidnadzor, the Ministry of Health (which now subsumes the formerly
independent organization then headed by Yevgeniy Belayev), and others is no
surprise. Many other differences, some more serious in percentage as well
as absolute, can be provided especially for tuberculosis (which should be
no less than 150,000 according to many sources including WHO) and not
81,000, and for syphilis (as described to me several weeks ago in Moscow
by the head of the research unit in the Health Ministry's Central
Dermatological-Venerolgical Institute, Dr. Loseva), and so forth.
2. Even Pokrovskiy writes on occasion that the number of HIV new incidence
or alternatively, the cumulative total, is some 10 times higher than the
official (as by implication his own) statistics. Other Russian medical
sources repeat this multiplier.
3. What is the true number? Who knows? But certainly much higher than
reported.
4. Dr. Woodall's question about vaccination rates for diphtheria in
particular are a reflection of the very successful drive to have at least
90 percent coverage of all children with a DPT shot. They deserve a lot of
credit for getting the number down by some 10 times. Let me just remind
you, however, that these figures do not include Chechnya--as do most if not
all others. And Chechnya was in 1995, the source of 146 cases of polio,
with 8 for the entire remaining 88 subjects-so-called-of the remainder of
the country. Hopefully this has been reduced to a minimal number, but who
knows. I asked the head of the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences'
Institute of Poliomyelitis and Hemorrhagic Fever at lunch here at
Georgetown University about this concern of mine several months ago, and he
said he was informed by the Chechen medical authorities that there were no
cases of polio the past year. Maybe, maybe not.
5. We should be very concerned that the State Statistical Agency's Health
Statistics Health Department, in a budget cut, reduced its staff from 30
persons to 2! Can they do quality control checks, or is it left to the
Ministry of Health, and its Sanepidnadzor organization, to verify the
figures which are published the Public Health and Environment journal each
month? The rapidity of reporting is remarkable, and perhaps also a source
of some divergence in numbers at the end of the year.

[It is indeed amazing that Russia can provide statistics for the year 1997
already in January 1998, and -- as you will see if I ever get time to
reformat them for posting -- for each month of 1998 in the following month
