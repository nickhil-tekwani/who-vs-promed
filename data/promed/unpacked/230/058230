One patient tests negative for CCHF and another tests positive
--------------------------------------------------------------
A suspected Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) patient was
admitted to the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (PIMS) on
Saturday [26 Sep 2009], but after laboratory test it was confirmed
that he had not contracted the virus, Dr Waseem Khawaja, the
hospital's spokesman, told the Daily Times.

Dr Khawaja said a 65-year-old man, a resident of Haripur, was brought
to hospital on Saturday with suspected symptoms of CCHF. "He was
brought here bleeding from his eyes, nose and other parts of body.
Immediately, he was shifted to an isolation ward and samples of his
blood dispatched to the National Institute of Health (NIH). After
laboratory test, the NIH confirmed that the patient was not suffering
from CCHF," Dr Khawaja said.

He said that the PIMS administration had already placed the hospital
under emergency and established an isolation ward for treatment of
swine flu and CCHF patients. He said CCHF [was a viral hemorrhagic
fever]. Viral hemorrhagic fevers refer to a group of illnesses that
are caused by several distinct families of viruses. "In general, the
term 'viral hemorrhagic fever' is used to describe a severe
multi-system syndrome. Characteristically, overall vascular system is
damaged, and the body's ability to regulate itself is impaired in
this disease," he said. He said its symptoms often included marked
fever, fatigue, dizziness, muscle aches, loss of strength, and
exhaustion. "Patients with severe cases of VHF often show signs of
bleeding under the skin, in internal organs, or from body orifices
like the mouth, eyes, or ears. They may bleed from many sites around
the body but these patients rarely die because of blood loss," Dr
Khawaja said. He said the patients received supportive t!
herapy and there was no other treatment or established cure for VHF.
"Ribavirin, an anti-viral drug, has been effective in treating some
individuals with Lassa fever or HFRS [hemorrhagic fever with renal
syndrome], but it is very expensive and not everyone in Pakistan can
afford it," he said.

Earlier, on Friday [25 Sep 2009], a 58-year-old resident of Abottabad
was admitted to the PIMS bleeding from his nose, eyes, and other
parts of body. After laboratory test, he was confirmed as a case of
CCHF.
