Avian influenza in Denmark (in wildlife)
----------------------------------------
Information received on (and up to) 4 May 2006 from Dr Preben Willeberg,
chief veterinary officer, Danish Veterinary and Food Administration, Soborg:
End of previous report period: 12 Apr 2006 (Disease Information 2006;
19[15]: 330, 13 Apr).
Identification of agent: highly pathogenic avian influenza virus subtype H5N1.
Date of start of the event: 12 Mar 2006.
New outbreaks: There has been one reported case and death of a great
crested grebe in the town of Grasten located in the county of Southern
Jutland on 28 Apr 2006.
The protection and surveillance zones have been established in accordance
with European Union legislation (European Commission Decision 2006/115/EC).
Grasten is located within the surveillance zone established on 29 Mar 2006
in Southern Jutland. All poultry within the zones must be kept inside and
all poultry holdings -- including hobby holdings -- must be registered. The
Danish Veterinary and Food Administration will inspect all poultry holdings
in the protection zones in order to look for possible further spread of
avian influenza. Restrictions on movement of eggs and poultry have been
imposed within the zones. All hunting within the zones is also prohibited.
Several protection and surveillance zones have been lifted since the end of
March. Information about removal of zones can be accessed on the Danish
Veterinary and Food Administration's website.
The latest news about avian influenza detected in wild birds in Denmark
(including maps of the established protection and surveillance zones) can

director general for animal health and welfare, Department for Environment,
Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA), London:
Date of start of the event: 30 Mar 2006.

Avian influenza in Switzerland (in wildlife)
--------------------------------------------
Information received on 2 May 2006 (and up to 1 May) from Dr Hans Wyss,
director of the Federal Veterinary Office, Bern:
Identification of agent: highly pathogenic avian influenza virus subtype H5N1.
Date of start of the event: 26 Feb 2006.
There have been no confirmed cases for the high pathogenic avian influenza
virus subtype H5N1 reported since 24 Apr 2006.
Since the beginning of the event, a total of 9 wild birds (2 tufted ducks
[_Aythya fuligula_], one common coot [_Fulica atra_], one goosander
[_Mergus merganser_], 2 common pochards [_Aythya ferina_], one little grebe
[_Tachybaptus ruficollis_] and 2 ducks [_Anatidae_, species not
determined]) have tested positive for highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1.
[The above 9 birds have been tested positive for H5N1; 23 additional birds,
which were H5 positive but not tested for H5N1, are included in the full
list of 32 wild birds, found positive for H5/H5N1 out of 1050 dead wild
birds which have been tested in Switzerland since the beginning of February
2006. The list (in German) is available at
<http://www.bvet.admin.ch/01398/index.html?lang=de&download=04124_de.pdf>.

The zoning measures were lifted on 1 May 2006, but the national monitoring
programme for avian influenza is still in place.

[It is good news when half of the reports on wild birds in an OIE Weekly
Disease Information are entitled "No new cases". Combined with the Dutch
removal of the outdoor poultry ban based on continuing negative tests in
wild birds, and one begins to wonder about an ebb in the occurrence of wild
bird H5N1 in Europe. Even if this persists for some time, however, it might
be only a low phase of a cyclic phenomenon and when the right environmental
conditions return we may again see higher numbers of cases. - Mod.PC]
