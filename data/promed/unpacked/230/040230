On Wednesday [18 Jul 2012] animal health experts took soil samples from a pasture where cases of anthrax had been confirmed in a suckler herd. They are looking for contamination of the soil because anthrax spores can stay infectious in soil for years.

According to Edgar Kraut, spokesperson of the county, soil samples were taken at 9 locations in the 8 hectare pasture. The samples will be investigated by the reference lab for anthrax the Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut(FLI/Jena), and results are expected in about 2 weeks time.

Nevertheless, the pasture was disinfected with formalin last week and will be closed for the next 3 years.

[Recovering viable spores from pastures is truly a hit or miss activity. From experience of many misses, I can only recommend that anyone trying this should 1st walk the pasture, head down, looking for depressions, say 15 cms or so, that might mark an old cattle grave. It is easier after rain, as they act like basins and hold the rainwater. After burial, the carcasses will have decomposed, and the earth column above the carcass shifts downwards. If you are going to find any spores, this is where you should look.

The note does not state the concentration of formalin used, but I doubt whether it did any harm. It quickly decomposes and becomes a very useful, though expensive, fertiliser. The Canadians use it to disinfect around dead bison, which can have extensive and severe soil contamination around an anthrax carcass. It has the additional benefit of discouraging foxes, wolves, and bears from scavenging the carcass. But this is clearly targeted disinfection.

The Soviets found they could decontaminate a field by growing crops on it for 2 to 3 years, even fescue. This probably works by cultivation surfacing any spores to be subject to sunlight while excluding grazing livestock.

Our thanks to Sabine for finding and translating this report. - Mod.MHJ
