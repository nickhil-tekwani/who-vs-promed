Malaria claiming more British birds
-----------------------------------
Malaria is killing growing numbers of British birds including
nightingales, sparrows and chaffinches, say scientists who claim
climate change is fuelling the disease. 20 years ago few British
species showed regular signs of infection but now some 30 types are
infected, monitoring projects have found. The problem is linked to a
rapid growth in mosquito populations, which is attributed to a rise of
about 1 deg C in global average temperature.

The proportion of house sparrows infected has risen from less than 10
per cent to 30 per cent, according to Laszlo Garamszegi, of the Donana
biological station near Seville in Spain.

He carried out malaria infection analysis into more than 3000 species
around the world, comparing recent information to that dating back to
1944. The study is published in the journal Global Change Biology. He
said: "It does show trends we ought to be worried about."

The avian version of malaria cannot be passed to humans.

Ben Sheldon, professor of ornithology at Oxford University, said:
"There is very convincing evidence that a wide range of biological
processes are altering in response to climate change."

[The paper discussed above is: Garamszegi, L. (2011). Climate change
increases the risk of malaria in birds. Global Change Biology
Vol 17 (5), 1751Â­1759. (Article 1st published online: 10 Nov 2010).
Its abstract includes the following statement:

"The impact of climate change on malaria prevalence varies across
continents, with the strongest effects found for Europe and Africa.
Migration habit did not predict susceptibility to the escalating
parasite pressure by Plasmodium. Consequently, wild birds are at an
increasing risk of malaria infection due to recent climate change,
which can endanger both naive bird populations and domesticated
animals. The prevailing avian example may provide useful lessons for
understanding the effect of climate change on malaria in humans."

Several species of the filarial parasite Plasmodium are the causal
organism for avian malaria, with _Plasmodium relictum_ underlined.
According to Global Invasive Species Database (at
http://www.issg.org/database/species/ecology.asp?si=39&fr=1&sts=),
_P. relictum_ is now widespread among introduced and native birds in
Hawaii where it has played a key role in the extinction of
approximately half of the endemic bird species. _P. relictum_ has also
been reported from England, France and parts of the United States
including Maryland, Florida and New York. Recent surveys show that _P.
relictum_ is widespread and established in New Zealand, although it is
yet to be determined whether it is native or introduced.

Details on the recent observations in the UK, referred to in the above
media report, will be helpful. - Mod.AS
