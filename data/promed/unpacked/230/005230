The head of the National Center for Disease Control, Badr al-Din Najjar, said on Thursday, 12 Jul 2018, that more than 100 cases of measles have been registered after the outbreak in a number of Libyan cities. In a press statement, Najjar explained that the center recorded cases of measles in Qatron, Ubari, Ajdabya, Tripoli and Zliten, adding that they are working hard to organize a campaign against the epidemic.

Najjar said that the center is continuing with several international organizations, including the World Health Organization and UNICEF, to launch a campaign to immunize children from 6 months to 14 years, adding that UNICEF has offered 3 million anti measles vaccinations as well as vitamin A. He also said that the World Health Organization will provide logistical support to fight the disease, adding that health centres in the country do not have the vaccine against the measles epidemic, warning that it is a fatal disease in the absence of health care for those affected.

The Ministry of Health announced the start of a precautionary campaign to contain any new cases of the disease.

[Measles seems to be making a major comeback worldwide in both developed and developing countries. Under-vaccination through unavailability or anti-vaccination choices contributes to the rise of cases of this potentially fatal viral disease that can cause encephalitis or pneumonia and have bacterial superinfections as a contribution.

An excellent recent review on measles is:

Abstract
----
Measles is a highly contagious disease that results from infection with measles virus and is still responsible for more than 100â€ˆ000 deaths every year, down from more than 2 million deaths annually before the introduction and widespread use of measles vaccine. Measles virus is transmitted by the respiratory route and illness begins with fever, cough, coryza, and conjunctivitis followed by a characteristic rash. Complications of measles affect most organ systems, with pneumonia accounting for most measles-associated morbidity and mortality. The management of patients with measles includes provision of vitamin A. Measles is best prevented through vaccination, and the major reductions in measles incidence and mortality have renewed interest in regional elimination and global eradication. However, urgent efforts are needed to increase stagnating global coverage with 2 doses of measles vaccine through advocacy, education, and the strengthening of routine immunisation systems. Use of combined measles-rubella vaccines provides an opportunity to eliminate rubella and congenital rubella syndrome. Ongoing research efforts, including the development of point-of-care diagnostics and microneedle patches, will facilitate progress towards measles elimination and eradication. - Mod.LL
