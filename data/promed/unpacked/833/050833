[1] Cholera - Iraq: WHO situation report
Date: Tue 9 Oct 2007

As of 7 Oct 2007, 25 districts of Northern Iraq and 14 districts in the
south and center have reported laboratory confirmed cases of cholera.
In north Iraq: 13 out of the 14 districts of Sulaymaniyah governorate, all
5 districts of Kirkuk governorate, 6 out of the 7 districts of Erbil
governorate, one district in Dahuk.
As for the center and south, the affected districts are: 3 districts in
each of Tikrit, Mosul, and Diala, 2 districts in Basra as well as one
district in each of Wasit, Baghdad, and Anbar.
The results of the samples of _Vibrio cholerae_ isolates from Sulaymaniyah
were received from US Navy Advanced Research Unit Laboratory in Cairo.
NAMRU3 (US Naval Medical Research Unit No. 3) results confirmed
Sulaymaniyah and CPHL (Central Public Health Laboratory) results. Another
54 cholera isolates (some dating back to the 2000 outbreak) sent by the
CPHL in Baghdad were received in NAMRU3 in Cairo.
96 per cent of Iraq's cholera cases were reported from Sulaymaniyah and
Kirkuk in north Iraq, the outbreak seems to be slowly spreading to the
neighboring provinces of Erbil and Diala with 147 laboratory confirmed
cases in Erbil and 44 cases from Diala (3 laboratory confirmed and the
remaining 41 diagnosed on clinical and epidemiological grounds).
Sporadic cases with definite history of travel and food consumption in
Kirkuk were reported from Tikrit provinces; however, isolated cases with no
epidemiological link to north Iraq were also confirmed in Mosul, Wasit,
Baghdad, Anbar and Basra.
One of the important features in this outbreak is that most of the cases
seen have mild to moderate signs and symptoms. The traditional signs and
symptoms of severe dehydrating diarrhea were seen only very occasionally.
Specific control measures to contain this ongoing outbreak and limit its
spread to other areas have been reinforced by the concerned governmental
departments of the affected provinces with technical support from WHO.

A serious diarrhea outbreak has claimed the lives of 6 people in Foimahadev
VDC of remote Kalikot in the past week.
Saying that the those falling sick with diarrhea are not getting any
treatment due to lack of any medicine at the local health center, former
VDC chairman Ain Bahadur Shahi said that more than 200 others in different
wards of the village have been suffering with the disease.
