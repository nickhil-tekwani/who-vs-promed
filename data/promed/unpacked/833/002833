Vaccine shortage threatens hill farms as tick infestations rise
---------------------------------------------------------------
Sheep farmers know to their cost that their charges can be subject to a
wider range of diseases than virtually any other species of livestock,
especially during late spring and early summer. Most can now be prevented
by using vaccines or other treatments, including louping ill, a virus
condition spread by ticks on hill and upland farms, which has the potential
to cause significant losses.

More than 40 years ago the Edinburgh-based Moredun Research Institute
developed a highly effective vaccine, which was subsequently manufactured
by a several commercial companies. However, it has now emerged that
supplies of the vaccine are extremely short and many farmers will find it
difficult to source the product until autumn [2009]: this may prove to be
too late to prevent substantial losses in susceptible flocks, particularly
with tick infestations increasing.

Nigel Miller, vice-president of NFU [National Farmer's Union] Scotland, who
is also a qualified vet, said: "The increasing number of ticks found on our
hills and uplands are presenting a growing disease threat to many species
including sheep, red grouse, and humans.

"For those hill farms affected by high numbers of infected ticks, the use
of the vaccine is an important part of the health programme for their
flocks. We hope that the manufacturers will look at making fresh supplies
of the vaccine available at the earliest opportunity."

The manufacturers, Intervet-Shearing-Plough, issued a statement late
yesterday [17 Apr 2009]: "We regret that the louping ill vaccine will be
unavailable to sheep producers this spring [2009] due to unforeseen
circumstances. We have briefed the animal health trade on the situation and
equipped them with the alternative disease management information they need
to help their farming customers. In the absence of what is a unique vaccine
the only means of controlling the disease in non-immune stock is through
plunge dipping of sheep which will give around 6 weeks of control."

Professor Willie Donnachie of Moredun, said: "This could be very serious
for some farmers in vulnerable areas. The disease can also affect humans
giving them a heavy fever and problems with the nervous system."

The impact on red grouse populations also has the potential to decimate the
best moors at a very considerable financial cost. Flocks were dispersed
from many estates a decade ago, but tick infestations soon reduced the
numbers of grouse shot. In recent years some estates have re-introduced
flocks of wedders -- adult male sheep -- to act as "tick mops."

[Louping ill (ovine encephalomyelitis) is an acute, tick-transmitted viral
disease of the central nervous system (CNS) that primarily affects sheep,
but cattle, goats, horses, dogs, pigs, red deer, roe deer, red grouse, and
people also can be affected; humans can be infected by tick bites or
exposure to tissues or instruments contaminated with virus. The disease is
seen throughout the rough hill grazings of the British Isles wherever the
vector tick, _Ixodes ricinus_ , is prevalent. Diseases of sheep
indistinguishable from louping ill and caused by similar viruses have been
reported in Norway, Spain, Turkey, and Bulgaria, which suggests that the
condition may not be restricted to the British Isles.

Etiology and transmission
-------------------------
The virus belongs to the _Flaviviridae_ family, is distributed throughout
the northern temperate regions, and is part of an antigenically closely
related complex of viruses known as the tickborne encephalitides, which are
primarily associated with disease in humans. Infection is transmitted
transstadially by the tick vector; transovarial transmission does not
appear to occur. In sheep, mortality ranges from 60 per cent in newly
introduced stock to 5-10 per cent in sheep acclimatized to the pasture. On
farms where the disease is endemic, losses are mainly confined to animals
younger than 2 yr old; adults tend to be immune as a result of previous
infection, and lambs are protected in their 1st season by colostral
antibody. However, when the disease appears for the 1st time, or after a
lapse of several years, all ages of sheep are susceptible. Mortality is
variable in other species but tends to be high in red grouse. All species
of vertebrates that come in contact with questing ticks may become
parasitized and infected with louping ill virus, but only sheep and grouse
develop titers of viremia sufficient to pass the infection to the vector
tick. Infection also can be spread through contact with contaminated
instruments or tissues. Infected lactating goats can excrete high titers of
virus in their milk, which may cause fatal infection of their kids and be a
potential human health hazard.

Pathogenesis, clinical findings, and lesions
--------------------------------------------
The course of infection in all species is similar, and varies only in the
intensity of viremia and frequency with which clinical signs develop. After
inoculation by an infected tick, virus initially replicates in lymphoid
tissues, which gives rise to viremia that lasts 1-5 days. Only animals that
develop high titers can transfer the virus to ticks. During viremia, a
febrile reaction may be seen, but overt clinical signs are generally absent
until the virus enters the CNS and begins replication, even though the
immune response has eliminated the virus from the extraneuronal tissues.
The extent of neuronal damage consequent to viral replication determines
the severity of signs, from none (subclinical) through varying degrees of
neurologic dysfunction, to sudden death. Histologic lesions may be present
whether or not signs develop. Signs include fine muscular tremors, nervous
nibbling, ataxia (particularly of the hind limbs), weakness, and collapse;
death may occur 1-3 days after onset of signs. Peracute deaths may also
occur. In some recovered animals, residual paresis or torticollis may
persist. All recovered animals are solidly immune for life.

The severity of clinical disease in animals recently infected with
_Anaplasma phagocytophilum_ (the cause of tickborne fever) is markedly
increased, presumably due to the immunosuppressive effect of this organism.
The accompanying pathology may be complex and may account for the high
mortality experienced when naive flocks are introduced to tick-infested
pasture.

No specific gross lesions are present, although secondary pneumonia may
develop. Histologic examination of the CNS usually shows a nonsuppurative
polioencephalomyelitis with lesions predominantly in the brain stem.

Diagnosis
---------
The disease normally is seen only in animals that have had access to
tick-infested pasture; however, the variable clinical picture necessitates
differentiation from other conditions that cause locomotor or neurologic
dysfunction. Confirmation is by histologic examination of the brain, virus
isolation from CNS tissue, and serology. As much of the brain and brain
stem as possible should be fixed in formaldehyde solution (10 per cent in
saline), and sections examined for the characteristic lesions, which can be
useful in reaching a presumptive diagnosis. A definitive diagnosis requires
virus isolation. Brain stem (1 cubic cm) should be collected aseptically
into 50 per cent glycerol saline for isolation of the virus by mouse or
tissue-culture inoculation, and subsequent identification by fluorescent
antibody tests or neutralization with specific antibodies. Measurement of
serum neutralizing and hemagglutination inhibition antibodies also can be
useful in reaching a diagnosis and for surveys. The presence of IgM
antibody in cattle and sheep, detected by the hemagglutination inhibition
test, provides good evidence that the animal was infected within the
preceding 10 days.

Treatment and control
---------------------
No specific treatment is available, but nursing, hand feeding, and sedation
may be helpful. An inactivated, tissue-culture-propagated vaccine is
available and has successfully protected sheep, cattle, and goats. A single
injection induces an antibody response that provides protection for more
than 2 years. Colostrum from the vaccinated ewe prevents infection of lambs
in their 1st months. Generally, all animals to be retained for breeding are
vaccinated at 6-12 months of age. Use of insecticidal dips to protect
against exposure to ticks generally is inadequate, although pour-on
preparations reduce exposure and their systematic use may be effective in
reducing the abundance of ticks.

Zoonotic risk
-------------
Louping ill virus infection of humans can cause severe encephalomyelitis.
Symptoms are biphasic; the initial flu like symptoms are replaced 4-5 days
later with signs of encephalitis. People become infected through the bite
of infected ticks or through contact with infected carcasses, sharp
instruments, or aerosol. Only a few cases of natural transmission have been
reported, most occurring in laboratory workers. Those engaged in the
diagnosis or research of this virus should be vaccinated with a human
vaccine against tickborne encephalitis virus. As goats can excrete high
titers of virus in their milk, goats kept for milk production in endemic
areas must be vaccinated.
