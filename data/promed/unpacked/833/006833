A horse in Keysville, GA has been diagnosed with eastern equine
encephalitis, according to the Department of Agriculture in Tifton,
GA. The horse was euthanized by a veterinarian because of its signs
and the high fatality rate among horses associated with the disease,
according to a news release.

The virus causes inflammation in a horse's brain. The Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention considers it one of the most serious
mosquito-borne diseases in the U.S. It cannot be spread from horses
to humans [But mosquitoes can transmit the disease to humans. - Mod.TG].

Fred Koehle, the operations manager for the Richmond County Health
Department's Mosquito Control Division, said horse owners in southern
Richmond County need to take precautions because the species of
mosquito that carries the virus has a range of 8 to 10 miles.

There have been no cases of eastern equine encephalitis in humans
since 2006, but humans are at a higher risk because of a recent
elevated number of cases in south Georgia and north Florida, the
release states.

[Florida has issued many warnings about the disease being present.
While the mosquitoes' natural range may be 8-10 miles, they can be
blown off course by weather and cover larger areas. Other mosquitoes
may be infected and take the disease into Georgia.

There is a vaccine for protection for horses. Owners are strongly
encouraged to use it on an annual basis to help protect their
animals. - Mod.TG]
