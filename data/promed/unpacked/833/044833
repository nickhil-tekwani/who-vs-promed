visceral leishmaniasis caused by _Leishmania (Leishmania) mexicana_ in
an immunocompromised patient: a case report; Transfusion (Mar 10;

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Background
----------
Transfusion-transmitted leishmaniasis is an increasing problem in
areas where visceral and cutaneous leishmaniases are endemic.
Case report
-----------
This article reports a case of transfusion-transmitted fatal visceral
leishmaniasis (VL) caused by _Leishmania (Leishmania) mexicana_ in a
42-year-old male resident of northwestern Colombia who after
developing a terminal renal failure due to lupus nephritis received a
renal transplant and multiple [blood] transfusions.
Results
-------
Multiple intracellular _Leishmania_ amastigotes were demonstrated in
both renal biopsy and marrow aspirates. Cultures of the parasite were
obtained in NNN medium and the identification of the species was done
both by direct immunofluorescence and polymerase chain
reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism.
Conclusions
-----------
This is the 1st report of a VL case produced by _L. (L.) mexicana_ in
Colombia, which usually is a dermotropic species. Our report suggests
that although leishmaniasis is transmitted by the bite of phlebotomine
sandflies, _Leishmania_ parasite may be transmitted by blood
transfusion, complicating the clinical course of organ transplant and
being fatal.

[The potential risk of transmitting visceral leishmaniasis, VL, by
blood transfusion is rarely reported.
A case from Greece, where a patient died from VL after receiving 2
blood transfusions one of which had high titers against leishmania has
been reported (Mpaka MA et al: Septic shock due to visceral
leishmaniasis, probably transmitted from blood transfusion. J Infect
Dev Ctries. 2009; 3(6): 479-83, available at
<http://www.jidc.org/index.php/journal/article/view/19762964/252>). VL
is endemic in southern Europe and north Africa and a serosurvey from
Sicily found that 0.75 percent of blood donors were antibody positive
and 0.25 percent were PCR positive (Scarlata F et al. Asymptomatic
_Leishmania infantum/chagasi_ infection in blood donors of western
Sicily. Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg. 2008;102(4): 394-6; abstract
available at
<http://www.tropicalmedandhygienejrnl.net/article/S0035-9203(08)00013-8/abstract>).
The fact that transfusion related VL is rarely reported probably
means that recipients of infected blood products usually are not
infected. The situation may be different in immunosuppressed patients
as illustrated in the case reported in Transfusion. - Mod.EP]
