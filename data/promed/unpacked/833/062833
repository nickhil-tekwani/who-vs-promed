UNIDENTIFIED FATAL ILLNESS - ECUADOR (02)
=========================================
Date: Sat, 24 May 1997 09:23:52 -0700

[see
Unidentified fatal illness - Ecuador 970523161941]
I ran this case through the GIDEON sofware, and came up with no fewer than 52
compatible infectious diseases. Additional clinical, contact and laboratory
data would help narrow this down a bit. The number one diagnosis listed is
shigellosis [what's common is common]. Shigellosis is noted to account for
23% of diarrhea in this country in the age group < 2 years, and may explain
the neurological findings (seizures are more typical) and age-specific
mortality. Indeed, the case-fatality rates for most forms of infectious
diarrhea are higher among young children. Thus, other possibilities include
campylobacteriosis, salmonellosis, etc.
GIDEON also lists leptospirosis (ranked 7th). This is reminiscent of the
water-borne Nicaraguan outbreak of 1995, in which pulmonary disease
predominated. Other potentially water-associated (e.g., ingestion- or
mosquito-related) diseases which may produce diarrhea include malaria,
Venezuelan equine encephalitis, dengue (5,189 cases reported in Ecuador
during 1996), amoebiasis and balantidiasis.

[Thanks once again to Steve Berger for helping to narrow the possibilities.
Rotaviruses also should be considered. When a definitive diagnosis has been
made we would appreciate hearing what it was. -- Mod CHC]
