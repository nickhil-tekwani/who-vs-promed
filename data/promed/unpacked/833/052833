Further tests are to be carried out on more than 40 people following an _E. coli_ [O157] outbreak linked to a Belfast restaurant. The management of Flicks restaurant at Cityside Mall on York Street voluntarily closed the premises and are cooperating with the investigation. 11 confirmed or suspected cases have already been identified. It has now emerged that there was a separate _E. coli_ outbreak at the same restaurant in August 2012.

Dr Michael Devine from the Public Health Agency said 42 people had contacted their GP with symptoms. He said they require further investigation to find out what they had been eating in order to pinpoint the source of the infection. "In response to the public information put out on Sat 13 Oct 2012, and yesterday [14 Oct 2012] we have identified a further 42 people who require further investigation," he said. "At this stage I should stress they don't have positive laboratory results but obviously we will be following that up today (15 Oct 2012)."

At the weekend [13-14 Oct 2012], the Public Health Agency urged anyone who ate at the restaurant since 24 Sep 2012 and had symptoms of diarrhoea and/or abdominal pain to contact their GP urgently. He said the 1st case was discovered on 9 Oct 2012 and the 2nd report was on 11 Oct 2012 when the restaurant closed voluntarily. Environmental health officers from Belfast City Council are also taking part in the investigation.

"At this point, what we're trying to do is encourage people if they have eaten at Flicks restaurant, particularly on or around 4 Oct 2012, and they've got symptoms of diarrhea, particularly bloody diarrhea, or abdominal pains, that they would get medical advice from their GP."

Dr Devine said 4 of the 11 people known to have been infected had been in hospital, but he understood all had since been discharged. He said some people could have been infected but not be experiencing any symptoms. "With _E. coli_ 0157, it can be a very serious infection and that's why we're raising this alert, but some people can have very minimal or even no symptoms," he said. "So if people have eaten at the restaurant and they've got concerns, I would advise they get medical advice."

In August 2012, 4 people who had eaten at Flicks restaurant were found to have _E. coli_ 0157.
