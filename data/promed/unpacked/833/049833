The detection of an outbreak of chicken pox forced the Medical Director of the Children's Hospital Jose Manuel de los Rios to restrict the admission of patients to the health center. A statement released yesterday [22 Jun 2015] by the hospital authorities informed medical personnel that at least 15 children were exposed to an extremely contagious viral infection.

"They recommend [restricting admissions to] the institution only for serious emergency cases, who will be located in areas selected for the care of unexposed and immune patients," said the statement signed by the medical director Juan Felix Garcia.

A source, who asked that we not reveal his identity, said that even emergencies were severely restricted. In that area, there are 2 patients diagnosed with chickenpox: a girl with a blood cancer who is on artificial ventilation, and other children with HIV and chronic malnutrition who are a source of infection for other children.

"The Infectious Diseases and Medical Services are trying to follow up on cases, but the whole hospital is exposed. For the past 6-8 months, there have been isolated cases in the health center; even some medical students have been infected, but [the current outbreak] is the most serious," he said.

Huniades Urbina, president of the Venezuelan Society of Childcare and Pediatrics, warned that there has been no chickenpox vaccine in the country since May 2014. The flaw, he explained, is global: "There are problems with the European and Asian strains that are used to make the vaccine. However, it must be noted that the Ministry of Health does not include the vaccine in their immunization schedule, so it would be available only at private schools, but there is no official information from the ministry about the deficit," he said.

Urbina said 2 doses of vaccine are needed to immunize patients against the disease. "Patients are at risk," he said.

[Chickenpox (also known as varicella), though usually a mild, self-limited disease in healthy children, can be serious, especially in babies, adults, and people with weakened immune systems. The disease is characterized by a skin rash that forms small, itchy blisters. Complications of chickenpox include pneumonia, encephalitis and secondary bacterial infections. Chickenpox is highly contagious; it spreads in the air through coughing or sneezing from an infected person to others who never had chickenpox or received the chickenpox vaccine.

Exposure to airflow from rooms housing patients with varicella is a major risk factor for the acquisition of infection among susceptible hosts (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6289235). It can also be spread by touching or breathing in the virus particles that come from chickenpox blisters or herpes zoster, which is also caused by the chickenpox virus. Chickenpox is contagious from 1-2 days before the rash forms and continues until all the lesions are crusted over (usually about 5 days). Chickenpox can be prevented by vaccination with the live-attenuated varicella vaccine. Because about 15-20 percent of people who have received one dose of chickenpox vaccine still do get chickenpox if exposed, the chickenpox vaccine is given twice, initially at ages 12-18 months and again at ages 4-6 years. Unimmunized older children and adults should also be vaccinated twice, with 4-8 weeks between the 1st and 2nd vaccinations. A combination vaccine, which contains both chickenpox and MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccines, may be given instead of the 2 individual vaccines. Many countries have universal childhood chickenpox vaccination. In the U.S., the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) issued a recommendation in 2006 for 2 doses of varicella vaccine to be given universally to children.

Nosocomial transmission of the chickenpox virus (VZV) is well-recognized problem
(http://www.cdc.gov/chickenpox/hcp/healthcare-setting.html), and it is tragic what is happening in Venezuela. Because varicella is highly contagious and may cause serious disease in hospitalized patients, prevention of chickenpox among health care personnel, isolation of patients with chickenpox, and the management of those exposed to chickenpox in the healthcare setting are essential. Recommended control measures include strict isolation, cohorting, or discharge of infected patients where possible and isolation and cohorting or discharge of exposed susceptibles. Patients, health care providers, and visitors with chickenpox or herpes zoster can spread the infection to susceptible patients and health care providers in healthcare settings. Healthcare personnel caring for patients with chickenpox or zoster should be immune to varicella. Susceptible hospital personnel with significant exposure should not have direct patient contact from the 10th through the 21st day after exposure, if they do not develop varicella.

Airborne precautions (negative airflow rooms) until lesions are dry and crusted are required. If negative airflow rooms are not available, patients with varicella should be isolated in closed rooms with no contact with persons without evidence of immunity. Varicella-Zoster Immune Globulin (VZIG) is used for passive immunization of 1) susceptible, immunocompromised patients after significant exposure to chickenpox or zoster, 2) newborns of mothers who develop chickenpox within 5 days before and 48 hours after delivery, and 3) adults who are believed susceptible and who have had significant exposure (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00022690.htm). If VZIG is not available, antiviral drugs (acyclovir, famciclovir, or valacyclovir) may prevent chickenpox or lessen disease severity (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9427463).

People without evidence of immunity to varicella and who do not have a contraindication to vaccination should be vaccinated. Post-exposure vaccination should be given as soon as possible after exposure, optimally within 3-5 days of exposure, but vaccination is still indicated more than 5 days after exposure because it induces protection against subsequent exposures. People without evidence of immunity who have contraindications to vaccination (e.g., immunocompromised persons) should be excluded from an outbreak setting through 21 days after rash onset of the last identified patient. Further details of infection control for a nosocomial chickenpox outbreak can be found at http://www.cdc.gov/chickenpox/outbreaks/manual.html.

Children's Hospital Jose Manuel de los Rios is a pediatric public health center located in the Capital District, west of Caracas in north central Venezuela (https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital_de_Ni√±os_J._M._de_los_R%C3%ADos). The Capital District of Venezuela is a federal district, with a population of about 2 million people, which contains about half of the city of Caracas (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_District_(Venezuela)).
