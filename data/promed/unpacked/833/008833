_Mycoplasma_ infections are becoming more drug resistant, doctors say, adding that there could be a major outbreak this year. _Mycoplasma_ can spread through contact with the saliva or mucus of an infected person, with the typical age of onset being 5 to 15 years. Infections are more prevalent during the transition period from spring to summer or in the fall, and common symptoms include respiratory tract infection, pneumonia and persistent coughing with phlegm.

Former minister of health and welfare Lin Tzou-yien, chairman of the National Health Research Institutes' board of directors, on [Sun 29 Sep 2019] said that symptoms of pneumonia caused by _Mycoplasma_ infections tended to be mild. However, this year [2019], several cases have led to pleural effusion and proved to be resistant to treatment by the antibiotic erythromycin, he said.

Previously, only about 14% of cases were drug resistant, but the percentage has risen to 70%, he added. A doctor specializing in infectious disease confirmed that 2 types of _Mycoplasma_ bacteria with erythromycin resistance have been spreading this year [2019], Lin said.

Erythromycin-resistant _Mycoplasma_ has also been detected outside of Taiwan, he said. The percentage of _Mycoplasma_ infections in Japan with erythromycin resistance had risen to more than 80% from about 5% in the past, he said, adding that the situation only improved after patients were given a different antibiotic. In South Korea, the figure is about 80% and up to 90% of _Mycoplasma_ infections in China are drug-resistant, he said.

Taipei's Cathay General Hospital has reported that a case of _Mycoplasma_ infection in a 5-year-old girl led to high fever, a severe cough and pleural effusion. Even with hospital admission and antibiotic treatment, she did not fully recover until 3 weeks later, the hospital said.

_Mycoplasma_ drug resistance has been a problem for many years, an infectious disease specialist said. A large outbreak of _Mycoplasma_ infection occurs about once every 3 to 5 years, the specialist said, adding that an outbreak could occur this year [2019]. The specialist estimated that medical centers might be seeing at least twice as many patients with _Mycoplasma_ infections this year [2019] compared with last year [2018].

While most _Mycoplasma_ infections typically resolve with treatment, a small number of infections could lead to serious complications, Centers for Disease Control (CDC) Deputy Director-General Philip Lo said.

A major reason bacteria develop resistance to drugs is because of the overuse of oral antibiotics. The CDC is closely following the trend of _Mycoplasma_ drug resistance, and would discuss a strategy with pediatric infectious disease experts to raise awareness about the importance of using antibiotics reasonably and to work with the National Health Insurance Administration to control antibiotic abuse, he said.

Children with a cough and fever that does not go away should be taken to a hospital as soon as possible to avoid a delay in treatment, Lin said. Doctors, on the other hand, should be wary of overprescribing erythromycin, especially for coughs or asthma, he said. If erythromycin fails to improve symptoms of _Mycoplasma_ infections within 3 days, doctors should consider prescribing a different antibiotic, he added.

[_Mycoplasma pneumoniae_ commonly cause a mild acute upper respiratory infection with fever, nonproductive cough, pharyngitis, malaise, muscle pains, earache, and headache in children and young adults (http://www.cdc.gov/pneumonia/atypical/mycoplasma/index.html). Radiologically confirmed pneumonia develops in 5-10% of cases. _M. pneumoniae_ accounts for 15-20% of community-acquired lower respiratory infection in adults that require hospitalization and probably an even greater proportion of those that do not require hospitalization. Approximately 20% of infections are asymptomatic. Extrapulmonary syndromes, including cardiologic (e.g., pericarditis, myocarditis, arrhythmias), neurologic (e.g., encephalitis), hematologic (hemolysis), and dermatologic findings (erythema multiforme) may occur rarely. Cold agglutinins may be present in the acute serum of 30-60% of patients.

Macrolides, tetracyclines (doxycycline), fluoroquinolones have been the antimicrobials of choice for _M. pneumoniae_ infections (https://www.cdc.gov/pneumonia/atypical/mycoplasma/hcp/antibiotic-treatment-resistance.html). However, macrolide resistance has been reported worldwide, especially in Asia, where resistance rates of over 90% have been reported (China), whereas in Europe and North America resistance rates of up to 25% have been documented (https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2015.20.48.30078). Macrolide-resistant strains of _M. pneumoniae_ have not been documented to show cross-resistance to other classes of antibiotics, i.e., tetracyclines and fluoroquinolones (https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2016.00974/full). A real-time PCR assay has been developed to detect in clinical specimens the mutations that confer macrolide resistance in _M. pneumoniae_ (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2565909/). - Mod.ML
