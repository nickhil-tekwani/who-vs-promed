USDA has undertaken an extensive study using genetic fingerprinting to map
the microbial environment of the US poultry industry. Directed by Norman
Stern, Ph.D., chief research microbiologist at USDA's Poultry
Microbiological Safety Research Unit, the study will focus on organisms
especially troubling to US poultry producers. The study will involve five of
the top US producers and draw samples from leading poultry-producing states,
Arkansas, California, Mississippi, Delaware, Maryland and Virginia. It will
compare several methods of genetic fingerprinting.
Samples will be taken from every step of the raising, fabricating and
processing of poultry, including hatcheries and feed bins and even the soles
of the farmers' boots. All the collected samples will be cultured and
fingerprinted genetically. One of the genetic fingerprinting methods being
evaluated is the Riboprinter TM Microbial Characterization System, from
Quaicon, Wilmington, DE.
The system is a tabletop instrument that compares the DNA fingerprint of any
sample to an existing database, and stores the pattern along with reference
to its origin. By matching these characteristic fingerprints throughout the
production process, researchers hope to be able to track the source of
problematic organisms, in particular Salmonella and Campylobacter.
>From this comprehensive collection of genetic fingerprints, researchers at
the Agricultural Research Service in Athens, CA, will build a national
database of where, and in turn, how, poultry can be contaminated. Led by
Stan Bailey, Ph.D., USDA's team of six to eight researchers expect to handle
10,000 samples, of which as many as 5,000 will be fingerprinted. Bailey says
smaller studies of this sort have been done in the past, but they have
usually only focused on a single farm or hatchery. The new study may take
two years, he says, adding that, "Industry participation has been great."
The RiboPrinter is based on a method of strain typing called ribotyping,
which begins by lysing the cells and cutting the released DNA into fragments
by use of a restriction enzyme. Gel electrophoresis separates the fragments
by molecular weight. Next the fragments are hybridized with a DNA probe and
a chemiluminescent agent is added. The system's digital camera makes images
of the fragments that are then processed through a series of proprietary
algorithms, adjusted against markers of known molecular weights, and stored
as Riboprint patterns. The time to result for most types of bacteria is
eight hours.
Patterns are then compared to others in the database for
characterization-grouping below the species level-and identification. The
results are automatically printed out and stored in the database for future
reference. When the same bacteria is found again, the system will
distinguish the patterns. In this way, investigators will be able to map
routes of contamination. The information can also be used by producers to
target decontamination and build an effective HACCP (Hazard Analysis
Critical Control Points) compliance system.
Up until now, the use of genetic fingerprints to map the microbial
environment of an entire industry's production has not been feasible because
of the technique's complexity. Manual methods of genetic characterization
require the skills of a microbiologist with an advanced degree and can take
weeks to perform. The Riboprinter system can do the job more easily and
rapidly. Bailey says he is confident that the new study will be able to
gather the kind of information that is needed to determine the sources of
pathogens in poultry on a national level.
