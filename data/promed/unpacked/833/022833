[Much confused & confusing information is coming out in the Malaysian press
about the current situation in relation to the 1997 outbreak. We have
extracted below what we believe is the wheat from the chaff - Mod.JW
Sarawak Medical Department director Dr. Yao Sik Chi today confirmed that
the Atlanta-based Centre for Disease Control and Prevention study indicated
that the 1997 outbreak of Hand, Foot and Mouth (HFM) disease in Sarawak was
"most probably" caused by Enterovirus 71 and Adenovirus. He said the "most
probably" conclusion was arrived at as "very few post mortems had been done
on the cases". "Scientifically, we cannot be 100 per cent certain about the
virus as we don't have adequate and sufficient evidence" he told
Malaysiakini.
Yao said that normally the HFM disease is caused by Coxsackie A 16,
enterovirus 71 and echovirus. However, Yao also clarified that 9 children
had died in Miri since January 2000, 7 were attributed to "normal" causes
and only 2 showed a similar pattern to the outbreak 2 years ago where the
children succumbed to heart failure. He stressed that the Health Ministry
does not know the actual cause of the deaths of the two children as they
need to wait for the Universiti Sarawak Malaysia to culture the virus. "It
takes about two to three months to identify the virus," Yao said.
A virologist from Sarawak today stated that ... [She agreed with Health
Ministry director-general Dr. Abu Bakar Suleiman's prognosis that a certain
virus is causing the illness, and that while "researchers have known quite
a lot about the virus, this is still not the right time to reveal it". [!!!
- Mod.JW .
The virologist, who is well known internationally but requested to remain
anonymous, told Malaysiakini that the authorities had [identified the
particular strain of the enterovirus that had caused the HFM disease this
year. "HFM disease is a common disease of childhood and happens in most
years... in 1998 there was a small outbreak, but with only 65 cases in the
whole of last year [1999, it was negligible. So this year there had been a
lot of susceptible children who had not the opportunity to get exposed in
1998 and 1999, indicating the level of immunity in the children is low this
year," she said [and therefore an outbreak was to be expected - Mod.JW.
In mid-1997, an outbreak blamed on the Coxsackie virus took the lives of 31
children under 5 years old, with 911 treated at hospitals and clinics. She
said that the 1997 outbreak was most probably caused by Enterovirus 71 and
Adenovirus, but there were many other viruses circulating at the same time,
like Coxsackie A16, Japanese encephalitis and dengue.
She stated that the government has been monitoring the situation in Sarawak
since 1997. "If nobody is monitoring the situation and studying HFM
disease, then you won't know that there is a rise in these cases. So the
idea that this is happening only in Sarawak is probably erroneous," she
added.
