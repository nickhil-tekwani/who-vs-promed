There are growing concerns tonight over e-cigarettes. That's because calls into the poison control hotline have spiked from people, especially kids, ingesting the chemicals.

E-cigarette makers say their product is safer than tobacco, however the number of accidents with the e-cigarette refill is growing here in Hawaii and nationwide.

Cotton candy, apple candy, Skittles -- e-cigarettes come in all sorts of tastes.

"The flavors are enticing to kids," said Rex Benigno, 808 Smokes owner. They smell sweet too, but kids may not realize it can make them sick or worse. Depending on the concentration and the size of the person it could only take about a tablespoon of the liquid to be fatal.

"That's the concern. That's the worry. So far we've been very lucky," said Dr. Al Bronstein, Hawaii Poison Hotline.

Dr. Al Bronstein with the Hawaii Poison Hotline says the numbers are dramatic. In 2011 and prior there weren't any e-cigarette poisoning cases in Hawaii. In 2012 there were 9 cases, 8 of which were kids under 6 years old. In 2013 there were 22 cases, 17 of which were kids. And there have been 6 already this year, 4 were kids.

"Just have proper respect for these solutions. They can come in small bottles, big bottles, we need to keep them away from children," said Dr. Bronstein.

It's not just drinking the "juice," but simply getting it on your skin can make people sick.

"It's my personal opinion they should be regulated. We need to know what's exactly in the solutions. The packaging needs to be appropriate. I think that would really benefit everyone," said Dr. Bronstein.

We checked in with e-cig makers in Hawaii. Some like 808-Smokes already use child resistant caps.

"For safety, we don't want to poison the kids with the nicotine," said Benigno.

He says parents need to be responsible as well. "Keep it out of reach. Keep it in your cupboards. Don't just leave it laying around where kids can get access to it. That's kind of careless," said Benigno.

While flavors are attractive to kids, they need to be kept out of their hands.

There was a case on the mainland of someone committing suicide by injecting himself with the e-cigarette juice. There haven't been any other deaths, although many have had to go to the emergency room.

[E-cigarettes are electronic cigarettes. The 1st ones came from the Ruyan company in 2004. According to media reports, Ruyan says it sold 300 000 e-cigarettes in 2008.

The e-cigarette comes in many shapes and sizes. And according to this article, there are even flavors other than nicotine now. Many look more or less like long cigarettes; others look like cigars or pipes. They all work the same basic way:
- The user inhales through a mouthpiece.
- Air flow triggers a sensor that switches on a small, battery-powered heater.
- The heater vaporizes liquid nicotine in a small cartridge (it also activates a light at the "lit" end of the e-cigarette). They do not contain tobacco, but they do contain nicotine. Users can opt for a cartridge without nicotine. In addition to the nicotine-free option, There are flavor options.
- The heater also vaporizes propylene glycol (PEG) in the cartridge. PEG is the stuff of which theatrical smoke is made.
- The user gets a puff of hot gas that feels a lot like tobacco smoke.
- When the user exhales, there's a cloud of PEG vapor that looks like smoke. The vapor quickly dissipates.
- E-cigarettes contain no tobacco products; even the nicotine is synthetic.

E-cigarettes comprise less than 2 percent of all tobacco-related sales (data from 2010); they now account for more than 40 percent of poison center calls. More than half of the calls involved children younger than 5 years old, according to the CDC.

"Nicotine is probably the most toxic plant chemical ever discovered," said Dr. Richard Clark, medical director for the California Poison Control System and a professor of toxicology. Clark said poison centers like his are seeing a steady increase in calls related to e-cigarettes. Of particular concern, he said, is that unlike the conventional cigarette, which is usually very bitter, these devices are flavored and thus more attractive to children. The solution is also easily absorbed through the skin if spilled, unlike the contents of regular cigarettes.

It is unclear what the actual poison is? Is it the nicotine? The flavoring? The PEG? Or the heat? Some might even say it is a combination of these things.

If the liquid in these electronic cigarettes can burn the skin, then it must be something in the liquid. What is that "something," and is it more than PEG?

Also, this article does not provide any insights into what the clinical signs of this poisoning are. That would be very helpful to understand what is happening with the children.
