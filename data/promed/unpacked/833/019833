_Xylella fastidiosa_ has infected at least one million almond trees in Majorca. Scientist Eduardo Moralejo, who already warned in 2010 of the presence of the bacterium, now confirms that [it] is behind the crop's high mortality, which was initially attributed to the wood-decay fungus [see ProMED-mail post 20091022.3630]. Around 150 000 trees have been killed by the bacterium over the last decade, while another 800 000 have been infected. This entails that at least 950 000 almond trees have been hit by the disease, 70 per cent of the island's total.

Moralejo has been collaborating with the Laboratory of Plant Health of the Government. The main conclusion is that the wood-decay fungus that had been identified as causing the death of almond trees is actually an "advanced stage" of the almond leaf scorch disease (ALSD) caused by _Xylella_. The _Xylella_ detected coincides genetically with California's strain, which causes the Pierce's disease [in] vineyards. This [2017] summer, the surge in the number of almond trees with symptoms was perfectly clear.

[_Xylella fastidiosa_ (Xf) clogs the xylem of plants leading to wilting, necrosis, and often death. It causes many serious crop diseases such as Pierce's disease of grapevine; leaf scorch of coffee, almond, and olive; peach phony disease; plum leaf scald; citrus variegated chlorosis; lucerne dwarf; leaf scorch of a range of other woody species. Latent infections of wild species as potential pathogen reservoirs have also been reported. While all strains of _Xylella_ have been classified into a single species, several subspecies have been proposed and more research is needed to determine their host range and risks to crops.

Xf is spread by xylem-feeding insects, but also by grafting and with infected plant material. It is not seed borne. Moist conditions favour the vectors and therefore Xf-associated diseases. Disease management is difficult due to the large numbers of hosts and vectors and may include use of clean planting and grafting material, as well as vector control. Both the bacterium and its main vectors are of serious quarantine concern.

Xf had previously been reported mainly from the Americas. In 2013, it was reported in olives from Italy (ProMED-mail posts 20131101.2033095, 20140820.2708739, and 20140424.2425497). That outbreak was thought to likely represent the first appearance of Xf in the European region due to contaminated imports of plant material.

However, the detection of multiple subspecies in a diversity of hosts, including some asymptomatic ornamentals acting as reservoir host, subsequently suggested that some Xf strains had to have been present in the region for a considerable amount of time, in order to be able to affect a multitude of local hosts. The research reported above now provides additional support for such a scenario.

Xf is currently considered the most serious phytosanitary threat to European grape and fruit production. Research on pathogen distribution, strains, host range, and potential vectors in the region has been given high priority. The pathogen has been added to the A1 quarantine list of the European Plant Protection Organisation (EPPO).

For Spain, the Balearic Islands were the site for the 1st reports of Xf in the country, on cherry (ProMED-mail post 20161125.4653479), as well as for the grapevine strain (ProMED-mail post 20161208.4685744). The story above is a sad example of how lack of diligence in "diagnosing" an unknown plant disease can result in disastrous crop losses. It is not clear from this story how the original misdiagnosis of 'wood decay fungus' was arrived at, but it appears that molecular diagnosis, although well established for Xf at the time, was not applied. Most likely, early correct identification of Xf as the cause of the almond dieback in the Balearics would have enabled early eradication responses and saved many of the almond orchards. Since 'mystery' fungi on almonds were also reported from mainland Spain in 2011 (ProMED-mail post 20110907.2728), it appears advisable to investigate if those problems were also due to Xf.
