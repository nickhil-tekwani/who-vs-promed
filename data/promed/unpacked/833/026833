One human, 2 wild animals and one domestic animal in Mesa County along with a domestic animal in Moffat County have tested positive for tularemia.

Also called rabbit fever, "Tularemia is a fatal bacterial disease of rabbits and rodents that can spread to humans and other species," states the Colorado Parks and Wildlife fact sheet on tularemia.

More than 100 human cases of the disease were reported between January 2005 and August 2016 in Colorado. Of those, 16 cases occurred on the Western Slope in Delta (2), Eagle (2), Garfield (2), Grand (1), Gunnison (1), Mesa (5), Montrose (2) and Routt (1) counties, said the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment Tularemia Surveillance Report.

"Although tularemia can be life-threatening, most infections can be treated successfully with antibiotics," the CDC said. The majority of animals testing positive for the disease in Colorado were rabbits; however, other animals with the disease include: beavers, Colorado chipmunks, hamsters, mice, muskrats, prairie dogs, tree squirrels, coyote and fox, said the health department report.

"It's called rabbit fever but affects a wide variety of animals," said Mike Porras, CPW regional public information officer based in Grand Junction.
