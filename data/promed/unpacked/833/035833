The villagers from Azmatabad area of Thannamandi Sub Division held a protest today [18 Apr 2021], as about 47 sheep have died due to some mysterious disease in the area.

Sources said that the villagers alleged that during the last 2 weeks, about 47 sheep of [about 5] villagers died due to a "mysterious" disease. Today, [18 Apr 2021] 3 sheep of [another] owner also died due to an unknown disease.

They alleged that [their representative] made a request to the concerned officials of the Sheep Husbandry department at Thannamandi to provide vaccine to control this epidemic, but nobody except a nursing orderly of the department visited the area.

[Azmatabad is a village in Thanamandi tehsil in Rajouri district of the Indian union territory of Jammu and Kashmir. It is about 20 km east of India's border with Pakistan's territories (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azmatabad,_Jammu_and_Kashmir).

The request for vaccination may be suggestive of a suspicion among the sheep owners that an infectious disease is involved against which a vaccine is available. One such infectious disease known to circulating in the region is peste des petits ruminants (PPR). However, in the absence of details, including the denominator (number of susceptible sheep) for the 47 reported deaths, their age(s), clinical signs, etc., a list of possible candidate health threats, infectious or otherwise, cannot be suggested.

Any additional information, in particular results of a veterinary investigation, which should be applied, will be helpful. - Mod.AS
