KCDC issues cholera alert
---------------------------
Health authorities are on high alert for a possible outbreak of
cholera this summer [2004], advising people to take special care to
avoid contracting the contagious disease.
7 people from Southeast Asian countries, such as Indonesia, Thailand,
and the Philippines, have been infected with the disease in 2004.
There have also been 6 cases in which the cholera bacillus was
detected in airplane sewage.
In 2003, only one traveler was infected with the disease, and there
were no cases in which the bacterium was detected in aircraft,
according to the Korea Center for Disease Control and Prevention
(KCDC). The KCDC yesterday, Sun 25 Jul 2004, issued a cholera
advisory, pointing out that warming sea water would raise the
possibility of cholera outbreaks. It said that cholera bacteria was
found in fish and in crabs in some rivers.
Some KCDC officials are concerned about a massive outbreak of the
disease this summer [2004] on an unverified theory that cholera tends
to be prevalent every 10 years. 9 years have passed since 1995, when
68 cholera patients were reported. The health authorities advised
people to drink boiled water, eat well-cooked food, and wash their
hands before having meals to prevent getting cholera. It also urged
travelers to Southeast Asian countries to take precautions against
contracting the disease.

[The warning related to enteric pathogens is reflected already in an
upswing of food poisoning in individuals in South Korea (from our
posting Cholera, diarrhea & dysentery update 2004 (16) 20040710.1847):
The number of food poisoning patients surged to a record monthly high
of 2678 in May 2004, the Korea Food and Drug Administration (KFDA)
reported on Fri 2 Jul 2004. The health authorities are taking
measures to prevent a massive outbreak of food poisoning ahead of the
hot summer 2004 season.
According to the KFDA, the previous monthly record was in March 2003
with 2525 patients, followed by 2257 in May 2001, 1938 in June 2001,
and 1916 in May 2003.
Some 2336 people were found to have contracted the disease in June
2004. However, the number is likely to rise, as inspections on 23
suspected cases are currently under way, an administration official
said.
A total of 88 food poisoning outbreaks occurred, creating 6074
patients in the first half of 2004. The number is almost the same as
6242 patients, from 79 outbreaks, during the same period of 2003.
ProMED hopes that, by posting this alert prior to the regular cholera
updates, the number of cases may be decreased. - Mod.LL]
