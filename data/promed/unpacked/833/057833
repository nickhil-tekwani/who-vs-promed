Doctor dies of Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever after contracting the virus from patient
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A local hospital is on alert as a resident doctor died of the dreaded Crimean-Congo Haemorrhagic Fever (CCHF) in Ahmedabad today [Fri 22 Jun 2012]. A doctor at the V S Hospital, who contracted the virus while treating a patient with an unknown haemorrhagic viral fever, today died at a private hospital.

"We started screening all ward boys, nursing staff and resident doctors as soon as we received the positive report of the doctor's blood sample from the National Institute of Virology, Pune," said Dr Pankaj Patel, the superintendent of the Municipal Corporation-run V S Hospital. "On Wednesday [20 Jun 2012], while the doctor was treating a patient, a splash of patient's blood landed on his face. Next day he complained of high-grade fever, severe headache, and metallic taste in his mouth. He was immediately rushed here. But today he passed away," said Dr Atul Patel, senior consultant at Sterling Hospital, where the deceased doctor was undergoing treatment.

Authorities at the V S Hospital have started checking everybody who was in the medical team with the deceased doctor and given preventive medicines, as were also his colleagues who took him to the private hospital and had stayed with him until he passed away.

[This report is further confirmation that Crimean-Congo haemarrhagic fever virus is present (and probably endemic) in northern India (see ProMED-mail archived report: Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever - India: (GJ) 20110123.0285).

This case is remarkable in the rapidity of onset of the disease, presumably a consequence of the nature of the exposure. The length of the incubation period for CCHF appears to depend on the mode of acquisition of the virus. Following infection via tick bite, the incubation period is usually one to 3 days, with a maximum of 9 days. The incubation period following contact with infected blood or tissues is usually 5 to 6 days, with a documented maximum of 13 days. Onset of symptoms is sudden, with fever, myalgia (aching muscles), dizziness, neck pain and stiffness, backache, headache, sore eyes and photophobia (sensitivity to light). There may be nausea, vomiting and sore throat early on, which may be accompanied by diarrhoea and generalised abdominal pain. Over the next few days, the patient may experience sharp mood swings, and may become confused and aggressive. After 2 to 4 days, the agitation may be replaced by sleepiness, depression and lassitude, and the abdominal pain may localize to the right upper quadrant, with detectable hepatomegaly (liver enlargement).

Other clinical signs which emerge include tachycardia, lymphadenopathy, and a petechial rash (a rash caused by bleeding into the skin), both on internal mucosal surfaces, such as in the mouth and throat, and on the skin. The petechiae may give way to ecchymoses (like a petechial rash, but covering larger areas) and other haemorrhagic phenomena such as melaena (bleeding from the upper bowel, passed as altered blood in the faeces), haematuria (blood in the urine), epistaxis (nosebleeds) and bleeding from the gums. There is usually evidence of hepatitis. The severely ill may develop hepatorenal (i.e., liver and kidney) and pulmonary failure after the 5th day of illness.

The mortality rate from CCHF is approximately 30 percent, with death occurring in the 2nd week of illness. In those patients who recover, improvement generally begins on the 9th or 10th day after the onset of illness. When patients with CCHF are admitted to hospital, there is a risk of nosocomial spread of infection. In the past, serious outbreaks have occurred in this way and it is imperative that adequate infection control measures be observed to prevent this disastrous outcome. Patients with suspected or confirmed CCHF should be isolated and cared for using barrier nursing techniques. Specimens of blood or tissues taken for diagnostic purposes should be collected and handled using universal precautions. Sharps (needles and other penetrating surgical instruments) and body wastes should be safely disposed of using appropriate decontamination procedures.

General supportive therapy is the mainstay of patient management in CCHF. Intensive monitoring to guide volume and blood component replacement is required. The antiviral drug ribavirin has been used in treatment of established CCHF infection with apparent benefit. Both oral and intravenous formulations seem to be effective. There is no protective vaccine. (From:http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs208/en/index.html).
