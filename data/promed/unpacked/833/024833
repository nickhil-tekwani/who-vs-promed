I want to give you further information on the case of haemorrhagic fever in
Germany. In the German TV/newspapers the case was described like this:
On TV they told the German public it could be a case of Ebola or Lassa, and
results of tests will be available today. The patient is aged 39, he
currently lies in a ward in the Virchow-Klinik in Berlin called
Sonderisolierstation. This is a special [isolation ward constructed for
patients infected with dangerous microorganisms. He flew back to
Frankfurt/Oder and went on to airport Berlin/Tegel. He arrived there from a
journey to Elfenbeinkuste (Ivory Coast) in Africa.
Yesterday the man was described as being very ill, but you can talk to him.
He had internal bleeding [according to Norbert Suttorp, director of the
Infectious Disease Clinic of Virchow-Klinik. The man shot some film for 2
weeks and returned on Sunday. He felt ill and was taken to a German hospital
in Frankfurt/Oder. On Tuesday he was brought to Berlin. The ward 59 in
Berlin which I described has an air filtering system and no personnel from
this ward can leave it.

Second German quarantined in Ebola scare
----------------------------------------
A second man was in quarantine in Germany on Thursday after a friend who had
accompanied him to West Africa was rushed into hospital with a mystery
illness that doctors fear could be the killer virus Ebola.
The second man, who health officials said had shown no sign of illness so
far, returned from a two-week working trip to Ivory Coast on Sunday with a
40-year-old film-maker who was airlifted to Berlin's isolation hospital on
Tuesday.
The results of blood tests on the sick man, from the eastern border town of
Frankfurt-an-der-Oder, were expected later on Thursday. Medical staff were
treating him wearing hermetically sealed suits and breathing apparatus.
He is suspected to be suffering viral haemorrhagic fever. Its symptoms can
be caused by four potentially fatal tropical viruses: Ebola, Marburg, Lassa
and dengue, medical experts said.
[Tha last hemorrhagic fever scare in Germany, in 1997, turned out to be a
false alarm due to a defective lab test (see: Lassa fever - Germany (02):
NOT 970927004525) - Mod.JW
Ebola is one of the deadliest viruses known and kills by causing high fever
and severe bleeding. An outbreak in 1995 in Zaire, now the Democratic
Republic of Congo, killed 81 percent of its victims.
Although the man's illness is unknown, the erection of a 2-metre high
fence around the ward patrolled by security guards has sparked frenzied
media speculation about the risk he may have infected passengers on his
return flights from Africa.
Health authorities said any threat that the man might have infected others
on his flights from the Ivory Coast via Zurich to Berlin was minimal as he
had not reported any symptoms until during [sic the actual journey.
Swissair, the airline with which the 2 men and their partners returned
from Africa, said it had made its passenger lists available to the German
health authorities and were able to identify who had sat nearby.
"But we have no decision on what the illness is and therefore what
precautions to take as yet,'' Swissair spokesman Erwin Schaerer told
Reuters. He said he had no knowledge of other passengers being contacted
yet.
The cameraman's wife and the girlfriend of the second man were not in
quarantine but being carefully monitored along with the medical staff who
attended the cameraman in his home town before being transferred by
helicopter to Berlin.
Two help lines were set up to answer the public's questions.

Fears of Ebola virus outbreak in Europe
-----------------------------------------
[Byline: Roger Boyes
Germany was on Ebola fever alert yesterday after a man returned from a trip
to Africa bleeding through his eyes and ears.
Ebola, which is one of the most infectious and deadly viruses, killing up to
80 per cent of its victims, is virtually unkown in the West.
The patient, a 40-year-old German citizen, returned from a business trip in
the Ivory Coast at the weekend. He travelled via Zurich on Swissair to
Berlin and the German authorities are trying to track down passengers who
may have had contact with him. The infected man was accompanied by his wife,
who is now in quarantine, as is their child.
The whole of the Virchow Clinic quarantine unit has been cleared for Olaf U.
Doctors and nurses are wearing airtight safety uniforms reminiscent of the
film
Outbreak, which depicted the dangers of a virus such as Ebola.
The hospital said the clinic would need 2 more days of laboratory tests to
determine whether the illness -- identified only as a "viral haemorrhagic
fever" - was
Ebola or the less dangerous but highly infectious Lassa fever.
Until then the hospital was taking the precautions normally associated with
an Ebola outbreak. The patient was taken to hospital by helicopter to avoid
ground contact.
In Berne last night, Swissair confirmed that [the passenger had caught its
flight from Abidjan with 188 passengers on board. Airline executives had
decided not to contact any of the passengers unless doctors in Berlin
determined it was Ebola.
--
[Hemorrhagic fevers have never been transmitted through the air to other
people. When a passenger seriously ill with Ebola virus flew from Gabon to
South Africa & died in hspital there, neither of his 2 companions or any
other passengers caught it (see: Ebola - South Africa (02) 961117184708) -

[The main new bit of info here is that his wife and child are confined too,
and that over 100 people are being examined - LC
[The patient was brought for safety confinement to the Virchow Clinic in
Berlin with his wife and child because he was bleeding through his eyes and
ears.
The British Broadcasting Corp. reports today that [the patient´s biologist
companion has not yet shown any signs of illness, and that health officials
are now saying it is unlikely that whatever afflicts [him passed on to
anyone else. [But the BBC also reports more than 100 people who've come
into contact with the 2 men are undergoing thorough check-ups.
A tropical disease alert has arisen in Germany before. In 1967 seven people
died following an outbreak of the Marburg virus in Frankfurt.

Suspected German Ebola Man Fights For Life
-------------------------------------------
[By Deborah Cole
A German who returned from a trip to West Africa at the weekend was in a
worsening condition in a Berlin hospital Thursday as he battled what doctors
said might be the killer Ebola virus.
Lying in a sterile plastic tent and treated by medical staff wearing
hermetically sealed clothing, the 40-year-old television cameraman needed
emergency treatment as his liver and kidneys began to fail.
A friend who accompanied him to the Ivory Coast was also in quarantine,
health officials said. But along with Ullman's wife and the second man's
girlfriend, who also made the trip, he was showing no symptoms.
"The patient's health has unfortunately deteriorated,'' hospital spokeswoman
Kerstin Ullrich told reporters. "He is confused. He doesn't know who he is
or who is around him. The people in direct contact with the patient can
only reach him through plastic, with plastic gloves.''
All that can be done is to treat symptoms and hope the patient pulls
through.
Hans-Herbert Schmitz, a virology expert at Hamburg's Berhard Nocht Institute
for Tropical Medicine who has experience of working with Ebola in Africa,
said: "There has never been a case in Europe where an Ebola patient has
infected someone else. So it is unlikely the virus will be passed on here.''
--
[The only known case of Ebola in Europe was in 1976, when a [research
scientist at Porton Down laboratory in Britain accidentally pricked himself
with an infected needle. He survived. (Source: BBC News. 5 Aug 1999
http://news.bbc.co.uk/ ). A European veterinarian who survived infection
with the closely-related Marburg virus during the 1967 outbreak passed the
virus to his wife during convalescence. But there is absolutely no evidence
from outbreaks in Africa that Ebola virus can be passed through the air -
