About 30 hectares of tomato gardens in Bawku West district, Upper East, have been destroyed by the bacteria _Ralstonia solanacearum_. The disease was identified by the Savannah Agricultural Research Institute (SARI). Farmers complained about the difficulty in accessing certified seed, forcing them to use the old varieties that were susceptible to diseases. [A] farmer [said], "For the past 15 years, I have never experienced such disease in this area; it destroyed my farm within a day."

The Ministry of Food and Agriculture (MOFA) confirmed the destruction and said farmers were advised to stop cultivating tomatoes for some time and diversify or practise crop rotation, while a treatment regime was used to treat the bacteria. [MOFA] urged farmers to adopt the cultivation of certified and improved seeds that could withstand diseases and harsh weather conditions to avoid the reoccurrence of crop loss.

Other districts near Bawku West have not registered any kind of crop infection so far. The Binduri district director of agriculture [said they are] working closely with farmers and sensitised them on the various diseases of vegetables and the need to report any incidence of abnormality. [He pointed out the] unavailability of improved seeds for commercial cultivation of tomatoes and urged stakeholders to address the issue by making certified and improved seeds of vegetables available to farmers.

[Bacterial wilt (BW; also called southern BW) caused by _Ralstonia solanacearum_ (Rs; previously _Pseudomonas s._) is one of the major diseases of tomato and other solanaceous crops. It is most severe in tropical and subtropical areas with high rainfall and warm temperatures. Symptoms on tomato include wilting of the youngest leaves, which may recover temporarily during cooler evenings; eventually the whole plant wilts permanently, and roots and lower portion of the stem develop browning of the vascular system; invaded roots may rot and plants may die.

The bacteria are spread by mechanical means (including insect activities), contaminated equipment, infected plant material, soil, and water. They can survive in soil on plant debris or roots of hosts. Some solanaceous weeds and volunteer crop plants may serve as pathogen reservoirs. Disease management is difficult, relying mostly on exclusion from new areas and use of certified clean tomato explants for planting. Some cultural methods (such as crop rotation), control of pathogen reservoirs, and phytosanitary measures may be used. Grafting susceptible tomato varieties onto rootstocks of resistant aubergine lines is widely practiced in some Asian countries. Tomato varieties with some genetic resistance/tolerance exist, but due to the different strains of the pathogen may not be suitable for all regions. Breeding programmes to develop resistant tomato varieties suitable for local conditions are needed.

Members of the Rs species complex affect more than 200 plant species including many important crops (for example, causing brown rot of potato, moko disease of banana). They have been classified into various races and biovars that are active under different climatic conditions and in different hosts.
