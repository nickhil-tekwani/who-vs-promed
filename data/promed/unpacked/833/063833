[1] Pfizer/BioNTech COVID vaccine
[A]
Date: Mon 9 Nov 2020

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/11/9/covid-19-vaccine-is-90-effective-pfizer-and-biontech


Pfizer Inc says its experimental COVID-19 vaccine is more than 90-percent effective, a major victory in the fight against a pandemic that has killed more than a million people, battered the world's economy, and upended daily life. Pfizer and German partner BioNTech SE are the 1st drugmakers to release successful data from a large-scale clinical trial of a coronavirus vaccine. The companies said they have so far found no serious safety concerns and expect to seek US authorisation this month [November 2020] for emergency use of the vaccine for people aged 16 to 85.

"Today is a great day for science and humanity," Albert Bourla, Pfizer's chairman and chief executive, said. "We are reaching this critical milestone in our vaccine development programme at a time when the world needs it most with infection rates setting new records, hospitals nearing over-capacity and economies struggling to reopen."

For Pfizer to seek US authorisation for emergency use of its vaccine, it will need 2 months of safety data from about half the study's 44 000 participants, which is expected late this month. "I'm near ecstatic," Bill Gruber, one of Pfizer's top vaccine scientists, said in an interview. "This is a great day for public health and for the potential to get us all out of the circumstances we're now in."

1.3 billion doses
Gloria Taliani, professor of Infectious Diseases at the Sapienza University of Rome, Italy, called the result an "incredible breakthrough" as she expected the vaccine to be effective in just 75 percent of the subjects. The next steps, Taliani explained to Al Jazeera, will consist in examining "who received the vaccine during the 1st trial in order to extend it to other populations which are much more in need to be vaccinated," including older people and those with other coexisting diseases who were "probably not included in the 1st trial."

"But the unanswered question is, how much will it cost? And how less rich countries will be able to afford it?," she added. Pfizer and BioNTech have a USD 1.95bn contract with the US government to deliver 100 million vaccine doses beginning this year [2020]. They have also reached supply agreements with the European Union, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Japan. To save time, the companies began manufacturing the vaccine before they knew whether it would be effective. They now expect to produce up to 50 million doses, or enough to protect 25 million people this year [2020]. Pfizer said it expects to produce up to 1.3 billion doses of the vaccine in 2021.

The US pharmaceutical giant said the interim analysis was conducted after 94 participants in the trial developed COVID-19, examining how many of them had received the vaccine versus a placebo. The company did not break down exactly how many of those who fell ill received the vaccine. Still, more than 90 percent effectiveness implies that no more than 8 of the 94 people who caught COVID-19 had been given the vaccine, which was administered in 2 shots about 3 weeks apart. The efficacy rate is well above the 50-percent effectiveness required by the US Food and Drug Administration for a coronavirus vaccine. To confirm the efficacy rate, Pfizer said it would continue the trial until there are 164 COVID-19 cases among participants. Given the recent spike in US infection rates, that number could be reached by early December [2020], Gruber said.

The data have yet to be peer-reviewed or published in a medical journal. Pfizer said it would do so once it has results from the entire trial.

Global race
The global race for a vaccine has seen wealthier countries forge multibillion-dollar supply deals with drugmakers like Pfizer, AstraZeneca Plc, and Johnson & Johnson, raising questions over when middle income and poorer nations will get access to inoculations. The US's quest for a vaccine has been the Trump administration's central response to the pandemic. The US has the world's highest known number of COVID-19 cases and deaths, with more than 10 million infections and more than 237 000 fatalities.

Vaccines are seen as essential tools to help end the health crisis that has shuttered businesses and left millions out of work. Millions of children whose schools were closed in March [2020] remain in remote learning programmes.

Dozens of drugmakers and research groups around the globe have been racing to develop vaccines against COVID-19, which on Sunday [8 Nov 2020] exceeded 50 million infections since the new coronavirus was first recorded late last year [2019] in China [see Undiagnosed pneumonia: China (HU): RFI 20191230.6864153 from 30 Dec 2019. - Mod.MPP]

[These preliminary results from Pfizer's phase III clinical trial look very promising, and that is wonderful news. But the data have yet to be analyzed by age group, exacerbating health problems, gender, and case description, that is, proportion asymptomatic vs mild vs severe (although no severe cases were reported in this trial), and virus transmissibility, as well as duration of protection. Once the study is complete and reaches its intended goal, Pfizer should make the detailed results available to the public. But for now, good news is always welcome! It should be noted that development of this vaccine does not fall under Operation Warp Speed (a public-private partnership, initiated by the Trump administration, to accelerate control of the COVID-19 pandemic by advancing development, manufacturing, and distribution of vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics).

According to a separate report from Bloomberg News (https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-09/pfizer-s-covid-vaccine-prevents-90-of-infections-in-large-study) kindly forwarded by Mary Marshall (<mjm2020@googlemail.com>):

"Assuming the vaccine clears the final hurdles, attention will rapidly shift to rolling it out across the world. The challenges will [still] be immense: The companies have agreed to supply deals with the US government and with other countries, but it's widely expected that front-line medical personnel, essential workers, and at-risk groups will receive any authorized shot first.

"US states have been working on distribution plans, but many can't finalize arrangements until it's clear what shot will be given, as the top candidates have varying requirements for storage and transport. Pfizer's vaccine, for example, must be kept at ultracold temperatures.

"The rollout of vaccines requires the near-flawless execution of an interconnected chain of processes," according to a 21 Oct 2020 report from the Boston Consulting Group. In addition to handling the products, officials will need to mount public education and outreach campaigns, monitor whether vaccines have any safety or efficacy issues once they reach a broader population."

[B] Why vaccine success has broader significance
Date: Mon 9 Nov2020
Source: STAT News [abridged, edited]
https://www.statnews.com/2020/11/09/four-reasons-for-encouragement-based-on-pfizers-covid-19-vaccine-results/


Embedded in the announcement is broader good news for COVID-19 vaccine development. Here are 4 reasons for encouragement based on the early results, starting with the most important.

- We are likely to have multiple successful COVID-19 vaccines.
The Pfizer vaccine targets the spike protein, the knobby protrusion on the SARS-CoV-2 virus that allows the virus to attach to and invade human cells, initiating infection. In fact, all of the vaccines being developed by major manufacturers working with Operation Warp Speed, the US government effort to fast-track vaccines, target the spike protein. There have been at least theoretical concerns that this was the vaccine development equivalent of putting all our eggs in one basket. The interim Pfizer data suggests the basket is the right one.

"There was always a discussion: Is the spike protein the right target? Well, now we know it's the right target," Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told STAT on Monday [9 Nov 2020]. "So, it's not only immediate good news, it really is optimistic about what's going to roll out in the next several months with the other vaccines."

That forecast applies globally. All the vaccines being developed with the help of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations -- which has been funding research and production with the aim of producing vaccine for worldwide distribution -- target the spike protein. "We believe these interim results also increase the probability of success of other COVID-19 candidate vaccines which use a similar approach," CEPI CEO Richard Hatchett said in a statement.

- This is terrific news for mRNA vaccines.
The 2 frontrunners in the race to develop COVID vaccines are Pfizer and Moderna; both use a new vaccine production technology known as mRNA. (Other manufacturers, including vaccines giant Sanofi, are developing mRNA vaccines, but they are not as far along in the work.) Research has been underway for years on this innovative approach to make vaccines, but to date no mRNA vaccine has been brought to market.

The platform offers huge promise, both in terms of how quickly a vaccine can be designed and how quickly batches can be made. But there are no givens in vaccine development. Until something is shown to work, you don't know that it will. Pfizer's early results will likely have sparked celebrations too in the Cambridge, Massachusetts, offices of Moderna. "It validates the mRNA platform," Fauci said. "You have every reason to believe, unless something strange happens, that Moderna will likely have similar results." That would be extra sweet news for Fauci. The vaccine construct Moderna is developing was created in NIAID's vaccine research center.

- We may be able to expect more from COVID-19 vaccines than we thought. That could help persuade people to be vaccinated.
It's early and, as Fauci told STAT on Monday [9 Nov 2020]], we don't want to get ahead of ourselves. Plus, it's important to note that at this point, there's no way to estimate how long protection from this or any COVID vaccine would last. The duration of protection will only become clear after the vaccines are in use for a while.

But there has been a fear with COVID vaccines that they might not be super protective. Many vaccines targeting pathogens that invade our respiratory tracts -- think flu vaccine -- don't generate terrific immune responses. The relatively low bar the Food and Drug Administration set for COVID vaccines was seen by many as lowering expectations. The FDA told manufacturers in guidance issued in June [2020] that it would accept a vaccine that reduces the risk of symptomatic COVID by 50%.

"This vaccine could be more effective than we ever hoped for from the 1st generation of COVID-19 vaccines," Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust, said in a statement. That could be very good news not just for people who get the Pfizer vaccine, if and when it gets cleared for use. It could also boost confidence in COVID vaccines. As presidential politics have swirled around the development and approval of the Operation Warp Speed vaccines, polls have shown that the public was becoming wary of them.

If the early promise of the Pfizer vaccine holds, that could really help persuade people that getting vaccinated against the SARS-2 virus is worthwhile, Fauci said. "Vaccine hesitancy diminishes proportionately inversely with the efficacy of a vaccine," he said. "I think this is going to go a long way to diminishing the vaccine hesitancy that we see."

- Pfizer's vaccine's long-term prospects now look better.
Pfizer's vaccine will almost certainly be the 1st to be authorized by the FDA. But it's also going to be the hardest one to use. The vaccine has to be shipped and stored at ultra-cold temperatures, -94 Fahrenheit (-70 Celsius). That requirement will limit where the vaccine can be used. Moderna's mRNA vaccine must be stored at -4 F (-20 C), which is not ideal, but not quite as challenging. Still, a vaccine that might be 90% efficacious becomes more attractive -- regardless of distribution challenges.

Moncef Slaoui, co-chair of Operation Warp Speed, told STAT last week that the storage requirements have been a topic of discussion between the US government and Pfizer. The Pfizer vaccine is not being developed as part of Operation Warp Speed, but the US has pre-purchased 100 million doses of it, with an option to buy an additional 500 million more. "There were tradeoffs in their case between the speed with which vaccine would be available and identifying the right formulation that would be stable," Slaoui said.

"Both [Pfizer and Moderna] are working on improving the stability, the cold chain requirements to at least 2 C-8 C (35 F-45 F) degrees," he said, referring to standard refrigerator temperature. "And I am confident they will find solutions."

A recent event with a mutation in a cluster of cases related to mink farming in Denmark becomes the elephant in the room. Will that mutation "escape" into the general population, and will the efficacy of the vaccine remain high against that viral mutation?

Since the [15 Oct 2020] PAHO/WHO Epidemiological Update on COVID-19 [3] and as of [8 Nov 2020], an additional 11 874 437 confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported globally, including 166 688 deaths, bringing the cumulative number of confirmed cases reported globally to 49 578 590, including 1 245 717 deaths.

As of [8 Nov 2020], of the global total, WHO Region of the Americas and the WHO European Region, represent 70% of the total confirmed cases and 78% of the total deaths. The Region of the Americas represents 43% (21 370 015) of the total confirmed cases and 53% (654 512) of the total deaths and the European Region represents 26% (13 135 548) of the total cases and 25% (311 336) of the total deaths.

Since the [15 Oct 2020] PAHO/WHO Epidemiological Update on COVID-19 [3], the European Region as the highest relative increase in cases and deaths, with 6 026 767 additional cases (46%) including 62 838 deaths (20%) (Figure 1)

Figure 1: Distribution of COVID-19 cumulative confirmed cases by WHO Region and epidemiological week (EW). EW 1-44 of 2020.

Situation summary in the region of the Americas
-----------------------------------------------
All 54 countries and territories in the Region of the Americas have reported COVID-19 cases and deaths. [4] Since the [15 Oct 2020] PAHO/WHO Epidemiological Update on COVID-19 [3] and as of [5 Nov 2020], 592 561 additional confirmed cases of COVID-19, including 54 832 deaths, have been reported in the Region of the Americas, representing a 14.3% increase in cases and a 8.5% increase in deaths.

In the last 7 weeks (between [16 Sep 2020] and [4 Nov 2020]), a relative increase was observed, both in the number of cases and number of deaths across all subregions (Figures 2 and 3). The highest increase was observed in Central America subregion [5], with a 30.7% increase in cases and a 24.9% increase in deaths, followed by the North America subregion [6], with a 29.8% increase in cases and a 17.6% increase in deaths, the Caribbean and the Atlantic Ocean Islands subregion [7], with a 29.7% increase in cases and an 24.4% increase in deaths, and the South America subregion [8], with a 26.1% increase in cases and a 22.3% increase in deaths.

In the last 7 weeks, a relative increase in confirmed cases greater than 50% (range 52.0% to 80.8%) is observed in the Bahamas, Belize, Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba [9], Curacao, Dominica, Guadeloupe, Guyana, Jamaica, Martinique, Paraguay, Saint Barthelemy, and Saint Lucia. With respect to deaths, a relative increase of greater than or equal to 50% (range 50.0% to 80.5%) is observed in Argentina, the Bahamas, Belize, Bonaire, Sint Eustatius, and Saba, [9] Costa Rica, Guadeloupe, Guyana, Jamaica, Paraguay, and Saint Martin.

Epidemiological highlights
--------------------------
I. COVID-19 during pregnancy
Since the 1st reported cases of COVID-19 in the Americas and until [5 Nov 2020], 98 767 pregnant women positives for SARS-CoV-2 were reported, including 549 deaths (1%), in 18 countries/territories for which information was available (Table 1).

In Mexico, since the confirmation of the 1st COVID-19 cases [10] in the country until [3 Nov 2020], there were 196 cases of pregnant women and postpartum women positive for SARS-CoV2 among indigenous populations, including 3 deaths (1.5%). Of these women, 6.0% are hospitalized in serious condition.

In Panama, since the confirmation of the 1st case of COVID-19 in the country [11] until [17 Oct 2020], 903 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in pregnant and postpartum women were reported, including 4 deaths (0.4%). The 4 health regions that concentrate most COVID-19 cases among pregnant women (59%) are Metropolitana (25%), Panama Oeste (21%), San Miguelito (14%), and Chiriqui (9%). Regarding deaths, a review and analysis of existing evidence (autopsy and file audit) of the 8 cases previously reported as COVID-19 deaths among pregnant women [3], was conducted by the Panama National Commission for Maternal and Perinatal Mortality and found only 4 were directly due to COVID-19.

In Uruguay, since the confirmation of the 1st COVID-19 cases in the country [12] until [30 Oct 2020], 20 SARS-COV-2 positive cases were reported among pregnant women, with no deaths reported among them. One of the cases was hospitalized. As of [30 Oct 2020], 16 of the cases were recovered and 4 remain active cases.

Table 1: Number of pregnant women positives for SARS-CoV-2 and deaths, and the maternal mortality ratio (MMR), by country. Region of the Americas. [1 Jan 2020] to [5 Nov 2020].

II. COVID-19 among indigenous populations
Since the 1st confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the Region of the Americas and as of [5 Nov 2020], there have been 187 095 confirmed cases of COVID-19, including 3572 deaths, reported among indigenous populations in 14 countries in the Region of the Americas for which information was available (Table 2). Compared to the data in the [15 Oct 2020] PAHO/WHO Epidemiological Update [3] this represents an increase of 32 760 confirmed cases including 167 deaths. The largest relative increase [13] in cases occurred in Canada and Guatemala, while Venezuela has the largest relative increase in the number of deaths reported.

In Brazil, since the confirmation of the 1st cases of COVID-19 [14] in the country and until [24 Oct 2020], in the Indigenous Health Subsystem (SASISUS, per its acronym in Portuguese), the 34 Special Indigenous Health Districts (DSEI, per its acronym in Portuguese) reported 32 041 confirmed COVID-19 cases, including 471 deaths (1.5%) among the DSEI.

The COVID-19 incidence rate among indigenous persons seen by SASISUS was 4238.8 cases per 100 000 population and the case fatality rate was 62.3 per 100 000 population. The Northern region presents the highest number of cases (19 123), with an incidence rate of 5026.9 per 100 000 population; this region concentrates 50% of the indigenous population of the DSEI (380 412 population). The Central-West region presents the highest case fatality rate (2.5%), being 1.7 times higher than the general fatality rate among the DSEI (1.5%).

In decreasing order, the highest incidence rates were observed in the following DSEIs: Kaiapo do Para (18 378.2 per 100 000 population), Cuiaba (17 371.9 per 100 000 population, Altamira (15 326 per 100 000 population), and Kaiapo do Mato Grosso (14 391.7 per 100 000 population). The DSEIs with the highest case fatality rates were Cuiaba (310.9 per 100 000 population) followed by Vilhena (254.3 per 100 000 population) and Xavante (198.3 per 100 000 population) (Table 3).

Table 3: Confirmed cases of COVID-19 and deaths, incidence rate, mortality, and case fatality rates by DSEI. Brazil, [25 Feb 2020] to [24 Oct 2020].

III. Multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS) in children and adolescents temporally related to COVID-19 [16]
On 15 May 2020, WHO issued a Scientific Brief [17] on multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS) in children and adolescents temporally related to COVID-19 in response to reports initially received from Europe and North America regarding clusters of children and adolescents requiring admission to intensive care units with a multisystem inflammatory condition with some features similar to those of Kawasaki disease and toxic shock syndrome. MIS has been characterized as an acute illness accompanied by a hyperinflammatory syndrome, leading to multiorgan failure and shock. While the scientific knowledge base regarding MIS continues to evolve, MIS has been observed temporally in relation to COVID-19.

As of [6 Nov 2020], a total of 17 countries/territories in the Region of the Americas have officially reported to PAHO/WHO or published information on an official website a total of 2032 cumulative confirmed cases of MIS temporally related to COVID-19, including 63 deaths (Table 4). This figure represents a relative increase of 13% (263 additional cases) in cases and 5% (3 additional deaths) in deaths compared to the data published in the [15 Oct 2020] PAHO/WHO Epidemiological Update [3]. Since the [15 Oct 2020] update, Guadeloupe has been added to the list of countries/territories that have reported confirmed cases of MIS.

Additionally, as of [6 Nov 2020], 23 countries/territories have officially reported to PAHO/WHO there have been no cases of MIS detected.

According to information shared by 17 countries/territories in the Region of the Americas, the 1st cases of MIS in the region were detected in epidemiological week (EW) 15 of 2020 [week ending 11 Apr 2020]. Since then, until EW 44 of 2020 [week ending 31 Oct 2020], on average 66 cases have been reported weekly in the Americas. However, the data must be interpreted with caution, as not all countries/territories have reported their cases by epidemiological week (Figure 4) and not all countries/territories are applying the same confirmed case definition. Brazil, Chile, and the United States of America account for 89% of the confirmed cases in the region; the United States represents 57% of that total. Regarding confirmed deaths, Brazil and the United States of America represent 54% and 32% of the total, respectively.

As mentioned in the [15 Oct 2020] PAHO/WHO Epidemiological Update [3], it must be noted that since June 2020, case reports and case series have been published regarding a multisystem inflammatory syndrome in adults (MIS-A), similar to that presented in children.[18].

Table 4: Distribution of officially reported confirmed cases and deaths of multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS) in children and adolescents temporally related to COVID-19 in the Region of the Americas, by country/territory, as of [6 Nov 2020].)
Figure 4: Confirmed MIS cases in the Region of the Americas. EW 15 to EW 44 of 2020).

IV. COVID-19 among healthcare workers
Since the confirmation of the 1st COVID-19 cases in the Region of the Americas until [1 Nov 2020], 851 868 confirmed cases were reported, including 2503 deaths (0.3%) in health care workers from 27 countries/territories in the Americas, from which information is available.

In the United States of America, a study [19] was carried out of 438 adults hospitalized between [1 Mar 2020] and 31 May 2020, who met the definition of healthcare personnel (HCP) [20], and analyzed according to the classification made by the COVID-19 Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network (COVID-NET). Data on the health of the health workforce was collected by sites representing 98 counties in 13 states. [21] Of the 438 cases analyzed that met the criteria for the study, 71.9% were women. The median age was 49 years (interquartile range, 38-57 years), 52.0% were non-Hispanic black, 27.4% were non-Hispanic white, and 8.6% were Hispanic or Latino. Of the total, 67.4% worked in occupations where they were generally expected to have direct contact with patients, 36.3% carried out a nursing related occupation [22] and 6.6% were assistants to patients and caregivers. Regarding underlying medical conditions 89.8% had at least one, of which obesity was reported most frequently (72.5%), followed by hypertension (40.6%) and diabetes (30.9%). 27.5% were admitted to an intensive care unit, 15.8% required invasive mechanical ventilation, and 4.2% died during hospitalization.

The findings in the report are subject to at least 5 limitations [23]; probably one of the most important from a public health point of view is the fact that COVID-NET does not collect data on exposure history. It is unknown if the HCP was exposed to SARS-CoV-2 in the workplace or in the community, highlighting the need for community prevention efforts and infection prevention and control measures in healthcare settings.

In Paraguay, between [13 Mar 2020] and [2 Nov 2020], 15 486 exposures to COVID-19 cases have been reported in health care workers, of which 4176 were confirmed, including 16 deaths. A total of 3998 of these cases [have recovered]. Of the total deaths among the health care workers, 8 correspond to nursing personnel, 4 to physicians, and the remaining 4 to general services personnel. Regarding the sociodemographic characteristics, 6 were among the age group of 40 to 50 years, 4 were among the 51 to 61 years age group, 3 were 62 years old or older, 2 were among the 29-39 age group, and 1 among the 18-28 age group; 8 (50%) cases were male. With respect to geographic distribution 5 were from the Alto Parana health region, 5 from the Central health region, 4 from the Capital, 1 from Concepcion, and 1 from Itapua.

- The Americas region reported 53.2% of daily case numbers (compared with 9.8% yesterday) and 55.0% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours (compared with 23.3% yesterday), maintaining its position as the most severely affected region, having reported more than 21.7 million cases. A reminder that in yesterday's post we noted that "Countries not reporting new cases in the past 24 hours include the USA and Brazil among others so the total regional daily load is approximately 25% of the usual daily reports." Reports from the USA and Brazil today reflect 2 days' worth of reports and should be taken into consideration when interpreting today's report. The USA is dominant, followed by Brazil, Colombia, Argentina, Mexico, Canada, and Peru. Chile, and Ecuador reported more than 1000 new cases in the past 24 hours.

- The European region reported 32.7% of daily case numbers (compared with 68.3% yesterday) and 26.9% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours (compared with 48.8% yesterday), and total cumulative cases reported exceed 13.3 million. Countries not reporting cases today (9 Nov 2020) include Spain, Israel, Switzerland, Kazakhstan, and Sweden. Countries reporting more than 10 000 cases in the past 24 hours include France, followed by Italy, Poland, Russia, UK, and Germany. There were 17 additional countries reporting more than 1000 new cases in the past 24 hours.

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 4.5% of daily case numbers and 9.1% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 3.33 million cases. Iran is dominant, with continuing record-breaking highs, followed by Morocco, Jordan, Iraq, Tunisia, Pakistan, Lebanon, UAE, and Libya. Oman, Palestinian Authority, and Kuwait each reported more than 500 cases but fewer than 1000, while Sudan, Somalia, and Yemen have not reported any cases in the past 48 hours.

- The African region reported 0.68% of daily case numbers and 0.60% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours and has reported more than 1.36 million cases. South Africa is dominant, followed by Kenya, Ethiopia, Ghana, Uganda, Nigeria, Mozambique, and Madagascar. Countries not reporting any new cases in the past 24 hours include Algeria, Cameroon, Cote d'Ivoire, Gabon, and Botswana, among others.

- The Western Pacific region reported 0.68% of daily case numbers and 0.81% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of 0.76 million cases. The Philippines is dominant followed by Japan, Malaysia, South Korea, Guam, and China.

- The South East Asia region reported 8.2% of the daily newly reported cases and 7.6% of reported deaths in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 9.6 million cases. As previously, India remains dominant, followed by Indonesia, Nepal, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, and the Maldives.

Impression: It is very difficult to comment other than observe the continued dominance of Europe and the America's region. Today's [9 Nov 2020] weekend artifact includes many countries in Europe and Africa that have not submitted reports with major excess reports from the Americas region with the USA and Brazil submitting 2 days' worth of newly confirmed cases.

On the Overview tab at the WHO source URL, the epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases by WHO region, 30 Dec 2019 through 9 Nov 2020, is an excellent visual representation of the pandemic. - Mod.MPP]

[In the past 24 hours, the USA (133 476), Spain (38 191), and India (37 211), have been dominant. A global total of 7140 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (8-9 Nov 2020). The global total is now above 51.2 million cases. Countries not reporting newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours include Pakistan and Sweden among other countries. Spain and Switzerland had not reported in 3 days so numbers may include delayed reports.

Countries reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours (12 countries) include the USA, Spain, India, Italy (25 269), Russia (21 798), Poland (21 713), UK (21 350), France (20 155), Switzerland (17 309), Germany (16 465), Brazil (11 651), and Iran (10 463). A total of 45 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 23 of the 45 countries reporting more than 1000 newly confirmed cases are from the European region, 9 are from the Americas region, 6 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 5 are from the South East Asia region, 1 is from the Western Pacific region, and one is from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have increased by 10.7%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 23.9%. Looking at the same comparisons in the USA, as the dominant country worldwide with clearly uncontrolled transmission, the 7-day change in daily reported cases is 41.3% and in reported deaths is 25.2%.

Impression: Even with the weekend reporting artifact leading to reduced reporting, the global daily reported cases continue to increase having crossed the 51 million mark, and the daily increase is just above 500 000 new cases. Countries in the European and the Americas regions are still showing the largest increases in daily new case counts, followed by the Eastern Mediterranean and the South East Asia regions.

All in all, the growth in the USA is exponential, having surpassed the 10 million cumulative case mark, with the state of Texas having reported over one million cases and California will be crossing one million cases in the next several days if daily reports continue at the same rate. - Mod.MPP]
