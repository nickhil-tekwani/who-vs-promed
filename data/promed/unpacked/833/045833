Mosquitoborne dengue fever is fast spreading in Madhya Pradesh, with the
disease having claimed at least 9 lives in the past 3 months and affecting
more than 300 people, health officials said on Thursday [8 Oct 2009].

Though at least 192 cases of dengue have been confirmed by the Bhopal-based
Gandhi Medical College alone, the district malaria officer Padmakar
Tripathi last week [week of 28 Sep 2009] put the figure at 103 confirmed
cases. The government, however, still put the number of those affected by
dengue in the capital at 57 and 163 in the entire state.

"We get at least 10 to 15 dengue patients every day and the hospital is
almost full," said Ajay Goenka, a doctor with the private Chirayu Hospital
here. Private practitioners say that the actual number of dengue affected
people will be much higher if the patients in private hospitals and rural
areas are taken into account. Gopal Batini, a doctor with the private
Ayushman Hospital also said that the number of patients would be much
higher than the official figures. "The hospital is almost full because of
dengue," he said.

Director (of health) of Madhya Pradesh government Ashok Sharma told IANS:
"9 people have died from dengue in Madhya Pradesh in the past 3 months,
while 129 others -- of which 57 are in the state capital -- are affected by
the disease. It's true that most dengue patients, as many as 57, were in
the state capital, followed by 33 in Indore, 17 in Balaghat, and 12 in
other districts. 3 people died of dengue in Bhopal and Indore each. One
each succumbed in Ashoknagar, Satna, and Balaghat."

Sharma claimed that necessary steps had been taken to control dengue and
the district medical officers had been directed to remain in contact with
private hospitals and send information about those affected. But a source
in the state health department said: "Surprisingly, none of the
government-run hospitals have single donor platelet phaeresis (SDPP)
machines -- the mechanism required for collection of platelets and plasma
for effective treatment of dengue cases." Secretary of Health Department SR
Mohanty said that procurement of the SDPP machines for Indore, Bhopal,
Ujjain, and Jabalpur hospitals was in the pipeline and they would be made
available soon.

The Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) yesterday [4 Oct 2009] warned of a
possible outbreak of dengue after the present rainy season. Chief medical
officer of the CMC Dr Pradeep Kariyawasam told the Daily Mirror yesterday
[4 Oct 2009] that there may be a possible outbreak by November [2009] after
the ongoing rainy season. "An outbreak usually occurs after a rainy season
and there may be one later this year," he said.

He said there had been 52 cases of dengue during the last month. Around 60
per cent of the cases had been between the ages of 5 to 20 [years].

Dr Kariyawasam said the CMC had already launched a school based programme
under which a meeting was held for school principals recently. The
principals were asked to clean their respective schools first and then
clean up the surroundings. He explained that at least a radius of 200 yards
[about 180 m] around the schools have to be kept clean as the flying range
of mosquitoes are usually 150 yards [about 140 m]. He also said the schools
have been asked not to build waterfalls and ponds within the school premises.

"We have taken this stand as the environments in most of the schools in the
city are not in a good condition," he said. He said putting up new
buildings had also polluted the environment in some instances. In some
schools, gutters in the buildings have not been cleaned and mosquito larvae
have been found in these gutters in some schools.

He said classrooms in many schools were dark and it was easy for the
mosquitoes to survive. Dr Kariyawasam said the CMC carried out a similar
school based programme last year [2008] as well and it was a success. He
said he was confident of carrying out a successful campaign this year
[2009] as well.

Meanwhile, he said, volunteers were being trained to carry out the Cuban
system of eradicating dengue.

The seasonal illnesses like dengue have been spreading fast in different
parts of the city [Dhaka] for over a month. The city's public and private
hospitals are witnessing an increased number of dengue patients. Private
practitioners are also getting a large number of such patients.

Medical experts said frequent changes in weather and taking contaminated
water are main reasons for the occurrence of such seasonal illnesses.

Some 319 people have been diagnosed with dengue fever till yesterday [5 Oct
2009], chief entomologist of Dhaka City Corporation (DCC) Naseem-Us-Seraj
told The Daily Star. The patients with dengue fever, a viral disease
transmitted by the _Aedes [aegypti]_ mosquito, could be increased now
though generally it reduces during this time (September-October), he said.

Residents of Dhanmondi, Kalabagan, Central Road, Minto Road, Siddeswari,
Muhammadpur, Ganderia, and Mirpur areas are falling victim to dengue virus,
said the DCC official. At least 37 patients from outside of Dhaka got
admitted to the city's different hospitals in last week, he informed.

A total of 300 dengue patients have been admitted to the city hospitals
between June and September [2009], said the control room of the directorate
general of health services.

The breeding ground of _Aedes_ mosquitoes is clear water in containers and
flowerpots, abandoned tires, and coconut shells just around the houses
where the DCC spray teams or cleaners are not allowed. The house owners can
protect themselves from the danger of the deadly disease if they take
initiatives to destroy those breeding grounds, DCC officials said.

The Cavite Provincial Health Office tagged as false a report that there is
dengue epidemic in Dasmarinas town. Sanitary inspector Anabelle R Dilig
made the clarification amid a report that there were 5 dengue deaths in the
province's most populated town. "While it is true that there were 5 dengue
deaths in Dasmarinas, the report that there is a dengue outbreak in the
town is false. The epidemic threshold can attest to this," said Dilig.

The Dasmarinas Health Office confirmed earlier that the dengue fatalities
in the town are 3 children, a 9 month old baby, and a 38 year old man. The
victims are residents of Barangays [smallest administrative division] San
Dionisio, Victoria Reyes, Zone III, Paliparan I, and City Homes in Langkaan
II, it was gathered. Dilig said to sum it all, there are 80 dengue cases,
including the 5 deaths, in Dasmarinas during the August-September [2009]
period. "The fact is we were able to contain the disease before it reached
alarming proportion," said the provincial dengue coordinating officer.

Dilig claimed that the epidemic threshold or the examination and survey
made in the last 5 years will decide if there is a dengue outbreak in the
town. Dlig said the provincial health office is doing everything to check
the dengue cases not only in Dasmarinas town but the whole of Cavite.

[5] Dominican Republic

A baby of 7 months raised to 3 the list of DHF deaths in the Dominican
Republic in the past 2 weeks, according to a medical report released today
[25 Sep 2009]. The child was admitted into hospital in his home province of
Santiago (in northern DR), days ago, suffering the disease, which is
endemic in Central America and the Caribbean. The physicians' efforts were
not sufficient to save his life.

This is the 2nd minor [age child] who died of the same cause in this
province in the last 7 days and the 3rd in the country, according to
official statistics.

Health media urged authorities to launch an awareness campaign about the
disease and the population to adopt domestic sanitary measures to avoid
proliferation of the mosquito vector that transmits the disease [virus].

A source in the hospital where the child had been admitted said that there
were more children admitted for the same cause [disease], but declined to
give precise figures and details about how many were affected with the same
type of disease.

The most visible direct cause of the dengue outbreak in the Cibao region
[the whole northern part of the Dominican territory] is the [accumulation]
of stagnant water from the copious rains that have fallen in recent weeks,
said medical sources. The resurgence of dengue during the hurricane season
and spring, when rain is most copious in the Caribbean, is a constant
[factor] that every year costs lives.
