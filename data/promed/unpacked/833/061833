In Viedma, a 9 year old child was referred to an emergency health center in
Bahia Blanca, after being confirmed at the hospital Artemide Zatti of
Viedma to have contracted the so-called hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS).
Meanwhile, another other 13 people were treated days ago in the local
hospital for cases of _Salmonella_ infection.

Salmonellosis was manifested in 2 isolated cases and a family outbreak that
affected 3 people, as seen in laboratory studies. Meanwhile, another family
outbreak is affecting 8 persons. With regard to this outbreak, while not
confirmed, the hospital suspects that the food that caused the disease was
insufficiently cooked pork.

The 9 year old boy with HUS was transferred to a pediatric nephrology
center in Bahia Blanca.

[On 1st glance, this posting may be suggesting that the salmonellosis cases
were linked to the case of hemolytic uremic syndrome. It is not stated if
salmonellae or VTEC producing _E. coli_ were isolated from the HUS case.
Several previous reports have linked salmonellosis, both serotype Typhi and
non-typhoid strains to HUS (1-4). But a more detailed study of 2 such cases
(5) suggested that a co-infection with _E. coli_ O157 and the salmonellosis
had occurred. The abstract of this 1997 paper is as follows:

"Escherichia coli O157:H7, a Shiga-like toxin (SLT)-producing enteric
pathogen, has been implicated in most cases of post-diarrheal hemolytic
uremic syndrome (D+HUS). Infection with other bacterial pathogens such as
_Salmonella_ has also preceded D+HUS episodes, leading to speculation that
these organisms may also be etiological. We present 2 children with
unrelated D+HUS following salmonellosis. Both children had negative stool
cultures on sorbitol-MacConkey agar soon after the onset of diarrhea. After
the diagnosis of HUS, both patients had repeat stool cultures positive for
_Salmonella_ alone. Polymerase chain reactions for SLT I and II gene
sequences in _Salmonella_ isolates were negative. Enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay for specific humoral response to _E. coli_ O157:H7
lipopolysaccharide in acute and convalescent serum samples revealed
evidence of heretofore undetected _E. coli_ O157:H7 infection
contemporaneous with each D+HUS episode. These cases demonstrate that
isolation of only non-SLT-producing microbes from children with D+HUS
should raise suspicion of concurrent undetected infection with
SLT-producing organisms. Assaying specific immune response to _E. coli_
O157:H7 can be an important epidemiological adjunct. Bacterial infection
with non-SLT-producing _Salmonella_ may represent concomitant enteric
pathology rather than D+HUS-instigating infection."

A subsequent report failed to show evidence of antibody formation against
the lipopolysaccharide of _E. coli_ O157 (6) but a non-O157 isolate might
have played a role. Of note, no Shiga toxin genes were also not found in
the _S._ Typhi isolate.
