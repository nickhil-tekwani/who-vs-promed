Equine influenza - Australia (NSW, QLD): summary situation report,
issued at 2.00 PM [Australia time] Sat 1 Sep 2007
----------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Key Points
--------------
Equine Influenza (EI) was 1st detected at Eastern Creek Quarantine
Station (ECQS), Sydney, New South Wales (NSW), Australia, on 17 Aug
2007. Sick horses were seen on 22 Aug 2007 at Centennial Parklands
Equestrian Centre (CPEC) in Sydney.
There are currently 63 infected premises (IPs) in Australia; 9 of
these are in Queensland (Qld) and the remainder in NSW. There are
currently more than 310 dangerous contact properties (DCPs) being
assessed and more than 280 are in NSW.
Numerous horses at Randwick racecourse in Sydney have tested
positive. The Randwick racecourse complex is one IP and the disease
is expected to spread within this population of racehorses.
At this stage it is not possible to identify the index case. A
standstill continues to apply to all equines in the jurisdictions of
Queensland, New South Wales, and the Australian Capital Territory.
Other jurisdictions have relaxed movement restrictions based on a
risk assessment process agreed by all of the state and territory
Chief Veterinary Officers (CVOs) and the Australian CVO.
Almost all IPs continue to be detected on the basis of tracing
information. There has been evidence of lateral spread between farms
in some peri-urban areas. Extension efforts to encourage high levels
of bio-security are continuing.
2. Current situation
----------------------
Laboratory results from AAHL (Australian Animal Health Laboratory)
have shown the virus from the 1st 2 IPs, multiple other locations in
NSW, and from Warwick, Qld, to be H3 Equine Influenza.
New South Wales
---------------
Infected premises have been confirmed in the following locations:
Aberdeen, Arcadia, Berry, Cattai, Charmhaven, Clarendon, Cooranbong,
Eagleton, Eastern Cree, Glenhaven, Glenorie, Gloucester, Glossodia,
Kulnurra, Kurrajong, Londonderry, McCullys Gap, Maitland, Moonbi,
Moree, Moore Park, Mount Hunter, Muswellbrook, Palm Grove, Parkes,
Pitt Town, Quakers Hill, Randwick, Raymond Terrace, Redfern, Scone,
Terry Hie Hie, Timbumburi, Tintinhul, and Wilberforce.
Eastern Creek Quarantine Station
--------------------------------
All horses are being monitored. Of the 50 swabs taken from horses on
23 Aug 2007, 4 have returned positive PCR (polymerase chain reaction)
results. NSW has declared an air exclusion zone for one nautical mile
[1852 m] around and for 700 feet [213.36 m] above the ECQS facility.
Queensland
----------
The IPs are at Warwick (2), Minden (2), Rosewood (2), Brisbane west
(2), and Tamborine (1). A total of 6 sites have been identified
linked to a Narrabri horse event with a number of horses showing
clinical signs consistent with EI. Most horses at the Morgan Park
site at Warwick have now exhibited clinical signs of respiratory disease.
Other jurisdictions
-------------------
Surveillance activities in all states continue unchanged. Suspect
cases of EI must be reported to state authorities. It is an offence
not to report.
3. Response
---------------
A Local Disease Control Centre (LDCC) has been established at the NSW
DPI's (Department of Primary Industries) Elizabeth Macarthur
Agricultural Institute (EMAI) at Menangle via Camden just south of
Sydney. Queensland has established a local disease control centre
(LDCC) at Toowoomba and a State Disease Central Headquarters (SDCHQ)
in Brisbane.
10 km (6.2 mi) restricted areas have been declared around each of the
IPs. No movement of horses is permitted within, into, or out of these
areas. Further tracing of horse movements onto and off newly detected
IPs is being urgently undertaken. All tracing cases are being
investigated and inspected according to a formal protocol.
The public is being asked to report all horses with a fever and
respiratory signs to the LDCC for follow up.
