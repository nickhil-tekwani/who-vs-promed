Bulgaria bans pork imports from Romania due to swine vesicular disease
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Bulgaria banned pork imports from neighbouring Romania in order to prevent
the spread of a contagious pig disease in the country, the Bulgarian
agriculture ministry revealed.
Cases of swine vesicular disease (SVD), a viral illness, have already been
reported in Romania, the statement added.
SVD is clinically indistinguishable from foot-and-mouth disease but is
caused by a completely different virus. It does not affect humans but is
highly contagious and can be lethal to livestock.
The ban on imports does not concern meat that has passed thermal or chemical
treatment, which guarantees the destruction of the SVD virus, the ministry
added.

[No information on SVD in Romania is available on OIE's epidemiological data
base or from EU's Animal Disease Notification System (ADNS), last updated 11
Mar 2005. The only European country which has reported SVD during 2005 is
Italy (6 outbreaks, last confirmation 4 Mar 2005; see
<http://europa.eu.int/comm/food/animal/diseases/adns/index_en.htm>).
According to Romania's last annual report to the OIE, the SVD has been
absent since 1985.
We thus presently regard the alleged Romanian outbreak as suspected, and
will appreciate a confirmation or -- hopefully -- denial. - Mod.AS]
