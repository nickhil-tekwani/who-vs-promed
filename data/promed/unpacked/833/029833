[The above report by the Israeli Veterinary Services was submitted to the
OIE on 25 Jun 2009; we regard this information, currently not available on
the OIE website, as of potential interest to subscribers.

Kefar Tappuah is an Israeli settlement in the West Bank; see map at
<http://healthmap.org/promed/en?name=Kefar%20Tappuah,%20West%20Bank,%20Palestinian%20Territory&g=283310&v=32.117,35.233,5>.
Its location can also be shown on the interactive map at
<http://www.eyeonisrael.com/Israel-touring-map.html>. For this end, the
above given latitude and longitude should be applied.

The serotyping of the causative agent is being investigated by the virology
division of the Kimron Veterinary Institute; results are anticipated -- and
requested -- with interest. Whatever virus it turns to out be, it may
reflect the epidemiological situation within the adjacent animal population
of the West Bank Palestinian autonomy territory.

According to the 2009 Molecular Epidemiology (ME) report of the World
Reference Laboratory for FMD (WRLFMD, Pirbright, UK), on top of the FMDV
serotype O, known to be endemic in the region, another serotype, namely
serotype A, topotype Asia, strain Iran-05, is currently spreading within
the region. This strain, against which previous vaccine strains did not
provide satisfactory protection, has already been identified in Bahrain,
Egypt, Iraq, Iran, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, and Turkey. In Bahrain, serotype
Asia 1 has been identified as well. The ME reports (2009) page is available
at <http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/2009.htm>.

According to the said page, 60 samples from Israel and 34 samples from the
Palestinian Autonomy are currently included under the title "sequencing in
progress". - Mod.AS]
