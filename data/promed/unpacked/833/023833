A 59 year old man from San Pedro del Ycuamandyyu is admitted to the
Hospital Central del Instituto de Prevision Social (IPS) [Central
Hospital of Social Welfare] with a confirmed clinical picture of
hantavirus [infection].

Dr Mario Martinez, of the hospital epidemiology department, stated
that the patient had acquired the disease [infection] while working
in construction in the district of Teniente Irala Fernandez of the
Presidente Hayes department [state or province equivalent].

"The patient reported that he had had contact with rodents that
transmit the disease [virus]. Luckily, the patient had timely medical
consultation," said the physician. He added [he] is in stable
condition, in a clinical medicine ward and with oxygen assistance.

The man had initial symptoms this past 15 Sep [2010] and on 17 Sep
2010 came to the hospital after suffering respiratory difficulties.
The virus is acquired after inhaling dust particles contaminated with
feces, urine, or saliva from the rodent _Calomys laucha_, and
produces symptoms such as fever, general malaise, and respiratory problems.

[Although this report does not mention which hantavirus is involved
in this case, previous reports of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in
this area of Paraguay were attributed to Laguna Negra virus. The
small vesper mouse, _Calomys laucha_, is the principal rodent host
for Laguna Negra hantavirus in central Chaco of western Paraguay.
This virus has also been found in lowland Bolivia and western Brazil.
Laguna Negra virus has also been detected in _Calomys callosus_ and
_Akodon simulator_ in northern Argentina. I am not aware of any
confirmed instances of human-to-human transmission of Laguna Negra
virus as it has been for Andes hantavirus.

The article above is another example of the popular press reporting
cases as if there was just one hantavirus involved in human disease
in South America, when, in fact, there are several. However,
determining which hantavirus is involved in these cases requires a
sophisticated virology laboratory.
