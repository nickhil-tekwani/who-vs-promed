According to Georgia's National Food Agency, laboratory tests could not confirm the involvement of an infectious agent in the sheep mortality. The agency's specialists are of the opinion that the lambs suffered from their lengthy transportation without proper maintenance conditions and feeding, violating the required terms of maintenance during this period. The specialists continue to control the situation at the request of the National Food Agency.

[An earlier posting on this event (20150527.3390022) included media-derived information on mortality in sheep apparently exported from Georgia to Jordan several weeks earlier, rejected "for unclear reasons" and subsequently returned. "Locals in Uplistsikhe, in Georgia's Kartli region," said many sheep "were dying from an unknown disease." We published a request for information as follows:

"What are the clinical symptoms/post mortem findings? What are the ages, breed, sex of the susceptible population and of the affected animals? Are these males (for immediate slaughter/fattening), breeding female animals, otherwise, or mixed? Any medical treatments applied prior to or during the travel (drenching, spraying, vaccinations)? What were the dates of export/import? The mode of transportation? Density on vehicles? Reason for rejection? Last but not least: What was the diagnosis?"

We are grateful to Merritt Clifton, Jason Mier and Lyn White for their valuable efforts to unravel the route of the sheep consignment, which seems to have been refused entry to both Jordan and Saudi Arabia before returning to Georgia.

Unless new information confirms a disease, it may be concluded that the recorded deaths were caused by lengthy transportation under unsatisfactory conditions, to say the least.

The alleged rejection of the consignment in Saudia and Jordan is reminiscent of several earlier events leading to sheep suffering sickness and mortality following their rejection at Middle East destinations. The most recent event of large proportions was related to a consignment of Australian sheep which was rejected in the fall of 2012 in Bahrain, ending up in Pakistan (references in the See Also section below). - Mod.AS
