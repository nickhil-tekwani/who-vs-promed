UNDIAGNOSED DISEASES, DATE PALM - QATAR

As the only tree capable of growing in the driest areas, the date palm provides Qatar and countries in similar climates with a necessary source of food, income, aesthetics, and shade. However, the same conditions in which the date palms can thrive also provide breeding grounds for disease, and as a result, 30 percent of Qatar's date palm yields are lost annually.

Osman Radwan, Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Sciences [University of Illinois], is part of an international collaboration towards finding important genes that are involved in the date palm's tolerance or resistance to disease. Transfer of the knowledge that is being developed will help Qatar and other countries improve their date palms so that they can better survive diseases, drought, and other stresses.

[Date palm (_Phoenix dactylifera_) is cultivated in many hot, dry regions as a staple food source. Trees can live for more than 100 years. A large number of fungi and a number of other pathogens, as well as several diseases of unknown aetiology have been reported for this crop. Date palm production is facing serious problems worldwide, including lack of research, pests, and spread of diseases. Productivity of the crop has declined globally. Environmental stress factors may predispose the trees to pathogen attacks. Reliable diagnosis of pathogens affecting specific areas is needed to be able to design effective disease management strategies.

A global date palm network was established by the Food and Agricultural Organisation of the United Nations (FAO) to promote research and exchange of information. Tissue culture programmes for crop improvement that could be used to produce disease-free replanting material have been established in some countries (for example Pakistan, see ProMED-mail post 20090806.2776). Identification of genes associated with disease resistance, as mentioned above, should provide a basis for breeding disease resistant palm cultivars suitable for specific areas.
