Mozambique cassava crop infected by mosaic virus
-------------------------------------------------
At least 20 per cent of cassava plantations in the southern Mozambican
district of Panda [Inhambane province] have been destroyed by mosaic virus.
The virus infected about 9000 hectares [22 239 acres] of the 47 000
hectares [116 140 acres] of crops in the area. The loss of the cassava, a
staple in the region, may result in pockets of hunger in the district.

The mosaic virus is transmitted by white flies and cuttings from infected
plants and can reduce yields by as much as 40 per cent.

[Cassava mosaic disease (CMD) has triggered food emergencies in the past by
destroying cassava crops throughout whole regions. It is caused by a number
of species and strains in the genus _Begomovirus_ which seem to be
associated with it in different areas. Co-infections as well as genetic
recombination between strains have also been reported, and recombinant
strains can be particularly virulent.

CMD symptoms include leaf mosaic, distortion and stunting of plants leading
to severe reduction of tuber yields. The CMD viruses are spread by whitefly
vectors and with infected plant material (including seed tubers). At least
one of them (_African cassava mosaic virus_; ACMV) has also been found in
an alternative host (soybean) suggesting that these viruses may have a
wider host reservoir and may pose a threat to other crops as well. Disease
management for begomoviruses usually relies on control of their vectors as
well as pathogen and/or vector reservoir plants, but these methods have
proven unsatisfactory in developing countries.

Because most traditional cassava cultivars are susceptible to CMD,
varieties resistant to different viral strains are being developed for
local use. In Africa, this has alleviated the problem in some areas, but in
others, the new varieties are being wiped out by _Cassava brown streak
virus_ (CBSV). A new strain of CBSV affecting areas previously free of the
disease, such as high altitudes, has recently emerged in Kenya, Tanzania
and Mozambique affecting additional CMD resistant cassava cultivars
(ProMED-mail post 20100525.1735). Development of crop varieties with stable
resistance to multiple viruses is particularly difficult (see ProMED-mail
post 20090709.2463).
