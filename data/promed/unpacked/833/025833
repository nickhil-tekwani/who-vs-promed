Equine infectious anemia (EIA): note to industry/PVPs - 27 Jul 2006
-----------------------------------------------
Test results received by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries [DAF]
have confirmed 12 cases of equine infectious anemia (EIA). In addition to
14 premises that are currently restricted, upwards of 280 individual
animals are also restricted. The individual restrictions relate to horses
which, in the past 3 months, have passed through the farms on which
positive horses were located or an animal hospital on which a number of
infected animals were located. The number of animals restricted is expected
to increase as further in-contact animals are identified and traced. All
such horses will be subjected to a surveillance program determined by DAF
and will not be derestricted until they have satisfactorily completed that
program.
The Department is currently finalizing details of a package of financial
support for the robust surveillance regime under which it is insisting on
testing on restricted horses. This support will include a contribution to
the cost of the PVP [private veterinary practitioner] taking the sample as
well as paying for the cost of testing the sample at the IEC [Irish Equine
Centre]. Payments will be made directly to the PVPs and the laboratory.
Last weekend (22-24 Jul 2006), 4 new cases of EIA in 3 mares and a foal
were confirmed, and on 26 Jul 2006, a further 3 horses were confirmed with
EIA. All 7 cases had already been identified by the department as part of a
high-risk group, given their close contact with one or more of the earlier
confirmed cases. There are still a small number of horses alive who belong
to this high-risk group.
All of the cases confirmed in the past week fall within the incubation
timeframe for this disease and, accordingly, are not unexpected. Last
weekend's cases resulted in additional animal and premises restrictions,
and further animal restrictions as a result of this are expected as a
precautionary measure. No new additional premises were restricted as a
result of the confirmed cases on 26 Jul 2006.
In addition to the test results that are currently awaited in respect of a
small number of other suspect cases, onward tracing of in-contacts which
had left the country before the restriction and permitting system
implemented by DAF was in place have been notified to the relevant authorities.
The Department has received in excess of 2300 test results to date as part
of the ongoing tracing and surveillance of all potential in-contact cases.
The Department continues to advise stud owners/managers and other horse
owners to have their horses tested for any evidence of the presence of the
disease as a precautionary measure and to maintain a high level of
bio-security, particularly with respect to the control of flies (including
the use of fly screens where appropriate).
The EIA virus is usually transmitted mechanically, most commonly through
blood-sucking insects or through the use of blood contaminated instruments
or needles. It is exclusively an animal health disease and has no human
health consequences.
Clinical signs of the disease in horses infected with EIA virus include
intermittent fever, small hemorrhages in the mucous membranes, anemia,
dependant swelling, and death. Pregnant mares suffering from the disease
may infect their foals transplacentally. Diagnosis is based on clinical
signs and a blood test for antibodies to the virus.
In view of the potential for mortality and given the high movement of
horses throughout the country over the past few months, horse owners are
being advised to be vigilant. The general incubation period for the disease
is variable, and there is no vaccine available. Veterinary practitioners
are advised to maintain strict aseptic techniques in the treatment of sick
horses at this time. The Department is particularly anxious that all these
reasonable steps should be taken to ensure that they can continue to
certify horses for export where such certification is required and to
facilitate ongoing inter-farm movement and the movement of horses to shows,
sales and other events.
In the event of further developments and as circumstances require, the
Department will update this briefing and make it available for the benefit
of the industry and practitioners.

Britain prepares for threat of swamp fever
------------------------------------------
Alarming echoes of the foot and mouth disease [FMD] crisis of 5 years ago
were evident yesterday [26 Jul 2006], as British racing prepared to mount
its defenses against swamp fever, a killer disease that has already struck
9 horses in Ireland.
Limiting and monitoring equine movement between the countries is likely to
be introduced imminently, and a complete ban is not ruled out. Some Irish
racecourses are already under threat of closure. A conference call is
planned for tomorrow [28 Jul 2006], involving leading British
administrators, officials from the Department for Environment, Food and
Rural Affairs (DEFRA) and key veterinary advisers.
Urgent action is almost guaranteed. Suspending horse movements between
Britain and Ireland would temporarily cripple the lucrative breeding
industry and also poses a threat to international racing competition.
Glorious Goodwood, at which the Aidan O'Brien-trained Ad Valorem is a
possible for the showpiece Sussex Stakes, could potentially be the 1st big
meeting affected.
The disease, correctly called equine infectious anemia (EIA), which causes
fever, emaciation and usually death, is spread by biting flies and was 1st
detected in Ireland last month [June 2006]. Concern has intensified this
week with the discovery of further cases, and, last night [26 Jul 2006],
Peter Webbon, chief executive of the Horseracing Regulatory Authority
(HRA), gave some unequivocal warnings. "We have to take this seriously," he
said. "It's a very unpleasant disease, and shouldn't be confused with
equine flu, in which horses will get sick but almost always recover. If you
have an outbreak of swamp fever, you will get deaths."
In his previous role as veterinary director of the Jockey Club, Webbon was
at the coalface of the FMD epidemic in 2001, and his cool head and reasoned
thinking drew widespread praise. Yesterday [26 Jul 2006], however, there
was no mistaking his level of anxiety over the new threat: "People might
draw comparisons with FMD, but the crucial difference is that swamp fever
is a horse disease, whereas FMD is not. There is much more logic in
restricting the movement of horses in these circumstances, but I'd remind
you that the Irish stopped all horses coming into their country during FMD.
The potential threats involve horses coming over from Ireland to race and
mares returning from studs in the infected areas. The number of returning
mares will outweigh the racehorses at this time of year. We understand and
believe that the Irish have done their best to contain the infection and
imposed movement restrictions, but you have to remember that flies are no
respecters of fences, and that makes this a highly contagious situation. We
have to decide how we deal with the risk to our horse population, and we
will have contingency measures in place even before Friday's conference
call. The 2 initial options are testing -- and 2 blood tests would be
necessary to guarantee a negative -- or a veterinary declaration that each
arriving horse had been free of any possible contact. It is a changing
situation that we need to keep under constant review. I don't envisage a
complete suspension of movement yet, but that may change."
In Ireland, still more serious measures are under consideration, with a
spokesman for the Department of Agriculture confirming that the closure of
certain racecourses and sales grounds is "a possibility".
British sales companies have met with government and veterinary figures in
Ireland and requested testing procedures for all horses sent across for
auctions, beginning with the Doncaster August sale in a fortnight.
Meanwhile, it has been revealed that the outbreak began with a horse sent
for treatment at the Troytown Veterinary Hospital in Kildare, Ireland's
best-known center for sick and injured racehorses.
A horse from a stud in Co Meath was admitted in mid-June 2006 and was found
to be so sick it was quickly put down. EIA was retrospectively diagnosed,
and other horses at the center were affected. The Troytown has been closed
indefinitely while the spread of the disease is monitored.

Disease factsheet: equine infectious anemia, updated 27 Jul 2006
-------------------------------------------
Definition:
Infectious equine anemia (EIA) or "swamp fever" is a virus disease of
horses, which causes intermittent fever, anemia, emaciation, and death. It
can be transmitted by mechanical transfer of blood by biting insects and
occurs typically in low-lying swampy areas. The disease was 1st described
in France in 1843. The term "swamp fever" was 1st used by Torrance in 1903
in Canada, where this disease had been known before 1882.
History and spread of the disease:
Although the infectious nature of this disease had long been suspected, a
viral case was not definitely established until 1904. The virus was
classified as a retrovirus in 1976 and later grouped with the lentiviruses
(that is, non-tumor forming exogenous retroviruses) of which the human AIDS
virus is also a member.
EIA has a worldwide distribution. Early in the 20th century, serious
outbreaks occurred in France, Japan and America. During the decade 1980 to
1989, the disease was reported in many parts of America, Asia (India,
Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Thailand) Europe (Austria, France, Greece,
Italy, Romania, USSR and Yugoslavia) and Australia.
Current situation:
The authorities in the Republic of Ireland (ROI) announced on 15 Jun 2006
that they had found EIA in horses on 2 stud farms. Some horses from those
stud farms, which may have been exposed to the disease, had been sent to
the UK. The State Veterinary Service acted quickly to ensure these horses
were isolated and tested for the disease. 11 horses were placed under
restrictions in England, Wales and Scotland. All of these have now tested
negative on at least one occasion and the majority on 2 occasions.
Further cases of EIA have since been confirmed in ROI, and test results are
awaited for a small number of other suspected cases. All animals involved
were previously identified and restricted as high risk due to very close
contact with an earlier confirmed case. The authorities in the ROI informed
us today on 25 Jul 2006 of 8 UK tracings subsequent to these new
confirmations. These tracings have been located, and restrictions have been
put in place with initial sampling being undertaken.
All horses that have been put under restrictions and will remain so until
DEFRA is content that they present no risk.
No cases of suspicion of EIA have been reported to DEFRA, and all testing
of any horses resident in the UK have been negative. To date, in excess of
2200 tests for EIA have now been undertaken in the ROI, with negative results.
Epidemiology:
This disease occurs in horses, mules, and donkeys. Animals may be acutely,
chronically, or subclinically affected. The incubation period varies from a
matter of days to a few months but generally is between one and 3 weeks.
Antibodies usually develop 7 to 14 days after infection and last for life.
Postmortem:
These depend upon the stage of the disease. Hemorrhages, edema, and
jaundice occur in the acute disease: enlargement of the liver, spleen and
lymph nodes are common in the chronic stage.
Control:
This is based on the restriction of movement of suspected animals and their
contacts combined with clinical observation.
