PHRI/Soros Russian Infectious Disease Program
Progress Report
Dr. Alexander Goldfarb
PHRI Project Director
January 29, 1998

Introduction
This program is carried out by PHRI under a $12.3 million grant from the
Open Society Institute (Soros Foundation). The program is part of the $500
million pledge of aid to Russia made by Mr. Soros last October. The aim of
this program is to combat emerging infectious diseases in Russia, with
special emphasis on TB. In the program budget, approximately $9.5M has
been allocated for TB, $1M to hospital infections, and $1.5M for operations.
This report covers the period from project inception in October 1997
through the end of January 1998, and is divided into three sections:
1. Tuberculosis
2. Hospital Infections
3. Infrastructure
Highlights
· The groundwork for Clinical Microbiology Laboratory at MMA has been
completed with regard to space preparation, personnel recruitment, purchase
of equipment and supplies. The first Russian team begins training in Canada
in February.
· A full TB control program is under way in Tomsk. This includes a
comprehensive reform of the regional TB service and provision of TB care in
the prison system. The program is the prototype for similar programs to be
implemented in other regions.
· TB control programs are in the development stage in Ivanovo, Marii El,
Nizhniy Novgorod and Leningrad oblasts.
· National TB resource centers have been established in three Moscow
research institutions.
· A comprehensive operational in-country infrastructure has been established.
· Several partnerships and alliances have been formed.

1. Tuberculosis
1.1. The problems and approach
Four specific problems are addressed by our TB program:
- The catastrophic rise of TB within the Russian prison system
- The presumed high incidence of multiple drug resistant TB, particularly
among inmates, compounded by general lack of reliable specific information
on this subject
- The resistance to the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended
Directly Observed Therapy - Short Course (DOTS) scheme from the old-school
Soviet TB establishment
- Waste and inefficiency in the regional TB control services; need of
health care management reform.
We have chosen to first tackle these issues in a single regional
demonstration project (Tomsk), and then expand to other regions...
2. Hospital Infections
With a budget of $1 million this project is aimed at establishing a
state-of-the-art clinical microbiology laboratory at the Ob/Gyn hospital at
the Moscow Medical Academy, which is a major teaching hospital in Russia.
The need for such laboratory stems from general weakness of microbiology in
Russian clinical practice, a major problem of the Russian health care
system. The laboratory is designed to become a teaching resource and
reference center on a national scale...
3. Infrastructure
PHRI has completed setting up its operational infrastructure to permit
smooth functioning of project administrative elements...
