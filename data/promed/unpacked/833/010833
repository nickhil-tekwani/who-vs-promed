["Since last August [2018], 30 outbreaks of ASF have been reported in China, spreading through 9 provinces. So far in October [2018], 7 outbreaks occurred, 5 of them in the province of Liaoning, in the northeast of the country, where the 1st case was reported 2 months ago. This peak in the number of outbreaks suggests the situation still remains far from under control.

"An outbreak in the city of Jinzhou was reported on [15 Oct 2018] by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs on its website, affecting the largest farm yet to report ASF (20 000 pigs), where 221 pigs died from the disease. This may suggest that the situation in China is continuing to escalate rather than idling. Reuters reported that Beijing Dabeinong Technology Group Co Ltd communicated the information about the outbreak to investors early today [16 Oct 2018] on an online interactive platform; unfortunately, the company could not immediately be reached for further comment. [Note: see ProMED-mail posting 20181016.6094089. - Mod.CRD]

"This outbreak has created a significant shift in the general perception that ASF outbreaks in China were limited to small farms with weaker biosecurity and fewer measures to guard against the spread of the disease. After multiple outbreaks in the cities of Anshan, Panjin, and Jinzhou in Liaoning province, pig prices have significantly decreased after farmers were unable to transport their herds out of infected provinces, while prices in the south have increased."
