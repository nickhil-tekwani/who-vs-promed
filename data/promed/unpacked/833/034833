The Equine Disease Communication Center (EDCC) reported on [5 Jul 2016], a new eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) case was confirmed in Jefferson County, Florida. The 1-year-old colt had received one previous vaccine against EEE and had no recent travel history. Clinical signs began on [24 Jun 2016] and the horse was euthanized for humane reasons the following day.

To date, 11 confirmed EEE cases have been reported in Florida in 6 counties -- Jefferson (2), Osceola (2), Palm Beach (1), Polk (4), Walton (1), and Washington (1).

No human EEE cases have been reported in Florida this year [2016] to date. In 2016, positive samples from 39 sentinel chickens have also been reported.

EEE causes inflammation or swelling of the brain and spinal cord and is usually fatal. Symptoms include impaired vision, aimless wandering, head pressing, circling, inability to swallow, irregular staggering gait, paralysis, convulsions, and death. Once a horse has been bitten by an infected mosquito, it may take 3 to 10 days for signs of the disease to appear.

[There is an excellent map of Florida embedded in this article. A Florida county map can be seen at http://geology.com/county-map/florida-county-map.gif.

This is an enzootic equine problem in Florida with outbreaks most years. As the disease can be fatal in horses, though mild usually in humans, its is very wise to have your horses vaccinated before the EEE season starts.
