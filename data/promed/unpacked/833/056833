Another suspected case of anthrax has been reported in Armenia's Martuni region. The patient is hospitalized, and doctors say the patient is in satisfactory condition, the "Hayots Ashkharh" daily reports.

"All suspected cases except for the last one with typical symptoms of anthrax have already been treated [in Armenia]. As a result of laboratory testing, 10 of the [previous] 55 suspected cases that were reported have been confirmed. There were no false symptoms, because the anthrax wound differs. In addition, the residents are so aware and so afraid that they see a doctor for every odd symptom. The [Agriculture Ministry's] State Service on Food Safety Press Secretary, Babken Pipoyan, noted that no new cases of anthrax had been reported among animals, so the [nearly 2-month long] supervision of meat shops has been lifted," Hayots Ashkharh writes.

[It is a peculiarity of clinical anthrax that onset can be delayed for weeks, even months. The reason why is obscure and must involve "latent" infection, but what we mean by that, I am not sure. In the Sverdlovsk incident in 1979, a street person died 6 weeks after the epidemic had seemingly ceased. As no new cases have been noted in livestock since late October 2012 [see 20121128.1428669], this case is either delayed in onset, or some contaminated meat was recovered from a freezer.

For a map of Armenia, see: http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/commonwealth/armenia_rel_2002.jpg. The named regions are all in central Armenia. If you visit: http://news.am/eng/search/?skey=anthrax, you can see 16 Armenian news reports going back as far as 20 Oct 2012.

Prior to this series of human and livestock cases, the disease had only been reported in cattle, with 4 outbreaks in 1999, 4 in 2000, one in 2001, none in 2002, not specified in 2003 and 2004, none in 2005, one in 2006, not specified in 2007, and none up to and including 2011; with 4 human cases in 1998, 1999 (1), 2000 (2), 2001 (18), 2002 (3), 2003 (2), 2004 (0), 2005 (1), 2006 (2), and 2008 (2); no zoonotic disease was reported in 2007.
Up until 2007, significant numbers of cattle, sheep and goats, horses and pigs were vaccinated each year. Latterly, vaccination numbers have fallen off. Whether this is just a failure to vaccinate or just more targeted programmes is unclear. If the cause or causes for these outbreaks could be determined, it would be possible to then reduce the annual incidence to zero and forget about it. The way these outbreaks are scattered about in central Armenia so late in the year makes me suspect that contaminated livestock feed might have been involved. If I were correct, and it would be possible to check by testing residual feeds now and in the future, prevention would be straightforward. - Mod.MHJ
