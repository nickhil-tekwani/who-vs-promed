A mysterious disease, declared by livestock officials as anthrax, has reportedly killed a number of animals in Bajaur Agency [Federally Administered Tribal Areas, FATA] over the last few days, locals told Dawn on Friday [10 Nov 2017].

They said several cattle had died of the disease during the past 2 weeks in various localities of Mamond and Khar tehsils. According to them, a number of cattle had also been infected with the disease.

The locals said the disease had panicked them, as they could not afford the loss of their precious animals.

The people said that following the deaths of the animals, officials of the local livestock department had visited the affected areas and obtained information about the disease. According to them, livestock officials examined the infected cattle and vaccinated a number of animals in the localities.

Meanwhile, livestock department officials said the disease might be anthrax. However, assistant director of livestock and dairy development, Dr Ahmad Younis, declared the disease as anthrax. But, he rejected the local people's claim that a number of cattle had been killed by the disease. He clarified that anthrax disease was reported in Chengazo area of Khar, where, so far, only one cow had been killed.

He said that soon after receiving information about the outbreak of the disease that teams had been dispatched to the affected area to administer anti-anthrax vaccines to cattle.

[According to the newswire from the 23 Aug 2017 ProMED report [Anthrax - Pakistan (03): (TA) bovine 20170823.5269716], they were due to be vaccinating in the Mamond area as well as the other affected village. In June 2017, the veterinary service was vaccinating livestock in Toda Cheena area of central Kurram Agency of the Federally Administered Tribal Areas in response to a suspected outbreak of anthrax; see 11 Jun 2017, Anthrax - Pakistan (02): (TA) livestock vaccinated 20170611.5098784. This was well received by the locals, and that experience will have aided the reporting of cattle deaths in the Mamond and Salarzai sub districts. Now that they are acquiring information on affected areas, the veterinary service can start planning to proactively vaccinate cattle in these areas next year [2018], in advance of the "anthrax season."

One of the advantages of vaccinating is that the livestock workers become more aware of the disease and the need to report. And, in parallel, the veterinary response must be thorough and truly efficient. Logically, it would be wise to widen the vaccination to cover regions that are at risk but have yet to publicly report sick and dead cattle.

For a description of Bajaur, go to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bajaur_Agency. Bajaur is on the northeast border of Pakistan with Afghanistan.

"Bajaur is inhabited almost exclusively by Tarkani (Tarkalani) Pashtuns, and there are their main sub-tribes in Bajaur: Utman Khel, Tarkalanri, Mamund (Kakazai, Wur, and Salarzai) as well as a small population of Safis. The Utman Khel are at the southeast of Bajaur, while Mamund are at the southwest, and the Tarkani are at the north of Bajaur. Its border with Afghanistan's Kunar province makes it of strategic importance to Pakistan and the region."
