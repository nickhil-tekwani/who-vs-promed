A measles outbreak in Britain has affected more than 800 people, and up to 2 million school children are believed to be unprotected due to a scare which linked the vaccine with autism, figures revealed. The outbreak is centered on the south Wales town of Swansea, but health experts warn there is a serious risk that the virus could spread, particularly in London, AFP reports.

Between 1996 and 2012, an average of 550 people contracted the disease each year in Britain, according to Health Protection Agency figures. Last year [2012], there were 2030 reported cases, a near-20-year high, and this latest epidemic has already infected 808 people.

Health officials pointed the finger at disgraced doctor Andrew Wakefield's 1998 report, which appeared in prestigious medical journal The Lancet, that linked the joint measles, mumps and rubella jab with autism. Many parents decided not to have their children immunized as a result. "Children are going to get measles, there is no question, because there is a great big group -- probably on the order of approaching 2 million children -- who are susceptible who have not been immunized," said doctor Helen Bedford, from the UCL [University College London] Institute of Child Health.

The government urged parents to vaccinate their children.

Parents in Wales are being urged to act quickly to vaccinate their children against measles as the number of cases hits 765. Around 72 cases of measles have been reported to Public Health Wales since Thursday [11 Apr 2013], and a total of 77 people have been hospitalised since the outbreak, the largest in the UK for over a decade, began.

Around 50 cases of measles were reported at the beginning of the year [2013] in Wales. This more than doubled to 288 in March 2013. So far, 257 cases have been reported this month [April 2013]. The measles virus is expected to spread further now that children have returned to school after the Easter holidays. It is estimated that around 5000 children still remain at risk from measles in the Swansea area alone.

Vaccinations are being offered to parents in the Swansea area, which has the highest reported number of cases, to try to end the outbreak and ensure children of all ages are protected against the 3 viral illnesses. Efforts are now being focused on older children who missed out on having the vaccination in the past in order to provide maximum protection to the community.

According to Public Health Wales' figures for October to December 2012, 89 per cent of children received the 2nd MMR dose by the age of 5. Experts believe to successfully eliminate measles, 95 per cent of a country's population needs to be immunised with 2 doses of the measles vaccine. While there is no guarantee that children vaccinated in the last 2 weeks will not contract measles, the virus is likely to be milder than if they had not received the vaccine, says Public Health Wales. Dr Marion Lyons, director of health protection for Public Health Wales, said: "Plenty of opportunities are being offered to parents to vaccinate their children against measles, but parents need to make sure they take these opportunities.

[3] UK (1st fatality)
Date: Fri 19 Apr 2013

The measles epidemic appears to have claimed its 1st victim after health officials confirmed that a young man who died was suffering from the disease. The death follows repeated warnings that the rising numbers of children and adults infected meant fatalities were likely. More than 800 cases of measles have now been confirmed in Wales, with experts predicting that number will double within weeks, and concerns that it could spread across the UK. Doctors have warned that up to 2 million children in England and Wales are at risk of contracting measles, because their parents refused to allow them to have vaccinations during the MMR scare.

The man, aged 25 of Port Tennant, Swansea, died on Thursday [18 Apr 2013] morning. Neighbours said he had been suffering from measles since last week, and they believed the new father may have contracted the disease from his baby daughter. They said he also had other health problems including asthma, which combined with measles could have led to his death. Tests on Friday [19 Apr 2013] confirmed that the victim was suffering from measles when he died, but the cause of death has yet to be established. Dr Marion Lyons, Director of Health Protection said: "Whatever the cause of death in this case, we should not be surprised if, as the outbreak grows, we start to see deaths."

Experts are now calling for a national "catch-up" campaign to prevent the disease spreading throughout the UK. There are particular concerns that the capital [London] is vulnerable. A decade ago, nearly half of young children in London did not receive vaccinations because of fears about a link made in research between MMR and autism, which was later discredited.

Health officials say that in developed countries, around one in every 1000 people who contracts measles will die, with yet more likely to suffer complications such as deafness and blindness. The last death from measles in the UK was in 2008, and before that, the last case of the disease killing an otherwise healthy person was in 1992, long before the MMR scare.

Latest figures revealed there are 808 confirmed cases of the disease in the outbreak in south Wales, including 77 patients being treated in hospital. Extra clinics are expected to be held at hospitals around Swansea this weekend with health officials anticipating a rush of parents and children wanting the jab. Health workers have also visited local schools to immunise hundreds of children.

Measles cases have been reported in Shropshire as the epidemic that began in South Wales spreads, it was revealed today [19 Apr 2013]. About 20 secondary schoolchildren in the Oswestry area have suspected measles, public health officials confirmed today. It has led to fears that the epidemic that started in Swansea is spreading eastwards.

There have been more than 40 suspected cases in Mid Wales, but this is the 1st time that children in Shropshire have been affected. Doctors today [19 Apr 2013] urged parents of children who have not received the MMR jab to contact their GP and arrange for the immunisation.

Shropshire's Director of Public Health Professor Rod Thomson said the children who had symptoms of the infection were at school in Wales but either lived in Shropshire or were registered with GPs in the Oswestry area. He said: "In this border area, there are many families who may live one side of the border but send their children to school or use a surgery on the other."

Measles can be potentially fatal, but all those showing symptoms this week are expected to make a full recovery. Professor Thomson added: "They are being kept away from school, and we are asking parents to make sure they do not come into contact with others, particularly from anyone who might be at risk if they caught the infection." He added that Shropshire had a vaccination rate far higher than the national average.

Powys teaching Local Health Board said 41 cases of measles had been recorded, mainly in the north of the county.

A case of measles has been confirmed at Devizes School, prompting the headteacher to urge parents to make sure their children are inoculated with the MMR vaccine. He said: "We have posted a letter on our website and are sending hard copies of this home with pupils, urging parents to make sure their children are protected from this potentially dangerous disease. The letter being sent home is from Maggie Rae, Wiltshire's director of public health. It reads: "Whilst the associated risk from this particular case is low, we wanted to take this opportunity to raise awareness of the importance of protecting children against measles, mumps and rubella (MMR)."

"An outbreak of measles such as in South Wales occurs when the number of people in a population who are not vaccinated against measles gets too high. "In Wiltshire, we have good uptake of the MMR vaccine. The MMR vaccination is the safest and most effective way to protect both the individual and those who cannot receive vaccination for any reason, for example because they are too young to have the vaccine or have a health condition which prevents receiving vaccinations.

A programme is being launched in schools after an outbreak of measles has seen rising numbers contracting the viral disease. Parents with children attending schools across the Tees Valley, including, Hartlepool, Billingham, Wolviston and Wynyard, will receive letters and consent forms over the next few days urging them to take up the offer of the MMR vaccination.

The Tees Outbreak Control team is responding to the current measles outbreak across the region that has seen 434 confirmed and suspected cases in the North-East. There have been 5 people from Hartlepool confirmed as having the viral disease and 75 from the Stockton area, which includes Billingham, Wolviston and Wynyard.

The jabs are being offered to all children who have yet to be vaccinated. The programme will be delivered in the Hartlepool and Stockton areas over the next few weeks by the school nursing team from North Tees and Hartlepool NHS Foundation Trust. Chairman of the Tees Outbreak Control Team and director of public health at Stockton Borough Council, Professor Peter Kelly, said: "Measles is a highly infectious disease, and people can feel very poorly when they have contracted it. 17 per cent of the current cases have required hospital treatment, and the disease can lead to rare yet serious complications. I would, therefore, urge all parents to get their child vaccinated through the school-based campaign if they have not been immunised already."

Debating an ongoing measles outbreak which has killed 36 children and hospitalised about 3588 in northern Nigeria, according to Senate figures, federal lawmakers say widespread suspicion and deliberate misinformation on the vaccine has aggravated the spread of the epidemic.

Also, Senators passed for 2nd reading a Bill for an Act to repeal the "archaic" 1926 Quarantine Act and enact the Nigeria Public Health (Quarantine Isolation and Emergency Health Matters Procedure) to prevent the introduction, spread of, and regulate steps for the containment of dangerous infectious and communicable diseases, organisms and agents in Nigeria. The Quarantine Bill was referred to the Senate committees on health and agriculture for further legislative work. The report is expected in 2 weeks.

Senate President David Mark accused certain interests of distorting facts about the vaccines for measles, polio and other preventable diseases for "political reasons." Coming on the heels of the recent killing of 10 polio vaccinators in Kano state, a proposal to provide security backup for vaccinators failed as Senators rejected the move at plenary. Mark's disclosure was a sequel to a motion for an "urgent sensitization and awareness campaign, and a supply of vaccines to measles affected areas," sponsored by Sen. Danladi Sankara (Jigawa, PDP) and 28 others.

Mark [stated]: "There is no doubt that people go about deliberately misinforming the ignorant in the society about the consequences of routine immunisation or vaccination. Well, some use it for political reasons. If you look at the states that are affected currently, it is more prevalent in the northern states, and I think that all of us from the northern states must have the courage to go back to our constituencies and educate our people that this (vaccination) is the right thing for them to do."

Public health officials from the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services are working with local health departments to investigate an outbreak of measles. To date, 7 cases have been identified in residents of Stokes and Orange Counties, according to a news release from the NC Department of Health and Human Services. Local public health departments are contacting other people who might have been exposed to these cases and providing vaccine to limit the spread of infection.

"Measles is very uncommon in North Carolina, so many people aren't aware of the symptoms," said Dr. Laura Gerald, State Health Director. "Measles spreads quickly, particularly in children and adults who aren't vaccinated. We want to make the public aware of this outbreak so individuals can take steps to protect themselves and their families."

Measles is a highly contagious disease that is spread through the air by coughing and sneezing. It also can be transmitted through contact with secretions from the nose or mouth of an infected person. Initial symptoms may include fever, runny nose, watery red eyes and cough. After a few days, a rash appears on the head and spreads over the entire body. Measles can lead to pneumonia and other complications, especially in young children. The disease poses serious risks for pregnant women, including miscarriage and premature birth.

Although the early symptoms of measles can be similar to those of many other infections, Dr. Gerald recommends that anyone with fever, a runny nose, watery red eyes and a cough should stay at home and limit contact with others to avoid spreading illness. If you develop a rash or if your symptoms worsen, call your doctor or seek medical care. If you do seek medical care, call your doctor's office or health care facility before you go so they can prepare for your visit and protect other patients from exposure.

Measles can be prevented by the combination MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine. It is important for all individuals 12 months of age and older to be vaccinated.

http://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/County-s-1st-reported-case-of-measlessince-4432426.php


Harris County's 1st case of measles in 2 years has been confirmed in a one-year-old child, officials said.

A positive laboratory test was reported last week for a child who lives on the county's north side, said Rita Obey, spokeswoman for Harris County Public Health and Environmental Services. So far, no other cases have been reported, Obey said Saturday [13 Apr 2013].

County health officials have attempted to notify everyone who was exposed to the child, including staff members at a medical office the child visited, she said. Because measles is highly contagious, exposure can occur by simply being in the same room as someone who is infected, she said. Anyone who was exposed to this child should be isolated from the 5th day after exposure to the 21st day, Obey said, except those who have been immunized for measles, mumps and rubella.

Measles is a reportable illness, meaning a physician or other provider who treats someone with the disease must report it to local health officials, Obey said. Since immunizations have made measles relatively rare, some doctors have never seen it, Obey said. The infected child had recently been out of the country, but there's no way to know where the disease was contracted, she said.
