Mumps Outbreak Not Related to Decline in MMMR Uptake
---------------------------------------------------
In fact this outbreak and similar ones like it elsewhere in the UK are not
a result of recent falls in MMR uptake -- they are affecting the wrong age
group for that -- but are as a result of previous vaccination policy.

They are occurring in an age group who are too old to have been recommended
2 doses of MMR -- this was introduced in the UK in 1996. Prior to that in
1994 there was a school based one-off campaign that offered all children at
school aged 5-18 measles and rubella (MR), but mumps was not included (the
campaign was run at short notice because of a predicted measles outbreak,
and it was not possible to obtain the mumps component in the timescale
required) -- there was a very high uptake for this of about 90-95 percent.

The age group now being affected by the mumps outbreaks would have been
part of this campaign, and it is interesting to note that whilst this age
group is suffering from mumps outbreaks, they are not being affected by
either measles or rubella, which were included in the school campaign.
Whilst I do not know the details of the currently reported Glasgow
outbreak, analyses of other similar outbreaks have shown most of the
affected children have received MR and either no dose or only one dose of MMR.

In contrast, there have been some local measles outbreaks in parts of the
UK in children under 5 and are the result of the falling MMR uptake.

Thank you for your interest in mumps in Scotland. One aspect to clarify,
though, is that the recent cases of mumps are almost all in teenagers and
young adults (ages 13-25 years; median/mean 19 years). The currently
increased incidence of mumps in Scotland is therefore due to these older
individuals not having had the opportunity to receive 2 doses of
mumps-containing vaccine (i.e. MMR) in the routine schedule, rather than
the recent decline in MMR vaccine uptake in young children.

Similar outbreaks have occurred elsewhere in the UK in the past few years.
Further information on the recent mumps cases is available in the latest
Weekly Report from the Scottish Centre for Infection and Environmental
Health (SCIEH).
