_Acinetobacter_, [_Pseudomonas_, and PER-1 enzyme.
[The prevalence of the PER-1 enzyme [gene, and its expression, in
_Acinetobacter_ sp. [has been described by Vahaboglu, H., et. al. [The
authors also described the enzyme in _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ [based upon
a nationwide study which was conducted in Turkey. The study was published
in recent issue of Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy. An abstract is
available at <http://asmusa.edoc.com/aac/v41n10/2265.html>.

[_Acinetobacter_ sp. and _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ are important agents of
nosocomial infections that routinely exhibit intrinsic resistance to many
beta lactam antibiotics. The PER-1 enzyme is an "extended spectrum" beta
lactamase (ESBL) that imparts resistance to anti-pseudomonal beta lactams
such as ceftazidime, piperacillin, and ticarcillin, rendering infections
caused by these nosocomial isolates even more difficult to treat. Unlike
most ESBLs, it appears that the gene for PER-1 is not derived from a gene
for one of the most common classical, plasmid associated, beta lactamase
genes. Based upon studies of prevalence and mobility among bacterial
strains in Turkey, the authors suspect that the PER-1 gene circulates on a
bacterial plasmid, but have not yet demonstrated such a plasmid in the
isolates described. If they are correct, we will undoubtedly see many more
reports of emergence of ESBLs among nosocomial isolates around the globe.
Thanks to Hakan Leblebicioglu for calling this study to our attention. -
