Malaria in Spain before eradication
-----------------------------------
The following background data are abstracted from references 1 and 2,
listed below.

Malaria was extremely common in Spain during the 1st decades of the
twentieth century, with 293 000 cases and 1278 deaths reported during
the late 1930's to early 1940's. The last confirmed indigenous cases
were reported during the 1950's, and Spain was certified malaria-free
by the World Health Organization (WHO) in September 1964.

Introduced malaria:
-------------------
1978: A case of introduced malaria was reported (a nurse who had been
in contact with a malaria patient).
1984: An outbreak of 4 cases was reported among injecting drug users
in Madrid in 1984. A similar outbreak (2 IDU in Cataluna) was reported in 1986.
1987: A case of transfusion-related malaria was reported in Valencia.
1991: An outbreak (43 cases from transfused blood and 11 from plasma)
of introduced malaria was reported.
1998: Spain's last case of introduced malaria (from Mauritania) was
reported in the Canary Islands in 1998.

Prevalence surveys:
-------------------
3.8 percent of asymptomatic immigrants referred to a tropical medical
unit (Madrid, 1989 to 2008)

Vectors:
--------
The local potential vectors are _Anopheles atroparvus_ (throughout)
and _An. messeae_ (in the north). _An. labranchiae_, once a common
vector, is no longer found in Spain.

[ProMED thanks Steve Berger for the comments. The prevalence of
malaria in asymptomatic immigrants underlines the risk of secondary
cases if a suitable Anopheles vector is present and the climatic
conditions allow the development cycle in the mosquito. - Mod. EP]
