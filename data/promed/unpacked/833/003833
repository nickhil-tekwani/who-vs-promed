Outbreak of lethal superbug at 2nd hospital kills 23
----------------------------------------------------
A lethal new strain of _Clostridium difficile_ has infected a 2nd hospital
in Britain, raising fears that it is spreading throughout the National
Health Service. The outbreak of _C. difficile_ infection at the Royal Devon
and Exeter Foundation NHS Trust infected 265 patients in the first 5 months
of 2005 and has caused 23 deaths since January. The number of patients
stricken with the virulent infection, which causes severe diarrhea, is
running at twice the level seen in 2004, when 254 patients at the 850 bed
hospital were infected over 12 months.
The new strain of the bug, which produces 20 times more toxin than the
ordinary strain, was also the cause of an outbreak at Stoke Mandeville
hospital in Buckinghamshire, revealed by The Independent. More than 300
patients have been infected and 12 have died at the hospital since the end
of 2003.
The latest outbreak will raise new concerns about standards of cleanliness
and pressure on hospitals to meet government waiting time targets. Doctors
and health service managers have complained that bed occupancy levels are
too high to allow proper hygiene precautions to be taken.
Cases of _C. difficile_ infection rose sharply at the Royal Devon and
Exeter and peaked in Jan 2005. Staff suspected something unusual was behind
the rise and sent specimens for analysis that revealed infection with the
lethal new 027 strain [PCR ribotype O27 - Mod.LL].
Public health specialists have identified 15 patients out of 18 tested at
the Royal Devon and Exeter hospital infected with the new strain.
Brian Duerden, the chief inspector of microbiology and hospital infection
at the Department of Health, said: "I am concerned we have got a new strain
that is more virulent. There have been some isolated cases but we don't
know of other clusters. We need to do more work on how it is spread."
Professor Duerden said the new strain was similar to one causing problems
in Quebec and the USA, where there have been hundreds of cases and
associated deaths. "But we have no idea how they are related or how the
infection has been transmitted [to Britain]. We will be looking at all
aspects of this and will re-emphasise existing guidance."

[Publications regarding _C. difficile_ have increased recently and have
been concerned primarily with 2 issues: the increased virulence of the
hyperproducer of toxin strains as reported above and the apparent
decreasing efficacy of metronidazole as a therapeutic modality. - Mod.LL]
