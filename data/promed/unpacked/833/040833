Forty of 230 infected people have died from a hemorrhagic fever in eastern
Cameroon since last December, according to Cameroon national television.
The epidemic appears to be centered in the Ngoela region of eastern Cameroon.
The provincial health officer, Dr Levis Mpiouang, confirmed the casualty
figures but emphasized that the disease was not Ebola which has frequently
broken out in central African countries and for which there is no known
cure. He said the disease is characterized by a bloody diarrhea and slight
fever.

[This could be cholera or any of a number of other infectious diseases or
could be a non-infectious event. If anyone has additional data, please let
us know. A couple of clarifications and comments: Ebola has NOT
"frequently broken out" anywhere and has not been detected in Cameroon.
The low mortality rate alone would make such a diagnosis unlikely anyway.
On the other hand, laboratory diagnostic tests are required before anyone
can make any reasonable statement about etiology. It would be informative
to know whether specimens have been sent to a reference center. - Mod.CHC]
