The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health is today [25 May 2022] investigating a suspected case of food poisoning related to the consumption of wild mushrooms, and urged the public not to pick and eat wild mushrooms.

The case involves 2 females aged 36 and 61, who developed abdominal pain, diarrhoea, nausea, and vomiting about 2.5 hours after consuming mushrooms at home on [24 May 2022]. They sought medical attention at the Accident and Emergency Department of North Lantau Hospital on the same day and were admitted for further management. They have been in stable condition.

Initial investigations revealed the patients picked the wild mushrooms they consumed from a hillside somewhere in Tung Chung on [24 May 2022]. The CHP's investigation is ongoing.

"Members of the public should not pick wild mushrooms for consumption as it is difficult to distinguish edible mushroom species from inedible ones," a spokesman for the CHP said.

"Mushroom poisoning is generally acute. Common presentations include gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain appearing shortly after ingestion. Depending on the mushroom species, patients may also have other symptoms such as profuse sweating, hallucinations, coma or other neurological symptoms, as well as liver failure. Death may result in severe cases," he added.

"If mushroom poisoning is suspected, the patient should seek immediate medical attention and bring along any available remnant for identification," the spokesman said.

[There are limited clinical signs noted here so it is difficult to speculate on the type of mushroom which may have been ingested.

There are a number of toxic mushrooms in every country. Mushroom identification can be difficult, requiring a trained mycologist to distinguish the very minor differences in some cases between the toxic fungi and the non-toxic fungi. - Mod.TG
