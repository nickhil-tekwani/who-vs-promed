We have confirmed another anthrax outbreak. The partido of General
Lamadrid got a hard rain (120 mm) following a drought that affected
the whole Province of Buenos Aires. This farm had an outbreak in 2004
in the same field [as the present cases]. There are 150 unvaccinated
female calves weighing, on average, 120 kg.
So far, 2 animals have died suddenly. They showed bloody discharges
from their nostrils and anus. The animals had been skinned and moved
to another place to be burned. The veterinarian that performed the
necropsy reported seeing splenomegaly and hemorrhagic enteritis.
The farm is located in the Partido de La Madrid, paraje of Pontaut in
Buenos Aires Province.

[I apologize for the delay in posting this, but I wanted a
translation by an Argentine colleague to make sure I did not get it
wrong. This is relatively early in the southern hemisphere summer for
such cases, so I suspect that the Argentine incidence will increase
markedly as summer progresses. - Mod.MHJ]
