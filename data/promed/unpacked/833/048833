Fourteen cutaneous anthrax cases have been confirmed in northeast China's Heilongjiang Province, local authorities said on Fri 10 Aug 2018. One of the 14 patients was cured and discharged from hospital, the information office of the provincial government told a press briefing. The epidemic is under control, and the patients have been under effective treatment, it said.

Local authorities are examining the pathogens. A total of 818 sheep in the affected and high-risk areas in Huanan and Yilan counties have been culled.

Cutaneous, or skin, anthrax is the least serious form of the disease. It is usually contracted when a person with a cut or sore on their skin comes into direct, unprotected contact with anthrax spores on a sick or dead animal.

The Heilongjiang Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Bureau has sent 3 expert teams to handle the situation. Meanwhile, it has sent 112 500 ml of anthrax vaccine to immunize livestock in the 2 counties.

The provincial health authorities also have sent experts to investigate the infections in a bid to roll out more effective control and prevention measures.

[Reading between the lines, "anthrax" was confirmed so far just on the basis of the human cutaneous lesion(s). Culturing human cases is very difficult because of the speed with which antibiotics get purchased, usually a day or so before samples get taken. By then, all organisms will be dead. And even if antibiotics have not been used, according to my colleague Benyamin Cherrkaskii, based on his experience in Soviet Russia, only 30% can be cultured. The best way to sample suspected cutaneous anthrax lesions is get a hypodermic and draw up some bloody fluid from underneath the lesion; it should contain viable spores and toxins.

At this point, we must still await veterinary confirmation. - Mod.MHJ
