Summary of outbreaks:
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1: Lac des Merveilles, Alpes-Maritimes
Date of start of the outbreak: 15 Aug 2012

Epidemiological unit: lake
Water type: fresh water
Population type: wild
Population system: open
Affected animals:
Species / Morbidity / Mortality / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Common frog (_Rana temporaria_) / 2 (scale 0 to 5) / 2 (scale 0 to 5) / / / 100 / /

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive.
Epidemiological comment: This event took place in August 2012 in 4 lakes among the several glacial lakes in Mercantour Park (Lac des Merveilles is one of the affected lakes, the largest of the 4 lakes). Agents from ONEMA (French National Agency for Water and Aquatic Environments) and from the Mercantour National Park observed this confined and mild phenomenon of mortalities during their round and took some samples. Investigations were aimed first at usual known pathogens (that is chytrid fungus) and tests were conducted for _Ranavirus_ (known to be widespread in Europe). The presence of viruses of the [genus] _Ranavirus_ was detected on all the batches. Following this, sequencing was performed at the University of Savoie (CNRS) in December 2012 and was confirmed at the University of Ghent in Belgium in January 2013; the strain is identical to that isolated in newts in 2008 in Spain (common midwife toad ranavirus). In order to be able to establish a link between the causal agent (_Ranavirus_) and the disease (ranavirosis), an experimental infection protocol was developed. These tests were conducted in 2013 in the Jura Veterinary Analysis Laboratory (LVD39) and showed in autumn 2013 that the isolated _Ranavirus_ was pathogen and responsible for mortalities in common frogs observed in the lakes investigated in Mercantour Park. The LVD39 sent this information in November 2013 to the OIE Reference Laboratory for amphibians, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO), in Australia.

[Ranaviruses are a group of pathogens belonging to the genus _Ranavirus_ (Family Iridoviridae) that have been linked to catastrophic die-offs of larval amphibians in many parts of the world. In the United States, ranaviruses are responsible for the majority of disease-related mortality events in amphibians.

This virus became an emerging infectious disease possibly due to a novel strain introduction or increased occurrence of anthropogenic stressors on the landscape. A few years ago, the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) listed this pathogen as a notiÔ¨Åable disease.
