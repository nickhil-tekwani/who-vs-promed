Measles outbreak: Rockland nears 200 cases (Centers for Disease Control)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
There were 194 confirmed cases of measles in Rockland county as of 19 Apr 2019, health officials said.

Unvaccinated children continue to be the most vulnerable population -- 4 out of 5 people who have been infected with the virus since the outbreak started in October [2018].

Vaccination rates for confirmed measles cases in Rockland county as of 18 Apr 2019:
- 80.8% have had 0 MMRs [measles, mumps, rubella]
- 5.2% have had 1 MMR
-3.1% have had 2 MMRs
- 10.9% unknown status

Age groups for the confirmed measles cases in Rockland county as of 18 Apr 2019:
- Less than 1 year old: 14.0%
- 1-3 years: 28.0%
- 4-6 years: 15.0%
- 7-18 years: 26.9%
- 19+ years: 16.1%

Officials have said they are worried that the outbreak will spread even further during the spring holidays.

Rockland county is tracking every case and all exposed or infected people must stay out of indoor and outdoor public places.

New York City declared a public health emergency and the city's health department has already closed down one Orthodox Jewish school for not complying with vaccination orders.

New York City reported 359 cases as of 18 Apr 2019 in Brooklyn and Queens.
Orange county reported 20 cases in its outbreak 19 Apr 2019.
Westchester county confirmed 8 cases on 10 Apr 2019, most of whom were children exposed in either Rockland or Brooklyn.

2018-2019 Measles outbreak in Rockland county: as of 19 Apr 2019, there are 194 confirmed reported cases of measles in Rockland county.

At the end of September 2018, an international traveler arrived in Rockland county with a suspected case of the measles. Per protocol, the Rockland County Department of Health (RCDOH) was notified and immediately activated its Communicable Disease Team to investigate. There have been additional cases of measles from international travelers to Rockland, exposing more people to measles. People who are unvaccinated risk getting infected with measles and spreading it to others.

These cases are presently clustered in eastern Ramapo (New Square, Spring Valley, Monsey), however due to Rockland county's small geographic size, exposure to the measles may occur anywhere in the county.

Since measles is highly contagious, the Health Department, with additional support from the New York State Department of Health and local partners, is working to limit exposures and offer free vaccine to boost the county's immunization rate and protect its residents from the harmful effects of the measles virus.

The RCDOH, Refuah Health Center, and private pediatricians and family doctors have administered over 18 000 doses of MMR vaccine.

Recent outbreak in Brooklyn and Queens
--------------------------------------
As of 18 Apr 2019, there have been 359 confirmed cases of measles in Brooklyn and Queens since October [2018]. Most of these cases have involved members of the Orthodox Jewish community.

The initial child with measles was unvaccinated and acquired measles on a visit to Israel, where a large outbreak of the disease is occurring. Since then, there have been additional people from Brooklyn and Queens who were unvaccinated and acquired measles while in Israel. People who did not travel were also infected in Brooklyn or Rockland county.

Vaccination requirement in Brooklyn
-----------------------------------
On 9 Apr 2019, the Health Commissioner ordered every adult and child who lives, works or resides in [4] ZIP codes and has not received the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine to be vaccinated (PDF)
(https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/press/2019/emergency-orders-measles)

On 17 Apr 2019, the Board of Health voted unanimously to adopt a resolution supporting the Commissioner's order and the vaccination requirement (PDF).
(https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/notice/2019/board-of-health-resolution-measles.pdf)

People who demonstrate they are immune from measles or have a medical condition that prevents them from receiving the vaccine will not need to get vaccinated.

If the Health Department identifies a person with measles or an unvaccinated child exposed to measles in one of the above ZIP codes, that individual or their parent or guardian could be fined USD 1000.

Los Angeles county health officials said [Thu 18 Apr 2019] they have confirmed a 4th case of measles involving someone who traveled through the county.

This case centered around a passenger who flew in and out of Los Angeles International Airport, the 3rd such incident at LAX in the past 2 months. The passenger arrived at and departed from the airport on 3 Apr 2019, according to a statement from the Department of Public Health.

There is no known current risk related to measles that exists at any of these venues at this time, health officials said.

"Although LA county is not experiencing an outbreak, measles outbreaks are occurring nationally and internationally and exposures related to travel can occur," said Dr Muntu Davis, the county's health officer. "This underscores the importance for those who are not immunized against measles to get the measles immunization."

People who were on the flights have been contacted and those who are symptom-free after 24 Apr 2019 are no longer at risk.

Two previous measles cases involved passengers who passed through LAX.

Vaccine protection

[6] Uncertainty
Date: Sat 20 Apr 2019 6:59 ET
Source: CNN [abridged, edited]
https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/19/health/measles-vaccine-protection-age/index.html


Nearly 2 decades after measles was declared eliminated in the United States, the country and the globe have seen an upsurge of cases -- including adults who thought they were protected by the vaccine. Now, some are questioning whether they are properly vaccinated and whether they are still at risk for getting measles.

In a video posted to YouTube last week, a rabbi in Detroit who said he was "fully vaccinated" nevertheless came down with measles -- "a brutal 3 weeks," he said. In another recent case, an Israeli flight attendant has been unable to breathe on her own after experiencing a dire complication of measles: inflammation and swelling of the brain, called encephalitis. Health authorities believe she also received a vaccine.

"It's just so darn contagious. And the way that people travel nowadays, it just doesn't really take much for it to spread," said Dr John Cullen, the current president of the American Academy of Family Physicians and a family physician in Valdez, Alaska. "I have never seen a case of measles," he added. "But it's just a matter of time."

Adding to the uncertainty, some adults simply don't know their vaccination status or have long lost their documentation, Cullen said. The history of the measles vaccine has also prompted questions about how people of different ages have been vaccinated: not only has the recommended number of doses changed over the years, but so has the vaccine itself.

Several years ago, he recalled, a case of measles popped up in Fairbanks, Alaska -- the state's 1st case in years. Worried about having been exposed and uncertain about whether they were properly vaccinated, patients of his who had traveled there asked for a dose of the vaccine, just in case. (When given within 3 days of exposure to the virus, the vaccine may offer some protection or make the illness milder, according to health officials.)

Although Alaska hasn't seen any cases this year [2019], health officials issued an alert following a declaration of emergency in nearby Washington state, which has confirmed dozens of cases in 2019.

"If we see a substantial increase in the number of infections of measles, then there's going to be a whole lot more people who are going to be wondering what their vaccine status is," he said.

What are the current measles vaccine recommendations?
-----------------------------------------------------
Doctors recommend 2 doses of the MMR vaccine, so called because it covers measles, mumps and rubella. Doctors give the 1st dose between 12 and 15 months, the 2nd between 4 to 6 years.

The current recommendation was issued in 1989 by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Prior to that, a single-dose recommendation had been in place from 1963.

Before we had a vaccine, the agency says 3 million to 4 million Americans were infected yearly, including 48 000 hospitalizations and 400-500 deaths.

In some recent years, there have been fewer than 100 cases nationwide. But the virus has made a comeback in other years, including 2019 -- largely due to anti-vaxers, experts say.

"The reason why we have vaccine hesitancy in this country is because people don't remember how bad it was," Cullen said.

Which vaccine did I get?
------------------------
If you were born before the 1960s, you may have never been vaccinated against measles because it was assumed you'd been exposed to the virus. In fact, the CDC says that most people born before 1957 don't need the vaccine because "before vaccines were available, nearly everyone was infected with measles, mumps, and rubella viruses during childhood."

Then, in 1963, 2 types of measles vaccines were introduced: One was "killed" and another "live attenuated." The difference is that the first inactivates the measles virus, whereas the other has a weakened form of it.

The killed vaccine, which was given to an estimated 600 000 to 900 000 people, was itself killed off in 1967 "because it did not protect against measles virus infection," the CDC says. The agency also recommended that people who got that vaccine, or aren't sure of which one they got during those years, should get vaccinated anew.

The following year, in 1968, a new version of the live vaccine hit the market. It was just as effective as its live-attenuated predecessor and even safer than the first, as it had been further weakened. It's still used today, and has been available in combination with the mumps and rubella vaccines since 1971.

Experts say many middle-aged adults who were vaccinated in the early days won't know which one they got. Whether one received the "live" or "killed" vaccine was not always documented, Schaffner said -- and these days, those decades-old records might be nowhere to be found. "Back then, the entire profession was not as nuanced about giving vaccines," he said.

What's more, neither the CDC nor any national organization has kept vaccination records. Individual states have immunization registries, but those didn't come along until later. For many Americans, "the records that exist are the ones you or your parents were given when the vaccines were administered and the ones in the medical record of the doctor or clinic where the vaccines were given," according to the CDC, which recommends that people search among baby books, school records, and previous employers that may have collected this information, such as the military.

But many adults will be out of luck. Older records "simply don't exist anymore because the doctors closed their practice, they retired, they moved away," Schaffner said. "It would be nigh on impossible to actually resurrect those records."

[8] Jewish nurses advocate for vaccination
Date: Sun 21 Apr 2019 10:30 AM EDT
Source: CNBC [abridged, edited]
https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/18/jewish-nurses-debunk-anti-vaxxer-misinformation-as-measles-spreads.html


- The Orthodox Jewish Nurses' Vaccine Task Force is trying to combat misinformation about the measles vaccine as an outbreak spreads in some Hasidic neighborhoods [in New York City].
- The group is fighting what city officials have identified as anti-vaxxing propaganda handbook.
- It was written by an anonymous group that calls itself Peach -- Parents Educating and Advocating for Children's Health.

[An emergency room nurse practitioner] and 14 other Orthodox Jewish nurses are going line by line through a 40-page handbook that New York City health officials have identified as propaganda that's helping to fuel a measles outbreak in the region. Written by an anonymous group that calls itself Peach -- Parents Educating and Advocating for Children's Health -- the document laces largely unproven anti-vaccination theories with passages from Jewish religious texts [see Measles update (26) 20190414.6422351].

With the outbreak sickening more than 300 people in the city since October [2018], Mayor Bill de Blasio declared a public health emergency under which people who don't get their children vaccinated face fines. With the start of Passover this past weekend [20 Apr 2019], the risk of spreading measles increases as families gather for the 8-day holiday.

[The nurse], who is on maternity leave, said she has personally been putting in more than 4 hours a day debunking misinformation in the booklet, which is being passed around in ultra-Orthodox Jewish communities in two Brooklyn neighborhoods.

She said Peach has waged a "pretty good propaganda effort" in the Williamsburg and Borough Park neighborhoods of Brooklyn. As of [Mon 15 Apr 2019], the city has confirmed 329 cases of measles, including 44 in the previous week. Health officials expect that number to rise as some parents refuse to vaccinate their children.

The authors and financing behind Peach have remained mostly anonymous, with several participants going by pseudonyms. Emailed requests for comments from CNBC were not returned.

Peach's booklet has been circulating for about 2 years and touts common anti-vaxx beliefs that have been circulating for about a decade, said Dr Jane Zucker, the city health department's assistant commissioner for immunization.

The booklet takes original, anti-vaccination beliefs and applies them to passages of the Bible. It also includes letters signed by some rabbis decrying vaccination as well as "cherry picked" and outdated research, [the nurse] said. The group also runs its own anti-vaccination hotline for parents to call and listen to a recording that plays up fears that the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine causes autism, a theory that's been thoroughly debunked by medical doctors.

[The emergency room nurse] and her fellow nurses, members of the Orthodox Jewish Nurses' Vaccine Task Force, are frantically working on their own handbook called Pie, short for Parents Informed and Educated. They're going page-by-page against Peach, seeking to refute its claims by providing full explanations of information the nurses say has been misconstrued and denouncing some of its information with data and research from reputable institutions.

The Vaccine Safety Handbook from Peach was mailed and hand delivered to homes around Brooklyn, she added, "putting [misinformation] directly in the hands of a vulnerable population."

"One of the main things that we can provide that sets us apart, as nurses, we are trained to educate our patients," [the nurse] said. The women are taking scientific literature and research studies and translating it into layman's terms for ultra-Orthodox Jewish parents. Rather than dismiss their concerns, they cite studies and data that back up their points.
