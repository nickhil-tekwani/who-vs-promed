Agricultural experts have found anthrax in central Sweden after a heifer did not stop bleeding after death, the 2nd such case in the area in 2 years. The bacteria can spread from cow to human.

The dead cow was found on a farm in Orebro [county], central Sweden. The area was promptly cordoned off as the cadaver kept on bleeding. Blood that fails to coagulate is a typical clinical sign of the disease, Katharina Gielen, spokeswoman at the Swedish Agriculture Board (Jordbruksverket), told The Local.

"There's no indication as to why this cow had anthrax and we don't know where the bacteria came from," she said. "But there is nothing to indicate that there will be more cases."

So far, no one who has been in contact with the cow has contracted the disease.

The cow was found near an area where Sweden's last reported case of anthrax was reported in July 2011, but the agriculture board did not believe there was a connection. Over 50 other cattle nearby will be vaccinated on Saturday [2 Nov 2013].

Anthrax, a bacterial disease that can be passed between animals and humans, is extremely potent and can live for 100 years; however, no one has died in Sweden from anthrax since 1965.

The disease is most commonly contracted by herbivorous animals that are grazing and inhaling spores from infected environments. It can be found worldwide, but not often in Sweden. Before 2011, the most recent reported case was in 2008 -- prior to that, no case had been discovered since 1981.

Humans can be infected if they have close contact with animals that are dying of the disease, or have died, but it is extremely uncommon, especially in Sweden.

"Humans aren't that susceptible to catching anthrax from animals; there hasn't been a case for a long, long time," Gielen told The Local.

[The persistence of outbreaks in this part of Orebro would suggest that there is or are an old anthrax grave or graves thereabouts. Those involved were very fortunate that they had an extravasating carcass. In my experience, and in spite of what is in the textbooks, extravasation is the exception, not the rule. Usually the amount of blood from natural openings is minimal if there is any at all. But when it occurs, it ensures that ground contamination occurs. It would be wise if the veterinary authorities checked the farm records for unexpected sudden deaths on the affected farms and found out what was done with the carcass.

The Swedes are normally conservative about vaccinating; see ProMED-mail post 20110808.2406. They would be wise to vaccinate this and the neighbouring herds for a minimum of 3 years, optimally 5 years. The Israeli experience has been to do it for 10 years, and this resulted in no more outbreaks in subsequent years. - Mod.MHJ
