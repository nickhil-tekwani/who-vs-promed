QURGHONTEPPA: An examination has revealed that 293 of the 93 182 sheep and
goats and 21 of the 30 885 cattle (in the southern Khatlon Region) have
brucellosis. The figures account for 3 per cent of the total number of
cattle in the region, Asia-Plus learned from the chief physician of the
regional veterinary laboratory, Huseynboy Hisoriyev. The international
organization Merlin and the republic's veterinary laboratory provided the
Khatlon veterinary laboratory with diagnostic preparations to conduct the
examination.
Hisoriyev said that there had also been 2 cases of anthrax. Thus, 57 cases
of anthrax have been logged in the first 5 months of 2001. [This is 20
cases up from the same period last year.
The head of the regional sanitary and epidemiological station, Azizullo
Sharipov, said that 5 people had contracted anthrax in the first 5 months
of 2000, whereas 16 anthrax patients already have been registered this
year. A total of 24 people contracted brucellosis between January and May
2000, while the corresponding figure this year was 91.

[The "brucellosis" among livestock could be either abortions or reactors to
serological screening. Without prior knowledge, it is impossible to
determine which. If they are seroprevalence data, the rates are very good,
but they would not match the human incidence figures, which indicate a much
higher exposure rate. Both _Br. melitensis_ and _Br. abortus_ exist in this
region. Previous postings from this area indicate that southern Tajikistan
can also reflect epidemiologic conditions in northern Afghanistan. - Mod.MHJ
