KYASANUR FOREST DISEASE - INDIA (03): BACKGROUND

KFD was first described in 1957 in the Kyasanur Forest of Karnataka State of
India. The causative agent is Kyasanur Forest disease virus (KFDV). KFDV is a
tickborne virus (genus: _Flavivirus_, family: _Flaviviridae_). Human infection
of KFDV has occurred frequently among forest workers with a mortality reaching
10 per cent. Outbreaks of KFDV infection occur in the dry season as its tick
vector (_Haemaphysalis spinigera_) is most active and anthropophilic [human-
biting]. The normal hosts for the virus are local rodents, cattle and monkeys.
Epidemics of KFD were controlled to a great extent after successful
development of a formalin-inactivated vaccine produced in chick embryo
fibroblasts. The places [where vaccination will be carried out] are selected
on the basis of prevalence of KFDV activity in the previous years, including
the villages [where] monkey deaths were reported and those adjacent to the
KFDV-affected areas. The efficacy of the vaccine was satisfactory, exerting a
highly significant protective effect. Coverage of vaccine is fairly good.
Almost all individuals including children are being routinely vaccinated by
local government authorities.
However, recent data on the incidence of KFD cases from 5 districts
of Karnataka state, namely Shimoga, Udupi, Mangalore, Chickmangalore
and Uttar Kannada suggest that the number of cases has increased in
the last 5 years. Total KFD cases: 85 in 1999, 130 in 2000, 435 in
2001, 625 in 2002, 920 in 2003, and 606 in 2004. In the month of
January 2005 a total of 21 cases with 4 deaths were recorded.
Increased KFD cases despite routine vaccination suggests insufficient
efficacy of the current vaccine protocol. However, the exact cause of
the increase in KFD cases needs further investigation.
The increasing trend of KFD cases in Karnataka state warrants development
of a new vaccine preparation that includes currently circulating
KFDV. Improper storage of vaccine and lack of maintenance of the cold
chain result in inactivation of the vaccine and could be another
reason for the emergence of KFD despite routine vaccination. Until now no
quick diagnostic kit has been available for early diagnosis of KFD.
Most of the cases are confirmed based on syndromic diagnosis, the HI,
immunofluorescence, and neutralization tests. Considering the
requirement of safer and more effective vaccines in general, there is
clearly a need for developing an alternative vaccine as well as a
rapid diagnostic system for KFD.
