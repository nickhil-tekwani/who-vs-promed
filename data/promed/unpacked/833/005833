Army reports 2 new severe pneumonia cases
-----------------------------------
The Army Surgeon General said Mon 18 Aug 2003 that the number of cases of
serious pneumonia reported since 1 Mar 2003 among USA service members has
risen to 18, up from 16 since the last report 10 days ago. 2 of the
patients have died. Their deaths are being investigated, said Lyn Kukral, a
public affairs officer with the office of the Army Surgeon General.
No infectious agent common to the 18 cases has been found, she said, and
there is no evidence that exposure to chemical or biological weapons,
severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS], or environmental toxins caused any
of the cases. All 18 patients -- 17 men and a woman -- were placed on
ventilators. The cases were geographically dispersed, and the afflicted
serve in different units.
12 of the cases have occurred in Iraq, 3 in Kuwait, and 1 each in Qatar,
Uzbekistan, and Djibouti. The patients range in age from 19-47, with a
median age of 24. 2 cases occurred in March, 2 in April, 1 in May, 6 in
June, 4 in July, and 3 in August [2003].
Several weeks ago, the Army activated 2 medical teams to investigate the
cases. One team went to Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, Germany, where
most of the patients were treated after medical evacuation. The other team
is working with medical personnel in Iraq. The teams are reviewing patient
records and laboratory results, and questioning health care providers and
patients. In Iraq, the team is sampling soil, water, and air to examine
whether those factors might have played a part. The case review is being
carried out in collaboration with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention [CDC].
Army-wide, pneumonia serious enough to warrant hospitalization occurs in
about 400-500 soldiers per year, Kukral said. Based on that, the
approximately 100 total cases of pneumonia in the Central Command area of
operations since 1 Mar 2003 do not exceed expectations, she added. She did
not have figures about how many cases typically require ventilators. From
1998 through 2002, 17 soldiers have died from pneumonia or from complications
of pneumonia, she said.

[Although several new cases have occurred, there are still no direct data
linking the etiology -- or more likely etiologies -- of the cases, which
are spread out over time and geography. No information has yet been
forthcoming on studies from any surgical or postmortem lung specimens. -
