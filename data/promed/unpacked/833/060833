Possible citrus canker outbreak in Frostproof, Florida
---------------------------------------
A possible citrus canker (CC) outbreak has been found in young trees taken
from a nursery in what may be the 1st case of the disease in citrus-rich
Polk County since a 10-year-old outbreak originated in the Miami area.
Workers with the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services
have taken samples for testing from a 14-acre nursery in Frostproof owned
by Ben Hill Griffin Inc., one of the state's largest growers. "All the
indications are we're dealing with citrus canker," said Richard Gaskalla,
executive director of the department's Division of Plant Industry.
State officials are tracing all trees that left the nursery during the past
several months. Polk County, with 11 million trees, is the largest
citrus-producing county in Florida.

[If confirmed, this could be a serious problem for disease management
specialists. Whenever a nursery is contaminated with citrus canker (CC),
this necessarily requires immediate trace-backs on movement of all affected
nursery stocks. CC is caused by the bacterium _Xanthomonas axonopodis_ pv.
_citri_ (Xac). It is an introduced plant disease, the eradication of which
has received considerable press attention and legal challenges. CC has
produced far-reaching political and socioeconomic impact in Florida, and
has implications for national and international trade . Xac infection
causes leaf, stem, and fruit-blemishing directly that reduces fruit quality
and quantity. Presence of Xac, if detected, triggers immediate quarantines
of areas with outbreaks in Florida, disrupting movement of fresh fruit.
Disease management depends upon use of integrated management programs,
exclusion/sanitation procedures, selection of pathogen-free citrus budwood
with field resistance to CC, cultural control and use of preventive sprays
of copper-based bactericides.
I have listed just one reference here; use "citrus canker" to get all CC
pieces.
