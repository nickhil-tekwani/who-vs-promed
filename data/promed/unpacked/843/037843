The Minister for Indigenous Peoples, Nicia Maldonado, stated that
recently 6 children of the Warao ethnic group have died, victims of a
virus, in Bolivar state. The results of laboratory tests in Caracas to
identify the virus are awaited.

The children presented "an infectious clinical picture and samples
taken were sent to Caracas to determine which virus" caused the
deaths, Maldonado explained for 'Venezolana de Television' from one of
the Warao communities in Bolivar, in the south of Venezuela.

The minister said that one of the children was never taken to a
hospital, while the other 2 were taken to a medical center, but were
not hospitalized.
