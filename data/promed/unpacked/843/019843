Pomegranates in Maharashtra have been affected by bacterial blight (oily spot) disease this [2018] season, causing damage to the fruit's quality by nearly 50 per cent. As a result, modal prices have dropped, said [the] chairman, Maharashtra Pomegranate Growers Research Association. "The oily spot has been caused by the incessant rains in the state," he said.

The area under pomegranates has increased [in the state] which has led to an increase in production, but the quality has been affected by bacterial blight. The size of the fruit has been affected and the black spots on the fruit have also led to a dip in quality. This [2018] season is not considered conducive for export.

[Oily spot of pomegranate (also called bacterial blight, black spot) is caused by the bacterium _Xanthomonas axonopodis_ (Xa) pv. _punicae_. The disease was first described in India in 1952 and was only known from that country, until it was recently reported also from South Africa. The main damage occurs on fruits which develop black spots and usually split resulting in enormous yield losses. Disease development and spread are favoured by cloudy weather and intermittent rainfall, and heavy rains are thought to be a triggering factor for epidemics.

The pathogen is spread by infected plant material (including fruit, twigs and cuttings), mechanical means (including insect and human activities) and wind-splashed rain. Disease management may include use of clean planting material, phytosanitary measures and bactericidal sprays containing antibiotics or copper. However, the latter may lead to rejection of exported fruit by some countries (such as within the European Union). No commercial pomegranate cultivar has been found to show any resistance to oily spot.

The disease has become an increasingly serious problem for Indian pomegranate growers in several states (see previous ProMED-mail posts below). In Maharashtra, it is the main disease of the crop with 100 per cent infection in some orchards. In Karnataka, it is considered an epidemic and a threat to the industry with up to 85 per cent incidence in the north.

Other pathovars of Xa affect a range of crops, for example: pv.s _citri_ and _aurantifolii_ cause citrus canker which poses a serious threat to citrus industries worldwide; pv. _allii_ causes bacterial blight of onion, a serious disease emerging in several tropical and subtropical areas; pv. _vesicatoria_ causes bacterial spot of tomato and capsicum.
