Outbreaks of _Salmonella_ Infections Linked to Backyard Poultry
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Investigation details:
Since the last update on 20 May 2020, 368 more ill people and 6 additional _Salmonella_ serotypes (Agona, Anatum, Enteritidis, Infantis, Mbandaka, and I 4,[5], 12:i:-) were added to this investigation.

As of 23 Jun 2020, a total of 465 people infected with one of the outbreak strains of _Salmonella_ have been reported from 42 states.

Total / 465

Illnesses started on dates from 14 Jan 2020 to 1 Jun 2020. Ill people range in age from less than 1 year to 88 years, with a median age of 31; 56% are female. Of 241 people with information available, 86 (36%) have been hospitalized. One death in Oklahoma has been reported.

If antimicrobials are needed, some infections related to these outbreaks may be difficult to treat with some commonly recommended antibacterials and may require a different therapeutic choice. Whole genome sequencing performed on 225 samples of _Salmonella_ bacteria isolated from ill people predicted antimicrobial resistance to one or more of the following antibacterials: amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (2.2%), ampicillin (3.4%), cefoxitin (2.2%), ceftriaxone (2.2%), chloramphenicol (0.4%), fosfomycin (5.2%), gentamicin (0.7%), streptomycin (75.7%), sulfisoxazole (2.2%), tetracycline (76.4%), and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (1.1%). There was no resistance predicted for 42 (15.7%) isolates. Testing of 4 outbreak isolates using standard antimicrobial susceptibility testing by CDC's National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) laboratory confirmed these results (fosfomycin was not tested by this method).

Investigation of the outbreaks:
Epidemiologic evidence shows that contact with backyard poultry (such as chicks and ducklings) is the likely source of these outbreaks. In interviews, ill people answered questions about animal contact in the week before they became ill. Of 226 people interviewed, 179 (79%) reported contact with chicks and ducklings before becoming ill. Ill people reported buying poultry from various sources, including agricultural stores, websites, and hatcheries. Regardless of where poultry are purchased, they can carry _Salmonella_ that can make people sick. Backyard poultry owners should always follow steps to stay healthy around their flocks.

This investigation is ongoing, and CDC will provide updates when more information becomes available.
