The Agriculture and Farming Service (SAG, according to its Spanish initials) in Chile, detected the presence of some cattle with positive serology tests for _Brucella abortus_, the causative agent of bovine brucellosis, during a surveillance control performed in 3 farms on the border with Argentina, in Ultima Esperanza Province (Magellan and Chilean Antarctica region).

In the face of this situation, SAG for the Magallanes Region decreed sanitation measures in the affected farms, consisting in vaccinating and taking samples of every susceptible animal, restricting the movement of animals, and identifying and slaughtering the [affected] animals.

In addition, according to Polar radio station, samples will be taken from animals in neighboring and related farms, surveillance will be maintained in the border farms, and 100 percent of susceptible animals brought to slaughterhouses will be tested.

For his part, Mr Gerardo Otzen, Regional Director of SAG for the Magallanes Region, mentioned that "given the importance of this disease and its economical consequences, the service has implemented emergency measures, establishing working teams dedicated primarily to investigating the route by which the disease was introduced into this region, which might have been by contact with or introduction of animals from Argentina, given that no cattle has entered the northern region of Chile during the past 10 years."

"Every effort is being made to prevent the spread of this disease. We believe that the measures implemented, such as placing the farms under quarantine and restricting the movement of animals, will allow us to rapidly recover our status of brucellosis-free region," he added.

Bovine brucellosis is a communicable disease of cattle. It leads to frequent miscarriage events when the disease strikes for the 1st time. It may also lead to the production of weak offspring, causing important economical losses, and it may also become a public health problem.

Brucellosis, in cattle, water buffalo, and bison is caused almost exclusively by _Brucella abortus_; however, _B. suis_ or _B. melitensis_ are occasionally implicated in some cattle herds. _B. suis_ does not appear to be contagious from cow to cow. Infection spreads rapidly and causes many abortions in unvaccinated cattle. In a herd in which the disease is endemic, an infected cow typically aborts only once after exposure; subsequent gestations and lactations appear normal. After exposure, cattle become bacteremic for a short period and develop agglutinins and other antibodies; some resist infection and a small percentage of infected cows recover. A positive serum agglutination test usually precedes an abortion or a normal parturition but may be delayed in about 15 percent of cows. The incubation period may be variable and is inversely related to stage of gestation at time of exposure. Organisms are shed in milk and uterine discharges, and the cow may become temporarily infertile. Bacteria may be found in the uterus during pregnancy, uterine involution, and infrequently, for a prolonged time, in the non-gravid uterus. Shedding from the vagina largely disappears with the decrease of fluids following parturition. Some infected cows that previously aborted shed brucellae from the uterus at subsequent normal parturitions. Organisms are shed in milk for a variable length of time -- in most cattle for life.

Natural transmission occurs by ingestion of organisms, which are present in large numbers in aborted fetuses, fetal membranes, and uterine discharges. Cattle may ingest contaminated feed and water, or lick contaminated genitals of other animals. Venereal transmission by infected bulls to susceptible cows appears to be rare. Transmission may occur by artificial insemination when brucella-contaminated semen is deposited in the uterus but, reportedly, not when deposited in the mid-cervix. Brucellae may enter the body through mucous membranes, conjunctivae, wounds, or intact skin.

Brucellae have been recovered from fetuses and from manure that has remained in a cool environment for more than 2 months. Exposure to direct sunlight kills the organisms within a few hours.

Because organisms are shed in the milk, unpasteurized milk, and cheese represent a human health concern. Many individuals believe drinking unpasteurized milk is better for their health. Diseases that are not killed by pasteurization represent a risk to the consumer. Brucellosis in humans causes malaise, fever, chills, sweats, headache, neck pain, low back pain, joint pain, muscle pain, occasionally diarrhea, constipation, anorexia, weight loss, abdominal pain, weakness, irritability, insomnia, and depression. Brucellosis has been called undulating fever because of its habit of producing fever and signs that wax and wane over an extended period of time.
