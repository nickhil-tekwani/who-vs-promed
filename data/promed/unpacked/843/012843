A large increase in viral meningitis is being reported in the Duluth
area... but Saint Louis County officials are downplaying its significance.
They say most of the infections are common and usually result in cold-like
symptoms or diarrhea.
Since the middle of July, two area hospitals have seen 19 cases of viral
meningitis.
The county usually has eight cases a year. County officials say they think
most of the infections have been caused by a common group of viruses... and
that the infections tend to peak in late summer or early fall each year.
