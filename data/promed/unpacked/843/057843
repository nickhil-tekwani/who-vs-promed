In January 1998, 9 people contracted cholera in Hong Kong after eating
cockles imported from Thailand.
In March 1998, another 19 people were found to be infected on returning to
Hong Kong after travelling to Thailand. Among the 19, 3 were symptomatic.
The remaining 16 were found to be asymtomatic carriers of _Vibrio cholerae_
El Tor, serotype Ogawa. These 19 people were among a total of 64 people
travelling to Thailand in 2 tour groups. 40 people departed from Hong Kong
with the first group on 1 March 1998 and the second group of 24 people
departed on 2 March 1998.
The problem of cholera in Thailand was discussed briefly on ProMED-mail
last year. It was highlighted then that Thailand was not among the
countries who would notify the WHO of cholera cases occurring in the
country. My search of the WHO website on global cholera update for 1997 and
1998, confirmed that no Thailand data is available. Can anyone explain the
non-notification of cholera by Thailand? Can anyone inform me on the most
recent situation of cholera in Thailand? Are there any other countries
affected by cholera exported from Thailand?
Perhaps it is time that Thailand should consider playing a more active role
in the global surveillance of infectious diseases, as every member of the
international community should, by at least notifying the WHO of its
cholera cases.

[All countries belonging to WHO who have signed the International Health
Regulations (IHR) are obligated to report any suspect case of cholera to
WHO within 24 hours, but not all comply, often because they fear a ban on
their food exports as a result of notifying the disease. An unfortunate
example is the current European Union ban on fish exports from East Africa
because of the cholera epidemic there.
If anyone has current information on cholera in Thailand, we would be glad
to hear it. Japan often finds cholera in Japanese travelers returning from
Thailand; details of imported cases appear in Japan's epidemiological
records.
The asymptomatic carriers identified among travelers could pass the disease
on to fellow Japanese on their return. This could explain the occasional
case of cholera that Japan reports in a person with no history of foreign
travel - Mod.JW
