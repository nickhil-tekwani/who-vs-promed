Argentina announced this week a 2nd case of foot and mouth disease (FMD)
following the confirmation of the disease in a stray cow found in a
neighboring paddock to the farm where an outbreak was first reported 3
weeks ago in the north eastern province of Corrientes.
3 weeks ago Argentina, the world's 3rd [largest] exporter, confirmed that
70 livestock in a farm 25 kilometres from the Paraguayan border had been
diagnosed with FMD.
A spokesperson for Argentina's National Agro-food safety service, Senasa,
was quoted as saying, "It's an only cow [a single cow. - Mod.SH]. All the
other livestock from which blood samples were taken proved negative. The
cow and all other livestock which had been in contact were all sacrificed
when the first symptoms and suspicions arose."
In an official release, Senasa pointed out that the infected cow did not
have proper identification or an owner and did not figure in the
vaccination records for the area, which dated back to 11 Feb [2006?].
Senasa's spokesperson admitted that, following the rules of the Office
International des Epizooties [OIE], the new case is considered another
outbreak since it occurred in a different group of livestock. On 22 Feb
2006 Argentine authorities reported the suspicion (now confirmed) that the
cow was infected with the virus.
Argentina did not consider it a new outbreak, however, since it was inside
the 3 km perimeter of the original cases, but a closer look into OIE
regulations indicates it is an outbreak.
