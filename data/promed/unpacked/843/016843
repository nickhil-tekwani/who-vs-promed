Since the beginning of the year through 5 Jul [2020], the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) has reported a total of 2591 suspected monkeypox cases and 97 deaths. This includes 115 cases and 4 deaths recorded during the week ending 5 Jul [2020].

In 2019, DRC saw 5288 monkeypox cases, including 107 deaths (CFR: 2%) from 133 health zones in 19 provinces.

The World Health Organization says one major challenge to the current emergency include acquiring the required funding to respond to all the multiple ongoing outbreaks in the country. In addition to the monkeypox outbreak, the DRC is battling outbreaks of Ebola, measles, malaria, acute respiratory infections, typhoid, COVID-19, cholera, meningitis, diarrhea with dehydration in children under the age of 5 years, influenza, and yellow fever.

Monkeypox is a rare disease that occurs throughout remote parts of Central and West Africa, often near tropical rainforests. It is spread through contact with the monkeypox virus from an animal or human (alive or dead) or with materials contaminated with the virus.

Symptoms begin with fever, headache, muscle aches, swollen lymph nodes and exhaustion, and is followed by a rash. Patients are usually ill for 2-4 weeks. Monkeypox is fatal in as many as 10% of people who get it.

[Monkeypox [MPX] virus is endemic in the DRC, and the above report indicates that there are cases occurring again this year [2020]. This report does not indicate how many of the reported cases have been laboratory confirmed. Without confirmation, some of these cases may be chickenpox caused by varicella-zoster virus. There is no additional information about the circumstances under which these cases acquired their infection.

Monkeys are not the reservoirs of the virus, despite the name that the virus has received. Studies of the prevalence of MPX virus in populations of rodent hosts are not mentioned in this or previous reports. The main reservoirs of MPX virus are suspected to be rodents, including rope squirrels (_Funisciurus_ spp., an arboreal rodent) and terrestrial rodents in the genera _Cricetomys_ and _Graphiurus_. Halting the bushmeat trade and consumption of wild animals to halt MPX virus exposure will be culturally and economically difficult, so continued occurrence of cases can be expected. MPX virus can be transmitted between people but not readily. - Mod.TY
