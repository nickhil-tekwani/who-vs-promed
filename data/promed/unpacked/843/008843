Although the source article for this posting from Independent Online (https://www.iol.co.za/news/africa/yellow-fever-kills-at-least-15-in-ivory-coast-73036) came to ProMED yesterday [13 Sep 2017], the report is dated 7 Sep 2001.

We are grateful to ProMED correspondent Susan Baekeland and multiple ProMED readers who called the mistake to our attention. We also greatly appreciate the confirmation provided by William Brieger from the EYE (Global Strategy to Eliminate Yellow Fever Epidemics) Secretariat clarifying that there is no outbreak.

ProMED regrets any inconvenience or unnecessary concern that this post may have caused. - Mods.TY/JH
