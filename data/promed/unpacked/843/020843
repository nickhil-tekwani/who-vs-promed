The number of people sick from an outbreak of a gastrointestinal illness, called cyclosporiasis, linked to McDonald's salads is now 507, federal health officials said Thursday [23 Aug 2018]. All the illnesses have been confirmed with lab tests. In all, 24 of those individuals have been hospitalized.

The illnesses began between 20 May and 21 Jul 2018, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Illnesses have been reported in 16 states: Connecticut, Florida, Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, Ohio, South Dakota, Tennessee, Virginia, Wisconsin and New York.

The patients in Connecticut, New York, Tennessee and Virginia all purchased their salads while they were visiting Illinois, and the Florida patient purchased the suspect salad while in Kentucky, according to the CDC. "Epidemiologic evidence indicates that salads purchased from McDonald's restaurants are one likely source of these infections. The investigation is ongoing, and FDA [US Food and Drug Administration] is working to determine the sources of the ingredients that were in common to the salads served at McDonald's," the CDC said.

The _Cyclospora_ parasite causes intestinal illness in people who consume contaminated food or water. Symptoms can begin one week or more after consuming the parasite and include diarrhea and frequent, sometimes explosive, bowel movements, according to the CDC. Those who are infected might also experience loss of appetite, weight loss, stomach cramps or pain, nausea, gas and fatigue. Vomiting, headache, fever, body aches and flulike symptoms can also occur. The illness can last from a few days to a few months, and patients might feel better but then get worse again. Patients can be treated with antibiotics.

In July [2018], McDonald's pulled the suspected salad mix from approximately 3000 locations and switched its supplier. Subsequently, the outbreak investigation found the parasite in a sample of Fresh Express salad mix of romaine lettuce and carrots that had been distributed by the restaurant chain. On 27 Jul [2018], Fresh Express issued a recall for some lettuce that had been supplied to wholesale and institutional customers.

[ProMED reported a case count of 436 on 9 Aug 2018 and also reported that McDonald's had withdrawn the salad products suspected of being contaminated with _Cyclospora cayetanensis_, the single-cell parasite causing cyclosporiasis. If the right product has been identified, the case counts should start to decrease. The multistate outbreak is a reminder how our centralized food manufacture very effectively transmits infections to many separate locations. - Mod.EP
