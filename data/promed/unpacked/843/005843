Seeing that I started the postings on this matter, may I be permitted to at
least close this chapter -- before the recriminations commence.

Sydney Water gets all clear
Tue, 4 Aug 1998

The New South Wales Government says it is now safe to drink tap water in
all areas of Sydney without having to boil it. Planning Minister Craig
Knowles announced the all clear following a report on the crisis to State
Cabinet in Bathurst this morning.
Mr Knowles says the all clear covers the entire Sydney metropolitan area
and comes after test results showed zero levels of giardia and
cryptosporidia in the water supply. "There is no need to boil your water in
Sydney from now, the all clear for all alert zones has been given and in
that context Sydney water is now safe and clean to drink."
The Minister's Media Release and the Sydney Water advice did warn residents
to flush their household systems for several minutes before proceeding to
drink the water without boiling. It's a pity the media did not see fit to
pass this sensible advice on.

[I would remind members that this situation began with a laboratory water
quality report. So far the media has not reported any cases; hopefully
there will be none. Until such time as the results of their enquiries are
reported as to the source of this contamination, this thread is now cut. -
