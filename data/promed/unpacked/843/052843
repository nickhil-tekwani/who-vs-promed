An old disease transmitted by mosquitoes called eastern equine encephalitis [EEE] has reared its head in 8 US states so far in 2019, but health officials emphasize there's no need to bug out.

In a commentary published [Thu 21 Nov 2018] in the New England Journal of Medicine [see below], officials from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases noted that, as of [12 Nov 2019], there have been 36 confirmed cases of eastern equine encephalitis, or EEE, this year. In all, 14 of these cases were fatal.

"Although EEE isn't a major threat at this time, the public needs to be aware that it's out there," NIAID Director Anthony S Fauci, MD, told UPI.

To date, cases of EEE have been confirmed in Connecticut, Indiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, North Carolina, New Jersey, Rhode Island, and Tennessee. Massachusetts and Michigan lead the way with 12 and 10 cases, respectively.

The fact that many of these states, and other regions in the country, are moving into the colder winter months likely means few if any new cases of EEE will emerge before the end of the year because mosquitoes won't be as common, Fauci said. However, that could change come springtime, he added.

EEE has actually been around for centuries -- but the volume of cases in 2019 is highly unusual.

According to NIAID figures in the commentary, there were a total of 12 EEE outbreaks in the US between 1831 and 1959. However, Fauci added, the 36 reported in 2019 are the most in the country since 15 were documented in 2012. Generally, fewer than 10 cases are confirmed across the country annually, per figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

EEE now joins a growing list of diseases transmitted by mosquitoes that have struck the US in recent years. Other examples include dengue, West Nile, chikungunya, Zika, and Powassan [Powassan virus is tick-borne, not mosquito-borne. - Mod.TY].

At present, there is no easy and accurate test available to diagnose EEE, and there are no drugs to treat it or vaccines to prevent it. Those diagnosed with EEE are currently treated with supportive care, which often includes intensive care in a hospital and ventilator assistance. EEE does not spread from human to human. [There are accurate tests used to diagnose EEE. They include a test on serum or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to detect virus-specific IgM and neutralizing antibodies. - Mod.TY]

The disease is caused by the eastern equine encephalitis virus, or EEEV, which is spread between _Culiseta melanura_ mosquitoes and various tree-perching birds found in forested wetlands.

_C. melanura_ mosquitoes don't bite humans, Fauci said, but, occasionally, other mosquito species -- including the human-biting _Aedes aegypti_ -- can transmit the virus to people and other mammals after biting infected birds. [_A. aegypti_ is not a bridge species that transmits EEE virus between birds and humans or horses and the mention of them surely is an inaccurate misquote of Dr Fauci. The bridge mosquitoes include _Aedes_ other than _Ae. aegypti_ (which is tropical or subtropical), _Coquillettidia_, and _Culex_ species. - Mod.TY].

According to the CDC, only about 5 percent of human EEEV infections progress to EEE, and they do so usually within 3-10 days of infection.

Early symptoms include fever, malaise, intense headache, muscle aches, nausea and vomiting, Fauci and his co-authors noted, and roughly 1/3 of those who develop these symptoms will die, while others may suffer permanent and severe brain damage.

The CDC advises that those over 50 years of age and under 15 years of age seem to be at greatest risk for developing severe disease when infected with EEEV.

As with any mosquito-borne disease, Fauci suggested that people can reduce their risk for EEE by taking steps to avoid bites. Wearing long pants and/or long-sleeve shirts and using insect repellent can help, he said.

ref: Morens DM, Folkers GK, Fauci AS. Eastern equine encephalitis virus -- another emergent arbovirus in the United States.
N Engl J Med. 2019; 381(21): 1989-92
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humans have always lived in intimate association with arthropods that transmit pathogens between humans or from animals to humans. About 700 000 deaths due to vector-borne diseases occur globally each year, according to World Health Organization estimates. In the summer and fall of 2019, 9 US states have reported 36 human cases (14 of them fatal) of one of the deadliest of these diseases: eastern equine encephalitis (EEE), an arthropod-borne viral (arboviral) disease transmitted by mosquitoes. In recent years, the Americas have witnessed a steady stream of other emerging or reemerging arboviruses, such as dengue, West Nile, chikungunya, Zika, and Powassan, as well as increasing numbers of travel-related cases of various other arboviral infections. This year's [2019] EEE outbreaks may thus be a harbinger of a new era of arboviral emergences.

EEE has probably prevailed for centuries, and 12 US EEE epidemics or epizootics were documented between 1831 and 1959. Most known arboviruses that can infect humans, such as EEE virus (EEEV), circulate generally unnoticed in enzootic reservoirs of arthropods and vertebrate hosts such as birds and mammals. EEEV spreads between _Culiseta melanura_ mosquitoes and various passerine (tree-perching) birds found in forested wetlands (see figure [available at the source URL above]). Small mammals, reptiles, or amphibians may also be involved in its environmental circulation.

The virus occasionally spills over from its usual reservoirs to infect dead-end hosts such as humans, equids, swine, pheasants, various game and exotic birds, and gallinaceous poultry. These spillovers occur at unpredictable intervals and are usually mediated by "bridging vectors" (nonenzootic mosquitoes that feed on both birds and mammals) (see figure). EEEV is not transmitted between dead-end hosts such as horses and humans. Determinants of spillover most likely include complex interactions among human behaviors, weather, environmental perturbation, movement of birds, and other variables. EEEV is also a potential bioweapon since it is transmissible by aerosol. Although it has been found in most of the eastern United States, major persistent enzootic sites are relatively few and geographically focal; they can, however, be the source of seeding of additional EEEV foci.

Many other mosquito-borne or tick-borne diseases of mammals and humans occur throughout the United States and globally. The types of arthropods and other vectors vary geographically, and complex interactions between humans and the environment may be unique in each situation and location. Variables influencing disease emergence in one Massachusetts EEE focus exemplify the ecologic complexity of arboviruses. After Atlantic white cedar trees were harvested for use in houses and carpentry products and the resulting swamps were drained in the early 1800s, wetland forests were reestablished over the next century; these forests included red maple trees, whose roots -- lying just below bird-roosting sites -- provide excellent oviposition (egg-laying) sites for _C. melanura_ mosquitoes. As passerine birds such as American robins foraged from these trees in burgeoning suburbs, growth and movement of the human population facilitated spillovers of EEEV to humans, leading to cases of encephalitis.

More than 130 human and 50 animal arboviral diseases occur around the world. Most are transmitted by mosquitoes or ticks. Symptomatic human arboviral disease falls into 3 distinct syndromes: febrile systemic illness (such as uncomplicated dengue), hemorrhagic fever (such as dengue hemorrhagic fever and yellow fever), and encephalitis (such as, EEE, Venezuelan equine encephalitis, Japanese encephalitis, and La Crosse encephalitis). Each of these syndromes may be caused by multiple arboviruses from multiple unrelated taxonomic groups. Of the human-infecting arboviruses, 4 -- the flaviviruses dengue, yellow fever, and Zika, and the alphavirus chikungunya -- have evolved to infect a mosquito that is uniquely anthropophilic (feeding almost exclusively on humans): _Aedes aegypti_. Humans serve not only as the reservoir for these 4 viruses but also as an amplification host that up-regulates viral cycling. Any virus that can efficiently infect _A. aegypti_ also has potential access to billions of humans, which explains why the 4 viruses that have done so have spread pandemically. We cannot discount the possibility that other arboviruses will adapt to _A. aegypti_ in the future -- a sobering thought, given the high case-fatality rate of diseases such as EEE.

After inoculation of virus-infected mosquito saliva into perivascular dermal tissue, EEEV infects Langerhans and dendritic cells, which migrate to regional lymphoid tissue, where virus replication leads to systemic viremic seeding. After an incubation period of approximately a week (range, 3-10 days), EEEV infection presents nonspecifically with fever, malaise, intense headache, muscle aches, and nausea and vomiting -- a sign and symptom complex not easily distinguishable from those of most other arboviral infections or from influenza and a host of other diseases.

At the onset of symptoms, specific diagnostic tests may be unrevealing: viral isolation and polymerase-chain-reaction analysis from blood and spinal fluid, as well as testing for EEEV-specific IgM, may be negative. Neurologic signs appearing soon (0-5 days) after onset are initially nonspecific and are indistinguishable from those associated with enteroviral meningoencephalitis, which is also prevalent in late summer. However, rapid clinical progression ensues. By the time definitive serologic diagnosis is possible, within a week after infection, neurologic damage may already have occurred. Neuroimaging typically shows involvement of the basal ganglia and thalami.

An estimated 96% of people infected with EEEV remain asymptomatic; however, of those who have symptoms, 33% or more die and most of the rest sustain permanent, often severe, neurologic damage.

Point-of-care differential diagnostics for the many arboviral and non-arboviral causes of encephalitis are currently lacking and would be of limited value without effective treatments. Although antiviral drug screening efforts have been undertaken in vitro and in vivo, no antiviral drug has thus far been demonstrated to have efficacy against EEEV. An important requirement of such a drug, were it available, would be the ability to cross the blood-brain barrier. EEE-specific monoclonal antibodies have been effective in an experimental animal model only when given before infection, and data from experiments with Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (a related alphavirus) suggest that immunopathogenic mechanisms could be involved. Supportive care, often including admission to an intensive care unit with ventilatory support, is the mainstay of treatment. Patients need not be isolated since they are not infectious. Given the seriousness of the disease, social support and counseling of the patient and family are critically important.

Several EEEV vaccines are in development; however, there may not be strong incentives to proceed to advanced development and licensure because of the nature of the disease: outbreaks are rare, brief, and focal, and they occur sporadically in unpredictable locations, making it difficult to identify an appropriate target population for vaccination. Such vaccines, however, might have utility for persons at high occupational risk -- laboratory workers, for instance -- as is the case for an early-generation experimental EEEV vaccine now available under a US Army Investigational New Drug program. Efforts to develop mosquito saliva vaccines that would be effective against multiple mosquito-borne diseases are in early stages. A theoretical advantage of such vaccines is the inclusion of various salivary proteins from selected mosquitoes that transmit multiple arboviruses that infect humans.

In the absence of vaccines or specific treatments, state and local health departments can provide early warning of imminent human infections by surveilling equids, birds, and mosquitoes; however, even these blunt prevention tools are continuously threatened by underfunding of public health efforts. Sadly, the United States' ability to control arboviral diseases is little better in 2019 than it was more than a century ago, when William Crawford Gorgas eliminated _A. aegypti_ from Havana and the Panama Canal Zone. Recently, several American public health experts have called for a national defense strategy for arboviruses and other vector-borne diseases, an idea also supported by international experts. We strongly agree. Arbovirus threats are not easily thwarted by piecemeal efforts. Multiple potentially deadly viruses are constantly present in virologically occult enzootic foci throughout the United States and globally. Effects of climate and weather, such as changes in heat and rainfall and their impact on variables associated with viruses, vectors, and vertebrates, are cause for additional concern, since they may affect the life cycles and geographic distribution of arthropod vectors and viral transmission patterns. Given the near certainty of future emergences, arboviruses constitute a real and present danger. Although EEE is not yet a disease of major national importance, this year's [2019] spike in cases exposed our inadequate preparation for emergent disease threats. Though the best way to respond to these threats is not entirely clear, to ignore them completely and do nothing would be irresponsible.

[The reports above illustrate that 2019 has indeed been an active year for EEEV transmission with cases in humans and in horses. The CDC EEE web page (https://www.cdc.gov/easternequineencephalitis/index.html) states, "As of 19 Nov 2019, CDC has received reports of 36 confirmed cases of eastern equine encephalitis virus disease for this year [2019], including 14 deaths. Cases have been reported from the following 8 states: Connecticut (4), Indiana (1), Massachusetts (12), Michigan (10), North Carolina (1), New Jersey (4), Rhode Island (3), and Tennessee (1)."

There have been triple the number of horse cases over human cases this year (2019). Horse owners in eastern and upper midwestern states should vaccinate their animals. As the authors above state, there is no commercially available vaccine for humans. The sporadic nature of the relatively few human cases that occur annually and the extremely high cost of developing a vaccine for people and the difficulty in identifying a target population to vaccinate as the authors mention are insurmountable barriers to EEEV vaccine development. - Mod.TY
