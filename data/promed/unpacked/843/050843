Guernsey horse owners have been told to take necessary precautions
after suspected cases of horse strangles on the island.
In fact, this contagious horse disease has been the cause of the
British Show Jumping Association's winter competition being cancelled
this past weekend [26-27 Feb 2011] after a possible case of horses
strangles was diagnosed.
Owners on the island have been advised to keep their equines as close
to their homes as possible until vets have ascertained exactly what
the situation is.
Horse strangles is a respiratory infection that affects horses,
ponies, and donkeys.

[The original website has a photo of the effects of strangles on a
horse. All in all, this is a nasty disease and these animals are bound
to feel rotten.
Strangles is an infectious, contagious disease of _Equidae_,
characterized by abscesses in the lymphoid tissue of the upper
respiratory tract. The causative organism, _Streptococcus equi equi_,
is highly host-adapted and generally produces clinical disease only in
horses, donkeys, and mules. It is a Gram positive, capsulated,
hemolytic Lancefield group C streptococcus, which is an obligate
parasite and a primary pathogen.
_S. equi equi_ is highly contagious and produces high morbidity and
low mortality in susceptible populations. Transmission occurs via
fomites and direct contact with infectious exudates. Carrier animals
are important for maintenance of the bacteria between epizootics and
initiation of outbreaks on premises previously free of disease.
Survival of the organism in the environment is dependent on
temperature and humidity; it is susceptible to desiccation, extreme
heat, and exposure to sunlight, and must be protected within mucoid
secretions to survive. Under ideal environmental circumstances, the
organism can survive 7-9 weeks outside the host. Paddocks and barn
facilities used by infected horses should be regarded as contaminated
for about 2 months after resolution of an outbreak.
The incubation period of strangles is 3-14 days, and the 1st sign of
infection is a fever of 103-106 deg F (39.4-41.1 deg C). Within 24-48
hours of the initial fever spike, the horse will exhibit signs typical
of strangles, including mucoid to mucopurulent nasal discharge,
depression, and submandibular lymphadenopathy. Horses with
retropharyngeal lymph node involvement will have difficulty
swallowing, inspiratory respiratory noise (compression of the dorsal
pharyngeal wall), and extended head and neck. Older animals with
residual immunity may develop an atypical or catarrhal form of the
disease with mucoid nasal discharge, cough, and mild fever.
Metastatic strangles ("bastard strangles") is characterized by
abscesses in other lymph nodes of the body, particularly in the
abdomen and, less frequently, the thorax.

The environment for clinically ill horses should be warm, dry, and
dust-free. Warm compresses are applied to sites of lymphadenopathy to
facilitate maturation of abscesses. Facilitated drainage of mature
abscesses will speed recovery. Ruptured abscesses should be flushed
with dilute (3-5 percent) povidone-iodine solution for several days
until discharge ceases. NSAID (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs)
can be administered judiciously to reduce pain and fever and improve
appetite in horses with fulminant clinical disease.

Antimicrobial therapy is controversial. Most authors agree that
initiation of antibiotic therapy after abscess formation may provide
temporary clinical improvement in fever and depression but ultimately
prolongs the course of disease by delaying maturation of abscesses.
Antibiotic therapy is indicated in cases with dyspnea, dysphagia,
prolonged high fever, and severe lethargy/anorexia (loss of appetite).
Administration of penicillin during the early stage of infection (up
to 24 hours after onset of fever) will usually abort abscess
formation. The disadvantage of early antimicrobial treatment is
failure to mount a protective immune response, rendering horses highly
susceptible to infection after cessation of therapy. If antimicrobial
therapy is indicated, procaine penicillin (22 000 IU/kg, intramuscular
injection, twice a day) is the antibiotic of choice.
The affected horses are quite uncomfortable. Sharing of halters and
brushes that may contact the fluid from draining abscesses can spread
the disease to other horses. Those affiliated with the government
veterinary office are quite conscious of biosecurity and are able to
assist the track veterinarian and the owners with proper methods to
avoid spreading the disease.
