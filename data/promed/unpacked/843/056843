An outbreak of chikungunya was declared in the town of Mariveles [municipality], Bataan [province, Central Luzon region], after 100 patients were reported afflicted with the viral disease, Mayor Jesse Concepcion said Monday [16 Sep 2013]. Concepcion made the decision upon the recommendation of Dr Danilo Velasco, municipal health physician, who noted the abrupt rise in the number of chikungunya cases.

The mayor said he asked Velasco to prioritize the barangays (villages) which were severely affected to avert the further rise in chikungunya cases through search and destroy operations of the breeding sites of mosquitoes.

"We were surprised with the abrupt increase of chikungunya patients especially in [Mariveles municipality] Barangay Camaya with 40 cases, Baseco with 16, and Malaya with 16, and there are also cases in other villages. That's why our mayor declared an outbreak," Velasco said.

The health official said _Aedes aegypti_, the mosquito that transmits dengue [virus], is the same mosquito that [transmits] chikungunya [virus].

*****He added this was the 1st time for the town and province to have chikungunya cases and outbreak.

"Unlike dengue, a chikungunya patient does not suffer bleeding but experiences rashes, fever, and typically has joint pains," Velasco said.

Those afflicted with chikungunya in the town were from 2 to 70 years of age but most were men between 30 and 40 years old, the doctor said.

Only few cases were confined in the hospital since most opted to stay at home, he said, adding that some fully recovered while others complained of joint pains on their fingers.

Velasco said that although chikungunya is not as deadly as dengue, it should not be taken for granted. "If the patients have weak resistance, it might cause severe complications," he said.

He said they use the same procedure to examine patients manifesting symptoms of dengue. "Blood test, platelet count to be sure if it is dengue or chikungunya [virus infection]. If the platelet count is normal, it is most probably a chikungunya case," Velasco said.

He said the virus might have been brought to Mariveles by transients from areas in Luzon affected by chikungunya [virus infection].

Mariveles is home to more than 60 multi-national firms where workers from all over Luzon are employed.

He said they will urge the residents in 18 barangays to maintain cleanliness in their surroundings to ensure that the breeding sites of the mosquitoes are destroyed. This mosquito breeds only in clear, clean, and stagnant [sic; probably meaning not running as in rivers or streams] water.

[Chikungunya virus outbreaks continue in several localities of the Philippines this year (2013). An effective public education effort will be necessary to enlist public collaboration for elimination of vector mosquito breeding sites. No commercial vaccine is available to prevent chikungunya virus infections.
