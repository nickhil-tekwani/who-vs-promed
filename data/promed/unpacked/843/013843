Bird flu has killed hundreds of wild black vultures at a Georgia sanctuary that houses more than 1500 other animals.

At least 700 black vultures have died, Noah's Ark animal care manager Allison Hedgecoth told WXIA-TV. State workers euthanized 20 to 30 other birds, she said.

"All of our chickens were euthanized yesterday [23 Aug 2022] and our turkeys and our guinea hens," she said.

State officials have set up a 6-mile (9.6 km) perimeter around the sanctuary in hope of containing the spread, according to WXIA.

"With birds that are able to move around and airborne, this disease could spread pretty rapidly if it's not contained very quickly," state Senator Emanuel Jones told the station.

No other birds at the Noah's Ark sanctuary have tested positive for or shown symptoms of the highly pathogenic H5N1 strain, sanctuary officials told news outlets.

An outbreak of the virus in the US has led to the deaths of 40 million chickens and turkeys and about 2000 wild birds this year [2022]. The wild birds include more than 240 black vultures and nearly 220 bald eagles, according to the US Department of Agriculture. Even seals have died from it.

Officials said they were told Saturday [20 Aug 2022] that initial tests indicate the black vultures that roost at Noah's Ark died of the highly pathogenic H5N1 strain. State authorities were notified when an unusual number of dead vultures were found on 13 Aug 2022, according to a statement released to news outlets.

Noah's Ark is in Locust Grove, about 30 miles (48 km) south-east of Atlanta. It's more than 100 miles (160 km) north-west of the area where hundreds of birds in a mixed backyard flock died or were euthanized earlier this year [2022] and most of the previously reported 15 wild bird deaths from the virus were located.

[The Eurasian H5N1 first detected in January 2022 on the Atlantic coast of North America continues to hit wild birds across the continent. Some wild migratory waterbirds contribute to the propagation of HPAI viruses. However, it is important to acknowledge that only a few bird species may play a role in the propagation of HPAI viruses. Most wild bird species, as well as poultry and other domestic birds, are neither tolerant nor resistant to HPAI viruses, and thus they become ill and do not move much, which implies that are poor spreaders and instead they may act as sentinels of viral circulation. Only a few species that migrate and can tolerate these viruses, presumably some Anseriformes, are key players driving the spread of this epidemic. The fact that most bird species are susceptible to HPAI viruses is a concern for the conservation of many species. This is the case for birds of prey and scavengers, which are exposed to the virus when feeding on other infected birds. - Mod.PMB
