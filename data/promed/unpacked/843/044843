_E. coli_ O157 investigation ends
---------------------------------
The joint investigation by NHS Orkney and Orkney Islands Council has ended today, 11 Sep 2012. The investigation began on 17 Aug 2012 and identified 8 cases in all, of whom 6 were confirmed as having _E. coli_ O157 infection. The remaining cases were suspected because of their symptoms. 1 confirmed case remains in hospital.

Dr Louise Wilson, Director of Public Health, NHS Orkney: "We have found no direct link connecting all the cases. The investigation team have worked hard to try and identify where the infection came from and how people became infected. Although we could identify some general common similarities, we could not pinpoint a common source. This is not unusual in an investigation. We had cases located across Orkney and the national laboratory, using genetic fingerprinting techniques, found 3 strains of _E. coli_ O157 among the 6 confirmed cases. So it is not surprising that we cannot say with certainty where the infections originated, or how the cases came to be infected.

"The cause of infection in some of the cases may -- I do emphasise that this is theoretical -- have included cross-contamination between raw meat and cooked meat or other products, or insufficient cooking of meat products (the bacterium is killed when the meat is completely cooked), and/or contact with an environment contaminated by animal faeces containing the bacterium.

"We must all bear in mind that any raw meat product and any environment where animals have been may be contaminated with pathogens, including _E. coli_ O157."

Dr Wilson advised continued vigilance among the general public: "Every day, we all have a part to play in avoiding a wide range of infections, and excellent hand hygiene and correct food preparation are at the heart of that.

"Good hand hygiene after using the toilet, ensuring food is properly cooked, and avoiding cross-contamination between raw and cooked foods are simple protective steps we can all take to reduce the risk of infection to ourselves and our families," said Dr Wilson. "Washing your hands after contact with animals or the environment is also important. Wherever you are and whatever you are doing, always think about hygiene."
