A female, middle-aged patient died recently with respiratory and
kidney problems. Serology was positive for hantavirus (Sin Nombre
group). The clinical picture was compatible & the patient lived in a
rural area [Tupi Paulista where grain was stored [therefore rodents
were abundant - Mod.JW.
The Institute Adolfo Lutz (research & public health lab of the State
Health Secretariat of Sao Paulo State) is investigating, capturing
rodents in the region and carrying out a serological survey in
humans. Samples from the patient have been sent to CDC, USA.
Other cases [of hantavirus infection have been described from Sao
Paulo state, but not from this area.
