In 2016, a mysterious illness spread inside the National Institutes of Health's Clinical Center, the U.S. government's most prominent research hospital, in Bethesda, Maryland. Patients were somehow being sickened by an antibiotic-resistant strain of bacteria that practically never causes disease in humans. Two years later, a new study seems to finally have confirmed where this bug likely came from: the hospital's own plumbing.

During a 6-month period in 2016, 6 patients came down with infections caused by _Sphingomonas_ bacterium. Four of the patients had an antibiotic-resistant strain of a particular species, _Sphingomonas koreensis_, which was 1st discovered in some of Korea's natural mineral water spots in the early 2000s.

The authors behind the study, published this week [week of Mon 24 Dec 2018] in the New England Journal of Medicine [1], looked through hospital records at the center dating back to the 2000s and found 8 other cases of people with _S. koreensis_ in their bodies from 2006 onwards. Then they sequenced the bacterial DNA of samples taken from patients as well as from various environments of the hospital. They also compared these samples to other samples of _S. koreensis_ taken from other places and patients outside of the hospital.

The 2016 samples all bore an incredibly close genetic similarity to one another (99.92 percent similar, in fact). They were also closely related to the past samples but not so much to the outside samples, indicating these particular bacteria have been calling the NIH Clinical Center home for some time. The samples taken from faucets and water sources in the patients' rooms also matched up closely to the 2016 samples, implicating the plumbing system as the likely conduit for infection.

_S. koreensis_ is a Gram-negative bacterium. Gram-negative describes bacteria that show up as pinkish or red when exposed to a common chemical stain used to identify them under a microscope. This happens because their cell walls are very different from Gram-positive bacteria. That same cell wall also unfortunately makes them naturally resistant to many antibiotics. And the widespread overuse of antibiotics has only made Gram-negative bacteria even tougher to deal with, especially in hospitals.

The bacteria itself isn't a particularly potent pathogen, though. Prior to the current study, there were only 2 other documented cases of _S. koreensis_ infection, with the 1st reported in 2015. And though 3 of the 12 NIH patients identified with _S. koreensis_ in their body eventually died, it's possible they were killed by other contributing factors, including other major infections.

Nine of the 12 patients, including the 3 who died, had been given stem-cell transplants beforehand, meaning their immune systems were already weakened. One patient appeared to have only carried the bacteria in their body, not actually becoming sick as a result.

Near as the authors can tell, _S. koreensis_ might have gotten inside the NIH sometime in 2004, when a new building underwent construction. And it survived, at least partly, thanks to a poorly maintained water system. They found both low levels of chlorine in the water, as well as water that was not heated as high as it should have been. Since the hospital took steps to better clean its water, though, there have been no other cases reported.

That said, _S. koreensis_ is only the latest resistant bug to cause an outbreak at the NIH Clinical Center. And given the uphill climb to stop or even slow down the rise of antibiotic resistance, it almost certainly won't be the last.

"Abstract
-----
Background. Plumbing systems are an infrequent but known reservoir for opportunistic microbial pathogens that can infect hospitalized patients. In 2016, a cluster of clinical _Sphingomonas_ infections prompted an investigation.

Methods. We performed whole-genome DNA sequencing on clinical isolates of multidrug-resistant _Sphingomonas koreensis_ identified from 2006 through 2016 at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Center. We cultured _S. koreensis_ from the sinks in patient rooms and performed both whole-genome and shotgun metagenomic sequencing to identify a reservoir within the infrastructure of the hospital. These isolates were compared with clinical and environmental _S. koreensis_ isolates obtained from other institutions.

Results. The investigation showed that 2 isolates of _S. koreensis_ obtained from the 6 patients identified in the 2016 cluster were unrelated, but 4 isolates shared more than 99.92 percent genetic similarity and were resistant to multiple antibiotic agents. Retrospective analysis of banked clinical isolates of _Sphingomonas_ from the NIH Clinical Center revealed the intermittent recovery of a clonal strain over the past decade. Unique single-nucleotide variants identified in strains of _S. koreensis_ elucidated the existence of a reservoir in the hospital plumbing. Clinical _S. koreensis_ isolates from other facilities were genetically distinct from the NIH isolates. Hospital remediation strategies were guided by results of microbiologic culturing and fine-scale genomic analyses.

Conclusions. This genomic and epidemiologic investigation suggests that _S. koreensis_ is an opportunistic human pathogen that both persisted in the NIH Clinical Center infrastructure across time and space and caused healthcare-associated infections.

The NIH Clinical Center, which opened in 1953 in Bethesda, Maryland, one of Washington DC's suburbs, has 200 inpatient hospital beds, 11 operating rooms, 93 day hospital stations, critical care services and research labs, and an ambulatory care research facility; the facility treats without charge only people who have a medical condition being studied by the NIH Institutes or Centers and who meet the specific inclusion criteria for enrollment in the studies (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institutes_of_Health_Clinical_Center).

_Sphingomonas_ is a genus of Gram-negative, rod-shaped, strictly aerobic bacteria that include more than 20 species, which contain glycosphingolipids instead of lipopolysaccharide in their cell envelopes (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphingomonas). One particular _Sphingomonas_ species, _Sphingomonas paucimobilis_, is a known human pathogen that has been found in equipment in hospitals and various types of clinical specimens, including respiratory therapy items, humidifiers, water, air, bedside water bottles, sinks, and temperature probes (1). In addition, _Sphingomonas_ species have been frequently found in public drinking water.

_Sphingomonas_ species have been shown to secrete extracellular polysaccharides, which are the major component of microbial biofilms (2), and biofilm formation by these bacteria on the inner walls of water supply systems would allow for their persistence in the water supply (2, 3-6). Furthermore, chlorination has been reported to have little effect in preventing biofilm development (2, 6).
