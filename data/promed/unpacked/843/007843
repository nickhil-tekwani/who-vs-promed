Health Ministry disproves rumor on vaccination-caused A (H1N1) outbreak in
Beijing
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Chinese Ministry of Health on Monday [2 Nov 2009] disproved an online
rumor that the recent pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza outbreak in Beijing
was caused by vaccination among students for the country's National Day [1
October] celebration. "The rumor violates scientific theories and is not
consistent with the truth," said the ministry's spokesman Mao Qunan. "It is
totally fabrication." Reports on some foreign websites said primary and
secondary school students in Beijing were given vaccine shots to prevent
pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza before the People's Republic of China
celebrated its 60th founding anniversary on 1 Oct 2009. And those vaccines
had led to the recent outbreak in the capital city.

The spokesman said that Beijing had not carried out large-scale vaccination
among primary and secondary school students before the National Day.
Besides, no epidemic outbreak would occur among people who have already
been given vaccination, since the vaccine was proved to be effective, he added.

As the 1st country that issued a production license for (H1N1) 2009 virus
vaccines, China had inoculated more than 3.78 million people as of Saturday
[31 Oct 2009], with no reports of serious adverse reactions, according to
the ministry. About 33.4 million doses of vaccine have been approved for
use as of 31 Oct 2009, 26 million of which have been dispatched to local
medical institutions.

Calculating the current product abilities of the 8 domestic vaccine
manufacturers, a total of 100 million doses of pandemic (H1N1) 2009
influenza vaccine will be produced by the 1st quarter of next year [2010],
according to the ministry. But for now, about 390 million people on the
Chinese mainland needed the flu shots including service personnel of the
People's Liberation Army and armed police forces, police, medical staff,
teachers, students, people working at key public service posts, and
patients with chronic or cardiovascular diseases, experts said.

As of Monday [2 Nov 2009], more than 48 000 confirmed cases of pandemic
(H1N1) 2009 influenza had been reported on the Chinese mainland, 74 per
cent of whom had recovered. Among the 118 serious cases, 84 were still in
hospital, the ministry said. The Chinese mainland has reported 7 deaths
from influenza since 2 Oct 2009.
