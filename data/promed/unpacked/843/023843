The sugar cane growers of Nabarangpur district are up against an
unknown disease. Yet to be identified, it has destroyed cane over
2000 hectares (4942 acres) in the past one month. Such massive damage
has virtually dwindled the fortunes of the growers of the cash crop.
Crops on thousands of acres of land in Nabarangpur, Nandahandi,
Tentulikhunti, and Kosagumuda blocks of the district have been
damaged. The worst affected areas are Bikrampur, Nandahandi, Dahana,
Ekamba, Dangarveja, Sasan, and Deula villages where over 50 percent
crop has gone to waste.
Despite heavy downpours for the past 3 months the green cane plant
turns yellow and brown, the cane juice dries up and the plant
dwindles. Earlier, the farmers suspected the disease to be red rot
syndrome and treated accordingly, but in vain. The few officials
present in the office had advised the farmers to spray 'fungicide' on
the plants to curb the disease but that proved futile. In the absence
of a special research centre for sugar cane farming in Nabarangpur or
Koraput district, the farmers depend on the district agriculture
unit, which has no proper resources to take up their pleas. On the
other hand, the District Agriculture Officer post has also been
vacant for a long time. This has only worsened the woes of the cultivators.
"With no help from the Agriculture Department here, we are helpless
and have left everything to God," said Kuna Dash, a cane farmer of
Bikrampur whose crop has got 75 percent damaged. The farmers have
urged the Agriculture Ministry to send a team to identify the
disease. Deputy Director of Agriculture, Koraput circle, SK Patel
directed the agriculture team to review the situation and promised
all possible help to the farmers.
For the 1st time in 30 years such a plant disease has gripped the
sugar cane patches of the district.

[Red rot disease of sugarcane is caused by the fungus _Glomerella
tucumanensis_ (synonym _Colletotrichum falcatum_). In India, red rot
is considered a very serious disease in different states and was
responsible for the elimination of many elite sugarcane varieties. A
number of other fungal pathogens are known to affect sugarcane as
well, but the failure of fungicide treatments reported above would
indicate that the problem is not caused by a fungus.
On the other hand, the symptoms described may point towards yellow
leaf disease (YLD), a recently identified disease, which is prevalent
in other major sugarcane growing areas of India. Sugarcane yellow
leaf virus (SCYLV) has been associated with YLD of sugarcane in
India. The virus was placed in the family of _Luteoviridae_ but has
not yet been assigned to a genus. It is transmitted by aphids in a
persistent manner and also spread with infected plant material.
Affected crops exhibit a characteristic leaf yellowing extending
outwards from the midrib. Eventually, the affected leaf dies. When
YLD becomes severe, cane thickness and stalk height are significantly
reduced. Symptoms are more prominent on mature sugarcane plants under
stress conditions. The symptoms may either be confined to a few
clumps of plants or spread over the whole area of the field. Overall,
the disease results in loss of plant vigour and can lead to the
premature death of the crop. Large patches of cane have been reported
to dry up due to YLD, and a yield loss of up to 95 percent has been
recorded for some sugarcane cultivars. Disease management includes
vector control and the use of clean planting material. Resistant
sugarcane varieties are being developed.
Research and diagnosis of sugarcane diseases, including YLD, is
carried out at the Indian Sugarcane Breeding Institute (SBI;
Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu). It appears that a lack of extension workers
to instigate the process is contributing to the problems of these farmers.
