Re: Ebolavirus, animal reservoir: OIE [archived 20141010.2851028]

One wishes that the Spanish health authorities had had access to this type of information before deciding to euthanize the pet dog belonging to the Spanish nurse sadly affected by Ebola virus.

Beside any ethical consideration, one is left wondering what level of trust can be given to an health authority that acts regardless of the scientific evidence when faced by a critical situation such as the sporadic Ebola cases occurring outside of Africa.

[Dr D'Alterio refers to OIE's document as a reference according to which the nurse's dog should not have been euthanized. Most likely, he refers specifically to the following statement in the said document: "There is no evidence that domestic animals play an active epidemiological role in the transmission of the disease to humans."

It will be interesting to note whether the Spanish health authorities, while aware of the scarce scientific knowledge on the issue, may have based their difficult decision to euthanize the dog upon the "precautionary principle" or "precautionary approach." In short, the "precautionary principle" is a notion which supports taking protective action before there is complete scientific proof of a risk; that is, action should not be delayed simply because full scientific information is lacking. This principle has been an essential part of the international agreement (Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures, the "SPS Agreement"), of which OIE is a signatory, an essential part thereof being the precautionary principle.

In some legal systems, as in the law of the European Union, the application of the precautionary principle has been made a statutory requirement in some areas of law.

The Spanish authorities could have been cognizant of OIE's document when discussing the dog issue before action was taken. OIE issued the document, "technical information sheet on Ebola virus disease outlining epidemiological observations and scientific knowledge of the disease including the animal reservoir," on 6 Oct 2014, the very day when the nurse was found positive for Ebola virus.

The potential role of dogs in Ebola epidemiology has been subject to a study, the results of which were published in 2005. For subscribers' convenience, its abstract is copied below:

"Ebola Virus Antibody Prevalence in Dogs and Human Risk. Lois Allela, Olivier Bourry, Regis Pouillot, Andre Delicat et al. (2005). Emerging Infectious Diseases 11 (3) pp 385-390.

Abstract
During the 2001-2002 outbreak in Gabon, we observed that several dogs were highly exposed to Ebola virus by eating infected dead animals. To examine whether these animals became infected with Ebola virus, we sampled 439 dogs and screened them by Ebola virus-specific immunoglobulin (Ig) G assay, antigen detection, and viral polymerase chain reaction amplification. Seven (8.9 percent) of 79 samples from the 2 main towns, 15 (15.2 percent) of 99 samples from Mekambo, and 40 (25.2 percent) of 159 samples from villages in the Ebola virus-epidemic area had detectable Ebola virus-IgG, compared to only 2 (2 percent) of 102 samples from France. Among dogs from villages with both infected animal carcasses and human cases, seroprevalence was 31.8 percent. A significant positive direct association existed between seroprevalence and the distances to the Ebola virus-epidemic area. This study suggests that dogs can be infected by Ebola virus and that the putative infection is asymptomatic.
