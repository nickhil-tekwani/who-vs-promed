Tularemia on Martha's Vineyard," New England Journal of Medicine, Vol. 301,
No. 15, 1979, p826-828.
[The authors seemed to think that a barn was infested with mice, and this
epizootic pool led to a pet dog having come into contact with fomites. When
the dog shook the water off his coat, as dogs will do at the drop of a hat,
this could have generated inhalable, infectious particles. I understand
that there are 2 different biovars [_F. tularensis_ biovar tularensis (type
A) is highly virulent for most mammals, rabbits are a common reservoir, and
it is often transmitted by ticks. _F. tularensis_ biovar palearctica (type
B) is not as virulent as type A and causes epizootics in beavers, voles,
and muskrats. It is worth noting that numerous species of mammals serve as
reservoirs and many bloodsucking arthropods serve as vectors. - Man. Ed.
DS in this hemisphere and in Eurasia, and so infectivity rates and routes
may differ; in that event, and for the sake of completeness:

Hannu Syrjala, Pekka Kujala, Valtteri Myllyla, and Aimo Salminen, "Airborne
Transmission of Tularemia in Farmers," Scandinavian Journal of Infectious
Disease, Vol. 17, No. 4, p371-5.
Contrary to what [has been alleged by Ken Alibek, I doubt that the Red
Army used tularemia as a weapon during the siege of Stalingrad (1942-3).
However, Soviet epidemiologic retrospectives did note that German soldiers
made beds out of hay, and thrashing the dry weeds generated fomites. Voles
were quite common at that time, and the water was severely contaminated
with our friend _F. tularensis_. Similar infections occurred among farmers
in Scandinavia (see cite above). Thus, a number of casualties -- both
Russian and German during the war -- were linked to breathing infectious
particles, in addition to contaminated biscuits, water, and whatnot.
I remember my father or uncle telling me a long time ago not to dress a
rabbit if one has cuts on the hands. But I wonder how often infections have
occurred by the kinetic force of tearing wet tissue, generating aerosols,
and breathing in _F. tularemia_? What is it, you need something like 10-50
particles to start an infection?
If anyone is interested in this further, don't hesitate to contact me.

[The 2 references, above, are examples of how _F. tularensis_ may be
transmitted via the aerosol route. An even more compelling example is the
report McCarthy V.P., M.D. Murphy. Lawnmower tularemia. Ped Infect Dis J,
9:298-300, 1990 in which 2 boys acquired tularemia via aerosol from running
over a rabbit with a hand-pushed lawnmower. The boys saw "fur flying" and
deliberately ran over the rabbit a second time. For a recent discussion of
a case of pneumonia due to _F. tularensis_ in Massachusetts, the interested
reader is directed to Shapiro D., Mark E. Case records of the
Massachusetts General Hospital. Weekly clinicopathological exercises. A
60-year-old farm worker with bilateral pneumonia. New England Journal of
Medicine, 342:1430-1438 (2000). - Man. Ed. DS
