At least 4 people have died and 2 mothers have lost their unborn babies as
a result of a serious gastroenteritis epidemic that has hit Rouxville in
the Free State in the past 2 weeks.
Mohokare municipality manager K J Mokgotsi earlier had sent out a letter
apologizing to residents for the "inconvenience caused by water
problems". There have been suspicions that polluted water might be at the
root of the problem. The letter was included with the latest municipal
services accounts.
The water supply and stools from sick residents were analyzed last week.
Results were not yet available.
