Mutation of common cold possibly linked to death of 4 BC seniors
----------------------------------------------------------------
A mutation of the common cold could have played a role in the death of 4
seniors at a care home, according to health officials on Vancouver Island.
In early January 2008, the Vancouver Island Health Authority declared an
outbreak of human metapneumovirus [infection] at the Dufferin Place
extended-care facility in Nanaimo.

More than 60 of 150 residents at the facility were infected with the virus
and 4 eventually died. But Vancouver Island Health Authority spokesperson
Suzanne Germain said there is no way of knowing if the virus was directly
responsible for the deaths. The outbreak lasted around 6 weeks, said
Germain, who added outbreaks of various kinds are common in residential
care homes.

Human metapneumovirus is a human respiratory pathogen 1st discovered in
2001. It can cause both upper and lower tract disease and can lead to
serious illness in the young, those with suppressed immune systems, and the
chronically ill.

[The 1st sentence of this report is confusing in that it implies that a
mutant of the common cold [virus] has been responsible for this outbreak,
whereas the etiologic agent has been identified as Human metapneumovirus.

These 2 viruses are unrelated taxonomically. The common cold viruses are
unenveloped viruses classified in the genus _Rhinovirus_ (family
_Picornaviridae_), whereas Human metapneumovirus is an enveloped virus
classified in the genus _Pneumovirus_ (family _Paramyxoviridae_). Although
Human metapneumovirus has only recently been discovered, increasing
diagnostic capability is defining it as an important human respiratory
pathogen.

In 2001 van den Hoogen and colleagues, at the Erasmus Medical Center in
Rotterdam, reported the discovery of a novel pneumovirus (a type of virus
previously associated only with avians) present in young children with
respiratory tract disease. The virus was recovered from 28 children and
identified as a tentative new member of the genus _Metapneumovirus_ of the
sub-family _Pneumovirinae_ of the family _Paramyxoviridae_, based on
virological data, sequence homology and gene organisation. The clinical
symptoms of the children from whom the human metapneumovirus was isolated
were similar to those caused by respiratory syncytial virus infection,
ranging from upper respiratory tract disease to severe bronchiolitis and
pneumonia. From serological studies they conclude that by the age of 5
years virtually all children in the Netherlands have been exposed to human
metapneumovirus and that the virus has been circulating in humans for at
least 50 years. Subsequently the same virus was found to be equally
prevalent worldwide. The report from British Columbia is significant in
that older people were affected and some deaths occurred.

The possible avian origin of this human pathogen is intriguing. A total of
4 serotypes of Turkey rhinotracheitis virus (avian pneumovirus) are known
and the recently discovered human metapneumovirus shows closest resemblance
by phylogenetic analysis to avian pneumovirus type C, which has been found
predominantly in domestic fowl in the USA.
