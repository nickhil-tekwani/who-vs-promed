A devastating disease sometimes referred to as "rabbit Ebola" has been detected for the 1st time in Idaho, with state officials warning domestic rabbit owners to take precautions.

Rabbit hemorrhagic disease, or RHD, is an incredibly deadly disease that's easily spread among rabbits. It isn't known to affect humans, livestock, or other species of pets.

Two dead jackrabbits near the Boise Airport were confirmed to have tested positive for RHD Thursday night [25 Mar 2021] by the Foreign Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory [FADDL] in New York -- the 1st time it's been detected in the state. They were initially sent for testing on [8 Mar 2021] before being forwarded to FADDL for confirmation.

Idaho state veterinarian Dr Scott Leibsle said domestic rabbit owners need to take steps to protect their colonies, like elevating them off the ground if they're small enough.

"Minimize any type of interaction with wild rabbits, any opportunity for that to happen, and then, disinfect your boots or your coveralls, wash your hands before you interact with your rabbits before and afterwards," Leibsle said.

Often, the only symptom a rabbit might display if they contract the disease is sudden death. Other symptoms include a loss of appetite, a bloody nose, and dullness.

RHD can survive on clothing or carcasses for months and can also be spread by fleas, flies, and mosquitoes.

Leibsle said to never handle a dead rabbit in the wild and to call Idaho Fish & Game if you find one.

Any domestic rabbit suspected of contracting RHD should be immediately isolated and its owner should notify their vet and the Idaho State Department of Agriculture.

If the rabbit survives, Leibsle said it could still spread the disease to others. "Those animals that do survive certainly could be a risk for continued shedding and transmission of the virus."

The Idaho State Department of Agriculture has not mandated these animals be euthanized, nor has it asked for rabbit shows to be cancelled.

A vaccine is available, but it's not easy to get in the United States. It has to be imported from Europe with the approval of federal regulators.

Leibsle said rabbit owners who do want to vaccinate their animals should get a group together and approach a veterinarian who would be willing to try to import it. He said he'd then work with that vet to get the proper permits in place to get a bulk shipment of vaccine to Idaho.

New Mexico became the 1st state to record a case of this strain of RHD last year [2020] in wild rabbits. It's since been detected in several other Western states.

[In the 1980s, the European rabbit (_Oryctolagus cuniculus_) populations were devastated by a virus that caused an extremely lethal and highly contagious disease, rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD). The 1st outbreak of this new disease was reported in 1984 in the Jiangsu Province of China within a group of commercially-bred Angora rabbits imported from Germany. As the virus spread worldwide, naturally occurring RHD outbreaks were reported in geographically distant regions, such as Cuba, Uruguay, and Reunion Island.

RHD is a highly pathogenic lagovirus endemic in Europe and Australasian populations of the European rabbit, _Oryctolagus cuniculus_. It has also caused several unexplained disease outbreaks in domestic European rabbits in North America.

RHD is characterised by high morbidity and high mortality (70-90%) in European rabbits and spreads very rapidly by direct and indirect transmission. Infection can occur by nasal, conjunctival or oral routes.

Transmission of RHD is facilitated by the high stability of the virus in the environment. Lesions are primary liver necrosis and a massive disseminated intravascular coagulopathy in all organs and tissues. The most severe lesions are in the liver, trachea, and lungs.

In 2010, a new genotype of RHD (RHD-2) emerged and where it propagated it replaced the original strain. This new variant causes lethal infections also in juvenile (<2 months old) and RHD vaccinated rabbits. After its 1st detection in France, RHD-2 spread rapidly and infections were reported in several European countries, North America, the Middle East, and Australia
