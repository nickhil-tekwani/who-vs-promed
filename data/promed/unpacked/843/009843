Quarantine was established due to a new outbreak of anthrax in the Kostanay region, the [KazTAG] agency reports.

"Quarantine has been established on the property of Batalinskoye LLP, Zhaltyrkol village, Arkhangelsk rural district, Denisov district, Kostanay region, due to the occurrence of cattle anthrax disease," said the statement from the akimat [district administration] of the rural district.

Previously on 13 Jul 2021, KazTAG reported that quarantine was introduced due to an outbreak of anthrax in the Kostanay region. On the same day [13 Jul 2021], it became known that 3 people were infected with the disease.

Anthrax is a particularly dangerous infectious disease in livestock and wild animals of all types, as well as humans, often leading to the death of the sick person in the very first days of infection.

An anthrax case in a head of cattle was reported in the village of Zhaltyrkol, Kostanay region, Agroqogam.kz reports. Accordingly, the forced slaughter of the animal was carried out in the property of Batalinskoye LLP. In total, there were 166 head of cattle involved in the outbreak.

By the decision of the akim [administrator] of the Arkhangelsk rural district, quarantine was introduced on the farm, which, presumably, will be lifted next week.

"The fact was revealed on [26 Oct 2021]. There are no livestock deaths [at that time]. The situation is now stable. As it should be, disinfection was carried out, "said Akat Shektybaev, head of the veterinary department of the akimat of Kostanay region.

Quarantine was introduced in the village of Zhaltyrkol, Kostanay region due to an outbreak of anthrax among cattle, Kazakhstan Today reports. Quarantine was established on the property of Batalinskoye LLP [limited liability partnership] in the village of Zhaltyrkol, Arkhangelsk rural district, Denisov district, Kostanay region, "in connection with the occurrence of anthrax disease in cattle," as reported in the regional akim's decree in the newtimes.kz publication.

Note that this is not the first case of an outbreak of a dangerous disease in the Denisov district of the Kostanay region. In July of this year [2021], in the same area, there was a death of livestock due to anthrax. Earlier it was reported that in Northern Kazakhstan an LLP employee who took part in meat cutting, contracted anthrax.

[The location of this later cattle death is clearly shown in the July 22nd OIE report on the previous outbreak in QostanyL (https://wahis.oie.int/#/report-info?reportId=36492). It is in northern Kazakhstan and right on the border with Russia.

Late secondary bovine outbreaks are not unexpected and arise from cattle finding bloody soil which is nice and salty. This is why it is so important to properly dispose of all carcasses in any anthrax outbreak. They are curious beasts and will explore anything that catches their interest.

Kazakhstan has been working hard over the past few decades to control anthrax and has largely succeeded. The present situation is but a fraction of what it was. To see their progress, read the following article, which has very useful maps, "Spatio-temporal analysis and visualisation of the anthrax epidemic situation in livestock in Kazakhstan over the period 1933-2016" at https://bit.ly/3HgDnBm.

According to this paper, prior to the outbreaks this year (2021) the last outbreak(s) in Qostany were in 1984-2001. Unintentionally digging up old anthrax graves can present risks if viable spores are brought to the surface. Genotyping these recent cases would help determine what might have happened or not. Again, many thanks to Mahmoud for forwarding this information from Kazakhstan. - Mod.MHJ
