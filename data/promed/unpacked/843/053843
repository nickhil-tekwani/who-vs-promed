According to the ARY TV report, a 40-year-old male was admitted in a private hospital in Karachi, where he later died. The case was confirmed to be due to _Naegleria_. The Sindh Health department declared it as 1st case of _Naegleria_ infection in Karachi in 2018 and also advised the general public on appropriate preventive measures. According to this report, 6 cases of _Naegleria_ infection were reported during last year [2017].

[The 1st cases of primary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM) were detected in Karachi as early as 2008 (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/17/2/10-0442_article). During 2017, 6 deaths were reported on account of _Naegleria infection_, mainly limited to Karachi Sindh.

Most _Naegleria fowleri_ infections are associated with swimming in warm freshwater lakes and rivers. However, very rarely, _N. fowleri_ has caused deaths associated with tap or faucet water going up the nose (https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/naegleria/tap-faucet-water.html).

_N. fowleri_ can grow in public and private water tanks and pipes, especially where little or no disinfectant (like chlorine or chloramine) is present. It can also grow in the pipes and water heaters of homes and buildings.

Only 4 out of 143 known infected individuals in the USA between 1962 and 2016 have survived -- a fatality rate over 97 per cent (https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/naegleria/general.html). The morbidity and mortality associated with PAM are likely to increase unless prompt measures to clean water reservoirs in residences and mosques and disinfect water. - Mod.UBA
