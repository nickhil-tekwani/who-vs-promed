Can the common cold help protect you from COVID-19?
---------------------------------------------------
Seasonal colds are by all accounts no fun, but new research suggests the colds you've had in the past may provide some protection from COVID-19. The study, authored by infectious disease experts at the University of Rochester Medical Center [URMC], also suggests that immunity to COVID-19 is likely to last a long time -- maybe even a lifetime.

The study, published in mBio [see ref below], is the first to show that the COVID-19-causing virus, SARS-CoV-2, induces memory B cells, long-lived immune cells that detect pathogens, create antibodies to destroy them and remember them for the future. The next time that pathogen tries to enter the body, those memory B cells can hop into action even faster to clear the infection before it starts. Because memory B cells can survive for decades, they could protect COVID-19 survivors from subsequent infections for a long time, but further research will have to bear that out.

The study is also the first to report cross-reactivity of memory B cells -- meaning B cells that once attacked cold-causing coronaviruses appeared to also recognize SARS-CoV-2. Study authors believe this could mean that anyone who has been infected by a common coronavirus -- which is nearly everyone -- may have some degree of pre-existing immunity to COVID-19.

"When we looked at blood samples from people who were recovering from COVID-19, it looked like many of them had a pre-existing pool of memory B cells that could recognize SARS-CoV-2 and rapidly produce antibodies that could attack it," said lead study author Mark Sangster, research professor of microbiology and immunology at URMC. Sangster's findings are based on a comparison of blood samples from 26 people who were recovering from mild to moderate COVID-19 and 21 healthy donors whose samples were collected 6 to 10 years ago -- long before they could have been exposed to COVID-19. From those samples, study authors measured levels of memory B cells and antibodies that target specific parts of the spike protein, which exists in all coronaviruses and is crucial for helping the viruses infect cells.

The spike protein looks and acts a little different in each coronavirus, but one of its components, the S2 subunit, stays pretty much the same across all of the viruses. Memory B cells can't tell the difference between the spike S2 subunits of the different coronaviruses, and attack indiscriminately. At least, the study found that was true for betacoronaviruses, a subclass that includes two cold-causing viruses as well as SARS, MERS and SARS-CoV-2.

What this study doesn't show is the level of protection provided by cross-reactive memory B cells and how it impacts patient outcomes. "That's next," said David Topham, the Marie Curran Wilson and Joseph Chamberlain Wilson professor of microbiology and immunology at URMC, who runs the lab that conducted this work. "Now we need to see if having this pool of pre-existing memory B cells correlates with milder symptoms and shorter disease course -- or if it helps boost the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines."

Abstract
--------
"The high susceptibility of humans to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), reflects the novelty of the virus and limited preexisting B cell immunity. IgG against the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein, which carries the novel receptor binding domain (RBD), is absent or at low levels in unexposed individuals. To better understand the B cell response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, we asked whether virus-reactive memory B cells (MBCs) were present in unexposed subjects and whether MBC generation accompanied virus-specific IgG production in infected subjects. We analyzed sera and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from non-SARS-CoV-2-exposed healthy donors and COVID-19 convalescent subjects. Serum IgG levels specific for SARS-CoV-2 proteins (S, including the RBD and S2 subunit, and nucleocapsid [N]) and non-SARS-CoV-2 proteins were related to measurements of circulating IgG MBC levels. Anti-RBD IgG was absent in unexposed subjects. Most unexposed subjects had anti-S2 IgG, and a minority had anti-N IgG, but IgG MBCs with these specificities were not detected, perhaps reflecting low frequencies. Convalescent subjects had high levels of IgG against the RBD, S2, and N, together with large populations of RBD- and S2-reactive IgG MBCs. Notably, IgG titers against the S protein of the human coronavirus OC43 were higher in convalescent subjects than in unexposed subjects and correlated strongly with anti-S2 titers. Our findings indicate cross-reactive B cell responses against the S2 subunit that might enhance broad coronavirus protection. Importantly, our demonstration of MBC induction by SARS-CoV-2 infection suggests that a durable form of B cell immunity is maintained even if circulating antibody levels wane.

"Importance
"The recent rapid worldwide spread of SARS-CoV-2 has established a pandemic of potentially serious disease in the highly susceptible human population. Key issues are whether humans have preexisting immune memory that provides some protection against SARS-CoV-2 and whether SARS-CoV-2 infection generates lasting immune protection against reinfection. Our analysis focused on pre- and postinfection IgG and IgG memory B cells (MBCs) reactive to SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Most importantly, we demonstrate that infection generates both IgG and IgG MBCs against the novel receptor binding domain and the conserved S2 subunit of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Thus, even if antibody levels wane, long-lived MBCs remain to mediate rapid antibody production. Our study results also suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection strengthens preexisting broad coronavirus protection through S2-reactive antibody and MBC formation."

This is encouraging news since concern has been high over apparently short-lived immunity following infection and possibly vaccination. The study reports 2 significant findings, 1) that memory B cells are produced against the S2 subunit of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 following infection that might lead to long lasting protection, and 2) this response may be cross-reactive with seasonal coronavirus infections (which cause colds), enhancing broad coronavirus protection. Although the sample size in this study is small, the results are promising. Even with waning circulating antibody, individuals exposed to seasonal coronaviruses or SARS-CoV-2 at an earlier timepoint may have memory B cells which can mediate rapid antibody production. Because young children get colds frequently, that may boost their immunity to SARS-CoV-2, protecting them against severe disease. With schools being closed for months now and children having less exposure to each other, it will be interesting to see if they become more prone to more severe symptoms. - Mod.LK]

-------------------------------------------------------------------
To et al [1] recently reported a case of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection confirmed by genome sequencing. Additional reports of genetically characterized reinfections have emerged [2,3] raising pertinent questions on the longevity of immune response in SARS-CoV-2 infection. In all previous reports, patients had symptoms in one or both of the episodes. Here we report asymptomatic SARS-COV-2 reinfection in 2 healthcare workers detected during routine surveillance. The report highlights the possibility of undetected SARS-CoV-2 reinfections and the need for surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 reinfections in healthcare systems.

We describe 2 individuals, 25 year old male (I1) and 28 year old female (I2) healthcare workers posted in the COVID-19 unit of a tertiary hospital in North India, who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on [5 and 17 May 2020] respectively. Though both individuals were asymptomatic, they were hospitalised as per institutional policy on [5 and 18 May 2020], respectively. Subsequently, they tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR on [13 and 27 May 2020], respectively. After resuming duties in the hospital, the 2 individuals tested positive again for SARS-CoV-2 on [21 Aug and 5 Sep 2020], and further tested negative on the 14th and 6th days respectively. Both individuals were again asymptomatic but had a higher viral load on the 2nd episode of reinfection (CT values of 36 and 16.6 for I1 and 28.16 and 16.92 for I2 for the 1st and 2nd episodes, respectively). The timelines of the 2 episodes of infection in the individuals are summarised in Figure 1A.

Since RNA from the nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swabs were archived, after informed consent (IHEC-CSIR-IGIB/IHEC/2020-21/01) the sequencing-ready libraries were prepared using capturebased (TWIST Biosciences) as well as amplicon-based (COVIDSeq, Illumina) approaches. The libraries were sequenced on 75 bp x 2 paired-end recipe on Illumina MiSeq. Genomes were assembled at an average of 13,684X coverage after merging the datasets, partially covering the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome (NC_045512.2) at 89.08% and 99.96 % respectively for the 2 episodes for I1 and 85.60% and 92.14% for I2. Analysis of the genomes using a previously published protocol [4] for loci covered in both the genomes revealed 9 and 10 unique variant differences between the virus isolates from the 2 episodes of infection for I1 and I2 respectively (Figure 1B). Of the unique variants between the pair of samples, 7 variants each for the 2 individuals mapped to predicted immune epitopes [5].

Taken together our analysis suggests that asymptomatic reinfection may be a potentially underreported entity. Genetically distinct SARS-CoV-2 rules out persistent viral shedding or reactivation. Both individuals had a higher viral load during reinfection highlighting the need for continuous surveillance. It is noteworthy that a genetic variant 22882T>G (S: N440K) found during reinfection in I2 possibly confers resistance to neutralising antibodies [6]. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the earliest reports of genetically characterized reinfection from India.

[References and figure are available at the source URL above. Reports of repeat infection keep appearing -- some are media reports, others, like the above, come from reputable journals. We covered the first report from Hong Kong (see COVID-19 update (325): reinfection, child transm, selected countries, WHO, global 20200720.7592025). A number of reports left open room for speculation that it was a recrudescence of the initial infection with minor changes in the viral genome. The report above has an interval of 3 and 4 months between apparent infections with changes in the viral genomes between 1st and 2nd isolates. Some key questions to be addressed are, what is the duration of immunity from the 1st infection? How frequent is this it occurring? Is this a common event or a sporadic one? And, is there an otherwise not previously identified immunodeficiency in these individuals? - Mod.MPP

The sequencing results do suggest reinfection, but the timing between the initial and the 2nd bouts leave some doubt. I think this question is only going to be resolved in well-designed studies where "obtaining longitudinal serological data where both binding titres and functional neutralization titres are stratified by age groups and previous disease severity status should be undertaken as a matter of urgency. Further, people with low antibody titres after mild disease should be followed up for evidence of reinfection and recurrent disease by regular clinical monitoring and diagnostic virus detection by RT- PCR. If reinfection is detected, serial viral load and measures of antibody status at the time of reinfection should be established. Detailed human immunology characterization and animal studies will be necessary to determine if prior infection leads to an altered disease course if reinfection occurs. It is possible and likely that protective mechanisms through other arms of the immune response (memory and cytotoxic T cells) alter the COVID-19 disease course upon reinfection either by diminishing symptoms in the absence of protective antibodies or by enhancing infection at the nadir of the humoral immune response by sub- neutralizing antibody titres. It is also unclear if reinfections will result in onward transmission, but that cannot be excluded."

The situation report includes information provided by national authorities as of 10 am CEST, 4 Oct 2020

Global epidemiological situation
--------------------------------
The number of new cases per week has remained stable at 2 million for the past 3 weeks (Figure 1), with a cumulative total of over 34.8 million cases. Over 1 million deaths have now been reported globally, of which the majority have been reported in the Region of the Americas (55%), followed by Europe (23%). In the past week, the regions of the Americas, South East Asia, and Europe account for 91% of new cases. 5 countries (namely India, the United States of America, Brazil, Argentina, and France) reported 60% of new global cases this past week, while Israel registered the highest incidence (3717 new cases per 1 million population). Globally, the highest percentage of cases have been reported in the 25-39 age group, with approximately 50% of cases in the 25-64 age group. However, the percentage of deaths increases with age, and approximately 75% of deaths are in those aged 65 years and above.

Figure 1: Number of COVID-19 cases reported weekly by WHO Region, and global deaths, [30 Dec 2019] through [4 Oct 2020]

Although globally the number of new cases was similar to the number of cases in the previous week, there is considerable variation on a country- by-country basis. In several countries, the number of new cases is rising again, and in many (most notably within the European Region) the 2nd wave is exceeding previous peaks; this can be partly attributed to enhancements in surveillance capacities over time. In other countries we have seen a gradual decline in new cases from earlier peaks in August [2020], for example in Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. In India and the Philippines, the number of new cases appear to have stabilized, but they are still reporting high numbers. There are also examples of countries that have consistently shown an increasing incidence as their 1st wave continues; these include Indonesia, Iraq, and Myanmar, although Indonesia is reporting a slight drop this week. South Africa and Australia are examples of countries that have successfully managed to reduce the number of new cases and have seen large reductions from earlier peaks.

Situation by WHO region
-----------------------
- African Region
South Africa and Ethiopia continue to report the highest numbers of new cases in Africa, followed by Mozambique, Uganda, and Nigeria. Africa has seen a continuous decline in case incidence since mid-July [2020]; however, this trend is now slowing (Figure 3). For the 1st week since early August [2020], the number of new deaths has risen -- led by South Africa with a 29% increase in deaths in the past week.

South Africa also has the 2nd-highest mortality rate in the Region -- 11 461 deaths per 1 million population. The provinces of Gauteng and the Western Cape have reported the most cases and deaths to date; however, these regions, as well as the country itself, have maintained sustained declines in the daily incidence since the end of July [2020]. Despite this, weekly case numbers have continued to rise in less populated provinces. The country moved to Alert Level 1 as of [21 Sep 2020] (the least stringent of the 5 alert levels applied by the South African Government), with all sectors of the economy now open with strict adherence to public health protocols. A WHO surge team of experts, including infectious disease specialists and epidemiologists, is currently in South Africa, and is continuing to work with the National Department of Health.

New weekly cases have risen in Angola from 400 in the week of [7 Sep 2020] to 698 cases in the past week, a 74% increase, although the number of new cases has declined by 10% from the past week. Angola recently upgraded their self-reported transmission classification from 'clusters of cases' to 'community transmission'. Luanda province remains the epicentre with around 90% of all cases. A total of 16 out of the 18 provinces have reported confirmed cases. WHO has trained around 90 community health mobilizers now operating across Luanda.

Figure 3: Number of COVID-19 cases and deaths reported weekly by the WHO African Region, as of [4 Oct 2020]

- Region of the Americas
A similar incidence of new cases was reported across the Region over the past week (Figure 4) in comparison to previous week. The USA, Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, Mexico, and Peru registered the highest number of weekly new cases.

The USA continues to record about 300 000 new cases per week (894 new cases per 1 million population). Declines observed over July [2020] and August [2020] have stagnated in recent weeks, with several states reporting sharp rises in case numbers -- most notably in Midwestern states. Canada is also showing a large increase in new cases and new deaths compared with last week, at 43% and 208% respectively. Likewise, Argentina continues to report an increase in cases and deaths, with cumulative deaths exceeding 20 000 last week after a backlog of over 3000 reported deaths from Buenos Aires. Since peaking at just over 300 000 new weekly cases in the week of [27 Jul 2020], new cases in Brazil have fallen to 190 000 new cases in the past week (898 new cases per 1 million population). Weekly new cases have also fallen in Colombia and Peru.

In the Region of the Americas, as in other Regions, older people are far more likely to experience severe disease following infection. Brazil reported that 76% of COVID-19 related deaths during February to September 2020 were in adults aged 60 years and older. In Peru, people over the age of 70 years had the highest COVID-19 mortality rates during March-May 2020 and estimates from Canada show that more than 80% of COVID-19 deaths have occurred in long-term-care facilities. WHO has published guidance on preventing and managing COVID-19 across long-term care services [https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-Policy_Brief-Long-term_Care-2020.1] with an annex [https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-Policy_Brief-Long-term_Care-web-annex-2020.1] providing a comprehensive set of actions for policymakers, national, and local decision-makers and other actors.

Figure 4: Number of COVID-19 cases and deaths reported weekly by the WHO Region of the Americas, as of [4 Oct 2020]

- Eastern Mediterranean Region
A similar incidence of new cases was reported from the Eastern Mediterranean Region over the past week (Figure 5) in comparison to previous week. Iraq, Iran, Morocco, and Lebanon are reporting the highest numbers of new cases for the past week. Iraq has reported over 20 000 cases per week since the beginning of August and this week just under 30 000 cases new cases (745 cases per 1 million population) were reported. In Jordan, case incidence has almost doubled each week for the past 5 weeks, with over 6600 new cases (a 90% increase on the previous week) reported last week.

Since the start of September [2020], the Islamic Republic of Iran has shown an upward trend in weekly new cases and is reporting their highest number of new cases -- 25 000 new cases (298 cases per 1 million population) -- since the beginning of the pandemic.

Lebanon reported a 19% increase in new cases compared with the previous week and has one of the highest rates of new cases in the Region (1209 new cases per 1 million population). On [29 Sep 2020], WHO also launched an initiative to rebuild the Ministry of Public Health's Central Drug Warehouse in Qarantina, Lebanon, which was destroyed by the Beirut port blast on [4 Aug 2020].

Figure 5: Number of COVID-19 cases and deaths reported weekly by the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region, as of [4 Oct 2020]

- European Region
The incidence of new cases has continued to increase in the European Region overall (Figure 6). France, the Russian Federation, the United Kingdom, Spain, and Israel reported the highest numbers of new cases in the past week. The numbers of new cases and new deaths in the Russian Federation, the UK, Ukraine, and several other countries in Europe are showing considerable increases compared with last week. The Netherlands, Czechia, Germany, and Italy have also reported sizable increases. Israel continues to have the highest incidence of new cases per 1 million population in the Region and globally, with over 32 000 cases reported in the past week (3717 new cases per 1 million population).

With over 1.2 million COVID-19 cases, and over 63 000 new cases in the past week (436 cases per 1 million population), the Russia Federation is reporting the 2nd highest number of new cases in Europe and the 6th highest number globally. Russia's weekly new cases peaked at 75 000 cases in the week of 4 May [2020], with a gradual decrease observed through late August [2020], but rapid increases observed in the last 3 weeks.

In contrast to other European countries, Ukraine did not observe a large 1st peak, but has reported a continuous increase in new cases since mid-June [2020]. Over 27 000 new cases were reported in the past week (636 new cases per 1 million population), a 21% rise from the week before. Since the start of the outbreak, WHO has supported the Ministry of Health to further develop 3 key areas of its health system: health financing, service delivery, and governance. In September [2020], WHO experts worked together with national authorities to make sure rehabilitation services are fully functional and well-integrated into health care.

Figure 6: Number of COVID-19 cases and deaths reported weekly by the WHO European Region, as of [4 Oct 2020]

- South East Asia Region
A gradual decline in case and deaths incidence in the South East Asia Region continued during the past week (Figure 7). Nevertheless, the Region contributes almost a 3rd (n=614 502, 30%) of new cases reported global in the past week. At the same time, current weekly case incidence (304 per 1 million population) is markedly lower than that which is currently observed in the Americas and Europe.

Figure 7: Number of COVID-19 cases and deaths reported weekly by the WHO South East Asia Region, as of [4 Oct 2020]

India, reporting over 500 000 new cases per week since late-August [2020], again contributed the majority of incident cases in the Region (91%) and globally (27%) last week, bringing cumulative counts in the country to an excess of 6.5 million cases and 100 000 deaths (10% of the global total). Over several months, case numbers in India rose rapidly, with Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, and Uttar Pradesh reporting the highest numbers of cases. This increase occurred with a concurrent expansion in testing activity, which has since stabilized at 7-8 million samples tested per week (or 5.2- 5.8 samples tested/1000 persons/week) in the past 5 weeks. Weekly incidence of new cases is gradually easing, falling to 403 new cases per 1 million population (556 841 cases) this past week, after peaking 3 weeks ago, while test positivity rates fell marginally to 7.1%.

Indonesia is currently the 2nd most affected country in the Region, nearing 300 000 cases to date, including over 28 000 new cases (or 103 new cases per 1 million population) in the past week. Almost 60% of cases to date have been reported from the island of Java, which includes the capital Jakarta. Suspected case numbers have risen sharply in recent weeks; however, testing capacity has thus far been unable to meet demand, with approximately 23% (n=30 940 people) people tested among some 132 000 suspected cases reported on [30 Sep 2020]. Among 4 provinces that achieved a benchmark of 1 person tested/1000 population/week during September [2020], weekly test positivity rates ranged markedly from less than 5% to over 40%, highlighting the heterogeneity in both surveillance capacity and COVID19 activities across the island.

In Myanmar, COVID-19 incidence has risen sharply, with cumulative counts almost doubling each week since mid-August [2020], and over 6500 new cases (or 120 new cases per 1 million population) reported in the past week. Rakhine State and the country's largest city, Yangon has reported around 75% of cases, and has been hardest hit to date, with a possibility of community transmission in areas. On [20 Sep 2020], Myanmar announced a stay-home order for its biggest city Yangon.

- Western Pacific Region
In the Western Pacific Region, the weekly number of new cases reported continues to fluctuate (Figure 8). The Philippines, Japan, and Malaysia are reporting the highest numbers of new cases, with Malaysia reporting an increase of 119% in new cases compared with last week.

Figure 8: Number of COVID-19 cases and deaths reported weekly by the WHO Western Pacific Region, data as of [4 Oct 2020]

Around 3/4 (73%) of new cases in the region were from the Philippines. Although weekly new cases in the Philippines peaked in the week of [10 Aug 2020], the incidence of new cases remains relatively high compared to others in the Region, with over 18 000 new cases in the past week (165 cases per 1 million population). Data as of [29 Sep 2020] shows that 50% of cases are in the age group 20-39 years, while 60% of deaths are in those aged 60 years and over. There is community transmission in all regions of the country, with 3 regions -- National Capital Region, Region 3, and Region 4A -- showing higher transmission intensity. The National Capital Region continues to report the most cases, with half of national cases, where Metro Manila mayors have recommended the extension of the general community quarantine status for the month of October [2020].

In Malaysia, the weekly number of new cases has been increasing for the past 3 weeks, with 1319 cases reported in the past week (40 new cases per 1 million population). The state of Sabah has been the worst affected in recent weeks, accounting for 77% of cases reported in September [2020]. A number of clusters in other states have also been linked to travellers from Sabah. Malaysia has a nationwide recovery movement control order (RMCO) in place and most communities and services are operating under these limited restrictions. However, targeted enhanced movement control orders (TEMCO), the most stringent form of community and business restrictions, have been implemented in a number of areas with high levels of community transmission.

The Solomon Islands recorded their 1st COVID-19 case: a student returning from the Philippines on a repatriation flight. The Solomon Islands have planned to use repatriation flights to return students studying in the Philippines and Indonesia. Since early January 2020, WHO has been working closely alongside Pacific Governments and Ministries of Health, in collaboration with partners, to ensure that countries are well prepared to respond to the threat of COVID-19.

[There were no cases reported from Mexico and Sweden in the past 24 hours.

The USA and India are still the most severely affected countries in terms of cumulative case counts and daily new case confirmations, with India in the 2nd position in terms of cumulative case counts and dominating in terms of newly reported cases. In the past 24 hours, these 2 countries -- India (59 893), followed by the USA (42 732) maintained their dominance, although there was an almost 20 000 decrease in reported cases from India in the past 24 hours, compared with the preceding 24 hours. A global total of 4140 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (4-5 Oct 2020).

Countries reporting more than 5000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours (10 countries) include India, USA, Spain (42 031), Brazil (25 210), UK (12 593), Argentina (11 242), Russia (10 888), Colombia (7106), Israel (5534), and France (5084). A total of 33 countries have reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 15 of the 33 countries reporting more than 1000 newly confirmed cases are from the European region, and 8 were from the Americas region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, there is an increase in case counts by 4.0%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 6.8%.

Impression: Global 7 day averages have increased with reports from the past 24 hours -- in some cases, countries had not reported cases in over 48 hours (Spain). There is still an apparent decline, somewhat unexplained in reports from India, and while Brazil has rebounded from the 8000+ cases reported yesterday (4 Oct 2020), it still is markedly lower than previous reports. I usually use look at reports on Thursday as an indicator of the trends, having cleared the previous weekend reporting artifacts, and not starting the coming weekend's reduced reporting. - Mod.MPP]
