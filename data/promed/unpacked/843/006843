I regret that the probability of finding a husband and wife case of CJD is
not anywhere near as remote as people might imagine. The analysis is closely
related to that which shows that in a class of 30 children the probability
of two having the same birthday is about 50%.
A simplified analysis suggests that the probability for a husband and wife
case to have occurred in the last 20 years is about 30%.
A short analysis follows:
DATA:
1) The incidence of sporadic CJD in the WHOLE population is about 1 in 10^6
per person year.
2) The population of the US is about 250x10^6. However since this would be
notable anywhere with believable medical facilities the proper population to
consider is probably in excess of 500x10^6.
3) Sporadic CJD is largely confined to older people, typically aged 60-70.
4) One ought to consider a time period of about 20 years of surveillance ie
this case is effectively a 1 in 20 years occurrance.
LOGIC:
a) From 1 & 2 one deduces that the total number of natural CJD cases is
about 500 per year for the relevant population. In that case over a 20 year
period one expects 10,000 cases.
b) One might estimate that the at risk population is about 20% of the
overall population or about 100M people (i.e. those between 60 & 70).
c) So the chance that any one of the at risk population contracting CJD is
about 10,000:100M or 1:10,000.
d) As I see it this is equivalent to rolling *two* (one husband and one
wife) 10,000 sided dice 50M times and getting at least one pair showing both
"1"'s.
Just to be sure I had the calculation checked by someone more familiar with
this than I (it requires a small mathematical trick to evaluate it). I quote
him:
====================
The probability of a "positive" result (both 1's) if you roll a pair of such
dice once is 1/(10,000 x 10,000), or 10^(-8). So the probability of a
negative result is 1-10^(-8), or 0.99999999. If you repeat the experiment
5x10^7 times, the probability
of getting a negative result every time is
P = (0.99999999)^(5x10^7) = 0.607
So the probability of at least one positive result is 1 - 0.607, or almost
30%.
[NB The evaluation is done using the approximation (x small):
[P = (1-x)^N = [(1-x)^(1/x)^(N x), here x=10^(-8), N=5x10^7
For small x, (1-x)^(1/x) ~= 1/e, so P ~= e^(-N x) = e^(-1/2) ~ 0.6
====================
Note that in this case we are talking about husbands and wives. We might
equally have talked about lifetime good friends, people who worked next to
each other, lived next door to each other or a whole host of possible 'close
associations' that LOOK implausible. If there are 100 such 'implausible'
associations one ought to expect one at regular intervals.

ASSUMPTIONS:
1. 1:1,000,000 incidence per general pop per year. Check.
2. All caused by a narrower window of reported population, say 1:5 falling
in the range of > 45+ years. Check.
3. Reporting general population: 500,000,000. (Actually, probably more like
600,000,000. But whose quibbling?)
Probability of CJD per person per yr in reporting population:
5:1,000,000 = 1:200,000
Expected number of cases annually:
500,000,000 x 1/1,000,000 = 500
(500,000,000/5) x 1/200,000 = 500 (check.)
Consider now spousal pairs:
x = 1/200,000 = 0.000005 = expected spouse CJD rate
y=500 x 0.000005 = 0.0025 = annual joint CJD rate
If we say we're looking for such a pair in a 20-year period, we would expect
20 x 0.25% = 0.05 pairs in such a period. The probability of observing at
least 1 such pair is 1 - exp(-.05) = 4.9%. The chance of two such pairs is
1:827. This is a far cry from my small number, but it's still not high.
Particularly when you factor in the dying within 5 years of each other, as
all 2-3 reported spousal pairs have done.
If you then factor in a possible 10x higher discovery rate in spouses, given
the prior CJD case, then
x = 1/20,000 = 0.00005
y = 0.025
and the expected number of spousal pairs in 20 yrs of observation becomes
0.5. The chance of observing such pairs in 20 years is then:
n 0 1 2 3 4
Pr 60.7% 30.3% 7.6% 1.3% 0.2%
So I stand chastised in that the probability of a such pairs being observed
is not so small as to be impossible.
We have all apparently also forgotten the facts that 1) 15% of all CJD
reported is familial; 2) CJD strikes at a distribution of ages from 30 to
80, not just to a narrow band from 60-70, as Oz suggests. In consequence,
the occurrence of spousal CJD pairs would be mainly suggestive of marriage
within a limited gene pool group rather than an as yet undiscovered cause,
particularly when they occur at closely similar ages.

A couple of pertinent references on CJD clustering:
Ann Neurol 1979 Feb;5(2):177-188
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease: patterns of worldwide occurrence and the
significance of familial and sporadic clustering. Masters CL, Harris JO,
Gajdusek DC, Gibbs CJ Jr, Bernoulli C, Asher DM
The worldwide epidemiology of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is presented
from
an analysis of 1,435 patients. In the United States, the average annual
mortality rate is at least 0.26 deaths per million. Temporal-spatial
clustering of cases was not found in the United States, but reports from
other countries indicate that such clustering does occur. Fifteen percent of
the cases were of the familial type, suggesting a genetic susceptibility to
infection.
Iatrogenic transmission by corneal transplantation and neurosurgical
operations has occurred, and the possibility is raised that previous surgery
or preexisting neurological disease may be associated with an increased risk
of developing CJD. It remains to be determined whether the virus of CJD is
maintained only by patient-to-patient transmission, has a zoonotic reservoir
such as scrapie, or causes widespread latent infection of man that is
occasionally activated.

Brain 1981 Sep;104(3):535-558
The familial occurrence of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and Alzheimer's
disease. Masters CL, Gajdusek DC, Gibbs CJ Jr
We have analysed the familial occurrence of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD)
in 27 families selected from a total of 73 families. Fifteen per cent of all
cases of CJD have a family history of disease consistent with autosomal
dominant transmission. The onset of disease in familial cases is
significantly earlier than in sporadic cases. A maternal effect was not
found, nor was there evidence for prenatal vertical transmission of the
virus. Temporal and spatial separations between affected members
demonstrates that incubation periods ranging at least from one to four
decades are to be expected. Affected siblings tend to die at the same age,
and not at the same time, which is consistent with some form of vertical
transmission (either prenatal or early postnatal), assuming rather uniform
incubation periods.
CJD occurred in four families in members related by marriage, evidence in
favour of horizontal or common source transmission in occasional cases.
The familial occurrence of CJD and Alzheimer's disease (AD) were compared
using data on 52 families with AD. The age at death and duration of disease
in familial AD is greater than in familial CJD. Familial AD also occurs in a
pattern of autosomal dominant transmission, without maternal effect. There
were four families with AD in which one or more members died from CJD. There
were an additional 17 families with AD in which one or more members
presented with clinical features resembling CJD.

Although virus causing an experimental spongiform encephalopathy was
isolated from the brain of two cases of familial AD, most cases of sporadic
and familial AD tested failed to cause disease when brain tissue was
inoculated into nonhuman primates. The precise mechanism of spread of the
virus in familial CJD remains unknown. The results of the present study are
consistent with the hypothesis of a genetically inherited susceptibility to
infection which is acquired in early infancy or childhood. Other proposed
mechanisms such as prenatal vertical transmission or a common environmental
source of infection seem less likely.
