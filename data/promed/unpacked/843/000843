Aeromonas hydrophila? fish, Indonesia query
-------------------------------------------
I agree that _Aeromonas hydrophila_ is an opportunistic pathogen of
fish. What concerns me is the statement that it cannot survive
temperatures of over 30 degrees Celsius. I routinely culture it at
growth temperatures of between 35 - 37 degrees Celsius.
_A.hydrophila_ is ubiquitous and is found in all natural waters,
especially in the sludge of ponds. It usually proliferates when the
water temperature is high and is not considered to be an obligate
parasite of fish.
_Aeromonas salmonicida_ (there are 4 subspecies) on the other hand is
psychrophilic, preferring to grow at temperatures of 18 - 25 degrees
Celsius and is carried in the gills, kidneys, and intestinal tracts
of healthy fish. It is considered to be an obligate parasite of fish,
which (if in low numbers) does not survive in the environment for
longer than 72 hours. It is the agent of furunculosis in trout,
ulcers in goldfish, erythrodermatitis of common carp, and systemic
infections of several warm water and marine species.
