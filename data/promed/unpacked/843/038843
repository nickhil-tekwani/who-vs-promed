Health officials are bracing themselves for a surge in the number of dengue
cases as the disease claimed 9 lives, all children, in the region from
January to April 2005. The dengue virus has affected more than 540
residents so far, an increase from 2004's 303 cases, 2 of which resulted in
death. The Regional Epidemiology and Surveillance Unit [RESU] said 2005's
fatalities were children ages 1 to 9 years old.
Reynan Cimafranca, Nurse-2 of RESU, said that because of water scarcity,
especially in the mountain barangays, some people tend to store water in
lidless containers that could be breeding sites for mosquitoes. "We are
anticipating the number of cases will continue to increase because of the
dry spells. We observed that it is during the dry season when cases go up,
especially in the rural areas where water is scarce," Cimafranca said. If
there is a need to store water, he urged the public to cover their
containers so as not to create a breeding site for the mosquitoes.
It was during the El Ni phenomenon in 1998 and 1999 when Central Visayas
experienced a dengue outbreak. While Cebu residents are already aware about
the preventive measures to counter the dengue virus, he lamented the
community is sometimes lax in implementing them.

[The Philippines has experienced a dramatic increase (78 per cent) in
dengue fever infections from Jan to Apr 2005 compared with the same period
of 2004. The 2 deaths from the outbreak were both children. According to
the local health authorities, children aged 1 to 9 years are predicted to
suffer most from this surge of dengue fever and dengue haemorrhagic fever.
The shortage of water seems to aggravate the situation, in that lidless
water containers are likely to serve as breeding grounds for mosquitoes. -

Dengue fever has now spread to 20 provinces in southern Vietnam with a
total of 6290 cases so far, including 3 deaths, reported the Ho Chi Minh
City Pasteur Institute Friday. Ho Chi Minh City has the most patients
infected with the disease followed by An Giang province with 714 cases.
The disease is also present in Tien Giang province with 664 cases, Dong
Thap province with 577 cases, Soc Trang province with 537 cases, Can Tho
city with 411 cases and Hau Giang province with 203 cases including one death.
Although the number of victims is smaller than in 2004, the tropical fever
transmitted by mosquitoes is now on the rise. Within a week from April 11
to 17, there were 70 new patients in Soc Trang and 52 new patients in Dong
Thap. At the same time, An Giang reported 46 more patients and Ben Tre
received 33 new patients. The best way to prevent dengue fever is to reduce
the mosquito population and their larvae.

[The current number of victims (6290) seems to be slightly lower than at
this time in 2004, but the trend does not seem to be decreasing. No data
were available on the percentage of mosquitoes infected with dengue virus.
3 deaths have claimed by dengue hemorrhagic fever so far. - Mod.RY]

The Thai Red Cross Society today appealed for urgent donations of Group B
blood to cope with the emergence of a new strain of dengue haemorrhagic
fever. In a statement released this morning, the Thai Red Cross Society
said that dengue fever patients in Ramathibodi Hospital required 40 units
of blood each day, equivalent to the blood from 40 donors.
However, with no Group B blood in its reserves, the hospital is in
desperate need of new donors.The hospital is also said to be facing
shortages of blood from other groups.Donors are being urged to contact the
Thai Red Cross Society and can arrange for donations each day of the week.

The Centre for Health Protection has confirmed an imported case of Dengue
fever involving a 27 year old woman who developed fever, bone pain and
headache on 9 Feb 2005.
It brings 2005's total number of Dengue fever cases to 6, all imported. The
woman had been in Indonesia 3-17 Feb 2005. She was admitted to United
Christian Hospital on 19 Feb for 6 days and has recovered. The patient's
family contacts have no symptoms of the disease.
The centre reminds the public to take the following preventive measures:
- put all used cans and bottles into dustbins with covers;
- change water for plants at least once a week, leaving no water in the
saucers underneath flower pots;
- cover tightly all water containers, wells and water storage tanks; and
- keep all drains free from blockage.
Travellers are urged to wear long-sleeved tops and trousers, use insect
repellent and mosquito screens or nets. Anyone feeling unwell after
returning from their trip should consult a doctor as soon as possible and
provide details of their travel to the doctor. For the latest information
