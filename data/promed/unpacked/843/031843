On 30 Mar 2021, the Animal and Plant Health Service (APHIS), Veterinary Services'(VS), National Veterinary Services Laboratories, Foreign Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory (NVSL-FADDL) reported a detection of Rabbit Hemorrhagic Disease Virus Type 2 (RHDV2) in one domestic rabbit in Poinsett County, Arkansas. NVSL-FADDL notified the Arkansas State Animal Health Official and Department of Agriculture, which initiated appropriate disease response activities.

On 7 Apr 2021, ancillary testing and review of other diagnostic cases revealed a significant laboratory error, resulting in the Arkansas case being incorrectly reported as positive. VS leadership immediately notified the Arkansas State Animal Health Official that the case was negative, and corrective action reports were initiated.

APHIS-VSNVSL terribly regrets this error and has taken corrective action to ensure this does not happen again in the future.

Sincerely,
Burke L. Healey, DVM
Deputy Administrator

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
U. S. Department of Agriculture Retracts Notification of Rabbit Hemorrhagic Disease in Arkansas

The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) has contacted the Arkansas Department of Agriculture to report a significant error at their Foreign Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory on a previously reported finding of rabbit hemorrhagic disease in Arkansas.

On 30 Mar 2021, the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Service (APHIS), Veterinary Services' (VS), National Veterinary Services Laboratories, Foreign Animal Disease Laboratory (NVSL-FADDL) reported a detection of Rabbit Hemorrhagic Disease Virus Type 2 (RHDV2) in one domestic rabbit in northeast Arkansas. NVSL-FADDL notified the Arkansas State Animal Health Official and the Arkansas Department of Agriculture, which initiated the appropriate disease response activities. The Department has received notification from the NVSL-FADDL that ancillary testing and review of other diagnostic cases revealed an error which led to the previously reported positive finding.

The Department is currently working to notify the appropriate rabbit and veterinarian communities. A copy of the notification from APHIS can be found at https://www.agriculture.arkansas.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/USDA-Letter-of-Retraction-of-RHD-Positive-Finding-in-Arkansas.pdf.

[Although these 2 articles are similar, and both are posted by Arkansas, one is from the USDA to the state, and the other is from the state to its public.

This is a tremendous error on the part of the USDA. Sadly, and unfortunately, the rabbit producers who were notified of the disease may have already been forced to depopulate. A diagnosis like this is devastating to producers and a cost to the state to depopulate the affected premises.

We hope the rabbits are still living and that the producers have suffered nothing more than anxiety. - Mod.TG
