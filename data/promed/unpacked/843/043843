Salmonella outbreak called worst since 1985
------------------------------------------
Lake County health officials Wed night, 6 Aug 2003 confirmed 163 victims of
salmonella poisoning from the recent outbreak at a Vernon Hills restaurant
including 27 restaurant workers, or 32 percent of the eatery's work force.
In a report to the Board of Health, health department staff members
detailed the extent of the epidemic. They said there still are 43 people
with probable cases. Those people had been in close contact with infected
persons and are now showing symptoms compatible with salmonella.
[Salmonellosis, because of a relatively high infectious dose, does not
readily spread from person to person unless there is a food vehicle as an
'intermediary' - Mod.LL]
There are also 93 other possible cases involving people who claim to have
eaten at the restaurant during the critical time period in late June 2003.
"This is probably the largest salmonella outbreak in Lake County since the
great milk salmonella outbreak in 1985," said Bill Mays, health department
director of community health services. The 1985 epidemic stemmed from the
mixing of raw milk with pasteurized milk in a dairy. That infected 400 000
people in the Midwest area, Mays said.
In this [particular restaurant's] case, management "made some poor and
unacceptable mistakes," health department Executive Director Dale Galassie
said. At one point, the restaurant operated for almost 2 hours with no
water, which was a conscious management decision, he said.
Officials said the epidemic was contained before it could spread to 18
other food establishments that were at risk. Those places were at risk
because some of those infected, including some customers and several [of
the restaurant] employees, worked at other area restaurants.
Mays said the quick response of health workers and the prompt closing of
the restaurant after the first positive case was confirmed 31 Jun 2003
averted a potential "nightmare." [The affected restaurant] remained closed
1-10 Jul 2003 and then reopened after passing an inspection.
