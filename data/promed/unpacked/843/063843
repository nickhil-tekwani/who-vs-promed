Disease could cause cassava production to plummet by 50 percent
---------------------------------------------------------------
Cassava experts are warning that the rapidly proliferating cassava brown streak virus [CBSD] could cause a 50 percent drop in production of a crop that provides a significant source of food and income for 300 million Africans.

There have been recent reports of new outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of the Congo -- the world's 3rd largest cassava producer -- and Angola, where production has boomed in recent years. The spread of the disease to West Africa and particularly Nigeria is a major cause for concern, because the country now produces 50 million tons of cassava each year and has made a big bet on cassava for its agricultural and industrial development.

The "pandemic" of CBSD now underway is particularly worrisome because agriculture experts have been looking to the otherwise resilient cassava plant for helping to feed a continent. Rising temperatures now appear to be one of several factors causing an explosion in whiteflies, which carry the viruses that cause CBSD and CMD [cassava mosaic disease]. Scientists also think that genetic changes have led to the emergence of "super" whiteflies.

In Italy this week a conference [is being held] dedicated to "declaring war on cassava viruses in Africa." The experts will also discuss how to eradicate cassava viruses altogether. The aim will be to develop a bold regional strategy to replace farmers' existing cassava with virus-free planting material of the most resistant available cultivars.

[Cassava brown streak (or root rot) disease can be caused by _Cassava brown streak virus_ (CBSV; genus _Ipomovirus_) and the more recently identified _Ugandan cassava brown streak virus_. It is considered a threat to the whole of sub-Saharan Africa, where the crop is a major factor in food security. Symptoms may include leaf chlorosis, stem necrosis, and yellow/brown corky necrosis in the starch bearing tissue of roots. Leaves may appear healthy even when the roots have rotted away. Total crop losses of 20-80 percent have been reported, and losses in individual root weight of up to 70 percent have been observed in susceptible cultivars.

The virus is transmitted by the whitefly vector _Bemisia tabaci_ and is spread to new areas by infected cassava cuttings. Disease management includes pathogen exclusion, removal of infected plants, use of virus-free seed tubers for planting, and vector control, but these measures may be difficult to implement in developing countries. Resistant varieties are being developed for specific local requirements.

CBSV is a particular threat to new varieties developed with resistance to Cassava mosaic disease (CMD; caused by a number of species and strains in the genus _Begomovirus_ and transmitted like CBSV). A new CBSV strain adapted to higher altitudes has emerged and is affecting additional CMD resistant cultivars (ProMED-mail posts 20100525.1735 and 20120706.1191742).

The new outbreaks reported above now appear to indicate a westward spread of the viruses. Joint management of both diseases has become a major challenge in the region and globally (ProMED-mail post 20110829.2643) since development of crop varieties with stable resistance to multiple viruses is particularly difficult (ProMED-mail post 20090709.2463).
