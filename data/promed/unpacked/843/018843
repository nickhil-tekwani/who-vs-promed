Virgin Islands Agriculture Department's Errol Chichester said this
[2011] was a very poor year for mangoes due to the rainy weather the
island [St Croix] has been experiencing for 2 months. "The flowers and
fruits dropped due to the rain and the fruits are not as sweet," he
said.

Anthracnose, a fungal disease that causes black spots and streaks in
mangoes and other fruits, also affected the crop this year [2011],
Chichester said.

[Anthracnose is considered the most important disease of mango. It is
caused by the fungi _Glomerella cingulata_ (previously _Colletotrichum
gloeosporioides_) or _C. acutatum_. Symptoms may include flower
blight, pre- and post-harvest fruit rot, twig dieback, and leaf spots.
Anthracnose can completely destroy the flowers and cause extensive
dead areas on leaves, greatly reducing yield. The fungi apparently
invade the skin of young fruit and remain in a latent state until
fruit ripening begins. Ripe fruit, either before or after picking, can
then develop prominent dark-brown to black spots. Fruit infection
commonly occurs and can result in extensive rotting.

The fungi have a long saprophytic survival ability on dead twigs and
fallen leaves. These are the main sources of inoculum and spread may
occur with infected plant material, by mechanical means (including
insect activities) and water splash. The disease is favoured by humid
conditions during the period from the onset of flowering until fruit
are about half size. Control of anthracnose in mango usually centers
on a diligent fungicide programme, but may also include
phytosanitation to reduce inoculum and cultural measures to reduce
moisture in the orchard. More Indo-Chinese/Philippine type mango
varieties show levels of resistance to anthracnose than Indian type
varieties.

_Glomerella cingulata_ and related species have been reported to
cause anthracnose-like symptoms on many crops.
