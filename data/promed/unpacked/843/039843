A plague spread by rats [via their fleas] has killed 39 people in recent weeks in Madagascar, the health ministry said Thursday, 12 Dec 2013. "There is an epidemic in Madagascar which is currently affecting 5 districts (out of 112). 86 people have been afflicted by the illness, of which 39 have died," said the ministry in a statement read to AFP.

A doctor in the ministry in Antananarivo said 90 percent of the cases were diagnosed as pneumonic plague, a lethal form, which can kill within 3 days, leaving little time for antimicrobials to work.

The 1st person died before November 2013 but government only officially declared the existence of a plague on 23 Nov 2013. According to the doctor, who cannot be named because he does not have clearance to speak to the media, the 1st case was registered in a village in the remote [district] of Mandritsara [Sofia region].

Affected districts are in the north, northeast, southeast and the center of the island nation.

[Most cases of plague are due to bubonic plague following the bite of an infected rodent flea causing a swollen and very tender lymph gland. The swollen gland is called a "bubo." Bubonic plague should be suspected when a person develops a swollen gland, fever, chills, headache, and extreme exhaustion, and has a history of possible exposure to infected rodents, rabbits, or fleas. A person usually becomes ill with bubonic plague 2 to 6 days after being bitten.

When bubonic plague is left untreated, plague bacteria invade the bloodstream. As the plague bacteria multiply in the bloodstream, they spread rapidly throughout the body and cause a severe and often fatal condition. Infection of the lungs with the plague bacterium causes the pneumonic form of plague, a severe respiratory illness. The infected person may experience high fever, chills, cough, and breathing difficulty and may produce bloody sputum. If plague patients are not given specific antibiotic therapy, the disease can progress rapidly to death. At this stage, as appears to have happened in this outbreak, person-to-person spread can occur, causing other cases of "primary" plague pneumonia. - Mod.LL
