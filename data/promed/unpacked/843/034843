Avian influenza situation in Indonesia: update 5
------------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health of Indonesia has announced a new case of human
infection of H5N1 avian influenza. A 21-year-old female from Bandung
City, West Java Province developed symptoms on 14 Dec 2010, was
hospitalized on 22 Nov 2010, and is currently in hospital.

Initial investigations indicate the case resided in an area close to
a business where chickens were kept and the area was found to be
lacking cleanliness with chicken droppings present. Additional
investigations on the possible source of infections are being
undertaken.

Laboratory tests have confirmed infection with the H5N1 avian
influenza virus. Of the 171 cases confirmed to date in Indonesia, 141
have been fatal.
