CDC changes anthrax vaccine recommendations
-------------------------------------------
New details have been released by the US Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention concerning recommendations made in February [2010] by
its vaccine advisory group about Americans receiving anthrax shots.

The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices's [ACIP] report
outlines 5 changes to the administration of anthrax vaccines, 2 of
which had previously been announced in a February report.

Among the previously announced recommendations were changes to the
number of initial doses from 6 to 5 and a change to the administration
route from subcutaneous to intramuscular.

These 2 changes arose from results revealed during ongoing clinical
trials that are meant to gauge the ability to reduce the long
immunization series and side effects.

The 3 new recommendations, CIDRAP [Center for Infectious Disease
Research & Policy] News reports, provide guidance on preexposure
vaccination for emergency workers and 1st responders, recommend
BioThrax as part of postexposure prophylaxis in pregnant women, and 60
days of antibiotic prophylaxis combined with 3 doses of BioThrax for
optimal postexposure protection of unvaccinated people.

The recommendation for pregnant women to receive BioThrax follows a
recent study of military women who were inadvertently vaccinated while
pregnant. Pregnant women are currently exempted from anthrax
vaccination by a Department of Defense policy.

According to the study, CIDRAP News reports, women who received the
vaccine during their 1st trimester carried a slightly higher risk of
birth defects; however, when the 1st-trimester group was compared with
women vaccinated outside of the 1st trimester, the risk was not
statistically significant.

Use of anthrax vaccine in the United States
Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices
(ACIP), 2009

Vectorborne, and Enteric Diseases

Summary
-------
These recommendations from the Advisory Committee on Immunization
Practices (ACIP) update the previous recommendations for anthrax
vaccine adsorbed (AVA) (CDC: Use of anthrax vaccine in the United
States: Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization
Practices [ACIP]. MMWR 2000; 49: 1-20; CDC: Use of anthrax vaccine in
response to terrorism: supplemental recommendations of the Advisory
Committee on Immunization Practices [ACIP]. MMWR 2002; 51: 1024-6) and
reflect the status of anthrax vaccine supplies in the United States.
This statement
1) provides updated information on anthrax epidemiology;
2) summarizes the evidence regarding the effectiveness and efficacy,
immunogenicity, and safety of AVA;
3) provides recommendations for pre-event and preexposure use of AVA; and
4) provides recommendations for postexposure use of AVA.
In certain instances, recommendations that did not change were
clarified. No new licensed anthrax vaccines are presented.

Substantial changes to these recommendations include the following:
1. reducing the number of doses required to complete the pre-event and
preexposure primary series from 6 doses to 5 doses,
2. recommending intramuscular rather than subcutaneous AVA
administration for preexposure use,
3. recommending AVA as a component of postexposure prophylaxis in
pregnant women exposed to aerosolized _Bacillus anthracis_ spores,
4. providing guidance regarding preexposure vaccination of emergency
and other responder organizations under the direction of an
occupational health program, and
5. recommending 60 days of antimicrobial prophylaxis in conjunction
with 3 doses of AVA for optimal protection of previously unvaccinated
persons after exposure to aerosolized _B. anthracis_ spores.

[Having had the pleasure of suffering 2 attacks of _Clostridium
difficile_ infections I am not enthusiastic about extended oral
antibiotics and mine was for only 10 days and not 60. Also if the
objective is to remove the risk of an emerging latent infection with
this pathogen -- thus the long proposed protracted 60 days of
"antimicrobial prophylaxis" -- why do the authors not trust the
AVA/BioThrax to have provided adequate protection after the initial 2
injections, which the literature indicates it provides? (The 3rd shot
is just insurance.) It isn't as good a vaccine as Sterne or STI but it
is OK and has been for a number of years. - Mod.MHJ]
