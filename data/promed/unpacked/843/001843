Officers from Environment Agency Wales and Cardiff Harbour Authority
are currently investigating the cause of death of approximately 1000
fish, mainly Rudd, Roach and Chub, in the lower reaches of the river
Ely and Cardiff Bay.

Samples of fish were collected on Mon 12 May 2008 and sent to the
Environment Agency National Fisheries Laboratory. A post mortem
examination is underway. Lesions were present on almost all the fish
submitted and can be an indication of bacterial infection.

Bacterial lesions are a common feature of spawning stress in Roach.
The examined fish were in spawning condition, and the extent of the
mortality suggests that normal spawning stress may have been
compounded by other factors, such as fluctuations in dissolved oxygen.

The involvement of a fish disease cannot be ruled out at this stage.
The results of the additional tests will be forwarded as soon as they
are available.

The average pH at the site close to the mortality has also increased
over the past month. This can be a direct stressor to fish
populations. Recent increases in temperatures are also likely to have
been a contributory factor. These temperature fluctuations are
natural for this time of year [spring] and are not detrimental to the
overall water quality.

Agency Officers will continue to work closely with Cardiff Harbour
Authority and Cardiff Council's Environmental Health team to
establish the primary cause and manage clean up and disposal of the
affected fish.

John Harrison, Environment Manager for the Taff and Ely area, said:
"As soon as we know the cause, we will be better placed to decide
what measures we can take to reduce further impacts. People are urged
not to touch or take away any of the dead fish."

Anyone wishing to report dead fish can contact us in confidence on
our emergency hotline at 0800 80 70.
