The following background information on legionellosis in Italy was
extracted from the GIDEON software program:
The first case of legionellosis in Italy was reported in 1981 (from Emilia
Romagna). Passive surveillance was initiated in 1983.
819 presumptive cases and 490 confirmed cases were registered during 1983
to March
1994 - 62.6% from northern Italy. 95 cases were reported in 1994; 148 in
1994 (45.3% from Lombardia); 135 in 1995 (40.7% from Lombardia); 128 in
1996; 90 in 1997 (30.0% from Lombardia and 22.2% from Piemonte).
The male/female ratio for reported cases is 3.45/1, and 56.6% of the
patients are
above age 49.
Seropositivity rates (1996) are 2.7% in Campania and 3.8% in Calabria.
