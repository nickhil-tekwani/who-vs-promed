A disease that is killing greenfinches and chaffinches in the UK has
now spread to Europe, scientists report.

A paper in the journal Ecohealth confirms that the disease has been
found in Finland, Norway and Sweden and is at risk of moving further a
field.

The disease, called trichomonosis [a.k.a. trichomoniasis], is caused
by a parasite and was 1st seen in finches in the UK in 2005.

Since then, the country's greenfinches have declined by 35 percent,
and chaffinch populations have fallen by 7 percent.

Becki Lawson, a wildlife veterinarian at the Zoological Society for
London (ZSL) and lead author of the paper, said: "Trichomonosis has
emerged as a very serious threat to these birds, so it is very
important that vets and ornithologists collaborate to determine
whether we might see further spread and to monitor the impact of the
parasite on wild bird populations across Europe."

[_Trichomonas gallinae_ is a common protozoan parasite of pigeons
(Columbiformes) which principally infects the upper alimentary tract
where it can cause the disease, necrotic ingluvitis. Epizootic
mortality in columbiform species has been previously reported, and the
parasite infrequently infects other avian taxa such as birds of prey
and songbirds. Trichomonosis [a.k.a. trichomoniasis] has been
postulated to be a factor contributing to the extinction of the
passenger pigeon _Ectopistes migratorius_ and has been shown to be a
significant cause of nestling mortality in the island-endemic pink
pigeon _Nesoenas mayeri_ and in the Iberian Peninsula population of
the Bonelli's eagle _Hieraaetus fasciatus_. Both of these small
populations are considered to be endangered and, for both, mortality
due to trichomonosis has been highlighted as a conservation concern.

The above information, and collected data on the introduction, since
2005, of the agent into the greenfinch _Carduelis chloris_ population
in the UK, are available in Ref 1.
