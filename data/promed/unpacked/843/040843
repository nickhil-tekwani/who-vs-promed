Government and poultry industry officials intend to expand testing for bird
flu to cover most of the poultry raised in the United States, possibly
[during March 2004], an Agriculture Department official said Friday.

The $12.5 million program would focus on the most dangerous forms of the
most common variety, low pathogenic avian influenza. These forms, known as
H5 and H7, can be no worse than the chicken equivalent of the common cold.
If left to spread, however, they can mutate into highly pathogenic
varieties that can kill entire flocks in a day.

The new testing system could take effect 29 Mar 2004, assuming it gets
final Bush administration approval, said Andrew Rhorer, senior coordinator
of the Agriculture Department's Poultry Improvement Plan. The plan was
approved on 5 Mar by a committee of federal, state, and industry officials
that oversees the program, he said.

Until now, low-path bird flu had gotten a low priority from regulators.

The disease is found in nations around the world, and governments are not
required to notify international livestock health officials when an
outbreak occurs.

High-path flu, on the other hand, does require notification, which triggers
poultry export embargoes by uninfected countries.

But even the low-path form can be economically devastating. Sick chickens
do not grow as fast as healthy ones, so growers have to keep the birds
longer and spend more on feed.

States sometimes order flocks killed and have quarantined infected farms to
prevent the virus from spreading. In addition, importing nations sometimes
ban exports from low-path infected areas.

Current testing for low-path bird flu focuses on birds raised for breeding
that will be exported to nations which require certification that the
animals are free of low-path bird flu, said T.J. Meyers, co-director of the
Agriculture Department's National Center for Animal Health Programs.

State health officials test other flocks if they hear of birds that show
signs. There is no federal testing program for low-path bird flu.
