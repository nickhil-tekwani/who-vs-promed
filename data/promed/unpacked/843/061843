At a time when Assam is witnessing a major COVID-19 spike, a Japanese encephalitis outbreak has also been reported from different parts of the state raising concerns.

With about 14 per cent mortality rate, about 60 times higher than Assam's COVID-19 mortality rate, Japanese encephalitis has claimed 29 lives already this year [2020].

The vector-borne disease spread by _Culex_ mosquitos, this year [2020], has affected at least 199 people in 29 out of 33 districts in the state, a bulletin from National Health Mission (NHM), Assam, said on Sunday [2020].

In Assam now only Dina Hasao, Udalguri, and Karbi Anglong districts have not reported Japanese encephalitis cases; [the other] 29 have.

Kamrup (rural) adjoining Guwahati and Jorhat in Upper Assam are the worst-affected districts, the official sources further added.

Japanese encephalitis has been a perennial problem in the Northeast that affects the states during annual floods. In 2013, 134 people [died] of the illness, 165 died in 2014; 135 in 2015; 92 in 2016; 87 in 2017, 94 in 2018, and nearly 150 in 2019.

In Assam, every year 30% of the infected patients lose their lives, sources further added.

[Japanese encephalitis (JE) cases continue to increase this year (2020) in Assam state, from 38 cases and 5 deaths reported on 9 Jul 2020, 184 cases and 24 deaths as of 22 Jul 2020, to at least 199 cases and 29 deaths mentioned above. Interestingly, there is no mention of cases of acute encephalitis (AES) in the report above but was more frequent than JE cases in the previous reports from Assam this year (2020).

Although mosquito control is not mentioned in the report above as a JE preventive measure, it is difficult to effectively accomplish in localities where the JE virus vectors, _Culex_ spp., are abundant and widespread. Because the _Culex_ vector mosquitoes also breed in rice paddies, which may be extensive, vector control over large areas is difficult. It is curious that no mention is made of vaccination campaigns in the affected areas. Vaccination is the most effective measure to prevent JE virus infection. - Mod.TY
