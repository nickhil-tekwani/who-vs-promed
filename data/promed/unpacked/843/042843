Fresh outbreaks of bluetongue and foot and mouth disease (FMD) have forced farmers to cull infected sheep, and officials have called on traders to restrict the movement of animals.

Zliten has been badly affected, with farmers forced to kill a large number of sheep after dual outbreaks of the diseases.

Officials have started disinfecting areas where the diseases are active and have called on traders to stop the movement of livestock for 2 weeks. Infected animals need to be isolated so that farms can be properly disinfected. Precautions also need to be taken with dead animals which, officials said, must be burned and buried deep in the ground.

Livestock in Misrata are also at risk, and sheep breeders have been told to take preventative measures to stop the disease from spreading, preventing an epidemic.

An official at the Ministry of Agriculture told the Libya Herald that although rates of infection were currently very high, this was not unusual for this time of year. Both diseases are exacerbated by seasonal weather changes from warmer to cooler temperatures.

FMD is an ongoing problem in Libya, with 3 of the 7 strains of the condition identified in farms across the country. It is usually controlled by treatment with antibiotics [see comment], quarantine, and disinfection of premises.

Bluetongue is caused by a virus that mainly affects sheep and can be spread by small sand flies [see comment]. It poses no danger to humans.

[1. FMD: The 3 serotypes referred to are FMDV-O (last year of reported circulation, 2012), FMDV-SAT2 (2012), FMDV-A (2009), this, according to the information available in Libya's page of the WRLFMD (Pirbright), at http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/africa/lib.htm.

Information about the recent isolates, including in the said site, are as follows:

- FMDV SAT 2 (2012): topotype VII. Genotyping at http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/2012/WRLFMD-2012-00010%20SAT2%20Libya%202012.pdf;
- FMDV O (2012): topotype EA-3. Genotyping at http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/2012/WRLFMD-2012-00021%20O%20Libya%202012.pdf;
- FMDV A (2009): topotype ASIA, Genotype/strain Iran-05. Genotyping at http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/2009/WRLFMD-2009-00011-Libya-A.pdf.

Contrary to the statement in the newswire above, FMD, a viral disease, cannot be controlled by antibiotics, although such treatment may be helpful in the handling of secondary bacterial infections (e.g. mastitis).

2. Bluetongue: According to Libya's periodical reports to the OIE, clinical cases of bluetongue were last recorded during 2009 and 2010. No serotyping was made available.

In 2007, BTV-1 belonging to a western lineage was identified in North Africa (Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, and Morocco) and in the south of the Iberian Peninsula (Spain, Portugal, and Gibraltar). This movement into Europe may have been caused by windborne movement of adult _Culicoides_ in a similar manner to the movement of BTV-4 from Morocco to Iberia during 2003 (see 20121030.1377648).

Official confirmation or otherwise pertaining to both diseases would be appreciated. In case FMD is confirmed, its serotyping is of particular importance and interest.

Early control of the diseases, especially FMD, preferably including preventive mass vaccination, is prescribed in view of the approaching Eid-Al-Adha (Feast of the Sacrifice). This year, the feast is to be held on 14-15 Oct 2013. Eid-Al-Adha is preceded by large scale trade and transportation of animals for slaughter in Moslem countries. - Mod.AS
