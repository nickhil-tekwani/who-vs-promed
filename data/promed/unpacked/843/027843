Elk tests positive for CWD
--------------------------
Samples from big game animals taken this past hunting season turned
up something never seen in Utah before -- an elk with chronic wasting
disease. The cow elk -- along with 5 buck deer -- tested positive for
CWD. The 6 animals were taken on units in Utah where CWD has been
found in past years. CWD was not found in any new areas in Utah this
past fall.

"Chronic wasting disease is most prevalent in deer, but sometimes elk
and even moose get it," says Leslie McFarlane, wildlife disease
coordinator for the Division of Wildlife Resources (DWR).

The cow elk was taken last November [2009] on the La Sal Mountains in
southeastern Utah. Three of the 5 deer were also taken on the La Sal
Mountains. The 2 remaining deer were taken on the Central Mountains
unit in central Utah.

DWR biologists collected samples from more than 1100 deer, 37 moose
and close to 370 elk this past season.

Since the fall of 2002, the DWR has collected and tested samples from
nearly 15 000 mule deer. Of the nearly 15 000 samples, only 48 deer
have tested positive for CWD. Of those 48 deer, 39 were taken on the
La Sal Mountains.

CWD is fatal to deer, elk and moose. But there's no evidence the
disease can be transmitted to humans. More information about CWD is
