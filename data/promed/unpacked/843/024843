A rabid dog bit at least 14 people in Podmoskovye [the Moscow
Region]. A quarantine is being imposed on the inhabitants of the
village of Yadrominskoe. These people had been bitten by the dog
between 18 and 21 Jan 2010. The sick dog had been roaming in the
market area of the Kuskovo district of Istarinskoe region in Moscow
oblast. Those attacked by the rabid dog have received post-exposure
rabies vaccination in the regional hospital. The dog was euthanised
by the local veterinary service. The population in the surrounding
area is being asked for information about other victims.

There was a similar rabies case in the southeast of the Moscow region
in December 2009. At that time, 32 people were vaccinated after being
bitten by a rabid dog, and 14 were admitted to hospital for
observation [see: Rabies, canine, human - Russia: Moscow 20091230.4392).
