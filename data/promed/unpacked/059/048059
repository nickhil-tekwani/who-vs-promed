New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks:
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1 (2015/): Nystolvagen 24495, Fusa, Hordaland
Date of start of the outbreak: 29 Apr 2015
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: farm
Water type: salt water
Population type: farmed
Production system: semi-open
Total animals affected:
Species / Morbidity / Mortality / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Atlantic salmon (_Salmo salar_) / 2 (scale 0 to 5) / 2 (scale 0 to 5) / 23 000 / 1100 / 1060 / 40 / 0
Outbreak statistics (rates apparent, expressed as percentages):
Species / morbidity rate / mortality rate / case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Atlantic salmon (_Salmo salar_) / 4.78 / 4.61 / 96.36 / 4.78
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: The infectious salmon anaemia (ISA) virus at Nystolvagen - 24495 is verified as a deleted, virulent variant based on sequence analysis of ISA virus HPR (segment 6). The farm Nystolvagen is located within an ISA free compartment. From an epidemiological point of view, the Norwegian Food Safety Authority considers the ISA outbreak at Nystolvagen - 24495 to be a first occurrence within this ISA free compartment. Based on the genotyping of the complete ISA virus segment 6, it seems to be an isolated outbreak.

Control measures
Measures applied: movement control inside the country; tracing back; official destruction of clinically diseased aquatic animals; no vaccination; no treatment of affected animals.

Measures to be applied: zoning; disinfection of infected premises/establishment(s); emergency harvest; tracing forward; surveillance outside containment and/or buffer zone; official surveillance within containment and/or buffer zone.

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type:
Norwegian Veterinary Institute (regional reference laboratory)
Species / Test / Test date / Result
Atlantic salmon (_Salmo salar_) / histopathological examination / 15 May 2015 / positive
Atlantic salmon (_Salmo salar_) / immunohistochemical test / 11 May 2015 / positive
Atlantic salmon (_Salmo salar_) / real-time PCR / 29 Apr 2015 / positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[Infection with infectious salmon anaemia virus (ISAV) means infection with highly polymorphic region (HPR)-deleted ISAV or HPR0 ISAV (with a non-deleted HPR) of the genus _Isavirus_ of the family Orthomyxoviridae.

Infection with HPR-deleted ISAV may cause infectious salmon anaemia (ISA) in Atlantic salmon (_Salmo salar_), which is a generalised and lethal condition characterised by severe anaemia, and variable haemorrhages and necrosis in several organs.

For the above and additional background information including diagnostic methods and references, please refer to the OIE Aquatic Manual 2014, Chapter 2.3.5, Infection with Infectious Salmon Anaemia, at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/aahm/current/2.3.05_ISA.pdf
(NB: version adopted by the World Assembly of Delegates of the OIE in May 2014).
