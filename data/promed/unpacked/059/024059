Stanislaus County public health officials confirmed a case of St Louis encephalitis Wednesday [13 Jul 2022].

The viral disease spread by mosquitoes is less common than West Nile virus, an endemic illness that generates attention every year in the Central Valley.

According to a county news release, an adult male suffering from neurologic illness tested positive for the St Louis encephalitis virus. It's the county's 1st case of the viral disease this year [2022].

Officials did not know where the man contracted the illness. As of last week [week of 4 Jul 2022], neither St Louis nor West Nile viruses had been detected in the environment in Stanislaus County by mosquito abatement districts. The related viruses haven't been found in mosquito samples or dead birds, and no infections in horses.

"We are not aware whether the individual traveled out of county or not," a county spokesperson said by email.

A county health official reminded the public to protect themselves against mosquito bites, which can spread the 2 viruses.

"During the warmer months when mosquito activity increases and people spend more time outdoors, it is important to protect ourselves from mosquito bites to prevent mosquito-borne illnesses," Dr Thea Papasozomenos, assistant public health officer, said in the news release.

The East Side and Turlock mosquito abatement districts encouraged residents to take precautions against mosquitoes, such as insect repellent or wearing long pants and long-sleeved shirts when outdoors in the evening.

The mosquito abasement districts ask residents to report standing water where mosquitoes may breed. Also, report dead birds. Mosquito bites transmit St Louis and West Nile viruses from infected birds to people.

According to a California Department of Public Health fact sheet, most people infected with the St Louis encephalitis virus have no symptoms. In rare cases, the virus may cause swelling or inflammation of the brain. The illness may be fatal or cause long-term disability.

The milder symptoms of St Louis and West Nile infections may include fever, headache, and fatigue.

The county news release said older adults with diabetes or weakened immune systems are more vulnerable to serious illness.

Stanislaus County residents north of the Tuolumne River may report mosquito problems to Eastside Mosquito Abatement District, at 209-522-4098. Other residents may contact Turlock Mosquito Abatement District at 209-634-1234.

[St Louis encephalitis (SLE) virus is sporadically active in California. There was another SLE case in Stanislaus county last year (2021) (see St. Louis encephalitis virus - USA (04): (CA) 20211109.8699558) although it is not certain that the current case acquired SLE virus infection in this county. There were 5 human cases in 2020 in the state (see St. Louis encephalitis virus - USA: (CA) human, mosquito, 2020 20210105.8071912).

The US CDC reports that most people infected with the SLE virus have no apparent illness (https://www.cdc.gov/sle/). The 1% who become ill develop fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, and tiredness. Severe neuroinvasive disease (often involving encephalitis) occurs more commonly in older adults. Rarely, long-term disability or death can result. Unfortunately, there are no vaccines or medications available for human use. Avoidance of mosquito bites is the only preventive measure available. - Mod.TY
