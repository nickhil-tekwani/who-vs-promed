The Department of Health is today [Mon 3 Jul 2006] issuing the latest
information about the numbers of known cases of Creutzfeldt Jakob
disease. This includes cases of variant Creutzfeldt Jakob disease
[abbreviated in ProMED-mail as CJD (new var.) or vCJD], the form of
the disease thought to be linked to BSE (bovine spongiform
encephalopathy).
Definite and probable CJD cases in the UK, as of Fri 30 Jun 2006:
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Summary of vCJD Cases - Deaths
------------------------------
Deaths from definite vCJD (confirmed): 111
Deaths from probable vCJD (without neuropathological confirmation): 44
Deaths from probable vCJD (neuropathological confirmation pending): 1
Number of deaths from definite or probable vCJD (as above): 156
Summary of vCJD Cases - Alive
-----------------------------
Number of probable vCJD cases still alive: 5
Total
-----
Number of definite or probable vCJD (dead and alive): 161
(The next table will be published on Mon 7 Aug 2006).
[Since the previous monthly statistics were released on Mon 3 Jun
2006, the total number of deaths from definite or probable vCJD is
unchanged. Consequently, the overall total remains 156. The number of
vCJD cases still alive is also unchanged, therefore the overall total
number of definite or probable vCJD cases (dead and alive) remains
161.
These data are consistent with the view that the vCJD outbreak in the
UK is now in decline. The number of deaths due to definite or
probable vCJD in the UK during the 12 months of 2005 remains 5. The
peak number of deaths was 28 in the year 2000, followed by 20 in
2001, 17 in 2002, 18 in 2003, and 9 in 2004, 5 in 2005, and so far 3
in 2006. - Mod.CP]
Totals for All Types of CJD Cases in the UK during 2005 & 2006
--------------------------------------------------------------
As of 30 Jun 2006, in the UK in the year 2005, there were 122
referrals of suspected CJD, and there were 64 deaths from sporadic
CJD, 6 from familial CJD, 3 from iatrogenic CJD, 6 GSS
(Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker) syndrome cases, and 5 deaths from
vCJD.
The corresponding figures so far for the 1st 6 months of 2006 are: 44
referrals, 27 deaths from sporadic CJD, 3 from vCJD, 3 from familial
CJD, one from GSS and none from iatrogenic CJD.

[2] Papua New Guinea: Kuru reinvestigation

Study [of Kuru] Suggests More Deaths From Mad Cow Disease
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The long lives that some former cannibals enjoy before succumbing to
a brain-wasting disease suggest that many more humans will eventually
die of mad cow disease, scientists said Thursday [22 Jun 2006]. But
several experts in such illnesses, called prion diseases -- which are
blamed for killing New Guinea cannibals and British eaters of
infected beef -- disagreed with that frightening implication of the
study, which is to be published on Friday [23 Jun 2006] in The
Lancet, the British medical journal. These experts praised the
rigorous work the authors of the report did to confirm that kuru, a
disease that once decimated highland tribes in New Guinea, can
incubate for 50 years in a few genetically protected people. But the
experts said they thought that the findings did not prove that there
would be future waves of deaths among people who ate beef from
prion-infected cows in the 1980's. "That's a provocative conclusion,
but I'm not sure it's totally plausible," said Dr. David Westaway, a
prion expert at the University of Toronto.
Thus far, only about 160 people [now 161 plus another 31 outside the
UK. - Mod.CP] , mostly in Britain, have died of variant
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which humans get from cows that had bovine
spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), or mad cow disease.
The authors chronicled the deaths and genetic makeup of 11 aging
members of the
Fore tribe who died from 1996 to 2004 of kuru, which can lie dormant
for years but then start a quick, irreversible descent into dementia
and death. Kuru killed thousands of Fore people beginning in the
1920's and only began to fade after the Australian authorities in the
1950's outlawed the Fore practice of honoring their dead by
butchering them with bamboo knives at mortuary feasts, eating them
and -- by some accounts -- smearing themselves with brain tissue,
which would drive infection into cuts and scratches. Scientists
studying kuru eventually realized that it was transmitted when
misfolded prion proteins reached another brain and "taught" its
proteins to misfold and congeal into a spongy mass.
The new Lancet study relied on teams of local people who visited
mountain villages for years, interviewing and asking for blood
samples from anyone with symptoms. The 11 they found were all born
between 1933 and 1949, and cannibalism died out by 1960. The lead
author, Dr. John Collinge of University College, London concluded
that kuru could incubate as long as 56 years before killing. It has
been known for years that people with a certain genetic marker die
soonest of prion diseases. Nine of the 11 Fore did not have it. For
that reason, Dr. Collinge predicted more waves of deaths among people
who ate prion-infected beef decades ago, because most of the world
also lacks that genetic marker. "Recent estimates of the size of the
variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) epidemic based on uniform
genetic susceptibility could be substantial underestimations," he
wrote.
But several experts -- Dr. Westaway; Dr. Richard T. Johnson, a John
Hopkins University microbiologist; Dr. Robert Klitzman, a Columbia
University psychiatrist who wrote a book about kuru, and Dr. Eugene
O. Major, acting director of basic neuroscience at the National
Institutes of Health -- all said in interviews that they disagreed
that there would be huge numbers of future [vCJD] cases. Because kuru
is a human disease, it is better at infecting humans than cow disease
is, they argued, and Fore cannibals ate brain matter or got it into
skin cuts, while most people eat meat, which has low concentrations
of prions.
Guesses as to how many people will eventually die of mad cow disease
have varied wildly. In 2001, 2 groups of eminent British scientists
argued over whether it would kill 136 000 Britons or only a few
thousand. Recently, some scientists have predicted that [the disease]
will die out in a decade, while others have argued that it is still
incubating in many people and will be transmitted by blood
transfusions. No one expects no more deaths, Dr. Major said, but to
any suggestion that the 160 known now are merely the tip of an
iceberg, he said, "I think this iceberg is in a very shallow pond."
Told of their skepticism, Dr. Collinge said he was not predicting any
specific number of deaths, but did not believe that the disease was
disappearing. Britons ate a lot of brain and spinal cord in
"recovered meat" in the 1980's, he said "and there are 5 or 6 other
genes which collectively might delay the incubation period, and we
don't know which they are yet."
Dr. Johnson said he worked in New Guinea in 1964, shortly after
cannibalism had ended but while kuru -- still a scientific mystery --
was still killing 80 percent of the women in some villages while men
were being ritually executed as witches to even out the populations.
In the world of prions, he said, "every time you try to draw an
obvious conclusion, you can be sure of only one thing: be ready for
surprises."

TITLE: Kuru in the 21st century: an acquired human prion disease with
very long incubation periods

University, Perth, Australia
SUMMARY:
Background
----------
Kuru provides the principal experience of epidemic human prion
disease. Its incidence has steadily fallen after the abrupt cessation
of its route of transmission (endocannibalism) in Papua New Guinea in
the 1950s. The onset of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD), and
the unknown prevalence of infection after the extensive dietary
exposure to bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) prions in the UK,
has led to renewed interest in kuru. We investigated possible
incubation periods, pathogenesis, and genetic susceptibility factors
in kuru patients in Papua New Guinea.
Methods
-------
We strengthened active kuru surveillance in 1996 with an expanded
field team to investigate all suspected patients. Detailed histories
of residence and exposure to mortuary feasts were obtained together
with serial neurological examination, if possible.
Findings
--------
We identified 11 patients with kuru from July 1996, to June 2004, all
living in the South Fore. All patients were born before the cessation
of cannibalism in the late 1950s. The minimum estimated incubation
periods ranged from 34 to 41 years. However, likely incubation
periods in men ranged from 39 to 56 years and could have been up to 7
years longer. PRNP [the prion protein gene] analysis showed that most
patients with kuru were heterozygous at polymorphic codon 129, a
genotype associated with extended incubation periods and resistance
to prion disease.
Interpretation
--------------
Incubation periods of infection with human prions can exceed 50
years. In human infection with BSE prions, species-barrier effects,
which are characteristic of cross-species transmission, would be
expected to further increase the mean and range of incubation
periods, compared with recycling of prions within species. These data
should inform attempts to model variant CJD epidemiology.

Dissociation of pathological and molecular phenotype of variant
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in transgenic human prion protein 129
heterozygous mice.
-----------------------------------------------
By Emmanuel A. Asante and 13 others, at the Medical Research Council
Prion Unit and Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, Institute of
Neurology, University College London, National Hospital for Neurology
and Neurosurgery, Queen Square, London WC1N 3BG, United Kingdom.
Summary
-------
All neuropathologically confirmed cases of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob
disease (vCJD), characterized by abundant florid plaques and type 4
disease-related prion protein (PrPSc) in the brain, have been
homozygous for methionine at polymorphic residue 129 of PRNP.
The distinctive neuropathological and molecular phenotype of vCJD can
be faithfully recapitulated in Prnp-null transgenic mice homozygous
for human PrP M129 but not V129, where a distinct prion strain is
propagated.
Here, we model susceptibility of 129MV heterozygotes, the most common
PRNP genotype, in transgenic mice and show that, remarkably,
propagation of type 4 PrPSc was not associated with characteristic
vCJD neuropathology. Depending on the source of the inoculum, these
mice can develop 4 distinct disease phenotypes after challenge with
bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) prions or vCJD (human-passaged
BSE) prions.
vCJD-challenged mice had higher attack rates of prion infection than
BSE-challenged recipients. These data argue that human PRNP 129
heterozygotes will be more susceptible to infection with vCJD prions
than to cattle BSE prions and may present with a neuropathological
phenotype distinct from vCJD.

[This is an important paper that describes experimental results
which, although obtained from a contrived experimental situation
involving propagation of type 4 prions in genetically modified mice,
suggest that humans who are heterozygous (methionine/valine) at
residue 129 of the prion protein (PrNP) gene may not be free of risk
of developing neurological disease. Type 4 prions, which are defined
on the basis of glycosylation and fragment size pattern, are uniquely
associated with propagation in mice of material derived from vCJD
patients or BSE-affected cattle, part of the evidence linking BSE
with human vCJD. The experiments described above suggest that human
methionine/valine heterozygotes, although resistant to development of
vCJD, may be susceptible to development of as yet undefined
neurological conditions. - Mod.CP]

[5] Netherlands - 2nd suspected vCJD case

2nd probable case of vCJD in the Netherlands
-----------------------------------------------------------------
A 2nd probable case of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob (vCJD) disease in a
patient in the Netherlands was reported on 22 Jun 2006 by the
National Institute of Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) [1].
The case was detected through national surveillance of CJD, which is
coordinated at the Erasmus Medical Centre in Rotterdam. The probable
diagnosis is based on magnetic resonance imaging and clinical signs.
The patient has no mutations associated with inherited CJD and is
homozygous for methionine at codon 129 of the prion protein gene. The
diagnosis was reviewed by the United Kingdom's National
Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease Surveillance Unit, which runs the European
and Allied Countries Collaborative Study Group of CJD (EUROCJD,
<http://www.eurocjd.ed.ac.uk>).
Patient data was collected by the national public health service
together with the CJD surveillance unit and revealed no specific
exposure risks. The patient has never donated or received blood or
tissue and has not undergone surgical procedures with risk of
infection with prions. The patient has never lived in or traveled to
the United Kingdom. Contaminated meat products remain the only
plausible source of infection. Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE)
has been diagnosed in 82 cows in the Netherlands since 1997,
according to data from the Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food
Quality. [2]
This report brings the total number of vCJD cases reported to EUROCJD
from outside the UK by June 2006 to 31: 17 in France, 4 in the
republic of Ireland, 2 each in the United States and the Netherlands,
and 1 in each in Italy, Canada, Saudi Arabia, Japan, Portugal and
Spain. Six of these 31 cases were in people who lived in the UK for
more than 6 months between 1980 and 1996 [3].
