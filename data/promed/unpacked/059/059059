[Sheep and goat pox (S&GP) are contagious viral skin diseases. They
may be mild in indigenous breeds from endemic areas but are often
fatal in newly introduced animals. Infections can limit trade,
export, and the development of intensive livestock production. It is
included in OIE's list of notifiable diseases, and used to be a List
A disease.

The causative agents are members of the _Capripox_ genus in the
family _Poxviridae_. Most isolates cause disease mainly in sheep or
mainly in goats; some isolates can cause serious disease in both
species. Notably, the previous outbreak of S&GP in Mongolia (January
2007) affected sheep, while the current one has, reportedly, affected
goats. The causative viruses cannot be distinguished from each other
with current techniques. Only one serotype exists.

Sheep and goat pox viruses cause disease only in these 2 species.
Infections have not been seen in wild ungulates. The disease does not
affect humans.

The disease's geographic distribution includes central and north
Africa, central Asia, the Middle East, and parts of the Indian
subcontinent. Previous to 2007, S&GP was recorded in Mongolia in
1976; according to OIE's Handistatus information, vaccinations have
been carried out in Mongolia until 2000. - Mod.AS]
