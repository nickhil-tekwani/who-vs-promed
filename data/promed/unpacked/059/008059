A herpesvirus has devastated North Island oyster farms, and so far
cost about [NZD] 12 million [approx. USD 9 million] in potential
sales, and has shut the pioneering Nelson hatchery that supplies 20
per cent of New Zealand's stock.

No explanation has yet been found for how the virus, which has killed
about half of Northland's farmed Pacific oysters due for harvest next
year [2012], got into the Cawthron Institute's hatchery at The Glen.

But there was nothing to suggest that the hatchery itself, opened
with great fanfare in mid-2009, was the source of the outbreak,
Cawthron business development manager Mike Mandeno said yesterday [20
Feb 2011].

"It's a temporary setback for us in terms of producing more stock.
We'll be trying again at the end of the month."

Juvenile-farmed Northland oysters began dying towards the end of last
year [2010] and the cause was identified by MAF [Ministry of
Agriculture and Forestry] scientists as a form of herpes which poses
no risk to humans but which has been blamed for killing large numbers
of oysters in France over the past 3 years. It is also found in many
other countries, including Australia.

Mr Mandeno said Cawthron had hatchery samples tested when the problem
was found in the North Island. The virus wasn't detected in the spat,
but was found in larvae that had died at the hatchery, and production
was stopped.

The larvae were produced following the spawning of male and female
oysters at the hatchery, and one of the problems Cawthron faced was in
getting brood stock, partly because of movement controls imposed by
the industry to try to stop the virus spreading further, Mr Mandeno
said.

He said the hatchery could produce 25 million to 50 million Pacific
oyster spat a year, enough for a fifth of the industry's requirements.
The rest is gathered from the wild.

"All spat has been affected by the virus. That has included our spat
that we've supplied to customers, but also wild spat in areas that
we've never supplied hatchery-bred spat to."

Two staff are employed at the hatchery, and the closure had not
affected their employment, he said.

"It's a challenge, but it's one we're very well placed to resolve,
and we believe we will resolve it. This is exactly why you need
selectively bred oysters, because that's how you develop resistance to
these sorts of viruses."

Cawthron did not know how the virus arrived at the hatchery, he said,
but neither the evidence nor the pattern of mortality supported the
idea that it might have been spread around Northland by hatchery spat.
"The virus has popped up in places that are nowhere near harbours
we've sent spat to."

MAF response manager Richard Norman was on leave this week. He said
last month [January 2011] that unusually hot weather might have
triggered the virus's onslaught. Because it had probably been present
in the wild oyster population for many years, it was unlikely it could
ever be eradicated.

Aquaculture New Zealand chief executive Mike Burrell said the virus
was specific to Pacific oysters throughout the world and posed no
threat to the mussel industry.

He said the oyster industry was united and had been working closely
with the Government and Biosecurity New Zealand on a recovery plan.
While the virus caused no food safety issues, "there are far fewer
oysters". [Perhaps not food safety issues, but it will likely cause
the price of oysters to increase. - Mod.TG]

"Economically, it's going to be a hard 2 years ahead. The good news
is that we've got the industry working together."

Oyster Industry Association executive officer Tom Hollings said he
thought it would have a heavy impact for some time to come. There were
about 3 dozen farming entities with several hundred workers, he said,
covering 1100 hectares [approx. 2700 acres] , and with the losses
concentrated on juvenile stock, "the real crunch will come this year".
"We're looking at having lost about half the crop. We will be
assessing their situation as we come into harvest this calendar year
[2011].

"An important thing that we'll look closely at is how we can breed a
better oyster," Mr Hollings said. This was where the Nelson hatchery
could be instrumental in securing the industry's future.

Pacific oyster farming is the smallest sector of the New Zealand
marine farming industry, accounting for 6 per cent of aquaculture
exports, worth [NZD] 16.2 million [approx. USD 12 million] in 2009.
Domestic Pacific oyster sales were estimated at [NZD] 9 million
[approx. USD 6.7 million]. In contrast, mussel exports were [NZD]
202.5 million [approx. USD 151 million] and salmon [NZD] 61 million
[approx USD 46 million].

But oysters are seen as one of the keys to growing aquaculture into a
billion-dollar sector by 2025.

Cawthron has been breeding oysters for more than a decade and spent
[NZD] 750 000 [approx. USD 560 000] developing the hatchery.

[Although all herpes strains are DNA-based viruses, herpes, which
infects everything from cows to clams to monkeys, comes in a wide
variety of species, each with their own unique set of symptoms. Among
humans, perhaps the best known forms are the _Herpes simplex_ viruses,
which are spread through close contact and can manifest themselves as
oral and genital blisters.

A new strain named _Ostreid herpesvirus- 1 (OsHV-1) mew-var_, remains
dormant until water temperatures exceed 16 deg C (61 deg F), which UK
waters reach in the height of summer, according to Kevin Denham of the
British government's Fish Health Inspectorate. [And likely New Zealand
waters reach these temperatures as well. - Mod.TG]

_Ostreid_ herpes viruses are known to affect not only oysters but
also clams, scallops, and other mollusks, according to Tristan
Renault, director of Ifremer's genetic and pathology lab. Like the
other strains of herpes that affect mollusks, _OsHV-1 mew-var_ attacks
young oysters during breeding season, when the mollusks' bodies are so
focused on producing sperm and eggs that the oysters have no energy to
maintain an immune system, Renault said. But _OsHV-1 mew-var_ is "more
virulent than strains we identified before," Renault said, adding that
the virus is so efficient at killing its hosts that it can wipe out 80
per cent of the oysters in a bed within a week.

Clinical signs of the disease may include high levels of mortality
particularly affecting juvenile stages of Pacific oysters. These signs
usually appear when water temperatures exceed 16 deg C (61 deg F).

Currently there is no cure once this disease has infected an area.
However, there is a PCR test for early detection and potentially for
confirmation.
