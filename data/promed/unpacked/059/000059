KAMPALA 15 Dec 1998 (AFP) Uganda on Tuesday [sic] warned its citizens
living along the border with the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) about a
meningitis outbreak that has killed 157 people in Burundi and the DRC.
The epidemic poses a serious threat to Ugandans living in areas bordering
on the DRC and on Rwanda, according to a statement released by health
ministry official Kihumuro Apuuli. "There exists treatment and cure for the
disease by use of some commonly available drugs in health units," the
statement said, adding that the health ministry was ready to take up the
challenge if the disease breaks out in the border districts.
[As a comment I would add that because of the present conflict in the DRC
there is at the moment a heightened level of traffic between Uganda and the
DRC, both in terms of troop movements and commercial trucking operations.
This could make for rapid spread of the disease both in Uganda and the DRC.
