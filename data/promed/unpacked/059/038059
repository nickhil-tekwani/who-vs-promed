A method involving the release of mosquitoes inoculated with bacteria [_Wolbachia_] that block development of the dengue virus is already being used in Viet Nam, Indonesia, and Australia, and recently in Brazil, it was reported.

Malaysia, which has seen an increase in dengue cases by more than 200 percent in since last year [2013], has reportedly expressed interest in the new research but not offered any firm commitment.

A trial of 10 000 "good mosquitoes" inoculated with _Wolbachia_ that block the dengue virus began in Brazil, AFP reported. These "good" _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes are to reproduce with wild mosquitoes and create offspring that will no longer transmit the dengue virus.

Harmless to humans, the goal is for them to breed out the "bad" _Aedes_ mosquitoes. They were released in the northern Rio neighbourhood of Tubiacanga recently as part of an innovative programme to curb the spread of the tropical disease.

This approach has already been tested and in use in Viet Nam, Indonesia, and Australia, according to the report.

If it works in Brazil, the country said to be the most affected by dengue since 2000, could finally have an answer to a disease that has infected 7 million and killed 800 people.

Professor Scott O'Neill, who heads the international Eliminate Dengue Research Programme, last week [week of 1 Oct 2014] said the Malaysian government had shown interest in the _Wolbachia_-inoculated mosquitoes. But there were no concrete plans to adopt the approach here [in Malaysia], The Sun newspaper reported him as saying. "We have talked to the Malaysian government about our work, and they have shown some interest and even requested for extra information. "So hopefully in the future we will be able to start our programme here," the Australian scientist told The Sun.

Colombia, he said, was the next country where the _Wolbachia_ method would be tested. Within the next 3 years, he said, scientists should know how effective the approach was in controlling dengue.

_Wolbachia_ are parasitical bacteria living inside insect cells and are present in up to 60 percent of all different insect species, including mosquitoes, but not those that transmit diseases like dengue and malaria.

Research over the years has demonstrated that the _Wolbachia_ bacteria had the potential to be used in controlling mosquitoes that spread human diseases. When present in _Aedes_ mosquitoes, the bacteria could reduce their ability to transmit the dengue virus.

Dengue cases have increased in Malaysia by more than 250 percent from 52 096 cases in 2013 to 72 603 this year between [1 Jan and 13 Sep 2014].

The number of deaths also climbed from 43 last year [2013] to 136 this year [2014] over the same period.

The latest figures on the iDengue website (<idengue.remotesensing.gov.my>) show that cases have increased to 76 700 as of [3 Oct 2014]. In just 2 days from [1 Oct 2014] the number of cases rose by 621.

The 5 states with the highest number of cases are Selangor (37 350), followed by Kelantan (13 050), Kuala Lumpur (5260), Johor (4316), and Perak (4136).

It was reported in 2010 that Putrajaya considered the release of GM [genetically modified] mosquitoes to curb dengue but the idea was resisted by environmentalists, who doubted the effectiveness of the approach and feared other unintended consequences.

The field trial for the GM anti-dengue mosquitoes -- developed by a British-based insect biotech company, Oxitec -- was undertaken by the Institute for Medical Research, an agency under the Health Ministry. When the trial was carried out in December 2010 with some 6000 transgenic mosquitoes released in Bentong, Pahang, scientists and opponents of the move were reportedly surprised, thinking that the study had been postponed due to protests.

In July [2014?], deputy health minister Datuk Seri Dr Hilmi Yahya was quoted by Bernama [Malaysian National News Agency] as saying that the government had yet to decide on whether to use GM mosquitoes to fight dengue.

He cited high cost and doubts over its efficacy as the reason, and said the trial conducted in December 2010 was on mosquito resistance and to see how far the GM insects could fly.

Earlier this year [2014], following the rising number of dengue cases, the Malaysian Medical Association (MMA) also suggested that abate, a potent larvicide, be made available free at all health clinics, including private ones, to combat the spread of the virus.

Last month [September 2014], the Wall Street Journal reported that the current dengue outbreak has been attributed in part to a more virulent strain which researchers called DEN-2, which was said to be more dangerous than the 3 other strains. The lack of immunity to the DEN-2 strain is also the reason for the higher number of deaths this year [2014].

However, there may also be hope in fighting the disease with French pharmaceutical company Sanofi now testing a dengue vaccine in Latin American countries.

Tests have shown dengue cases reduced by about 60 percent in children and hospitalization risks were cut by 80 percent, Sanofi reported in early September [2014].

[Innovative ways to control dengue including the use of _Wolbachia_ bacteria and guppy fish were applied in different countries and can be replicated elsewhere, if appropriate, even though abate and vaccination are the most prevalent approaches.

_Wolbachia_
-----------
_Wolbachia_ are bacteria that live within insect cells and are passed from one generation to the next through the insect's eggs. _Wolbachia_ is present in up to 60 percent of all the different species of insects around us including some mosquitoes that bite people but not the major mosquito species involved in the transmission of diseases such as dengue and malaria. For many years now scientists have been studying _Wolbachia_ looking for ways to utilise the bacteria to potentially control the mosquitoes that spread human diseases.

_Wolbachia pipientis_ was first observed in the ovaries and testes of the mosquito, _Culex pipiens_ in the 1920s. Early studies showed that it was not a pathogen of mammals but instead a naturally occurring and harmless symbiotic bacterium of insects. Since those early studies it has since been determined that it is extremely common in insects, with estimates suggesting that up to 60 percent of all insect species naturally carry different strains of _Wolbachia_. Considering that there may be 2-5 million different insect species on the planet _Wolbachia_ is a very successful and pervasive insect bacterium."

Guppy fish
----------
Larvae-eating guppy fish can help combat the spread of dengue, a mosquito-borne illness giving rise to hundreds of thousands of severe cases including 20 000 deaths worldwide every year, according to a trial study by the Governments of Cambodia and the Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), with the support of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the World Health Organization (WHO).

"This is a low-cost, year-round, safe way of reducing the spread of dengue in which the whole community can participate," said ADB health specialist Gerard Servais. "It offers a viable alternative to using chemicals and can reduce the scale of costly emergency response activities to contain epidemics."

The community-based project, conducted in 2 districts in Cambodia and the Lao PDR from 2009 to 2011, resulted in a sharp decline in mosquito larvae in water storage tanks after the tiny fish were introduced. Guppies eat larvae that grow into mosquitoes, which in turn bite humans and transmit dengue."

Abate
-----
When applied to standing water where mosquitoes and other insects breed, Abate kills the larvae before they develop into mature insects. In effect, it short-circuits the cycle that disseminates the pathogen to humans. Several vector-borne diseases, such as malaria and dengue fever, may be strongly associated with the domestic storage of drinking water. One option, where there is a significant risk of disease, is to prevent disease vectors from breeding in stored, domestic drinking water. Temephos, the active ingredient in Abate is recommended by the World Health Organization for addition to drinking water.

Vaccine development
-------------------
French drug maker Sanofi, developing the 1st vaccine against dengue fever, said its product reduced disease cases by 60.8 percent in a large final clinical trial.

Sanofi has invested more than 1.3 billion euros (USD 1.7 billion) in the project, undertaking 2 decades of research on the world's fastest-growing tropical disease.

The final study -- conducted on 20 875 children aged 9-16 across 5 countries in Latin America -- confirmed that the vaccine was safe, provided high protection against dengue hemorrhagic fever and cut by 80 percent the risk of hospitalization, the Paris-based company said on [Wed 3 Sep 2014].

- Shizuoka prefecture. 29 Sep 2014. Dengue. The Japanese government said [Mon 29 Sep 2014] that a man in Shizuoka Prefecture was infected with a new-type dengue fever virus as it has a different genetic sequence from that of the virus detected in other people in Japan since August [2014]. The man developed dengue symptoms on 10 Sep [2014] and was identified on 18 Sep [2014]. The site of his infection has not been fixed as he said he visited Tokyo in early September and was bitten by a mosquito 9 or 10 Sep [2014] in the eastern part of Shizuoka.
