BURKHOLDERIA CEPACIA, URINE - USA: (NEW YORK), REQUEST FOR INFORMATION

A patient was admitted without fever but pyuria [pus in the urine]
present. There were no previous hospitalizations, no cystic fibrosis
patient exposures,
no previous antibiotics, and no use of catheters at home. No fevers
were noted in the 1st 6 hours after admission.

4 hours after admission a Foley catheter was placed, apparently
traumatically, with development of gross hematuria. The Foley
catheter was left in place. 2 hours after [the catheter] was placed
[the patient] developed shaking chills and then fever to 103 deg F
(39.4 deg C). Four sets of blood cultures were positive for
_Burkholderia cepacia_ and the urine culture obtained on the next
day, positive also, grew the same organism. No urine culture was
obtained on admission, before, or at the time of catheter placement.
Cystoscopy showed false lumen created by the catheter insertion.

Given the rarity of this organism for a primary urine source, the
possibility of contamination at the time of catheter placement is
being considered. The catheter and kit in question are not available.
2 other kits of the same size on same unit were opened and poviodine,
lubricants, and water were cultured.

Has anyone seen other similar cases?

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Clynes for this communication.

_B. cepacia_ is a nonfermentative, aerobic, Gram-negative bacillus,
formerly classified as _Pseudomonas_. _B. cepacia_ is an organism of
low virulence with limited ability to cause infection in humans. _B.
cepacia_ survives and multiplies in aqueous hospital environments,
where it may persist for long periods even in distilled water and in
certain antiseptic solutions such as quaternary ammonium salts. The
results of the cultures obtained from the other 2 kits are not stated.
