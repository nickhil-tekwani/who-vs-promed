Malaria in Israeli tourists visiting Thailand
---------------------------------------------
GeoSentinel, the global surveillance program of the International Society
of Travel Medicine, wishes to report 2 additional travel-related cases of
_Plasmodium falciparum_ malaria acquired in areas of Thailand generally
considered to be malaria-free and for which chemoprophylaxis is not
recommended by organizations such as WHO and the US CDC.
These cases were entered into our database 6 months ago, so Dr Weitzel's
new case reinforces the potential for risk to travelers to Koh Phangan. The
cases were reported by Eli Schwartz at the GeoSentinel ISR site at Tel
Hashomer Hospital in Jerusalem. Both patients were 25 year old males who
travelled on the same itinerary in Thailand and were hospitalized on 2 and
4 Nov 2005. Both had returned 20 Oct 2005 after a 19 day stay in Thailand
and presented with high-grade fever. One patient had been only to Thailand,
and only to Koh Phangan (except for a few hours in the Bangkok airport
during daytime hours). The other case had the same itinerary within
Thailand but had spent a few weeks beforehand trekking in high-altitude
areas of Nepal with no visits to malarious areas. In both cases, diagnosis
was confirmed by microscopy with a _P. falciparum_ parasitemia above 1 per
cent. One patient received Malarone, the other oral quinine and doxycycline
and both recovered uneventfully.
We note with interest that Dr Weitzel's patient had visited Koh Phangan. At
our ISR site, cases of malaria from Koh Phangan have not been seen in at
least 15 years experience with travelers to this destination which is
highly visited by Israeli tourists, and whom have never taken prophylaxis
for this destination.

[Thailand is not malaria-free and 2 studies have found an monthly incidence
of _P. falciparum_ malaria of about 1 per 35 000 travelers and 1 per 15 000
travelers of all species of malaria (Hill, et al. Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg
1996; 90: 681-1; Kofoed & Petersen J Trav Med 2003; 10: 150-4). This risk
is considered so low that the risk of serious side effects from malaria
chemoprophylaxis far outweigh the risk of malaria infection. The 2 new
cases reported here and the case reported by ProMED on 11 May, may indicate
an increasing risk in southern Thailand, and a comment from the Thai
authorities would be welcome.
Thailand reported 37 335 malaria cases in 2004 with 325 fatalities and a
_P. falciparum_ rate of 51 per cent
(<http://eng.moph.go.th/SpecificHealth/malaria/malaria.htm>). The report
also state "In southern peninsula, there has been re-emergence of malaria
transmission in many districts where it has been eradicated. Phuket
province reported indigenous cases where it has been eradicated earlier.
One of the main reasons for this problem is illegal migrant labour force
from Myanmar." A recent update on malaria in the Thai population of
southern Thailand is needed, but at present it would probably be premature
to introduce a recommendation of chemoprophylaxis to all travellers to
southern Thailand. - Mod.EP]
