Dr. Edgar Rante, municipal health officer of Burgos, Ilocos Sur, confirmed that the residents were experiencing symptoms of chikungunya fever.

He said that the local government unit has already sought assistance from the Department of Health (DoH) to help sustain the medication of the patients and contain the spread of the mosquito-borne disease.
