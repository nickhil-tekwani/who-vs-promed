On [5 Nov 2020], oral and nasal swabs were collected from a 1.5-year-old female poodle living in a COVID-19 positive household in Bitonto (Bari), Apulia, Southern Italy. A pool of the swabs diluted in viral transport medium was tested for SARS-CoV-2 by a real-time RT-PCR assay developed at Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut, Germany and targeting the N gene (Ref 1). The pool tested positive, with a cycle threshold (CT) value of 35.7. Nasal, oral, and/or rectal swabs collected on the following 4 days also tested positive to SARS-CoV-2 with very high CT values (ranging from 35.61 to 40.71), indicating very low virus amounts in the dog samples.

The poodle was living with a family of 4 members; all showed mild symptoms of COVID-19. One member of the family had tested positive with an antigenic test carried out on 3 Nov 2020. The dog, currently under observation, has not shown clinical signs thus far. There were no other pets in the same household.

[We are grateful to Prof Decaro and his colleagues in Bari for this 1st-hand report, notifying the 1st COVID-19 infection in a dog in Italy.

The sub-clinical picture is in tandem with most SARS-CoV-2 dog infections observed elsewhere. Dogs have not been found, so far, to transmit the virus.

SARS-CoV-2 infections in dogs have already been observed in numerous countries, of which the following 4 have submitted reports to the OIE: Hong Kong SAR, USA, Japan, and Canada. Infections in cats, a species presenting mostly mild clinical signs or remaining subclinical following infection, are regarded potentially able to transmit the virus to other cats. Cat infections have been reported to the OIE from 10 countries.

Subscribers are encouraged to visit OIE's updated and upgraded COVID-19 portal, which now includes a global map presenting the reported COVID-19 events in animals, as well as a table with links to all reports (https://www.oie.int/scientific-expertise/specific-information-and-recommendations/questions-and-answers-on-2019novel-coronavirus/events-in-animals/).

In the table, Italy presents a single, non-clinical infection in a mink which was observed on 10 Aug 2020 in Lombardy. The linked official report notes that the total number of mink farms in Italy is 9, distributed in Lombardy, Veneto, Emilia-Romagna, and Abruzzo. - Mod.AS
