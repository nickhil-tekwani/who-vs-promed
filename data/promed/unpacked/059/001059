The discussion on ProMED-mail concerning the recent BSE cases in Belgium
and France made me feel it might be useful to post the results of a
journalistic investigation I published in the British science weekly New
Scientist last year (Secrets and Lies in Europe, New Scientist, 3 May 1997,
p14-15). Nothing has happened since to change the conclusion I reached
then. (The article may be accessed at
<http://www.newscientist.com/nsplus/insight/bse/bse.html>.)
The conclusion was that there must be many cases of unreported BSE on the
Continent, and that they are being fed to other cattle, spreading the
infection. This was based on three lines of evidence: the non-reporting of
probable cases in live cattle imported from Britain; inadequate veterinary
surveillance; and poor controls on meat and bone meal (MBM).
Research by the Dutch Institute for Animal Science in Lelystad shows that,
given the known incidences of BSE in British cattle between 1985 and 1990,
at least 1688 of the 57,900 cattle exported for breeding to Europe during
those years, which then lived for another two years, should have got BSE.
The degree to which overall rates of BSE in British cattle can be applied
to select breeding stock has since been questioned, but there must
nonetheless have been a substantial number of sick beasts among them. They
were not reported to veterinary authorities, so they entered the food
chain. This is moreover a conservative estimate, of breeding animals only,
not total live cattle exports. This tells us both that the infection must
be present on the Continent, and that veterinary surveillance systems have
not detected it.
Has surveillance improved? Not much. Emmanuel Vanopdenbosch, head of
Belgium's National Institute for Veterinary Research and of the scientific
committee that advises the European Commission on BSE, says that even in
the absence of BSE, the incidence of diseases with BSE-like neurological
symptoms is about 100 a year per million head of cattle. If farmers are
reporting fewer than that to authorities, then cattle with such symptoms
are not being reported, hence they are entering the food chain. And if
there is BSE present, some of those cattle might have had it. The reporting
rates (concentrated in regions with rabies) in 1996 were 48 per million in
Belgium; 70 in Germany; nine in France; eight in Holland. That such low
reporting rates can miss BSE was demonstrated when the Dutch trebled theirs
in 1997, and immediately started finding cases.
The European Commission keeps these surveillance rates secret. They are
unobtainable for some countries. Limited or non-existent compensation for
farmers who report sick animals, even threats against those who do, work
against effective surveillance in many places.
Besides live cattle, MBM from Britain is likely to have introduced
infection to the Continent. Exports to the EU did not end until 1994.
France banned it in 1989. The case recently found in France was born in
1993. But a French parliamentary enquiry last year found that large amounts
of cheap British MBM were smuggled into France until 1994 mainly through
Belgium.
But Continental MBM must also now also be considered at risk from
undetected, infected animals. A confidential European Commission report on
European rendering plants in 1997 found hygiene practices broadly incapable
of preventing BSE transmission. Feeding mammalian MBM to ruminants has been
illegal in the EU since 1994, but is still legal for pigs and chickens. BSE
cases in France born after 1994 are thought to have arisen either because
pig feed was given to cattle, or because cattle feed was contaminated by
pig feed left over in the milling machinery, which can amount to ten per
cent of a batch.
Infected MBM puts the whole European herd at risk, as MBM is traded freely
in the EU. Germany puts its faith in high-temperature pressure cooking of
MBM, even though this does not destroy all infectivity; five of the
(imported) BSE cows found in Germany were rendered for feed. France says it
catches all cases through surveillance, and refuses to cook MBM even though
the EU requires it. The first Belgian BSE case was added to MBM
subsequently sent to Belgium, Holland and Poland. It is said to have been
taken back.
Of the British MBM imported into Belgium before 1994, one bag in ten
remained in Belgium. The rest caused French cases. The two Belgian cases
were born before 1994. Hence their dismissal as "spontaneous" must be open
to question, scientifically interesting though such sporadic cases may be.
It will be interesting now to see if such admissions that infection is
present on the Continent continue. It bodes ill that Germany has balked at
removing nervous tissue from slaughtered cattle, although this has been
agreed by the EU, as it claims to be BSE free.
