Novosibirsk is one of the 3 regions with the highest morbidity from
opisthorchiasis, after Tyumen and Tomsk regions, reported Larissa
Vovney, deputy of the main physician of Municipal Infectious Clinical
Hospital 1 [in Novosibirsk].
The organism responsible for the disease is found in the rivers Ob,
Irtysh, Dnepr, Donets, Volga, Kama, and Neman.
The highest incidence of the disease is found along the middle and
lower parts of the rivers Irtysh and Ob, where up to 80 percent of
the population.are carriers. People acquire opisthorchiasis by
eating raw and under-cooked fish from the rivers. Especially
dangerous are Idus melanotus, Cyprinus carpio, Carassius, and Cyprinus barbus.
According to Larissa Vovney, morbidity in the population is stable,
and in 2005, 121 cases of opisthorchiasis were found per 100 000
inhabitants, and in 2006, 125 per 100 000 inhabitants.

[For background data, please refer to the ProMED posting on
opisthorchiasis in Russia, 22 Feb 2007 (archive 20070222.0659). The
data on prevalence and morbidity do not fit, and if up to 80% percent
of the population are infected, the given rate of clinical disease of
121-125 cases per 100 000 seems small. - Mod.EP] [One explanation for
the discrepancy might be a very high prevalence in a localized small
population -Mod.DK]
