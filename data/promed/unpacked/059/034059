Situation summary in the Americas
---------------------------------
Since epidemiological week (EW) 1 [Sun 1 to Sat 7 Jan 2017] to EW 19 [Sun 7 to Sat 13 May 2017] of 2017, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, the Plurinational State of Bolivia, and Suriname have reported suspected and confirmed yellow fever cases.

The following is an update on the situation in Brazil. The situation in the other countries was reported in the epidemiological update of [25 Apr 2017] and in previous updates, and no significant changes have been reported since then.

In Brazil, since the beginning of the outbreak in December 2016 up to [18 May 2017], there have been 3192 suspected cases of yellow fever reported (758 confirmed, 1812 discarded, and 622 remain under investigation), including 426 deaths (264 confirmed, 120 discarded, and 42 under investigation). The case fatality rate (CFR) among confirmed cases is 34 per cent.

According to the probable site of infection, the cases were reported in 398 municipalities, while the confirmed cases were distributed among 131 municipalities in 7 states (Espírito Santo, Goiás, Minas Gerais, Pará, Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, and Tocantins).

With regard to the confirmed fatal cases and their probable site of infection, 80 were in Espírito Santo, 1 in Goiás, 164 in Minas Gerais, 4 in Pará, 5 in Rio de Janeiro, and 10 in São Paulo. In the states with more than 5 confirmed deaths, the CFR among confirmed cases is 50 per cent in São Paulo, 35 per cent in Rio de Janeiro, 34 per cent in Minas Gerais and Espírito Santo.

No cases or epizootics have been confirmed in new municipalities in Espírito Santo (ES), Minas Gerais (MG), and São Paulo (SP) in the last 2 weeks. The dates of symptom onset of the most recently confirmed cases are [14 Mar 2017] (MG), [19 Apr 2017] (SP), and [24 Apr 2017] (ES). The state of Pará reported 4 confirmed cases in EW 13 [week 26 Mar to 1 Apr 2017], and the state of Tocantins reported a confirmed case in EW 16 [16 to 22 Apr 2017]. In addition, a case was confirmed in the state of Goiás in an area known to be at risk for yellow fever.

Although no confirmed cases have been reported to date in the state of Bahia, since the beginning of the year up to [8 May 2017], a total of 255 epizootics [cases in monkeys] were reported in 78 municipalities; 54 of these epizootics were positive for yellow fever by RT-PCR in 28 municipalities, and 4 were in neighborhoods of Salvador.

To date, the _Aedes aegypti_ vector has not been reported to have a role in transmission. However, confirmed epizootics in large cities, such as Vitoria in Espírito Santo4 and Salvador in Bahia, represent a high risk for a change in the transmission cycle.

Figure 1 shows the trend in the number of reported cases, according to their actual classification (confirmed, discarded, under investigation), in the 4 states that account for 99 per cent of all the confirmed cases.

Figure 2 illustrates the municipalities with confirmed cases and cases under investigation, as well as confirmed epizootics, and epizootics under investigation that correspond to the cumulative total in 3 different dates. Figure 2 [map]. Geographic distribution of human cases (confirmed/suspected) and confirmed epizootics of yellow fever, [31 Jan 2017], [2 Mar 2017], and [18 May 2017].

Since the beginning of the outbreak up to [18 May 2017], a total of 3660 deaths in nonhuman primates (NHP) were reported, of which 565 were confirmed for yellow fever, 96 were discarded, and 1467 remain under investigation. Between the release of yellow fever bulletins numbers 39 and 41 by the Brazil Ministry of Health, the number of reported deaths in NHP did not change.

Epizootics in NHP were reported in the Federal District and in the states of Alagoas, Amazonas, Bahia, Goiás, Espírito Santo, Mato Grosso, Mato Grosso do Sul, Minas Gerais, Pará, Paraíba, Paraná, Pernambuco, Rio Grande do Norte, Rio Grande do Sul, Rio de Janeiro, Rondônia, Roraima, Santa Catarina, São Paulo, Sergipe, and Tocantins.

Reports of epizootics currently under investigation in states bordering Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Guyana, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname, Uruguay, and Venezuela represent a risk of spread of the virus to the bordering countries, especially in areas with similar ecosystems.

With regard to the outbreak response implemented by the Brazil Ministry of Health, between January and May 2017, 24.5 million doses of yellow fever vaccine were distributed to intensify the selective vaccination strategy in 1028 municipalities of the states of Bahia, Espírito Santo, Minas Gerais, Rio de Janeiro, and São Paulo. As of [18 May 2017], administrative coverage equal to or greater than 95 per cent was reached in 285 municipalities; coverage between 75 and 94.9 per cent was reached in 375 municipalities; and coverage of less than 75 per cent was reached in 368 municipalities (92 of these municipalities have coverage lower than 50 per cent).

Recommendations
---------------
Given the current yellow fever situation in Brazil and the emergence of cases in areas where cases have not been detected in several years, the Pan American Health Organization, Regional Office of the World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) urges member states to continue efforts to detect, confirm, and adequately and timely treat cases of yellow fever. To this end, health care workers should be kept up-to-date and trained to detect and treat cases especially in areas of known virus circulation.

PAHO/WHO encourages member states to take the necessary actions to keep travelers informed and vaccinated, when heading to areas where yellow fever vaccination is recommended.

Vaccination
-----------
The yellow fever vaccine is safe and affordable and provides effective immunity against the disease in the range of 80-100 per cent of those vaccinated after 10 days and 99 per cent immunity after 30 days. A single dose provides life-long protection against yellow fever disease. A booster dose of yellow fever vaccine is not needed.

Given the limitations on the availability of vaccines and with the aim of promoting the rational use, PAHO / WHO reiterates its recommendations to national authorities:
1) conduct an assessment of vaccination coverage against yellow fever in areas at risk at the municipal level to guarantee at least 95 per cent coverage among the resident population of these areas;
2) member states that are not currently experiencing outbreaks should not conduct an immunization campaign. Priority should be given to the use of vaccines in susceptible populations and to avoid revaccination;
3) ensure vaccination of all travelers to endemic areas at least 10 days before traveling;
4) depending on vaccine availabilities, member states should have a small stock that allows them to respond to outbreaks;
5) postpone routine vaccination in children in non-endemic areas until sufficient vaccines are available. Once there is availability, catch-up campaigns should be conducted to complete vaccination schedules.

Precautions
-----------
It is recommended to individually assess the epidemiological risk of contracting disease when faced with the risk of an adverse event occurring in persons over 60 years who have not been previously vaccinated.
- The vaccine can be offered to individuals with asymptomatic HIV infection with CD4+ counts ≥ 200 cells / mm3 requiring vaccination.
- Pregnant women should be vaccinated in an emergency situation and following recommendations of health authorities.
- Vaccination is recommended in lactating women who live in endemic areas, since the risk of transmitting the vaccine virus to the child is lower than the benefits of the vaccination of breastfeeding women.
- For pregnant or lactating women traveling to areas with yellow fever transmission, vaccination is recommended when travel cannot be postponed or avoided. They should receive advice on the potential benefits and risks of vaccination to make an informed decision. The benefits of breastfeeding are superior to those of other nutritional alternatives.

The following people are usually excluded from yellow fever vaccination:
- immunocompromised individuals (Including those with thymus disorders, symptomatic HIV, malignant neoplasms under treatment, and those that are receiving or have received immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory treatments, recent transplants, and current or recent radiation therapy);
- people with severe allergies to eggs and their derivatives.

[Fortunately, the outbreak appears to be declining and still no instances have been documented of _Aedes aegypti_ urban transmission, although that risk will continue as long as the sylvan (forest) transmission cycle is occurring. Persistence of yellow fever virus in endemic sylvan (forest) cycles of transmission in Brazil and neighboring countries is reason enough to maintain a high proportion of the population -- at least 80 per cent -- vaccinated in areas of risk. The above report indicates that the availability of the vaccine is limited at this time. This doubtless is temporary and when stocks are improved, one hopes that efforts to provide vaccine coverage over broad areas of YF virus endemicity can continue, to avoid the lapses in coverage the led to this outbreak.

Individuals planning on traveling to the affected areas in Brazil, or other countries where YF is endemic, should seek vaccination as soon as possible because there is a predicted vaccine shortage starting in mid - to late summer, this year (2017) in the USA.
