Malaria - Turkmenistan: RFI 981216210942

Endemic malaria was eradicated in Turkmenistan by 1960: in the period
1965-1980, only 23 introduced malaria cases were registered in Mary and
Ashgabat velayats.
The malaria situation changed abruptly in June 1998 when the first
indigenous case of vivax malaria was detected in the Kushka district
bordering Afghanistan. In August, 11 additional cases were detected.
By December 1998, 129 cases of malaria had already been detected in 5
foci (details are available on request).
Within the limited resources available, the Ministry of Health of
Turkmenistan responded to the outbreak by reinforcing malaria
surveillance and applying control measures. The epidemiological
situation inTurkmenistan requires immediate and more extensive
actions. The previous stratification of the territory according to
malaria risk indicates that greatest risk for malaria epidemics is in
the Mary province; nevertheless the stratification should be revised
considering the updated information on the distribution and density
of vectors and the possibility of introduction of parasites from the
bordering areas of Afghanistan. The public health and
sanitary-epidemiological infrastructures in the country should be
quickly improved in order to implement anti-malaria and preventive
measures.
External assistance for a national programme integrated into primary
health care activities and health care reforms is needed immediately,
and the Ministry of Health of Turkmenistan asked the WHO Regional
Office for Europe for assistance. With very limited funds available
(provided by the Italian Government), the WHO Regional Office for
Europe immediately organized a "Malaria Workshop" to increase
awareness, and supplied 50 000 tablets of primaquine and 20 000
tablets of chloroquine to prevent a further spread of the disease in
the country (prophylactic treatment in foci must be conducted before
the next transmission season, optimally in February-March).
According to preliminary estimates (details available on request), at
least US$ 35 000 should be made available before February 1999, to
provide assistance to Turkmenistan in carrying out preventive
measures to avoid the further spread of malaria, in revising the
epidemiological situation and in preparing a national plan of action
for malaria prevention. Donors interested in providing support and
Organizations/Institutions interested to participate in this
assistance are invited to contact this Office as soon as possible.
