In the past 2 weeks, 5 Western Washington University [WWU] students have been diagnosed with hand-foot-mouth disease [HFMD], causing Dr Emily Gibson, director of the Student Health Center, to post an advisory on Twitter [Mon 29 Oct 2018].

"We are aware of a small cluster of hand-foot-mouth disease among WWU students -- this virus is more typically seen in young children, but can result in symptoms in adults that can last up to a week, and it is very contagious," Dr Gibson wrote in the Tweet.

In an email [Tue 30 Oct 2018] to The Bellingham Herald, Dr Gibson said Western sees sporadic hand-foot-mouth disease cases most years, but not usually the small cluster they've seen this year [2018]. Dr Gibson also said that larger outbreaks of more than 100 cases have been seen at colleges on the East Coast this fall.

"This is a mild viral illness that typically afflicts young children," Dr Gibson said in the email. "It is now being seen more in college populations among non-immune individuals and is easily spread through coughing, sneezing, or sharing utensils and drinks. The symptoms, which can include fever, body aches, cough, runny nose, and lesions in the mouth, on the hands and feet, usually resolve in 5 to 7 days."

When students are diagnosed, Dr Gibson said, the Student Health Center recommends they remain isolated as possible, including not attending class, to reduce the risk of the virus spreading.

The Student Health Center will continue to monitor for further cases on campus, and Dr Gibson asked students who feel they have symptoms to contact the center.

[The cluster of case as reported above indicates that the HFMD virus is being successfully transmitted in the campus facility and merits investigation of the underlying risk factors to control its spread. - Mod.UBA]
