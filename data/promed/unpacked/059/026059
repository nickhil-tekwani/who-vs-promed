Epidemic outbreak of swine fever reported in central Russia
---------------------------------------------------
An epidemic outbreak of swine fever (hog cholera) has been registered in
the Novoselskoye agricultural production cooperative in the Suzdalskiy
District of the Vladimir Region [east of Moscow].
An ITAR-TASS correspondent today learnt from the deputy chief state
veterinary inspector of the region, Nikolay Mitrofanov, that during last
night and this morning [19 Jan 2005],190 animals have already died.
Urgent measures have been taken to vaccinate all animals and a quarantine
has been set up. Travel to the village of Novoye Selo has been prohibited.
The situation is particularly dangerous, because the focus of the epidemic
outbreak is only a few kilometres from the regional centre.

[According to OIE's epidemiological data base (Handistatus), monthly
animal-disease reports have been sent from Russia to the OIE in each month
of 2004 except November and December; no case of classical swine fever
(CSF) was included. In 2003, the disease was reportedly present in Russia.
Official confirmation and additional data, such as numbers of animals
susceptible, infected, dead, and destroyed, will be appreciated.- Mod.AS]
