Unusual _Salmonella_ Typhimurium from Swedish patients and Italian salami
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
On 9 Dec 2005, the salmonella reference laboratory at
Smittskyddsinstitutet (the Swedish Institute for Infectious Disease
Control, SMI) contacted the epidemiology department after isolating
identical Salmonella strains in 4 fecal samples from 4 patients. The
strain was a unique form of not specifically typeable (NST)
_Salmonella_ Typhimurium [_S. enterica_ serotype Typhimurium -
Mod.LL], which had not previously been observed in Sweden. A week
later the same serotype was found in a food sample of imported
Italian salami that was on sale in Sweden.
In the following weeks, more cases were detected with the same
serotype. In total, 15 cases were notified. Bacteriological analysis
showed 13 of these to have the same strain of _S._ Typhimurium NST. 2
cases were Salmonella-positive and could be epidemiologically linked
to the outbreak. 10 of the patients lived in the Stockholm area,
while the rest were scattered throughout southern Sweden. Patients
ranged in age from 2 to 82 years. 11 were female and 4 were male.
Dates of onset ranged from 9 to 11 December 2005 (For figure see
original URL - Mod.LL]). The patients were interviewed and at least
8 recalled having consumed one brand of Italian salami.
On 16 Dec 2005, the SMI was informed that a food sample had been
taken, following a report of an elderly woman who had eaten salami
and then become ill with salmonellosis a couple of days later. _S._
Infantis had been isolated from this salami sample. To confirm a
Salmonella contamination in the salami, another sample was taken from
an unopened package. Analysis by SMI showed that the salami contained
another serotype, _S._ Typhimurium NST.
The Swedish firm importing the salami was also contacted on 16 Dec
2005. They immediately issued a press release, stating that all
possible affected salami (estimated 1164 kilos) should be withdrawn
immediately, irrespective of production date.
On 21 Dec 2005, the SMI initiated an urgent enquiry through
Enter-net, the international surveillance network for the enteric
infections salmonella and VTEC O157, to find out whether other
European countries had experienced a similar increase in cases of
_S._ Typhimurium NST. There was an immediate response from
authorities in Norway with information about members of a Norwegian
family who were infected with either _S._ Typhimurium NST, _S._
Infantis or both serotypes. The _S._ Typhimurium strains showed the
same unusual phage patterns as the Swedish strains. The Norwegian
patients reported that they had visited Sweden, where they had bought
the salami in Nov 2005.
On 29 Dec 2005, the Swedish authorities issued a RASFF (the European
Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed) alert notification stating that
_S._ Typhimurium had been isolated from Italian salami.
At the beginning of Jan 2006, Italian authorities informed Enter-net
that they had received 12 human isolates of _S._ Typhimurium with the
same phage reactions as the Swedish ones. The date of onset for the
1st Italian case was in Mar 2005 and the cases were from different
regions of Italy. No information about food history was available.
As Italy had submitted a PFGE image, Sweden decided to run the
Swedish isolates on PFGE as well. A comparison of the images showed
the same profile (which had not been previously seen) for both the
human and salami samples.
On 3 Feb 2006 Italy informed the SMI that their veterinary
laboratories had isolated 2 _S._ Typhimurium strains from processed
pork. Both were identical to the outbreak strain.
Thanks to close cooperation by the salami importer and the Swedish
and Italian authorities, no more cases have been observed in Sweden
since 11 Dec 2005.

[The following discussion regarding the nomenclature of Salmonellae
is taken from a bacteriology discussion at the University of
Wisconsin:
<http://www.splammo.net/bact102/102xsal.html>:
"Taxonomically, the species concept has been applied with difficulty
to members of this genus. Through much of the 1970s and 80s, the
3-species concept was generally utilized with the recognition of _S.
typhi_, _S. cholerae-suis_ and _S. enteritidis_. The last-named
species, whose name was derived from a very early-established serovar
(serotype), was basically a dumping ground for the vast majority of
strains isolated, generally from cases of gastroenteritis.
The name "Arizona" appears to have been applied in one form or
another to a group of Salmonella-like organisms since the late 1930s
according to the 7th edition of Bergey's Manual (1957) where it was
called _Paracolobactrium arizonae_. Serological similarity with
Salmonella was usually a note feature along with the atypical (for
Salmonella) tendencies to ferment lactose and liquefy gelatin. Later
names included _Arizona arizonae_, _Arizona hinshawii_ and
_Salmonella arizonae_ before being totally absorbed into the modern
Salmonella scheme as 2 of the recognized subspecies.
Several genetically and biochemically-defined subspecies of
Salmonellae [are?] recognized. However, the "handle" for any isolated
strain of Salmonella is a further subdivision, the serovar -- also
known as serotype -- a designation which reflects the testable
antigenic makeup of the organism, involving the identification of the
cell wall ("O") and flagellar ("H") antigens. Each identified strain
belongs to one of over 2000 recognized serovars. All serovars are
designated with an antigenic formula, a series of numbers and letters
which refer to the recognized antigens. Most serovars also have names
which have been often written for convenience as if they were (but
they really are not) species names -- for example, _Salmonella
typhimurium_. The present convention is to capitalize the serovar
designation and indicate it (without italics) after the genus,
species or subspecies name. As an example, _Salmonella typhimurium_
would now be written _Salmonella sp._ ser. Typhimurium, _Salmonella
enterica_ ser. Typhimurium, or the very cumbersome _Salmonella
enterica_ subsp. enterica ser. Typhimurium."
