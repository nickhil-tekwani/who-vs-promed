Health alert after eyes of CJD victim are transplanted.
Health officials launched an urgent inquiry into transplant procedures
yesterday after it emerged that three patients had received tissue from the
eyes of a Scottish woman with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Screening
guidelines may now be changed.
The corneas and sclera of a patient who died of lung cancer in February,
were cleared for transplant despite a postmortem examination which showed
she had CJD. The results were not passed to the United Kingdom Transplant
Support Service, which arranged for three patients - two men and a woman in
her 80s - to receive the eye tissue. It is not yet clear whether the
results were available when the operations took place.
Organs and tissues for transplant are not routinely tested for CJD because
the disease is so rare, though they are screened for other viruses and
bacteria. Organs such as hearts and livers cannot be tested for the
disease as they must be transplanted within six hours of death and the CJD
test takes months. Corneas can be tested as they can be kept for two
months before transplant. Experts believe CJD can be transmitted though
transplants.
Sam Galbraith, the Scottish Office Health Minister, said his department
would investigate how the incident took place and ways of improving checks
on donated organs: "It is important when we explore the cause of death that
we consider what possible concurrent diseases ... are there. We will try
and tighten up these procedures." The donor, 53, had not had CJD diagnosed
before her death. One of her daughters said she had been behaving
erratically in the weeks before she died. She was said to have been
staggering and falling over, and had become a "senile old lady" in her
early 50s.
The patient was cared for at a Hospice in Stirlingshire after inoperable
lung cancer was diagnosed. Before her death she signed a donor
registration form allowing for her eyes, which were not affected by the
cancer, to be used for transplants. None of her other organs was donated.
A spokesman for the United Kingdom Transplant Support Service said it was
satisfied that the Stirling incident was a one-off and welcomed the
Scottish Office's swift move to investigate it. "We are sure the
transplant was carried out in good faith, but there are always lessons to
be learnt when there is such a serious mix-up."
More than 6,000 cornea transplants take place every year, and this was the
first case of CJD contamination the service had seen, she said.
