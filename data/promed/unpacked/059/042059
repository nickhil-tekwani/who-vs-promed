In the northern Negev city of Arad, Jewish families are battling a disease that is usually found in 3rd-world environments. But the parents of a 4-year-old say that she was diagnosed with bacterial dysentery with _Shigella_ after a week in which their little girl suffered "hell on earth" -- diarrhea, non-stop nosebleeds and sleepless nights for both her and her parents. And the family was not alone: Children in dozens of other families came down with the same symptoms.

In an exclusive interview with JewishPress.com, the parents, who called each other, later discovered that food being served in the public school system was not being inspected or tested daily as it was supposed to be, due to budget cuts in the municipality. They also found that the food, which was arriving in the city from the vendor at the incorrect temperature, and not up to the Health Ministry standard, had caused dozens of children to become sick.

One of the children became so ill that the child was admitted to Soroka Medical Center in Be'er Sheva; that was how the issue came to light. The child's parents contacted others -- and as one set of parents contacted others around town, "it became clear that the common denominator between the preschools was the food."

[_Shigella_ was discovered more than 100 years ago by the Japanese microbiologist Kiyoshi Shiga, for whom the genus is named. There are 4 species: _S. boydii_, _S. dysenteriae_, _S. flexneri_, and _S. sonnei_. _Shigella_ organisms can survive transit through the stomach because they are less susceptible to acid than other bacteria; for this reason, as few as 10 to 100 organisms can cause disease. Ingested bacteria pass into the small intestine where they multiply; large numbers of bacteria then pass into the colon, where they enter the colonic cells. Given its relatively low infectious dose, transmission can occur via contaminated food and water or via direct person-to-person spread, including sexual practices more common in MSM (men who have sex with men). Humans are the only natural reservoir for the disease.

Dysentery (formerly known as flux or the bloody flux) is an inflammatory disorder of the colon, which results in severe diarrhea containing mucus and/or blood in the feces with fever, abdominal pain, and rectal tenesmus (pain while passing the diarrhea). - Mod.LL
