For years, wildlife managers and biologists have contended that the disease brucellosis was spread to Yellowstone National Park and into Montana via wild elk and bison that had visited Wyoming's winter feedgrounds and carried the bacteria north, infecting other elk and bison.

Recent research shows this is not true.

"The data is suggesting very little connection between the Wyoming feedgrounds and Yellowstone and Paradise Valley elk," said Pauline Kamath, a U.S. Geological Survey ecologist who works out of the Northern Rockies Science Center in Bozeman.

Feedgrounds aren't totally scot-free, though. Kamath's research also showed that a large herd of elk that winters in the Madison Valley seems to have been infected by elk that visited a winter elk feeding ground in Idaho.

Kamath presented the results of her study Saturday [17 Jan 2015] at Montana State University during a brucellosis talk organized by Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks. About 50 people attended.

Wyoming was long blamed for Montana's problems because, since 1909, it has concentrated elk on winter feedgrounds, at 1st to keep the elk from eating ranchers' grass, and more recently to artificially sustain wildlife populations for the state's popular elk hunting industry. Last year [2014], there were more than 20 state-sponsored winter feedgrounds in western Wyoming.

It's widely accepted among scientists that brucellosis is more easily spread when animals are concentrated, such as on feedgrounds.

But Kamath's analysis of 250 tissue samples from elk, wild bison, farmed bison and cattle debunks the long-held belief that Montana's wildlife was infected by Wyoming's feedground practices.

Similar genetic research has been used to track whether a dentist infected his patients with HIV as well as to find out that severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was transmitted to humans via an infected bat.

Brucellosis can cause female ungulates to abort their 1st calves as well as infect humans with brucellosis. The most likely transmission source is when uninfected animals or people come into contact with aborted material from an infected host.

Another popularly circulated belief was that the outbreaks of brucellosis in cattle herds in the Paradise Valley, south of Livingston, were due to infected corriente cattle brought in from Mexico or Texas.

"Based on the cases and isolates we have, there are no genetics from outside the (Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem) suggesting that," Kamath said. "It's very unlikely that something from outside is the source."

Over the last 3 years, Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks has enacted measures such as hazing, fencing and lethal removal of elk to try to keep elk and cattle separated to prevent the disease from spreading to cattle. Opponents have charged that there's little evidence that elk are the source of the infections, but Kamath's research shows otherwise.

By examining the _Brucella abortus_ bacteria in tissue from infected animals, Kamath could trace the infection almost like a family tree, showing where it originally came from and where it had split off to different hosts.

"It's pretty accepted that (brucellosis) was introduced into the system when they brought in dairy cattle," Kamath said, marking the 1st time brucellosis was found in the Yellowstone, Paradise Valley areas.

Separate source animals brought brucellosis to Wyoming and Idaho, her analysis showed.

Yet without actually seeing a cow touch infected elk birthing material, Kamath said she couldn't say positively that elk were the source of outbreaks of brucellosis in Montana cattle. "I can just say it was the most likely route of transmission," based on the genetic analysis, she said.

The preponderance of evidence does point to elk as the source of outbreaks, though, said Neil Anderson, FWP lab supervisor in Bozeman.

"I'm a wildlife guy, and I don't want it to come from elk," he said. "But it's hard to say that elk are probably not the source."

In the 1930s the U.S. Department of Agriculture attempted to wipe out brucellosis in all livestock with an intensive eradication and vaccination program. The work was so successful that brucellosis is believed to only persist in the United States in wildlife in Montana, Wyoming and Idaho.

What's odd is that the disease can be traced back in elk and bison in Montana and Wyoming 30 to 40 years, yet it's only in the last 7 years that cattle tested positive for brucellosis in Montana. Why that has happened is unknown. "There's something that's driving this expansion in the system," Kamath said.

Wildlife managers believe it may be higher concentrations of elk in Montana on private and public lands -- up to 2600 elk in some herds -- changes in elk movements, or simply because of increased surveillance.

[Bovine brucellosis (caused by _Brucella abortus_) has caused devastating losses to farmers in the United States over the last century. Collaborative efforts of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the livestock industries, and State animal health authorities achieved brucellosis-free status in 48 states with no known infection in 2002.

The only known focus of _Brucella abortus_ infection left in the nation is in bison and elk, which originally acquired the infection from cattle. According to the superficial description of the research, these introductions were of different sources in Wyoming and Idaho. Unfortunately, the study has not yet been published to allow assessment of whether the conclusions posited are supported by the data.

The bacterium became established in these wildlife species and does not currently pose a threat for their populations. However, it does represent a big concern for domestic livestock. - Mod.PMB
