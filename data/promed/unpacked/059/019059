Health authorities confirmed the death of a young man from [a] hantavirus [infection], becoming the 1st fatal virus victim in the [Santiago] Metropolitan region this year (2015).

The deceased is a 15-year-old youth who died on the afternoon of Tue 8 Dec [2015], in the Las Condes Clinic, due to respiratory insufficiency [hantavirus cardio-pulmonary syndrome].

During the current work day [10 Dec 2015], the Public Health Institute confirmed that the death of the youth was due to a virus [infection], after the tests were carried out.

According to the Subsecretary of Public Health, Jaime Burrows, nationally there have been 20 fatal victims during 2015, and 50 suspected cases, stating that according to the judgment of the [health] officials, the virus [infection] is 40 percent fatal.

According to the figures of the health office, the Bio-Bio region has registered the most suspected cases of hantavirus [infection] (20 cases), followed by Los Lagos (9 cases), La Araucania (7 cases), Maule and Los Rios (6 cases), O'Higgins (4 cases), Aysen (2 cases) and Metropolitana (1 case).

[The above report provides no information about the circumstances under which the youth acquired his hantavirus infection, but it may have been due to exposure to rodent reservoir hosts of the virus or to virus-contaminated rodent excreta. Although cases of hantavirus infections are relatively rare in the Santiago Metropolitan Region in Chile as indicated in the above report, as noted in previous reports from Chile, cases of human hantavirus infections occur fairly frequently in the endemic region of the central and southern coastal areas of Chile. Although not specified in this or previous reports from the region, the hantavirus involved in these cases no doubt is Andes virus. This virus is endemic in Chile, and cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome occur every year. Andes virus is rarely transmitted directly person-to-person and then only with very close physical contact, usually within the family.

Images of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_), the sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus, can be seen at http://www.hantavirus.cl/ecologia_enfermedad/galeria_reservorio.htm.
