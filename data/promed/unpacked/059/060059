Undiagnosed illness, children, Tiruchy, Tamil Nadu
---------------------------------------------------
The report of a new type of fever that affected 66 children at the
Ramakrishna orphanage near Tiruchy has caused concern among health workers
in the state [Tamil Nadu]. Some in fact suspect it could be a zoonotic
disease.

The residents of the orphanage had suddenly fallen ill during mid-April 2005
with high fever, fatigue and vomiting. After few days of fever, a 9-year-old
died. 6 of the children who had become seriously ill and had high fever,
vomiting and shivering were admitted to the Government hospital in Tiruchy,
an Ashram administrator said.

Originally local doctors suspected it could be malaria and sent the blood
samples to Chennai. A team from the Vector-Borne Disease Surveillance Unit
rushed to the spot. The initial tests for malaria showed positive, and the
children were even given anti-malarial drugs. But antigen-antibody tests for
malaria proved negative, it is said.

According to doctors from Tiruchy, experts were rushed in from the Institute
of Vector Control and Zoonotic Diseases, Hosur. More tests were conducted,
and suspicions of the incidence of some variety of a zoonotic disease were
reinforced at every stage.

According to sources, the Joint Director of Vector-Borne Disease Control, A
D Selvakumar, had written to the Commissioner of Veterinary Services
Deenabandhu asking for assistance in confirming the disease and vector. The
suspicion had been that the disease was babesiosis, which had surfaced in
parts of America and Europe in humans.

"It could have been babesiosis or any other zoonotic disease. But the vector
is still not known. There is denial at all stages, as a new disease would
pose challenges," a highly placed source at the Veterinary Services told
this website's newspaper.

But when contacted, J D Selvakumar said that there were [no] more
[suspicions] that it was a zoonotic disease and [it] had simply been a water-
borne disease. However, the government doctors at Tiruchy maintained that
it was malaria and that the children had [responded] when given antimalarial
drugs. Though there had been discussions [about sending the samples] to the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta [USA], no follow-
up has been done.

Incidentally, the team that had come from Hosur informed the Ashram
administrators that it was not malaria and had taken blood samples from all
300 children in the Ashram. They had also taken blood samples of the cattle
that were reared in the Ashram. According to Rajendra Kumar, scientist at
the National Research Centre for Equines in Haryana, who has been doing
extensive research on babesiosis, tests had to be done on other animals in
the vicinity and not just cattle to confirm the disease. "Babesiosis is
common among cattle, but there had been no instance of it spreading to
humans before in India. So it is more likely that it spread from ticks on
infected rodents. It is important to find the vector or agent," he said.

[The article describes an outbreak of a disease with fever and vomiting.
The diagnosis of malaria can easily be confirmed or refuted by an able
microscopist, and it is surprising that this apparently has not been done.
It is not obvious why this should be a zoonotic or vector-borne disease.

Why the authorities speculate that these are the 1st cases of human
babesiosis in India is unclear; there is nothing in the circumstances that
suggests babesiosis, which in any case has never been recorded in India.
Fever and vomiting suggest an enteric infection, which could be caused by
many different agents and most probably would be water- or food-borne.

India has reported many unresolved outbreaks in which rare diseases have
been postulated -- sometimes in India for the 1st time (see refs. below) --
where the obvious seems to have been overlooked and simple, robust routine
diagnostic tests were either not done or were inconclusive.

In this case, we first of all need to have the results of stool and blood
cultures, including any detection of viral nucleic acid in stool; and a time-
space chart of cases day by day. - Mod.EP]
