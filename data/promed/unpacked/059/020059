Crop diseases threaten harvest
------------------------------
This [2010] season is shaping up as a bad one for crop diseases. Last
season's heavy crops have boosted the risk of disease in new-season
cereal crops to the highest level in a long time. Victorian
Department of Primary Industries' Grant Hollaway told growers that
average to above-average rainfall between now and October would
increase the likelihood of serious epidemics of several diseases. He
said it was vital to monitor crops.

"Last year [2009], we had better crops than we've had in recent
years, which has increased the amount of stubble-borne inoculum
present," Dr Hollaway said. "We're looking at wheat diseases such as
stripe rust, stem rust, and yellow leaf spot as well as barley
diseases like spot form of net blotch, net form of net blotch, and
scald. Some diseases are also coming from volunteer cereals, which
carry over stripe rust and stem rust."

Dr Hollaway said it was important for growers to be aware of the
susceptibility or resistance to disease of the varieties they had
sown, and that the further south in higher rainfall areas, [the
higher] the disease risk.

[Stripe rust (also called yellow rust) of cereals is caused by the
fungus _Puccinia striiformis_ var. _striiformis_. It causes yellow
leaf stripes and stunting of plants with yield losses of 40 to 100
percent. The disease affects wheat, some barley varieties, triticale,
and a number of wild grasses. New stripe rust strains with increased
virulence are emerging. In 2010, outbreaks of stripe rust were
reported in Victoria's northern regions earlier than usual (early
August; see link below). Early infections cause more serious damage
to plants and therefore pose an increased risk to crop yields.

Wheat stem rust is caused by the fungus _Puccinia graminis_ f. sp.
_tritici_. Overall yield losses of up to 70 percent are reported, but
some fields are totally destroyed. New races are emerging, and the
most dangerous at present is the Ug99 group of strains which have
overcome the major resistance genes used in our current wheat
varieties. However, none of the Ug99 strains are at this time present
in Australia.

Tan spot (also called yellow leaf spot or blotch) is caused by the
fungus _Pyrenophora tritici-repentis_. It affects wheat but can also
attack barley, triticale, rye, and some grasses. Tan spot may cause
yield losses of up to 50 percent in favourable environments,
especially under minimum tillage systems which are widely used in Australia.

Net blotch of barley is caused by the fungus _Pyrenophora teres_ and
affects only domestic and wild barleys (_Hordeum_ spp.). The disease
causes necrotic areas on leaves leading to significant losses of up
to 20 percent to barley yield around the world. There are 2 types of
this fungus: the net type caused by _P. t._ f. _teres_, and the spot
type caused by _P. t._ f. _maculata_. Highly aggressive new strains
of the net form have emerged in South Australia (see ProMED-mail post
20100323.0921) and are spreading eastwards towards Victoria (see link below).

Scald (or leaf blotch) caused by _Rhynchosporium secalis_ is one of
the most destructive diseases of barley, particularly in wet
conditions. It can decrease yield by up to 40 percent and reduces
grain quality. The pathogen can also cause symptomless seed infection
resulting in a high risk of spread.

Hot spots of these diseases usually appear in crops before widespread
outbreaks occur. Disease management therefore mostly relies on crop
monitoring for timely fungicide applications, as well as use of
cereal cultivars with reduced susceptibility or resistance. For more
information on the diseases see links and previous ProMED-mail posts
listed below.
