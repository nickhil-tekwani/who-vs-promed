The number of people affected by an outbreak of salmonellosis after diners reported suspected food poisoning from a Thornaby pub has now doubled to 20. Public Health England (PHE) confirmed 20 people have now tested positive for the bug. Meanwhile, the number of people who have reported suffering "diarrheal illness" after eating at The Anson Farm has jumped from 34 to 53 since Friday, 22 May 2015.

The toll of those affected by the outbreak could also rise, with PHE confirming that more test results are expected in the coming days. The latest statement from PHE reads: "Experts from the North East Public Health England (PHE) Centre and Stockton Council environmental health team are continuing to investigate reports of diarrheal illness from people who have eaten at Thornaby's Anson Farm pub restaurant."

The family-friendly pub, branded as one of the Farmhouse Inns chain, opened in April 2015.

Dozens of people began reporting suspected food poisoning after eating out at the pub over the weekend of 16-17 May 2015. Stockton Council's environmental health team then opened an investigation alongside PHE. Dr Deb Wilson, consultant in health protection at the PHE North East Centre said investigations were continuing into possible sources of the salmonellosis. She added the venue was "co-operating fully" with the investigation and "implementing a range of control measures requested by environmental health officers."

"People usually get salmonella by eating contaminated food," she said. "Salmonella bacteria live in the gut of many farm animals and can affect meat, eggs, poultry, and milk. Other foods like green vegetables, fruit and shellfish can become contaminated through contact with manure in the soil or sewage in the water. Contamination is also possible if raw and cooked foods are stored together."

Dr Wilson added that salmonellosis can also spread by poor hygiene and not washing hands properly after going to the toilet or handling contaminated food. She advised anyone who was concerned about symptoms including diarrhea, stomach cramps and or vomiting and fever should contact their GP.
