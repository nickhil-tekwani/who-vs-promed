According to recent reports, syphilis cases in Alberta are on the rise and the number of infections is at the highest levels they've been in 70 years.

According to CBC News, there were 765 reported cases of the sexually transmitted infection in the province during the 1st 3 months of 2021 alone. A report from Alberta Health showed that there were 2509 cases in 2020, which represents a 9% increase from 2019.

Speaking about the current caseload in an interview with CBC News, Dr Ameeta Singh, a general infectious diseases practitioner in Edmonton, said that we are currently seeing "the highest rates we've seen since the 1940s, which is, of course, the pre-antibiotic era. Despite all of our advances, we are seeing a horrifying rate of syphilis cases."

In a similar conversation with the Edmonton Journal, she said that the COVID-19 pandemic has been a factor in the rise in cases. Dr Deena Hinshaw, Alberta's chief medical officer of health, also mentioned COVID-19's hand in the issue in a recent statement. "The majority of our public health resources have been directed at the COVID-19 response, as has been necessary. That has come at the cost of not fully working on other threats, like syphilis and opioid deaths," she said.

[Only 17 cases of syphilis were reported in Alberta in 2000 (https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/horrifying-number-of-syphilis-infections-in-alberta-reaching-pre-antibiotic-levels-1.6139240). Cases rose to 160 by 2014, and to over 1500 cases in 2018 (https://www.albertahealthservices.ca/assets/info/hp/phys/if-hp-phys-moh-ez-syphilis-outbreak.pdf). In 2019, Alberta declared a syphilis outbreak with 2265 cases of syphilis reported that year (https://www.albertahealthservices.ca/info/Page17087.aspx). Over 60% of these cases occurred in the city of Edmonton. By 2020, there were 2509 cases in the province (https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/horrifying-number-of-syphilis-infections-in-alberta-reaching-pre-antibiotic-levels-1.6139240). Cases of syphilis were said to be observed across gender, sexual orientation, and age groups. There had been over 70 cases of congenital syphilis since 2014 (https://www.albertahealthservices.ca/info/Page17087.aspx).

Alberta is divided into 5 health zones: the North Zone (population, 478 979); the Edmonton Zone (population, about 1.3 million); the Central Zone (population, 470 490); the Calgary Zone (over 1.5 million); and the South Zone (population, 298 169). The map showing the location of these 5 zones can be found at https://www.albertahealthservices.ca/ahs-map-ahs-zones.pdf. Edmonton is the provincial capital city, located in the center of the province. The city of Calgary is located about 299 km (186 mi) south of Edmonton and approximately 240 km (150 mi) north of the Canada-United States border (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calgary).

Of the 5 health zones in Alberta, 4 zones saw syphilis rates at least double, if not triple or quadruple in 2018, compared with the year before, the exception being Calgary (https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/alberta-syphilis-rates-calgary-outlier-sti-infections-1.5231659). The Edmonton Zone had one of the highest case counts, incidence rates, and percentage increase in 2018 compared to 2017 with 977 cases (75.4 cases per 100 000), an increase of 305.4 per cent in 2018 compared to 2017. Syphilis also increased in 2018 in the other Alberta health zones: in the North Zone -- 208 cases (43.4 cases per 100 000), an increase of 324.5 per cent; Central Zone -- 88 cases (18.7 cases per 100 000), an increase of 266.7 per cent; South Zone -- 31 cases (10.4 cases per 100 000), an increase of 138.5 per cent; and Calgary Zone -- 206 cases (13.3 cases per 100 000), an increase of only 7.3 per cent (https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/syphilis-alberta-health-outbreak-warning-1.5213851). The dramatic increase in 4 of the 5 Alberta health zones remained mostly unexplained at the time (https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/alberta-syphilis-rates-calgary-outlier-sti-infections-1.5231659).

However, not mentioned in the news report above, illicit drug use, namely methamphetamine, was cited as a contributing factor to the increase in syphilis cases in Edmonton in 2019 (ProMED post Syphilis - Canada (07): (AB) incr. incidence, congenital, meth use in Edmonton 20191209.6829997). Also, in 2019 ProMED reported on an outbreak of primary and secondary syphilis in the neighboring Canadian province of Saskatchewan, as well as in Canadian provinces of Ontario and Manitoba, that affected in part Indigenous young people and illicit drug use, namely methamphetamine, was cited as a contributing factor (ProMED-mail posts Syphilis - Canada (08): (SK,ON) incr. incidence, indigenous, women, meth use 20191212.6836885 and Syphilis - Canada (02): (MB) incr. incidence, meth., IDU, women, congenital 20190307.6354666).

Transmission of syphilis in injection drug users may occur as a consequence of sharing a needle/syringe contaminated with infected blood from somebody who has primary or secondary syphilis (https://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/archive/newsrel/health/04-28TransmissionSyphilis.asp), but more likely the infection is acquired by the practice of exchanging drugs for sex and high-risk sexual behaviors, such as multiple partners and inconsistent condom (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/wr/mm6806a4.htm).

More information on the use of illicit drugs or other factors contributing to the current outbreak in Alberta would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.ML
