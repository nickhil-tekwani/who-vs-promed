The 20 "sentinel chickens" based at Gooramadda, near Rutherglen, are
tested each week for mosquito-borne viruses such as Ross River fever,
Barmah Forest virus and potentially deadly Murray Valley
encephalitis. They are one of 10 flocks placed in towns along the
Murray River, including Cobram and Wodonga, which serve as an early
warning system about the threat of disease to humans. The flocks have
been strategically located so that they are in a place where there
are plenty of mosquitoes and where they are close to a population of people.

Near-perfect breeding conditions over the past 3 months have seen
massive increases in mosquito numbers across the Border and North
East. In the past 3 weeks, 3 cases of Ross River fever [virus
infection] and one of Barmah Forest virus [infection] have been
reported in the Hume region.

[A 4 May 2010 report indicated that the wetter weather last year
(2010) has led to a 4-fold increase in Ross River virus infections as
well as Barmah Forest virus infections in the Riverina Murray region
(see ProMED-mail archive no. 20100513.1560). The occurrence of Ross
River fever virus and Barmah Forest virus infections in Victoria are
a sound reason to carry out a sentinel chicken monitoring program. In
Eastern Australia, including Victoria state, unusually heavy rains
with flooding may account for increased mosquito breeding.
