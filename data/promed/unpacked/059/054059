Tanzania has started a vaccination campaign against anthrax, an infection that affects livestock, wildlife and human beings, an official said [Wed 4 Oct 2017]. Bedan Masuruli, registrar of the Tanzania Veterinary Council, said the campaign, launched in northern Tanzania's safari capital Arusha, targets thousands of livestock in a new drive to fight against anthrax, an infection caused by the bacterium _Bacillus anthracis_.

He said that cattle, sheep, and goats are highly at risk for anthrax, hence they will be vaccinated during a one-week campaign, which is being supported by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO).

The disease is more serious in areas located in the Great Rift Valley in northern Tanzania, including 2 districts of Arusha, Ngorongoro and Monduli, Masuruli said.

People in such areas, predominantly Maasai pastoralists, had been susceptible to the deadly disease as they had tendencies of eating raw meat of livestock succumbed to unknown diseases, he said.

"That's why even in this campaign, we're focusing on 2 districts which are dominated by pastoralists, who had been eating meat without taking precautionary measures," Masuruli said. Masuruli called for more awareness education, particularly in areas highly affected by the disease.

In September [2017], an outbreak of anthrax, which occurs in 4 forms -- skin, inhalation, intestinal, and injection -- killed at least 42 hippopotami in south-central Tanzania's famed Ruaha National Park.

[The Tanzanian veterinary service is to be congratulated on initiating this control programme in Arusha. Hopefully it will be successful and other provinces and regions will be encouraged to follow. One of the characteristics of anthrax control and surveillance is that if it is done efficiently it results in eradication. Though the spores are robust, they are not immortal. In my experience the annual spore mortality rate is around 30 percent. So make sure to know of any suspect death and burn the carcass and the contaminated bloody soil, and proactively vaccinate, and within 5-6 years eradication is on the horizon.

Tanzania has suffered for many years with enzootic anthrax in their wildlife parks. As yet we have no simpler cheap methodology for vaccinating wildlife. As a result it is very important to keep the surrounding livestock from grazing within the parks. Easier said than done. Anyway we wish them every success and FAO for their vision.
