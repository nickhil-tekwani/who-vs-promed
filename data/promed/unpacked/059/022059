In Niger, Nigeria's northern neighbour, officials are investigating the deaths
of 2 birds.
No human cases have been confirmed in Africa, and bird cases have been
confirmed only in Nigeria.
But Niger, the world's least-developed nation, has said it was investigating 2
birds found dead in a market in Zinder, near the Nigerian border.
Juan Lubroth, a senior animal health officer at the United Nations' Food and
Agriculture Organisation, said experts still do not know if it was avian flu,
but "it's likely that it's H5N1. It's highly suspected cases of H5N1."
