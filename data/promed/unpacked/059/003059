In one of our previous articles on Mandiana, you will recall the
discovery of yellow fever [YF] virus in the border area with the
Ivory Coast. This was confirmed in the most authoritative way; since
[23 Nov 2009], a case of yellow fever had been detected in the
district Malinke, sub-prefecture Saladou.

This voice is that of the Minister of Public Health and Sanitation,
the Army medical officer Dr Aboubacar Cherif Diaby. In his address
this Monday, [4 Jan 2010], he has confirmed the presence of the virus
in the Mandiana prefecture. According to Dr. Aboubacar Cherif Diaby,
the 1st case was detected, then 6 other suspects were reported by the
health services in another district. An emergency team has been sent
to the area by the MSHP [Ministry of Public Health and Sanitation].
[This team] made an assessment in the suspected districts. This
helped to identify the presence of the virus.

The confirmation has been made thanks to the assistance of the
Pasteur Institute in Dakar. It is undeniable that yellow fever has
caused large epidemics in Africa and America and is in the Wassolon
area [an area that covers a region on both sides of the border
between Guinea and Mali. - Mod.MPP]

According to the Minister of Health, he was notified by WHO that
yellow fever was circulating in Mininyan, in the Odienne region of
Republic of Cote d'Ivoire. What was said with assurance was that
Mandiana prefecture on the border with Cote d'Ivoire is currently
affected with a yellow fever epidemic.

Faced with this situation, the Director of the Health Department has
announced the launching of a routine vaccination campaign in the
Mandiana area in January 2010, with collaboration with traditional
partners. The Minister said that the campaign will aim to effectively
control the epidemic of yellow fever in the Mandiana district, to
make a safety ring [zone] around the affected area to avoid the
spread [of the virus] out of the area and to vaccinate people older
than 9 months. The vaccination campaign against yellow fever will
cover sectors, villages, districts, and sub-prefectures in Mandiana,
especially along the border [with Cote d'Ivoire]. It constitutes a
serious threat in endemic areas.

He seized the opportunity to invite anyone who has noticed signs that
resemble those of flu -- the onset is sudden with high fever,
headaches, various digestive disorders, diffuse muscle pain -- to go
to the closet health center.

Because of the absence of [effective] treatment, it is essential to
prevent the disease through vaccination. The campaign will also
reinforce the use of yellow fever vaccine against yellow fever in the
routine activities of the expanded immunization program while
strengthening epidemiological surveillance for this infection.

Recall that, according to experts, yellow fever is a viral disease
(caused by a virus) transmitted by the bite of an _Aedes_ mosquito.
In most cases, the disease is benign. Incubation lasts from 3-6 days;
there is no effective treatment, but drugs can be prescribed to treat
symptoms (fever and any pain with antipyretics and analgesics such as
paracetamol or codeine). We speak of symptomatic treatment.

Aspirin, in turn, must be avoided. In most cases, the disease ends
after 24-72 hours of development. The temperature drops, and the
recovery time is short and without sequelae. Unfortunately, this
lull-period of remission sometimes precedes the beginning of the
severe form of the disease-toxic period. A few hours or days later,
the fever rises, and the patient may suffer from gastrointestinal
bleeding, jaundice (hence the name yellow fever) and severe kidney
problems. It is followed by delirium, convulsions and coma. The
outcome of this serious disease form is often fatal.

Vaccination is contraindicated in children under 6 years, pregnant
women, immuno-compromised individuals and certain patients with
allergies. For these 4 types of travelers, staying in endemic areas
should be avoided. If travel is absolutely necessary, the physician
at the vaccination center should assess the benefits of vaccination
based on the risk. Note that even if there is a waiver or
contraindication to the vaccine, a medical certificate is required
for entry to many countries.

The clinical manifestations of infection range from mild symptoms to
serious illness, potentially fatal. The term "yellow" is explained by
the jaundice that affects some patients. The disease is caused by the
virus of yellow fever or yellow fever virus, which belongs to the
flavivirus group. Vaccination involves administering one [dose to]
every person living in high risk areas. Its purpose is to protect
beneficiaries over a 10-year period.

The government needs to move quickly, because people's health is priceless.

[The YF outbreak along the border of Guinea and Cote d'Ivoire is
another illustration that international borders pose no
epidemiological barriers to the spread of emerging diseases and of
the need for close international collaboration in controlling them.
