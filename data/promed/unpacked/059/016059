Bird die-off in La Pampa (Argentina) under investigation
-----------------------------------------------
Last Saturday (21 Jan 2006), it was reported that sanitary authorities were
trying to determine the cause of the deaths of 500 birds that were found in
a lagoon in La Pampa province.
Birds were found in a lagoon located within a privately owned piece of land
in Guatrache, in the Pampa, 150 km south of the province's capital city,
and specialists are investigating whether this corresponds to insecticide
poisoning or a botulism outbreak.
"It is a very important figure, and it is not only one species of bird,"
Ms. Veronica Campo, officer from the Provincial Ecology Sub-secretariat,
said. Technical personnel took soil and water samples, and they also
collected dozens of dead birds, mainly ducks and eaglets, so that
necropsies will be performed in the Sanitation and Agro-Alimentary Quality
Service (SENASA, according to its Spanish initials) Laboratories in Buenos
Aires.
Sanitary authorities blocked the area in order to impede the entrance of
cattle to the affected area, and they also implemented preventive measures
in order to prevent other species being affected.

[If this is botulism poisoning, then a primary sanitary measure would be
picking up dead carcasses. Other birds will eat the maggots that form on
the carcasses and become intoxicated from the botulism-filled maggots.
Cattle might ingest these but are not as likely to do so as are birds.
Determining whether this is an insecticide is equally important. Any
pellets or granules of the insecticide may well serve to kill more birds,
and cattle are just as likely to consume this poison if found, so it is
wise to prohibit cattle from entering the area.
We look forward to an official report on the cause of the demise of the
birds. - Mod.TG]
