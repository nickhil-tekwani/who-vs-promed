The Health Ministry has declared an outbreak of meningococcal disease in Fiji. Over recent years Fiji has had an increase in cases of meningococcal disease. Prior to 2016, there were 1 to 10 cases per year reported. In 2016 there were 29 cases, and in 2017 there were 48 cases. In 2018, there have been 18 cases as of [21 Feb 2018].

Even with the recent increase in cases, meningococcal disease remains uncommon in Fiji; however, this disease has a high death rate. According to WHO, without appropriate medical treatment, up to 5 per cent of people who get the disease will die. Most people who get the disease, and are treated appropriately, will recover fully; however 10-15 per cent will still die, and around 2 per cent will have permanent disabilities, including severe brain damage.

In 2017, 14.4 per cent of all people who had meningococcal disease in Fiji died. To put this in context, the death rate for dengue fever in Fiji is 0.4-0.6 per cent annually, even during outbreaks. This is why the Ministry of Health and Medical Services is taking nationwide action.

The meningococcal disease bacteria are not easily transmitted but are spread from person to person via transfer of saliva or spit. This can happen when a person with the bacteria coughs on an uninfected person, or deeply kisses an uninfected person on the mouth. It may also be spread through sharing of drinks from the same glass/cup, water bottle or bowl, such as kava or taki alcohol at a nightclub. Babies and children under the age of 5 frequently put things into their mouths, therefore they are also at risk of getting the bacteria.

[The news report above fails to characterize the patients with invasive meningococcal disease; for example, were they part of the population at increased risk for meningococcal disease because of age; a medical condition (complement component deficiencies), HIV infection, or absent spleen; travel or residence in countries in which the disease is common; or being a college student or military recruit living in a residence hall. We are also not told the meningococcal serogroups involved.

However, ProMED-mail reported in 2017 that a total of 8 cases, including 1 fatal case, of meningococcal serogroup C meningitis occurred on the campus of St John's College, a Roman Catholic secondary school located on the Fiji island of Ovalau (see alsos below). In 2015, 590 students were enrolled at the school, the majority coming to Fiji from Papua New Guinea (http://www.sjcawaci.school.fj).

In Fiji, infant, childhood, adolescent immunization schedules do not include a meningococcal vaccine: http://www.health.gov.fj/PDFs/policy/EPI%20Policy%202013-2016.pdf.

Fiji is an island nation of more than 330 islands in Melanesia in the South Pacific Ocean about 2000 km (1300 miles) north east of New Zealand's North Island (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiji). Fiji is divided into 4 major divisions, Central, Eastern, Northern, and Western, and 14 provinces. For a map of Fiji's divisions, see http://www.geographicguide.com/pictures/map-fiji.jpg.
