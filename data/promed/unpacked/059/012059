Pennsylvania reports cases of new flu strain
--------------------------------------------
HARRISBURG: The state Department of Health is reporting 4 confirmed and 6 probable human cases of influenza due to a new strain of influenza virus. The strain known as H3N2v is typically associated with swine, but the departments of health and agriculture said handling or eating pork products presents no risk of exposure to influenza. The influenza cases occurred among youths participating in the Huntingdon County Fair last week. There are no reported hospitalizations, and no evidence so far that the new flu strain is spreading from person-to-person, health officials said.

The same virus has recently caused illness in Indiana and Ohio, mostly among children who were participants or visitors at agricultural fairs. Health secretary Dr Eli N Avila said people should take steps to protect their health if they're visiting or exhibiting in a county fair in the coming weeks, especially if they are at high risk for illness. He said fair attendees should wash their hands after visiting areas with live animals and avoid carrying food or drink or putting things in their mouth while in those areas.

Health officials said people at high risk of influenza complications should consider avoiding areas where live pigs are displayed. Those at high risk include:
- children less than 5 years of age;
- people 65 years of age and above;
- pregnant women; and
- people with certain chronic medical conditions or weakened immune systems.

Officials said symptoms of H3N2v influenza are similar to seasonal flu, and include fever, coughing, fatigue, and lack of appetite. Other influenza symptoms may include a runny nose, sore throat, muscle aches, eye irritation, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea. Anyone with flu-like illness who has been in contact with live animals including pigs at agricultural fairs or on farms in the week before they got sick should contact their health care provider.

[As in all the other states reporting cases of A(H3N2)v influenza virus infection, illness has been mild and there has been no record of onward human-to-human transmission of infection. It is likely that human cases of A (H3N2)v influenza virus infection will be reported from most, if not all, states hosting agricultural fairs.
