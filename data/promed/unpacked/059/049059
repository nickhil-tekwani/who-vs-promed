A case of anthrax in Mississippi livestock has been detected in Coahoma County near Clarksdale. The State Veterinarian quarantined the premises based on the report of the disease by the local veterinarian. Samples from one of the 2 affected animals were submitted to the Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, which confirmed the diagnosis. The carcasses have been cremated, and the rest of the cattle have been vaccinated by the attending veterinarian as required by law.

Anthrax is a naturally occurring disease caused by the bacteria _Bacillus anthracis_ found in many parts of the world. In Mississippi the disease is occasionally found in Western Delta counties when weather conditions are favorable. Typically this occurs when there is spring flooding followed by hot, dry weather, although as demonstrated by this case, it can occur anytime. The last documented cases in Mississippi were in 1990 and 1991.

[After such a long period without outbreaks it is usually safe to presume that any new outbreak has followed upon soil moving activities, which have disturbed an old anthrax cattle grave. The state veterinarian is presently at a meeting in Starkville but an update and clarification has been requested from him.

Clarksdale is on the east bank of the Mississippi River in northern Mississippi; it can be seen on the map at http://www.fallingrain.com/world/US/MS/Clarksdale.html.
