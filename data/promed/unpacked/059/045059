African swine fever has not disappeared. Last year [2022], outbreaks of the disease were observed in several districts of Vidzeme [one of the Historical Latvian Lands], including Smiltenes. The Food and Veterinary Service (PVD) states that the 2nd wave of the disease has already been experienced in Vidzeme this year [2023]. To prevent its spread, the only solution, for now, is to continue hunting wild boars.

"If we talk about African swine fever (ASF), it must be said that it has not disappeared anywhere in Vidzeme either. Yes, now there are more cases of detection of wild boars with ASF compared to previous years. At the moment, such hot spots are Kauguru and Vaidava parishes in Valmiera municipality, as well as Raiskuma and Stalbe parishes in Cesu municipality. In mid-December [2022], one corpse of a pig infected with the ASF virus was found in Launkalne parish on the side of the Vidzeme highway. The wild boar was likely hit by a car, the corpse was reported by a hunter, and when it was examined in the laboratory, the ASF virus was detected," says Marcis Ulmanis, head of the Northern Vidzeme administration of the Food and Veterinary Service.

Renars Apinis, head of the Vidzeme hunting association, says that the collective is successful in enforcing the wild boar hunting limit. The collective has taken out 53 hunting permits for wild boars this hunting season, 44 of them have already been hunted. Just removed 10 more to have on hand if needed. "We have hunting areas mainly in Brantu parish, but also a little in Launkalne parish. We are hunting in order to fulfill the minimum set in the country for limiting the population of wild boars. Of course, as it should be, blood samples of all wild boars that are hunted are sent to the laboratory. It is to be welcomed that it has been done for several years now, so we can rest assured that the animals have been healthy, and therefore their meat is also safe for consumption. Fortunately, from the boars hunted by our team, no one was infected or had detectable antibodies to African swine fever. But we must continue to be vigilant because it can only be a matter of time. Because even when the 1st wave of the disease hit, we thought it wouldn't affect us, but it did. In addition, as we have seen, animals also flee from plague-affected areas. It was a few years ago when at one point we had a sudden increase in wild boars. Then they had fled from 2 sides, from the neighboring territories, where the swine fever had spread more rapidly at that moment," he says and adds that he also heard about the dead wild boar found in December [2022] in the territory of Launkalne parish, which shows that the situation is not clear-cut and is even there is a reason to think that this year we will have to hear about such cases more often in our country as well.

"We still need to know about the wild boar killed in Launkalne parish, whether it was infected with African swine fever or whether antibodies to this disease were detected. If the wild boar was infected, then it is clear that swine fever is present here as well, because then the disease spreads very quickly," Apinis shares his thoughts.

Aigars Verzemnieks, the representative of the hunting sports club "Grundzale", also says that he is not aware of any new cases of illness. The collective has hunting areas in Grundzale and Zvartava parishes. "I don't have information on how many wild boar permits are usually taken out, but those limits are being met. If in some place we observe greater damage by wild boars or they have multiplied considerably, then we ask for more of these hunting permits and we usually get them. This season, I have not heard that African swine fever was confirmed for any wild boar in our area, but during the 1st wave of the disease, I happened to hunt wild boars infected with this disease. So we can't predict anything even now. We have to hope that our side will not be affected by a new wave of illness," says the hunter with many years of experience.

He believes that everything in nature is in balance. "Processes in nature already put everything in place by themselves. If roe deer multiply, deep snow may fall and, accordingly, animals have more difficult survival conditions. It's the same with wild boars. African swine fever is also taking its toll. If the population is too dense, diseases multiply. Nothing happens just the same," adds Verzemnieks.

Ulmanis explains that the spread of ASF is closely related to the increase in the population (number) of wild boars. "Right now we can talk about the 2nd wave of the disease in Vidzeme. When ASF first appeared in Vidzeme in 2014, it reduced the wild boar population relatively rapidly, pigs died from the disease, and in some places even disappeared altogether. Currently, the number of wild boars has grown again quite large. If the ASF virus appears, then the disease begins with new vigor. Hunters feed wild boars, do not hunt in large enough quantities and the disease is back. The fact that the disease has occurred once does not mean that it cannot return. A gap of a couple of years without a disease in a particular parish does not mean that it has completely disappeared," he explains.

Last year [2022], a total of 1274 cases of the disease were detected in Latvia, 30 counties and 242 parishes were affected by the disease. "On this background, it can be said that Valkas and Smiltenes regions are relatively calm, but looking at the direction of the spread of the disease, everything is still ahead in Vidzeme," concludes Ulmanis, and adds that Latvia is not the only country where ASF is raging. The disease has been detected in 10 other European countries, including Germany, Poland, Romania, and Bulgaria.

One of the most important conditions for limiting/eliminating this disease is to reduce the number of susceptible animals (wild boars) in Latvia. And this period with such a low number of wild boars must be long enough -- several years. This is also important for hunters to understand. Otherwise, it may happen that ASF will wander around here in the woods for a long time.

Regarding the limitation of the wild boar population, the State Forestry Service (VMD) predicts that the minimum number of wild boars will most likely be hunted this hunting season.

This year's wild boar hunting season will end on 31 Mar 2023. As of 4 Jan 2023, the country received information about the hunting of 20 500 wild boars. Hunters must submit a blood sample and the tip of the tail from all wild boars they hunt. Hunters receive a compensation of 30 euros [about USD 32.3] for each kit (valid blood sample and tail tip) brought for examination. If ASF is detected, the carcass of the infected wild boar is destroyed, but the hunters are entitled to a compensation of 50 euros [about USD 53.80].

It has been reported that African swine fever also affected domestic pigs last year [2022], when the disease was detected in 6 farms, as a result of which 1500 animals had to be eliminated.

[African swine fever (ASF) is a devastating hemorrhagic fever of pigs with extremely high mortality rates. In affected countries, it causes huge economic losses. The importance of wildlife reservoirs for disease maintenance has been clearly demonstrated. In Eastern Europe, the disease spread into the local wild boar populations. - Mod.PMB]
