[No data are presented in the report above on the proportion of the 399 encephalitis cases in the area due to Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) infections or from other causes. The most recent cases fall within the usual season of the year for JEV transmission.

Previous reports from this area also associated encephalitis cases with contaminated water. However, revisiting the comments made by Dr T Jacob John, he mentioned that cases in this area early in the year may be due to a Reye-like syndrome. In a 24 Jun 2014 comment (ProMED-mail archive no 20140625.2563561) concerning the Reye-like syndrome, he stated that "the disease is undoubtedly hypoglycemic encephalopathy (with blood glucose levels below 40 in about half the children in whom testing was done), and lower than 80 in 80-85 percent. The lesson was to give 10 percent dextrose infusion as soon as possible after drawing blood for glucose measurement. Pediatricians who did this tell me that children given 10 percent dextrose within a short period of onset tend to recover within a few hours and are well to go home the next day." In another comment on 3 Aug 2014 (see ProMED-mail archive no 20140804.2656983), he noted, "I understand that West Nile virus is also present in that region, and some AES [acute encephalitis syndrome] may indeed be West Nile encephalitis." He indicated that JEV cases occur later in the year during the typical JEV transmission season.

The report above provides no information about the JEV vaccination status of the population in the affected areas, or the number of cases laboratory confirmed as JEV infections.
