Lassa fever has continued to spread in Nigeria, with 1081 suspected cases and 90 deaths in 18 states, according to a press statement released by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) on Tuesday [27 Feb 2018]. According to the agency, following the increasing number of Lassa fever cases, within a week, 54 new confirmed cases were recorded from 8 states, with 10 new deaths in confirmed cases from 5 states.

"From 1 Jan-25 Feb 2018, a total of 1081 suspected cases and 90 deaths have been recorded actively in Edo, Ondo, Bauchi, Nasarawa, Ebonyi, Anambra, Benue, Kogi, Imo, Plateau, Lagos, Taraba, Delta, Osun, Rivers, FCT, Gombe and Ekiti states, making 18 states. This year [2018], 69 per cent of all confirmed cases are from Edo (43 per cent) and Ondo (26 per cent) states, and 14 health care workers have been affected in 6 states: Ebonyi -7, Nasarawa -1, Kogi -1, Benue -1, Ondo -1 and Edo -3) with 4 deaths (Ebonyi -3 and Kogi -1)," said the report.

Lassa fever is an acute viral haemorrhagic illness, transmitted to humans through contact with food or household items contaminated by infected rodents. Person-to-person transmission can also occur, particularly in hospital environments in the absence of adequate infection control measures.

The agency further stated that since the start of 2018, 325 cases have been classified: 317 confirmed cases, 8 probable cases with 72 deaths (64 lab confirmed and 8 probable); the case fatality rate in confirmed and probable cases is 22 per cent.

"There is need for the public to ensure and maintain adequate personal hygiene and environmental sanitation at all times as part of prevention and control measures against the spread of Lassa fever in the state,'' said Jide Idris, commissioner for health, in an interview with Business Day. The commissioner urged people to dispose of refuse properly at designated dump sites and not into the drainage system and to store food items in rodent-proof containers. "Currently, Lassa fever [cases] are being followed up on, with testing across 3 laboratories in the country. The NCDC [Nigeria Center for Disease Control] is working in collaboration with The Alliance for International Medical Action (ALIMA) and the World Health Organization (WHO), scaling up its support of the response at national and state levels."

[The number of Lassa fever cases and deaths continues to rise, from 913 suspected cases and 73 deaths as of 18 Feb 2018 to the 1081 suspected cases and 90 deaths reported above, and the number of states involved has increased by one to 18. Unfortunately, the number of cases among health care workers is now 14.

Halting the acquisition of Lassa fever virus infection at its source -- at the village level -- is not easy. As noted previously, getting local people to understand that virus transmission to humans occurs when people are in contact with the reservoir rodent host, the multimammate mouse (in the genus _Mastomys_) or its excreta can be difficult. Preventing this contact requires understanding that leads to action. Rodent control and prevention of contact with rodent excreta has to be undertaken at the village level with individual households. This requires an extensive and continuous public education effort.

As noted in the previous posts, cases of Lassa fever in Nigeria continue to increase. In Lassa fever endemic areas of Nigeria, the current 6 month dry season is when most cases occur. One can expect additional cases this year [2018] up through June 2018, and sporadic cases thereafter. Lassa fever remains a problem in Nigeria because the virus is endemic there. Transmission of the virus also occurs in health facilities when personal protective equipment is not employed, and barrier-nursing practices are not adequate to protect staff from blood and secretions of infected patients. Although no vaccine is available, Ribavirin has been used to successfully treat patients and is most effective if patients are treated early in the course of infection.
