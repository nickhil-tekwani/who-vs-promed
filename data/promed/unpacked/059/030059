Dengue fever kills at least 33 in Caribbean
---------------------------------------------------
Mosquito-borne dengue fever is reaching epidemic stages across the
Caribbean. Dozens of deaths have been reported, and health
authorities are concerned it could get much worse as the rainy season
advances. The increase in cases is blamed on warm weather and an
unusually early rainy season, which has produced an explosion of
mosquitoes. Health officials say the flood of cases is straining the
region's hospitals.

In the Dominican Republic, where at least 27 deaths have been
reported, hundreds of health workers and soldiers went door-to-door
Saturday [17 Jul 2010] to warn about the virus and destroy mosquito
breeding areas.

Hospitals in Trinidad, where one death has been reported, are running
out of beds, and Puerto Rico is facing what officials say could be
its worst dengue outbreak in more than a decade.

"We are having a really large epidemic," said Kay Tomashek,
epidemiology section chief of the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention's dengue branch in Puerto Rico. At least 5 people have
died in the U.S. Caribbean territory, and 6300 suspected cases had
been reported as of mid-July. Only 100 more cases were reported
during the same period in 1998, the island's worst dengue outbreak.
By the end of that year, it had sickened 17 000 and killed 19.

Health officials fear the virus, which had once disappeared from the
United States, also could gain a foothold there. Test results for a
suspected case in the Miami area came back negative last week, but a
recent study found 5 percent of Key West residents show evidence they
had been exposed to the virus.

In the last 3 days [13-15 Jul 2010], 4 children have died, bringing
to 11 the number of victims in the area since January [2010]. The
deputy health minister, Jose Rodriguez Aybar, met here with the
directors of 5 public hospitals to announce a campaign against the
disease in 15 communities of Santiago province. Rodriguez said that
the initiative is aimed at eliminating breeding grounds for the
mosquito that transmits dengue fever [virus]. The operation will be
staffed by 300 soldiers trained for the task, the head of the army's
2nd Brigade, Gen. Luis Anibal Jimenez, said.

According to figures provided by the Health Ministry, at the
beginning of this month [July 2010] the number of fatalities caused
by dengue nationwide was 22, with a total of 4098 cases of dengue
confirmed. The director of Arturo Grullon Pediatric Hospital in
Santiago city, Rosa Morel, told reporters that 2 children ages 7 and
8 died of the illness on Wednesday [14 Jul 2010]. Last Monday [12 Jul
2010] a 7-year-old girl died at the same hospital, Morel said, adding
that every day 9 or 10 minors are admitted to Grullon with possible
symptoms of the ailment. The nurses working at Grullon, the only
pediatric hospital in the northern Dominican Republic, suspended
their activities for an hour on Friday [16 Jul 2010], saying that
they were incapable of attending the vast number of dengue patients
admitted to the medical center.

The president of the northern section of the Dominican medical
society, Manase Pena, asked authorities to tell people the truth
about the cases of dengue registered in the area. He said the area's
hospitals and clinics are full of patients with probable symptoms of
the disease.

The president of the Federation of Neighborhood Boards of Santiago,
Andres Ramos, complained that people were confused about how to
prevent dengue because the authorities have not explained it to them.
He said that starting Friday [16 Jul 2010] community leaders will go
from house to house telling people about the preventive measures they
can take to ward off contagion of the disease. The provincial
director of public health, Ramon Martinez Henriquez, acknowledged
that the illness is ravaging the northern region, but attributed the
problem to the accumulation of garbage on city streets.

[3] Puerto Rico

The dengue epidemic in Puerto Rico, declared in February [2010], has
left 5 people dead so far this year. It has been worsened by the
rains, causing an increase of about 400 new cases reported per week,
according to official data. The government blames the rise to heavy
rains experienced by the country since May, and the presence of 3
different serotypes of the virus.

The latter, says U.S. Secretary of the Department of Health of Puerto
Rico, Lorenzo Gonzalez, means "we have more people susceptible to the
virus and it is likely that a given person can become infected on
more than one occasion [with a different virus serotype. - Mod.TY] in
the year."

The increase of cases occurred before the start of the dengue high
season in Puerto Rico, which is officially from August through
November.

On the other hand, Gonzalez noted the need to make the people aware
of the risk of disease, for which his department has requested
federal funds. "Contrary to the feeling of urgency that we saw in the
public to combat [influenza] H1N1, when citizens went to get
vaccinated and took personal supplies [of medications ?], we know
that has not been the same with dengue, he explained. In this
situation, the Department of Health has asked Puerto Ricans to "take
emergency measures to combat the epidemic." He reminded everyone that
the areas that tend to become breeding grounds for mosquitoes, are
the trash bins and, in general, any place where water is stored such
as unused plastic pools or watering containers for animals.

At least one Princes Town resident was admitted suffering from the
dreaded dengue virus at the San Fernando General Hospital (SFGH) on
Friday [16 Jul 2010]. Speaking to Sunday Newsday from beneath his
mosquito-netted bed on Ward 15 yesterday, the patient, who lives at
St Julien Village, Princes Town, said a blood test taken at the
hospital on Friday morning [16 Jul 2010] had returned positive. The
man, who is employed at Claxton Bay said he started to feel unwell on
Tuesday evening [13 Jul 2010] and developed severe headaches, fever
and body pains and was taken to the hospital by relatives on Friday
morning. He was immediately placed on IV drips and admitted to Ward
15 where he was surrounded by 3 other men all lying under mosquito
nets.

Ag Medical Director, Dr Anand Chatoorgoon, in a telephone interview,
said he was unaware of any new cases of dengue fever at the hospital.

Meanwhile, in a statement, the SWRHA noted that several measures had
been put in place to deal with the overcrowding situation at the
hospital including the addition of 15 beds and the establishment of a
special dengue clinic at the Accident and Emergency department to
provide "daily follow up care for patient with symptoms who are
discharged."

The SWRHA also noted that "additional courier services have been
implemented between the hospital and supporting laboratories for
faster receipt of laboratory test results."

[The travel history of this patient is not given, so one does not
know if the dengue virus infection was locally acquired or imported
from another locale. The report does not mention the abundance and
distribution of the _Aedes aegypti_ dengue virus vector in the area
where the case occurred. If the infection was locally acquired and
the vector mosquito is abundant, as seems likely, the probability of
ongoing transmission there is significant.

The 15 Jul 2010 edition of Prensa Latina (in Spanish
<http://www.prensa-latina.cu/index.php?option=3Dcom_content&task=3Dview&id=3D205989&Itemid=3D1>)
reported that Health authorities in Trinidad and Tobago are now on
alert to the rapid spread of dengue in the country, as 2 deaths from
DHF have been reported and 242 people have been hospitalized from the
disease. According to the Health Minister, Therese Baptiste-Cornelis,
the Caribbean nation accounts for more than 400 confirmed cases since
late June 2010, when frequent rains caused rivers to overflow and
flooding occurred in several locations.

This year [2010], 23 people have died of dengue fever in Honduras,
according to statistics released by the Honduran Health Ministry on
Monday [19 Jul 2010]. The number is nearly double last year's toll of
12. Health Minister Arturo Bendana said 22 000 [dengue virus]
infection cases were reported this year and 705 were the more
dangerous DHF (dengue hemorrhagic fever).

It was reported that regular meetings were held to study protection
measures and the financial ministry was asked by President Porfirio
Lobo to provide financial support for controlling the disease.

The number of dengue cases in Cebu City has risen dramatically in the
1st half of this year [2010] compared to last year [2009]. Statistics
from the Department of Health in Central Visayas showed that dengue
cases in city surged by 51 percent to 546 cases and 6 deaths from 1
Jan - 10 Jul this year [2010] from only 362 cases and 10 deaths in
the same period in 2009. Cebu City topped other cities in the entire
Central Visayas in the number of dengue cases and deaths.

A report by the Regional Epidemiology and Surveillance Unit (RESU) of
the DOH [Department of Health] in Central Visayas showed that a total
of 2461 dengue cases and 18 deaths were recorded between 1 Jan - 10
Jul 2010. This was 10 percent higher compared to the 2225 dengue
cases and 26 deaths the previous year. Most of the victims in the
region were children between 6 - 10 years old. About half or 53
percent of the victims were male. Majority of the dengue cases were
from Cebu City at 22.4 percent, followed by Talisay City with 5.4
percent, Tagbilaran City with 4.9 percent, Danao City with 4.26
percent and Lapu-Lapu City with 4.1 percent.

Dr. Jocelyn Abella, Dengue Prevention Coordinator for Central
Visayas, said the increase and decrease of dengue cases in certain
areas depend on the advocacy and health campaign of the local
government units against dengue.

Central Visayas reported a total of 7123 dengue cases for the whole
of 2009. The Integrated Provincial Health Office, however, presented
different statistics on the dengue cases in Cebu province.

The City Health Office here has declared a "very high alert level"
due to the soaring cases of dengue in the city. Dr. Rodel Agbulos,
city health officer, said a total of 1052 dengue cases have been
recorded in this city from January - June this year [2010], with 9
fatalities, which already surpassed the total number of cases, and
fatalities, registered in 2009. This compares with the 1029 cases,
with 8 fatalities, for the entire 2009, he said.

"For the 1st week of July alone, we have registered 71 cases and when
we talk about deaths, a total of 9 cases were fatal from January to
the 1st week of this month [July 2010]," Agbulos said of the dengue
cases. "We are declaring a very high alert level," he added,
stressing that the number of registered cases has not reached the
outbreak level as of yet. He called on every resident of the city "to
do your share of helping prevent the spread of the mosquito-borne
disease [virus]." He said cleanliness in the surroundings and
sanitation are the most effective and no-cost prescriptions to dengue
fever.

City Health Office records showed that there were 156 cases of dengue
in January, 158 in February, 149 in March, 93 in April, 123 in May,
302 in June and 71 for the 1st week alone of July this year [2010].
Agbulos said barangay Campo Islam, a slum village west of this city,
registered the most number of dengue fever cases since the 1st month
of this year.

Zamboanga City experienced an outbreak of dengue fever in 2007, when
cases of dengue soared to more than 3000 and Agbulos warned that if
nothing will be done, the present situation might reach the same
level as 3 years ago.

Around 45 community units in 14 sub districts in Yogyakarta have
become dengue fever endemic areas since 3 years ago. The number of
patients has increased as well. In 2009, there were 688 cases, with 5
dead people. Up until 19 Jul 2010, there have been 814 patients and
one dead person.

"Not one community unit in Yogyakarta is free from dengue fever
mosquitoes," said Rubangi, district surveillance officer of the
Yogyakarta Health Office, yesterday. However, this has not yet been
categorized as an extraordinary event.

About 20 dengue cases are reported a day within the Colombo Municipal
Council (CMC) limits, CMC Chief Medical Officer Dr. Pradeep
Kariywasam said. This does not include dengue victims taking private
and ayurveda treatment. Taking into account the unrecorded victims,
it seems more than one new dengue patient is found in the Colombo
City every hour.

The dengue death toll reported within the Colombo Municipal area so
far is 15 during this year [2010] while 1255 positive cases have been
identified, Dr. Kariyawasam said. According to the Epidemiological
Unit, there were 148 dengue deaths reported islandwide during this
year while 20 647 cases of dengue were detected. The CMC has launched
a vigorous campaign to combat dengue.

Dr. Kariyawasam said out of the 10 200 premises inspected during the
anti-dengue campaign launched by the CMC on Saturday, 1563 premises
had dengue mosquito breeding grounds. Only 642 households had
followed CMC guidelines to mitigate the dengue threat in their own
premises as well as the city, he added. "The householders'
cooperation to prevent mosquito borne diseases were at a very low
level and their attitude too was negative. They always question the
CMC about its incapability of clearing garbage collection within the
city but ignore their own responsibilities," he said. He said
Saturday's inspection campaign was only limited to the residences of
Colombo North and Colombo Central areas. The inspection especially
focused in the wards including Modera, Mattakkuliya, Kotahena,
Grandpass, Maligawatte, New Bazzar and Gintupitiya.

He said that about 300 CMC staffers, 200 from other organizations
including police officers, Rotary Club members and representatives
from other community organizations had been engaged in the
house-to-house visits. "The participation of over 1500 students is a
great support to us," he added. Most places identified as having a
dengue risk sites are uncleared gutters and drains neglected for a
long time by the occupants. Those places are neglected even after
deaths following dengue in their neighbour's houses, Dr. Kariyawasam
said.

A report by the Yemeni government today 13 Jul [2010] said that
dengue fever claimed 12 lives in Hadramout governorate and 1142
others were infected with the disease. Last week 7 children died of
the epidemic in Hajjah and 200 people are inflicted with the
epidemic, medical sources in Hajjah said.

More than 1100 cases were reported in Shabwa. Al-Jumhoori Hospital in
Taiz earlier reported 525 cases, but numbers are likely higher now.
Other governorates suffering from the outbreak include Aden, Abyan,
and Lahj.

A team of Saudi medical experts visited Hadramout in June and said
the lack of modern testing equipment complicates diagnostic efforts,
"A diagnostic machine that can trace the virus in the blood from the
1st day of infection is not available in Hadramout. Doctors depend on
the count of antibodies in the blood, which appear only after 7 days
from infection."

Doctors and residents in affected areas have complained about the
Health Ministry's lack of attention on the outbreak. In April [2010],
a hospital director in Taiz died from the disease, 2 months after the
outbreak was reported to the Health Ministry. The Health Ministry
made no efforts to prevent the spread of the disease in Taiz,
generating public protests which were broken up by police.

The district of Milhan has 100 000 residents and 16 medical
facilities that are woefully under equipped. Only 4 have generators,
one has microscopes and the rest lack electricity and a basic
laboratory.

Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne [virus] infection and education
campaigns should highlight the danger of stagnant water, open-liquid
containers and standing rainfall in areas where mosquitoes breed.
Yemen is suffering from severe water scarcity. Rural women can spend
up to 7 hours a day hauling water.
