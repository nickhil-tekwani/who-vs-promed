I fully agree with the concepts of Arthur, Rodney, Henri and Wlamir,
answering Phyllis' message.
Eduardo Fuenzalida developed a pre-exposure schedule for rabies
immunization (1) consisting in three doses of his vaccine (one every other
day) and yearly boosters. Since then, hundred of persons at risk in Latin
America have used it with excellent serological response and almost
negligible skin reactions. Most of these persons work actively in rabies
research of vampire and non-hematofagous bats, [some for more than 20
years (2-5).
Second generation vaccines are safer and more potent than F-P.
Unfortunately, prices preclude their use in developing countries where
hundreds of thousands' persons are vaccinated every year with SMB, after
exposure. The post-vaccinal reactions reported during the 60's with this
vaccine (6), mostly due to the use of mice older than three days, have
almost disappeared after its production technique was modified (7).
When comparing cross protection of F-P and PV-BHK vaccines against
challenge with rabies virus strains isolated from human, domestic animals
and wildlife (8), F-P protected mice against all but two strains. The
latter had had more than 20 mouse brain passages. PV-BHK, of higher potency
(3.7 IU), protected better than F-P (1.8 IU)
