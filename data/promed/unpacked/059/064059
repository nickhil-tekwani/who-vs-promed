Hepatitis C lookback in 2 trusts in southern England
----------------------------------------------------
This week 2 Trusts have written to 228 patients informing them that they
may be at risk of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. The patients had all
had an exposure prone procedure performed by a health care worker who is
infected with HCV. The infected health care worker was diagnosed during the
investigation of acute hepatitis C in a patient who had undergone an
exposure prone procedure. The hospitals have set up a telephone helpline.
Since 1994, 4 other patient notification exercises in the United Kingdom
(UK) have followed investigations of hospital acquired HCV infections in
patients in which hepatitis C infected health care workers have been
revealed (1-5). These exercises have documented a total of 13 transmissions
of HCV to patients during exposure prone procedures.
In 3 studies the prevalence of antibody to HCV among health care workers in
the UK has been shown to be less than 0.3% (6-8). Current guidance in the
UK is that HCV infected health care workers associated with transmission
should not perform exposure prone procedures (1). Following advice from the
Advisory Group on Hepatitis, the Department of Health has recently issued a
consultation document to the health professions on HCV infected health care
workers. The consultation document covers issues such as testing of health
care workers and restrictions on working practices. Clinical guidelines on
the management of hepatitis C were published recently by the Royal College
of Physicians of London and the British Society of Gastroenterology (9).

Consequences of nosocomial transmission of HCV in Surrey hospital
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Hospital chiefs in Harlow (Essex) are offering blood tests to more than 70
patients after a former member of staff was found to have contracted
hepatitis C. An investigation began in the autumn after the virus was
transmitted to a patient at Epsom General Hospital in Surrey. The infection
was traced to an individual who went on to work in the Women's Health
Department at Princess Alexandra Hospital (PAH) [in Harlow, Essex and has
since left. A search through 850 patient records at PAH covering the period
from autumn 2000 to early this year [showed that 67 mothers and 7 babies
may have been placed at risk. Those affected have now been informed by
letter and offered blood tests.
Mike Roddis, PAH's medical director, said yesterday: "We have computerised
records of people treated in the department and have been able to identify
everyone with any involvement. The risk of hepatitis C infection from an
infected health care worker to a patient during a surgical procedure is
very small," said Dr Roddis. "Any patients found to be hepatitis C positive
will be seen and offered treatment." Most people who become infected suffer
no ill effects [in the acute phase, but the virus may cause chronic liver
disease.
