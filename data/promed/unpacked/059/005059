A case of measles was confirmed in Michigan, and it's the 1st case in the state this year [2018].

According to health officials, a contagious person arrived at Detroit Metro Airport (DTW) on 6 Mar 2018. The person went to an urgent care center in Washtenaw County [Michigan].

The case stems from exposure during international travel.

"The individual returned from travel abroad 6 Mar 2018 at Detroit Metropolitan Airport, and was contagious upon returning to Michigan. Anyone who was in customs or baggage claim in the airport's north terminal between 2 and 5 p.m. that day should seek medical attention from their primary care provider if they develop symptoms of the disease," reads a statement from the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services [MDHHS].

MDHHS said the person was hospitalized and is recovering.

Measles is a viral infection that can result in pneumonia, brain inflammation or death. Signs of measles include a high fever, runny nose, cough and reddened, light-sensitive eyes, followed by a red, raised body rash that starts on the head and face and progresses to the rest of the body.

Measles is highly contagious and can be passed through the air by coughing and sneezing. Learn more about the measles from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The health department stresses the need to vaccinate to prevent measles: Because measles is easily spread, vaccination is the best protection against the disease. Successful prevention and control of measles requires high levels of immunity in all communities.

From 2001-2012, the average number of measles cases reported nationally per year was about 60. But in recent years there have been more, which is of great concern to public health authorities. In 2017, there were 118 cases in the U.S. including 2 cases in Michigan; the majority of people who got measles were not vaccinated.

The measles vaccine is highly effective and very safe. Adults who do not have evidence of immunity against measles should get at least one dose of the vaccine. The 1st of 2 routine childhood measles vaccine doses is given at 12 months of age. A 2nd vaccine dose is given before the start of kindergarten.

For international travel, infants as young as 6 months should be vaccinated against measles. Measles vaccine, or other acceptable documentation of immunity to measles, is recommended for all persons travelling internationally.

In an effort to help parents protect their children from serious vaccine-preventable diseases, MDHHS is participating in the I Vaccinate campaign. I Vaccinate provides the facts parents need to make informed decisions about vaccinations. For more information about immunizations and the I Vaccinate campaign, visit IVaccinate.org.

[Exposure to infected individuals in airports seems to be occurring more frequently (Also see post [2] below). This highlights the importance of MMR vaccination even in countries where measles is considered eradicated. The person who was carrying the disease traveled from India to Detroit, agency spokeswoman Lynn Sutfin told The Washington Post, but she declined to provide the gender of the person.

Health officials are warning passengers who made their way through Newark Airport that they may have been exposed to a highly contagious disease.

The New Jersey Department of Health says an international traveler with a confirmed case of measles arrived at Terminal C at Newark Airport on 2 Jan [2018], and departed for Indianapolis from a domestic terminal, officials say. The person may have gone to other areas of the airport.

Anyone who was at Newark Airport on that day between the hours of 6:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. may have been exposed to measles. If infected, symptoms could show up as late as 23 Jan [2018].

...

Anyone who believes they are infected is urged to go to the doctor or an emergency department.

New Jersey health departments are also working to notify passengers who were potentially exposed on the infected passenger's flight.

The Kansas Dept. of Health and Environment says the agency has received 6 additional cases of the infectious disease within days of learning of one at a Johnson Co. daycare. Five of the new reports come from Johnson Co., while the other one is just to the south, in Miami Co.

Some of the new cases reportedly appeared outside the daycare, and KDHE is worried people in the general population may have been exposed.

"Measles is spread through the air by breathing, coughing or sneezing," said KDHE Chief Health Officer, Dr. Greg Lakin. "It is so contagious that any person who is exposed to it, and is not immune, will likely contract the disease."

So far, KDHE says they and Johnson Co. have figured out where each individual was infected and are working to identify the contacts. They warn if someone has been to one of the listed locations, that person may have been exposed [see URL for locations of possible exposure].

On average, a person won't start showing symptoms for the measles for 10-14 days, and it may take up to 3 weeks before they do. If someone starts showing symptoms and plans to go see a healthcare provider, they are urged to call ahead so the facility can take measures to protect other patients and staff.

KDHE described measles as a respiratory disease. Initial symptoms typically are high fever, cough, runny nose, and red watery eyes. After about 3 to 5 days a rash begins to develop. It usually starts around the hairline and spreads down the neck, trunk, arms, and legs.

Health officials remind everyone the best way to protect themselves is to get the MMR vaccination.

http://arka.am/en/news/society/armenian_health_authorities_register_seven_cases_of_imported_measles/


Seven cases of imported measles were registered in Armenia in the 1st quarter of this year [2018], brought in all likelihood from Russia, Armenian Ministry of Health said today [14 Mar 2018].

It specified that 6 of the patients had not been vaccinated, and one had an incomplete vaccination. The ministry warned that measles outbreaks and resulting deaths have become a concern around the world. According to the WHO Office for the European Region, the epidemiological situation with measles is worsening across Europe. In 2017, the incidence of measles there was 3 times higher than in 2016. The most severe epidemiological situation is in Romania, Italy, Greece, Germany, Ukraine, Georgia and Russia.

According to the ministry, periodic incidence of imported measles, as well as the presence of people who have not been vaccinated or had it incompletely, may trigger a new outbreak of the disease in the country. The Ministry of Health called on all those who have not been vaccinated to visit their polyclinics to be vaccinated against measles.

It said the only safe and effective way to avoid measles is vaccination. Only a timely and complete (at least 2 doses) vaccination can prevent the occurrence of measles and its consequences.

The ministry also reported that since 1995, no cases of poliomyelitis have been registered in Armenia. In 2002 Armenia was proclaimed as a country free from poliomyelitis. It also said after an outbreak of diphtheria in 1994-1995, the situation stabilized, and since 2000, no cases of diphtheria have been recorded.

Measles is an acute infectious virus disease with a high level of susceptibility, characterized by high fever (up to 40.5 C [104-105 F]), inflammation of the mucous membranes of the oral cavity and upper respiratory tract, conjunctivitis, and characteristic patchy-papular rash of skin, and intoxication.

The misery of the people of Tharparkar continues after an outbreak of measles and malnutrition killed 5 children in the impoverished area of Sindh.

According to sources, the latest casualties that took place at Mithi Civil Hospital had taken the total number of infant deaths in Thar district to 123 this year [2018].

Talking to reporters, the parents of the deceased children said that measles and other infectious diseases had claimed the lives of their children. They alleged that the lackluster attitude of doctors and the absence of vital drugs were the main factors behind the deaths.

The district health officer (DHO) and the hospital's civil surgeon could not be reached for their comment on the issue, despite repeated attempts.

It is important to mention here that since last year 2017, the local health authorities in Thar have refused to share details of deaths with journalists after the Supreme Court (SC) took notice of the deaths of children in large numbers.

On the other hand, in an attempt to provide respite to the people of Thar, Sindh Chief Minister (CM) Syed Murad Ali Shah approved transportation of free wheat to the area, which would be distributed among 287 000 poverty-stricken families. Around 100 kilogrammes of wheat would be provided to each family.

The chief minister also directed the chief secretary to ensure that the wheat distribution was started immediately and completed by the end of April 2018.

Health and Nutrition Development Society (HANDS) Chief Executive Officer Dr Shaikh Tanweer Ahmed said that malnutrition was still the primary reason behind the continuing deaths among children. He said that the Sindh government should make efforts to fulfil the nutritional needs of pregnant women to slash the number of fatalities among infants and mothers in the area.

[The associated secondary infections that apparently complicate the primary measles in malnourished children might be responsible for higher mortality and could be due to socioeconomic and environmental causes that are associated with poverty and malnutrition rather than due to malnutrition or measles per se. Response of malnourished children to live attenuated measles vaccine has been found to be safe and effective. Neither malnutrition nor tuberculosis, which are widespread among malnourished children of developing countries, appear to be contraindications for measles vaccination. Thus, the beneficial effects of the measles vaccination should be fully exploited by adequate supply of potent vaccine and coverage of all susceptible children.

https://www.limerickleader.ie/news/health/302553/measles-cases-rises-to-23-as-outbreak-continues-to-worsen-in-limerick.html


The number of measles cases in Limerick has risen to 23, nearly 2 months after the virus outbreak was 1st announced. And it is understood that the HSE [Health Service Executive] is providing free MMR vaccination clinics, with no appointments required, on a number of dates. ...

The HSE has been urging people under 40 across the Mid-West to get the MMR vaccine as the problem worsens in Limerick. An Outbreak Control Team made up of representatives from the HSE is involved in managing the outbreak in an effort to prevent further spread.

The 1st confirmed cases were detected on 3 Jan [2018], and the outbreak was announced by the HSE on 31 Jan [2018]. "During this outbreak, MMR vaccine is free of charge to the public as the HSE is paying for the vaccine and for the GPs to give the vaccine.

"The following groups, in particular, should check if they have had 2 doses of MMR and if not, visit their GP to get immunised as soon as possible. If people do not have a medical record of their vaccination, it is not harmful to have extra doses to be on the safe side: Parents under the age of 40 who have never had measles or haven't had the full course of MMR vaccine; Adults under the age of 40 who work with the public; Couples under the age of 40 who may be planning a family; Adults and young people under the age of 40 who plan to travel abroad in the coming months."

The spokesperson said it was also important that parents of children in the region also check whether their children have had the vaccines appropriate for their age.

"Patients with symptoms of measles should avoid presenting to the emergency department where possible. If it is necessary to seek urgent care, it is important to inform the ambulance service or emergency department that you have symptoms consistent with measles beforehand so that the appropriate precautions can be taken.

"Similarly, if you have been in contact with a confirmed case of measles and are seeking medical attention, please inform the healthcare provider before attending.

"Measles is a serious public health issue. It is so contagious that if one person has it, 90% of the people close to that person who are not immune will also become infected. It is spread easily through coughing and sneezing. Measles can lead to serious complications such as pneumonia and inflammation of the brain and can, in rare cases, lead to a fatal disease of the brain, which develops years after the infection."

https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/health/ten-people-now-been-struck-14410656


Ten people have now been struck down with measles in south Wales following an outbreak, it has been confirmed.

Public Health Wales says most of the people affected are teenagers or young adults living in Cardiff, Newport and Blaenau Gwent, and it has now spread to the Vale of Glamorgan too.

The trust is now urging others to get 2 doses of the MMR vaccine as soon as possible to prevent it spreading further.

A spokesman for Public Health Wales said: "Investigations suggest that the 1st few cases in the outbreak were exposed to an unknown and highly infectious case in Cardiff city centre in early February 2018, and there has been onward transmission through secondary infections into the wider area."

Public Health Wales says it is working with health boards and councils to contact those exposed to measles cases and arranging vaccinations. ...

Anyone affected is being told they should not go to places of work, study or school, and to avoid social interactions.

Dr Gwen Lowe, consultant in communicable disease control for Public Health Wales, said: "Measles is highly infectious and the only way to prevent large outbreaks is through vaccination.

"We are expecting to see more measles cases in the coming weeks as a result of onward spread from the 1st group of cases. These are all linked by being in the same area in Cardiff city centre on the same day in early February 2018.

"It is likely that there were other people exposed who also subsequently developed infectious measles and did not seek healthcare support. We have not identified the original source for the infection.

"At that time, we had no known measles cases in Wales, but it is worth noting that there are significant measles outbreaks elsewhere in the UK and in other countries in Europe.

"In this particular outbreak most of the cases have been in teenagers and young adults. Health staff are, therefore, concentrating on identifying the settings in which these cases have been whilst infectious and making sure that their vaccination efforts are targeted towards these settings and other close contacts in the 1st instance.

"But as measles is currently circulating, we would also urge all parents whose children have not received 2 doses of MMR to speak to their GP immediately and arrange for this quick, safe and effective vaccine to be given. So too should older adults who have never had measles or the MMR vaccine and work in close contact with children."

The 1st dose of MMR is usually given to babies at 12 months old and the 2nd at 3 years and 4 months of age, but it is never too late to catch up on missed doses.

The MMR vaccine is recommended by the World Health Organisation, UK Department of Health, and Public Health Wales as the most effective and safe way to protect children against measles.

About 1 in 5 children with measles can experience serious complications such as ear infections, pneumonia or meningitis. One in 10 children with measles ends up in hospital and in rare cases it can be fatal.

A further 2 people have died in Serbia from measles-related complications, taking the death toll since the start of the epidemic last October 2017 to 13. In total, the Serbian health authorities have registered 3650 cases of measles.

In over 95% of cases, the infected persons were not vaccinated or were only partly vaccinated, the authorities said, renewing their call for vaccinations. However, experts say the epidemic has peaked and that the number of contagions should now gradually decline.

Two unvaccinated minors with measles, admitted last February 2018 in the hospital of Manises, are the focus of the outbreak of the infectious disease [measles] that has been registered in the hospital center and that already affects 11 people, although the figure could increase to 16.

This was confirmed yesterday [16 Mar 2018] by sources of the Ministry of Health and the management of the hospital, which emphasized that "all preventive and control measures" dictated by the General Directorate of Public Health that intervened before the outbreak the past Fri 9 Mar 2018 had been done.

On that day, 9 Mar 2018, the infection of an employee who went to the ER on Thu [8 Mar 2018] with symptoms had been confirmed. Another worker had been discharged from the hospital (on Wed [7 Mar 2018]), and a 3rd employee had also come to the emergency room with the same symptoms, for which he was admitted.

There had been talk of 9 infected in the outbreak (4 workers and 5 neighbors), but the truth is that there are already 11 people affected, and 5 other cases are "under study," according to official health sources. ...-more

http://portugalresident.com/new-measles-outbreak-identifies-32-cases-in-porto-hospital-almost-all-of-them-staff


Porto's Santo António hospital is on measles alert after 7 confirmed cases and 25 "possibles," people who may have contracted the highly-contagious disease, almost all of them members of staff.

Pressing the message home that anyone who has not been fully vaccinated could be at risk, general director of health Graça Freitas has suggested that the outbreak started with the arrival at the hospital of a 27-year-old man who contracted the disease in France. The man was not vaccinated against measles, she said.

He went on to infect a 43-year-old man and 5 other hospital professionals, 3 of which are now interned and one of whom is described as in an "unstable condition."

Graça Freitas has not explained whether all the victims are people who were not vaccinated.

For now, there has been no registration of any inpatients with symptoms, reported the tabloid Correio da Manhã, and authorities appeal to anyone who suspects they may have measles to telephone their family doctor.

The bottom line message is that no one with symptoms that could be measles should go to emergency departments or health centres, as this will only help the outbreak spread even further.

Measles has been creeping back in Europe due to so many people balking at taking the MMR triple vaccine. Despite authorities' insistence that the vaccine is safe, thousands of parents have been refusing to vaccinate their children for years, leading to a situation where there is no longer "herd immunity" in many countries.

Measles hit the headlines in Portugal almost exactly a year ago, when 17-year-old IS died from complications of the disease. The teen was the country's 1st measles-related death in decades.

For the 2nd time this month [March 2018], Peru health officials report a confirmed measles case in the country. The National Center for Epidemiology, Prevention and Control of Diseases of the Ministry of Health (Minsa) says the case is a 16-year-old adolescent living in the city of Juliaca, Puno.

Health Minister Dr. Abel Salinas Rivas said that the child would have been infected because he travels constantly to various areas of the Altiplano.

The 1st confirmed case of measles since 2000 was detected on 2 Mar of this year [2018] in a 46-year-old man who lives in Callao and traveled to Puno between 5 and 14 Feb 2018. At the moment, epidemiological control actions have been activated in parallel in Callao and Puno.

Health officials located the people who had contact with the adolescent in the last days, including the health personnel who treated him at the Carlos Monge Medrano Hospital in Juliaca; all are symptom free.

Rivas noted that all epidemiological alerts are still active in health facilities in that region.

The Ministry of Health (Ssa), identified at least 3 cases of measles in Mexico City, while the 4th was reported in Baja California, indicated local sources.

According to the National System of Epidemiological Surveillance (Sinave), which belongs to the Ssa, one of the cases reported in the capital is that of a 39-year-old Italian woman who has been living in Mexico City for a little more than a decade.

The Sinave reported that the woman presented symptoms of infection such as fever, maculopapular rash (rashes that do not rise above the surface of the skin), cough and swelling of the mucosa of the nose.

The 2nd case corresponds to a 1-year-old child who had not been vaccinated. The child is the son of the Italian woman and had not yet received the vaccine that protects him from the disease due to his young age.

The Ministry of Health ruled out an epidemic of measles.

On the other hand, a woman of 48 years, who works caring for the child, was the 3rd case reported in the Mexican capital, while the 4th case, reported in Baja California, is that of a person who had left on a trip recently.

Pablo Kuri Morales, undersecretary of Prevention and Health Promotion of the Ssa, reported that the Italian woman could have contracted the disease because in her place of work, the Italian Embassy in Mexico, she could have come in contact with an infected person. Kuri Morales indicated that in Italy, there was an outbreak of measles, so it was likely that a visitor to the embassy carried the virus that causes the infection.

The undersecretary also indicated that in Mexico the disease is controlled and that the virus does not circulate in the country, so the 4 confirmed cases are not part of an epidemic.

When the 3 cases of the City in Mexico were reported, personnel of the Ssa initiated an epidemiological fence in the Benito Juárez, Tlalpan and Coyoacán delegations to detect other outbreaks of the disease, which have not presented.

Being a highly contagious disease, the virus that spreads it can be transmitted from one person to another when coming into contact with secretions coming from the nose, mouth or throat of the infected patient.

According to the Ssa, the last autochthonous case of measles was recorded 23 years ago.

Between 1997 and 2017, only 176 cases of measles have been registered, all, according to Kuri Morales, imported or associated with imports, as in the case of the Italian citizen and the inhabitant of Baja California.

https://g1.globo.com/rr/roraima/noticia/onze-novos-casos-suspeitos-de-sarampo-sao-registrados-em-48h-em-roraima.ghtml


The number of reported cases of measles in Roraima has reached 50 since the 1st case, on 13 Feb 2018, was identified in Boa Vista. Only on this weekend, during Sat 10 Mar and Sun 11 Mar 2018, 11 new suspected cases were registered. So far, 14 patients have had the confirmed diagnosis of the disease in every state, and 36 remain under investigation.

The updated data were released on Mon 14 Mar 2018 by the State Department of Health (Sesau). All confirmed cases were recorded in Venezuelans ranging in age from 7 months-18 years.

The general coordinator of Health Surveillance, Daniela Souza, explained that all 11 new suspects were admitted with symptoms of measles in health units.

Of these, 7 were recorded in Warao Indians in the municipality of Pacaraima, a city bordering Venezuela. These were the earliest records of the disease outside the capital.

Most of the patients are people who have recently arrived from Venezuela, according to the coordinator general. The age range of notified patients varies from 3-month-old infants to 33-year-old adults.

On Saturday [10 Mar 2018], the 'Dia [Day] D' vaccination against measles was carried out in Roraima . Two days after the campaign, Sesau said he had not yet counted how many people had been immunized throughout the state.

According to the municipality of Boa Vista, 20 431 people were reached in the municipality, of which 9693 were already vaccinated. Only 10 601 who did not have the vaccine received the dose.

The vaccination campaign was brought forward across the state to prevent an outbreak of the disease. The expectation is that by 10 Apr 2018, 420 000 Venezuelans and Brazilians will be immunized.

Since 2015, Roraima has received an increasing influx of Venezuelan immigrants. The city of Boa Vista estimates that they already have 40 000 living in the capital. Many come to the state in search of food and work, but others are also in need of medical care.

The 1st suspected case of measles was recorded in a Venezuelan immigrant baby on 13 Feb 2018. The patient lived with her family in a square in the center of Boa Vista.

An analysis made by the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (Fiocruz) has confirmed that the virus circulating in the state originated in Venezuela. Before the campaign, about 2000 immigrants had already been immunized in the streets, squares and shelters of the state.

In 2017, 4 countries in the Region of the Americas reported confirmed cases of measles: Argentina (3 cases), Canada (45 cases), the United States of America (120 cases), and the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (727 cases). In the 1st 3 months of 2018, a total of 9 countries have reported confirmed cases: Antigua and Barbuda (1 case), Brazil (14 cases), Canada (4 cases), Colombia (1), the United States of America (13 cases), Guatemala (1 case), Mexico (4 cases), Peru (2 cases), and Venezuela (159 cases). Figure 1 [see URL].

Following is a summary of the situation by the countries reporting measles cases in 2018.

The reported cases in Antigua and Barbuda and in Guatemala are both imported cases, from the United Kingdom and Germany, respectively.

The full report is available in the PAHO/WHO 6 Feb 2018 Epidemiological Update on measles.

In Brazil, there is an ongoing measles outbreak with cases reported in the municipalities of Boa Vista and Pacaraima, Roraima state. Since the detection of the 1st case in epidemiological week (EW) 8 of 2018 up to 12 Mar 2018, 50 suspected measles cases (43 in Boa Vista municipality and 7 in Pacaraima municipality) have been reported. Of these, 14 were laboratory confirmed by serological and molecular tests, and 36 remain under investigation (including one fatal case) (Figure 2).

All of the confirmed cases are unvaccinated, Venezuelan citizens, with ages ranging between 9-months to 18-years-old; 10 are male.

According to the laboratory analysis conducted by the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (Fiocruz/RJ), the genotype identified in all of the laboratory confirmed cases is D8. This genotype is identical to the one identified in Venezuela in 2017.

The actions implemented include: Measles vaccination campaign in 15 municipalities of Roraima state targeting persons from 6 months of age to 49 years old and immigrants from Venezuela; Intensified epidemiological surveillance through active and retrospective institutional case finding, contact tracing, and monitoring of contacts; Strengthening of laboratory networks; Risk communication.

In Colombia, in EW 11 of 2018, a case of measles was reported in a 14-month-old male child, Venezuelan national from the city of Caracas, Venezuela, who remains hospitalized. The case was reported by the municipality of Medellín, Antioquia Department. The child arrived in Colombia on 2 Mar 2018, and onset of rash was 8 Mar 2018. The National Institute of Health reported the detection of IgM antibodies for measles in serum sample and for detection of virus by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from a pharyngeal swab on 14 Mar 2018.

The actions implemented include: Detection and follow up of contacts (all are asymptomatic to date); Active case finding in institutions and in the community; Vaccination of susceptible persons.

In Mexico, between EW 1 and 10 of 2018, 4 measles cases were reported, all imported or associated with importation.

The 1st case was reported in EW 7, in a 38-year-old female resident of Tijuana, Baja California who was a contact of a confirmed measles case identified on an international flight. The case was confirmed by the Institute of Epidemiological Diagnosis and Reference (InDRE, per its acronym in Spanish) through real time RT-PCR molecular testing; phylogenetic analysis identified genotype B3.

Three additional cases of measles were confirmed in Mexico City with onsets of rash between EW 7 and EW 10 of 2018. These cases are linked and are in a 39-year-old female, her nearly 1-year-old son, and a 48-year-old female caretaker of the child.

Regarding the vaccination history of the 4 confirmed cases, one of the cases was vaccinated; one was not vaccinated (under one year old); and 2 had unknown vaccination histories.

In EW 10, a probable measles case was detected in a 4-year-old foreigner who visited the city of Guasave, Sinaloa State; the case has already returned to their country of residence. Onset of rash was 28 Feb 2018. The serological test conducted by InDRE resulted in positive serology for measles. The case's country of residence has been informed, and final classification is pending. ...-more

The Pan American Health Organization/World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) is urging countries to vaccinate against measles to maintain its elimination in the Americas.

Measles was declared eliminated from the Americas in 2016, following the declaration of rubella and CRS [congenital rubella syndrome] elimination in 2015.

The region was the 1st in the world to have eliminated all 3 diseases, culminating a 22-year effort involving mass vaccination against measles, mumps, and rubella throughout the Americas.

However, the highly contagious nature of the measles virus and the fact that both it and the rubella virus continue to circulate in the rest of the world mean that the region is at risk of outbreaks.

In the 1st months of 2018, there were [8] countries in the region reporting confirmed cases: Antigua and Barbuda (1 case), Brazil (14 cases), Canada (4 cases), Guatemala (1 case), Mexico (4 cases), Peru (2 cases), the United States (13 cases), and Venezuela (886 cases in total, 159 cases in 2018), according to the epidemiological update.

In light of this situation, PAHO/WHO has recommended the following to its countries:
- Vaccinate to maintain 95% homogeneous coverage with the 1st and 2nd doses of the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine in all municipalities.
- Strengthen epidemiological surveillance in public and private health services to detect suspected cases.
- Respond quickly when an imported measles case is detected in order to prevent the reestablishment of endemic transmission of the virus; this includes activating teams to follow up on patients with measles and their contacts.
- Maintain a reserve of measles-rubella (MR) vaccines in each country of the region for imported case control actions.

[The common theme running through all these measles outbreaks is lack of immunization with the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine. This well tested and safe vaccine is the best approach to protection. Unfortunately, the anti-vaccination push remains stronger than ever. - Mod.LK]
