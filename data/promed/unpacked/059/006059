A total of 11 881 dengue fever cases have been reported in the country [Thailand] since the beginning of the year [2014], Thai News Agency (TNA) reported.

Public health permanent secretary Dr Narong Sahametapat said that of the total [11 881 cases], 13 people aged between 15 and 24 [years old] have died from dengue fever from [1 Jan 2014 to 8 Jul 2014]. However, the number of patients reported so far this year [2014] was 80 per cent lower than in the same period in 2013.

Public health officials throughout the country have been warned to remain on high alert against the spread of dengue, especially during the current rainy season. Hospitals, schools and households have been advised to get rid of mosquito larvae to prevent the outbreak of the disease.

[According to the World Health Organization (WHO), "dengue fever is an acute febrile disease transmitted by the bite of an _Aedes_ mosquito infected with any one of the 4 dengue viruses. Dengue fever, with its severe manifestations dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS), has emerged as a great public health concern, spreading to all tropical and sub-tropical countries in the world. An estimated 2.5 billion people in more than 100 countries are at risk, and an estimated 50 million dengue infections occur annually in the world. It is of particular importance in South East Asia, which bear high burden of dengue" (http://www.searo.who.int/entity/vector_borne_tropical_diseases/topics/dengue/en/).

Severe dengue is a potentially lethal complication, affecting both children and adults, and early clinical diagnosis and careful clinical management by experienced physicians and nurses increase survival of patients.

Strengthening primary health care and health promotion and greater community and education involvement in source reduction appear to be effective dengue control measures (http://www2.wpro.who.int/rcm/en/archives/rc59/rc_resolutions/WPR_RC59_R6.htm).

Thailand and Cambodia share a similar pattern of cumulative dengue trend since the beginning of 2014 if compared with 2013, but the latest available dengue situation update in the Western Pacific Region, as of 3 Jun 2014, indicates an increased recent trend in Cambodia, Lao PDR, Malaysia, and Singapore for the reporting period of May 2014 which is the beginning of the rainy season in the region (see http://www.wpro.who.int/emerging_diseases/Dengue.Biweekly.03Jun2014.pdf?ua=1).

According to the most recent surveillance data available on the Thai Ministry of Public Health, Bureau of Epidemiology website, as of 6 Jul 2014, there have been a total of 11 881 cases reported from 77 provinces (reported incidence 18.7 per 100 000 population), including 13 deaths (reported mortality rate of 0.2 per 100 000 population). The most affected age group were the 15-24 year olds, representing 24.6 per cent, followed by the 10-14 year olds (19.7 per cent) and the 25-34 year olds (12.4 per cent).

Nationalities of the cases: Thai (98.0 per cent), Burmese (1.0 per cent), other (0.4 per cent), Cambodia (0.3 per cent), Lao (0.1 per cent), Chinese (0.1 per cent), Vietnamese, and Malaysian (less than 0.1 per cent each).

The provinces most affected with the highest reported incidence rates per 100 000 population were: Krabi (88.4), Phuket (75.6), Nan (62.5), Pattalung (58.3), and Maehongsorn (53.3).

The highest reported incident rates (per 100 000 population) by regions were the south (38.6), followed by central (22.0), the north (16.5) and the northeast (8.5) (see http://www.boe.moph.go.th/boedb/surdata/506wk/y57/en/d262766_2657_en.pdf for the full report).
