FOOT AND MOUTH DISEASE IN BOTSWANA: Suspected outbreaks (follow-up report
No. 1)

See also: 10 Jan 2003, 24 May 2002, 12 Apr 2002, 22 Mar 2002, 8 Mar 2002,
15 Feb 2002

Information received on 15 Jan 2003 from Dr Micus Chiwasanee Chimbombi,
Director of Animal Health and Production, Ministry of Agriculture, Gaborone:

End of previous report period: 7 Jan 2003 (see Disease Information, 16 [2],
11, dated 10 Jan 2003).

End of this report period: 15 Jan 2003.

New suspected outbreaks:
Location: Tsiteng crush, Matsiloje extension area
No. of outbreaks 1
Location: Strauss farm (21 deg 10 min 25.6 sec S - 27 deg 33 min 41.9 sec E)
No. of outbreaks 1

Description of affected population in the suspected outbreaks: a wild kudu
(_Tragelaphus strepsiceros_), and bovine animals of various age groups
residing in kraals falling within two neighbouring crush areas
(epidemiological units) called Matopi and Tsiteng in the Matsiloje
extension area.

The initial cases (9) were recorded at Matopi crush (see Emergency Report).
Since then, through an extensive mouthing survey in a targeted 25 km x 30
km area (infected zone), 14 more cases in the same crush and another 2 in
the neighbouring Tsiteng crush have been found, bringing the total number
of bovine cases to 25.

A wild kudu in the neighbouring crush (Strauss farm) was found by a
surveillance team to be lame and emaciated. It was killed, clinically
examined for FMD, and found to have lesions highly suggestive of FMD, and
subsequently destroyed. Inspection of almost all the cattle in this farm
has yielded negative results.

An extensive foot and mouth disease (FMD) survey on wildlife, dictated by
species' homing range, is under way to determine the extent of the disease
in wildlife.

Total number of animals in the suspected outbreaks (updated data):

Outbreaks / species / susceptible / cases / deaths / destroyed / slaughtered
Matopi crush / bov / 700 / 23 / 0 / 400/ 0
Tsiteng crush / bov / 800 / 2/ 0 / 0 / 0
Strauss farm / fau* / - / 1 / 0 / 1 / 0
* greater kudu (_Tragelaphus strepsiceros_).

Diagnosis: the disease has yet to be confirmed. However, the clinical
presentation and preliminary results are highly indicative of a
SAT-virus-related outbreak.

A. Laboratories where diagnosis is being carried out: OIE Reference
Laboratories for foot and mouth disease in Botswana(1) and the United
Kingdom(2).

B. Causal agent:
- In cattle: SAT 1 or 2 suspected from preliminary ELISA screening test
results.
- In kudu: SAT 1 suspected from preliminary ELISA screening test results.

Epidemiology:
A. Source of agent / origin of infection: unknown.

B. Mode of spread: suspected to be contact with infected animals or
material. Matopi and Tsiteng crushes are only 8 km apart and indeed cattle
in these 2 crushes routinely mix and share common grazing and water points.
Domestic cloven-hoofed animals in other crushpens did not show any FMD-like
lesions, indicating that possibly the disease in domestic cloven-hoofed
species is confined to Matopi and Tsiteng crushes.

C. Other epidemiological details: if the disease is confirmed in kudu
samples, this may provide a vital clue to the epidemiology of the disease
in the Matsiloje extension area, which had its first outbreak in 2 decades
the same time last year (3) at Lephaneng and Rakop 1 crushes. The last
outbreak's infected zone remains destocked following last year's
eradication exercise and it forms a cattle-free surveillance zone in this
outbreak.

Control measures during reporting period:
a. Area demarcation:
- The infected area has been determined; it is physically delineated by
fenced freehold farms to the north, west, south, and the veterinary cordon
fence along the border with Zimbabwe to the east. It has an estimated
cattle population of 5000.
- The adjacent area is the surveillance zone, where all animals are being
mouthed and serologically sampled for FMD. It has an estimated cattle
population of 40 000. Both zones have been blockaded by Departmental staff,
Botswana Defence Force and Botswana Police.

b. Biosecurity: All people and vehicles leaving the infected area and the
entire Veterinary Disease Control Zones Nos. 6 and 7 are thoroughly
dipped/sprayed with 4 percent sodium carbonate or virucidal disinfectant.
Veterinary officials working in the area observe appropriate biosecurity
measures.

c. Quarantine and movement restriction: Countrywide cloven-hoofed animal
movement was banned and all abattoirs (export and non-export abattoirs)
closed indefinitely whilst nationwide visual inspection of cloven-hoofed
domestic animals was being conducted. The nationwide inspection has shown
that the disease has not spread beyond the control zone, and as such a new
movement protocol has been issued relaxing movement restrictions in the
rest the country to a limited extent whilst still restricting movement in
the affected district and those districts adjacent to it.

d. Stamping out: Mass destruction of cattle at crushes where the disease
has been detected clinically started on 14 Jan 2003; so far 400 cattle have
been destroyed at a destruction site where Matopi and Tsiteng cattle were
being destroyed. Animals are being buried in pits lined with sodium
carbonate. Destruction is on-going.

e. Vaccination: All animals in the infected area where clinical cases have
not been found are being vaccinated with a locally produced trivalent (SAT
1, 2, 3) vaccine to limit disease spread. Vaccinated animals are identified
with brand "I". To date, about 450 of the expected 1500 cattle have been
vaccinated. Cattle in crushes where clinical cases have been detected are
being destroyed.

f. Surveillance:
In cattle: Clinical surveillance is being conducted in the immediate
surveillance zone; so far about 14 000 of the estimated 40 000 cattle have
been inspected (including serological sampling of the 2350 cattle in the
area of highest risk). No FMD lesions have been detected in the
surveillance zone so far.

In small stock: Historically, these have played a relatively less
significant role in the epidemiology of FMD in this country. To minimise
chances of inspection teams infecting small stock, their detailed
inspection will be done after the disease in cattle has been contained.

In pigs: Given their ability to contract and transmit the disease easily,
all the pigs (approximately 70 pigs in 1 farm) in the infected zone will be
destroyed as soon as possible as a precautionary measure.

In wildlife: Extensive wildlife surveillance is scheduled to start soon.

[An excellent update on the nature and progress of the current control
program. Transparency like this should be appreciated by all and will
certainly provide important additional information to decision makers. -
