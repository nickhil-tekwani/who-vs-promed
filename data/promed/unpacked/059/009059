Health officials say four people in the Brushy Creek neighborhood northwest
of Austin have tested positive for cryptosporidiosis following a
170,000-gallon sewage spill. Authorities in Williamson County say more than
100 residents have reported symptoms since raw sewage spilled into the
water supply two weeks ago.
The contamination occurred July 14 following a power outage at a city of
Austin pumping station. Area residents continued to drink the water for
more than a week before the contamination was discovered. Water officials
have closed 13 wells.
Officials said more than 100 people have called to report symptoms, and the
organism has been positively identified in four residents. Health officials
are urging area residents to see their doctor for treatment and testing for
the disease.
About 10,000 people live in the Brushy Creek neighborhood west of Round Rock.
