[I started compiling this report on [Wed 16 May 2018] and have been awaiting more information which unfortunately has not been available. The website appears to be undergoing revision and information is now only available through [Fri 23 Feb 2018] on the below link. Hopefully the absence of new reports reflects a true absence of significant MERS-CoV activity in Saudi Arabia.

(Not all of the links have the .../en/CCC.... as some are links to the Arabic language pages). The URL links provided here are the actual Url links where the information came from. With the redesign of the website underway, they are currently inactive links. I presume that once the design is complete and the web archives are re-populated, these links will return to full functionality. - Mod.MPP]

There have been a total of:
1832 newly confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection, including
741 reported fatalities [reported case fatality rate of 40.4 per cent]
1081 recoveries, and
9 currently active cases [those who have not been reflected in reports of fatalities or recoveries]

Since the last update (through 17 Apr 2018) there have been:
5 newly confirmed cases
3 newly reported fatalities
5 newly reported recoveries

[Note that during this period 18 Apr 2018 - 16 May 2018 there were no reports on the Saudi MERS English website for 19, 23, 24, 29 and 30 Apr 2018 and 8,9,10 May 2018. Fortunately information was available on the Saudi MERS Arabic website for 19, 23, 24 and 30, and was translated by Mod.GMM. Also, note that exposure histories refer to the 14 days preceding onset of illness. - Mod.MPP]

[Perhaps the good news is that MERS-CoV transmission in Saudi Arabia, in the absence of nosocomial outbreaks, has been maintaining a low level endemic transmission pattern, with a slowdown in the identifying of new cases so that there is now time for the MOH to revise the website pages dealing with MERS-CoV reporting.

In the one-month period from mid-April 2018 to mid-May 2018, there were a total of 5 newly confirmed cases of MERS-CoV associated disease reported by Saudi Arabia. These 5 newly confirmed cases came from 4 different regions: Ash Sharqiyah - Eastern (2 cases), Makkah, Al Jawf, and Tab큰k. One of these cases was reported to have died, and another was reported to have recovered.

Maps showing the geographic locations of these newly reported cases can be found at the source URLs. The HealthMap/ProMED map of Saudi Arabia can be found at: http://healthmap/promed/p/131. - Mod.MPP]

MERS situation update, April 2018
---------------------------------
Highlights, April 2018
- At the end of April 2018, a total of 2206 laboratory-confirmed cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), including 787 associated deaths (case-fatality rate: 35.7 percent) were reported globally; the majority of these cases were reported from Saudi Arabia (1831 cases, including 713 related deaths with a case-fatality rate of 39 percent).
- During the month of April [2018], a total of 7 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS were reported in Saudi Arabia including 2 associated deaths (case-fatality rate: 28.6 percent). No healthcare associated transmission or hospital outbreak was reported during this month.
- The demographic and epidemiological characteristics of cases do not show any significant difference when compared to cases reported during the same corresponding period of 2013 to 2018. Owing to improved infection prevention and control practices in hospitals, the number of hospital-acquired cases of MERS has dropped significantly since 2015.
- The age group 50-59 years continues to be at the highest risk for acquiring infection as primary cases. The age group 30-39 years is most at risk for secondary cases. The number of deaths is higher in the age group 50-59 years for primary cases and 70-79 years for secondary cases.

[According to the WHO MERS-CoV global data, as of the end of April 2018 there have been a total of 2206 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection reported worldwide, including 787 associated deaths (reported case-fatality rate: 35.7 percent). There is mention of 7 newly confirmed cases during the month of April 2018 whereas my spreadsheet from this period reflects a total of 9 newly confirmed cases during the month of April 2018. Of the 9 newly confirmed cases there were 3 reported deaths (reported case fatality rate of 33.3 percent), 3 reported recoveries (33.3 percent) and 3 cases with outcome information still pending.

It is interesting to see the situation update tables, comparing case characteristics annually. As the 1st confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection occurred during April 2012, we have now completed 6 years of experience observing MERS-CoV activity. Unfortunately the reported case fatality rate remains above 30 percent (see part [3] below for a discussion on a clinical trial using targeted monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of MERS-CoV infection), and a significant proportion of cases while classified as primary infections, the actual high risk exposure has not been clearly defined as yet. - Mod.MPP]

[3] Research - Monoclonal Antibody treatment trial - NIAID

Experimental MERS treatments enter clinical trial
NIH-sponsored trial to test 2 human monoclonal antibodies.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Enrollment has begun in an early-stage clinical trial testing the safety of 2 human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) designed to treat people infected with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). The trial is sponsored by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health, and is funded in part by the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, part of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, Department Health and Human Services.

The 1st recognized case of MERS was reported in Jordan in 2012. Since then, MERS-CoV has spread to 27 countries. As of [1] May [2018], 2206 laboratory-confirmed cases have been reported to the World Health Organization. Those cases include 787 deaths, a fatality rate of about 36 percent.

"Currently, we lack specific treatments for MERS," said NIAID Director Anthony S. Fauci, M.D. "Having targeted therapeutics available to treat this unpredictable and frequently fatal respiratory disease would help us reduce MERS-associated deaths and control future outbreaks."

The mAbs, REGN3048 and REGN3051, were discovered and developed by scientists at the biotechnology company Regeneron, headquartered in Tarrytown, New York. Subsequently, researchers at Regeneron and the University of Maryland School of Medicine demonstrated the ability of the antibodies to neutralize MERS-CoV in a mouse model of MERS. The new NIAID trial is the 1st to test these mAbs in people.

The study will enroll 48 healthy adults between the ages of 18 and 45 years at WCCT Global, a clinic in Cypress, California. Participants will be divided into 6 groups of 8, with 2 people in each group receiving an inactive placebo and the remaining 6 receiving both experimental mAbs delivered intravenously. The study is blinded, meaning neither the study staff nor the participants will know whether a placebo or the mAb is being administered. Participants in the initial cohort will receive the lowest dosage of the experimental antibodies, 1.5 milligrams (mgs) of each mAb per kilogram (kg) of the volunteer's weight. Participants in successive cohorts will receive increasing dosages until the highest dosage (75 mg/kg of each mAb) is reached in the 6th group.

Decisions to continue the trial and to administer the escalating doses of mAbs will be made by an independent safety review committee (SRC) whose members will have access to safety and tolerability data throughout the trial. The SRC will meet at regularly scheduled intervals to determine if any pre-established criteria have been met that would require the trial to be halted. If there are no safety concerns, the trial will proceed to enroll participants into the next higher dosage cohort. The study is expected to be completed by June 2019.

Additional information about the trial is available at https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/home, using the identifier NCT03301090. The trial is funded through contract HHSN272201500005I.

[We usually do not report on early clinical trials as there are many promising new vaccines drugs and treatment modalities that unfortunately fail in the early stages of safety and efficacy/outcome. The ever growing field of use of targeted monoclonal antibodies for both preventive as well as curative modalities for viral diseases warrants mention in this thread on MERS-CoV. Given the high reported case fatality rate there is a need for effective treatment modalities to address this disease (note my use of "reported", suggesting that the true case fatality rate may well be significantly lower as milder cases most likely do not come to the attention of the formal health sector and most likely have self-limited disease events.). In the 3 references mentioned below, the authors provide excellent discussions on the state of the art of developing and using targeted monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of viral diseases such as MERS-CoV associated disease.

In ref 2, a 2006 publication by the Protein Interaction Group of NIH, the authors summarize in their abstract:
"Polyclonal antibodies have a century-old history of being effective against some viruses; recently, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have also shown success. The humanized mAb Synagis (palivizumab), which is still the only mAb against a viral disease approved by the US FDA, has been widely used as a prophylactic measure against respiratory syncytial virus infections in neonates and immunocompromised individuals. The 1st fully human mAbs against 2 other paramyxoviruses, Hendra and Nipah virus, which can cause high (up to 75 percent) mortality, were recently developed; one of them, m101, showed exceptional potency against infectious virus. In an amazing pace of research, several potent human mAbs targeting the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus S glycoprotein that can affect infections in animal models have been developed months after the virus was identified in 2003. A potent humanized mAb with therapeutic potential was recently developed against the West Nile virus. The progress in developing neutralizing human mAbs against Ebola, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, vaccinia and other emerging and biodefense-related viruses is slow. A major problem in the development of effective therapeutic agents against viruses, including therapeutic antibodies, is the viruses' heterogeneity and mutability. A related problem is the low binding affinity of cross reactive antibodies able to neutralize a variety of primary isolates. Combinations of mAbs or mAbs with other drugs, and/or the identification of potent new mAbs and their derivatives that target highly conserved viral structures, which are critical for virus entry into cells, are some of the possible solutions to these problems, and will continue to be a major focus of antiviral research."

We await results of the proposed clinical trial.
