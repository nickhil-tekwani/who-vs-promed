An Indonesian woman died of suspected bird flu in a village that has
been hard hit by the disease, a hospital official said on Friday [18
Aug 2006], as health workers investigated a new possible cluster of
the H5N1 virus. The woman died on Thursday night 3 hours after being
admitted to Dr. Slamet Hospital in West Java province with symptoms
of bird flu, said Yati Maryati, the hospital's director, who was
awaiting laboratory test results to see if she had contracted the virus.
The woman was from Cikelet, a village 150 kilometers (90 miles)
southeast of the capital Jakarta, where at least one person was
killed by the disease and another sickened. Four other people died
before tests could be taken to see if they had bird flu.
The H5N1 virus has killed at least 140 people worldwide since it
began ravaging Asian poultry stocks in late 2003, 45 of them in
Indonesia, the world's worst affected country, according to the World
Health Organization.

[WHO Update 27 on the avian influenza situation in Indonesia (see:
Avian influenza, human (121): Indonesia, Thailand 20060817.2302)
concluded that there was no evidence of human-to-human transmission
in Cikelet village even in the case of 2 close relatives. The 2 young
men could have acquired their infection from a shared environmental
source. The currently recognized incubation period for H5N1 infection
of 2 to 8 days made human-human transmission between the 2 highly
improbable. Only 2 of the 7 suspected cases in the village have been
confirmed by laboratory testing. Further information on the current
case is awaited; diagnostic samples from the others are not
available. - Mod.CP]
