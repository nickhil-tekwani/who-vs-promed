Health officials have issued an alert, saying 9 people have died in an ongoing invasive group A _Streptococcus_ outbreak in the London, Ontario [Canada] area.

The outbreak was declared more than 18 months ago and the Middlesex-London Health Unit says more than 132 cases of infection have been reported since [1 Apr 2016].

Of the cases, 22 percent required treatment in intensive care, 15 percent had streptococcal toxic shock syndrome, and 15 percent had necrotizing fasciitis -- also called "flesh-eating" disease.

Associate Medical Officer of Health Dr Gayane Hovhannisyan says about half of the cases have been among injection drug users and/or people without access to stable housing.

Symptoms depend on the site of the infection and may include fever, chills, sore throat, dizziness, confusion, severe pain, redness, or swelling around a wound or injured area.

Hovhannisyan says the alert has been issued because the health unit is seeing an increase in infections among people who have no connection to the outbreak in people who inject drugs or don't have stable housing. "We need a better understanding of what's happening, which is why we've issued this alert," she said [Mon 27 Nov 2017] in a news release.

The bacteria are spread by direct contact with nose and throat secretions from an infected person, or by direct contact with infected wounds or sores on the skin. While the infections can occur year-round, the health unit said [Mon 27 Nov 2017] that the number of infections tends to increase during the winter. It said the majority of _Streptococcus_ infections cause relatively mild illnesses like strep throat, but sometimes more serious and potentially life-threatening infections are able to get into muscles, blood and other organs.

The health unit advises regular handwashing, covering the mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing, avoid sharing drinking and eating utensils, and to not share drug paraphernalia in an effort to avoid infection.

[ProMED-mail is grateful to Dr David Fisman, Toronto, Canada and to Roberta Creti, Rome, Italy, for this report of an ongoing outbreak due to group A streptococci (GAS), initially in homeless people and injection drug users in London, Ontario (Canada) that has involved more than 132 cases with 9 deaths since [1 Apr 2016] and has now spread into the general population. London is a city of 383 822 residents in Southwestern Ontario, Canada, about 200 km (124 mi) southwest of Toronto (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London,_Ontario). A map showing the location of London, Ontario can be found at https://goo.gl/maps/cstXk2YEkmk.


A prior ProMED-mail post in April 2017, from Dr Michael Finkelstein, reported an outbreak of GAS infection that began in March 2016 and involved 55 confirmed infections and 14 carriers (5 invasive and 50 non-invasive infections) in residents of Seaton House, a shelter for homeless in Toronto. Genotyping established that this outbreak was mainly due to a single clone of genotype emm74; one person had died (ProMED-mail Streptococcus, group A - Canada (02): (ON) fatal, homeless shelter, emm74, clonal 20170406.4952247).

Another ProMED-mail post in August 2017, from Dr No√©mie Savard, reported an outbreak of invasive GAS genotype emm74 that began in March 2017 and involved 10 cases in homeless people in Montreal; 3 people had died. An additional 18 patients had non-invasive GAS; of the 11 cases with genotype results, 5 had the genotype emm74 (45 percent) and the genotype was pending at the time for the other 6 cases (ProMED-mail Streptococcus, group A - Canada (03): (QC) fatal, homeless, emm74, RFI 20170816.5252887).

It would be important to learn if genotyping has been done on the London, Ontario outbreak strains to see if they match each other and also if they match the Toronto strains. More information on the London outbreak would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.ML
