Summary
--------
- Influenza activity in the northern hemisphere temperate zones remained at inter-seasonal levels.
- In most parts of tropical Asia, influenza activity decreased.
- In Central America and the Caribbean, influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) transmission declined. RSV, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and influenza A(H3N2) were the main respiratory viruses reported.
- In tropical South America, influenza A(H1N1)pmd09 virus predominated. A significant increase in influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 activity was observed in Peru in the middle of July 2013, while influenza activity in general decreased in Venezuela, Ecuador and Brazil.
- Influenza activity peaked in the temperate areas of South America and in South Africa in late June 2013. Influenza activity in these areas was primarily associated with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus throughout the season, with increasing influenza A(H3N2) virus detections observed towards the end.
- In Australia and New Zealand, numbers of influenza viruses detected and rates of influenza-like illness were lower than in previous years but showed an increasing trend. Influenza A(H3N2) and type B were much more commonly detected than A(H1N1)pdm09 in both countries.
- As of 11 Aug 2013, a total of 135 cases of influenza A(H7N9) virus infection were reported. For more details see: http://who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/influenza_h7n9/en/index.html.

Countries in the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere
-----------------------------------------------
North America

Overall influenza activity in North America remained at low levels throughout the region. In Canada and the United States of America (USA), influenza activity remained at inter-seasonal levels. The USA has reported 16 human infections with influenza A(H3N2)v virus in 2013 since the 1st case in June 2013. For more details, see http://www.cdc.gov/flu/swineflu/h3n2v-cases.htm.

Mexico continued to report some influenza activity. According to laboratory data, from the beginning of August 2013, 175 samples were tested, and 14.3 percent were positive for influenza. Among the positive influenza samples, 92.0 percent were influenza A, of which 43.5 percent were A(H1N1)pdm09, and 58.1 percent were A(H3N2), and 8.0 percent were influenza B.

Europe

Influenza activity in Europe remained at inter-seasonal levels. Consultation rates for ILI and ARI [influenza-like illness and acute respiratory infection] were at low levels for all countries in the region. None of the specimens collected from sentinel sites tested positive for influenza.

Northern Africa and the Western Asia region

Influenza activity was low in the Northern Africa and western Asia regions.

Northern Asia

Influenza activity in the temperate region of Asia remained at inter-seasonal levels since late May 2013.

As of 11 Aug 2013, 135 cases of influenza A(H7N9) were identified, of which 44 died. There were no new cases since the last update. More and updated information is posted at: http://who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/influenza_h7n9/en/index.html.

Countries in the tropical zone
-------------------------
Tropical countries of the Americas/Central America and the Caribbean

In the Caribbean and Central America, respiratory virus infections continued their decreasing trend. All samples testing positive for influenza were influenza type A. Co-circulation of influenza A(H1N1)pmd09 and influenza A(H3N2) continued in Cuba, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic and Nicaragua, whereas Guatemala reported mainly influenza A(H1N1)pmd09 virus detections. Influenza transmission was still high in Costa Rica: in the last 3 weeks, over 30 percent of the analyzed samples were positive for influenza. During the last weeks, RSV predominated in Cuba and Guatemala, and adenovirus predominated in Honduras.

In tropical South America, influenza activity decreased overall. In Colombia, the proportions of outpatient visits, hospitalizations, and ARI-associated ICU admissions did not change significantly from the previous week. Of the samples analyzed, 10 percent was positive for influenza (mainly influenza A(H1N1)pdm09). In Venezuela, after having peaked in early June 2013, the ARI and pneumonia levels returned to their expected activity levels for this time of the year. The percentage positive samples for respiratory virus decreased in the last weeks to 0 percent. A decrease in SARI [severe acute respiratory infection] hospitalizations was also seen in Ecuador. Of the 146 SARI samples analyzed in the last 2 weeks, 47 percent tested positive for influenza (of which 85 percent were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09). A sharp increase in influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 transmission was, however, observed in Peru in the middle of July 2013, and transmission levels have continued to be high. In Bolivia co-circulation of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and influenza B subtypes continued. Although the SARI hospitalizations decreased, still 22 percent (Santa Cruz) and 31 percent (La Paz) of the tested samples were positive for influenza. In Brazil, the influenza virus detections in both ILI and SARI cases decreased.

Central African tropical region

Cote d'Ivoire and Ghana reported circulating influenza virus. Cote d'Ivoire reported predominantly A(H1N1)pdm09 and influenza B transmission, whereas in Ghana, there were more detections of influenza A(H3N2). Cameroon and Kenya reported low influenza activity. After having peaked at the end of May 2013, influenza activity in Madagascar continued to decrease, and currently only influenza B has been detected.

Tropical Asia

Influenza transmission in southern Asia remained consistently low in all countries. Both influenza A(H3N2) and influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses were reported in this area. In the south of China and the Hong Kong, China Special Administrative Region (SAR), a change in circulating influenza subtype from A(H1N1)pdm09 (which predominated throughout the last season [2012]) to A(H3N2) was observed over the last weeks. In addition in the Hong Kong SAR, a slight increase in influenza associated hospital admissions was seen in the 0-4 and over 65 year old patients. In Southeast Asia, influenza activity has been decreasing with continued circulation of influenza A(H3N2) virus predominating in Thailand and influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus predominating in Cambodia.

Countries in the temperate zone of the southern hemisphere
---------------------------------------------
Temperate countries of South America

Influenza and RSV activity showed a decreasing trend, and RSV continued to be the most common respiratory virus detected in temperate South America. Influenza virus transmission continued to decrease since peaking in June 2013 and was primarily associated with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, with the exception of Paraguay, where influenza A(H3N2) was the predominant virus.

In Chile, the national ILI consultation rate and the proportion of SARI-associated hospitalizations continued to decline. RSV remained the most common respiratory virus detected. Among 1418 samples collected, only 4 percent were positive for influenza viruses (mainly influenza A(H1N1)pdm09). In Argentina, the number of ILI and SARI cases peaked in week 26 but has declined since then. This decline was also reflected in the samples positive for influenza viruses. Of the 1405 samples analyzed, only 5 percent were positive for influenza.

In Paraguay, influenza activity has been decreasing since week 27. Among the positive samples, influenza A(H3N2) and influenza B predominated.

In Uruguay, influenza activity continued to decrease. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and RSV were the predominant respiratory viruses detected.

Temperate countries of Southern Africa

After a peak in influenza activity in South Africa due to influenza A(H1N1)pmd09 in June 2013, a slight increase was observed in the last few weeks due to increased influenza A(H3N2) and influenza B circulation. This change of influenza subtype was seen in both ILI and SARI cases.

Oceania, Melanesia and Polynesia

ILI activity in Australia, New Zealand, and the Pacific Islands showed an increasing trend during the last few weeks and may be indicating the start of a late season [outbreak]. Across jurisdictions of Australia, the distribution of influenza types and subtypes was variable. In Victoria, there was a predominance of influenza type B, whereas most other states reported a predominance of influenza type A, with New South Wales reporting mostly A(H1N1)pdm09 and Western Australia mostly A(H3N2) virus detections. Influenza positivity levels ranged from 11.0 percent in the national sentinel laboratory surveillance to 20.5 percent in the Australian Sentinel Practices Research Network (ASPREN). Over the past few weeks, there was a continued seasonal increase in influenza associated hospitalisations. Around 10 percent of influenza cases were admitted directly to the ICU. The age distribution of hospital admissions showed peaks in the 0-9 and over 60 years age groups. In New Zealand, influenza activity continued to remain below the baseline threshold, but with increasing trends. 136 out of 349 samples received were positive for influenza: 64 were influenza B, 51 were influenza A(H3N2), 9 were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and 12 influenza A (not subtyped). In Auckland and Counties Manukau District Health Boards, influenza activity increased slightly in community surveillance and decreased slightly in hospital surveillance.

[Influenza disease has virtually disappeared from the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere. In the southern hemisphere, A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2), and influenza B are present at different frequencies in different countries, but no new influenza viruses have made an appearance. The avian influenza viruses affecting humans remain localised and currently are not spreading. Apart from the various influenza viruses, respiratory syncytial virus remains the most prevalent respiratory virus. - Mod.CP]
