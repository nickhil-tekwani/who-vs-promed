[Inoue Tadahiro has kindly brought this Japanese website to our attention
and extracted the following table. The Japanese version has significantly
more information and a useful series of diagrams plotting the apparent
spread of this epidemic through the island - quickly in a matter of days
from the original reporting area to the whole of the western half of the
island, and now when all but three small districts are affected. One should
visit both sites. AHEAD-Mod MHJ]
The information available is summarized as follows from "FMD on Taiwan
Information".
<http://ss.niah.affrc.go.jp/FMD/index.html>
(Japanese version)
<http://ss.niah.affrc.go.jp/FMD/FMD_on_Taiwan_1997.html>
(English version)
The Japanese version has many figures, tables and photos; it also has the
newest information for FMD in Taiwan.

PS
I am a staff of National Institute of Animal Health Japan but now I am
staying in Uruguay for Cooperation Technique. So I haven't any more detailed
information for FMD in Taiwan. If you want to ask something, contact to
www@niah.affrc.go.jp(WWW Administrator) or others.
