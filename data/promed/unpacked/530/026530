Severe bird flu registered in China, 25 km from Kazakhstan border
-----------------------------------------------------------------
A large outbreak of bird flu among birds has been registered in the
People's Republic of China, 25 km from the border with East Kazakhstan.
According to WHO, 1042 ducks [they might mean geese, as also officially
reported by the Chinese authorities; see item 2 and 20050608.1591. -
Mod.AS] were detected with symptoms of bird flu, and 406 of them died. This
has been said by the deputy health care minister, chief state sanitary
inspector of Kazakhstan, Anatoliy Belonog.
According to the Chinese veterinary services, at one of the private farms
of Chuguchak (Tacheng) in SUAR province, 13 000 birds have been destroyed.
Other control measures include isolation and disinfection. In addition,
emergency poultry vaccination was carried out at all neighboring fowl-farms.
According to the view of the Chinese experts, bird flu virus spread in
western China is related to its carry-over by migrating birds from South
Asia via Tibet and the Himalayas.
To date, 54 fatal cases of bird flu have been registered among the
population of Viet Nam, Cambodia, and Thailand. Consequently, necessary
measures are being undertaken by the Kazakh Ministry to prevent the
introduction of disease into the territory of Kazakhstan. In all regions,
stricter sanitary-quarantine control measures are undertaken at all
crossing points along the border and at international airports with traffic
to South Eastern Asia.

Country situation - China
-------------------------
The 519 wild bird deaths, including bar-headed geese, great black-headed
gulls, brown-headed gulls, ruddy shelducks, and great cormorants, at the
Qinghai Lake Nature Reserve in Gangcha County, Qinghai Province were
confirmed by the National AI Reference Laboratory (Harbin) to be due to
H5N1 avian influenza (AI) strain infection. The government's control
measures included compulsory vaccination around the outbreak areas and
along migration routes and the nearby regions. More than 3 million doses of
vaccine against the H5N1 strain of the avian influenza virus were
dispatched to Qinghai Province. Qinghai Province adopted a series of
measures, such as sealing off the epidemic area, the use of disinfectants
in the affected zones as well as the administration of vaccines. Death of
migratory birds was 1st reported in Naisuoma Village in Gangcha County on 4
May 2005. The 0.27 square kilometre island where the dead birds were found
is home to more than 100 000 birds, including rare species, such as swans,
black-necked cranes, and brown-headed gulls. The Chinese government has
temporarily banned visitors from nature reserves.
Another outbreak of HPAI H5N1 was reported on a farm in Tacheng city,
Tacheng district, Xinjiang Province on 8 Jun 2005. The index farm had 2177
geese, and 1042 were positive for H5N1, and, as of 8 Jun 2005, 460 had
died. More than 13 000 birds were culled in order to contain the new
outbreak. Xinjiang authorities have adopted various control measures,
including modified stamping out and vaccination.

[The concern of the Kazakh authorities is justified, since the spread of
H5N1 into Tacheng means a significant leap of the virus into central Asia.
The 31st update of FAO AIDE (Avian Influenza Disease Emergency), from which
the 2nd item above was derived, includes the following statement: "Overall
numbers of outbreaks have decreased, a pattern similar to that observed
last year [2004]. This is a good opportunity for all the affected and at
risk countries to review contingency plans and be prepared for possible
outbreaks that might occur in the forthcoming cooler months." One cannot
but agree. - Mod.AS]
