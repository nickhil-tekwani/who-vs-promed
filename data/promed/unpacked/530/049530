Thoughts that come to mind with your case include three possibilities:
1. missed lesion on chest film (AIDS and pulmonary collapse being
noteworthy), in which case there may have been risk of aerosol transmission
if the patient had been coughing or receiving aerosol therapy;
2. primary infection, in which case there is minimal transmission risk in
hospital but public health may want to investigate a community source;
3. miliary tuberculosis, in which case there is a risk of transmission to
either laboratory staff who might have been exposed via aerosolized urine
during test procedures, or to autopsy staff;
all assuming, of course, that the organism isn't an atypical mycobacterial
species and that there is no reason to suspect pseudoinfection (false
positive culture results have been documented in the literature).
I assume that the CDC Guideline you refer to is MMWR 1994;43(RR-13).

Addressing the assessment of risk for transmission of TB in an HIV + patient:
You may wish to revise your guidelines in light of the fact that
the CXR [chest X-ray] of an HIV + individual with TB disease may
often not only not appear unusual but may even appear entirely
normal (see Core Curriculum on Tuberculosis, 3rd edition, 1994).
My personal approach in this matter is to use the following criteria
for determining potential risk of pulmonary TB in an HIV + patient:
History of persistent cough (>2 weeks) plus ANY TWO of the
following symptoms - fever, anorexia, hemoptysis, weight loss,
night sweats. I include neither PPD [tuberculin skin test] nor
CXR interpretation as criteria in such instances. Subsequently, any
patient meeting these criteria is assumed to be infectious until
TB has been ruled out. Hope this helps.
