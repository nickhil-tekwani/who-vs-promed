A total of 11 pupils from the school N19 in Novokuybyshevsk [Samara
province] were poisoned by datura [a dangerous plant containing
atropine-like alkaloids]. All the children were rushed to the city
hospital. A nurse and a doctor stayed on duty at the school to
identify any new cases. All schoolchildren are also being
[interviewed] by drug abuse specialists. The public health
administration of the city collected samples of the plant and
submitted them for testing to the department of Pharmacology at the
Medical University of Samara.

[There are a number of species of _Datura_, whose common names include
moon trumpet, jimson weed, and devil's thorn apple. And there are a
number of different species giving a slightly different shape to the
leaves or flowers. However, they all contain the same toxic agents,
just in slightly different proportions. Photos may be seen at
<http://www.wildflowersofontario.ca/jimsonweed1.jpg> or
<http://www.ansci.cornell.edu/plants/jimsonweed/jimson4.jpg>.
The thorny fruit that contributes to its name may be viewed at
<http://www.ipm.ucdavis.edu/PMG/D/W-SO-DSTR-FR.001.html>.

The plant has a distinctive white trumpet shaped bloom. The seeds and
flowers of the plants contain tropane alkaloids such as scopolamine,
hyoscyamine, and atropine. The alkaloids cause tachycardia,
hyperthermia, hyperemia, and hallucinations, which may result in
bizarre and abnormal behavior. Mistakenly the seeds have been used by
some in a substitute for other illicit drugs in hopes of producing the
same kind of "high." It is possible for deaths to occur from this
because of the cardiac properties. Those recovering from the
hallucinations and photophobia report it to be entirely unpleasant.

The memory tool for jimson weed intoxication is "red as a beet, dry as
a bone" (flushed, hot, red skin) and "mad as a hatter" (from Alice in
Wonderland, for its hallucinogenic properties.) The seeds have been
collected by addicts trying to get "high" because of the
hallucinogenic properties. The cardiac properties associated with
these alkaloids have resulted in death.

This brief article does not tell us if the plant is near the school,
which would allow access to the seeds, or if the seeds were
distributed by an individual or even included in a salad, as has
happened in some locations.

Treatment for _Datura_ spp. Intoxication is physostigmine, also known
by the trade name Antilirium. - Mod.TG]
