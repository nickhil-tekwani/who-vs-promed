SEWAGE-LOVING GULLS COULD SPREAD E COLI
Mar. 20/97
LONDON - In the latest edition of New Scientist magazine, researchers for
Britain's Public Health Laboratory Service and the University of Lancaster
have found that seagulls feasting on sewage, garbage dumps and farm waste
could help to spread the poisonous E coli bacteria. They analysed 700
samples of gull droppings and found three percent were infected with E
coli 0157, a strain of a common gut bacteria that can cause food
poisoning. The birds roost on farmland and defecate onto grass and into
cattle troughs, which could spread the bacteria to cattle."
Note that the 3% positives is similar to the percentages found in the Osaka
and Scotland human sampling.

[Surprise, surprise. Considering the normal, non-fastidious feeding habits
of British seagulls, which can spend the winter sometimes far inland, I am
surprised that only 3% of the 700 droppings sampled contained O157. But
isn't this an expected prevalence of this bacteria in (healthy) cattle
faeces? One more reason to be careful where you are while eating sandwiches
on a British beach. Martin Hugh-Jones, ProMED-Ahead moderator]
