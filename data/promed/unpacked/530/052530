Two Japanese encephalitis (JE) cases have been confirmed in the North Fly
District, Western Province, a first for Papua New Guinea. The
mosquito-borne viral encephalitis was confirmed in two cases (from Kokonda
and Ipoknai) diagnosed at Rumginae Hospital by Dr. John Oakley late last
year, according to information received from Professor John Mackenzie of
the WHO Collaborating Centre for Viral Diseases in SE Asia and Western
Pacific. There has also been an increasing seroprevalence for antibodies
against JE detected in the Rumginae area in recent years indicating that
the disease is spreading. Currently we are awaiting results of further
serology from the lower Ok Tedi and Star mountain areas but the
confirmation of clinical cases makes it imperative to revise our
immunization policies for JE, particularly for those people going to work
on the dredging site (which is located between Ipoknai and Kokonda).
Infections rates are high in endemic areas during peak transmission times,
with encephalitis resulting in 1 of 20 to 1,000 infections
Dr. Oakley has requested information on a cheaper means of obtaining
vaccine against JE. He has been quoted AUD$240 for a course of JE-VAX from
Sydney but has heard there is a new vaccine developed by US and Chinese
researchers in China which is much cheaper.
Can any one help?

[In reply to our inquiry to Professor Mackenzie, we have the following. -

Presumptive JE infection was demonstrated serologically by Dr. Roy Hall and
Cheryl Johansen at the University of Queensland, and this diagnosis was
confirmed by Dr. Annette Broom at the University of Western Australia and
Mrs. Debbie Phillips at Queensland Health Scientific Services. Serological
studies using a competitive ELISA have been carried out on sera collected
from a number of different sites in south-western Papua New Guinea by
Cheryl Johansen and Dr. Hall at the University of Queensland in Brisbane
and by Wayne Melrose at James Cook University in Townsville. They found
that JE virus has been active in the Daru area of Western Province since at
least 1989 with 21% of sera found to be antibody positive. An increasing
antibody positivity has also been observed in the Upper Fly region, rising
from 8% in 1990-1991 to 24% in 1993, and JE antibody positive sera have
been observed in Kareema region of Gulf Province and Lake Kutubu in
Southern Highlands Province. However no JE virus activity has been observed
in northern or eastern PNG, although antibodies to Murray Valley
encephalitis and Kunjin viruses have been found in sera collected in these
areas. Most pig sera collected from Western Province by Dr. Jack Shield in
1995-96 were also seropositive for JE virus. The present increased JE
virus activity and the two human cases in the Upper Fly region has occurred
during a period of extreme drought. I understand that there has been
increased mosquito breeding in the area as streams and rivers dry to form
pools of stagnant water, and the flushing action of running streams ceases.
I would assume that these reduced areas of water may also concentrate water
birds and feral animals, allowing a greater potential for arboviral
transmission.

Dr. Flew's question regarding a source for a less expensive vaccine? Time
may be of the essence. - Mod.CHC
