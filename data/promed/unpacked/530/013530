In answer to [the query about the type & origin of these cases:
The two cases were _V. cholerae_ O1: Biotype El Tor : Subtype Ogawa.
Both cases, January 1999 and August 1999, originated in the Pacific Islands.

[This is very interesting, since the only Pacific island to notify cases of
cholera to WHO up to 30 June 1999 was Guam. We would like further details
of cholera in other islands - Mod.JW
