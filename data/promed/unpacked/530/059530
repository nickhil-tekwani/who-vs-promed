3 more anthrax cases detected in Orissa
---------------------------------------
Official sources said 3 fresh anthrax cases were detected on Wednesday [1
Jul 2009] from Orissa's Sundargarh, barely a week after 12 people in the
district tested positive for the disease. All 3, aged 55, 30, and 50,
hailed from Dhudinua village of the district, nearly 80 km (50 mi) from
Rourkela. The patients were undergoing treatment at Balishankara primary
health centre, the sources said, adding that a medical team from the
district headquarters has rushed to the village.

A similar report of an anthrax outbreak was reported last week [27 Jun
2009] in Pindapathar village of the district, where 12 people were found
affected by the disease [see ProMED-mail archive no. 20090629.2352].

The tribal people living in remote villages of the district, particularly
in Subdega and Balishankara blocks, often eat meat of dead domestic
animals, they said, adding that an awareness campaign was launched among them.

[This year (2009) to date we have had outbreaks reported in the Orissa
districts of Rayagada (24 Mar), Kortaput (14 Jun), Malkangiri (16 Jun),
Sundargarh (27 Jun) and now in a 2nd village in Sundargarh. It is patently
a widespread problem in Orissa.

Rourkela is a large industrial city, surrounded by a range of hills and
encircled by rivers. It is the 2nd largest city in Orissa, with a
population of some 500 000. It is situated in an area with the richest
deposit of mineral wealth in Orissa. Rourkela came into prominence in 1955,
with the establishment of the 1st of the 3 public sector steel plants in
India. Its markets have the potential to attract contaminated meat.
