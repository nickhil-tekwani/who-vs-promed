During the 1st 8 months of 2015, Colombian health officials have reported nearly 650 cases of Chagas disease and nearly 5000 cases of leishmaniasis

- Chagas disease = 647 cases, 91 percent chronic;
- Leishmaniasis = 4919 cases, 4849 cutaneous (CL), 56 mucosal (MCL) and 14 visceral (VL)).

Chagas disease
---------------------
The Instituto Nacional de Salud reports that through 29 Aug 2015, Colombia has seen 647 accumulated cases of Chagas disease. The vast majority of cases are considered chronic (91 percent), while the remainder are acute infections. Boyaca state has reported the most chronic Chagas cases, accounting for 18 percent of the total.

Leishmaniasis
-------------------
The vector borne parasitic disease has been confirmed in 4919 individuals, with the vast majority of cases being the cutaneous leishmaniasis. The breakdown on types of leishmaniasis reported is as follows: 4849 cases (98.6 percent) of cutaneous leishmaniasis, 56 cases (1.1 percent) of mucosal leishmaniasis and 14 cases (0.3 percent) of visceral leishmaniasis.

[Both Chagas disease (South American trypanosomiasis) and leishmaniasis are endemic in Colombia.

Colombia is one of the 3 countries with the highest number of _Leishmania_ species affecting humans in the world (7 species in total). Around 90.3 percent of all cases are CL; 0.4 percent are MCL, and 0.3 percent are VL. The disease predominates in a large part of the country, especially in sylvatic foci and in the inter-Andean valleys, where working in coffee plantations can be seen as a risk factor. Epidemic outbreaks of CL caused by _L. braziliensis_, _L. guyanensis_ and _L. panamensis_, with intra and peridomiciliary transmission, have been reported since 1984. Urbanization of the disease has been observed in recent years (Alvat J et al. Leishmaniasis Worldwide and Global Estimates of Its Incidence. PLoS ONE 7(5): e35671). - Mod.EP
