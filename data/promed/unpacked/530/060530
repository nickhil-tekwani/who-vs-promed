INFLUENZA, PANDEMIC: DISEASE ARCHEOLOGY (4)

From: "Robert E. Shope, M.D." <Robert.Shope@UTMB.EDU>

I cannot confirm David Sencer's reference to "Bob Shope" in 1951. Most
likely he was thinking about Richard E. Shope, my father. I do not recall
that my father studied materials from Alaska; more likely it would have been
Tommy Francis at the University of Michigan. A literature search might be
useful, since Francis usually published his work and might have published
negative results.
Another source with an excellent memory about the AFEB is
Ted Woodward at the University of Maryland Medical School in Baltimore.
