[The key to control of vector borne diseases such as dengue and chikungunya is intensive vector management, not only when the epidemic or outbreak situation arises, but particularly during the low activity season. Use of personal protective measures must be propagated for prevention of mosquito bites such as wearing clothing to minimize skin exposure to the day-biting mosquito, application of repellents to exposed skin or clothing, use of screens in rooms, use of mosquito coils or other insecticide vaporizers and use of mosquito nets or insecticide-treated mosquito nets during daytime sleeping, particularly of young children or sick or older individuals. Furthermore, intensive efforts for community involvement in the control measures through education and participation of the religious and social members can make considerable impact. - Mod.UBA
