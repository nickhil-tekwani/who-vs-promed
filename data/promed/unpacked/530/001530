Equine plague in this region
----------------------------
[Following] its appearance last week [27-31 Aug 2007] in the
department of Mbour, where it caused the death of 5 horses in the
locality of Niaganiao (rural communauty of Malincounda), equine
plague [African horse sickness, AHS] is now present in all the 3
departments of this region.
According to Dr. Doudou Path Ndoye, 2 cases were notified in the
rural community of Ndieyenne Sirah. A total of 4 horses died in the
department of Tivaouane. Local officials said, although they have no
idea about where the dead horses were buried, it is more likely that
the death is caused by equine plague.
Despite the [fact that the] disease is spreading all over in the
region, Dr. Doudou Path Ndoye thinks that the situation is under
control because preventive and protective measures have been
implemented in the region. However, the surveillance of the disease
should continue and appropriate preventive measure should be undertaken.

[On 25 Aug 2007 we posted a request for information on suspected AHS
cases in several locations (Kadji, Khoi-Khoi, Bari, and Thilla) in
Senegal's department of Linguere (Center), where several horses died
suddenly. Samples were reportedly sent to a laboratory, but results
were not available and, as a matter of fact, are still awaited.
However, AHSV serotype 2 had been diagnosed in samples from Senegal
in June 2007 by the Onderstepoort laboratory and later sequenced at
Pirbright. Earlier in 2007, Nigeria has also experienced outbreaks of AHSV-2.
