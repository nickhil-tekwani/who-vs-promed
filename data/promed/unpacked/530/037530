Ebola Haemorrhagic Fever in South Sudan - WHO Update 7
---------------------------------------------------
As of Sun 20 Jun 2004, the health authorities in Yambio County and the team
assisting them in the outbreak have reassessed the number of cases of Ebola
haemorrhagic fever (EHF) in view of the clinical presentation of the
disease, epidemiology and laboratory results. As a result of the
reclassification, 18 cases and 6 deaths of EHF have now been reported.

Following the latest laboratory results from the WHO Collaborating Centre
at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), United States,
12 of the 30 most recently reported cases (see previous report
<http://www.who.int/csr/don/2004_06_11/en/>) have now been classified as
measles cases. Measles cases have been present in the community and were
first reported to the WHO South Sudan Early Warning and Response Network
(EWARN) in the 2nd week of March 2004, but the increase in the number of
cases was detected because of the active surveillance system established
for EHF. Additional laboratory tests are under way.

Active surveillance and follow-up of contacts is ongoing.

[The most recent figures released by WHO on Thu 10 Jun 2004, reported a
total of 30 cases, including 7 deaths, from Ebola haemorrhagic fever (case
fatality, 23 percent) in Yambio, Western Equatoria, south Sudan (see
previous report <http://www.who.int/csr/don/2004_06_07/en/> or ProMED-mail
post "Ebola hemorrhagic fever - Sudan (W. Equatoria) (04) 20040609.1547".)
Overall, 157 contacts were being followed up.

The reclassification of 12 of these cases -- and [presumably] one of the
deaths as measles cases -- raises the Ebola hemorrhagic fever case fatality
estimate from 23.3 to 33.3 percent. The misdiagnosis of measles cases as
Ebola hemorrhagic fever is no doubt a consequence of the enhanced severity
of measles virus infection in deprived communities under stress. - Mod.CP]
