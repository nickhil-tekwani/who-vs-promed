While interesting, the moderator's comment [in ProMED-Mail post number
20080127.0343] about the origin of the word 'ahi contains a significant error.
The Hawaiian word for fire is ahi. The Hawaiian word for tuna is 'ahi. In
the Hawaiian language, the mark ' is called an okina and functions as a
consonant. Thus ahi and 'ahi are 2 different words, just as its and it's
are 2 different words. Unlike the latter 2 words, however, the 2 Hawaiian
words are pronounced differently, as the okina signifies a glottal stop.
(The symbol for the okina is not the same as the apostrophe, it is written
like an upside down apostrophe. There is, unfortunately, no separate
character for the okina on most computers.)
I am not an expert in the Hawaiian language and cannot speak to the origin
of either word, but I do know that they are 2 different words and suspect
that their etymologies are different.

[Professor Frankel is correct, my citation regarding the meaning of the
work seems to be in error.
From <http://www.coralreefnetwork.com/network/hawaiian.htm>:
"The 'okina or glottal stop is only found between 2 vowels. A break in
speech is created between the sounds of the 2 vowels. The pronunciation of
the 'okina is similar to saying "oh-oh". The 'okina is written as a
backwards apostrophe."
In 'ahi, the okina is not between 2 vowels as it is in Hawai'i. Perhaps a
native speaker can clarify what this means and the derivation of the 'ahi
tuna term. - Mod.LL]
