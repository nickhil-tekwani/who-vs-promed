Montana: 6th Death in the State Caused by Hantavirus Infection
-------------------------------------------------
Hantavirus has claimed another victim in northern Montana, this time
Glacier National Park's Deputy Superintendent, who died during the last
week of Mar 2004. The Deputy Superintendent, 61, became ill with flu-like
symptoms in mid-March and died on 25 Mar 2004. Blood tests confirming
hantavirus came back after the patient had died, said Elaine Sedlack, a
nurse with the Flathead City-County Health Department.
This is the 23rd case of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome reported in Montana
since 1993 and the 6th death the state Department of Public Health and
Human Services has reported. Most of the deaths have been in north-central
Montana, including 2 in the Great Falls area, and one each in Cut Bank and
in Malta.
Hantavirus infection is contracted by inhaling airborne particles from
dried droppings, urine and saliva of infected deer mice. Sedlack said
officials are still investigating how the deputy superintendent, who lived
in Columbia Falls, contracted the disease. "There was no definite source
that we know of right now," she said. Sedlack said that this is the 1st
human case of hantavirus infection in Flathead County.
Montanans need to make sure mice are not living inside their apartments or
houses, said Rick Douglass, a hantavirus researcher and Montana Tech
biology professor in Butte. "You absolutely have to mouse-proof your
house," he said. That includes filling any holes on the outside of your
home's foundation that you can place your finger into. If you encounter any
mouse droppings or urine, clean it up using one part chlorine bleach to 10
parts water; wear latex gloves and a paper mask. Don't vacuum or sweep up
the droppings; they become dangerous when airborne."
"Hantavirus infection is not contagious, and cats and dogs have not been
known to contract it," the Flathead agency said. Symptoms include high
fever, body aches, chills, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. For more on
