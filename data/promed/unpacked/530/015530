Mumps Update - Capital District Health Authority, Halifax, Nova Scotia
-----------------------------------------------
Overview:
A total of 32 laboratory confirmed cases of mumps have been reported
to Public Health Services (PHS) as of [Thu 5 Apr 2007]. Cases have
been confirmed from throat swabs and urine specimens of persons
meeting the clinical case definition using RT-PCR [ref 1].
Outbreak Description:
The 1st case was reported to PHS on [25 Feb 2007]. By [28 Feb 2007],
5 additional cases had been identified. Epidemiologic investigation
of that initial cluster revealed that the majority of cases (4/6)
occurred in local university students. These students all attended
the same event at a local establishment on [11 Feb 2007], as did a
known mumps case from outside of Nova Scotia. This imported case
appears to have been the source of infection for those 4 students,
and the index case for the wider outbreak. Subsequent cases have
occurred mostly in university students. Epidemiologic links to
confirmed cases have been evident in nearly all subsequent cases thus far.
Preliminary analysis of the 25 cases analyzed so far reveals that the
average age of the cases is 24.3 years old (mean 20.8; range 6-50).
64 percent of cases (16/25) have been male. Five cases have had no
history of mumps in childhood or MMR vaccine; 15 cases report having
had one MMR, and 2 cases have been confirmed as having had 2 doses of
MMR vaccine. Vaccine status for the remaining 3 cases is unknown. 20
of the cases have occurred in university students. No unusual
presentations of mumps or complications of mumps have occurred in
cases presenting to this point.
Outbreak control measures have included:
- Aggressive contact tracing for each lab-confirmed case, including
household and intimate contacts as well as casual contacts through
workplace, recreational, social, and school settings.
- Isolation of cases for 9 days post symptom onset (as opposed to the
5 days used by some authorities)
- Identification of susceptible contacts via serology; this has
resulted in 2 non-immune persons quarantined for 25 days to prevent
possible transmission of disease to high-risk groups.
Vaccine has not been used for outbreak control at this time.
Background:
Measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine was introduced in Nova Scotia in
1975 as a single dose to children 12 to 15 months of age. In 1996 a
2nd dose was added for children 4 to 6 years of age as part of a
Canadian strategy against measles. Since this time, fewer than 2
cases of mumps are reported annually in Nova Scotia, most of which
occur in un-immunized populations [ref 2].
Halifax is an international port city and home to 6 post-secondary
institutions. Of the city's 370 000 inhabitants, approximately 50 000
are believed to fall within the age range affected by the recent
outbreaks, namely ages 15-25 [ref 3]. Vaccine coverage rates have
been high, with our records showing 94-96 percent of children having
received their 2nd dose of MMR just prior to entering elementary
school. However, many current university students were born prior to
1990, and so there remains a large part of this cohort that has
received only one dose of vaccine.
This is the 3rd outbreak in the Halifax area in the past 2 years. The
Halifax outbreaks have occurred in both a doubly vaccinated cohort of
adolescents and a singly vaccinated cohort of young adults [ref 4].
The nature of these outbreaks raises questions as to the efficacy of
the MMR vaccine in each of these cohorts. While the Jeryl-Lynn (JL)
strain, used in Canada since 1988, is thought to induce antibodies in
95 percent of people after one dose, recent studies have estimated
the efficacy of a single dose to be less than 70 percent [refs. 5,6].
Primary vaccine failure has been suggested as a cause of our
outbreaks and of the similar outbreak in the US Midwest in 2006 [ref
7]. However, field studies suggest that reductions in vaccine
efficacy likely reflect a combination of both primary and secondary
failure of the mumps component of the MMR vaccine [ref 6].
Unfortunately, lot numbers for the administered vaccines have not
been available for review during our outbreaks. Our experience with
vaccine administration and handling errors in physician offices here
leads us to believe that these issues may also have led to a degree
of "failure" contributing to our outbreaks.
An ongoing challenge in this outbreak remains the very social and
mobile nature of university students. Indeed, preliminary results of
a social network analysis here have supported our hypothesis that
disease is being spread as much by the off-campus or "extra
curricular" activities of students as by their on-campus activities.
The newspaper reports, including the reports picked up by ProMED,
have been part of media strategy designed to alert persons to the
possibility of mumps in our community and to encourage people to
refrain from socializing until they see a physician, as well as to
refrain from socializing until they are no longer infectious (e.g.
"stay home while you are sick"). Resources for communicable disease
control in this part of Canada are limited by comparison to larger
provinces, and so enforcement of isolation and quarantine has proven
difficult. Analysis of additional options for outbreak management,
including use of vaccine, is ongoing.

[ProMED-mail would like to thank Dr. Gaynor Watson-Creed for this
very complete description of the epidemiology of the outbreak of
mumps in Nova Scotia. Dr. Watson-Creed has done an excellent job of
pointing out the challenges in mumps control confronting the health
sector. The discussion on the multifactoral "vaccine failures"
observed, ranging from failure to get vaccinated (both 1st and 2nd
doses) to failure of the vaccine either primary or secondary, related
to questionable vaccination procedures in vaccine administration and
storage points out complex issues public health officials are facing
for control of vaccine preventible diseases.
We would also like to thank Dr. Richard Gould, Richard Gould MD MHSc
FRCPC, Medical Officer of Health, Western Nova Scotia for responding
to our request for information as well.
