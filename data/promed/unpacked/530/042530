Mexico: 3 suspected cases of West Nile virus infection in border city
---------------------------------------------------------------------
3 people in a Mexican city near the US border are being tested for West
Nile virus in what could be the nation's first human cases of the deadly
mosquitoborne disease, authorities said on Thu 4 Sep 2003. The 3 people
live in Ciudad Juarez, across from El Paso, Texas, where health officials
have confirmed 13 West Nile cases since 1 Aug 2003. Jaime Raul Rojero,
director of disease prevention and control in the northern state of
Chihuahua, said the National Institute for Epidemiological Testing in
Mexico City was looking into the suspected cases.
Oscar Velasquez, an epidemiological expert with the federal Health
Ministry, told Reuters the results of the tests were expected to be ready
on Friday. One person died of West Nile virus in Mexico in 2002, but the
infection was contracted in the United States. No one has yet been
confirmed infected in Mexico. Velasquez said so far the virus has been
found only in animals in Mexico -- in a horse in the northern state of
Nuevo Leon and in a crow in Tabasco on the Gulf of Mexico.
Two people have died of the disease in El Paso, Texas in the past month,
city epidemiology coordinator Efren Ornelas said, adding that recent heavy
rains in normally dry communities were likely linked to the outbreak. "It
was probably the rain that came with the hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico
that gave rise to these cases," he said.
The 3 Ciudad Juarez residents began to experience severe headaches, aches,
and high fevers typical of the disease. They sought medical attention when
the flu-like symptoms did not go away.

[The occurrence of West Nile virus infection along the northern border of
Mexico is not unexpected in view of the increasing number of human cases in
Texas (146 at last count). It is possible also that these suspected cases
in Ciudad Juarez may be travel-related. Further information and
confirmation of the diagnoses are awaited. - Mod.CP]
