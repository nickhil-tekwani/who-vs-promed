Dominant coronavirus mutant contains ghost of pandemic past
-----------------------------------------------------------
The coronavirus mutant that is now dominant in the United States is a member of the omicron family but scientists say it spreads faster than its omicron predecessors, is adept at escaping immunity and might possibly cause more serious disease.

Why? Because it combines properties of both omicron and delta, the nation's dominant variants in the middle of last year [2021].

A genetic trait that harkens back to the pandemic's past, known as a "delta mutation," appears to allow the virus "to escape pre-existing immunity from vaccination and prior infection, especially if you were infected in the omicron wave," said Dr. Wesley Long, a pathologist at Houston Methodist in Texas. That's because the original omicron strain that swept the world didn't have the mutation.

The omicron "subvariant" gaining ground in the U.S. -- known as BA.2.12.1 and responsible for 58% of U.S. COVID-19 cases last week -- isn't the only one affected by the delta mutation. The genetic change is also present in the omicron relatives that together dominate in South Africa, known as BA.4 and BA.5. Those have exactly the same mutation as delta, while BA.2.12.1 has one that's nearly identical.

This genetic change is bad news for people who caught the original omicron and thought that made them unlikely to get COVID-19 again soon. Although most people don't know for sure which variant caused their illness, the original omicron caused a giant wave of cases late last year [2021] and early this year [2022].

Long said lab data suggests a prior infection with the original omicron is not very protective against reinfection with the new mutants, though the true risk of being reinfected no matter the variant is unique to every person and situation.

In a twist, however, those sickened by delta previously may have some extra armor to ward off the new mutants. A study released before it was reviewed by other scientists, by researchers at Ohio State University, found that COVID patients in intensive care with delta infections induced antibodies that were better at neutralizing the new mutants than patients who caught the original omicron.

"The omicron infection antibody does not appear to protect well against the subvariants compared to delta," said Dr. Shan-Lu Liu, a study author who co-directs the viruses and emerging pathogens program at Ohio State.

But Liu said the level of protection a delta infection provides depends partly on how long ago someone was ill. That's because immunity wanes over time.

People who got sick with delta shouldn't think of themselves as invulnerable to the new subvariants, especially if they're unvaccinated, Long said. "I wouldn't say anyone is safe."

One bright spot? Booster shots can provide strong protection against the new mutants, Liu said. In general, vaccines and prior infection can protect people from the worst outcomes of COVID-19. At this point, scientists say, it's too early to know if the new mutant gaining ground in the U.S. will cause a significant uptick in new cases, hospitalizations and deaths.

Scientists are still trying to figure out how virulent these new mutants are. Long said he hasn't seen anything that answers that question for him, but Liu said emerging data points toward more serious illness. Liu said the subvariants have properties suggesting they spread more efficiently cell-to-cell.

The virus "just hides in the cell and spreads through cell-to-cell contact," Liu said. "That's more scary because the virus does not come out for the antibody to work."

Dr. Eric Topol, head of Scripps Research Translational Institute, said the new mutants certainly don't appear less virulent than previous versions of omicron, and whether they are more virulent or not "will become clear in the months ahead."

In the meantime, scientists expect the latest powerhouse mutants to spread quickly, since they are more transmissible than their predecessors.

Though home testing makes it tough to track all U.S. COVID cases, data from Johns Hopkins University shows that cases are averaging nearly 107 000 a day, up from about 87 000 2 weeks ago. And new hospital admissions of patients with COVID-19 have been trending upwards since around mid-April [2022], according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

"I'm hopeful that we don't see a similar increase in hospitalizations that we've had in prior waves," Long said. "But with COVID, any time you have lots of people being infected, it's just a numbers game. Some of those people are going to be severe. Some of those people are going to need hospitalization. Some of them, unfortunately, are going to pass away."

You Are Going to Get COVID Again ... And Again ... And Again
------------------------------------------------------------

Two and a half years and billions of estimated infections into this pandemic, SARS-CoV-2's visit has clearly turned into a permanent stay. Experts knew from early on that, for almost everyone, infection with this coronavirus would be inevitable. As James Hamblin memorably put it back in February 2020, "You're Likely to Get the Coronavirus." By this point, in fact, most Americans have. But now, as wave after wave continues to pummel the globe, a grimmer reality is playing out. You're not just likely to get the coronavirus. You're likely to get it again and again and again.

"I personally know several individuals who have had COVID in almost every wave," says Salim Abdool Karim, a clinical infectious-diseases epidemiologist and the director of the Center for the AIDS Program of Research in South Africa, which has experienced 5 meticulously tracked surges, and where just 1/3 of the population is vaccinated. Experts doubt that clip of reinfection -- several times a year -- will continue over the long term, given the continued ratcheting up of immunity and potential slowdown of variant emergence. But a more sluggish rate would still lead to lots of comeback cases. Aubree Gordon, an epidemiologist at the University of Michigan, told me that her best guess for the future has the virus infiltrating each of us, on average, every 3 years or so. "Barring some intervention that really changes the landscape," she said, "we will all get SARS-CoV-2 multiple times in our life."

If Gordon is right about this thrice(ish)-per-decade pace, that would be on par with what we experience with flu viruses, which scientists estimate hit us about every 2-5 years, less often in adulthood. It also matches up well with the documented cadence of the 4 other coronaviruses that seasonally trouble humans, and cause common colds. Should SARS-CoV-2 joins this mix of microbes that irk us on an intermittent schedule, we might not have to worry much. The fact that colds, flus, and stomach bugs routinely reinfect hasn't shredded the social fabric. "For large portions of the population, this is an inconvenience," Paul Thomas, an immunologist at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, in Tennessee, told me. Perhaps, as several experts have posited since the pandemic's early days, SARS-CoV-2 will just become the 5th cold-causing coronavirus.

Or maybe not. This virus seems capable of tangling into just about every tissue in the body, affecting organs such as the heart, brain, liver, kidneys, and gut; it has already claimed the lives of millions, while saddling countless others with symptoms that can linger for months or years. Experts think the typical SARS-CoV-2 infection is likely to get less dangerous, as population immunity builds and broadens. But considering our current baseline, "less dangerous" could still be terrible -- and it's not clear exactly where we're headed. When it comes to reinfection, we "just don't know enough," says Emily Landon, an infectious-disease physician at the University of Chicago.

For now, every infection, and every subsequent reinfection, remains a toss of the dice. "Really, it's a gamble," says Ziyad Al-Aly, a clinical epidemiologist and long-COVID researcher at Washington University in St. Louis. Vaccination and infection-induced immunity may load the dice against landing on severe disease, but that danger will never go away completely, and scientists don't yet know what happens to people who contract "mild" COVID over and over again. Bouts of illness may well be tempered over time, but multiple exposures could still re-up some of the same risks as before -- or even synergize to exact a cumulative toll.

"Will reinfection be really bad, or not a big deal? I think you could fall down on either side," says Vineet Menachery, a coronavirologist at the University of Texas Medical Branch. "There's still a lot of gray."

The majority of infections we witnessed in the pandemic's early chapters were, of course, first ones. The virus was hitting a brand-new species, which had few defenses to block it. But people have been racking up vaccine doses and infections for years now; immunity is growing on a population scale. Most of us are "no longer starting from scratch," says Talia Swartz, an infectious-disease physician, virologist, and immunologist at Mount Sinai's Icahn School of Medicine. Bodies, wised up to the virus's quirks, can now react more quickly, clobbering it with sharper and speedier strikes.

Future versions of SARS-CoV-2 could continue to shape-shift out of existing antibodies' reach, as coronaviruses often do. But the body is flush with other fighters that are much tougher to bamboozle -- among them, B cells and T cells that can quash a growing infection before it spirals out of control. Those protections tend to build iteratively, as people see pathogens or vaccines more often. People vaccinated 3 times over, for instance, seem especially well equipped to duke it out with all sorts of SARS-CoV-2 variants, including omicron and its offshoots.

Gordon, who is tracking large groups of people to study the risk of reinfection, is already starting to document promising patterns: 2nd infections and post-vaccination infections "are significantly less severe," she told me, sometimes to the point where people don't notice them at all. A 3rd or 4th bout might be more muted still; the burden of individual diseases may be headed toward an asymptote of mildness that holds for many years. Gordon and Swartz are both hopeful that the slow accumulation of immunity will also slash people's chances of developing long COVID. An initial round of vaccine doses seems to at least modestly trim the likelihood of coming down with the condition, and the risk may dwindle further as defenses continue to amass. ("We do need more data on that," Gordon said.)

Immunity, though, is neither binary nor permanent. Even if SARS-CoV-2's assaults are blunted over time, there are no guarantees about the degree to which that happens, or how long it lasts. Maybe most future tussles with COVID will feel like nothing more than a shrimpy common cold. Or maybe they'll end up like brutal flus. Wherever the average COVID case of the future lands, no 2 people's experience of reinfection will be the same. Some may end up never getting sick again, at least not noticeably; others might find themselves falling ill much more frequently. A slew of factors could end up weighting the dice toward severe disease -- among them, a person's genetics, age, underlying medical conditions, health-care access, and frequency or magnitude of exposure to the virus. COVID redux could pose an especially big threat to people who are immunocompromised. And for everyone else, no amount of viral dampening can totally eliminate the chance, however small it may be, of getting very sick.

Long COVID, too, might remain a possibility with every discrete bout of illness. Or maybe the effects of a slow-but-steady trickle of minor, fast-resolving infections would sum together, and bring about the condition. Every time the body's defenses are engaged, it "takes a lot of energy, and causes tissue damage," Thomas told me. Should that become a near-constant barrage, "that's probably not great for you." But Swartz said she worries far more about that happening with viruses that chronically infect people, such as HIV. Bodies are resilient, especially when they're offered time to rest, and she doubts that reinfection with a typically ephemeral virus such as SARS-CoV-2 would cause mounting damage. "The cumulative effect is more likely to be protective than detrimental," she said, because of the immunity that's laid down each time.

Al-Aly sees cause for worry either way. He is now running studies to track the long-term consequences of repeat encounters with the virus, and although the data are still emerging, he thinks that people who have caught the virus twice or thrice may be more likely to become long-haulers than those who have had it just once.

There's still a lot about SARS-CoV-2, and the body's response to it, that researchers don't fully understand. Some other microbes, when they reinvade us, can fire up the immune system in unhelpful ways, driving bad bouts of inflammation that burn through the body, or duping certain defensive molecules into aiding, rather than blocking, the virus's siege. Researchers don't think SARS-CoV-2 will do the same. But this pathogen is "much more formidable than even someone working on coronaviruses would have expected," Menachery told me. It could still reveal some new, insidious qualities down the line.

Studying reinfection isn't easy: To home in on the phenomenon and its consequences, scientists have to monitor large groups of people over long periods of time, trying to catch as many viral invasions as possible, including asymptomatic ones that might not be picked up without very frequent testing. Seasonal encounters with pathogens other than SARS-CoV-2 don't often worry us -- but perhaps that's because we're still working to understand their toll. "Have we been underestimating long-term consequences from other repeat infections?" Thomas said. "The answer is probably, almost certainly, yes."

... the rhythm of reinfection isn't just about the durability of immunity or the pace of viral evolution. It's also about our actions and policies, and whether they allow the pathogen to transmit and evolve. Strategies to avoid infection -- to make it as infrequent as possible, for as many people as possible -- remain options, in the form of vaccination, masking, ventilation, paid sick leave, and more. "There are still very good reasons" to keep exposures few and far between, Landon, of the University of Chicago, told me. Putting off reinfection creates fewer opportunities for harm: The dice are less likely to land on severe disease (or chronic illness) when they're rolled less often overall. It also buys us time to enhance our understanding of the virus, and improve our tools to fight it. "The more we know about COVID when we get COVID," the better off we'll be, she said.

SARS-CoV-2 may yet become another common-cold coronavirus, no more likely to screw with its hosts the 5th time it infects them than the first. But that's no guarantee. The outlooks of the experts I spoke with spanned the range from optimism to pessimism, though all agreed that uncertainty loomed. Until we know more, none were keen to gamble with the virus -- or with their own health. Any reinfection will likely still pose a threat, "even if it's not the worst-case scenario," Abdool Karim told me. "I wouldn't want to put myself in that position."

[3] Long COVID
Date: Tue 24 May 2022

Brain fog, other long COVID symptoms can last more than a year, study finds
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The devastating neurological effects of long COVID can persist for more than a year, research published Tuesday [24 May 2022] finds -- even as other symptoms abate.

The study, published in the journal Annals of Clinical and Translational Neurology, is the longest follow-up study of the neurological symptoms among long COVID patients who were never hospitalized for COVID [Ali, S.T., Kang, A.K., Patel, T.R., Clark, J.R., Perez-Giraldo, G.S., Orban, Z.S., Lim, P.H., Jimenez, M., Graham, E.L., Batra, A., Liotta, E.M. and Koralnik, I.J. (2022), Evolution of neurologic symptoms in non-hospitalized COVID-19 "long haulers". Ann Clin Transl Neurol. https://doi.org/10.1002/acn3.51570]. The neurological symptoms -- which include brain fog, numbness, tingling, headache, dizziness, blurred vision, tinnitus and fatigue -- are the most frequently reported for the illness.

The new study, from researchers at Northwestern University, is a follow-up to a shorter-term study published last spring [2022] that focused on 100 patients with long COVID. That research found that 85% of the patients reported at least 4 lasting neurological problems at least 6 weeks after their acute infections.

For the follow-up, the team continued to survey 52 of the original participants, who were patients at the university's Neuro COVID-19 Clinic -- a long COVID clinic -- for up to 18 months. The cohort was 3/4 female, and the average age was 43. Almost 80% were vaccinated, and all had mild COVID symptoms that did not require hospitalization.

Most neurological symptoms persisted after an average of 15 months, the study found. While most patients did report improvements in their cognitive function and fatigue, the symptoms had not gone away completely and still affected their quality of life.

"A lot of those patients still have difficulties with their cognition that prevent them from working like they used to," said a study co-leader, Dr. Igor Koralnik, the chief of neuro-infectious diseases and global neurology at Northwestern Medicine, who oversees the Neuro COVID-19 Clinic.

The study also found that some symptoms, including heart rate and blood pressure variation, as well as gastrointestinal problems, increased over time, while loss of taste and smell tended to improve. COVID vaccination did not alleviate symptoms, but it also did not make long COVID any worse.

The Northwestern study did not look at why some of the symptoms persist and others fade away or why they occur in the first place.

"The next step for this is finding out what causes long COVID in the first place and why some people get it and others don't," Koralnik said.

Dr. Avindra Nath, the clinical director of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke at the National Institutes of Health, who was not involved with the new research, said one hypothesis is that the symptoms in long COVID patients are the result of damage from the body's inflammatory response to the coronavirus. Any viral infection activates inflammatory cells throughout the body, including in the brain. The inflammation is meant to attack the invading virus, but it also damages brain cells and neurons in the process. SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID, triggers a particularly strong inflammatory response, he said.

"COVID is probably the most severe respiratory illness we have ever had, so it's no surprise that we are seeing long-term effects from it," Nath said.

Dr. Panagis Galiatsatos, an assistant professor of medicine and a pulmonary and critical care doctor at Johns Hopkins Medicine in Baltimore, who was not involved with the study, said continuing to track lasting symptoms is crucial to help experts separate long COVID symptoms from those of the natural healing process. That, he said, will inform further research that will explore treatment and, hopefully, ways to provide an early diagnosis.

Galiatsatos said it is normal for a patient to experience fatigue and other symptoms during the normal recovery process after an infection, because fighting off a virus is hard on the body. "But healing shouldn't last 6 months or more," he said.

"Right now we need time to distinguish between the 2 groups," he said. "Patients have to just wait, and that's really frustrating. But if we had biomarkers to test, we could identify long COVID and intervene early."

The search for biomarkers, however, has yielded no results so far.

In a separate study, published Monday [23 May 2022] in the Annals of Internal Medicine, researchers from another branch of the NIH -- the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases -- carried out comprehensive medical exams on 189 long COVID patients. [Michael C. Sneller, C. Jason Liang, Adriana R. Marques, et al. A Longitudinal Study of COVID-19 Sequelae and Immunity: Baseline Findings. Annals of Internal Medicine. https://doi.org/10.7326/M21-4905]

The exams included more than 130 diagnostic cognitive, blood and imaging tests. They also looked for biomarkers that would signal heart damage and brain damage, as well as kidney and liver injury.

The results were compared to the same exams carried out in 120 people without long COVID; no differences were identified.

"Despite a thorough investigation," said the lead study author, Dr. Michael Sneller, an infectious disease specialist at the NIH, "we could not demonstrate any evidence of organ damage" or other physical differences.

That should not be interpreted to mean long COVID patients are not experiencing true illness, Sneller said. Something is occurring; modern medicine simply has been unable so far to figure out what is going on.

"Make no mistake, these people are really suffering," he said. "We're not giving up."

Vaccines may not prevent many symptoms of long COVID, study suggests
--------------------------------------------------------------------
A large U.S. study looking at whether vaccination protects against long COVID showed the shots have only a slight protective effect [15%]: Being vaccinated appeared to reduce the risk of lung and blood clot disorders, but did little to protect against most other symptoms.

The new paper, published 25 May 2022 in Nature Medicine, is part of a series of studies by the Department of Veterans Affairs on the impact of the coronavirus, and was based on 33 940 people who experienced breakthrough infections after vaccination.

[In the past 24 hours, 11 countries: USA (129 092), Taiwan (94 796), North Korea (88 530), Japan (59 877), Spain (45 919), Brazil (40 633), Australia (34 376), Italy (21 820), Germany (14 483), South Korea (14 382), and Cyprus (12 252) reported the highest numbers of cases, all reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases. A global total of 1908 deaths were reported in the preceding 24 hours (late 25 May 2022 to late 26 May 2022).

A total of 27 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 10 of the 27 countries are from the European region, 6 are from the Americas region, 0 from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 8 are from the Western Pacific region, 2 from the South East Asia region, and 1 from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased by 23.5%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 10.8%. Comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 6.3% increase in daily reported cases and an 8.7% increase in reported deaths. This shows an overall global trend of increasing cases and deaths.

Impression: The global daily reported over 0.63 million newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours with over 530.94 million cumulative reported cases and more than 6.30 million reported deaths. - Mod.UBA]
