Nearly 1000 dogs may have already died from an exotic tick-borne disease rapidly spreading through remote indigenous communities, according to a Top End vet.

Ehrlichiosis was believed not to exist in Australia until it was confirmed in WA's Kimberley region in May 2020 and the Northern Territory in June 2020.

The bacterial disease causes fever, lethargy, enlarged lymph nodes, under-skin bleeding, weight loss, and can lead to death in dogs.

Bonny Cumming, a vet with Animal Management in Rural and Remote Indigenous Communities (AMRRIC) working across the Top End, said it was hard to gauge how many dogs had died from ehrlichiosis. However, she expected that by the end of the 2020-21 wet season, dog deaths would "be in the thousands."

"What we are seeing is in some regions [ehrlichiosis] is really exploding," Dr Cumming said. "It has a pretty high mortality rate, especially for younger or older dogs that are immune-compromised. It is really heavily impacting those dogs.

The NT's chief veterinary officer, Sue Fitzpatrick, said ehrlichiosis was now in most local government areas, including Darwin, Palmerston, the Darwin rural area, Katherine and many remote communities.

Dr Fitzpatrick could not confirm how many dogs may have died but said more than 500 dogs from across the NT had been tested to date, with approximately half of the dogs showing signs testing positive for ehrlichiosis.

"Owners of infected dogs are being asked to ensure the dog is treated, on effective tick control, and to restrict the movement of the dog to reduce the risk of the spread of the disease," she said. "If people suspect their dog is showing signs of the disease, contact your local vet to arrange an appointment."

In Western Australia, the Kimberley has been hardest hit by the disease, and small numbers of cases have been traced to the Pilbara, Gascoyne, and northern Goldfields regions.

WA chief veterinary officer Michelle Rodan said ehrlichiosis was considered endemic in the Kimberley.

"We tested around 400 dogs [in the Kimberley], and around 50 per cent were positive," she said. "What we've found is rapid treatment with antibiotics has given the best resolution, but in the more severe cases, we're getting in the order of 8 to 10 per cent of those dogs dying as a result of it."

Dr Rodan said historical testing had not found the disease in wild dog populations in WA, but the high numbers of strays in the region could pose a challenge to controlling the spread of the disease.

Travellers leaving the Kimberley and heading south are also reminded of the dog movement conditions in place to reduce the spread of ehrlichiosis to southern areas of WA.

Dr Cumming said treating the disease in remote indigenous communities was very challenging, especially during the wet season when a single female tick could lay up to 3000 eggs.

"While [ehrlichiosis] can be treated, it is difficult to treat and requires a long course of antibiotics, which makes it really quite challenging in remote communities having only veterinary access twice a year," she said.

"One of the things that AMRRIC has been advocating for is for community stores stocking appropriate animal health products that include tick preventatives. Another aspect is looking at environmental tick control because in some regions over the wet season, we can literally see ticks crawling up the walls in their thousands. So when you've got those sorts of conditions, it's really important there's a coordinated effort to control those ticks."

Key points:
- Ehrlichiosis is a tick-borne disease that occurs in tropical and sub-tropical regions worldwide;
- The NT's chief veterinary officer, Sue Fitzpatrick, says ehrlichiosis is now in most local government areas;
- AMRRIC vet Bonny Cumming says a single female tick can lay up to 3000 eggs;
- Ehrlichiosis was believed not to exist in Australia until it was confirmed in WA.

["Canine ehrlichiosis is a worldwide tick-borne disease caused by _Ehrlichia_ species, which are rickettsial organisms infecting mononuclear, granulocytic, or thrombocytic cells. The most common causative agent is _Ehrlichia canis_, but other _Ehrlichia_ species can also produce the disease. Clinical and subclinical infections are common in dogs.

The typical presentation is characterized by depression, lethargy, mild weight loss, and anorexia, with or without hemorrhagic tendencies. If present, bleeding usually is manifested by dermal petechiae, ecchymoses, or both. Hemorrhagic diathesis, such as epistaxis, may occur. Other signs may include lymphadenomegaly, splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, and, less frequently, anterior or posterior uveitis, polymyositis, polyarthritis, and central nervous system (CNS) signs (e.g., seizures, ataxia, vestibular deficits, cerebellar dysfunction).

Differentials include Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF) and other causes of thrombocytopenia, vasculitis, immune-mediated disorders, and cutaneous drug reactions.

Diagnosis
------
- Hemogram: normochromic, normocytic nonregenerative anemia, thrombocytopenia, or of serum anti-_Ehrlichia_ antibodies. If initial test results are negative, one should consider repeating the assay 2 to 3 weeks later because false-negative results can occur in acutely ill dogs. Likewise, false-positive results (indicating exposure rather than infection) may occur, especially in healthy dogs in endemic areas.

- PCR technique (blood, bone marrow aspirate, splenic aspirate): detection of _Ehrlichia leukopenia is common.

- Indirect immunofluorescent antibody test or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay: detection antigen.

Treatment and Prognosis
------
- Supportive care (e.g., fluids, blood transfusions) should be provided, if needed.

- The treatment of choice is doxycycline 10 mg/kg PO every 12 hours for 28 days.

- Alternative treatments include the following:
- Tetracycline 22 mg/kg PO q 8 hours for 14 to 21 days
- Chloramphenicol (i.e., for puppies under 6 months old) 15-25 mg/kg PO, SC, or IV q 8 hours for 14 to 21 days
- Midocarb dipropionate 5 mg/kg IM twice, 2 to 3 weeks apart

- Clinical improvement should be seen 24 to 48 hours after treatment is initiated. Platelet counts should also begin to increase during this time, usually returning to normal within 14 days.

- A strict tick control program should be instituted for dogs and premises.

- In endemic areas, long-term doxycycline 3 mg/kg PO every 24 hours has been used prophylactically to prevent reinfection.

- The prognosis is good if treatment is initiated early in the course of the disease. The prognosis is poor for dogs with chronic or severe disease. Infected dogs are not directly contagious to humans or to other dogs (except via blood transfusions), but their infection can be indirectly transmitted via tick vectors."

We extend our sympathies to the owners of the animals and to the veterinary staff and caregivers. In an epidemic, situation this is very difficult. - Mod.TG
