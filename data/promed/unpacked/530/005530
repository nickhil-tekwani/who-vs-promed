Three Queensland holidaymakers face an anguished wait for medical
results after being bitten by a fruit bat sent mad by the deadly
lyssavirus [that is, a member of the virus species _Australian bat
lyssavirus_]. The unlucky men were attacked separately by the same
infected little red flying fox while sightseeing near Town of 1770 on
the state's central coast on Tuesday [5 Jan 2010]. The animal was
caught and killed by one of them.

Laboratory tests yesterday [6 Jan 2010] confirmed that it had been
carrying lyssavirus. The only 2 known human cases of the Australian
strain of the bat-borne disease resulted in the deaths of both
victims in 1996 and 1998 respectively, also in Queensland.

Doctors say prompt treatment with the rabies vaccine, which the men
will now receive, has since proved totally effective. The [bat
lyssavirus] is closely related to the rabies virus, and [infection]
is fatal if untreated. The bat lyssavirus was identified only after
the death 13 years ago of a 39-year-old Rockhampton woman, an animal
lover who had become a volunteer carer for flying foxes. The 2nd
known victim of Australian bat lyssavirus [infection] died in 1998.
She had reportedly been bitten while protecting a child from an
attacking bat at a party in Mackay, in Queensland's north.

None of the 3 men attacked on Tuesday [5 Jan 2010] knew the others
before the infected bat swooped. They had been walking on a boardwalk
through the popular Joseph Banks Conservation Park near Town of 1770,
500 km [310 mi] north of Brisbane. The flying fox was seen to be
"displaying unusual behaviour" in a tree about 10 m [33 ft] off the
path. It launched itself at the men and, in repeated attacks, bit
them variously on the head, ears, and fingers. The 3rd man to be
struck caught and killed the animal, before handing it over to
concerned park rangers, who had it tested for lyssavirus. The results
came back yesterday [6 Jan 2010], confirming fears that the bat's
aggressive behaviour had been caused by the rabies-related virus.

Acting Queensland chief health officer Christine Selvey said there
was still a risk the men could be infected. "However, we have a very,
very highly effective prevention regime and these people will be
getting that as soon as can be arranged," Dr Selvey said. They had
returned to their homes in Ipswich, west of Brisbane; Hervey Bay,
north of the capital; and Agnes Waters, in central Queensland.

Queensland Health logged 77 reports of people being bitten or
scratched by flying foxes or bats last year [2009], most of whom
received successful prophylactic treatment for lyssavirus. Of the 28
animals caught and tested, 5 had lyssavirus. Up to a sixth of bats
and flying foxes in Queensland are thought to be infected.
Biosecurity Queensland principal veterinary scientist Janine Barrett
said the behaviour of the infected bat on Tuesday [5 Jan 2010] was
characteristic of lyssavirus. "It is highly unusual for bats to
approach people," she said. "It is also unusual that it was out at
the day time away from a roosting site."

While the rabies vaccine works against lyssavirus, it has no effect
on another deadly bat-borne disease, Hendra virus, which has killed 4
of the 7 people known to have contracted it in Queensland.

The virus genus _Lyssavirus_ (Greek: 'lyssa' - rabies) comprises at
least 7 distinct virus species, and bats are the vectors of at least
6 of the 7 species. Different virus species are carried by different
species of bats. All the bat lyssaviruses show some degree of
antigenic cross-reactivity, hence the standard human rabies virus
vaccine will provides complete protection if administered promptly
after exposure to infection. It is likely that the 3 holidaymakers
from Brisbane will survive their encounter with a rabid red flying
fox unscathed due to the prompt action of Queensland Health.
