With avian flu spreading, U.S. to expand its testing
-----------------------------------------------
The U.S. government, bracing for the possibility that migrating birds
could carry a deadly strain of bird flu to North America, plans to
test nearly 8 times as many wild birds this year [2006] as have been
tested in the past decade. Starting in April 2006, samples from 75
000 to 100 000 birds will be tested for the virus, mainly in Alaska,
as part of a joint effort of the departments of Agriculture and
Interior, along with state Fish & Wildlife agencies. That's a jump
from the 12 000 birds tested since 1996, the USDA's Angela Harless
says. [Related item: Graphic - Migratory path of birds:

The expanded program, which will include birds in the Pacific islands
and on the West Coast, reflects growing concern that the virus,
highly pathogenic A (H5N1), which has spread across Asia and Europe,
could arrive in North America as soon as this spring [2006] and be
carried into the western continental USA by fall.
"I would expect the virus to arrive in North America," USDA Secretary
Mike Johanns says. It could enter in other ways, he says, including
smuggling of infected pet birds or fighting cocks, but the chance
that it could be carried in with the spring migration "is definitely
a possibility." If tests find the virus in birds in North America, it
would not signal the start of a human pandemic, because it still
primarily is a disease of birds, he says.
Of 4 major bird migratory patterns, or flyways, in North America --
the Pacific, Central, Mississippi and Atlantic -- the Pacific flyway
is of greatest interest now, says Frank Quimby of the U.S. Department
of the Interior. "The Pacific flyway is the most likely route,
because birds that winter in Asia migrate in spring to Alaska."
Alaska, with its wetlands and coastal areas, is a kind of Grand
Central Station for bird species.
"Alaska is the crossroad of bird migration pathways," says Rick
Kearney, wildlife program coordinator for the U.S. Geological Survey.
"With the coming of the spring migration season, we are increasing
surveillance" in partnership with federal, state and local agencies.
"We shall be collecting samples from live migratory birds and samples
from hunters."
Birds on the Asian flyway could arrive in Alaska in April and May
2006, says Nicholas Throckmorton of the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service.
"That could be the moment when wild birds bring Asian bird flu to
Alaska. As those birds spend the summer breeding in Alaska, they
could pass it to birds that migrate south in the fall," he says. He
added that if the virus arrives in Alaska, the agency doesn't expect
it to move south until sometime between August and November 2006.
To test the birds, scientists capture them in nets, take swabs from
the throat or cloaca (posterior opening) and send the samples to the
U.S. Geological Survey's National Wildlife Center in Madison,
Wisconsin. If any test positive for H5N1, confirmatory testing will
be done at the USDA's National Veterinary Services Laboratories in
Ames, Iowa. USDA spokeswoman Angela Harless says as many as 18 000
samples a day can be tested. Tests also will be made on birds killed
by hunters in Alaska this spring 2006, and in Oregon, Washington and
California during the fall, Throckmorton says.
To bird experts, avian flu is nothing new. There are at least 144
types of bird flu viruses, most of which don't kill the birds. Only 2
types, H7 and H5, have become highly pathogenic, killing 3 out of 5
chickens infected, Throckmorton says. In Asia, the H5N1 virus "went
from wild birds to domestic poultry, evolved in poultry and
re-infected wild birds," he says. Now more lethal than it was, it
kills some wild birds, but not all. "It's proven wild birds can carry
this virus and not have illness."
If the virus is detected in wild birds in North America, there will
be no massive killing of them to contain it, because experts,
including those from the World Health Organization, the World
Organisation for Animal Health and the USDA, agree that destroying
birds is not an effective control method. What would happen, Kearney
says, is health experts and people involved in agriculture would be
put on alert and warned to make sure poultry are separated from wild
birds.
Some scientists say the focus on wild birds is misplaced. "Migratory
birds are probably the least likely way avian flu is going to enter
the Western hemisphere," says Peter Marra, a bird ecologist at the
Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. The more likely route
into the USA, he says, is through the pet trade and the movement of
poultry, legally or illegally. "Migratory birds are innocent
bystanders," Marra says. "I don't doubt (they're) moving the virus. I
just don't think they're the primary movers."
The USDA has banned importation of live birds or bird products from
countries where the virus has spread. Birds that are legally brought
into the country are tested for H5N1 and other bugs, and they're held
in quarantine for 30 days. But experts warn that illegal trade in
birds and the smuggling of wild birds or fighting cocks could provide
an entry.
Richard Lobb of the National Chicken Council says poultry farmers
have been warned that "if you have hired help, make sure they don't
have fighting birds at home. That is the only way it would get into
commercial poultry."
