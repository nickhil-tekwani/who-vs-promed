At the indigenous community of Galte-Laime, Guamote county, province of
Chimborazo, 3,200 meters over sea level, there have been 12 deaths, between
February 8 through March 8. Eleven of them, were different members of a
family. Only one, was of [another family.
I had received a report on March 10 at the National Branch of Epidemiology
sent by the local epidemiologist. The data were confused, but the most
important common symptoms, referred by the relatives to the local
physicians were: fever of sharp onset (39.5 - 40 centigrade degrees),
cefalalgia, muscular pain, throat pain, cough. The evolution, were into a
period of 48 to 72 hours, with hemoptoic cough and the death.
Dr. Jean Marc Gabastout, microbiologist of the Pan American Health
Organization - PAHO in Ecuador and I, went to the geographical area, on
March 12 and 13th. We examined three patients, one of them with similar
symptoms, and the other two with "gripe" ; we took blood samples of them,
that [subsequently were sent to the CDC in the United States.
On February 8, a young woman ,13 years old, had died (index case or first
death) with the symptoms referred. That night at her funeral, seventy
persons had congregated in the same room. Ten of them died in the next 30
days, with intervals of 4 to 5 days. 10 "cuyes", (_Didelphus marsupialis_,
opossum) died 15 days before the first [?human death; three dogs and many
lambs were sickened too.
[The last previous known case of bubonic plague was 13 years ago in NIZAG,
40 Kms, to the south, far from there. Between other possibilities, we have
thought of pneumonic pestis, by the epidemiological antecedents, symptoms
and the epidemiological data obtained with the interviews to the actual
population that are living in the same zone.
On April 13, Dr. Ned Hayes of CDC from Fort Collins, Colorado, U.S.A., told
me by telephone, that one of the blood samples sent him, had a positive
result for serology of _Yersinia pestis_ of 1:64; the owner of this sample
is a brother of the index case. We have concluded that the possible
aetiology of these deaths could be pneumonic pestis. Actually, we are
working, in the development of a special local surveillance system,
contacts control; and implementation of a laboratory for diagnosis of pestis.
