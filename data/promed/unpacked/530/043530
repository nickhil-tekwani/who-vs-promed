Lumpy skin disease (LSD) is now rampant in Tboung Khmum with hundreds of cattle suffering from it in the province. Ken Chansocheat, a provincial veterinary department deputy director, said today [6 Aug 2021] that as of now at least 600 cows have been infected with the disease, mostly in Krouch Chhmar and Tboung Khmum districts especially along the Mekong River.

He said that LSD is transmitted by mosquitoes and other insects and there is no cure. Only antibiotics are given to help the cattle fight infection while treatment is continued according to the stage of the disease. Chansocheat said LSD had entered Thailand and continues to spread throughout Cambodia. So far, Tboung Khmum is the 18th province that has been hit, causing great concern to people who raise cattle. He added that the provincial veterinary officers are now vaccinating sick cows [see comment] in affected districts.

[During the 'LSD Coordination (zoom) Meeting for South East Asia' held by OIE's Sub-Regional Representation for South East Asia, Cambodia's presentation said that 2 provinces, namely Oddor Meanchey and Preah Vihear, were experiencing spread of the LSD virus as of 1 Jun 2021 (https://rr-asia.oie.int/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/01_cambodia_tum.pdf). The spread of LSD in about 2 months into 16 additional provinces out of Cambodia's total of 25, as indicated in the media report above, is striking.

Preventive vaccination of sick cows is useless. Furthermore, in the case of an LSD-infected herd, repeated use of the injector's needles has been shown to potentially spread the virus to uninfected animals. Has "sick" been erroneously added by the Khmer Times?

Generally: in case LSD mass vaccination is applied during the disease season, special attention should be paid to avoid the spread of the virus between animals and between farms through the frequent change of the syringe needles. - Mod.AS
