NEWS

Congolese case confirmed with the EVD registered in Uganda deceased this Fri 30 Aug 2019.
- The confirmed case in the city of Kasese in Uganda died on Fri 30 Aug 2019 at the transit center (CT) in Uganda;
- This is a 9-year-old girl residing in the Lubiriha Health Area (Majengo) located in Mutwanga Health Zone in North Kivu Province, Democratic Republic of Congo;
- She was co-patient of a deceased case and confirmed on 16 Aug 2019 at Umoja health post, during the period from 10-16 Aug 2019, who refused to be followed or to be vaccinated;
- This child was brought to Uganda by her mother on 28 Aug 2019 after reoccurrence of fever associated with asthenia and diarrhea, while from the 24th to the 27th of the same month, she was seen as an outpatient at the Sinai Pamusi clinic with a slight improvement;
- Intercepted on 28 Aug 2019 at the Ugandan port of Mpodwe, the child was transported to the Ugandan Transit Center in Kasese, where a sample was taken on 29 Aug 2019 with confirmation of EVD.
- The information did not reach the Congolese response teams until the day of Thu 29 Aug 2019. As soon as informed, the team of the general coordination to the response to EVD held a meeting of crisis at the end from which arrangements were made for its assumption of responsibility;
- This child died on 30 Aug 2019;
- In total, 50 contacts are listed in Lubiriha around this case, including 7 Frontline People (PPL). Investigations are in progress.

Two recommendations from the training of trainers on the preparation of the EVD response in the city of Kinshasa:
- 2 major recommendations were made during the training of trainers on the preparation for the Ebola virus disease (EVD) response in the city of Kinshasa. This is the training of health care providers and regular simulation exercises to prepare to intercept and quickly stop possible Ebola suspected cases that could occur in the city of Kinshasa, said the Deputy Director of the National Program Border Hygiene, Dr. Billy Yumayine.

- For the national coordinator of the preparation of the EVD response in the city of Kinshasa, Dr. Body Ilonga, after this training of national trainers, it would be necessary to support provinces, whose 1st 2 targeted are the Tshopo and Kinshasa. To this end, it has given 2 orientations for the implementation of the recommendations, namely: with regard to training, providers have already been targeted at entry points, and training will start next week with the support of JICA, IOM in collaboration with the city of Kinshasa Province. For simulation, there will be 2 scenarios at the airport upon arrival and/or boarding of passengers and at the community level.

- The Japan Agency for International Cooperation (JICA) Country Representative, Shibata Kazunao, welcomed this training, which not only increased the critical mass of actors in terms of rapid response teams, but also teams of trained trainers capable of sharing and enriching, on a large scale, the know-how and know-how characterizing the Congolese experience of Ebola virus disease.

- Long before, participants in this training were subjected to hand hygiene and waste management exercises, disinfection of means of transport, other soiled surfaces and standards for disinfection of aircraft. They have also been trained as to the correct and proper wearing of personal protective equipment (PPE);

- Communication on emergency risks and community engagement was also part of the lessons learned by these participants.

- It should be recalled that this training was organized as part of the WHO declaration on 17 Jul 2019 in Geneva of this 10th EVD epidemic in the DRC as a public health emergency of international concern.

Vaccination

- Since the beginning of vaccination on 8 Aug 2018, 208 321 people have been vaccinated.

- The only vaccine to be used in this outbreak is the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine, manufactured by the pharmaceutical group Merck, following approval by the Ethics Committee in its decision of 20 May 2018.

Monitoring at entry points

- Since the beginning of the epidemic, the cumulative number of travelers checked (temperature rise) at sanitary control points is 89 958 698.

- To date, a total of 98 entry points (PoE) and sanitary control points (PoCs) have been set up in the provinces of North Kivu and Ituri to protect the country's major cities and prevent the spread of the epidemic in neighboring countries.

Ebola virus disease - Democratic Republic of the Congo

The Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in North Kivu, South Kivu, and Ituri provinces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo continued this week with similar transmission intensity to the previous 6 weeks, with an average of 77 cases per week (Figure 1). In the past 21 days from 7 Aug through 27 Aug 2019, 66 health areas within 18 health zones reported new cases (Table 1, Figure 2). During this period, a total of 203 confirmed cases were reported, with the majority coming from the health zones of Beni (28%, n=57), Mandima (11%, n=22), and Kalunguta (11%, n=22). In addition, Mambasa continues to show signs of an emerging hotspot, with 16 reported cases in the past 21 days. The response continues to address these hotspots through early case detection and thorough investigation, strong contact identification and follow up, and engagement with the local communities.

Two additional cases have been reported in South Kivu's Mwenga Health Zone, bringing the total to 6 cases since 15 Aug 2019. These individuals are family members of one of the recent cases. Although this indicates 2 generations of local transmission within Mwenga, the new cases are individuals who were under surveillance, and they were able to quickly receive care when they became ill.

On 22 Aug 2019, Nyiragongo Health Zone (which includes suburbs of Goma city) passed 21 days without additional confirmed cases detected, and all contacts completed the 21-day follow-up period. Surveillance and response activities within Goma city and surrounding areas will continue, as risks of further introduction of EVD from active areas remain high.

As of 27 Aug 2019, a total of 2997 EVD cases were reported, including 2892 confirmed and 105 probable cases, of which 1998 cases died (overall case fatality ratio 67%). Of the total confirmed and probable cases, 58% (1740) were female, and 28% (842) were children aged less than 18 years. To date, 156 health workers have been infected.

Pillar 1 of the 4th Strategic Response Plan (SRP4) for the control of the EVD outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is available on the WHO website. Pillar 1 covers the core public health response to the outbreak. The current estimated funding requirement for all partners for the period July -- December 2019 is USD 287 million, including USD 120-140 million for WHO. As of 27 Aug 2019, USD 45.3 million have been received by WHO, with further funds committed or pledged. Current available funds will close the financing gap up until the end of September 2019. Further resources are needed to fund the response through to December 2019 and WHO is appealing to donors to provide generous support. A summary of funding received by WHO since the start of this outbreak can be found here.

Alarming number of Ebola deaths in DRC a rallying cry to scale up treatment

Since the Ebola epidemic struck in the northeast of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) 1 year ago, almost 600 of around 850 children who have caught the virus have now died, the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) reported on Fri 30 Aug 2019.

"The news that the total number of deaths has now passed 2000, out of more than 3000 cases, should act as a rallying cry for us all to step up our efforts to defeat this terrible disease and end this outbreak," the Agency's statement said.

"As the numbers continue to grow, it is vital to remember that each one of these cases is somebody's child, a son or daughter; a mother, father brother or sister," the announcement read. "Each of these deaths leaves a family not only in mourning but also scared and worried about their own exposure to the disease."

UNICEF noted recent breakthroughs in finding successful treatments highlight that "for the 1st time, we now have the means to both prevent and treat Ebola." Recent media reports show the disease is no longer incurable, with scientific advancements promising to tame outbreaks and boost survival rates.

Medical advances however, "mean little" if infection goes undetected, or "if individuals are too scared to seek treatment."

This Ebola epidemic, categorized by the World Health Organization (WHO) as an International Public Health Emergency in July 2019, has affected more children than in any other previous outbreak, and the virus "ravages children in ways that are very different from adults," UNICEF said.

As such, treatments for young persons are specialized. "UNICEF is working with partners to meet children's immediate and longer-terms needs, accompanying them and their families every step of the way," the agency said.

These efforts include risk communication and engagement, infection prevention and control, psychosocial support, deployments of child nutritionists and building protective school environments.

Ebola outbreaks are unique in the "exceptional level of investment" needed to combat them, UNICEF explained. "They require 100 per cent of cases to be treated, and 100 per cent of contacts to be traced and managed."

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres will travel to impacted areas on Sat 31 Aug 2019 in an expression of solidarity with victims and families fighting the epidemic.

DRC: Only 15% of Ebola funding available; Antonio Guterres launches alarm

Antonio Guterres, Secretary-General of the United Nations, visited the territory of Beni on Sun 1 Sep 2019. In particular, he raised the issue of financing the 4th Ebola response plan.

"We need greater solidarity from the international community. The pledges up to the end of the year [2019] correspond more or less to the need for Ebola control, but only 15% have been paid so far. There is a problem of liquidity," he told the microphone of Actualite.CD.

Since the beginning of the epidemic, the cumulative number of cases is 3023, of which 2918 were confirmed and 105 probable. In total, there were 2024 deaths (1919 confirmed and 105 probable) and 902 people healed.

"When there is no cash, even if there are promises, the response against Ebola stops. If you lose a week in the Ebola response, you can lose the war on Ebola. Ebola does not wait. All the countries and organizations that have made financial commitments must be able to fulfill their promises so that the vigorous response I have seen here can continue uninterrupted," he added.

He suggested that partners accelerate the pace of disbursement.

"Payments are still very limited. We cannot stop the response while waiting for the money," hammered the UN No. 1 again.

The World Bank announced on 23 Aug 2019 that USD 50 million will be donated to the World Health Organization (WHO) to "fund its operational activities to save lives in the context of frontline responses to the epidemic."

This funding is part of the USD 300 million financial package announced by the World Bank last month [August 2019] to support the 4th Ebola Strategic Response Plan (SRP4). The USD 300 million covers more than half of the needs of the SRP4.

Children on front line of fight to stop spread of Ebola

Before dawn, Congolese teenager Doneka Kabowo sets off for school in Uganda, negotiating miles of jungle, the threat of armed militias, and an international border to reach her classroom.

Every weekday morning, yet another obstacle stands in the way of 15-year-old Kabowo and hundreds of other boys and girls from the Democratic Republic of Congo on their way to school in Uganda. They must undergo daily health checks for Ebola.

"It's tiring, but we're getting used to it. It is to stop Ebola from crossing over," Samuel Baini, another 15-year-old student, told AFP after his health check at Mpondwe, the busiest crossing point between Uganda and the DR Congo.

An Ebola outbreak in DR Congo has killed more than 2000 people since last August, health officials said Fri 30 Aug 2019.

Ugandans, fearing the deadly virus could breach the porous border, are taking no chances.

A 9-year-old Congolese girl who tested positive for Ebola at Mpondwe died early on Fri 30 Aug 2019 morning, Yusuf Baseka, the health director in the southwestern Ugandan border district of Kasese, told AFP.

The girl is the 4th victim diagnosed with Ebola in Uganda to have died from the haemorrhagic fever.

In June 2019, 3 members of a single family tested positive for Ebola in Uganda after entering from DR Congo. Two died in Uganda, while the 3rd succumbed to the disease after returning to DR Congo.

Up to 18 000 people make the journey every day between eastern DR Congo -- the epicentre of the Ebola outbreak -- and Uganda, according to government figures.

All must be methodically screened at the border to ensure they are free of the virus. Temperatures are taken and hands disinfected. Anyone recording a fever is kept for additional checks.

Among the travellers between the neighbouring countries are thousands of school children making the journey alone.

Their parents send them from remote and poor villages thousands of miles from the DRC capital Kinshasa to Uganda, where job and educational opportunities are greater, and cultural and family ties strong.

The children can be seen running towards Mpondwe early every morning, some barefoot and in tattered uniforms as they join the rush.

Younger children are helped by older students to line up as health workers in gloves, face masks and goggles check temperatures and instruct them to lather hands with sterilising wash.

But it is not without inconvenience. "Sometimes we get to school late, because we have to be in line for checking, and it takes time," said Doreane Kambari, a 16-year-old attending high school in Bwera in Kasese.

Most of the children are already accustomed to the procedure. "The smell of the chemicals used in the water takes a long time to go away," she added, referring to the precautionary chlorine wash all travellers undergo when passing through Mpondwe.

However, children were also using unofficial routes into Uganda until warned of the consequences, said Rajab Kasero Bezza, director of studies at the government-run Nyabugando primary school.

"We told them unless they get checked for Ebola, they would lose their opportunity to get an education," he told AFP.

The World Health Organization (WHO) declared Uganda free of the disease in late July 2019, but the latest positive case underscores the challenge of containing the virus in DR Congo.

Ebola can take up to 3 weeks to incubate and cannot be spread until the infected person has symptoms, the WHO says. But it can be difficult to clinically tell Ebola from malaria, typhoid fever or meningitis.

Francis Tumwine, an International Committee of the Red Cross worker at Mpondwe, said creating public awareness of the disease was critically important to quashing the rumours around it.

"The fear of Congolese children bringing Ebola into schools was very real," he told AFP.

"But we taught people about the virus, and they now know what to do."

At Nyabugando school, where around 100 students come and go from Congo every day, teachers and health workers have been combating stigma around Ebola and educating the wider community about the realities of the disease.

Ugandan parents initially feared their children could catch the virus from Congolese playmates, not understanding how transmission occurred, Bezza said.

"In the beginning, there was a negative attitude towards children from DRC, but this has changed," said Bezza.

Doctor Baseka, the director of health services in Kasese, said the Congolese children had become ambassadors of change, helping quash myths about Ebola back in their home communities.

"People there thought Ebola was witchcraft. But now their children are learning from our Ebola awareness teams at school that the disease is real and deadly, a message they pass on to their parents," he told AFP. "We have seen behavioural change."

Summary box

- Health workers were differentially infected during the 2014-2016 Ebola outbreak with an incidence rate of 30-44/1000 depending on their job duties, compared to the wider population's rate of 1.4/1000, according to the WHO.

- Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) health workers had a much lower incidence rate of 4.3/1000, explained as the result of MSF's duty of care toward staff safety.

- Duty of care is defined as an obligation to conform to certain standards of conduct for the protection of others against an unreasonable risk of harm.

- The duty of care was operationalised through 4 actions: performing risk assessments prior to deployment, organising work and work practices to minimise exposure, providing extensive risk communication and training of staff and providing medical follow-up for staff exposures.

- Adopting and consistently enforcing these broader, duty of care safety policies in deployed teams augments and fortifies standard infection prevention practices, creating a more protective, comprehensive safety programme.

- Prioritising staff safety by taking such actions will help avoid the catastrophic loss of the health work force and assist in building resilient health systems.

[Byline: Eyder Peralta]

Why the Ebola Response Is A Success In Goma - But Not Elsewhere In Congo

Even at Sunday Mass, you cannot miss the signs of Ebola. Parishioners at St. Francis Xavier Catholic Church in Goma line up behind buckets to douse their hands with a solution of bleach and water. Then they get in another line where a team of health care workers check their temperature with an infrared thermometer.

The bells from the church tower toll. Girls run around in formal dresses. They flit around posters warning of Ebola symptoms as the health workers look out at them from behind protective goggles.

This scene was very different a few weeks ago, says Jean Roger Paluku Lula, the team leader from Congo's Health Ministry. People were angry. They did not want health workers in their community.

The Democratic Republic of Congo is as familiar as any place with handling outbreaks of Ebola. The virus was discovered here in 1976, and the country has controlled the previous 9 outbreaks without major problems. But the current outbreak -- the 10th in its history -- is now more than a year old and has killed 2000 people and has become the 2nd-biggest outbreak in history.

The outbreak started in a small town called Mangina but worked its way south through the densely populated towns of Beni and Butembo. Eventually, in July 2019, the virus made it to this sprawling city of 2 million. It's a transit hub with an international airport and is just across the border from Rwanda. When Ebola reached Goma, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern, and funds and resources poured into Eastern Congo.

People in Goma reacted as many people did up north. They threw rocks at health workers, suspicious that they were profiting off the response. In this neighborhood, they barricaded roads; they refused to wash their hands.

"At 1st, they believed the thermometers we were using were actually a tool that infects people with Ebola," Lula says.

But health workers did what they've done many times here in Congo: They went deep into the neighborhoods, explaining the disease and the treatments. They talked to leaders. They convinced more than 1000 people to take an experimental vaccine, and here, at least, people understood. And the outbreak was controlled.

Lula looks around with satisfaction. A family of 6 had been found to have high fevers. Just a week or 2 ago, this would have been a tense moment. The crowd, he says, would have likely rallied around the family, afraid that they would be taken to an Ebola treatment center. But the family listened to health authorities. They shared their travel history. It turned out they had been nowhere near an Ebola outbreak zone. They were sent home, and everyone else at church continued with their day. That's the way an Ebola response is supposed to work.

In a lot of ways, when this outbreak began, there was hope it could be quickly controlled. Unlike the 2013-2016 outbreak in West Africa, scientists had new tools: an experimental vaccine and 2 treatments that have been proven highly effective.

In fact, Congo's 9th outbreak was declared over just days before this one began. Authorities in Equateur province had successfully used this new vaccine to form a protective ring around active cases. In less than 3 months, the outbreak was contained, limited to 54 confirmed cases. But Natalie Roberts, operations manager for Doctors Without Borders, says the vaccines and treatments had worked in very different settings.

"This is not sort of dealing with it on paper," she said. "It's dealing with it in a very, very difficult context, the eastern Congo being a very, very complicated environment in which to work."

As soon as you leave Goma, for example, the infrastructure crumbles; the security situation deteriorates. And everything becomes harder: Moving around, keeping vaccines cold, tracking down who is at risk and vaccinating them.

In Goma, authorities say they have been able to work every day. They haven't been hampered by attacks on facilities or violent protests. In a lot of ways, that explains why they've been able to stop secondary infections in Goma. But in Beni and Butembo, the outbreak seems to have no end in sight.

Not only that, Roberts says, but those cities are in a part of Congo that experiences so much other suffering.

This year [2019], for example, more people have been killed by measles than Ebola. Since January 2019, the World Health Organization says more than 3000 people have died of measles; each year in Congo, malaria kills 48 000 people.

Roberts and her colleagues say in parts of Ituri province, where violence has displaced hundreds of thousands, some of the health centers they are building now have to have separate isolation units for Ebola and measles.

"This population and this context have 99 problems, and Ebola is just one of them," Roberts says.

Misinformation is driving DRC's Ebola outbreak - but the community is the key to beating it

Ebola in Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) has reached another tragic milestone this week, with more than 2000 deaths recorded. While there has been more heartening news recently thanks to a trial of new Ebola treatments, the outbreak is far from under control and is still the worst the country has ever seen.

I was in the Democratic Republic of Congo at the start of the Ebola outbreak. I'm not a doctor. My job was to collate and analyse data. It's not something that sounds obvious for an Ebola operation, but the Red Cross needed a way to measure and understand the progress of the operation and what was hampering it.

It was clear from an early stage that this outbreak would be challenging. Some communities didn't want us to change the traditional way they buried people despite the risks associated with handling the dead. There were various rumours and ideas about Ebola and how it was spread. Some people didn't believe the virus was real.

With the local volunteers, we set up a system to map rumours and feedback. So far, the Red Cross has collected over 33 000 pieces of community feedback. These range from questions about how Ebola is passed on, to theories about treatment, to outright denial the virus exists. By looking at the beliefs and feedback, volunteers can adjust the response. For example, a transparent body bag was developed to help counter rumours that the bags contained rubble instead of people. It's amazing to see how data collection can have a real impact in an emergency.

It was challenging carrying out such a tech-heavy role in this environment. We had to ship in extra IT kit from nearby cities and other countries. The internet was quite difficult at times. That was frustrating when you're trying to do mobile data gathering in real time. We had to build up the infrastructure from scratch.

Just over a year on, many of the challenges remain. There is no quick fix. Many people continue to believe the outbreak is fake. If you think about it, this isn't that surprising. If people turned up at your door in weird suits and told you there was a deadly virus, it would be strange in any country. But this region is complex. It's not like you can just check things with a reliable source of information. There is little technology in rural areas. You hear something from your neighbour and you believe it.

The Red Cross' safe and dignified burial teams play a hugely important role in this response. People continue to be infectious for as long as 7 days after death from Ebola. Victims need to be buried immediately and by people who are appropriately dressed and trained.

Yet doing so can inevitably interfere with traditional burial rituals at what is a very sensitive time for families and communities. Most times, our teams are accepted and can work with families so the burial goes ahead safely. Other times, they're refused access. In the worst cases, the refusal becomes violent. These volunteers, who carry out the riskiest work, have so far escaped infection from Ebola, but have been hospitalised due to attacks.

In the face of these extraordinarily difficult circumstances, we owe a huge debt of gratitude to the community-based volunteers on the front lines of this response. All the volunteers I met were very enthusiastic and dedicated. They came to work despite difficult circumstances. Sometimes there were shootings or attacks -- even in front of their homes -- and they'd still want to come into work.

These volunteers and the people of the DRC have suffered long enough. As this crisis passes yet another terrible landmark, we need to continue listening to what the community is thinking and feeling if we are going to succeed in eradicating this disease.

Uganda Returns 5 to DRC; All Had Contact With Ebola Victim

Uganda's Health Ministry on Fri 30 Aug 2019 evening repatriated 5 Congolese people who had contact with a 9-year-old girl with Ebola to the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

The girl, also of Congolese origin, traveled with her mother Wed 28 Aug 2019 from Goma in the DRC and entered Uganda through the Mpondwe border post for medical care.

She was subsequently isolated and transferred to the nearby Bwera hospital Ebola Treatment Unit, where a blood test confirmed Thu 29 Aug 2019 that she was positive for the Ebola virus.

Dr. Joyce Moriku Kaducu, Uganda's state minister for primary health care, said even though Bwera's Kasese district has the capacity to handle a disease outbreak, including an Ebola outbreak, it was too late to save the girl.

"Unfortunately, the girl passed on early in the morning today [30 Aug 2019]. Upon the request of the father, plans are underway to repatriate the body to DRC for safe and dignified burial," Kaducu said.

Since June 2019, Uganda has vaccinated 8000 health workers who have been in the proximity of infected patients. Kaducu said health workers observed the appropriate practices regarding infection, prevention and control while the girl was under treatment, but the Uganda surveillance teams listed 5 people who had come into contact with the girl. Three shared the Ebola treatment unit with the girl, while 2 were tending to the patients, including the girl's mother.

"All these 5 people, they are of Congolese origin. And they were transported in the same ambulance with the confirmed case from Mpondwe point of entry to Bwera hospital. Four of these contacts have been taken back to DRC for vaccination and for appropriate and effective follow-up," Kaducu said.

The 5th contact, the mother of the confirmed case, is scheduled to return to DRC for burial of her daughter.

While Uganda has managed to control Ebola from spreading beyond Kasese district, availability of the vaccine, manufactured by the U.S. firm Merck, is limited.

WHO Country Representative to Uganda Yonas Tegegn Woldemariam said that after the latest case, 300 doses were delivered to Kasese on Fri 30 Aug 2019.

"Currently, there is a shortage of the Merck vaccine globally," Woldemariam said. "So, we are using it with strict criteria of who is at risk so that we can protect those people. And, it is also a tool to interrupt if there's any sustained transmission in a population."

The Health Ministry has reassured the public that the current threat poses no major risks to the rest of the country. A rapid-response team has been dispatched to Kasese to support the district teams to continue with the various Ebola response activities, including case management, community engagement, contact tracing, psychosocial support, and vaccination.
