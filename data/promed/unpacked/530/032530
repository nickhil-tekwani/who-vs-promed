Bark canker affects apple trees in drought conditions
-----------------------------------------------------
The Hessian Minister of Agriculture Puttrich reported on the results
of a 3 year project on bark canker of apple at the Research Institute
Geisenheim (RIG).

The disease appears mainly in hot and dry years like 2003, says Peter
Braun, RIG. A normally harmless bark endophyte virtually explodes,
with drought being the main factor. The fungus is called _Diplodia
mutila_. This parasite infects weakened trees affected by drought
stress and can lead to their death.

Since there are no approved fungicides to combat the fungus, it is
recommended to improve plant vigour by watering and fertilisers. Dead
wood should be removed. For new plantings, location and varieties
should be carefully selected. Braun agrees with other scientists that
due to climate change bark canker will be a long term problem.

[2] Marssonina blotch - India (Himachal Pradesh)

Early leaf fall destroys apple crop
-----------------------------------
The unseasonal leaf and fruit fall are giving sleepless nights to
apple growers in Kullu. Suffering with the Marssonina disease, apple
trees are increasingly losing their leaves and fruits. Farmers said
frequent hailstorms destroyed apples everywhere in the state [Himachal
Pradesh]. Now, this dangerous disease is back to destroy the remaining
crop. It spreads quickly from one tree to another and to other
orchards.

A fruit grower said, "The view is same everywhere. At first leaves
turned yellow and then they started falling down fast. And now apples
too are falling rapidly." Another farmer said, "Insecticides and
pesticides have no effect on the disease. This diseases is affecting
the growth of the plant. It has stopped new bud and leaf formation and
is also affecting the quality of fruit."

According to scientists, Marssonina becomes more active during
monsoon and a predetermined spray schedule is the only way to control
this deadly disease.

[3] Scab disease - USA (Michigan, Indiana): new strains

Apple disease proving resistant to attack
-----------------------------------------
US orchard growers are discovering some commonly used fungicides are
no longer effective at controlling a damaging apple scourge. Janna
Beckerman, Purdue University, said extensive long-term use of 4
popular fungicides has led to apple scab resistances in apples in
Indiana and Michigan. Apple scab is highly destructive.

"But the most disturbing thing we found is that many of the samples
we tested were resistant to all 4 fungicides. This is full-blown
resistance. It can cause orchard failures," Beckerman said. "A grower,
depending on the amount of diversity in the orchard, could lose the
entire crop."

The only option is to use older fungicides that are tightly
regulated, require more frequent application, and are more expensive.
"It's going to change how growers manage their orchards," she said.
"The more susceptible apple cultivars, like McIntosh, will become more
chemically intensive to manage. Growers have few options as it is, and
this will limit their options even further."

[Bark canker
------------
Bark cankers on apple and other fruit trees can be caused by multiple
fungi. They result in an area of dead bark that may become
discoloured, sunken, cracked, or fall away altogether. Often the rest
of the branch beyond the canker dies or becomes much less productive
due to the restricted supply of nutrients and/or water. Some cankers
expand and may eventually kill the tree, others stay the same size but
release spores starting new cankers elsewhere. Damage in orchards may
include yield losses, death of individual trees, as well as the
possibility of related diseases on leaves, fruits, or shoots. Cankers
can spread rapidly in favourable conditions. Fungicides may reduce the
spread of cankers, but phytosanitary practices are essential for
disease management.

In Germany, unusual canker symptoms and a seriously increased
mortality in apple trees have caused major concern in the central
region in recent years. The problem appeared to be confined to the
large number of apple trees grown traditionally in pasture land and
meadows, which are an important source for local juice and cider
industries, while commercial orchards were not affected. In item 1
above, a pathogen previously only reported from warmer regions
(_Diplodia mutila_) has now been identified as the cause. Regular
fungicide treatments and phytosanitation are thought to have prevented
the spread of the emerging pathogen to commercial orchards.

Similarly, a northward spread in Germany of a related species, _D.
seriata_ causing black rot of apple (ProMED-mail post 20090914.3230)
has also been attributed to warming climate.

Marssonina
----------
Marssonina blotch (MB) of apple is caused by the fungus _Diplocarpon
mali_. It has been found in some countries in the Americas, Asia, and
Europe. Infections first appear on mature leaves. Symptoms include
spots on leaves and fruit as well as severe premature leaf fall. In
affected orchards, apples nearing maturity are often seen hanging from
defoliated branches. MB affects size, colour, and quality of fruit
making the produce unsaleable. It also reduces fruit set in the
following season.

The fungus is reported to survive between seasons in fallen leaf
litter, and spores are spread by mechanical means and wind. MB
development is favoured by humid conditions and multiple cycles of
infection may occur in one crop leading to severe epidemics. Disease
management includes phytosanitary measures, cultural techniques, and
fungicides.

Scab disease
------------
Apple scab (also called black spot) is caused by the fungus _Venturia
inaequalis_ and is considered the most economically important disease
of apples worldwide. Infected fruit is often unmarketable and losses
can be more than 70 percent. The pathogen infects only species of
_Malus_, while other fungi in the same genus are known to cause scab
diseases on different fruit crops. Symptoms may include dark leaf
spots, premature leaf fall, and fruit lesions. Early infections often
result in severely cracked and malformed fruit and are most damaging
since fruit becomes more resistant as it matures.

The fungus overwinters in infected leaves on the ground. Spores are
spread with infected plant material, by mechanical means, splashing
rain, and carried long distances in air currents. Disease management
is expensive requiring up to 12 fungicide sprays a year in areas where
scab has become established. Apple cultivars vary in their
susceptibility to scab. Resistant varieties are available, but few of
them are currently suitable for commercial production.
