Lethal bird flu strain makes first April appearance
---------------------------------------------------
A case of avian influenza at a farm in Gimje, North Jeolla Province was
caused by the deadly H5N1 strain, according to the Ministry of Food,
Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries.

It is the 1st time an infection of the highly pathogenic strain of bird flu
has been reported this late in the year here. So far in Korea, highly
pathogenic bird flu cases were only reported between November and February.
Authorities have linked the later outbreak to climate change.

The deadly H5N1 strain can affect humans and even kill them if they come in
contact with infected birds. Authorities will cull 308 000 chickens and
destroy eggs at 7 farms within 500 m (0.3 mi) from the infected farm. The
1st bird flu case was reported in Korea in 2003. No human victims have been
reported. Between 2003 and March this year [2008], 372 people were infected
and 235 died in China, Viet Nam, Indonesia, Cambodia, the Philippines, and
Thailand.

Bird flu ravages central Viet Nam province
------------------------------------------
An outbreak of bird flu is sweeping through the central province of Quang
Nam, felling fowls and forcing authorities to cull a further 26 660 birds.
They destroyed 7000 eggs and 1250 ducks Monday [31 Mar 2008] after finding
signs of the H5N1 virus that causes the disease.

Seven communes in 4 districts -- Nui Thanh, Thang Binh, Dai Loc, and Tien
Phuoc -- have been affected. Nguyen Ngoc Quang, vice chairman of the Quang
Nam People's Committee, instructed local authorities to focus on
disinfecting affected areas and containing the spread of the disease.

Until mid-March [2008] only Nui Thanh had reported outbreaks.
