Date of confirmation of event: 31 Mar 2007
Report date: 3 Apr 2007
Date submitted to OIE: 3 Apr 2007
Reason for notification: reoccurrence of a listed disease
Date of previous occurrence: 2002
Manifestation of disease: sub-clinical infection
Causal agent: low pathogenic avian influenza virus, serotype H5N2
Nature of diagnosis: laboratory (basic), laboratory (advanced)
Report pertains to: defined zone within the country
New outbreaks
Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak location: West Virginia (Pendleton county, Pendleton)
Total animals affected:
Species: birds
Susceptible: 25 600
Cases: ---
Deaths: 0
Destroyed: 25 600
Slaughtered: 0
Epidemiology
Source of infection: unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: the samples were collected from a
commercial turkey flock as part of routine, pre-slaughter
surveillance.
-There were no signs of illness or increased mortality in the flock.
-These turkeys were scheduled to be slaughtered the week of 3-5 April 2007.
-The virus isolated has been typed as an H5N2 subtype, and evidence
to date shows it to be a low pathogenic strain. Real-time PCR
(polymerase chain reaction) results pending.
-State animal health officials have quarantined the affected premises
(on 1 Apr 2007).
-Enhanced biosecurity measures have been implemented and include
movement control of vehicles, equipment and personnel, and
prohibiting all bird movement.
-Increased surveillance on all flocks within a 6-mile (about 10 km.)
radius will be conducted.
-Additional testing at National Veterinary Services Laboratories is
currently being conducted and results are pending.
The last occurrence of low pathogenic notifiable avian influenza in
this zone was in 2002. At that time, an H7N2 virus subtype was
detected.
Note by the OIE Animal Health Information Department: H5 and H7 avian
influenza in its low pathogenic form in poultry is a notifiable
disease as per Chapter 2.7.12. on avian influenza of the Terrestrial
Animal Health Code.

[The clinical observations are highly indicative of low
pathogenicity; final determination of the pathogenicity might be
obtained by virus sequencing.
According to OIE's notification of 11 Mar 2003, an outbreak of H7N2
was recorded in mid-January 2003, in 2 commercial table-egg layers
operations managed by the same enterprise in New London County, State
of Connecticut. The virus subtype was H7N2, determined to be of low
pathogenicity by virus sequencing (see archived 20030316.0652). -
