An outbreak of measles in 2 cities in Kazakhstan
------------------------------------------------
An outbreak of measles has been reported by the Infectious Diseases
Hospital in the city of Pavlodar. 6 of the patients are military men.
According to the head of the sanitary epidemiological service, Vladimir
Chuklinov, a young army officer arriving from Alma Ata (the capital of
Kazakhstan) was the index case. [The city of Alma Ata is now known as
Almaty, and the administrative capital of Kazakhstan is now Astana. -
Mod.CP] Health officials have instituted control measures to prevent spread
of infection. Military staff have all been vaccinated against measles, and
it is planned to vaccinate pregnant women. The last measles outbreak in
Pavlodar was recorded 17 years ago. 437 people were admitted to the
hospital at that time.
In an outbreak recorded in the city of Karagaanda in Kazakhstan, 14 people
contracted infection in the first 2 weeks of January 2005. The outbreak
started in December 2004 with 47 cases registered.
According to epidemiologists, this is [the most serious] outbreak for 10
years. 80 per cent of those diagnosed with measles are adults, mostly
students. According to a correspondent, 8 of the patients are surgeons from
the city hospital. According to epidemiologists, measles was imported from
other regions of Kazakhstan. Every person between the ages of 21 and 30 is
being revaccinated.

Kazakhstan: 420 cases of measles admitted to hospital in one week
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Zhanar Nurgozhina, a physician-epidemiologist of the Republic
Epidemiological Service has stated that 420 people with measles have been
treated in hospital in the course of a week in Kazakhstan, including 240 in
Almaty, the capital of the republic. [The administrative capital of
Kazakhstan is now the city of Astana in the north; Almaty is a commercial
centre in the south. - Mod.CP]. An unusual feature is that more than half
the patients are adults aged between 15 and 50, in whom the disease can be
more severe than in children. The increase in cases has been recorded in
Astana, eastern Kazakhstan, Karaganda and the Pavlodar regions of the
Republic. The Republic Epidemiological Service has been expecting outbreaks
of measles, which first appeared in the Republic in October 2004, and have
prepared adequate stocks of vaccine. Mass vaccination is being carried out
first at schools and other educational institutions.
