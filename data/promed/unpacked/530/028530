BLACK SPOT, CITRUS - SOUTH AFRICA: EU IMPORT RESTRICTIONS

The European Commission announced restrictions on citrus shipments from South Africa due to an outbreak of "black spot" disease there. Now, South African politicians are concerned about the economic ramifications for the world's largest citrus exporter, accounting for more than 25 percent of global trade.

The EU placed a similar ban on South African citrus in November 2013 [ProMED-mail post 20131204.2090761] because of high numbers of interceptions of infected citrus fruits. "These emergency measures are being taken to protect European crops from citrus black spot, a harmful plant disease not native to Europe," [an EU] statement says.

The decision leaves room for 'additional measures' to be imposed after five interceptions.

[Citrus black spot (CBS) caused by the fungus _Guignardia citricarpa_ is one of the most serious diseases of the crops in Asia and regions of the southern hemisphere. Symptoms can occur on leaves but are most severe on fruit. They include sunken lesions of varying size, shape, and colour depending on stage of fruit or leaf development. The disease may also lead to post-harvest losses since fruit may not show visible symptoms while on the tree. However, characteristic lesions may develop in storage under suitable conditions. Fungal strains which do not cause symptoms also exist. Black spot causes significant losses due to premature fruit and leaf drop and disfiguration of fruit for fresh markets.

Spores are produced under fallen leaves and sometimes on fruit. Spread occurs by air currents, on contaminated plant material (including nursery plants or scions with latent infections), and by mechanical means. The disease is particularly virulent late in the season, and losses tend to be most severe in late maturing varieties. All commercial citrus cultivars are susceptible to varying extents, except for sour orange (_Citrus aurantium_). Disease management includes fungicides, phytosanitation, and pathogen exclusion.

The threat of CBS introduction has been an issue in Europe for several years. The disease has been included in the A1 quarantine list of the European Plant Protection Organisation (EPPO). CBS has also recently been introduced into the USA by unknown means (2010; ProMED-mail post 20100412.1183), and this further illustrates the risk to northern hemisphere citrus industries. Once established in a region, eradication of a sporulating fungus such as _G. citricarpa_ is considered impossible.

The EU's concern is a large number of quarantine detections in 2013 (ProMED-mail post 20131204.2090761) which implies that certification of disease freedom at point of origin in South Africa is not working effectively. Therefore, an import ban appears necessary to protect European citrus industries.
