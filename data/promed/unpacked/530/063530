We are seriously concerned that the RVF epidemic in Kenya and southern
Somalia may be spreading both north and south.
In northern Somalia the nomadic pastoralists graze their sheep and goats
there and also in the Ogaden region across the border in Ethiopia. Hargeisa
is the entrepot for cattle from the interior of Ogaden and from southern
Somalia as they are collected together before going down to the port of
Berbera, 3 days walk away, for export to Saudi Arabia. Sheep, goats, and
camels are also exported through this port. If RVF has reached Hargeisa,
the risk to the Arabian Peninsula is clear.
The reported spread of the disease through other Kenyan provinces raises
the potential for spread to Tanzania.
If any of our readers has information on the developing situation, we would
be grateful to have it. Please be sure to give us sources and dates.
