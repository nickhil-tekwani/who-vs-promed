The 1st death from pertussis in Nueces County [Texas] was reported by authorities on Wed 18 Dec 2013, just after a press conference held by the Corpus Christi-Nueces County Health District focused on the increase of pertussis cases in the Coastal Bend, and the urgent need of vaccination to prevent the illness. A Corpus Christi baby of 6 months succumbed to the illness after a lengthy battle, having been hospitalized since 28 Aug 2013. Looking back on their records, the Health District states that the baby's death was the 1st in Corpus Christi for 2013, and may have been the 1st area death in over a decade from pertussis, otherwise known as whooping cough.

A report from the Corpus Christi-Nueces County Public Health District states that the level of pertussis cases in Nueces County has been on a recent rise, with 16 cases reported in the area in 2013; 11 of those cases requiring hospitalization. With all of that being said, the fact remains, pertussis is preventable. "Pertussis is preventable through vaccine and it is of vital importance that anyone who is around a pregnant female receives their pertussis vaccine," said Annette Rodriguez, MPH, Director of Public Health.

Dr Jaime Fergie, Pediatric Infectious Diseases, Driscoll Children's Hospital, further stressed this point, stating that the most important thing to prevent pertussis is for pregnant females to receive the vaccination in their 3rd trimester, and for all other relatives who will come into close proximity with the newborn to receive the vaccination [at least] 2 weeks before the baby is due.

According to the Corpus Christi-Nueces County Public Health District, pertussis is an extremely serious respiratory infection, with the pertussis bacteria attacking the lungs and breathing tubes. It causes uncontrollable coughing.

Dr Fergie states that the whooping cough infects adults, and can cause many problems, but when a child under 2 (such as an infant who has not built up a tolerance or acquired the antibodies to fight against the infection) contracts the illness, it can be extremely harmful, or even deadly.

The death reported on Wed 18 Dec 2013 may be the 1st in 2013, but once again, there is a rising trend in cases. Remember to vaccinate early, in order to prevent more severe cases of pertussis.

Pertussis, also known as whooping cough, is on a historic rise according to health officials. As of 16 Dec 2013, Texas has reported 3482 pertussis cases to the CDC for 2013 and has reported 3 deaths due to pertussis. Texas has not seen case numbers this high since 1959. Over the previous 3 weeks, there have been 3 cases of pertussis reported to the Brownwood/Brown County Health Department. The Brownwood/Brown County Health Department encourages the citizens of Brownwood and Brown County to check vaccination records and get vaccinated for this disease.

Pertussis is most harmful to young babies and can be deadly. It is very important that pregnant women and caregivers of babies maintain their Tdap [combined tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis] vaccination.

Local health officials are continuing to see a number of cases of pertussis, or whooping cough. The Wood County Health Department is still seeing infections. Public health nurse Diane Rodd says they've had 31 cases of pertussis so far in 2013. "Approximately 24 out of those 31 have occurred since 1 Nov 2013. So we are seeing an increase."

Rodd says many of the people being infected are students who are nearly out of date with their shots. "Because of that, the protection they got in kindergarten is starting to wane, and so they're a little more susceptible." The early symptoms are much like catching a cold, but the mild cough progressively worsens to severe coughing spells. These coughing spells can include whooping and vomiting. Health officials say the illness can last nearly 6 weeks, and is contagious if left untreated. A course of antibiotics is available to help lessen the length of the disease, and Rodd says they need to do their job. "We want to make sure people go through the entire cycle of antibiotics before going out into the public."

The outbreak of pertussis cases in Clark County follows a national trend that shows that whooping cough rates reached a 50-year high in 2012. Clark County has had a record 117 confirmed and suspected cases of pertussis since 1 Oct 2013, up from 98 before the Thanksgiving holiday [28 Nov 2013], Clark County Combined Health District Director Charles Patterson said. Patterson expressed frustration Friday [6 Dec 2013] after announcing the pertussis outbreak continued to climb in the area. "There is some frustration because, if one family with the disease has extended family of 10 people, and each of them spread it to 5 or 10 people, it makes it difficult to stop," Patterson said.

In 2013, Ohio has seen a 20 percent increase in reported pertussis cases, compared to 2012. As of 2 Nov 2013, there had been 901 cases reported in 2013, compared with 742 on the same date in 2012. Clark, Madison, Pickaway, Licking, Delaware, and Richland counties have the highest rates of the disease statewide, according to the Ohio Department of Health.

Over the past month the Northeast Colorado Health Department [NCHD] has received notification of 14 positive cases of pertussis, also known as whooping cough, in Phillips County, according to a recent press release.

The majority of the positive cases are in school-aged children and even though the cases are concentrated in Phillips County at this time, case rates are high across the state. Health officials are urging individuals that have a cough, or have a family member that has a cough, that has lasted more than 14 days to see their healthcare provider, and to make sure family member vaccinations are up to date.

"Pertussis has been circulating at epidemic levels in Colorado for the past couple of years so it's not surprising we're seeing increased cases in our area," said Dr Tony Cappello, NCHD's public health director, in the release. "While this infection can just be a nagging cough for some people, it can be very severe and even deadly for infants and others with compromised immune systems. This is not an illness you want to pass on to an infant that doesn't have the immunity to fight it off; whether it be your own grandchild, a neighbor's new baby, or your own newborn.

"It can also be very hard to get rid of once it gets in a community," continued Dr Cappello. "Over the course of our case investigations in Phillips County we've had to touch base with several other school districts alerting them to probable exposures at school events. The best thing that people can do if they think they have pertussis is to visit their healthcare provider, stay home if they're ill, cover their cough, stay away from infants, wash their hands, and make sure they're up to date on vaccinations."

[6] Pathogen evolution
Date: Mon 23 Dec 2013

http://www.popsci.com/article/science/whooping-cough-has-evolved-response-its-vaccine


This is not your parents' pertussis. Over the last few years, this once-common childhood illness, also known as whooping cough, has evolved in response to its own vaccine, according to a new study from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The mutated pertussis is not more dangerous than the original, and vaccines against the illness are still effective. So the findings don't change researchers' and doctors' understanding of whooping cough as a public health problem. Instead, they're a glimpse into a fascinating natural phenomenon, and one that's happening as we speak. (Though this isn't the 1st time this has happened. Populations of pneumococcal illnesses changed after the introduction of its vaccine, prompting changes to the vaccine to deal with newly popular strains.) The whooping cough findings have kicked off research to determine whether this is related to the recent increase in whooping cough cases in the US.

Paul Offit, chief of the division of infectious diseases at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, was not involved in the CDC study, but took part in a conference call about the study in which CDC researchers presented their results. He talked with Popular Science over the phone immediately after the call.

"We discussed the data and what the data allow us to say and what they don't allow us to say," he says. "The data don't support the notion that the mutants are more virulent." Babies who fall ill from un-mutated pertussis have the same symptoms as babies who fall ill from mutated pertussis, he says.

There's also no evidence yet that pertussis vaccines are less effective against the new strains, say all of the researchers Popular Science talked with, both in and outside of the CDC. Everyone recommended Americans continue to get vaccinated right on schedule. "Currently, we know it's the best form of protection we have," says Lucia Pawloski, the CDC scientist who led the new research. Kids who don't get vaccinated against pertussis are still 8 times as likely as vaccinated kids to get the disease, she adds.

Nevertheless, it's plausible whooping cough's changes do affect the vaccine's ability to protect. "Yes, theoretically, there could be an issue, but we don't have any data to say that yet," Pawloski says. The CDC is interested in answering this question and hopefully will have data to do so in 6 or 8 months, Offit says.

So what exactly is different about pertussis nowadays? Since 2010, Pawloski and her colleagues have recorded a sharp rise in the US in strains of the illness that don't make a protein called pertactin. Before 2010, researchers saw only one US pertussis infection, from 1994, in which the bacteria didn't make pertactin. By 2012, the majority of pertussis infections researchers studied were caused by non-pertactin-making pertussis. Pawloski and her team examined 1300 samples taken from whooping cough outbreaks between 1935 and 2012.

Pertussis bacteria make thousands of proteins, but pertactin happens to be one of the few included in many forms of the vaccine used in developed countries, including the US. "We've created this selective pressure," Offit says, by widely using vaccines with pertactin in them.

When the proteins and other molecules in a vaccine enter your body through a shot, your immune system finds them, learns to recognize them, and develops defenses against them. Now, if you ever truly encounter that illness, your body will respond quickly to quash it. If the vaccine contains pertactin and the actual illness doesn't, that means your body is learning to recognize something that's useless to it when it encounters whooping cough.

All pertussis vaccines used in developed countries have one, 2, or 3 other pertussis molecules besides pertactin, so there's still stuff in there for your body to train on, even if pertactin is now useless. How much of a blow -- if any at all -- losing pertactin deals to vaccines that have other active molecules is still unclear. "I think at this point it's hard to say exactly what it means for the vaccines' effectiveness," says Nicola Klein, co-director of the Kaiser Permanente Vaccine Study Center in California. Klein was not involved in the CDC study.

Meanwhile, pertussis vaccines often used in developing countries contain entire killed _Bordetella pertussis_ bacteria, so they actually contain perhaps thousands of things the body is able to use to learn to recognize whooping cough. Those vaccines, which are cheaper to make, were discontinued in developed countries because they cause severe, if non-permanent, side effects, such as seizures in babies.

CDC researchers now are looking into whether losing pertactin is related to another phenomenon associated with the increasing popularity of the newer whooping cough vaccines. Recent studies have found that even those kids who get all their recommended pertussis shots -- in the US administered as the DTaP [diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis] shot -- are vulnerable again to whooping cough at about age 8 or 10. Researchers think the new vaccine is why the US saw more cases of whooping cough in 2012 than it has in any year since 1955. The older shot, with the killed bacteria, protected people for longer. Scientists are unsure what exactly made the tougher stuff longer-lasting, however.

Is pertussis' evolution the answer? That's not certain yet. "We couldn't say yes or no at this point whether pertactin had a role in the waning of immunity," Pawloski says.

The number of cases of pertussis over time tends to have upswing cycles every 3-5 years but the case increases have been greater and more prolonged in the past several years. Utah is just one of a number of USA states including Washington and Wisconsin that have had substantial increase in the disease with, in addition, infant deaths related to cases transmitted by family members. Most up-to-date ACIP (Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices) recommendations continue to increase vaccination recommendations to order to "cocoon" the susceptible infant cohort. The most recent recommendations include re-vaccination for pregnant women in the 2nd or 3rd trimester for each pregnancy (1).

In addition to the Tartlof paper (2), an additional recent publication, currently in press in Clinical Infectious Disease (3), utilizes a large cohort of young people receiving all of the health care at the Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in San Rafael, California, USA, and clearly shows that a markedly increased risk of pertussis occurs associated with those who received only acellular pertussis vaccine. As compared to those who received at least one dose of the killed, whole cell pertussis vaccine (prior to the switch to all acellular dosing), the relative risk of acquiring pertussis was 8.57 in those receiving 5 doses of the acellular vaccine, but fell to a relative risk of 3.55 in those receiving 6 doses of the acellular vaccine.
