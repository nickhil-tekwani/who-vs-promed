According to residents of Atan, a village of 400 in the Lori
[province], there has been an outbreak of disease among their
livestock that has lasted for 15 or 20 days now. Said Susanna
Simonyan, "All the animals in the village are sick, saliva drips from
their mouths, they can't walk, they fall down, and they have sores on
their bodies. The efforts of the village veterinarian have been
ineffective; there is little medicine available and not all the
animals receive it. Furthermore, he cannot help all the animals by
himself, and there is no help from outside."
The residents of Atan have decided to get together and go to the Lori
Marz administration for help. According to the Atan-Alaverdi bus
driver, "Mayor Shaliko's cow died, and he threw it into the canyon
last night [9 Jul 2007]. There are 2000 animals in the village and 4
out of 5 are sick."
The residents of Atan depend on their livestock for survival. Many
have gone into debt to pay for their animals, and now they are very
worried. Not only that, but because of the epidemic they have been
unable to save up for the winter months.
"The epidemic came into Atan from Noyemberyan and Dilijan, which
border 40 km (almost 19 mi) of our meadows," said Vruyr Marukyan,
Atan's veterinarian.
Hamlet Apresyan, senior veterinarian at the Anti-Epidemic Veterinary
Center said, "The animals in Atan are not sick with the plague, but
with blackleg, which is a form of cholera." [Blackleg or black
quarter is a bacterial disease caused by _Clostridium chauvoei_. -
Mod.AS], Apresyan explained that the disease had been caused by the
lengthy drought, and that Lori veterinarians were aware of the
condition of the animals in Atan and had sent 2 shipments of medicine
to the village. At the Anti-Epidemic Center, veterinarians from other
areas commented that the disease is easy to treat, and that 2 or 3
days was enough to cure all the animals. But if so, why had the
epidemic in Atan been going on for 15 days, and was now threatening
Shamut, Lorut, and other nearby villages? The senior veterinarian
explained, "On our end, all the instructions were sent. But the drugs
are administered on their end, and the next moment the animals walk
into the mud. They need sunny weather. We received drugs; the
services provided were paid for out of the state budget. The Atan
case wasn't planned for; the disease came from outside, and we are
working within our resources."
Aram Martirosyan, the chief expert the Lori Branch of the Agriculture
Ministry's Food Safety Department, admitted that more should have
been done to deal with the emergency in Atan, and that veterinarians
face serious difficulties elsewhere in the Tumanyan region as well.
"We do whatever we can. There are 2000 animals in Atan and only one
veterinarian. He cannot physically vaccinate so many animals and stay
within the limits of the state budget. The villagers think that it's
the same veterinary service as it was during Soviet times, that
everything from antibiotics to iodine comes out of the state budget.
But the only thing the state budget pays for is vaccines," Martirosyan said.
The conversation with Martirosyan revealed that no laboratory
diagnosis had been performed in Atan or the neighboring sites of the
epidemic; rather the diagnosis had been done on the spot. The expert
tried to persuade us that there was nothing to worry about. We
wondered why people in Atan were so frightened. He replied, "To put
it bluntly, they want to make a big scandal out of this. They found
out that there is a drug "X" available, and the government can give
them money, so they don't have to spend anything, they don't have to
pay 1000 drams [USD 2.88] for alum or magnesium. The villagers think
that the veterinarian is obliged to tend to their animals from
morning to night."
The Drug "X" Martirosyan is referring to is the famous Armenikum [a
drug supposed to raise immunity. - Mod.AS], which most veterinarians
view with skepticism, saying that no matter how much they injected
into livestock last year [2006], the animals still died.
The chief expert and the veterinarians who gathered in his office
also complained about their low salaries, which they receive once
every 6 [weeks? months?], explaining that it's impossible to support
a family on what they are paid.
Only 22 of the Tumanyan region's 31 communities have veterinarians.
The center has no car and no place to administer vaccines. Yet it's
impossible to vaccinate animals located 35 km (21.75 mi) apart by
foot, because one ampoule of vaccine is intended for 100 animals, and
often there aren't that many animals on one mountain, but the vaccine
loses its usefulness within 4 hours of being opened. The
veterinarians also complained that they do not receive syringes and
needles, or sometimes they do get syringes, but no needles. Also,
there is no facility in the region where animals can be slaughtered,
and this can cause the outbreak of disease.

[Lori is one of Armenia's 10 provinces, bordering Georgia on the
north; see map at
<http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/commonwealth/armenia_pol_2002.jpg>.
The symptoms and the 80 percent morbidity rate, as described by the
locals, do not leave ample room for doubts of a foot-and-mouth
disease (FMD) outbreak in susceptible, unvaccinated bovine
population. However, without laboratory confirmation (which should
also include typing), the case has to remain "suspected".
Armenia has denied unofficial reports on FMD outbreaks during 2006;
our request of 30 May 2007 for information on a suspected outbreak in
the Syunik province, south-east Armenia, more than 300 km (186 mi)
distant from Lori, has not yet been answered.
Verification is within the capacity of Armenia's responsible
authority. - Mod.AS]
