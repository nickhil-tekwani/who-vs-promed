Medical authorities have sounded a health warning in Dibrugarh district following the death of 18 persons from Japanese encephalitis (JE) and acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) this year.

Confirming the death toll, joint director of health services (Dibrugarh) Udayan Kumar Baruah on [Fri 29 Jun 2018] said so far 13 persons have died of AES while 5 persons have succumbed to Japanese encephalitis. It has been confirmed that another 105 persons are suffering from encephalitis (75 from AES, 30 from JE) after their blood sample were tested at the laboratories of the Lahowal Regional Medical Research Centre (RMRC) in Lahowal.

"Another 105 patients have been confirmed as encephalitis positive, out of which 75 have AES and 30 have JE. They are being treated at the Assam Medical College and Hospital and various PHCs [primary health centres]. They are in various stages of recovery. We are trying out best to combat the vector-borne disease," Baruah said. He added that regular fogging is being carried out in the encephalitis-prone areas while anti-larval pesticides are being sprayed in sewers and drains in waterlogged areas. Long-lasting insecticidal nets and insecticide treated bed nets are also being distributed among people in the affected areas.

Naharani primary health centre, with 6 AES deaths and 3 JE deaths, recorded the maximum causalities followed by Barbaruah and Khowang PHCs with 3 deaths each (2 JE, 1 AES cases each), Tengakhat PHC with 2 deaths (AES), and Lahowal PHC which recorded a single AES death. The outbreak of Japanese encephalitis usually coincides with the monsoon and post-monsoon seasons, when weather conductions are conducive for mosquitoes to breed.

[With the report above, the number of encephalitis cases has increased in this area in Assam state to 105. Of these, 30 are confirmed to have JE and 75 with AES of unspecified etiology. The etiology of AES has been unclear but debated in the past decade. It is odd that no mention is made of JE vaccination in the report above, which would be more effective at preventing JE cases than fogging of residences. The _Culex_ mosquitoes that transmit JE virus breed in extensive wetlands including rice paddies. However, application of anti-larval pesticides in sewers and drains in waterlogged areas may be helpful. Long-lasting insecticidal nets and insecticide treated bed nets may also reduce numbers of JE virus vector mosquitoes in houses.

As noted previously, a recent publication of investigations conducted during the 2014 and 2015 AES outbreaks indicated that scrub typhus, caused by _Orientia tsutsugamushi_, was the etiology in about 60 percent of those AES cases. In the report above, there is no mention of scrub typhus.

As noted in many earlier posts, the determination of the etiology or etiologies of AES has been confusing and elusive. Various etiological agents have been proposed in recent years as responsible for AES cases. AES has continued to be attributed to a variety of etiologies, including Reye syndrome-like disease, possible enterovirus infection from polluted water, heat stroke, lychee fruit consumption, and scrub typhus (_O. tsutsugamushi_). One hopes that the prospective studies on collaboration with the USA CDC as the season for occurrence of encephalitis cases in children progresses will provide additional information about the etiology of AES. The JE and AES season is now underway in northeastern India, and many cases of encephalitis in children are likely to occur again this year (2018).
