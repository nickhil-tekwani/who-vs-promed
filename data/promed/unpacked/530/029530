Woman tests positive for rabies
-------------------------------
A critically ill woman has contracted rabies, tests have confirmed.
The Eastern Health Board said the risk to other people is
"negligible." The woman is a patient in the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast.

"There is no documented case of human-to-human transmission of rabies
anywhere in the world," said the board. It added that the patient had
previously been overseas in an area associated with rabies in animals
and may have been bitten there. "The patient poses no risk to other
patients or to visitors, and all its services are continuing as
normal," a statement from the board said. "All necessary steps on
infection control are in place for the protection of staff."

The disease is extremely rare and the last case in Northern Ireland
was in 1938.

The Eastern Board said it was taking advice from the Health
Protection Agency and the Veterinary Laboratories Agency. Other
agencies working with the board include the Department of Health, the
Department of Agriculture, and the Communicable Diseases Surveillance
Centre (Northern Ireland).
