Olga Gavrilenko, the senior public health official in the Moscow
Region, urged citizens to seek post-exposure vaccination as soon as
possible after sustaining a bite and to avoid handling wild animals.
She said that already in 2009, there had been 2 instances of attacks
by rabid dogs. In one case, an unvaccinated domestic dog contracted
rabies and bit 14 humans in the town and neighborhood of
Kikino-Dulevo. In the town of Krasnoarmeysk, a dog bit 10 persons,
including 7 children.

Gavrilenko stated that 4 persons died in the Moscow Region during
2008 as a result of rabies virus infection; 3 of them resided in
the Moscow region and one in the city of Moscow. All cases were the
result of bites from wild animals, 2 as a result of fox bites and one
as the result of a raccoon dog bite. There is no information
available regarding the 4th case.

During the course of 2008, some 25 000 people, including 5000
children, required medical treatment as a result of animal bites.
