Viet Nam nurse tested negative for bird flu
-------------------------------------------
A female nurse suspected as having bird flu has tested negative for
the disease, Vietnamese health officials have announced. Test results
provided by the Center for Tropical Diseases in Hanoi showed the
nurse was free of H5N1, the deadly strain of avian influenza, said
Viet Nam's Central Institution of Sanitation and Epidemiology on 13
Mar 2005.
The nurse, who worked in a hospital in the Red River Delta province
of Thai Binh, was previously thought to be infected and was
hospitalized for treatment.
Another male nurse, infected with bird flu 4 days ago after having
had direct contact with infected patients, has shown signs of
improvement, doctors said.
The institution is now carrying out an extensive search on how the
virus gets circulated in the province of Thai Binh, where a number of
people were found to be affected by the disease.
