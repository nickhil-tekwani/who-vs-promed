Isolation of HTLV-II from a Brazilian patient with a brain disorder
------------------------------------------------------------
Scientists in Brazil said on Tuesday that they had found a case of a rare
brain disorder caused by a virus closely related to human immunodeficiency
virus (HIV), a discovery which could lead to better understanding of AIDS.
Blood samples taken from a 53-year-old garbage collector - who had
developed slurred speech, sluggish reflexes and difficulty walking - show
she had contracted human T-cell lymphotropic virus type II (HTLV-II), a
virus similar to HIV, said Wagner de Oliveira, a spokesperson for the Rio
de Janeiro-based Oswaldo Cruz Institute, which conducted the research.
While HTLV-II itself is not rare - hundreds of thousands of people are
known to have been infected with this virus since the early 1980s -
scientists had identified only about 12 cases in the world of people who
show such symptoms. The samples taken from the garbage collector adds to
the evidence that the virus can cause a series of neurological disturbances
like those found in multiple sclerosis patients, said Oliveira. [The
chronic degenerative diseases associated with HTLV-I, unlike multiple
sclerosis, are progressive and unremitting. The pathogenic potential of
HTLV-II has been generally considered to be uncertain, despite its presence
in some rare cases of CD8 lymphoproliferative disease and
neuromyelopathies. - Mod.CP
The HTLV-II virus remains "a question mark to science, but this study gives
us a first light", said Oliveira. HTLV-II is a [human retrovirus that
infects white blood cells. It is considered by scientists to be a "cousin"
of the HIV virus because it behaves and is contracted like the AIDS virus,
said Oliveira. [The HTLVs are in fact more closely related taxonomically to
Bovine leukemia virus than to the HIVs. - Mod.CP. The research is of
pressing concern for Brazil, where about 30 percent of Amazonian Indians
carry the virus, although this is the first discovery of neurological
symptoms, said the Institute spokesperson.

[The significance of this report is uncertain, unless there are unstated
pathological features. HTLV-I was isolated first from a cell line derived
from splenic cells taken from a patient suffering from a hairy cell
leukemia, now considered to be a fortuitous association. HTLV-II is known
now to be endemic among several Amerindian populations in North, Central
and South America. In industrialized countries HTLV-II is prevalent among
drug abusers and is spread by contaminated needles and by heterosexual
transmission. In the developing world breastfeeding may be the predominant
route of transmission. Biologically, the HTLVs differ from HIV in their
greater genetic stability and their characteristic patterns of geographic
distribution. The present distribution of HTLV-II in the world has been
interpreted to be a consequence of the introduction of HTLV-II into the New
world at the time of the initial settlement of the American continent by
the ancestors of the present day native Americans some 20 000 to 40 000
years ago, followed by more recent dissemination from one or a few sources.
This interpretation is confounded, however, by the absence of any remnant
of an endemic population in Asia and presence of HTLV-II in remote Pygmy
communities in Africa. - Mod.CP
