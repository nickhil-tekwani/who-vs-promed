Rabies continues to threaten Flores Island in East Nusa Tenggara (NT), as there have been thousands of reports of dog bites in the region over the last 15 years. Since 1997, 205 people have died from rabies in Flores, according to Sikka health agency. "Each and every day, there are more than 20 people who make reports that they are bitten by rabies-infected dogs," Regina Ester, the head of the infectious disease division at the Sikka health agency said on Tuesday [10 Jul 2012].

Dogs infected with rabies have also been found in downtown Maumere, the capital of Sikka regency and the largest city on Flores island. "Previously, such dogs were only found in suburban areas, but now it has spread to the heart of the city," Regina added. According to a report from the agency, 2 people died from rabies in the 1st 6 months of 2012, while there were 1032 cases of dogs biting people in the same period. There were 2866 cases of dog bites in Flores in 2011.

A proposal to euthanize stray dogs to stop the spread of the virus was rejected by local residents who called the initiative inhumane. There are about 50 000 dogs in Flores. "Residents who have dogs should keep their pets in kennels to prevent the spread of the disease. This is much cheaper than destroying the infected dogs," Asep Purnama, the rabies chief at TC Hillers Maumere Hospital said.

[Merritt Clifton has provided the following commentary on this press report:

(Of the 205 reported human rabies deaths in connection with the Flores outbreak, 113 occurred between September 1997 and June 2004. In 2008, approximately 70 percent of the dog population in the affected communities were killed, according to data gathered by the Indonesian Ministry of Health rabies control expert Caccilia Windiyaningsih, in the November 2004 edition of the Journal of the Medical Association of Thailand.

"Before the current rabies outbreak, there were an estimated 600 000 to 800 000 dogs on the island," Windiyaningsih elaborated. "Almost all were owned and semi-controlled. They had not been vaccinated against rabies, since rabies had never been reported previously in Flores. Dogs were kept as watchdogs, pets, for food, and for trade."

Dog meat sellers, not street dogs, were most culpable for the spread of rabies on Flores. "Some citizens did not kill their dogs and moved them to the next, as yet rabies-free district and sold them in markets," Windiyaningsih explained. "Some of these dogs incubated rabies, and this contributed to the spread to other districts."

In East Flores, where the rabies outbreak started, 53 204 dogs were killed in 1998. Only 5314 dogs remained as of 2002, of whom only 40 percent were vaccinated, not even close to the 70 percent vaccination rate needed to stop an epidemic and less than half of the 85 percent rate that the World Health Organization recommends as the goal of vaccination campaigns to create a margin of safety. Across the whole of Flores, 80 percent of the dog population was killed. Just 46 percent of the survivors were vaccinated.

"An additional 226 698 or more dogs were killed after 1999," Windiyaningsih continued. "Nevertheless, canine rabies was not eliminated. Out of 2881 dogs tested for rabies, 2318 were found positive (80 percent)."

Windiyaningsih recommended saturation vaccination of dogs, just as Henry Wilde of the Queen Saovabha Memorial Institute in Thailand and WHO rabies expert F.X. Meslin had earlier. Eight years later, the saturation vaccination has yet to be done, and another 92 people have died). - Merritt Clifton

ProMED-mail endorses this comment and supports the recommendation for saturation vaccination of the canine population of Flores.
