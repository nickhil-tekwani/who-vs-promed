Update: European LGV epidemic among men who have sex with men
--------------------------------------------------
The Europe-wide epidemic of lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV), caused by
_Chlamydia trachomatis_ serovar L2, is continuing. It is affecting men who
have sex with men (MSM), many of whom are HIV-positive. Outbreaks and
various case reports have been described in several European countries and,
more recently, in the USA and Canada. The outbreak is of public health
importance, since LGV facilitates transmission of HIV and other blood-borne
infections.
Overview of the LGV situation in Europe (Mar 2005):
--------------------------------------------------
In the Netherlands, 144 confirmed cases of LGV had been reported by March
2005, the majority in Amsterdam: 65 cases in 2002-2003 were identified
retrospectively. In France, 142 cases of LGV have been confirmed, mainly in
Paris and Bordeaux, of which 21 in 2002-2003 were identified retrospectively.
In the United Kingdom (UK), 34 confirmed cases have been reported since
October 2004, the majority in London, with others reported in cities across
the UK: 8 were identified retrospectively. Concurrent incident infections
with hepatitis C were diagnosed in the Netherlands and the UK. Only small
clusters of cases have been reported from other European countries: 8 cases
in Belgium, 20 cases in Germany, 3 cases in Sweden and 1 in Spain.
Preliminary results of active surveillance systems in The Netherlands,
France, the UK and the USA describe broadly similar trends and responses to
the epidemics. The current outbreak of LGV is occurring in MSM only and is
characterized by severe anorectal infections with long-lasting symptoms
including rectal pain, tenesmus, rectal discharge, and constipation. The
majority of LGV patients are HIV-positive. All reported a variety of sexual
risk behaviors, including unprotected anal sex, with numerous anonymous
partners. Epidemiological investigations of transmission risk factors are
underway.
Recognition of cases:
---------------------
At first, rapid recognition of the outbreaks was hindered, because doctors
and patients were not familiar with the signs and symptoms of the disease.
There is a lack of licensed chlamydia polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests
for rectal specimens and genotyping facilities. Reporting LGV is not
mandatory in many countries and new cases have often not been reported in a
timely way.
Notification through ESSTI ALERT (European Surveillance of Sexually
Transmitted Infections early warning and alert system), informed
epidemiologists in Europe of early LGV cases with international links, and
prompted the investigation of possible LGV cases in the Netherlands and France.
Active surveillance for LGV was implemented in the Netherlands in Jan 2004,
in France in March 2004 and in the UK in Oct 2004. Retrospective evaluation
of possible cases in The Netherlands and France has confirmed that MSM with
LGV were presenting to medical services as early as 2002.
Microbiological and clinical issues of LGV:
------------------------------------------
The laboratory diagnosis of LGV ideally uses direct detection of _Chlamydia
trachomatis_ specific DNA in rectal specimens followed by amplification of
the omp1 gene using nested PCR and restriction endonuclease digestion to
identify LGV specific serovars (L1, L2 or L3). However, _C. trachomatis_
nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) are not licensed for use on rectal
or pharyngeal specimens. Most commercial platforms perform well for rectal
specimens, but currently only reference laboratories and major centers with
rectal specimen testing experience have validated these tests for use.
Using unlicensed tests and the complexity of the confirmatory tests may
have hindered the identification of LGV cases. Real-time PCR is needed that
will identify L2 serovars directly from the specimen to allow timely and
sensitive detection.
Preliminary results from ongoing clinical studies demonstrate that LGV-2
infections occur also in patients with no signs or symptoms. The 1st case
of urethritis caused by LGV-2 in France was found in a male patient with no
other genital or anorectal complaints. Wider screening of MSM is needed,
but this requires a validated real-time PCR. Such tests are currently being
validated by a number of laboratories, including one in Amsterdam and the
United States CDC.
Serology has been widely used to diagnose LGV, but this is not specific
enough. However, direct detection may not always be possible, and serology
may have a role if the rectal specimen is negative, inhibitory, or it is
not possible to amplify the omp1 gene. A high antibody titer in patients
with proctitis is highly suspicious of LGV, whereas a low antibody titer
with evidence of symptoms cannot confirm or exclude LGV.
Sequence diversity within the omp1 gene has been used to further identify
strain variation. In the Amsterdam outbreak, a single strain known as
AMSTLGVL2b was found, which has also been identified in France. Variants
have been detected in Germany and the UK. Confirmation of sequence variants
is necessary to define the limits of the outbreaks in the future.
Information needs to disseminated on confirmation of LGV strains (by
genotyping), evaluation of serology, international validation of the
real-time PCR and confirmation of sequence variants. Information on
reference laboratories should become available soon on the ESSTI website:
(<http://www.essti.org> )
International information exchange and collaboration results in
recommendations to diagnose and control outbreak ESSTI has facilitated
international information exchange and collaboration since cases were first
detected. In Apr 2005, a scientific conference was organized by ESSTI and
RIVM, the Netherlands. The meeting provided the opportunity to formulate
the following recommendations to improve LGV prevention and control efforts
across Europe:
-Clinical recognition still needs to be improved by increasing awareness of
sexually transmitted infections among general physicians.
-Updated clinical information and guidance for investigation (including
standardized questionnaires), diagnosis and management should be placed on
the ESSTI website.
-International comparison of strains is required. More information sharing
among European microbiologists would be beneficial.
-A Europe-wide accepted case definition and international recommendations
for standard diagnostic methods are needed as quickly as possible.
-ESSTI should publish a list of reference laboratories competent at
confirming LGV diagnosis.
-International internet-based anonymous reporting of LGV cases (real-time
surveillance) should be considered.
-A multi-center study on epidemic characteristics and clinical features of
LGV proctitis among MSM should be considered.
-There is a continuing need for targeted interventions to improve the
sexual health of MSM.
Since European countries are not equally affected by the LGV epidemics, it was
recommended that:
In countries with no or few reported cases at present, more awareness of
LGV is needed in the MSM community. Clinicians need information about the
clinical features of LGV, diagnostics and methods of reporting. These
countries should begin to identify laboratory diagnostic facilities and
reference centers.
In countries with a number of reported cases, active surveillance should be
implemented and the transmission risk factors and clinical features need to
be investigated thoroughly. International collaboration should increase the
power of descriptive and analytic investigations.

[This is a cogent report on the growing outbreak of LGV in Europe and North
America and summarizes diagnostic considerations well. The failure to have
protected sex -- which is most likely caused by the idea that HIV infection
is now not the death sentence it once was and perhaps the increasing and
widespread use of crystal methamphetamine -- is clearly fueling the spread
of the infection. - Mod.LL]
