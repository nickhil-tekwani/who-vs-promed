Foot-and-mouth disease hits Viet Nam
-----------------------------------------------------
Vietnam's central provinces of Quang Binh and Quang Nam have been
stricken by foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] in the last few days,
according to local media on Friday [23 Feb 2007]. The disease broke
out in Dong Hoi city of Quang Binh, affecting 2 bulls, and in Tam Ky
city of Quang Nam, infecting 7 pigs and 8 bulls, buffaloes,
the newspapers Pioneer and Youth reported.
The 2 provincial veterinary bureaus have [disinfected] affected
farms, and vaccinated healthy cattle against the disease in the localities.
However, the Department of Animal Health under the Vietnamese
Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development has yet to announce
outbreaks of FMD in the 2 provinces.
Now, the disease has hit 18 communes in 5 provinces, namely Tuyen
Quang, Yen Bai and Thai Nguyen in the north, and Phu Yen and Kon Tum
in the central region, said the department.
Under a national agriculture development plan approved by the
government in 2005, Vietnam will, by 2010, have 35-40 million pigs,
6.5-6.7 million bulls and cows, 2.8-3 million buffaloes, and 380-
390 million poultry.

[According to a posting dated 4 Feb 2007 (archived 20070204.0448, 11
Vietnamese provinces were reportedly affected at that time, namely
Cao Bang, Tuyen Quang, Lang Son, Yen Bai, Thai Nguyen, Phu Tho
provinces in the north; Can Tho City, HCMC, Soc Trang, Dong Nai in
the south; and Kon Tum province in the central highlands. The current
newswire adds 2 provinces, Quang Binh and Quang Nam but states that
only 5 provinces are declared infected. Clarification will help. For
an administrative map, see

Viet-Nam's last report on the prevailing FMD situation, including a
detailed table and a map, dates back to Oct 2006; it is accessible at

According to the said table, all outbreaks during October 2006 were
caused by FMDV serotype O. A new update will be helpful. - Mod. AS].
