Maryland: hepatitis C fatality in Baltimore shrouded in mystery
-----------------------------------------------
As thousands of other patients do every year, a patient walked into a
Glen Burnie cardiology clinic last October [2004] for a routine
cardiac stress test. But what happened over the next 2 months wasn't
so routine: The 79-year-old retired ironworker developed a hepatitis
C infection that ultimately took his life on Christmas Day [25 Dec
2004]. The patient's death -- one of just 6 hepatitis C-related
fatalities officially recorded in Maryland since 1999 -- is drawing
new attention to an unusual medical mystery under investigation by
the Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene.
Officials have traced the patient's infection to a single vial of
technetium-99m, a radioactive isotope injected into the bloodstream
during stress tests and other routine diagnostic procedures.
Investigators won't say how many people have been infected, or where
they live. However, the company whose Timonium pharmacy prepared the
suspect isotope said the state has identified at least 12 people in
the Baltimore area. The 79-year old patient, who lived in Brooklyn
Park, is the only fatality.
The case has baffled physicians and nuclear medicine experts, who say
they can recall no other instance in which a common radioactive
isotope has become contaminated with [a] hepatitis [virus]. "It's
very unusual and not expected at all," says Fadia Shaya of the
University of Maryland School of Pharmacy, who chairs the state's
advisory council on hepatitis C. "This kind of thing should not
happen."
Hepatitis C, a liver disease caused by a virus of the same name, is
typically transmitted through infected blood or semen. The disease
kills as many as 10 000 people in the U.S. each year. The majority of
new infections are contracted through illicit drug use. The vial of
technetium-99m that officials suspect as the cause of the infection
here was prepared at a so-called nuclear pharmacy in Timonium.
Operated by Cardinal Health of Dublin, Ohio, the pharmacy specializes
in preparing radioactive "tracers" for a variety of diagnostic tests.
The company has temporarily closed the business until investigators
have pinpointed the source of the virus.
John Hammond, a spokesman for the Department of Health and Mental
Hygiene, said the hepatitis C outbreak does not pose a public health
risk and was confined to the small number of people injected with
serum from the tainted vial. Maryland, he said, recorded 26 cases of
hepatitis C in 2004, including those in the recent outbreak. The
state reported 9 cases the previous year and 14 cases in 2002.
One of the central mysteries is how the radioactive isotope could
have become contaminated, especially since the preparation of
technetium-99m is considered to be a straightforward process. "How in
the world did this happen?" says Nicki Hilliard, a nuclear pharmacist
at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences. "It's bizarre."
Hilliard said that the isotope is typically produced in a
pinkie-sized container known as a radionucleotide generator. To
create a dose, technicians pass standard saline solution through the
generator, a process known as "milking." As a result, the generators
themselves are sometimes known as "cows." Technicians capture the
saline in a small vial and stir in a powdered chemical tracer. The
tracer binds to the isotope and ferries it through the patient's
bloodstream to the specific organ or tissue that needs to be examined.
The victim's widow said her husband received the isotope during a
cardiac stress test at Arundel Heart Associates in Glen Burnie.
Before the test, she said, he was in good health, and the procedure
was considered routine. As part of the test, doctors typically inject
the isotope into the patient's bloodstream and ask the patient to
walk on a treadmill for a short period to increase the pulse rate.
Then they examine the patient's heart using a radiation-sensitive
camera to track blood flow and spot potential blockages.
Dr. Paul Young-Hyman, a cardiologist at the Glen Burnie clinic, said
the suspect isotope arrived at the clinic in October 2004 in 8
individually prepared syringes, each in a lead-lined container. All 8
patients who received the isotope on 15 Oct 2004 have since tested
positive for hepatitis C, he said. Young-Hyman said that when word
started filtering back that several patients who had stress tests
that day had been diagnosed with hepatitis, the clinic notified
county health officials, who ultimately contacted the state.
The cardiologist said all the clinic's employees have tested negative
for the virus, and health officials have examined the clinic's
laboratory and found it contamination free. As a precautionary
measure, however, stress tests at the clinic are now being performed
with a different radioactive tracer. "I'm just hoping that people who
need the study don't hold back on getting it," says Young-Hyman.
"This case really does fall into the category of bizarre."
Hepatitis C has an average incubation period of 6 to 8 weeks, and the
victim was fine until mid-November 2004, when he lost his appetite
and started to feel nauseous, family members said. His wife initially
chalked it up to stomach flu, from which she was just recovering. But
when he didn't improve, he went to see the doctor. A few days later,
tests came back positive for hepatitis C. Around this time, state
health officials began notifying hospitals and physicians to watch
for signs of the disease, including fatigue, jaundice, abdominal pain
and nausea. As his condition deteriorated in the following weeks, he
was admitted to North Arundel Hospital twice before finally being
taken to Harbor Hospital on 23 Dec 2004, and he died on Christmas Day
[25 Dec 2004].

[Hepatitis C virus is classified as the type species of the genus
_Hepacivirus_ in the family _Flaviviridae_. It is transmitted almost
exclusively by parenteral exposure to blood, blood products and
substances contaminated with blood. Sexual and perinatal transmission
occur rarely. Screening and inactivation procedures now ensure safety
of the blood supply. Blood-contaminated syringes, however, have
become a significant risk factor.
The circumstance whereby 8 patients receiving isotope from 8
individually prepared syringes delivered from a single pharmacy
points to the contamination occurring at the pharmacy preparing the
isotope rather than at the hospital administering the isotope to the
patients. The level of contamination of the isotope must have been
considerable to result in infection of all 8 patients. The staff of
the cardiology clinic have tested hepatitis C-negative, which further
suggests that the contamination occurred during preparation of the
isotope at the pharmacy. - Mod.CP]
