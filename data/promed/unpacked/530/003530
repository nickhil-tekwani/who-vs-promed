East. equine encephalitis vaccine availability 990827151313
Date: 6 September 1999
From: Charles H. Calisher <calisher@usa.healthnet.org>

Eastern equine encephalitis vaccine is not currently available from CDC.
Changes in FDA regulations governing these vaccines now make it very
difficult to obtain this and the other equine encephalitis vaccines
(western equine encephalitis and Venezuelan equine encephalitis) unless
people are willing to travel to USAMRIID, Fort Detrick to obtain vaccine,
keeping in mind that multiple dose regimens can mean multiple trips there.
An additional problem is that some of the vaccines are offline currently or
soon will be while required periodic potency testing of stored vaccine is
performed.
