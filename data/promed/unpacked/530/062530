An outbreak of anthrax has been recorded in the Almaty region in late
July [2010], revealing 4 [human] cases. As it turned out, several
local residents neglected veterinary examination of an affected cow,
the meat being sold. Currently, the veterinary services are carrying
out investigations to discover the contaminated meat, which could
reach the market near Almaty.

[Unfortunately it's the same old Central Asian story. Rural veterinary
services are weak to nonexistent, which fosters such events.
Apparently there have been a number of outbreaks recently in
Kazakhstan, not just around Almaty, which have not been reported. -
