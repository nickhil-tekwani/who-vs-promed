Situation of rural anthrax ("carbuncle") in Argentina, 2021
-----------------------------------------------------------

Summary
1. Assessment area of rural carbuncle in the province of Buenos Aires: after 45 years conducting epidemiological assessment, the presence of _Bacillus anthracis_ (Map 1, http://anav.org.ar/producion-cientifica/temas-de-actualidad/) continues to be observed in this area. In the 1977-2021 period, 4553 samples were assessed, and 470 (10%) turned out to be positive. In 2021 (Figure 1, http://anav.org.ar/producion-cientifica/temas-de-actualidad/), 45 samples were assessed, and one (2%) turned out to be positive, a sample that came from the district of Saladillo. Carbuncle is declining if we compare 6% of positive cases in the 5-year period from 2012 to 2016, against 1% in the 5-year period from 2017 to 2021. This achievement was the result of the coming into effect of law no. 6703-61 and resolution no.115/14, of the province of Buenos Aires.

2. Alert zone and response, district of Azul: The 67 bovine "carbuncle outbreaks" (2004-2013) are related to the surface runoff, thus resulting in rigorous alerts and responses. With a total susceptible population of animals, 414 231 bovines were vaccinated, 27 768 in excess of the number in the category. Since 2013, no bovine or human carbuncle outbreaks have been reported.

3. Isolations in other veterinary diagnostic labs: 5 labs took part in the assessment and they applied similar techniques in the provinces of Buenos Aires, La Pampa, and Rio Negro to process a total of 77 samples. These labs managed to isolate 2 (2%) strains of _Bacillus anthracis_, located in the provinces of La Pampa (district of Utracan) and Rio Negro (district of General Conesa), which proved the endemic nature of this zoonosis.

4. Districts of the province of Buenos Aires involved in carbuncle outbreaks: in 2021, there was one isolation of _Bacillus anthracis_ from a sporadic bovine outbreak in the district of Saladillo. The last one before had occurred in 2015, thus proving that spores may stay for years on hydro-halomorphic soils waiting to complete their natural cycle.

5. Production of anti-carbuncle vaccine for veterinary use: There were 9 labs engaged in the elaboration of anti-carbuncle vaccines, Sterne strain, and they produced 36 755 070 bovine doses, around 7 260 030 more doses than the number produced in 2020; therefore, this constitutes one of the more relevant productions ever.

6. Mandatory bovine vaccination: (a) Alert zone and response, district of Azul, province of Buenos Aires: vaccines were applied to 416 034 bovines of the susceptible category. (b) Province of Buenos Aires: The provisions of law no. 6703/61 resolution MAA115/14 have been in full force and effect since 1 Jan 2021. These provisions state the prohibition to move bovines not vaccinated annually within the provincial territory. In the period from 8 Mar 2021 to 31 Dec 2021, a total of 11 787 396 bovines were vaccinated. (c) Province of Santa Fe: The provisions of ministerial resolution no.1007/2014 are in effect, stating the obligation to vaccinate bovines. It was not possible to obtain information on vaccination in 2021.

7. Cases of human carbuncle countrywide: Since 2018, the National Surveillance Comprehensive Bulletin issued by the National Epidemiological Surveillance System (SINAVE) has no longer reported "human carbuncle cases."

Conclusions:
- There are still isolations of _Bacillus anthracis_ in items of systematized assessment in the provinces of Buenos Aires, La Pampa and Rio Negro.
- Such provinces should enter into sanitary agreements between them in order to control this zoonosis.
- Official monitoring should be implemented on "bovine sudden death cases" in the areas involved, in order to maintain sensitive and effective epidemiological alerts and responses.
- The production and annual application of the anti-carbuncle vaccine, Sterne strain, must keep growing so as to generate hopeful sanitary perspectives with respect to the control of _Bacillus anthracis_ in Argentina.

[The full report has a map of Buenos Aires Province showing the location of the singular outbreak in 2021 [see http://anav.org.ar/producion-cientifica/temas-de-actualidad/].

After decades of hard work, they are within sight of being able to claim that anthrax has been eradicated in Argentina. You are not there until you are there and can claim no outbreaks in 6+ years. And as Ramon points out, one must have an active and responsible effective reporting of unexpected livestock deaths. The spores can lurk for a number of years in the soil, sometimes reinforced by germination and resporalisation. But experience has shown that an absence of outbreaks for some 8 years is a good indication that you are home. Of course, the moment victory is announced some farmer will accidentally dig up an old anthrax grave. Our prayers are with you Ramon and your colleagues. - Mod.MHJ
