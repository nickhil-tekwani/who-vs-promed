The buffer zone created around the hotbed of the anthrax outbreak in the Yamal-Nenets autonomous area has been expanded to 11 000 square km [approx. 4247 square miles], the press office of the region's governor has told TASS.

"The buffer zone around the anthrax outbreak spot has been expanded to 100 km by 110 km (an area of 11 000 sq. km) in order to prevent the further spread of the disease. Vaccination within the security zone will be mandatory. All reindeer will be examined and nomads' health put under control, as follows from what the director of the veterinary department at Russia's Agriculture Ministry, Vladimir Shevkoplias, told a news conference," the press-office said.

According to the authorities, the hotbed itself is much smaller. "Such a large buffer zone was created to be on the safe side. Massive death of livestock has been stopped."

Earlier, TASS said that all reindeer in the Yamal-Nenets autonomous area will be vaccinated against anthrax. "The veterinarians are going to vaccinate against anthrax all reindeer in Yamal, more than 700 000 head all in all, 1st and foremost, the herds in the Yamal district, where the outbreak of the disease has occurred. The Tazovsky and Priuralsky districts are next in line. Not a single case has been registered there, but when biological security is at stake, it is better to take extra precautions," the governor's press-service said.

[It is a major undertaking to vaccinate such a large number of reindeer, easier said than done. Unless you have the right experienced crews and equipment, it can result in significant stress for the reindeer, and this can result in deaths. The Russians have hand-held remote temperature readers suitable for identifying any reindeer running a temperature, so it could be pulled out, blood tested, and treated with a long-acting antibiotic. This is certainly a learning experience for our Russian colleagues, and I can think of a few guys here who would quickly volunteer if asked. - Mod.MHJ]

A blame game has begun on the outbreak of anthrax on the Yamal peninsula, with a senior veterinary watchdog official alleging a huge delay in informing the public and government officials of the lethal disease.

With 23 people now infected and one dead, even health minister Veronika Skvortsova is on antibiotics after visiting patients in Salekhard, it was revealed. She is taking the medicine as a precaution because she had not been vaccinated [totally unnecessary as anthrax is non-contagious - Mod.MHJ].

The main theory as to the cause of the outbreak is that a zombie infection, inactive for 75 years or more in the buried corpse of a human or a reindeer, "awoke" in the recent Arctic heat wave. But now the deputy head of Rosselkhoznadzor, Nikolay Vlasov, claimed the infection was 1st spotted 5 weeks before proper warnings were given. He is demanding the total vaccination of the human and cattle populations to stop the threat of spread.

The senior official from the Federal Service for Veterinary and Phytosanitary Surveillance criticised the "delay in diagnosis for preventing the outbreak of anthrax. YANAO (Yamal) is not the poorest region. But the veterinary service is bad, very weak," he said. "Veterinarians learned about the outbreak of epizootic anthrax 5 weeks after it began. Herders were without reliable communications. One of them had to walk for 4 days across the tundra to report the incident."

His stark criticism contrasts with the words of governor Dmitry Kobylkin who has praised officials for a fast reaction. Vlasov said: "Now they need to burn 150 corpses a day. So far, the bodies have lain in the tundra for 20-to-30 days. The non-vaccination of the animals was the choice of the region's officials, sadly. They have reproduced the threat for generations to come. All this will be preserved in tundra for a long time." He warned: "We, the surveillance services, must consider that the threat of spreading the disease to other regions exists, even if it is not high, and take the measures to prevent it. There [may] be violations. Someone can, of ignorance, take something from the infected area -- skin or meat -- and bring it to another region."

It is already reported that aircraft leaving Yamalo-Nenets are being disinfected, with passengers going through sanitary control. Export of meat from the infected territory has been banned.

The health minister insisted: "There is no threat of anthrax spreading beyond Yamal. The situation is under control, and we hope it soon stabilizes and the outbreak subsides." She said Russia's bio-warfare troops "have started to work. They have reported today [3 Aug 2016] that reindeer carcasses are being disposed in strict compliance with established procedures, with re-checks to prove the absence of _Bacillus anthracis_, the agent of anthrax. Medics from the Emergencies Ministry are also helping us. They have brought 80 multi-bed tents with folding beds, bedding sets, and 80 small stoves to organize a tent camp in a clean zone."

At least 6 of the infected people, among them children, have contracted the virulent intestinal form of the infection which has already killed a 12-year-old boy. They were [infected] after eating contaminated meat, say specialists. In all, 90 people -- including 54 children -- are in hospital; 23 of these have contracted anthrax.

[A 5-week delay in reporting this outbreak -- whether the delay was in processing the samples or issuing the report or both, and responding is unclear -- would explain the extraordinary number of reindeer said to have died. And remember that communications in this region are poor to begin with: "Herders were without reliable communications. One of them had to walk for 4 days across the tundra to report the incident." And then walk for 4 days to get back.

Not only was the Health Minister all gowned up: There is also a picture of Governor Dmitry Kobylkin talking to a bunch of adults and children also wearing a gown and hair cover. Gives a great impression! Reminds me of the time a laundry in Frederick found itself processing some contaminated overalls from USAMRIID. The lab sent 2 people down to bring the overalls back, and they were in full high-level biosecurity. And what does this tell the locals? Nothing very positive.

The Russians are treating this as a high level biosecurity risk. Fair enough for training purposes, but the reality of this epidemic is that it is just a normal farm outbreak writ large. The risk is more from the mud on your boots than anything you might (note "might") breathe. Wear disposable gloves while handling carcasses.

Whether each of the 23 hospital cases has been laboratory confirmed is not clear. That they all have displayed clinical symptoms is more likely. While 8 were earlier said to be confirmed, one must doubt this for later cases, as they would have been on antibiotics prior to symptoms appearing and sampling. Originally, there were 63 people in the affected village, but where the other 27 have come from is unclear, possibly a nearby village. There is still much to be learned from this incident. - Mod.MHJ
