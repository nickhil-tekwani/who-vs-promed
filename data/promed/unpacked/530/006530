A harmful bacterium previously thought to live only in sheep and goats has been found in additional animals, including Alaska caribou and moose, according to a new study announced last week [week of 11 Jun 2018] by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game.

The study was also the first to link the _Mycoplasma ovipneumoniae_ bacteria (_M. ovi_) to respiratory disease in Alaska wildlife. A caribou from the Fortymile Herd east of Fairbanks that carried the bacteria died from pneumonia last month [May 2018].

In addition to being found in Alaska moose and caribou, _M. ovi_ has infected a mule deer in New Mexico, a bison in Montana, and multiple white-tailed deer in the upper Midwest, the study stated.

Fairbanks-based wildlife veterinarian Dr Kimberlee Beckmen, with the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, was a co-author of the study, which is in review for publication in a scientific journal, according a news release from the department.

_M. ovi_ has increasingly been on the radar of Alaska's wildlife biologists. The bacteria are blamed for contributing to bighorn sheep die-offs in the Lower 48 [US states]. It had been known to exist in domestic sheep and goats in the 49th state [Alaska; the 50th state is Hawaii]. But it wasn't confirmed in wild Alaska sheep and goats until March [2018].

Hunting groups, including the national Wild Sheep Foundation, have called for mandatory testing of domestic animals out of concern about the health of wild herds.

Moose and caribou vastly outnumber sheep in Alaska and live in habitat more accessible to hunters. So an infection that could sicken these animals stands to affect far more people.

_M. ovi_ can infect animals without any noticeable effects but can also contribute to their deaths by impairing the ability of their lungs to clear out other harmful bacteria. _M. ovi_'s virulence varies depending on both the strain that infects the animal and the overall health of the animal. In addition to being infected with the bacteria, the Fortymile caribou that died last month [May 2018] was emaciated. The 18 wild sheep and goats previously found with the bacteria in Alaska were all in good health.

Biologists found the _M. ovi_ in 5 of 230 moose tested and 6 of 243 caribou tested. It was also found in 13 of 136 Dall sheep tested and 5 of 39 mountain goats.

Alaska's state government is working with the Washington Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory and the United States Department of Agriculture Animal Disease Research Unit to continue studying _M. ovi_.

[In northwestern USA, _Mycoplasma ovipneumoniae_ is implicated in wild ovid pneumonia outbreaks, mainly in big horn sheep, and recently in Alaskan ungulates such as Dall sheep and mountain goats. _M. ovipneumoniae_ is an exotic disease agent for North America, introduced by domestic ovids. The normal host range of _M. ovipneumoniae_ are members of Old World Caprinae, including domestic sheep. Many observations that outbreaks of bighorn sheep pneumonia frequently follows contact with these hosts. Experiments in which bighorn sheep were commingled with domestic sheep resulted in bighorn sheep pneumonia and high death rates. Similar commingling experiments with other ungulates (deer, elk, llamas, horses, cattle, goats, mountain goats) resulted at most in sporadic deaths from pneumonia. What might result from exposure of this pathogen to natural populations of other ungulates, such as Dall sheep, mountain goat, moose and caribou is unknown and the surveillance efforts implemented are warranted.

This finding in new wild ungulate species from Alaska infected by _M. ovi_ is a concern for wild ungulate conservation and livestock health. - Mod.PMB
