Data as of 12 May 2021, World Health Organization

- The GPEI has released the 2021 National Emergency Action Plan (NEAP) for Afghanistan, which contains the current epidemiology and situational overview and progress on the 2020 NEAP among other contents.

- The latest issue of the new special magazine features an article titled "Experience in eradicating polio helps COVID-19 response," which details the role that polio workers have played in fighting the pandemic. The article is available here on page 34.

- Last week, the GPEI and UN Foundation together with the UK and UAE Missions to the UN in New York hosted a high-level dialogue looking at the intersection of gender and immunization. The panelists made recommendations on championing women & girls in immunization, drawing on the polio programme. Watch the recorded discussion here.

[The continued detection of VDPV2 positive environmental samples in Afghanistan, Sierra Leone and Tajikistan is worrisome. It appears as though the challenges of the circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses (cVDPVs) continue into 2021. At the risk of being repetitive, perhaps the time has come to seriously consider IPV.

Four African countries -- Benin, Burkina Faso, Liberia, and Yemen -- reported new polio cases this week, all involving vaccine-derived strains, according to the latest weekly update from the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI).

Three of the 4 countries reported circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2). Benin reported one case from Northern province, marking its 1st of 2021. So far, all of its cases are linked to Nigeria's Jigawa outbreak. Burkina Faso also reported one more case, which involves a patient from Bobo and is counted in the country's 2020 total, now at 62. The country is experiencing different outbreaks, including ones linked to events in Nigeria and Togo. Also, Liberia reported a cVDPV2 case from Bong county, its 2nd so far.

Meanwhile, Yemen reported a circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (cVDPV1) case, which affected a patient from Saadah, bringing the total so far this year [2021] to 2.

[Wild poliovirus (WPV) is the most commonly known form of the poliovirus. However, there is another form of polio that can spread within communities: circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus, or cVDPV.

While cVDPVs are rare, they have been increasing in recent years due to low immunization rates within communities. cVDPV type 2s (cVDPV2) are the most prevalent, with 959 cases occurring globally in 2020.

It is important to understand that VDPVs can only occur when population immunity is very low and a population is left susceptible to poliovirus, whether from vaccine-derived or wild poliovirus. In a population with low immunity, the vaccine virus shed by a child who has been given OPV can pass between children who have not received the vaccine and can mutate along the way. In seriously under-immunized populations, the virus can continue to mutate for a long period of time and regain its ability to paralyze. Hence, the problem is not with the vaccine itself, but low vaccination coverage. If a population is fully immunized, they will be protected against both vaccine-derived and wild polioviruses.

Notably, since the African Region was declared to have interrupted transmission of the wild poliovirus in August 2020, cVDPVs are now the only form of the poliovirus that affects the African Region.

The polio vaccine protects children, whether the kind of polio is wild poliovirus or vaccine-derived poliovirus. Outbreaks (whether WPV or cVDPV) are usually rapidly stopped with 2-3 rounds of high-quality supplementary immunization activities (immunization campaigns).

In addition to high-quality immunization campaigns, the GPEI is working to deploy an improved outbreak response tool: the novel oral polio vaccine type 2, or nOPV2. This vaccine is similar to mOPV2 (the monovalent oral polio vaccine type 2), the current outbreak response vaccine that is used when cVDPV type 2 outbreaks occur. However, it contains improvements that help make the vaccine virus less likely to mutate and cause disease in communities with low immunization rates, meaning that it can help reduce the risk of cVDPV2 outbreaks; https://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-prevention/the-virus/vaccine-derived-polio-viruses/. - Mod.UBA]
