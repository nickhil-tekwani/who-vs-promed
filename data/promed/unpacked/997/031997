Ebola outbreak feared in Congo
------------------------------
In the north of Congo-Brazzaville, 16 people have died in a suspected
outbreak of Ebola virus infection. The Congolese authorities say they are
extremely concerned that the virus might spread. There is no cure for Ebola
and little is known about the virus, which causes its victims to die from
internal hemorrhaging.
The Congolese Ministry of Health says 16 people are known to have died so
far, but communications with the villages of Kele and Mbou, 800 kilometers
north of Brazzaville in the Region of Cuvette West, are difficult. Dr
Joseph Mboussa, director in the Ministry of Health, says a villager has
been dying every few days since the outbreak began on 4 January, and
already the death toll could be much higher than 16.
The authorities were first alerted to a possible outbreak when a clan of
gorillas in the Cuvette West Region began to die. Tests carried out on the
bodies confirmed that the gorillas had died from the Ebola virus, and the
disease has now claimed more than 80 per cent of the gorilla clan.
Medical professionals are at great risk of contracting Ebola. The Ebola
virus is easily spread just by skin contact with an infected primate or
person. Dr Mboussa says this makes the virus particularly difficult to
contain, as Congolese funeral rites dictate that the body of a deceased
person be washed by the family before burial. The current outbreak is
believed to have been caused by villagers eating primates which were
already infected with Ebola.
An emergency team of health ministry workers was scheduled to leave for the
region on Wednesday to investigate the outbreak and try to contain it,
following delays caused by a shortage of petrol and funds for the trip.
Ebola experts working for the World Health Organization in Libreville and
Geneva also expect to leave soon to investigate the outbreak. Some years
ago in the neighboring Democratic Republic of Congo, then President Mobutu
Sese Seko adopted a controversial policy of putting an infected village in
quarantine. The Ebola virus was contained but the entire village was wiped
out. The Congolese health ministry has so far asked local inhabitants not
to travel, but the authorities are hopeful they will not have to resort to
such drastic measures.
The forestry ministry already has several teams in place trying to make
locals aware of the dangers of eating primates, but they admit it is a
losing battle in a region where bush meat has formed a staple part of
people's diets for centuries.

[This is the same general region (Cuvette West) where the last Ebola
outbreak in the Congo Rep occurred in 2002. If Ebola is confirmed as the
etiology of this outbreak, it will not be the first human outbreak that
occurred coincident/following an observed outbreak in primates in this
region. As this newswire mentions, primate meat is part of the local diet
in this region. The preparation of infected primates for food source is the
most likely vehicle for transmission of the Ebola virus to the humans.
Given this, the occurrence of primate die-offs in known Ebola regions
should trigger increased efforts to alert the local population of the
increased risks involved with eating primates. But as the last sentence of
the above newswire suggests this is clearly easier said than done. - Mod.MPP]
