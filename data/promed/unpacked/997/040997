China's agriculture ministry has found more [outbreaks] of African swine fever [ASF] in Beijing, adding to the more than 70 [outbreaks] already found across the country since August [2018].

In the latest case, some 85 of 9835 [susceptible] hogs were infected and 17 died in the capital's Tongzhou district, Beijing Business Daily reported, citing the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs. Other infected pigs were also found in Xi'an, Shaanxi province [see comment below] and at a wild boar farm up north in Heilongjiang.

It is the 2nd discovery of the epidemic in Beijing over the past few weeks, after 2 farms in Fangshan district were found to be infected on 23 Nov 2018. Other cases have been found in Tianjin, Jiangxi, Hubei, Inner Mongolia and other cities during the same period, as the ministry's website shows.

The speed at which the virus is spreading should slow down, according to Li Guoxiang, a researcher at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, which should prevent the price of pork falling further and stop more farms from closing their doors.

At 20:00 on 2 Dec 2018, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs received a report from China's Center for Animal Disease Control and Prevention, that ASF was investigated and diagnosed by the China Center for Animal Health and Epidemiology (National Center for Animal Disease Research) on a farm in Xi'an district, Shaanxi province. Out of the 245 pigs on the farm, 205 were clinically affected and 79 died.

A new outbreak has been identified on a pig farm in Tongzhou district of Beijing. Out of the 9835 pigs on the farm, 85 were clinically affected and 17 died.

ASF has also been diagnosed on a wild pig farm in Heilongjiang, where out of the 375 wild boars 77 died. Immediately after the outbreak, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs sent an investigation group to the local area. The local government has started the emergency response mechanism as required, and adopted measures such as blockade, culling, harmless treatment, disinfection, etc., to treat all the sick and culled pigs humanely. At the same time, all pigs (captive/domestic wild boars) and their products are prohibited from being transferred out of the blockade, and pigs are prohibited from being transported into the blockade. At present, the above measures have been implemented.

[The 2 reports above include 2 issues of underlined significance:

1. Shaanxi has become China's 21st province/autonomous region/municipality infected by ASF; the virus currently circulates throughout most of China's territory. The other 20 ASF-infected regions are the provinces of Anhui, Fujian, Guizhou, Heilongjiang, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Jilin, Liaoning, Shanxi, Sichuan, Yunnan, and Zhejiang; the municipalities Tianjin, Chongqing, Shanghai, and Beijing; and the autonomous region Inner Mongolia.

Shaanxi is officially part of the Northwest China region and borders the provinces of Shanxi (NE, E), Henan (E), Hubei (SE), Chongqing (S), Sichuan (SW), Gansu (W), Ningxia (NW), and Inner Mongolia (N); of these, only the 2 provinces western to Shaanxi, namely Gansu and Ningxia, have so far not reported ASF. For the location of Shaanxi, see map at https://goo.gl/maps/19MyFnKmvRz.

2. The report of ASF on a wild boar farm, in Heilongjiang (a north-eastern province bordering Russia; see map at https://goo.gl/maps/ysdFHijKdoy) is of particular interest. So far, only one event involving an apparently single wild boar was reported in China, as reported in 2 postings dated 17 and 18 Nov 2018 (20181117.6151273 and 20181116.6149559). This case took place in Jilin, bordering North Korea on its south and the province Heilongjiang on its north. This case is yet to be reported to the OIE.

China's wild boar population and its potential ASF hazards were discussed in FAO's assessment document, published in early 2018 (ref 1, pages 8 & 10). The current event relates, reportedly, to a "wild pig farm". A brief literature search brought up the possible dimensions of such production line in China, indicative of serious potential ramifications. According to the paper by Bai et al (ref 2), the number of free-range farmed wild boars raised, foraging on mountain pasture in 3 Northeastern Chinese cities in Jilin province, between April 2015 and February 2016, was 500 000 farmed wild boars. It will be of importance to note if such enterprises exist elsewhere in China and what measures have/will be undertaken to separate these populations from free roaming wild boars.
