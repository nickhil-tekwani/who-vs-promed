The 1st report of Tomato torrado virus in Poland
------------------------------------------------
In 2003 and 2004, unusual disease symptoms, including severe
stunting, malformation, and necrosis of the leaves on tomato cv.
Grace, were observed in the Wielkopolska [Greater Poland] Region of
Poland. The disease appeared to be associated with the presence of
the greenhouse whitefly _Trialeurodes vaporariorum_.

An electron microscopic examination showed the presence of spherical
virus particles approximately 25 to 28 nanometers in diameter. The
virus (designated Wal'03) was shown to be vectored efficiently (100
percent) by _T. vaporariorum_ and poorly (50 to 70 percent) by
mechanical transmission to tomato. Mechanical inoculation or whitefly
transmission caused systemic infection on a number of hosts,
including tomato, capsicum, and potato. Viral RNA analysis revealed
RNA1 (approximately 7800 basepairs) and RNA2 (approximately 5400 bp).

The biological properties and the genomic RNA composition showed
significant similarities to that of tomato necrotic dwarf virus
(ToNDV) described from California (1) and the newly identified tomato
torrado virus (ToTV) in Spain (2). Wal'03 virus particles reacted
with ToNDV antiserum. Fragments from Wal'03 were sequenced and
comparisons with ToTV showed 99 and 98 percent nucleotide identity
for RNA1 and RNA2, respectively. The similarity of the symptoms on
tomato plants, the morphology of virus particles, genome composition
and nucleotide sequence identities suggest that Wal'03 and ToTV are
the same.

[ToTV is a new virus, which appears to be spreading. Symptoms of leaf
necrosis affect the photosynthetic potential of the host and
therefore may result in considerable yield loss. ToTV was suspected
to be transmitted by whiteflies, and the results reported above have
now identified _T. vaporariorum_ as an efficient vector.

Virus particles are isometric with a diameter of approximately 28
nanometers. The viral genome consists of 2 positive strand
single-stranded RNA molecules of 7793 (RNA1) and 5389 (RNA2)
nucleotides. The RNAs are encapsidated by 3 proteins with estimated
sizes of 35, 26, and 23 kDa. Phylogenetic analyses of nucleotide and
derived amino acid sequences showed that the virus is related to, but
distinct from, viruses belonging to the genera _Sequivirus_,
_Sadwavirus_, and _Cheravirus_ in the proposed order of the
Picornavirales. ToTV most likely represents a member of a new plant
virus genus.

ToNDV (?) is a poorly characterised virus reported in 1984 as a new
type of virus transmitted by whiteflies (_Bemisia tabaci_). It is not
listed by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV).
The cross-reaction of ToNDV antibodies with ToTV particles as
reported above may point towards some degree of relatedness between
these 2 viruses.

Whiteflies are both insect pests capable of reducing plant
productivity and longevity, and virus vectors. The only whitefly
genus other than _Bemisia_ identified as a virus vector is
_Trialeurodes_. In contrast to the large numbers of viruses (genera
_Begomovirus_, _Carlavirus_, _Ipomovirus_, _Crinivirus_) transmitted
by _Bemisia_, only a handful of viruses have been found to be
transmitted by _Trialeurodes_, all within the genus _Crinivirus_.
ToTV appears to be the 1st virus from a different genus reported for
this vector.
