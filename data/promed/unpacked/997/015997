[1] China: Confirmation that 1st human case occurred in 2003

China on Tuesday [8 Aug 2006] confirmed
[officially] that a man died of avian influenza
in 2003, 2 years before the country reported its 1st human case of the disease.
A 24-year-old soldier became ill in November
2003, and the Health Ministry said in a statement
on its Web site that it has �confirmed the case as H5N1.
The death was first disclosed in June [2006] in a
letter by Chinese researchers to a U.S. medical
journal. It raised questions about whether China
failed to detect, or failed to report, an early human infection of bird flu.
The fatality came 2 years before China reported
its 1st bird flu death, but just a few months
before the virus tore through Viet Nam and Thailand.

(90): China 20060629.1800" for an account of the
background to this report in the 22 Jun 2006
issue of the New England Journal of Medicine by a
group of independent Chinese research workers, of
a case of H5N1 avian influenza in a Chinese
patient dating back to 2003. It was treated with
some scepticism initially, particularly as the
original report was retracted by the authors, and
the retraction later withdrawn. The Chinese
Ministry of Health began a reinvestigation and
the above report indicates that the Chinese
authorities now accept the authenticity of the
original research and have now officially confirmed the results. - Mod.CP/JW]

China: Avian Influenza Situation - WHO Update 13
------------------------------------------------
As of 8 Aug 2006, The Ministry of Health in China
has today retrospectively confirmed a human case
of H5N1 infection dating back to November 2003.
The case occurred in a 24-year-old member of the
military service based in Beijing. The man
developed symptoms on 25 Nov 2003 and was
hospitalized with pneumonia in Beijing. His
condition deteriorated rapidly and he died of
severe respiratory disease on 3 Dec 2003.
Confirmation of this case marks the earliest
known instance of human H5N1 infection in
mainland China, and is now the 1st confirmed case
in the present outbreak. Previously, the 1st
confirmed cases were thought to have occurred in Viet Nam in December 2003.
The case was initially reported by several
Chinese researchers, affiliated with the military
services, in a June 2006 letter to the New
England Journal of Medicine. According to that
communication, doctors initially suspected the
man might have been infected with the SARS virus.
Although WHO declared the SARS outbreak over in
July 2003, suspicions were high that the virus
might return during the cooler months.
Specimens tested for SARS infection prior to the
man's death were negative, but the cause of death
remained undetermined. As stated in the published
letter, stored specimens from the man
subsequently tested positive for H5N1 infection.
Successful isolation of the virus from these specimens was also reported.
As the man's illness was initially thought to be
SARS, no history of possible poultry exposure was
taken. The source of his H5N1 infection remains
uncertain, particularly as no poultry outbreaks
of H5N1 avian influenza have been reported in Beijing.
The Ministry of Health informed WHO that it had
been unaware of these tests and their results
prior to publication of the research letter. In
line with WHO recommendations, confirmatory
testing in a laboratory affiliated with the
Ministry of Health was arranged. Following an
official request, WHO sent laboratory experts to
consult with national experts performing the
tests. That joint undertaking, conducted in late
July, confirmed the man's infection with the H5N1
virus. These findings were further reviewed by a
panel of experts, which concluded that the man's
H5N1 infection was now laboratory-confirmed.
Prior to this announcement, the 1st official
laboratory-confirmed H5N1 case on the Chinese
mainland occurred in Hunan Province in October
2005 and was reported to WHO in mid-November 2005.
The case has been added to the WHO cumulative
table of confirmed cases. Retrospective
confirmation of the case brings the cumulative
total in China to 20. Of these cases, 13 have been fatal.
The Ministry of Health has informed WHO of its
intention to strengthen communication mechanisms,
and to ensure that more of the country�s research
institutes are integrated into the reporting
system. WHO will be providing support and
guidance in these activities, as officially requested.

[3] Indonesia: Indonesia: death toll increases

Two Indonesian teenagers have died of the bird
flu virus, bringing the country's number of human
fatalities to 44, Indonesian health officials
say. [The test result for the female teenager
has yet to be confirmed by a 2nd laboratory and
still ranks as a suspected case. - Mod.CP]
The test results, if confirmed, would give
Indonesia the world's highest human toll from the
virus. Local tests showed a 16-year-old boy died
of the disease on Monday night [This case was
reported as confirmed in ProMED-mail post: Avian
influenza, human (114): Indonesia, Thailand
20060807.2209. - Mod.CP] and tests were also
positive for a girl who died on Tuesday [8 Aug 2006], officials said.
Indonesia has registered more bird flu deaths
this year than any other nation. Viet Nam has
also been badly affected, suffering 42 deaths,
but the outbreak there seems to be under control.
No one has died from the disease in Viet Nam since the beginning of 2006.
Indonesia has recently changed the way it
confirms human bird flu deaths with the World
Health Organisation. In the past, samples were
tested at a WHO-affiliated laboratory before
official confirmation was given. But now, if 2
national laboratories confirm the presence of the
virus, it is officially classified as a bird flu death and the WHO is informed.
The presence of H5N1 in the 2 most recent
patients has currently been confirmed by one
laboratory. Officials said the 16-year-old girl
was admitted to hospital on 4 Aug 2006 in
Tangerang, west of Jakarta, but died before she
could be transferred to the capital.
The teenage boy came from Bekasi on the outskirts
of Jakarta. He was admitted to the city's
designated bird flu centre, Sulianti Suroso
hospital, on Saturday, and his condition rapidly
deteriorated. Health officials said he had been
in contact with sick chickens before he contracted the disease.
Indonesia's problems were highlighted in May when
the country recorded a large cluster of deaths
which the WHO believes were the result of
human-to-human transmission. But experts say this
particular incident did not signal a major change
in the spread of the disease. Indonesia has often
been criticized for its reluctance to cull large
numbers of fowl -- a method that has proved effective in other nations.
But the disease is endemic in poultry across most
of the country, and the government says it is
simply not practical to initiate such a
widespread cull. It also says it does not have
enough money to compensate farmers, and has asked
for $900 million (GBP 495 million) over the next 3 years to tackle the virus.
Globally, more than 130 people have died of bird
flu since late 2003. Most of the deaths have been
in East Asia, but the virus has also spread to
Europe, Africa and South and Central Asia.

Indonesia: Avian influenza Situation - WHO Update 24
----------------------------------------------------
As of 8 Aug 2006, The Ministry of Health in
Indonesia has confirmed the country's 55th case
of human infection with the H5N1 avian influenza
virus. The case occurred a 16-year-old male from
West Java Province. He developed symptoms on 26
Jul, was hospitalized on 4 Aug, and died on 7 Aug 2006.
Prior to symptom onset, the case had contact with
sick and dying chickens in his household. A joint
investigation by health and agricultural
officials detected the H5 virus subtype in
chickens from the household. Family members and
close contacts have been placed under surveillance.
Of the 55 cases confirmed to date in Indonesia, 43 have been fatal.

[5] Thailand: dengue diagnosis not confirmed
Date: Tue 8 Aug 2006

[It was originally reported that a teenage boy
had tested positive for both avian influenza
virus and dengue virus infection; see ProMED-mail
post entitled, "Avian influenza, human (102):
Thailand, dengue exposure
20060726.2060". Reinvestigation has failed to
confirm the initial finding. - Mod.CP]
That the teenage boy who became Thailand's 1st
fatality from bird flu in 2006 wasn't also
infected with dengue hemorrhagic fever as
diagnosed, the Nation reported
[<http://etna.mcot.net/query.php?nid=23916>]
citing Public Health Minister Pinij Charusombat.
Results of laboratory tests released yesterday
showed no sign of dengue, the English-language daily newspaper reported.
Dengue, a potentially fatal mosquito-borne
infection endemic in Thailand, was initially
blamed for the youth's illness. The patient was
found to have the H5N1 avian influenza strain
after he died, and health officials said he might
have been infected with both viruses at the time of his death on 24 Jul 2006.
Thailand confirmed 2 deaths from H5N1 during the
past 2 weeks, taking the total number of human
infections reported in the Southeast nation to 24, of which 16 were fatal.
