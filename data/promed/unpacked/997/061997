Cluster of trichinellosis cases in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Germany
-------------------------------
Seventeen cases of trichinellosis were detected among members of an
extended family living in the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, eastern
Germany between December 2005 and March 2006.
On 21 Mar 2006, health authorities in the district were notified of a
laboratory diagnosed case of trichinellosis. The patient, a 30 year old
woman, had been admitted to hospital on 22 Feb 2006 with diarrhoea, nausea,
fever, facial swelling, and muscle pain. The patient's blood was tested for
IgG and IgM antibodies to trichinella as part of the differential
diagnosis, using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
Trichinella larvae were found in a muscle biopsy using immunoflourescence
microscopy. The local health and veterinary authorities suspected that pork
from a home-reared pig that had been slaughtered at a local butcher's was
the source of infection. On 23 Mar, a 2nd case was notified in the
mother-in-law of the first patient. The 2nd patient had first become ill in
December 2005 with unexplained diarrhoea, nausea, fever, facial swelling,
and muscle pain, and was admitted to hospital for 2 weeks. After the
identification of the illness in her daughter-in-law, she was again
admitted to hospital from 21-27 Mar 2006 and trichinella larvae were
identified in the remainder of a frozen muscle biopsy specimen taken in
December 2005. The diagnosis was confirmed by serology.
After exchanging information between veterinary and local government
authorities, and the Federal Authority for Risk Assessment, the local
health authorities contacted 22 people who had all consumed meat and meat
products (raw minced pork, uncooked smoked sausage or Mettwurst, and ham or
liver sausage) made from the suspect pork flesh. Blood samples from 17 of
these people tested positive for trichinella infection using ELISA; 16 also
had clinical symptoms of trichinellosis: 12 had muscle pain and facial or
joint swelling, and 10 had diarrhoea. Fifteen of these patients were
admitted to hospital for treatment. On 20 Apr, a further case of
trichinellosis was identified in a 42 year old man, a neighbour of the
affected family. The man had also consumed smoked sausage made from the
pork from the neighbour's pig. He presented with neurological symptoms
including visual disturbances, a suspected stroke due to vasculitis, and
peripheral weakness in all limbs. He was treated in a neurological
rehabilitation centre. One serologically confirmed case had no clinical
symptoms. Four people who consumed the implicated meat did not develop
suspect symptoms, and their serology was negative. The newborn child of a
mother with trichinellosis also tested negative.
Some bacon left over from the implicated pig was examined for
trichinellosis using the digestion method. A high density of trichinella
larvae was identified (106 larvae per gram of bacon). These were
characterised with multiplex PCR as _Trichinella spiralis_. Since 1900, it
has been a legal requirement in Germany for commercially slaughtered pigs
and other animals that can harbour trichinella (particuarly wild boar and
horse) to be inspected for the larvae (since 1937 for home-slaughtered
animals). However, there is evidence that this requirement is not always
adhered to, particuarly when the meat is home-slaughtered, is from wild
pigs or is imported. Investigations into how meat from the infected pig was
able to pass safety inspections are continuing. Trichinellosis is a rare
disease in Germany: 5 cases were notified in 2004, and no cases were
notified in 2005.

[Pigs raised in the backyard for a family's own consumption have increased
risk of being infected with trichinella. They are often fed kitchen waste
and slaughter remains and probably have easier access to small rodents than
industry-raised pigs, especially if raised outdoors. As seen in this case,
home-slaughtered animals are also more likely not to be subjected to
veterinary inspection, where the legally required meat inspection would
have picked up the infected meat. - Mod.EP]
