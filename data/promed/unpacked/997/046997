Cambodia has reported that as many as 1793 severe cases of
hemorrhagic dengue fever have been treated in hospital, and 11 of them
have died since early this year [2011]. In a report filed by Kantha
Bopha Children's Hospitals, up to [20 Jun 2011], there were 1793
severe cases of dengue fever, and 547 of them were hospitalized in
Siem Reap Province, 1247 in Phnom Penh. Of the total hospitalized, 11
have died.

Dr Beat Richner, the founder and head of the Kantha Bopha Children's
Hospitals, who has been operating them since 1992, said the sick
children are coming from across the country. He said that some sick
children were hospitalized in private clinics before being sent to his
hospitals. They were previously treated incorrectly, so they arrived
at the hospital with liver and kidney failure.

Beat Richner said among 100 hospitalized dengue fever patients, only
about 30 per cent of their families have gotten Abate [mosquito
larvicide] to treat the water around their houses. The phenomenon
happened not only in local provinces, but also in Phnom Penh.

Kantha Bopha Children's Hospitals are believed to be the most trusted
hospitals for children in Cambodia.

Major outbreaks of dengue fever strike Cambodia every 3-5 years, and
the last one occurred here in 2007, when around 40 000 people were
hospitalized, with over 10 000 in one week.

there were 1924 cases (11 deaths; CFR 0.6 per cent), which is an
increase of 40 per cent from 1395 cases (7 deaths) in 2010 for the
same period.

Middle East:
- Saudi Arabia (Jeddah). 4 Jul 2011. The number of dengue fever cases
in Jeddah requiring hospital attention has risen to about 130 a week,

remain unreported are suspected to be much higher. According to
Al-Yawm Arabic daily Monday [4 Jul 2011], many of the 130 weekly cases
have been found in more affluent districts of the city, suggesting
that the mosquitoborne virus is spreading from its usual areas of
proliferation in unplanned [neighborhoods] or downmarket areas.
