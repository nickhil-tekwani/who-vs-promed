An unidentified respiratory disease has killed 8 more people in an eastern
Congo diamond-mining region, pushing the death toll to 29, as the number of
infections topped 1000, reported the Associated Press.
The apparent viral pulmonary illness that causes victims to vomit blood
began spreading in Maniema province in mid-July 2005, and officials said on
8 Aug 2005 that 21 people had already died.
Eustache Bibala, a top government doctor in the area, said that 8 more have
since died and that medical staff have documented 120 new infections,
bringing to 1117 the number of affected.
The illness appears to have originated in a diamond mine and to have been
spread by workers into nearby communities, said Jean-Baptiste Shuli
Tchomba, another high-ranking health official in the region.
The mine, near Punia, 280 km west of the border town of Goma, has about 10
000 employees, aid workers said earlier.

[The last posting on this outbreak remarked about bloody diarrhea, which is
notably absent here. This report remarks about a respiratory illness and
bloody emesis (or perhaps blood in sputum). With a low case fatality rate
(about 2.6 percent), pneumonia plague and the filovirus infections are
unlikely. We await more information regarding the etiology of this illness.
