Scrapie fears lead to cull of 800 sheep in Manitoba
---------------------------------------------------
About 800 sheep were destroyed in Manitoba and monitoring continues to
prevent the spread of scrapie, a fatal disease that attacks the central
nervous system of sheep and goats. Most of the 800 sheep, which were
slaughtered before Christmas, were from 2 flocks in southeastern Manitoba.
A few other sheep that were purchased from those flocks were also
destroyed, said George Luterbach of the Canadian Food Inspection Agency.
"Animals that were sold to other sources are all being analyzed to indicate
whether they might have the infection."
Earlier last year, a flock near Roblin, Manitoba, was also found to have
scrapie. That flock was destroyed and the infection was traced to one of
the 2 flocks in southeastern Manitoba.
Scrapie, a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE), is a reportable
disease under the federal Health of Animals Act. It is the equivalent of
BSE in cattle and chronic wasting disease in deer and elk. The producers
who owned the sheep eradicated last month are being compensated, said
Luterbach [D/Western Canada Agency, Canadian Food Inspection Agency. The
compensation amounts to about $200 per animal.

they succeed, there will be an initial burst in reports of identified
affected flocks. - MHJ
