Nelspruit. There is no indication that the cholera epidemic in Maputo,
Mozambique,
has spread to Mpumalanga yet, the province's deputy director for
environmental health,
Len Mdhluli, said on Wednesday.
Mdhluli said his department had monitored water sources and sewerage plants
in Mpumalanga since it first heard about the cholera outbreak in early
August, but that none of the samples had proved positive.
"We've taken samples from all the areas bordering Mozambique, and even as
far west as White River where illegal Mozambicans had been detected," said
Mdhluli. "So far, all the samples have been negative," he said.
He said if infected Mozambicans entering South Africa either legally or
illegally and
were infected with cholera, they could not be deported or summarily turned
back.
"By sending them back, we're not solving the problem," explained Mdhluli.
He said
infected border crossers would first have to be tested and treated.
The officer in charge of immigration at the Lebombo border post in
Komatipoort, Isabel
Badenhorst, said none of the people crossing into South Africa thus far
appeared to
have the symptoms of cholera.
She said the cholera outbreak, being largely limited to Maputo, had also
not reduced
the number of South Africans visiting Mozambique.
"We still have about 4 000 people crossing into Mozambique everyday," she
said. She
said areas north of Maputo were not infected and that the latest reports
from the
Mozambican consulate in Nelspruit indicated that the epidemic had been
brought under
control.
"I still wouldn't eat seafood in Maputo though," she said. She added that
as a safety measure, it would, however, be wise for all Mozambicans
entering South Africa to be given cholera injections. She said South
Africans entering Mozambique should boil water and cook vegetables, rather
than eat them raw.
