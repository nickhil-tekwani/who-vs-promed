EPPO Report 2001/025 - Begomoviruses of tomato in Nicaragua
---------------------------------------------------------
Since the mid-1980s, significant yield losses due to whitefly-transmitted
viruses have been noted in vegetable crops of Central America, particularly
in bean (_Phaseolus vulgaris_ and tomato _Lycopersicon esculentum_.) In
Nicaragua diseases caused by whitefly-transmitted viruses were observed [at
low incidence in the tomato-growing area of Tisma in the 1970s. In the
early 1980s, these diseases also appeared in Sebaco valley, in association
with high populations of whiteflies. In 1998, [all tomato crops in Sebaco
valley and other regions of the country [were affected by drastic yield
reductions. At the end of the 1990s, tomato production virtually vanished
from Nicaragua. After hurricane Mitch, whitefly-transmitted viruses were
[temporarily suppressed, probably because [of low whitefly populations.
But in 1999, whitefly populations increased again and [all tomato fields
were infected, showing various types of symptoms (yellow mottling,
crinkling, curling, severe stunting).
Tomato samples were collected from August 1998 to January 1999 from 9
locations (11 fields) representing the major tomato-growing regions of
Nicaragua. [Begomoviruses were found in all symptomatic plants from all
regions of the country. DNA sequence analysis and comparison with other
begomovirus occurring in the Americas showed that 4 different begomoviruses
could be distinguished. No mixed infections were found.
[A virus showing 97-99% similarity to Sinaloa tomato leaf curl
begomovirus [STLCV (EPPO Alert List) was found in 3 different regions.
STLCV occurs in Costa Rica and Mexico and its [likely presence in
Nicaragua [suggests that this virus is probably widespread in Central
America. Additionally, 2 other viruses presented 92% and 94% sequence
similarity with sida golden mosaic and tomato leaf crumple begomoviruses,
respectively. A fourth virus was closely related to a tomato-infecting
virus from Honduras, and tentatively [named tomato mild mottle virus.

[There are at least 15 different geminiviruses infecting tomato in the
Western Hemisphere. This report illustrates the complexity of geminivirus
diseases infecting tomato in Nicaragua. Moreover, these viruses
undoubtedly infect other crops and wild species, thus providing
opportunities for evolution of new strains. Surprisingly, no mixed
infections, seemingly a prerequisite for such evolution, were observed in
tomato. Perhaps mixed infections in other solanaceous crops or wild hosts
may provide better opportunities for viral evolution. - Mod.DH
