Himachal Pradesh has witnessed 28 deaths due to scrub typhus during the last 2 months. It is not exactly the disease, but the delayed treatment, which is killing people, as scrub typhus can be cured by a doxycycline tablet.

One more patient died of scrub typhus on Tuesday [9 Oct 2012], taking the total count so far to 28. The deaths have also exposed lack of health facilities in Himachal Pradesh. Surprisingly, improving health infrastructure does not figure in the poll agenda of parties even in an election year, while the election campaign noise has suppressed the cries of families, who have lost their dear ones.

Over 1000 positive cases have been detected in the state so far, of which around 440 cases were reported at Indira Gandhi Medical College and Hospital, Shimla, with over 255 positive cases reported from Dr Rajendra Prasad Medical College and Hospital, Tanda, in Kangra.

While opposition Congress is blaming the BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] government for failing to take timely remedial measures, the government on its part is claiming that required steps have been taken to deal with the spread of scrub typhus. Health officials themselves have admitted that IgM [immunoglobulin M) ELISA [enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay] test to confirm the disease is available only at 2 medical colleges, while tests done at district level [probably referring to the Weil-Felix test] are not specific [Coleman RE, Sangkasuwan V, Suwanabun N, et al. Comparative evaluation of selected diagnostic assays for the detection of IgG and IgM antibody to _Orientia tsutsugamushi_ in Thailand. Am J Trop Med Hyg. 2002 Nov; 67(5): 497-503; http://www.ajtmh.org/content/67/5/497.long].

"Improving facilities in health sector has remained a non-issue for political parties in Himachal, due to which the situation has worsened in remote rural areas of the state where specialists are not available and people are dependent on paramedical staff for treatment. The situation is worse in tribal areas where doctors avoid postings," said a resident of Hinsa village in Lahaul-Spiti district.

A resident of Sion village in Sirmaur district, said that health facilities in rural areas of Himachal Pradesh are far from better. Around 17 panchayats [local governments] in Renuka dam area, spread over 26 km [16 mi] area, are without a health centre, he said. "Repeated pleas to elected representatives and state governments have fallen on deaf ears. Such is the condition that when a woman suffers labour pain, she has to be taken on a charpoy (cot) to the nearest health centre by walking a distance of 5-10 km [3-6 mi]," he said.

Himachal Pradesh health director DS Chandel said that [Weil-Felix] test done at district level is not an accurate method as they are of screening nature only. IGM ELISA test is available at Tanda and Shimla medical colleges only, he said. "We have instructed block medical officers to give doxycycline tablets to patients suffering with fever as this medicine reacts fast," he said.

Chandel said that majority of cases have been reported from Bilaspur, Chamba, and Shimla districts, but now, a few cases have come from Kinnaur and Dodra Kawar areas also. "We have held a meeting chaired by the [health secretary] to analyse the situation and take remedial measures," he added.

[For a discussion of scrub typhus, see a prior ProMED-mail post on this outbreak: Scrub typhus - India (06): (HP) fatal 20120906.1282795. The total number of cases and the death toll from scrub typhus continues to rise in Himachal Pradesh since the last ProMED-mail posts (Scrub typhus - India (06): (HP) fatal 20120906.1282795 and Scrub typhus - India (08): (HP) fatal, more cases 20120923.1306017).

The Weil-Felix test, an agglutination test for the diagnosis of rickettsial disease, is based on the detection of antibodies to various _Proteus_ species, which contain antigens that cross-react with rickettsial antigens. This test has poor sensitivity and specificity, but continues to be used in resource-poor regions (http://www.japi.org/august2006/O-619.pdf).

Himachal Pradesh is a mountainous state in north western India with an elevation ranging from about 350 meters (1148 feet) to 7000 meters (22 966 feet) above sea level and has one of the highest per capita incomes of any state in India (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himachal_Pradesh).
