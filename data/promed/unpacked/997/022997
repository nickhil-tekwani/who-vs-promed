According to a report by the National Research Centre on Equines (NREC) in Hisar, Haryana, several horses in 2 localities in Delhi -- Mongolpuri and Neb Sarai -- have tested positive for glanders, a fatal equine disease that spreads from animals to humans. The symptoms of glanders in human beings are fever with sweating, muscle ache, chest pain, headache, and nasal discharge, among others, according to the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Without treatment with specific antibiotics, 9 of every 10 people who get glanders die, it said. [For additional information re fatality rate in humans, see commentary. - Mod.AS]

The NREC report, which was submitted to Delhi's animal husbandry department on 7 May [2019], said 8 out of 18 serum samples collected by it tested positive for glanders, a disease that also affects mules and donkeys, among other animals. "In light of this result, it is recommended that equine movement to and from these and adjoining areas should be brought under strict regulation," the report said. "Considering that this is a notifiable disease, necessary precautions and zoo-sanitary measures to prevent the spread of the disease need top priority."

A senior NREC official said: "A lot of these horses are used during marriage ceremonies and can transmit the infection to human beings." The official added the disease is "highly communicable". The outbreak of glanders could happen almost every year in the national capital, he said. ". . . the horses continue to be kept in abysmal conditions, which become breeding ground for infection," he continued.

Last year, Delhi was notified as a controlled area, and the government put a ban on the movement of horses, mules, and donkeys in and out of the city after as many as 40 horses were diagnosed with glanders. "The population of horses kept in Delhi is neither registered, nor (are they) screened regularly, and their indiscriminate use/abuse for commercial purposes as well as interstate transport is rampant," wrote animal rights activist Gauri Maulekhi in a letter sent to Delhi chief secretary Vijay Kumar Dev on Tuesday [28 May 2019]. "This only adds up to the spread of the disease, and the most unfortunate victims could be the unwary public [who are] ignorant to the severe health consequences associated with glanders," she added.

Underscoring the need to make the public aware of the possible outbreak of glanders, Maulekhi further said, "The 18 samples collected from Mongolpuri and Neb Sarai are from horses most commonly used for baraats. The public must be immediately and urgently made aware of the risk of contracting incurable diseases from such use of horses."

[India and Brazil are known to lead the list of countries where glanders, a zoonotic, OIE-listed equid disease, is endemic. According to the OIE records, the annual numbers of reported glanders outbreaks (in equidae) countrywide in India in 2017 (the most recent available annual report) was 106, of which 89 were in Uttar Pradesh. No statistics on the incidence of glanders in humans in India could be obtained.

Glanders is a contagious and fatal disease of horses, donkeys, and mules caused by infection with the bacterium _Burkholderia mallei_. The pathogen causes nodules and ulcerations in the upper respiratory tract and lungs. A skin form, known as "farcy", also occurs. Control of glanders requires testing of suspect clinical cases, screening of apparently normal equids, and elimination of reactors. Glanders is transmissible to humans by direct contact with diseased animals or with infected or contaminated material. In the untreated acute disease, the mortality rate can reach 95% within 3 weeks. However, survival is possible if the infected person is treated early and aggressively with multiple systemic antibiotic therapies. In fact, fatal cases, which were known to be common, have become rather uncommon.

In view of its zoonotic potential, all infected or contaminated (or potentially infected or contaminated) material must be handled in a laboratory with appropriate biosafety and biosecurity controls following a bio-risk analysis.

The above and additional information on glanders, its causative agent, and its diagnosis is available at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/3.05.11_GLANDERS.pdf . A useful updated review on the disease, including its recent global distribution, is available in ref 1.

No vaccine against this disease is available.
