Top Sierra Leonean physician contracts Ebola
--------------------------------------------
Sierra Leone Government Chief Medical Officer Dr. Brima Kargbo confirmed Sun 14 Dec 2014 that Dr VW had tested positive for Ebola. Dr. VW is the 12th Sierra Leonean physician to become infected with Ebola, 10 of whom have died. Doctors and nurses have been especially vulnerable because the disease is spread through direct contact with the bodily fluids of the sick.

Family sources say Dr. VW is stable and responding to treatment so far at the Italian operated brand new Ebola Treatment Center in Goderich, Western Freetown. The center is said to be the best Ebola Treatment Center currently in Sierra Leone and is outfitted with diagnostic and supportive equipment. Dr VW was its 1st patient admitted. Sources say the doctor is stable, conscious and communicating well whilst his family asks for prayers to be offered for his recovery. Dr VW is the 12th Sierra Leonean physician to become infected; 10 others infected in the past have died with only one doctor surviving so far. The Ebola infection has been unrelenting in the Western Area which encompasses Freetown -- 30 new Ebola cases were recorded in the urban capital city in its daily update for yesterday, Sun [14 Dec 2014].

Last week, senior doctors frowned on a strike by junior doctors. It had been launched in protest over alleged mediocre levels of care for health workers infected with Ebola. The junior doctors are still on strike.

[2] Sierra Leone, Liberia: fewer Ebola cases go unreported than thought, study finds

["By looking at virus samples gathered in Sierra Leone and contract-tracing data from Liberia, Yale (USA) scientists working on the new study estimated that about 17 percent of cases in West Africa go unreported, up to a maximum of 70 percent. That is far fewer than earlier estimates." - Mod.JW]

[3] Sierra Leone: post-Ebola problems

Survivors cope with Ebola physical and mental after-effects
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Victims spared by the deadly disease are reporting blindness and other unexpected post-Ebola health issues. MK sat patiently with her brother M, her haunted eyes focused somewhere in the middle distance beyond the walls of the post-Ebola clinic. 3 months earlier, doctors gave her the good news -- after weeks of fighting the disease, she had finally beaten Ebola. She would live. Back in her home neighbourhood of Nyandeyama, a quiet suburb of sandy streets and mango trees, she found out 22 members of her family were dead, including her parents. She had no money, so was unable to go back to her tailoring business, and many of her possessions had been burned by terrified neighbours. Then, just when she thought things couldn't get worse, she began to lose her eyesight....

MK is one of 40 percent of Ebola survivors to have gone on to develop eye problems, according to a recent study carried out by the World Health Organization and Kenema's District Health Management Team. It has been more than a month since the district saw its last case of Ebola, and attention is turning to the plight of survivors. The results of the survey, a copy of which was seen by Al Jazeera, outline a raft of physical, social and psychological problems the survivors are experiencing; 79 percent, for example, now suffer from joint pain; 42 percent have problems sleeping, while more than 1/3rd of those surveyed experienced peeling of the skin. Many others reported problems with their reproductive system....

The head of the hospital's eye department, Ernest Challey, said he believes he has found the cause -- a condition called uveitis that occurs when the innermost coating of the eye becomes inflamed. It is triggered by problems with the immune system, a viral infection, and sometimes trauma, he explained. It leaves patients with dim and blurred vision, and pain when they're in bright light. If left untreated, said Challey, it can lead to blindness.... Of all the survivors Al Jazeera spoke to, the horrifying experience of 38-year-old ZK best exemplifies the problems they face -- though with one bizarre twist. Thinking he was dead, hospital staff had put him in a body bag and thrown him onto a truck that was to take him off to be buried. British nurse Will Pooley, himself now an Ebola survivor and the only British citizen to have contracted the disease, had noticed movement from the bag and opened it to find Konneh still alive.... -- more
