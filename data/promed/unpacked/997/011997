Bird Flu Outbreaks Appear Across Indonesia
------------------------------------------
Although the spread of bird flu has slowed in most countries, outbreaks
have appeared across Indonesia, where government resources are stretched
thin in the fight against the disease, a United Nations agency said Monday.

The virus has extended its range in southern Sumatra, while West Kalimantan
recently became the latest province to be infected with the avian
influenza, the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) said in a
statement. It said the disease is strongly suspected to have also spread
to Lombok, Sumbawa, Flores, and West Timor.

"Given the current state of avian influenza in the country, and the limited
resources available to fully implement the control strategy, the disease is
likely to continue circulating for several months," the FAO said.

8 Asian countries have been battling a severe form of the avian influenza
virus, and about 100 million chickens have either died from the illness or
been slaughtered since December 2003. The virus has jumped to humans only
in Viet Nam and Thailand, where a total of 24 people have died.

Although some Asian countries have said their outbreaks are coming under
control, international health officials have repeatedly warned that the
Asia bird flu crisis isn't yet over.

Hans Wagner, the FAO's senior animal production and health officer in
Bangkok, told The Associated Press that the virus does seem to be slowing
down in most countries. The new outbreaks reported recently in Thailand,
were a reemergence of the virus in previously hit areas, he said.

However, the situation in Indonesia is much more serious than in other
countries because of "the magnitude of the outbreak and the magnitude of
the problem. It is very clear that the Indonesian authorities are
stretched to the limit," he said.

Indonesia has been criticized for waiting months before it acknowledged the
existence of bird flu there and for being slow to order a culling program.

The official death toll of chickens in Indonesia is estimated at 6.2
million, and the number of chickens culled estimated at 2.5 million.
However, the FAO estimates that a total of 15 million chickens have died or
been culled.

The FAO statement said the movement of livestock and livestock products
from affected areas to clear zones is a cause for serious concern in Indonesia.

Due to inadequate resources, the government is not able to effectively
quarantine affected areas, and many farms are not able to apply basic
bio-security measures, the statement said, quoting Joseph Domenech, chief
of the FAO's Animal Health Service.

Separately, the FAO said Monday that Japan has pledged USD 1.6 million to
help Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, and Viet Nam in their fights against bird
flu. The FAO will use the money to provide technical expertise, basic
emergency equipment and materials for investigations, culling operations,
and cleaning and disinfection of infected premises.

[2] South Korea, H5N1

South Korea Confirms New Case of Bird Flu
-----------------------------------------
South Korea confirmed Monday its first case of bird flu for more than a
month, dashing hopes it had seen the last of an epidemic that has ravaged
poultry and killed 24 people across Asia.

The outbreak, discovered at the weekend at a chicken farm in Kyonggi
province, was the first new case since 5 Feb 2004, and 16 000 poultry at
the affected farm were destroyed on Sunday, the agriculture ministry said.

Agriculture Minister Huh Sang-man visited the area on Monday and urged
thorough disinfection measures to contain the outbreak, the ministry said
in a statement.

"One farm located in the city of Yangju has tested positive for highly
pathogenic avian influenza," it said. Yangju is about 25 miles north of the
capital, Seoul.

It said that a combined 400 000 chickens and ducks within a 3-km (1.9-mile)
radius of the affected farm would be destroyed and poultry farms within a
radius of 30 km (19 miles) to 40 km (25 miles) would be checked twice a day
by telephone for new outbreaks.

Before the latest discovery, South Korea had destroyed nearly 5 million
poultry and confirmed outbreaks at 19 farms across the country since early
December 2003.

Certain strains of bird flu can be fatal to humans, although South Korea
has had no human deaths. The strain of bird flu in the country was
different from the type that killed people in Viet Nam and Thailand, South
Korea said during February 2004, citing tests by a U.S. disease control agency.

The ministry said that more than 2000 chickens that had been shipped from
the affected farm to a slaughterhouse south of Seoul would be destroyed.

The virulent H5N1 avian flu virus had also been found in a magpie captured
and tested in the southern city of Yangsan, where an outbreak was reported
in January 2004. But it was not expected to pose a significant threat, as
the incubation period was short in magpies, the ministry added.

"We tested 99 magpies and one crow in Yangsan after the disease
confirmation on 11 Jan 2004, and one magpie was confirmed to have the
disease Saturday," its statement said.

South Korea's poultry consumption has been hit badly by bird flu so far in
2004, and exports of chickens and chicken meat to Japan, Hong Kong, and
China were halted. Local feed production for poultry in January also
dropped 11.5 percent from a year earlier to 288 407 tonnes, industry data
showed.

Government officials and civic groups led a series of campaigns aimed at
convincing people poultry was safe to eat.

The campaigns, as well as tighter supplies after a mass slaughter of
poultry and import bans, helped prices of local chicken meat recover to
1563 won (USD 1.35) per kg after tumbling by 40 percent to 611 won after
the initial outbreak, a ministry official said.

South Korea also halted imports of poultry from 12 countries, including
Taiwan, Japan, Viet Nam, Thailand, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Pakistan,
China, Canada, Hong Kong, and the United States because of bird flu outbreaks.

FAO demands poultry tests
-------------------------
Asian countries that declare victory over avian influenza should base such
statements on in-depth investigations, FAO and the World Organisation for
Animal Health (OIE) urged in a joint statement today. There have been fears
that Viet Nam is planning to begin poultry restocking before adequate
checks have been carried out.

"Collaboration between countries and the international community is
essential to ensure that the avian influenza virus really is under control
and that effective preventive and control measures have been put in place
in each affected country and its neighbours," said the UN's Food and
Agriculture Organisation FAO and OIE. Both organisations said that they
were prepared to provide international experts to assess the
epidemiological situation.

It is now more than 3 months since the outbreak of avian influenza in
several Asian countries, which resulted in 23 human deaths in Thailand and
Vietnam. At least 100 million birds have died or have been culled to
control the disease.

"The crisis is still not over," FAO and OIE warned. "In countries such as
Indonesia, Laos, Cambodia, and Thailand, further outbreaks could still
flare up. The virus could spread again within and between countries. As
long as the H5N1 virus is not fully under control, the potential threat to
human health remains."

The statement follows concern that Viet Nam is seeking to import between
500 000 to 600 000 tonnes of corn for feed. According to the Vietnamese
ministry of trade, there is a possibility that import tariffs on corn
purchase may be waived, opening the door to grain exporters from Australia,
Europe, and the US.

The move is supported by the Vietnam Husbandry Feed Association, which
represents 138 feed processors in the country. It has warned of a possible
rise in feed prices of up to 1.5 percent, with processors looking to offset
losses caused by bird flu.

Vietnam, where an estimated 38 million poultry died, is expected to declare
the virus eradicated later this month [March 2004].

Thailand, whose poultry export business annually tops USD 1 billion, has
been forced to cull over 25 million chickens. Like Viet Nam, the country is
obviously desperate to restore its poultry industry. But not everyone is
confident that Thai assurances that the country remains free from the virus
can be trusted -- the government denied the existence of the virus for weeks.

Events in Asia are causing concern in Europe, where consumers have been
jittery since the issue of bird flu began to dominate the news agenda a few
months ago. Aside from the health aspect, poultry producers in the EU are
concerned quick restocking could further undermine public confidence in
poultry products.

EU officials have been keen to reiterate that a Europe-wide 6-month ban on
the import of all southeast Asian poultry is currently in place, and that
the ban will remain in force until categorical proof that the disease has
been eradicated.

"In the battle against the disease, there are definitely some improvements.
But we fear that the virus may continue to circulate in the environment
even without an outbreak or any clinical signs in animals," said Joseph
Domenech, chief of the animal health service. "Appropriate precautionary
measures have to be put in place to be absolutely sure that infected zones
are free from infection and will remain free," he added.
