Increasing numbers of U.S. troops get Cutaneous Leishmaniasis
-----------------------------------------------
Staff Sgt. Eric DiVona didn't notice the small bumps on his face and left
earlobe until he returned from serving for 9 months in Iraq. "Nothing
much," he thought, "probably just a spider bite." But soon those bumps
erupted into open sores, one growing to the size of a half-dollar. The left
side of his face puffed up, a swelling that wouldn't go away. And he
noticed that he was not the only one in his unit with such symptoms. "A lot
of people started coming down with sores," he said, sitting at Walter Reed
Army Medical Center with an IV taped to his right arm. "It was like, 'You
ain't cool unless you got it.'"
What DiVona thought was a spider bite was actually caused by a tiny sand
fly with a fierce parasite stewing in its gut, an organism that causes
stubborn and ugly sores that linger for months. Scientists and doctors
refer to the disease caused by the parasite as cutaneous leishmaniasis. But
soldiers serving in sand-fly-rich Iraq call it, with little affection, the
"Baghdad boil." The sores are not painful or contagious, but, left
untreated, can last up to 18 months leaving permanent, burn-like scars.
Since the flies bite exposed skin, many soldiers have sores on their necks,
faces and arms.
Doctors at Walter Reed have seen 653 cases of leishmaniasis, and the
hospital's infectious disease wards, until recently, overflowed with
soldiers undergoing a 20-day treatment regimen. "We see a few cases every
year, but not the numbers we saw come out of Iraq," said Col. Dallas Hack,
chief of preventive medicine at Walter Reed.
The military has made a big effort to treat the disease, even pulling
soldiers with confirmed leishmaniasis out of the field and flying them back
to Washington for medical care. But Walter Reed doctors say it was almost
inevitable that they would see a high number of cases in 2004.
Leishmaniasis occurs in hot and tropical countries where sand flies dwell,
Hack said. Still, only about 20 soldiers got leishmaniasis during the first
Gulf War, and a handful more contracted it in Afghanistan. This time,
though, American forces arrived in Iraq during the peak season for sand
flies and were in the field much longer. Many slept outside at night,
exposing themselves at the sand fly's favorite feeding time.
Iraqis have done little to control the problem, such as using insecticide
to kill off the flies, Hack said. Local residents have come to accept the
disease, he said, exposing young children to sand flies in hopes of
building immunity.
Doctors have told soldiers in Iraq what to look for and have implored them
to wear bug spray. Medical teams with front-line combat troops have tested
sand flies for the parasite. But with enemy bullets flying, the 1st concern
of most soldiers is not slathering on bug spray every morning. "You didn't
think about leishmaniasis too much," said Maj. Eric Moore, who contracted
the parasite on the Iran-Iraq border with the 4th Infantry Division. The
lesions eventually go away on their own and do not affect a soldier's
ability to serve. Even so, the military thought it was important that
soldiers with bad cases be flown out of Iraq for treatment so they wouldn't
be disfigured.
In Moore's unit of about 750 men, more than 200 came down with
leishmaniasis during a 10-month tour that ended in Mar 2004. He was
relatively lucky. He has only one quarter-sized sore on his left arm.
Others had lesions all over their bodies, he said. Moore isn't too worried
about scarring. He predicts it will delight his children, especially his
3-year-old, who has a fascination with Band-Aids. "They will probably think
it's cool," he said, while getting his daily dose of a drug called
Pentostam. "They'll probably say, 'Daddy has an ouchie.'" "For most
soldiers, it isn't a war-stopper," said Lt. Col. Glenn Wortmann, an
infectious disease physician at Walter Reed. "But most patients want
treatment so the thing will go away."
Walter Reed is one of only 2 hospitals where patients are sent, because the
treatment can only be done in a clinical trial setting. With domestic cases
a rarity, Pentostam is not licensed in the United States. However, the
Army is developing a treatment that can be used in the field. Many soldiers
didn't realize they had the boils until weeks after exposure. DiVona
remembers being bitten constantly by flies, but he and other members of his
unit didn't see any sores until after they got home to Fort Campbell,
Kentucky in Nov 2004.

[ProMED has covered the risk of cutaneous leishmaniasis in U.S. troops
stationed in Iraq extensively. Though the incidence of 200 cases out of 750
men in a single unit seems extremely high, it is not impossible with
soldiers staying outside in a highly endemic area at the height of the
transmission season. So far, there have been two cases of visceral
leishmaniasis reported. - Mod.EP]
