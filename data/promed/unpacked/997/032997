Dengue fever sweeping through Southeast Asia is threatening Hong Kong as
more cases are being imported, a medical expert warns. The mosquito-borne
disease has killed nearly 500 people in Indonesia this year and has left
tens of thousands seriously ill. It has also claimed lives in Thailand,
Vietnam, Malaysia and Singapore.
Up to the end of March, Hong Kong had four recorded cases - one from
Thailand, one from Vietnam and two from Indonesia. The number is already
nearly half last year's total of 10 cases and the concern is that as the
disease peaks during Southeast Asia's forthcoming rainy season, more people
will bring the virus to Hong Kong, says Dr Lo Wing-lok, infectious disease
expert for the Hong Kong Medical Association...
Four cases in three months is already "quite high", he said. "But it's not
entirely unexpected because there are so many cases in neighbouring regions."
... There have been no recorded local cases, although dengue fever only became
a notifiable disease in Hong Kong in 1994 when there were three cases. In
1995 there were six cases.
A Department of Health spokesman said a campaign against mosquito breeding
had been launched. Sponsored by the two municipal councils, the aim is to
remove stagnant water to eliminate the mosquitoes' favoured breeding
grounds.

or tree-hole breeders - Mod.JW]
Although dengue fever is predominantly spread by the striped _Aedes aegypti_
mosquito -- which is not found in Hong Kong -- it can also be transmitted by
another breed, _Aedes albopictus_, which is found in [Hong Kong].
