Saudi Arabia: A Fatal Case of Al Khurma Virus Infection
-------------------------------------------------------
A 46-year-old female patient presented to our hospital with fever, 5
days after attacks of vomiting. One day before admission she became
confused. She was admitted to the intensive care unit. Upon
admission, clinical laboratory investigation showed leucopenia 1.6,
thrombocytopenia 62, impaired renal function with elevated creatinine
10.6 mg/dl. Liver enzyme AST was elevated at 135 U/L. The patient was
given intensive treatment and support, despite which she developed
progressive hypotension, bleeding, and cardiac arrest. Since the
above clinical laboratory results are common findings in many viral
hemorrhagic fevers in our region; e.g. Rift valley fever (RVF),
Alkhurma fever, and dengue fever, this was the provisional diagnosis.
Blood samples were collected for viral diagnosis, including RT-PCR,
virus isolation, and IgM ELISAs. A dengue virus RT-PCR was negative,
whereas the RVF virus RT-PCR was initially positive. The diagnosis
was [provisionally] considered to be RVF virus infection [pending the
results of virus culture].
Virus isolation gave a growth pattern which is not [characteristic of
RVF virus]. Testing the sample for Alkhurma virus by RT-PCR was
positive, and a repeat RVF virus RT-PCR gave a negative result
[suggesting contamination was responsible for the initial positive
reaction]. The growth pattern and the RT-PCR indicated that the
infectious agent is Alkhurma virus.
Alkhurma virus cases are usually detected around the time of the Hajj
(when pilgrims visit the holy city of Mecca) because there is
increased animal movement and slaughtering . From our experience, the
virus is very stable. We were able to isolate the virus from serum
samples kept in the lab in [in an ordinary domestic refrigerator] for
about one year. This means that infected sheep meat kept in a
domestic freezer could still transmit the virus to housewives
preparing the meat if their hands had cuts and abrasions.
This is the first isolation of Alkhurma virus we have obtained in the
past 2 years. We [intend to carry out comparative nucleotide sequence
analysis to determine the genetic relationship] of this isolate to
the previous isolate (1176).

[Tick-borne flaviviruses responsible for hemorrhagic fever in humans
have been isolated in Siberia (Omsk hemorrhagic fever virus), India
(Kyasanur Forest disease virus, KFDV), and in Saudi Arabia (Alkhurma
virus, ALKV). ALKV has been genetically determined to belong to the
tick-borne group of flaviviruses. A demonstrated genetic relationship
with Kyasanur Forest disease virus (KFDV) from India suggests these 2
viruses share a common ancestry. ALKV human infection is presumed to
be caused by contact with infected sheep or ticks feeding on
virus-infected sheep.
The complete coding sequence of the genome of Alkhurma virus was
determined by Charrel et al. (Complete Coding Sequence of the
Alkhurma Virus, a Tick-Borne Flavivirus Causing Severe Hemorrhagic
Fever in Humans in Saudi Arabia. Biochemical and Biophysical Research
Communications, 2001, 287: 455-461) and phylogenetic analysis of the
tick-borne encephalitis virus complex established that ALKV and KFDV
constitute 2 genetic subtypes of the same virus species (i.e. the
species _Kyasanur Forest disease virus_) according to the 7th Report
of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses.
Note: Professor Zaki used the form Al Khurma virus in his letter. I
have converted this to the alternate spelling (Alkhurma virus) for
consistency in archiving. - Mod.CP]
