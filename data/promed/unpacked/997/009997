More cases of eastern equine encephalitis have been reported in horses
in Michigan. The Michigan Department of Agriculture tells the
Kalamazoo Gazette that through Thursday [30 Sep 2010], there have been
130 cases this year [2010]. Officials have called this year's outbreak
the worst in 30 years.

The disease is rare but can be deadly among humans, and officials want
people to take steps to prevent its spread. In August 2010, Michigan
health officials reported that lab tests confirmed that 3 people
contracted the disease.

Health officials say people should take steps to avoid being bitten by
mosquitoes and horses should be vaccinated.
