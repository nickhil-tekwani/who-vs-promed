An outbreak of rabies has claimed the lives of 10 persons in Delta State.
The total number of hospitalized patients is uncertain. The spokesperson
for the state agricultural ministry said that more than 1,500 does of rabies
vaccine have been distributed in affected areas. Delta State is home to one
of Nigeria's 4 petroleum refineries and to a major Shell Oil operations center.

[The only animal mentioned in this report was a dog that bit a veterinarian.
At times, Nigeria has carried out effective rabies vaccination programs in
stray dogs, thereby greatly reducing the threat of human rabies. It is
unfortunate to see this present occurrence. We would be interested in more
details. - Mods.PC/DP
