A Benton County resident was bitten by a bat that tested positive for rabies, health officials from the State of Oregon and the Benton County Health Department confirmed [Wed 5 Jul 2017].

On [Mon 3 Jul 2017], Benton County Environmental Health learned a resident was bitten by a bat on [Sun 2 Jul 2017].

According to Benton County, the resident noticed the bat behaving unusually on the front port of his or her residence before the person was bitten.

Oregon state Veterinary Diagnostic laboratory in Corvallis said the bat tested positive for rabies. This is the 1st bat that's tested positive for rabies in Benton County in 2017.

"Bats are the primary reservoir of rabies in Oregon," said Robert Baker of Benton County Environmental Health.

The person with the bite is being treated for the rabies exposure.

Baker said if a bat bites someone, that person should attempted to safely capture the bat without destroying its head. That way officials can test the bat for rabies.

Genetic evidence suggests that rabies is an old disease for bats in the New World. Bats from most of the bat species in North America, when sampled in sufficient numbers, have been found to be infected with rabies virus. Rabies viruses recovered from bats were shown to be distinct from rabies viruses recovered from terrestrial mammals, suggesting that these viruses evolved within their bat hosts. Bat rabies viruses of bats are genetically diverse, exhibiting mutations characteristic to each host bat species. It should be taken into account, however, that bat rabies can be transmitted to humans and their domestic animals, since infections are almost always fatal, unless treated prophylactically. - Mod.PMB
