A retrospective study conducted by the Council of Agriculture (COA) shows that rabies virus has been present in Taiwan for at least 3 years, as 5 of the 13 Formosan ferret-badger samples preserved since July 2010 have recently been tested and found to be positive for rabies [virus], the Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) said yesterday [6 Sep 2013].

A total of 17 ferret-badgers preserved by the council's Endemic Species Research Institute had been sent for testing, 4 of which lacked enough brain tissue to be tested. However, 5 of the remaining 13 samples were tested using [a] fluorescent antibody test and a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction [assay] for a retrospective [analysis] and were found to contain rabies antibodies and nucleic acids, the agency said. The center said that of the 13 samples, the oldest dated back to 17 Jul 2010 and was collected in Nantou County's Guosing Township. These results have indirectly confirmed that this strain of rabies is not new to Taiwan, the center stated, adding that it will report its latest findings to the World Organisation for Animal Health [OIE].

Four of the 5 positive samples were from Nantou County, and one was from Chiayi County, which are among the 9 rabies-affected regions where rabies-infected ferret-badgers have been found earlier this year [2013], Director of the council's Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine Chang Su-san said. "The preserved samples collected from other counties such as Taoyuan County have tested negative for rabies. These results match our expectations," Chang added.

Although the latest tests found that rabies has been in the country for at least 3 years, the surveillance of the disease in other animals such as dogs, cats, and bats in the past 3 years has not detected cross-species transmission of the virus, the center said.

As of 3 Sep [2013], a total of 490 wild carnivores had been tested for the disease, according to the command center. Of the 112 confirmed rabies infections, only one was an infected Asian house shrew, while all of the rest have been ferret badgers.

[As of 5 Sep 2013, the total number of confirmed rabies virus infections of wild Taiwanese ferret-badgers was 112 animals since the disease was 1st detected in mid-July 2013, after an apparent absence of 52 years. This new analysis of 13 archived specimens of ferret badgers has found 4 rabies-virus-positive specimens which date back to 2010. Therefore, rabies virus was present in the island of Taiwan at least as far back as 2010 and very likely much further back. Although rabies virus infection of domesticated animals has not been detected for at least 52 years, it cannot now be concluded that rabies was ever eradicated from the island, although it is still a possibility that the virus was reintroduced into wild animals more recently. The shy and retiring habit of ferret-badgers and their lack of contact with both wild and domesticated animals and humans may have allowed rabies virus infection to have persisted in Taiwan for a long period.
