"[...Nevertheless, cats that explore rodent burrows, or kill and eat
flea-infested rodents, could serve as temporary hosts for these
ectoparasites and bring them into human habitations, etc., where they could
jump off and bite people - Mod CHC]"
Judging from what Dr. Eidson has said, cats aren't very suitable hosts for
rodent fleas (they apparently don't spend much time on them). The
possibility would seem to be rather remote that they would wait on a cat's
body for it to come home, then to jump on an equally unsuitable host
(human) to finally transmit the plaque. It is probably possible, but
evidentially not the center of attention for a control program.

[Had I known anyone would read my comments, I would have said, "fed on
people", not "bite people". Nonetheless -- various workers have recovered
rodent fleas from pets. There has been a cat-associated human plague case
in northwestern New Mexico, where fleas were noted on the cat. Cat fleas
(_Ctenocephalides felis_) are not present in this part of the U.S. (too
dry) and the fleas almost undoubtedly were associated with the prairie
dog/rock squirrel die-off that was going on in the same area. Rodent fleas
might not stay on pets for long periods of time but the fact that
investigators have found them on these animals suggests that some rodent
fleas stay on long enough to be carried into homes. While treating cats or
dogs with flea powders that are insecticidal or repellent might not
completely solve the problem, it is a relatively easy operation to perform
and could result in some reduction of risks (of course, it would be best if
people confined their animals but they rarely do so). The entire
prevention/control package would include community education, dusting
rodent burrows, heightened surveillance, implementation of rodent
sanitation measures, etc., as well as asking people to confine their
animals and to treat them for fleas. Treating pets is just a minor part of
the public health response and scarcely constitutes the "center of
attention" of a control/prevention program. Let's cut this string. - Mod
