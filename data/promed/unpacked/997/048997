Neospora not just abortion disease
---------------------------------
Neospora outbreaks in Texas have cost the cow-calf business $25 million (US).
Linked to cattle abortions, researchers have found neospora also causes
production losses in surviving calves, said Texas A & M University
veterinarian Kerry Barling.
"It is a sizable loss to the Texas cattle population," he told an animal
committee examining emerging diseases at the National Cattlemen's Beef
Association.
Bob Bohlender, chair of the cattle health committee, said there was a 13
percent infection rate among 1000 steers arriving for a performance
study. "It is much more than an abortion disease."
Calves testing positive for neospora gain weight slower than healthy
animals, so producers earn $17.71 less on each one. The disease's effects
have been monitored for 3 years.
There is no registered vaccine.
It is thought Texas herds were infected by gray foxes or coyotes carrying
the disease by leaving infected droppings or saliva in feeding or
watering areas. They may also leave deposits in calving areas where they
come to eat placentas left on the ground. Domestic dogs also carry and
spread the virus. Blood appears to be another cause.
"There was an association between the dam's serological status and calf's
serological status," Barling said.
There are several management strategies to keep an area free of
infection. Besides cleaning up afterbirths and guarding feed supplies
from wildlife, producers can prevent neospora infection by better
management of round bale feeders.
Most people leave them in the same place all winter. Feed is spilled,
cattle eat and trample it, and pathogens move in for more animals to
contract.
Intervet Inc. has produced a vaccine for dairy cows to reduce abortion.
It was licensed by the United States Department of Agriculture 22 Dec 2000,
said company representative Les Choromanski.
More research is expected for beef cattle vaccines in the next year.
Neospora was first recognized as a major cause of abortion in California
dairy cattle in 1991. Dogs were identified as positive hosts in 1998.
