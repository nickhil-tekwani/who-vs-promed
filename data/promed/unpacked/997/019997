Around 500 backyard birds have died in Jhyalbas and Deurali VDCs of
Nawalparasi district in the past few weeks.

Following the outbreak, a team of veterinarians led by the senior
officer at the Animal Health Directorate (AHD), Dr Narayan Prasad
Ghimire, was sent to the VDCs for a stamping out operation following
verbal orders from Dr Ram Krishna Khatiwada, the programme director,
AHD, yesterday [12 Mar 2010].

The team comprised Dr Dayaram Chapagain of the Department of
Livestock Service (DLS), Chitwan, Dr Laxman Bahadur Dhakal, Chief of
DLS Nawalparasi, Dr Damodar Neupane and a technician from the
National Avian Laboratory, Chitwan.

However, the team had to return from the VDCs without any job done as
they failed to receive a written order from the Department of
Livestock Services (DLS) to carry out the same. Dr Khatiwada said
that the report of the sample was not ready. "It might come by Sunday
[14 Mar 2010] evening," he said.

When asked about the team sent to the site, he said that was for the
diagnosis and to make preparation for culling if the result was found
to be positive. "We need to prepare for several things including
financial matters before culling the birds in order to maintain
international norms," he said.

One of the team members said the condition in those areas was
"horrible," as more birds are being infected and dying fast.

Sources said the birds of a local resident of Jhyalbas had tested
positive for H5N1 virus in the central veterinary laboratory,
Tripureswor.

As per the Bird Flu Control Order-2064 BS, the government needs to
declare a "Crisis Zone" after a sample tests positive for H5N1 avian
virus either in the Central Veterinary Laboratory, Tripureswor or in
any of the World Organisation for Animal Health reference
laboratories. Nepal used to send the samples to the reference
laboratory in Waybridge, London, for confirmation.

The government had earlier failed to declare the outbreaks in
Budhabare-Jhapa, Chainpur-8 in Chitwan, Buddhanagar in Rupandehi and
Fultekra in Nepalgunj on time.

It may be noted that the authorities had revealed the outbreak only
after The Himalayan Times reported that the government had been
keeping the public in the dark.

The Nepal Veterinary Association (NVA), Chitwan chapter, has
condemned such acts of the government and the DLS.

[On 5 Feb 2010, Nepal notified the OIE about outbreaks in Pokhara
sub-metropolitan city ward No. 7, Gharipatan, Kaski, Gandaki; see,
with map, at
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=8929>.
Reportedly, 153 cases of HPAI H5N1 were recorded within a population
of 11 281 birds, namely "backyard ducks and chickens and a few
commercial farms," of which 11 128 were, reportedly, destroyed.

An official update will help in preventing rumors like the ones
included in the above newswire. - Mod.AS]
