Properly boiled meat a way to avert anthrax say experts
-------------------------------------------------------
Properly cooking meat in 120 degree Celsius [248 DEG F] temperature
is an easy way to avert anthrax, said the experts in the capital
yesterday at a seminar.

They also said the spore (germ) of anthrax cannot sustain in 120
degree Celsius. But we are use to cooking meat in a pot at 100 degree
Celsius [212 DEG F] temperature which cannot ensure whether the
anthrax spore is destroyed, they added in a seminar titled 'Anthrax:
Public Health Issues' which was held at the Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib
Medical University (BSMMU).

Sources said as people are affected with the disease for the 2nd
time, it created panic among them and consumption of red meat has
reduced in last few weeks.

Meanwhile, 10 fresh anthrax cases in humans were suspected in Pabna
yesterday [22 Sep 2010] taking the number of the infected to 599 in
the country since 18 Aug 2010. In addition, 4 cases were confirmed in
Santhia and 4 in Faridpur upazila, according to the Institute of
Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR).

But the government has taken various steps to control anthrax
including vaccinating the cattle in affected areas, treating the
patients, and screening the cattle coming from India through the 22
points of the country, said State Minister for Health Mozibur Rahman
Fakir in the seminar. He also said that before the Eid-ul-Azha,
public health experts would screen the cattle and certificates would
be given. The livestock, health and LGRD ministry are working
together in this regard and a National Steering Committee is already formed.

The experts in the seminar said the incidence of anthrax is showing a
downtrend and it is likely to ease within a short time. They also
suggested blanket vaccination of the cattle, use of antibiotics to
treat the cattle, burying the sick dead animals after being wrapped
in polythene and increasing community awareness to tackle anthrax.

Dr Salahuddin Khan of ICDDR,B, Prof M A Jalil Chowdhury of BSMMU, Dr
Benazir Ahmed, principal scientific officer of IEDCR, presented
papers in the seminar while Vice Chancellor of BSMMU Prof Pran Gopal
Datta, former vice chancellor Prof Nazrul Islam were also present.

Anthrax control not possible before Eid-ul-Azha
-----------------------------------------------
A massive vaccination programme to contain anthrax will not be
possible before Eid-ul-Azha, livestock minister Abdul Latif Biswas
has said [That is 16/19 Nov 2010 - Mod.MHJ]. "It will take much time
and so the government will 1st run its vaccination programme at 18
sub-districts (upazila) under 8 districts, affected with anthrax," he
told reporters after an inter-ministerial meeting over the issue on
Tuesday at the Secretariat. It will take up to 15 days, he added.

Animal resources and livestock secretary Sharful Alam and livestock
department director general Ashraf Ali were present, among others.

The government on Tuesday [21 Sep 2010] formed a 25-strong national
steering committee, led by Latif, and a 5-member technical committee,
led by the joint secretary of livestock ministry, to conduct anthrax
control activities. In addition, 4 other committees were formed at
district- and Upazila-levels; 10-member steering committees led by
the divisional commissioners; a 14-member committee, led by deputy
commissioners at each district; an 11-member committee, led by the
Upazila Nirbahee Officer (UNO); and 7-member committee, led by the UP
chairman at each sub-district.

The local MPs will carry out their duty as chief advisors of the
sub-district-level committees and the Upazila chairmen as advisors of
those committees.

Cattle will be vaccinated across 18 sub-districts. From now on,
livestock department, health department, local government department
and local public representatives and relevant officials will work
towards implementing the activities, he said.

From now on, veterinary surgeons will be appointed at the check
posts of 10 corridors on the border area. The cattle crossing the
border into the country will also have medical tests, he said. The
monitoring over cattle in markers and cattle meat will be intensified.

Steps will also be taken on stopping sales of anthrax-affected
cattle. He reassured that people could thus safely eat beef.

There are 2.5 million vaccines in 18 sub-districts of 8 districts,
affected with anthrax. So far 1.9 million vaccines have been sent for
cattle and the rest will be swiftly sent, he said. The vaccination
programme is temporary. The government will take steps in preventing
anthrax and so (we) have to wait until the technical committee's
suggestions and plans are received. The government will begin its
short, medium and long term activities after receiving the
suggestions and plans, he said.

A top ministry official preferring not to be named said there will
need one year to complete the vaccination programme across the
country with present manpower and infrastructure facilities and so
the government will decide over the issues upon the technical
committee's suggestions, he said.

Anthrax scare threatens exports in Bangladesh
---------------------------------------------
The government fearing the panic taking deep roots in the economy has
formed a national committee for control of anthrax infection before
the Eid-ul-Azha, the Moslem festival of sacrifice of cattle in November [2010].

The manufacturers of finished leather and leather goods, who make
nearly half a billion dollars in export earnings, are equally
nervous. Last year [2009] the export earnings from exports of
finished leather amounted to USD 226 million and exports of leather
shoes and leather goods earned more than USD 200 million.

Usually beef and mutton is in high demand during Muslim festival
Eid-ul Azha. Nearly 40 percent of the annual supply of rawhides is
procured during the festival, said Mohammed Aftab, president of the
Bangladesh Hides and Skin Merchants Association.
