ND imposes more tests for Minnesota livestock producers
-------------------------------------------------------
North Dakota will impose stricter testing requirements on Minnesota
producers who want to bring livestock into the state.

The North Dakota Board of Animal Health today [22 Feb 2008] ordered
the new rules to kick in immediately in response to an outbreak of
bovine tuberculosis [TB] across the border in Roseau County and a
corner of Beltrami County in northwestern Minnesota. "We're not
surprised," said Deb Dahlke, executive director of the Minnesota
State Cattlemen's Association, "We have been advising our members of
this scenario that this could very well happen." Dahlke said
Minnesota producers are being told to get whole-herd disease testing
completed before hauling livestock across state lines.

The North Dakota order, signed today [22 Feb 2008] by Nathan Boehm,
president of animal health board, pertains to all cattle, bison,
goats, farmed elk, and llamas coming into the state from Minnesota.

[The key to this evolving situation is that since October 2007, 4
beef cattle herds in the northwest Minnesota have tested positive for
the highly contagious respiratory disease. All were found within a TB
management zone set up by the state in southern Roseau and
northwestern Beltrami Counties. The heart of the zone is about 90
miles (145 km) northeast of Grand Forks. Minnesota had been bovine TB
free for about 30 years, until July 2005, when a beef cattle herd
near Salol, MN, in Roseau County tested positive for the disease.
Since then 10 others in roughly the same area have tested positive.
North Dakota has been rid of the disease since the early 1980s,
according to Wade Moser, executive vice president of the state
Stockmen's Association. For the full script go the Herald website listed above.

It all started with a herd being found infected in midsummer, 2005,
in Roseau County on the US-Canadian border. Active investigation was
initiated which has been tenacious. Prior to that it had not been
seen in the state since 1971. - Mod.MHJ
