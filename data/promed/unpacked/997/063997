Eighteen elementary school students became ill Wednesday [20 Feb 2013], and 16 of them were taken to the hospital, after apparently ingesting nicotine lozenges used to help smokers quit.

Five ambulances were sent to Wendell E Green Elementary School, at 1150 W 96th St., around 10:10 a.m., to respond to reports of sick children. According to the Fire Department, 18 children, ages 9 and 10, ingested "Niquitin Minis," which are over-the-counter lozenges used to treat nicotine withdrawal symptoms in smokers who are trying to quit.

The students got the lozenges from another student, and took them thinking they were mints, according to Chicago Public Schools spokeswoman Marielle Sainvilus.

Sixteen children were taken to local hospitals in good condition. 2 children refused transportation to a hospital after receiving treatment at the scene.

"This is a form of stop-smoking medication that contains nicotine, so when these young kids got a hold of it, they started to vomit and become sick," said Chicago Fire Department Spokesman Larry Langford. Langford said the children had badly upset stomachs but didn't appear to be in serious medical condition The sick students' parents were notified of the incident, and letters were being sent to other parents about it. Nurses and social workers were also sent to the school to provide support.

["Niquitin Minis" are lozenges designed to dissolve in the mouth and reduce the craving for nicotine. They come in plain or original, mint, and cherry flavor and are available in 2 different strengths containing either 1.5 or 4 mg of nicotine. The lozenges release their nicotine 3 times faster than nicotine gum and are designed to be dissolved in approximately 10 minutes with a recommended 8-10 a day and never more than 15 in a day. These are mini lozenges and should never be chewed or swallowed.

They are widely available in the UK, and on Amazon.com (see picture at http://www.niquitin.co.uk/Global/GB/en/images/header/header-minis.jpg

It is possible these mini mints were the mint flavor as nicotine can have a bitter taste. Acute intoxication with ingested nicotine in people may present with clinical signs of abdominal cramps, vomiting, weakness, confusions, convulsions, and breathing that may be rapid, or completely stop. Headaches, high blood pressure, and a rapid heartbeat may also be part of the clinical picture.

The clinical signs mentioned in the article are consistent with nicotine intoxication.

Treatment at a hospital would include symptomatic care, gastric lavage, and activated charcoal. Mild cases may be self limiting, as with the children that declined treatment.
