A horse in Clay County has tested positive for rabies, according to
health officials. Owners of the horse and their family are undergoing
rabies vaccination as a precaution.

This is the 2nd case of rabies in Clay County this year [2009]. The
1st was a skunk that tested positive for the virus in March. Since 1
Jan 2009, 38 positive cases of animal rabies have been reported in
Kansas. The rabid animals testing positive so far include 30 skunks, 3
dogs, 2 cows, one bobcat, one fox, and one raccoon.


The risk for human exposure is real, but preventable. Animal
rabies is common in Kansas and skunks are the animals most likely to
have the disease. However, skunks can pass the virus to other
animals. Prevention of human rabies depends on maintaining an
adequate buffer zone of vaccinated domestic animals, eliminating
human exposures to stray and wild animals, and providing exposed
persons with prompt post-exposure rabies treatment. The last human
case of rabies in Kansas was reported in 1968.

The Clay County Health Department has reminded people who own pets
and livestock to make sure their animals receive rabies vaccination
from their veterinarian. A vaccine is available for dogs, cats,
ferrets, horses, cattle, and sheep. All mammals are susceptible to
the virus and it is usually transmitted from the bite of an infected
animal.

"I recommend every dog, cat, and horse owner to contact their
veterinarian about rabies vaccination," according to Dana Rickley,
Clay County Health Administrator. "Sometimes we forget that a rabies
vaccination is not a once in a lifetime event for our animals, they
need periodic boosters to stay safe from the virus."

Clay County Health Department and local veterinarians offer these
tips to prevent rabies:
- Have your veterinarian vaccinate all dogs, cats, ferrets, horses,
and valuable breeding stock (cattle and sheep) against rabies.
- If bitten by an animal, seek medical attention and report the bite
to your local public health department or animal control department
immediately.
- If your animal is bitten, contact your veterinarian for advice.
- Do not handle, or feed wild animals. Never adopt wild animals or
bring them into your home.
- Do not try to nurse sick animals to health. Call animal control or
an animal rescue agency for assistance.
- Teach children never to handle unfamiliar animals, wild or
domestic, even if they appear friendly.

For more information about rabies, contact your veterinarian or the
Clay County Health Department at 785-632-3193.
