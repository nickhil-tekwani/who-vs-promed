The presence of the bluetongue virus [BTV] of serotype 3 (BTV-3) in Sardinia was confirmed by the national reference center of Teramo on samples of organs taken from a sheep. It was suggested that this BTV serotype presumably arrived from North Africa by BTV-3 infected vector arthropods (culicoides), as already happened in the past for other BTV serotypes. The vectors are assumed to have been transported by the wind to south western Sardinia. This hypothesis will be checked in the coming weeks by analysing meteorological and epidemiological data. To date, 7 BT outbreaks have been confirmed in Teulada, presumably all caused by BTV3, although at the moment only the 1st outbreak has been confirmed by laboratory. The clinical symptoms in these herds were typical of BT, involving a fairly limited number of animals, generally presenting non-severe symptoms, with only 4 dead sheep. Vaccination against BTV 1 and 4, was carried out on the affected sheep farms. The ruminant populations of Sardinia generally have a good immune coverage against these serotypes, following their circulation within many areas of Sardinia in the past few years, while vaccination campaigns funded by the region were implemented by the veterinary services.

"We are not dealing with a particularly serious disease-picture. It is true that at the moment no BTV3 vaccine is available," explains Alberto Laddomada, director general of the Animal Health Institute of Sardinia- "but experience shows that in any case, such vaccination, if implemented as an emergency measure during the last few months of 2018, would not lead to significant protection."

In relation to the vaccine, therefore, it is a matter of verifying whether it will be possible to obtain supplies for a campaign to be carried out in the course of 2019 [preceding the vector period]. In the meantime, all breeders must work to reduce the risk of BT in their herds by taking all the prevention and control of the vectors, measures that can protect farms from the introduction of the virus.

[The introduction of BTV-3 to Sardinia follows the identification of outbreaks in sheep, caused by this serotype, in Tunisia (late 2016) and Sicily (late 2017). It was shown that the virus spread from Tunisia north-eastward to Sicily by windborne infected culicoid vectors (20180123.5577601). It remains to be established how the same virus has been introduced to Sardinia; most probably from Tunisia northward, though also possibly by windborne culicoids from Sicily or by the (less likely) introduction of viremic infected animals from Sicily, becoming sources of further infection by the local Sardinian vector population (see map at https://goo.gl/maps/CmFdYsVf5Q12). The Sardinian dairy sheep breed is long known as being highly susceptible to BTV infection.

In September 2016, Israeli researchers published their discovery of a BTV strain in a tainted imported sheep pox vaccine (20160922.4508256). In 2017, Israel reported its 1st BTV-3 outbreak. It will be interesting to compare the genomes of the BTV virus strains discovered in the imported sheep-pox vaccine in Israel, the field strain BTV-3 in Israel, and the (remote from Israel) Tunisian, Sicilian, and Sardinian BTV-3 strains. - Mod.AS
