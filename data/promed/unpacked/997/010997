Brazil confirms FAM outbreaks expanding
-----------------------------------------------
The Brazilian government confirmed on Tue 3 Oct 2005 new outbreaks of
foot and mouth disease (FMD) in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul that
will demand the sacrifice of thousands of heads of cattle.
Since Brazil is the world's leading beef exporter, President Luiz
Inacio Lula da Silva, currently on a European visit, which included
Spain, Italy and Russia, is trying to convince his colleagues that
the situation is "under control."
The 1st outbreak was reported last 10 Oct 2005 in the Vezozzo farm in
the Mato Grosso do Sul county of Eldorado, where an initial 582
cattle were destroyed.
However, on Tuesday [18 Oct 2005], the Brazilian Ministry of
Agriculture had to admit that 3 new FMD outbreaks had been reported
in the area, one of them in a neighboring farm of Vezozzo and 2
others in the county of Japora, just 4 km from the Paraguayan border.
Matto Grosso do Sul has had no FMD reported cases since 1999.
Sanitary officials have already sacrificed 320 out of a total herd of
3548 in Jangada, the main farm FMD outbreak in Japora.
"We plan to work under a permanent state of emergency," said the
Agriculture Ministry's Food Safety Secretary, Gabriel Alves Maciel.
The new FMD cases constitute a major blow for Brazil, since 30
countries have banned beef imports, which could represent losses of
almost USD 1.5 billion, according to the Brazilian Agriculture and
Livestock Federation.
The Brazilian government is extending the quarantine area to include
other counties clustering the original Eldorado, where it all started.
Authorities are also investigating the source of the outbreak, with
prime suspects being livestock imports from neighboring Paraguay
without the necessary health controls, or simply smuggled in, a
breakdown in the vaccination system or the purchase of sick cattle
from a Landless Movement MST camp in the area.
Meanwhile, Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, currently
on a state visit to Moscow, is trying to convince Russia that the
disease is under control.

Country and date: Brazil, 20 Oct 2005
Type: Unofficial
ISSUE: Defiant ranchers in Japora said they would not let police
slaughter cattle exposed to FMD unless they were first compensated
for the animals killed.
SUMMARY: Farmers and ranchers demanded payment after learning that
some of the 1050 cattle on 2 small ranches were infected and would be
exterminated to keep the disease from spreading beyond the Midwestern
state of Mato Grosso do Sul. But owners want to avoid the wholesale
slaughter at the Jangada Ranch near Eldorado, a few miles
(kilometers) away, where policemen with handguns or rifles
slaughtered at least 300 cattle. Federal authorities already have
ordered the slaughter of more than 4500 head of cattle.
