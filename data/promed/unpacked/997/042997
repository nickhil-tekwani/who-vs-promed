Russia has recorded its 1st cases this year of the highly pathogenic H5N1
strain of bird flu in dead domestic birds, the country's animal and plant
health agency said on Monday [29 Jan 2007].
Rosselkhoznadzor [The Russian agriculture inspection agency. - Mod.AS] said
in a statement the virus was detected in dead birds found in 3 domestic
yards in the Krasnodar region of southern Russia.
"Yes, it's H5N1," a spokesman for the agency said, when asked to confirm
the strain of the virus.
Rosselkhoznadzor said measures were being taken to prevent the spread of
infection in the 3 settlements where cases were found -- Labinsk, Upornaya
and Borodinskaya.
The agency said tests had been carried out in regional laboratories and
further tests would now be conducted in Moscow.
Russia recorded more than 90 cases of bird flu last year. Most were in
southern regions, particularly the North Caucasus area that borders Georgia
and Azerbaijan. Several cases were also found in the Siberian regions of
Novosibirsk and Omsk.
The outbreak of H5N1 avian influenza began in Asia in 2003 and outbreaks
have been confirmed in about 50 countries and territories.
Bird flu has killed 164 people from a total 270 cases recorded in humans
since 2003, World Health Organisation data shows. At least 200 million
birds have been culled worldwide.
No human cases have ever been recorded in Russia. Five people have died
from 8 cases in neighbouring Azerbaijan.

[2] Hungary: 2nd outbreak in geese

The deadly H5N1 strain of bird flu infected fowl in Hungary, marking the
1st infection in Europe since the disease was last reported in August [2006].
Authorities found the H5N1 avian influenza strain in 2 separate flocks of
geese in Hungary, European Commission spokesman Philip Tod said, confirming
the findings of the eastern European country's veterinary agency. The EU
announced the 1st outbreak, involving about 3300 geese, on 24 Jan 2007.
The 2nd outbreak is about 8 km (5 miles) from the 1st and "this outbreak is
in a flock of 9384 geese," Tod told journalists in Brussels today. "As a
precaution, the flock and all animals within 1 km of the flock were culled."
Countries in Asia and Africa including Vietnam and Egypt reported fresh
outbreaks of H5N1 starting in November, after going months without finding
infections. The last reported infection in Europe was a wild bird found in
Germany in August, according to the Paris-based World Organization for
Animal Health [OIE].
The European Union is the world's biggest consumer of chicken meat after
the U.S. and China, at 7.4 million metric tons last year. The 27-nation
bloc is the world's 3rd-biggest poultry producer.
EU members have reported 178 outbreaks in domestic poultry since 2005,
according to the animal health agency. Romania has had the most poultry
outbreaks in the EU at 168. EU members Hungary, Denmark, France and Germany
also have reported infections in domestic birds. Greece and Italy are among
EU countries that have found the disease in wild birds.
Tod said the EU is "in a period of high risk," adding that the bloc's
members have been asked to be particularly vigilant for signs of bird flu.

[The reappearance of H5N1 in distant locations within the northern
hemisphere during December 2006, followed -- during Jan 2007 -- by the
first cases within Europe,namely Hungary and south Russia, might support
the suggested role of migratory birds in the dissemination of the virus.
Other factors which deserve consideration are the international trade,
official and unofficial, in poultry and in other birds, including wild
species; the use of deficient, non-certified vaccines has also been
suspected to be a factor contributing to the continuation of the H5N1
panzootic.
Comprehensive surveillance activities in wild birds are being undertaken by
EU member-states; their last update of 30 Nov 2006, is graphically
presented under the title "HPAI cases in wild birds in the MSs -- total 748
infected birds/Cases notified to ADNS (Animal Disease Notification System)
from 1 Feb to 30 Nov 2006", accessible at
<http://ec.europa.eu/food/animal/diseases/adns/adns_wildbirds.pdf>.
An update, with the results of current and February surveillance
activities, are anticipated with great interest. - Mod.AS]
