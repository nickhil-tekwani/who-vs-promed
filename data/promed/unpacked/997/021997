[This is indeed unfortunate news, as this is a serious zoonotic
pathogen for humans causing the multifarious symptoms of Undulant
Fever. People not only experience a chronic disease that is hard to
treat but also often develop clinical depression associated with the
infection. The disease in sheep and goats, while debatably less
severe, still causes reduced milk yield,
abortion and a severe orchitis in males. For a history of brucellosis
in Croatia see reference below. - Mod.PC]
