At least 5 people have died of scrub typhus, a disease caused by the
bite of an infected mite, in Meghalaya in the past 3 weeks, an
official said here [Shilong] Thursday [1 Dec 2011]. However, a
private-run hospital here put the toll at 12.

"Over 40 people were tested positive for the disease and admitted in
hospitals and 5 people died of it," Meghalaya Integrated Disease
Surveillance Project (IDSP) officer RR Lanong told IANS [Indo-Asian
News Service]. "We have verified and found out that 5 people died -- 4
in H Gordon Roberts Hospital and one in Nazareth Hospital," the
medical official said. Smit, Lad Mawreng, Tyrsad, Mawkyrwat,
Moodymmai, Sohkymphor, Sutnga, Mawlein, Umsning, and Ummat villages --
all in eastern Meghalaya -- were the most affected, the official
said.

Though treatment is available at health centres, due to ignorance, the
disease has turned fatal, Lanong said. To avoid this, the health
department has launched a vigorous campaign to create awareness among
the rural masses.

Medical superintendent of H Gordon Roberts Hospital, David Tariang,
said 12 people have died in his hospital alone due to scrub typhus and
25 are undergoing treatment. The symptoms of the disease include
fever, headache, muscle pain, cough, and gastroenteritis --
inflammation of the mucous membrane of the stomach and intestines.

WL, et al. Scrub typhus, Republic of Palau. Emerg Infect Dis. 2006; 12

"Scrub typhus is a zoonotic illness caused by _Orientia
tsutsugamushi_. The pathogen is transmitted through the bite of larval
mites (chiggers) of the _Trombiculidae_ family, which serve as both
the vector and the reservoir (1,2). Rodents of the family _Muridae_
(rats and mice) are common hosts for trombiculid mites and may support
_O. tsutsugamushi_. Geographically specific foci of scrub typhus are
thus determined by the distribution of vector mites and their rodent
hosts and by interactions of mites and rodents with humans (3). Scrub
typhus has been reported from many regions of Asia and the Pacific
islands, and known disease-endemic regions extend from Japan and
eastern Russia southward to Australia and westward to Pakistan and
Afghanistan (4,5).

"Scrub typhus is typically a nonspecific febrile illness; its severity
may be influenced by the strain of _O. tsutsugamushi_, a person's
immune status, and other factors. Diagnosis may be complicated in
areas where the disease has not been documented recently or in regions
lacking the capacity for laboratory confirmation. Illness develops
after an incubation period of 6 to 21 days and usually begins with an
eschar at the site of a chigger bite. Fever, headache,
[lymphadenopathy], and myalgias are common, and a maculopapular rash
may also be present. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or lower respiratory
symptoms can also occur. Manifestations such as pneumonitis,
meningoencephalitis, jaundice, renal failure, and myocarditis can
develop during the prolonged clinical course of untreated illness (6).
Establishing the diagnosis and initiating prompt antimicrobial drug
therapy are important, because death rates for untreated scrub typhus
patients are 1-30 per cent (5). Scrub typhus is effectively treated
with doxycycline, and treatment should begin immediately upon
suspicion of illness without awaiting laboratory confirmation."

Rodents may serve as reservoirs, although transovarial transmission in
mites is the dominant mechanism for maintenance of _O. tsutsugamushi_
(http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol9no12/03-0212.htm). Humans become
infected when they accidentally encroach in an area where the
chigger-rodent cycle is occurring, most often areas of low-lying scrub
brush or transitional vegetation.

Patients with severe scrub typhus can develop multiorgan failure and
disseminated intravascular coagulopathy with hemorrhage.
