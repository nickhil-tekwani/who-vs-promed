[1] Jordan (Jordan valley), turkeys: H5N1

Jordan became the latest country in the Middle East to confirm cases of the
deadly H5N1 strain of bird flu on Friday but said no humans had been
infected and the outbreak was under control.
Jordanian Health Minister Said Darwazeh said at least 3 dead turkeys at a
domestic farm in Ajloun had tested positive for the disease but none of the
humans tested in the area were infected.
20 people were given the antiviral drug Tamiflu and the area has been
cordoned off to prevent the disease from spreading further, he told a news
conference in Amman.
"The disease in its current form is more of an economic disease that
affects poultry. It has had a very limited effect on human health," he said.
The virus had already been detected in some of Jordan's neighbors and other
countries in the region. Iraq, Turkey and Egypt have reported human cases
and infected poultry was found in southern Israel and spread to the densely
populated Gaza Strip this week.
Darwazeh said Jordan had been on high alert since bird flu was detected in
Israel and that its own outbreak was isolated.
The H5N1 bird flu virus reached Jordan after rippling out from Asia to the
Middle East, Europe and Africa. It can infect people who come into close
contact with infected poultry.
The virus has killed 104 people since 2003, according to World Health
Organisation (WHO) figures updated on Friday.
Experts fear the virus will mutate into a form that passes easily from
person to person, sparking a pandemic in which millions could die and which
could cripple the world economy.
Darwazeh told Reuters that Jordan had notified the WHO of the cases and
would ask it for technical assistance if there was a serious outbreak. "So
far I think the situation is under control," he said.
Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni's office said U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan had agreed to bolster U.N. aid teams to combat the virus's
spread in affected Palestinian areas after a plea for assistance.
Israel Radio reported Israel and Jordan were coordinating efforts to combat
the spread of the virus.
An outbreak of H5N1 in Israel prompted authorities to cull 1.2 million
birds at 13 farms. Israel Radio quoted agriculture ministry officials as
saying they had not detected any new cases of the virus in the country.
Jordan began culling birds within a 6-km (4-mile) radius of the outbreak on
Friday. Birds further away will be vaccinated.

[2] Jordan (Jordan valley), turkeys: H5N1

Jordan has reported its first cases of bird flu after a few turkeys died on
a poultry farm, but it says the deadly disease has not spread to any farm
workers who came into contact with the birds.
Jordan's Health Ministry announced the cases on Friday [24 Mar 2006],
saying tests have confirmed that the strain is H5N1. The farm is north of
the capital Amman [see commentary below].
Officials have ordered people in the Jordan Valley to eat poultry from
their farms within a week or risk of having their birds culled. Officials
have also increased monitoring of birds on poultry farms in the valley.
Jordan had already imposed a ban on imports of poultry products and pet
birds before the discovery this week.
The Middle Eastern country has reportedly imported 60 000 doses of Tamiflu,
the frontline drug used to treat humans who develop bird flu, and it has
set aside significant funds to handle a possible outbreak. It has said it
would use the money to vaccinate poultry and to compensate farmers for the
loss of their flocks.

[Ajloun (map at <http://www.visitjordan.com/flash/map/map.asp>) is situated
about 15 km east of the Jordan river which separates the Kingdom of Jordan
from Israel and about 30 km northeast of Beqaot, Israel, where earlier this
week an H5N1 outbreak was diagnosed in a turkey farm. Beqaot is located
about 10 km west of the Jordan river. Contrary to the earlier outbreaks in
southwestern Israel and in the Gaza strip, where the virus is suspected to
have been spread by humans, mechanical means, or contaminated subjects and
materials, the 2 outbreaks on both sides of the Jordan river might be
attributed to migratory birds, since the Jordan valley is a major flyway.
However, these assumptions remain, for now, speculative. - Mod.AS]

[3] Palestinian Authority (Gaza strip), poultry: H5N1

Palestinian officials confirmed an outbreak of the deadly H5N1 strain of
bird flu at a 2nd farm in the Gaza Strip on Friday [24 Mar 2006], and
Israel's foreign minister appealed to UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan for
international assistance to the Palestinians to contain the disease.
In all, bird flu has been detected at 2 farms in the Gaza Strip, one near
Gaza City and one near the southern town of Rafah on the border with Egypt,
said Deputy Agriculture Minister Azzam Tubaili.
Gaza chicken farmers planned a protest later Friday, after government
officials told them they would not be compensated for culled birds. The 2
affected farms have a total of 80 000 chickens.
"They (the farmers) are preventing the culling because they want
compensation before they let us do this," Tubaili said. "This is causing
confusion. Any second of delay will really make a difference."

[The Gaza strip, bordering Egypt (11 km border) and Israel (51 km border),
stretches across an area of about 40 by 9 km, namely 360 sq km -- slightly
more than twice the size of Washington, DC. See map at
<http://www.infoplease.com/images/mgaza.gif>. With a population of about
1.4 million, it is one of the most densely populated territories in the world.
From a public health point of view, eradicating H5N1 there is clearly a
high priority. Adequate, prompt payment of compensations is a prerequisite
to obtain the cooperation of the animal owners in the culling activities
and secure early notifications of future outbreaks. In addition, determined
and properly equipped veterinary services are needed to achieve efficient
eradication. - Mod.AS]

[4] H5N1 and Endangered species

The deadly bird flu virus may pose a fresh threat to endangered mammal
species including big cats such as tigers and leopards, the United Nations
Environment Programme (UNEP) said on Wednesday [22 Mar 2006].
UNEP said it was especially concerned about countries like Vietnam, which
is home to both a rich variety of wild species and a large poultry industry
that has been hit by avian flu outbreaks.
"A far wider range of species, including rare and endangered ones, may be
affected by highly virulent avian flu than has previously been supposed,"
UNEP said in a statement.
It said experts at the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) conference
in Brazil said "there is growing evidence that the H5N1 virus can infect
and harm big cats like leopards and tigers, small cats such as civets and
other mammals like martens, weasels, badgers and otters."
Since late 2003, the H5N1 strain of avian flu has killed more than 100
people and in recent weeks has spread with alarming speed into Africa,
Europe and Asia. It has killed or led to the culling of some 200 million
birds globally.
It also has been detected in a marten, a weasel-like mammal, in Germany,
and there have been reported infections in cats in Germany and a dog in
Azerbaijan [see commentary].
In December 2003, 2 tigers and 2 leopards fed on fresh chicken carcasses
died unexpectedly at a zoo in Thailand. Subsequent investigation identified
H5N1 in tissue samples.
UNEP said avian flu could also pose an indirect threat to rare animals if
concerns about chicken meat or poultry culls forced poor people in rural
areas to turn to wildlife for their protein.
"Culling of poultry, especially in developing countries where chicken is a
key source of protein, may lead to local people turning to 'bushmeat' as an
alternative," it said. "This may put new and unacceptable pressure on a
wide range of wild living creatures from wild pigs up to endangered species
like chimpanzees, gorillas and other great apes."
But UNEP said drastic measures, such as culling wild birds or draining
wetlands, had to be avoided.
UNEP said wild bird species that appeared at special risk from the virus
include members of the crow and vulture families.
Bird flu could have devastating consequences on island habitats, which tend
to be especially fragile because of their limited size and separation from
other ecosystems. Their isolation also means they often harbor species
found nowhere else, making them "biologically valuable."
UNEP said some islands, from Hawaii and the Galapagos across to the
Seychelles and Mauritius group, may need to consider bans on imports of
poultry and wild birds in order to safeguard their special biodiversity.
Some critics say bird flu may well be a product of a shrinking gene pool in
domestic livestock caused by modern farming methods.
"... reduced genetic diversity in domestic animals like poultry in favor of
a 'monoculture' in the last 50 years has resulted in a reduction of
resistance to many diseases," Ahmed Djoghlaf, executive secretary of the
CBD, was quoted as saying.

[The inclusion of the dog case, recently reported in Azarbaijan, in the
above list of susceptible mammals, is a reminder that this case has not
(yet) been confirmed by a laboratory. Referring to a stray dog found dead
on 9 Mar 2006 in the Azerbaijani capital Baku, the "state commission tasked
with fighting the spread of bird flu" was quoted as stating that "after
analysis type A bird flu was discovered. The medical investigation is
continuing" (see 20060316.0818).
So far, no further details -- including any notification to the OIE -- are
available. Further data, confirming the suspicion or otherwise, will help.
