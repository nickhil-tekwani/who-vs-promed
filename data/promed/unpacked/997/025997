Cambodian disease linked to virus
---------------------------------
Cambodian health officials and the World Health Organization say most of the children who died from a mystery disease in Cambodia had contracted the EV-7 [human enterovirus 71] infection -- a virus linked to hand, foot and mouth disease [HFMD]. The children were below 3 years of age and were mainly from the southern and central parts of the country. 56 have died since April 2012.

Dr Nimal Asgari, a WHO spokesman in Phnom Penh, said a significant number of the samples tested by the Institut Pasteur identified the virus as EV-71. However, it is still not known if all the children had the virus because not all children were able to provide samples.

Children's deaths in Cambodia linked to enterovirus
---------------------------------------------------
The Institut Pasteur in Cambodia has discovered Enterovirus Type 71 in about two-thirds of patients it tested after a mystery disease killed more than 60 children in the country, said the head of the institute's virology unit.

Enterovirus Type 71 is a "perfect explanation" for the deaths, Philippe Buchy said by telephone today. "We can now focus on how to contain it," he said.

[It remains to be determined whether other viruses or infectious agents are implicated in this outbreak of fatal disease in Cambodia. Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) is generally a mild disease usually caused by an enterovirus such as human coxsackievirus A, human coxsackievirus B, or human enterovirus 71. Infection by human enterovirus 71 may have more serious outcomes, but otherwise HFMD is a mild illness. HFMD gets its name from the non-itchy rash that develops on the palms of your hands and soles of feet. It can also cause ulcers in the mouth although many individuals have no symptoms.

Human enterovirus 71 has emerged as an important cause of viral encephalitis in South East Asia over past 15 years. A pattern of increased epidemic activity and endemic circulation of HEV71 has been observed since 1997 and is associated with the regular emergence of new genetic lineages. Although the reason for this increase in HEV71 circulation remains unknown, evidence is accumulating that recombination events may drive the evolution of new genetic lineages. [see: McMinn PC. Curr Opin Virol. 2012 Apr;2(2):199-205].

Although poliomyelitis has been mostly eradicated worldwide, large outbreaks of the related human enterovirus 71 have been seen in Asia-Pacific countries in the past 10 years. This virus mostly affects children, manifesting as hand, foot, and mouth disease, aseptic meningitis, poliomyelitis-like acute flaccid paralysis, brainstem encephalitis, and other severe systemic disorders, including especially pulmonary oedema and cardiorespiratory collapse. Clinical predictors of severe disease include high temperature and lethargy, and lumbar puncture might reveal pleocytosis. Many diagnostic tests are available, but PCR of throat swabs and vesicle fluid, if available, is among the most efficient. Features of inflammation, particularly in the anterior horns of the spinal cord, the dorsal pons, and the medulla can be clearly seen on MRI. No established antiviral treatment is available. Intravenous immunoglobulin seems to be beneficial in severe disease, perhaps through non-specific anti-inflammatory mechanisms, but has not been tested in any formal trials. Milrinone might be helpful in patients with cardiac dysfunction. [See: Ooi MH, Wong SC, Lewthwaite P, Cardosa MJ, Solomon T. Lancet Neurol. 2010 Nov; 9(11):1097-1105].
