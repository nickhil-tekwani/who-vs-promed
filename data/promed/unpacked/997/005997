Mass domestic fowl deaths have been reported in 2 villages in the
Rostov region in southern Russia, a local official said Friday [21 Oct 2005].
In all, 270 waterfowl have died in a suspected outbreak of the fowl
cholera, the official said, adding that test samples had been sent to
regional veterinary lab for thorough analysis.
"We are trying to identify and slaughter the birds affected by the
disease," the official said.
A European Union committee recommended Thu [20 Oct 2005] that the
European Commission ban live fowl imports from Russia, with the
exception of certain regions. The ban and the fowl cholera incidents
come on the heels of a mass outbreak in Siberia of bird flu, also
confirmed Wednesday to be responsible for poultry deaths in the Tula
region near Moscow.

Domestic birds that have suddenly sickened and died in 2 villages in
southern Russia this week have succumbed to avian cholera, not bird
flu, the Emergency Situations Ministry and National Epidemiological
Service said Friday [21 Oct 2005]. Sergei Petrov, a duty officer at
the ministry's southern regional branch in Rostov-on-Don, said that
preliminary tests on samples from the villages of Kolundayevsky and
Shabliyevka indicated pasteurellosis, or avian cholera, a bacterial
infection. An outbreak can kill thousands of birds.
Some 500 chickens, geese and turkeys died in Kolundayevsky, and more
than 200 ducks and geese died in Shabliyevka, in the Rostov region
about 1000 kilometers (600 miles) south of Moscow, he said.
Liver samples from the dead birds have been sent to a laboratory for
more analysis, he said.

[Fowl cholera is a contagious bacterial disease of worldwide
distribution caused by _Pasteurella multocida_. The disease affects
many types of domesticated and wild birds. It is not a zoonotic
disease. Fowl cholera may be acute with sudden or rapid death or may
be chronic. Losses usually occur in birds over 16 weeks of
age. Sulpha drugs and antibiotics will reduce the mortality rate in
an acute outbreak. Vaccination may be effective; however, since there
are various serovars of _P. multocida_, the vaccine used should
include those serovars prevalent in the affected country/region. It
is also possible to apply an autogenous vaccine, i.e. one made from
an isolate obtained from a specific outbreak on a farm.
Since avian influenza and Newcastle disease might be manifested by
similar symptoms, the clinical, epidemiological, and patho-anatomical
findings must be backed by laboratory investigation. Expedient
dispatch of suspected material, properly sampled and transported, to
the laboratory is of utmost importance. Such handling of the
above-described outbreak should have ruled out the said 2 viral
diseases. - Mod.AS]
