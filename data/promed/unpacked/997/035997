An Indonesian boy died from bird flu in the capital on Saturday [13 Oct
2007], bringing the country's death toll from the virus to 88, the Health
Ministry said.

The 12 year old junior high school student from Tangerang, on Jakarta's
south western outskirts, died after being treated for 5 days at
Persahabatan Hospital -- a designed bird-flu hospital in Jakarta -- said
Daswir Nurdin of the ministry's bird flu center. "He was reported to have
had contact with dead chickens close to his school," Nurdin said, adding
that the boy 1st developed breathing problems and a fever on 30 Sep 2007
and initially visited a local clinic. The boy was brought to Persahabatan
on Tuesday [9 Oct 2007], Nurdin said. "His death raised Indonesia's death
toll of bird flu to 88 deaths out of 109 cases, he said.

Indonesia has been hardest hit by the virus since it began ravaging poultry
stocks across Asia in 2003. Its human death toll now accounts for almost
half of the recorded 200 fatalities worldwide [actually 88 of 202 worldwide
(43.6 percent) as of 14 Oct 2007 - Mod.CP], according to the World Health
Organization.
