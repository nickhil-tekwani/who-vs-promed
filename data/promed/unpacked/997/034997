As the demand to get racing back in action increases, David Sykes, director of equine health and welfare at the British Horseracing Authority (BHA), was able to issue more good news.

"At 9:00 a.m. Sunday [10 Feb 2019], I can say we haven't had any other positive tests except for those in the Don McCain stable; all tests have returned negative, up until when I was last in contact with the laboratory at 9:30 p.m.," he told Racing TV's Luck On Sunday programme.

"I can tell you that in the last 3 days, the Animal Health Trust has done as many flu swabs as they would [normally] do in a year. They are working until 9:00 p.m. at night and working through Saturday and Sunday [9-10 Feb 2019]. They've done a great job. I would say we are looking at around 1500 [unconfirmed] samples that have been carried out, and all are negative so far."

While no more horses have tested positive, including those at the yard of Rebecca Menzies, who reported "suspicious" cases on Friday [8 Feb 2019], Sykes was unable to issue an update on when racing may resume.

"We're still in lockdown until we can gather some more information. While it's nice to have around 1500 samples that are negative, it would be nice to have more of them so we get a better idea of what is out there in the general population," he said. "If we can demonstrate that those stables that ran at Ayr, Ludlow, or Wolverhampton are negative, we can gather up quite a bit of information and then make a decision on Sunday or Monday [10 Feb or 11 Feb 2019] about continuing racing."

In some quarters the BHA has been accused of an overreaction, but Sykes is adamant they took the only course of action available to them.

"In any infectious disease process, the hardest decision is the very 1st one. You can't go back if you make a mistake," he said. "If we'd said it was fine and had runners go to 15 other meetings, that would have been very hard to control."

"It looks like this virus we've got, clade 1, is virulent; it's nasty. Cases were reported in Belgium and France last year [2018] in non-thoroughbreds.

"They were initially in non-vaccinated horses, but suddenly we are seeing it in vaccinated horses, which tells us it is able to overcome the immunity of the vaccine."

One of Donald McCain's horses, Raise A Spark, ran at Ayr on Wednesday [6 Feb 2019] and subsequently tested positive for the virus, and the results of the rest of the Ayr runners could have a big bearing on when racing returns.

"We may not have the results of the Ayr runners yet. If they are negative, we can be much more positive that it is contained to the one yard," said Sykes. "It's not my decision to make [when racing resumes]; it's one for the veterinary committee, so it wouldn't be right for me to say."

"If everything came back negative today, we'd be looking to move forward and start racing, but we need to be confident we don't undo all the good work by saying, 'let's go racing' if we're not fully confident we've got everything covered.

"There could be a stage where we resume racing, but some stables could still be in lockdown; that will be a decision for the veterinary committee. That may be painful for some, but it could be a decision that is right for the industry.

"My job is to do what we think is best for the industry."

The strain of equine flu that has halted UK horse racing is the same one that shut down racing in Australia for 3 months in 2007, affecting more than 10 000 horses. It is a strain endemic to North and South America known as Florida clade 1, Sky sources have established.

The British Horseracing Authority's (BHA) chief regulatory officer, Brant Dunshea, told Sky News: "We have seen in non-thoroughbred horses that have presented with the illness prior to this event that it has involved that particular strain. We are working at the moment with the Animal Health Trust to confirm that."

The BHA said it was "planning for a variety of scenarios under which racing may recommence," adding that it was "planning as normal for the Cheltenham Festival." It is meeting on Monday [11 Feb 2019] to discuss the "programme of upcoming race meetings."

Discussing the outbreak in Australia, Sky News correspondent Enda Brady said horses there were "not vaccinated at the time, and the virus was completely alien to that continent."

He added that vaccinated thoroughbreds in Britain have a "measure of protection" against [the virus].

A strain known as clade 2 is endemic to Europe, the BHA said.

Mr Dunshea, who was working in Australia at the time, said racing was stopped for a week in Melbourne and for "much longer" in other parts of the country.

Meetings at Huntingdon, Doncaster, Ffos Las, and Chelmsford have been axed. Racing will not resume until at least Wednesday [13 Feb 2019].

Since a number of UK horses tested positive for equine flu earlier this week [week of Mon 4 Feb 2019], 2100 have now been swabbed nationwide. More than 700 of those swabs have been tested and reported on.

Races were initially called off on Thursday [7 Feb 2019] after 3 horses from Donald McCain's yard in Cheshire were found to be unwell.

Mr Dunshea said that managing the desire of the public to go racing, and the welfare of the horses, was a "challenge" and a "fine balance."

"Of course, we all want to get back to racing as quickly as we can, and we will do that," Dunshea said. "But we will do that in a safe, measured, responsible way as soon as is possible."

Mr Dunshea said it was the right decision to close racing down, adding that the BHA was gathering as much information as it could to understand the scale of the problem and would "make decisions based on the science and expert advice."

Equine flu is a highly contagious viral pathogen that causes respiratory disease. Outbreaks of the condition often occur when susceptible horses are congregated and housed in close contact with each other. Symptoms include fever, loss of appetite, lethargy, a runny nose, swollen neck glands, and a cough.

The British Equestrian Federation says experts remain of the view that it is not necessary to cancel equine events under its jurisdiction as a racing shutdown across the country continues.

Racing across Britain has been cancelled until at least the middle of next week [week of Mon 11 Feb 2019] following an outbreak of equine flu affecting horses at a yard in Suffolk. Horses from the yard had travelled to 3 race meetings within a window, which could potentially see a spread of the virus.

The British Horseracing Authority (BHA) decided to shut down racing for several days until monitoring and testing could provide a more accurate picture on whether the virus had spread. In total, 6 horses have been confirmed as infected at the Suffolk yard. The BHA says analytical work is continuing, which involves testing of horses from the yards of several trainers across the country.

Of the 4 horses from the Suffolk yard who competed at fixtures this week [week of Mon 4 Feb 2019], one has returned a positive sample so far: Raise A Spark, who competed at Ayr on [Wed 6 Feb 2019].

The test relates to a sample taken the following day [Thu 7 Feb 2019], and the horse showed no clinical symptoms on race-day.

The BHA is restricting the movement of horses on a precautionary basis at the yards of 120 trainers who competed at the 3 meetings attended by horses from the Suffolk yard.

The British Equestrian Federation said its events were continuing at this stage: "The advice from our veterinary experts remains that it is not necessary to cancel other equine events, as there is as yet no evidence of widespread infection. However, we will continue to monitor this situation closely and will issue further updates as more information becomes available."

"We continue to urge all horse owners to be vigilant and follow the recommended guidelines on how to detect and prevent the spread of this infectious disease.

"We also urge any owners with suspected cases to take immediate veterinary advice, and if equine flu is confirmed by laboratory testing, they should contact their relevant member body."

Signs of equine flu include a fever, cough, snotty nose, enlarged glands under the lower jaw, swollen or sore eyes, depression, loss of appetite, and swelling in the lower legs.

The airborne virus can spread up to 2 km [1.2 mi], depending on the environmental conditions, and can be easily transmitted between horses who are in close contact, such as attending events, group training, and hunting, or between vaccinated and unvaccinated horses in the home yard.

It is essential that any horses showing signs of possible equine flu, or horses that might have been in contact with possibly infected horses, do not travel to competitions or other events where there will be groups of horses.

"If your horse has been in contact with an infected horse, we suggest that you should take immediate veterinary advice," the federation said.

"If your horse is currently vaccinated, but it has been longer than 6 months since the last vaccination, we recommend that you discuss a booster with your veterinary surgeon."

So far, all of the viruses that have been isolated in Britain from cases have been identified as belonging to the Florida clade 1 [FC1].

There have been multiple outbreaks of equine influenza in Britain and Europe in recent weeks. Cases were reported in Northern France at the end of December [2018], whilst positive diagnoses have been made in the 1st few weeks of 2019 in France, Belgium, Germany, Ireland, and the Netherlands.

Cases among vaccinated horses have been confirmed in Ireland, France [see commentary], and Belgium. There are links between recent Irish outbreaks and mainland Europe.

France has confirmed an epidemiological link with Belgium in 6 of the outbreaks, either via horse movement for trade or competitions. The influenza research group in Europe confirms that the virus strain circulating in France belongs to Florida clade 1. This is the 1st identification of FC1 viruses in France since 2009.

The virus circulating in Ireland has also been typed by the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) Reference Laboratory at the Irish Equine Centre as FC1. This is the 1st identification of an FC1 virus in Ireland since early 2010.

There have been at least 20 confirmed cases in the Netherlands since mid-December [2018].

Meanwhile, the world governing body for horse sport, the FEI [International Federation for Equestrian Sports], has issued flu guidelines to the equestrian community following the European outbreak, as well as cases in the USA.

"Vaccinating horses against equine influenza is key to combating the spread of equine influenza," FEI veterinary director Goran Akerstrom says. "It is important that all horses are vaccinated, regardless of whether or not they compete or come into contact with other horses, but there are also biosecurity measures that should be put in place, including best hygiene practices."

All FEI horses must have an up-to-date vaccination history in their passports, and checks are carried out on entry to all FEI events.

FEI veterinary adviser Caterina Termine said: "This year [2019] we are seeing a return of the clade 1 virus in infected horses. Vaccinated horses have suffered only mild clinical signs of the disease and recovered quickly, but unvaccinated horses have been much more severely affected."

"The key message is, get your horse vaccinated, monitor horse health extremely closely, and call your veterinarian if you have any concerns."

[A letter published in the Veterinary Record of 19 Jan 2019 (Ref. 1), presents observations made in France during very recent outbreaks of equine influenza caused by the Florida clade 1 [FC1] virus; special attention is paid to vaccination. The full text (references omitted) follows:

"Preliminary results from a large-scale seroepidemiological study we conducted in 2018, involving 3000 French horses, reveals that equine influenza vaccination is well established, with 90% of the studied population possessing antibody titres above the protection threshold against clinical signs of disease and 60% virus shedding.

"The predominant use in France of the recombinant canarypox virus equine influenza vaccine ProteqFlu-Te (Boehringer Ingelheim/Merial), the only fully updated equine influenza vaccine licensed in the EU with DIVA (differentiating infected from vaccinated animal) capability, allowed us to confirm that the measured equine influenza immunological status was mostly attributed to equine influenza vaccination, with little immunological evidence of equine influenza virus (EIV) circulation, a fact strongly supported by the Network for Epidemio-Surveillance of Equine Diseases in France (RESPE), a group of more than 780 veterinary practitioners from all over the country. Probably due to such high vaccine coverage, the last French equine influenza outbreaks identified by the RESPE date from 2015 and were induced by Florida clade 2 (FC2) EIV strains (e.g., A/eq/Saone-et-Loire/1/2015), a sublineage commonly isolated in Europe.

"However, since early December 2018, France has experienced several equine influenza outbreaks. Outbreaks have also been reported in Belgium, the UK, and Germany in January [2019] [according to FEI, also Ireland and Netherlands. - Mod.AS]. While epidemiological investigations are still ongoing, it appears that some of the French outbreaks seem to be associated with the introduction of unvaccinated EIV-infected horses in large premises, with a number of vaccinated horses subsequently developing short-lasting disease.

"Serological analyses indicate that antibody levels induced by vaccination and assumed to induce protection may have been overcome in some cases. To our knowledge, 2 equine influenza vaccines are concerned: the ProteqFlu that contains 2 recombinant canarypox viruses expressing the haemagglutinin (HA) from the H3N8 EIV strains A/eq/Ohio/03 (Florida clade 1 [FC1]) and A/eq/Richmond/1/07(FC2), and Equip F (Zoetis), an immunestimulating complex-based vaccine containing the outdated EIV strains A/eq/Newmarket/77 (H7N7), A/eq/Borlange/91 (H3N8), and A/eq/Kentucky/94 (H3N8). Genetic analysis revealed that EIV strains at the origin of these recent outbreaks (i.e., A/eq/Paris/2018 and A/eq/Pas-de-Calais/2018) belong to the FC1 sublineage, which usually circulates in the Americas but has not been isolated in France since 2009. HA gene sequencing revealed 2 amino acid substitutions when compared with FC1 EIV strains isolated in South America in 2018, but more than 10 amino acid substitutions with the closest equine influenza vaccine strain A/eq/Ohio/03, with several of them located in antigenic sites. Such divergence may explain the few cases observed in vaccinated horses since December [2018], but further antigenic analysis will be necessary for the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) expert surveillance panel for equine influenza vaccine strain composition to evaluate its importance. The current situation is worrying but being closely monitored. However, it is important to note that most of the outbreaks that occurred in large premises with up-to-date vaccination seem to have been rapidly contained, which highlights the benefit of equine influenza vaccination to reduce the severity of the disease and its transmission, alongside strict biosecurity measures and surveillance." - Mod.AS
