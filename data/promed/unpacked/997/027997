Neno outbreak affects 133
-----------------
The mysterious epidemic that has plagued Neno continues to cause
casualties. It has now infected 133 people and caused 17 deaths.

A press statement from the United States Government says the disease,
which broke out in May this year [2009], has infected 95 people in
Neno and 38 in neighbouring Tsangano district in Mozambique.

"Affected persons display unusual symptoms with neurological
complications. Patients admitted to the hospital have been treated
with antibiotics and given supportive care including rehydration,"
the statement states.

The development forced the Malawi government to seek help from the US
government which has sent 5 specialists to investigate the outbreak.

"The specialists have expertise in environmental health and
neurology. They arrived in the country on [20 Jul 2009], and are
working with the District Health Officer and his team to conduct a
full investigation on the outbreak," the statement says.

It states that the experts were conducting epidemiological
investigations, diagnosis and laboratory support, treatment and
containment of the outbreak.

"Previous attempts to demystify the disease have proved futile
because the blood samples collected by the ministry for testing in
Malawi, Zimbabwe and South Africa all yielded negative," says part of
the statement.

According to the statement, new samples have been taken and are being
shipped to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in
the USA for further analysis.

Secretary for Health Chris Kang'ombe confirmed in an interview
yesterday that the specialists have already started their work.

Kang'ombe said the specialists would be in the country for 2 to 3 weeks.

"The results will be available immediately they finish their mission
in the country," the PS said.

The Government of Malawi formally requested Epidemiological Aid
assistance from United States Government on [15 Jul 2009].

[There are now 133 cases and 17 deaths (case fatality rate [CFR] 12.8
percent). In the 1st newswire covered in a prior ProMED-mail posting
on 11 Jul 2009 (see archive number 20090711.2489), there were
reports of 103 cases with 15 deaths (CFR 14.6 percent). The earlier
report mentioned a total population at risk of 1082, so the overall
attack rate has increased from 9.5 percent to 12.3 percent. The
earlier report mentioned a symptom complex of "stiff neck,
dehydration, fever, headache, joint pain, discomfort in abdomen and
loss of voice". The above newswire doesn't provide much more on the
clinical picture other than to mention neurologic complications. The
mention that environmental health specialists and neurologists are on
the investigating team from the CDC in the USA suggests that
environmental etiologies are suspected.

More information on this outbreak from knowledgeable sources would be
greatly appreciated.
