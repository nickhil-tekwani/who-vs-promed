It has been revealed that thousands of people in Sweden could have been
infected with hepatitis C after being given blood transfusions between 1965
and 1991, and the risk has been known for years. The National Board of
Health and Welfare thinks up to 23 000 people who might have the liver
disease should be traced.
In the past, it was thought that it might be unethical to contact patients
and tell them they were at risk, as there was not much that could be done
to help those who were infected. But the health board says now that there
are relatively effective treatments available [see comment below], patients
should be traced and informed.
The National Union of Hepatitis C patients welcomes the recommendation but
says that people should have been told before to reduce suffering and to
help stop the illness being passed on to others.

[This dilemma is not unique to Sweden and has had to be faced (or ignored)
by several countries with developed health care systems where blood
transfusion was used widely in general medicine before the presence of
cryptic bloodborne pathogens such as HIV and hepatitis C virus was discovered.
Those at risk of having contracted hepatitis C infection in the past or
currently include: injecting drug users, hemodialysis patients, recipients
of clotting factors prior to 1987, recipients of blood transfusion or organ
transplants before 1992, individuals having unprotected sex with infected
partners.
Currently, there is no licensed vaccine, but interferon and ribavirin are 2
drugs licensed for the treatment of persons with chronic hepatitis C.
Interferon can be taken alone or in combination with ribavirin. Combination
therapy, using pegylated interferon and ribavirin, is currently the
treatment of choice. Combination therapy can get rid of the infection in up
to 5 out of 10 persons for genotype 1 hepatitis C virus and in up to 8 out
of 10 persons for genotypes 2 or 3 hepatitis C virus. Further information
can be obtained from the appropriate CDC fact sheet at
