Abstract
--------
During 2013, cutaneous lesions developed in 2 men in the country of Georgia after they were exposed to ill cows. The men had never received vaccination against smallpox. Tests of lesion material with the use of a quantitative real-time polymerase-chain-reaction assay for non-variola virus orthopoxviruses were positive, and DNA sequence analysis implicated a novel orthopoxvirus species. During the ensuing epidemiologic investigation, no additional human cases were identified. However, serologic evidence of exposure to an orthopoxvirus was detected in cows in the patients' herd and in captured rodents and shrews. A 3rd case of human infection that occurred in 2010 was diagnosed retrospectively during testing of archived specimens that were originally submitted for tests to detect anthrax. Orthopoxvirus infection should be considered in persons in whom cutaneous lesions develop after contact with animals.

Discussion
----------
The 2 index patients described here became ill after occupational exposure to ill cows. Although cowpox was initially suspected, subsequent molecular analyses confirmed that the infection was caused by a novel orthopoxvirus species. This unique virus is the deepest branching lineage of all known Old World orthopoxviruses. Our findings raise important questions about the control of orthopoxviruses through public health efforts in the post-smallpox vaccination era, and they underscore the need to improve clinical awareness of poxviruses.

Although we found no evidence of human-to-human transmission of this virus, the index patients' history of exposure to ill cows and the serologic data from cows suggest that it is zoonotic. Cows are not routinely vaccinated against orthopoxviruses, and detection of anti-orthopoxvirus IgG in cows is therefore indicative of exposure to a naturally circulating orthopoxvirus. Unfortunately, our serologic assays do not distinguish among various species of orthopoxviruses, and the seropositive cows could have been exposed to an orthopoxvirus other than this novel virus.

Finally, our analysis suggests that this virus has remote common ancestry with variola, monkeypox, vaccinia, and cowpox viruses (all of which probably diverged from each other more recently). The unique phylogenetic position of this virus may provide insights about factors that determine the virulence of orthopoxviruses.

[Although cowpox virus is endemic in Europe in rodents and infects other mammals including cattle and humans, the genome of this new poxvirus is different from that of cowpox virus. ProMED-mail looks forward to follow up studies to further define the geographic range of the virus and prevalence of antibodies in humans and in domestic and wild animals. This report makes one wonder how many cases diagnosed clinically as cowpox are, in reality, caused by Akhmeta or another poxvirus.
