Nunavut's Department of Health is concerned that an outbreak of syphilis that began last year [2012] in the territory is still ongoing. Dr. Maureen Baikie, the Chief Medical Officer of Health for Nunavut, urges anyone who suspects they may have been infected with syphilis to visit their health care provider.

More than 30 cases have been diagnosed since the outbreak began last May [2012] in Iqaluit, and the sexually transmitted infection is spreading to other regions.

Syphilis is passed from person to person through direct contact with a syphilis sore. Symptoms can include a rash or a sore, but many people show no symptoms. Pregnant women can pass the infection to the fetus if they are not treated early.

The infection is easily cured with antibiotics, but if left untreated, it can cause severe damage to the heart, blood vessels and brain, and even death.

[The following has been largely extracted from moderator ML's comments in ProMED-mail post Syphilis - Canada (03): (NU) RFI 20120912.1291334:

Nunavut, the largest federal territory of Canada, is the size of Western Europe; it comprises a major portion of Northern Canada, and has an estimated population in 2010 of about 33 000, mostly Inuit (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nunavut). The territorial capital Iqaluit, which had a population in 2011 of 6699, is located on the south coast of Baffin Island (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iqaluit). Iqaluit was founded in 1942 as an American airbase to provide a stopover and refueling site to support the war effort in Europe (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iqaluit#History). Iqaluit is only accessible by aircraft and, subject to ice conditions, by boat.

As in the USA, the rates of infectious syphilis in Canada have been increasing since about 2000. In Canada, the male-to-female rate ratio increased from 1.5:1.0 in 1999 to 6.4:1.0 in 2008, reflecting that more males than females were reported with infectious syphilis, and this disparity increased over time (http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/std-mts/report/sti-its2008/05-eng.php). In 2008, men accounted for 86.1 percent of reported cases. Between 1999 and 2008, the rate in men increased from 0.7 to 7.3 per 100 000 and in women increased from 0.5 to 1.1 per 100 000. In men, the highest reported rate of infectious syphilis was shared between 25-29 year olds and 30-39 year olds (13.3 per 100 000) (http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/std-mts/report/sti-its2008/05-eng.php). Together, these age groups accounted for almost 40 percent of reported cases in men in 2008. In women, the highest reported rate was in 20-24 year olds (3.6 per 100 000). In males, the greatest increase in reported rates of infectious syphilis between 1999 and 2008 was in 25-29 year olds.

Nunavut did not officially become a territory until 1999; prior to 1999, data for Nunavut was combined with Northwest Territories. In 2008, no cases of infectious syphilis were reported in Nunavut (http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/std-mts/report/sti-its2008/05-eng.php); 13 cases of infectious syphilis, all of them in Iqaluit, were reported in a prior ProMED-mail post (Syphilis - Canada (03): (NU) RFI 20120912.1291334), where we were told the current outbreak mimics that which is occurring in the rest of Canada. Now we are told that there are more than 30 cases in Iqaluit, and the outbreak is spreading to other "regions," but details of the outbreak such as gender, ethnicity, use of illicit drugs, sexual behavior, or prostitution, are still not given in the news reports above.

Inuit comprise about 58 percent of Iqaluit's population (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iqaluit#Demographics), and they may constitute a large portion of the syphilis cases in Iqaluit, as in the Canadian province of Alberta, where infection rates of infectious syphilis are reported to be 18.6 times higher among young Aboriginal women and 2.8 times higher in Aboriginal men compared to their Caucasian counterparts (http://www.health.alberta.ca/documents/sti-syphilis-report-2010.pdf). These young Aboriginal women are reported to be largely linked to the "street based" sex trade, are often involved with problematic substance use, and are poor. (Aboriginal peoples in Canada comprise the First Nations, Inuit, and Metis; Metis are people with mixed First Nations and European ancestry).
