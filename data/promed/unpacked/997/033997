----------------------------------------------------------------------
On 8 Sep 2017, the United Kingdom reported (through the ECDC Early Warning and Response System) 3 cases of _Plasmodium vivax_ malaria in travellers returning from Esentepe [Agios Amvrosios, Kyrenia], the northern part of Cyprus.

Two of the cases were siblings aged 12 years who travelled independently from the 3rd case. The 3 cases stayed in the northern part of Cyprus for 2 to 3 weeks in August [2017] and developed symptoms on [29 Aug 2017]. They were laboratory confirmed upon returning to the UK.
