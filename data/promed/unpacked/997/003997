CHIKUNGUNYA (26): DONOR SCREENING, REQUEST FOR INFORMATION

With the increasing range of mosquito-borne diseases, as shown by
[ProMED-mail's recent post Chikungunya - France (03): (AM)
20100926.3495], at what point or threshold of 'native' cases should we
consider screening for these new, emerging pathogens in our blood and
organ donations?

The USA has already been through this experience with West Nile
[virus] (1) and in Singapore the risk from dengue is under continuous
review (2,3). Although we have the technology to screen for new
pathogens effectively now (4), it is difficult to say when such
technologies should be put in place -- delays can be costly to
governments as well as the patients (5).

It would be interesting to hear from the European perspective as
concerns about such vector borne threats seem to be increasing in that
region -- the _Aedes albopictus_ surveillance document at the end of
the link provided by the [moderator in ProMED-mail archive no.
20100926.3495]
(<http://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications/Publications/0905_TER_Development_of_Aedes_Albopictus_Risk_Maps.pdf>) is
impressive.

[Dr Tang raises an interesting and important question about policy and
practice for screening for pathogens that have a significant
probability of being present in blood, blood products, or tissues for
organ transplants. ProMED-mail would appreciate receiving information
from European health authorities concerning current policy and
practices, particularly in response to the recent appearance of
locally acquired chikungunya virus cases in southern France, the
chikungunya virus outbreak in Italy in 2007, and the steady arrival of
travelers from areas where outbreaks, or even sporadic transmission,
may be occurring.

An excellent assessment of _Ae. albopictus_-related disease risks,
including maps from the European Center for Disease Control, can be
accessed at the URL cited above by Dr Tang. - Mod.TY]
