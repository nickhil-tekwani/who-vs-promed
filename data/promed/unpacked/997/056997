K Maejima, et al. First report of _Plum pox virus_ infecting Japanese
apricot (_Prunus mume_ Sieb. et Zucc.) in Japan. J Gen Plant Pathol. 2010;
76, DOI: 10.1007/s10327-010-0233-6
---------------------------------------------
For the 1st time, _Plum pox virus_ (PPV) has been detected in commercial
Japanese apricot (_Prunus mume_) trees in Tokyo, Japan. These trees had
ringspot or mottle on leaves, color breaking of petals and, occasionally,
mild ringspots and malformation on fruits. The virus was identified based
on the morphology of virus particles, serology, and RT-PCR. The amplified
nucleotide fragment shared 100 per cent identity with a partial coat
protein gene of PPV-D isolates.

This is the 1st report of PPV in Japan. Notably, in Ome city, PPV was
detected from all symptomatic Japanese apricot trees examined, which
implies that PPV was the causal agent of the disease. A graft transmission
test is now underway to confirm the pathogenicity of PPV toward Japanese
apricot. Moreover, PPV was detected in several different Japanese apricot
cultivars and non-grafted seedlings, indicating aphid transmission of the
virus. Our results also show, for the 1st time, that PPV can naturally
infect and spread among Japanese apricot in which only experimental
infection has been reported. Therefore, further investigation of the extent
of yield losses of Japanese apricot fruit due to PPV infection will be
required.

This outbreak of PPV in Japanese apricot raises concerns about a pandemic
spread among other stone fruit species in Japan. We need to investigate the
distribution of PPV in other plant hosts including fruit trees other than
Japanese apricot and weeds throughout Japan carefully and in detail.

[_Plum pox virus_ (PPV; genus _Potyvirus_; also called Sharka virus) is
widely distributed in Europe and also present in parts of Asia, northern
Africa, and the Americas, but absent from Australia and New Zealand. It
affects species in the genus _Prunus_ and may cause up to 100 per cent
yield loss in stone fruit crops. Symptoms on _Prunus_ species can occur on
leaves and fruit. They may include ring or line patterns, mottling and
distortion, and can lead to premature fruit drop and shoot dieback.
Infection may be symptomless in some host species. Some hosts in other
genera are also susceptible including hops, pea, tomato, and a number of
weedy annual plants.

PPV isolates have been grouped into several strains according to their
serological and molecular properties, and some strains do not infect
certain _Prunus_ species. Strain D mentioned above (as well as strain M)
infects peach, plum, and apricot.

PPV is transmitted by a number of aphid species, mechanical inoculation,
grafting, in seed for some host species, but is not known to be transmitted
by pollen or plant-to-plant contact. The importance of herbaceous plants in
the epidemiology of PPV is still being debated. Cuttings of stone fruit
trees pose the greatest risk of introducing the virus to a new area.
Disease management is difficult but may include control of the vector
insects, removal of virus reservoirs, and use of certified planting and
grafting material. Resistant cultivars are available for several stone fruits.

A news story on the 1st report of PPV in Japan earlier this year (see
ProMED-mail post 20100126.0283) also claimed that this was "the world's 1st
known case of naturally transmitted infection." This created confusion
because PPV is known to spread naturally in many locations. The item above
now provides the clarification that this claim was referring to the 1st
report of natural infection in the species _P. mume_.
