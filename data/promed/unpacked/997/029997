Palm Beach County Animal Care and Control [PBCACC or ACC] has quarantined all its dogs after an outbreak of a contagious virus which has been found in other shelters in Florida.

As these dogs wait to be adopted and taken into a loving home, they're now being isolated and kept inside their kennels at Palm Beach County Animal Care and Control as the shelter deals with an outbreak of a highly contagious virus.

"Since this is very transmissible from dog to dog, we're making sure that our dogs don't interact with each other," said Jan Steele with animal control.

Pneumovirus, a fairly new respiratory virus in dogs, was first reported at ACC a few weeks ago during routine testing.

"Because it's novel and we don't have a vaccine for it currently, the dogs just don't have good immunity to it," said Dr. Sara Chapman.

Most signs are mild, including watery eyes, nasal discharge, sneezing and coughing, but it can lead to pneumonia in more severe cases. And recently, more dogs have tested positive at the shelter.

"Over the last few weeks, it started to ramp up and so our positivity rate now is around 17% to 18%. It doesn't get critical until it's over 30%," Steele said.

So now, ACC has stopped all nose-to-nose contact, quarantining the dogs, except for several walks a day.

Individual leashes are now clipped to each kennel, and more wash stations have been installed to help with deep cleaning.

A play yard is usually filled with about 5 to 6 dogs, a place where they can stretch their legs, get exercise, and be a dog. But now to help stop the spread of the virus only one dog is allowed in here at a time."

"From the time there might have been an exposure to the time you're going to see clinical signs is going be less than 7 days," Chapman said.

ACC is looking for more foster families, increasing adoptions, and asking its rescue partners to help take the healthy adoptable dogs out of the building so they don't get infected.

But they should quarantine for at least 2 weeks as a precaution.OOOOoOOOO

[We are saddened the shelter is experiencing such a challenging situation.

This article does not provide details on how the shelter knew it was Pneumovirus or what steps they went through getting it diagnosed. Outbreaks of acute respiratory disease in dogs often involve multiple pathogens.

Pneumoviruses also include respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) often associated with diseases in human being and murine pneumovirus (MPV), traditionally known as pneumonia virus of mice. While there are other Pneumoviruses, the one affecting dogs is most closely related to the mouse or MPV version and a small number of human RSV. This virus was first isolated/studied in around 2010 in dogs.

While the virus has been isolated and identified, and may be more common than we know, it is not often diagnosed, probably because it is from an individual animal or treated symptomatically. However, it really becomes noticeable when large numbers are affected, such as a shelter.

Canine pneumovirus contributes to what is commonly referred to as the canine infectious respiratory disease complex (CIRD). Clinical signs of canine infectious respiratory disease complex (CIRDC) may include sneezing, nasal and ocular discharge, and sometimes lower respiratory and/or systemic disease.

Viral pathogens associated with CIRDC in dogs include:
• Parainfluenza
• Adenovirus-2
• Respiratory coronavirus (this is distinct from canine enteric coronavirus)
• Herpesvirus-1
• Pneumovirus
• And other respiratory syncytial viruses. [Mentioned above.]

Bacterial pathogens implicated in CIRDC include:
• _Bordetella bronchiseptica_
• _Mycoplasma_ spp.
• _Streptococcus zooepidemicus_ (may cause severe systemic disease)

If your pet is having difficulty breathing, listless, depressed, and may not be eating/drinking well, it is advisable to have your pet seen by a veterinarian as soon as possible.

Early treatment can help, as can prevention methods of vaccines to help protect your pet. While there is not currently a vaccine for this virus, there are some vaccines associated with respiratory diseases which may reduce and/or prevent the clinical signs of this disease.
