ANTHRAX VACCINE PRODUCTION TO END - MICHIGAN, USA (03)

I am an employee of the Michigan Biologic Products Institute. While we are
being sold, the intention is for us to continue operating and supplying the
products we now make including both the anthrax vaccine and the immune
globulin product.
One condition of sale is that the buyer must keep all employees for a year,
to winnow out bidders that simply want to close the place.
Market impacts will, of course, depend on the ultimate buyer and their
existing product mix. Our other products include a rabies vaccine and
albumin. We have historically made DPT, but do not have an acellular
component, so we have essentially exited that market. We still make
diphtheria and tetanus components, however.
I hope this helps to clarify the questions being raised.
