Three people have been confirmed dead as a cholera outbreak hits Lagos. The Lagos State Government in a prompt response has moved to stop the spread of the disease.

At an emergency news conference at the Lagos State Government Secretariat, Alausa, in Ikeja, Lagos, Southwest Nigeria on Wednesday [23 Oct 2013], commissioner for health Dr Jide Idris confirmed that 13 cases of cholera infection had been reported and that 3 people have died so far while some had been treated and discharged from the hospital.

Idris explained that investigations carried out by the ministry had revealed that the suspected cases recorded were contracted from food sources such as the African food salad popularly called 'Abasha', well-water sources, especially in areas like Ikare community, Amuwo-Odofin Local Government area and Badia area of Apapa Local Government area, and other infected foods from food sellers, and other unhygienic habits.

Other suspected areas are Ajeromi, Lagos Island, Oshodi-Isolo and Surulere Local Government. He urged members of the public to be vigilant and report any suspected case to the nearest health facility and the Directorate of Disease Control in the state Ministry of Health.

Idris described cholera as an acute contagious bacterial disease that is characterized by severe form of sudden onset of profuse painless watery stools, nausea, and profuse vomiting. He added that cholera is acquired through the ingestion of an infective dose of contaminated food or water and could be transmitted through many mechanisms like direct or indirect contamination of water or food by faeces of infected individuals.

"Cholera should be suspected in any person who develops diarrhoea with or without vomiting, weakness, restlessness, irritability, dry mucous membranes, low blood pressure, leg cramps, excessive loss of body fluids (dehydration), or dies from frequent stooling, hence, adequate measures should be taken in order to reduce the risk of contracting the disease," he stated.

The commissioner listed measures to be taken to reduce the risk of contracting the disease as washing of hands with soaps and water frequently and thoroughly; boiling of water before drinking if the source of the water was in doubts; washing of fruits and vegetables thoroughly before eating; cooking of food thoroughly before eating; disposing of waste material properly; and keeping of water containers clean.

Idris pointed out that in the case of suspected cholera, members of the public should prepare oral rehydration solution (10 level teaspoonfuls of sugar and one level teaspoonful of salt in two 35cl bottles); give the patient a lot of fluids to drink; keep giving the patient food as soon as it can be tolerated; and thereafter visit the nearest hospital whether the condition of the patient improves or not.

He urged health workers to be on the alert and report suspected outbreaks of more than 5 cases in their facilities to the State Ministry of Health, saying that people could also call the following numbers: 08023169485 or 0802321333 for assistance.

[ProMED-mail posted on 11 Sep 2013 (see archive 20130911.1937972): "Nigeria suffered cholera epidemics during the rainy seasons of 2010 and 2011 [typically April to September], with nearly 2000 people killed over 2 years. While 2012 saw few reported infections, health officials warn that Nigeria remains vulnerable to further outbreaks because of its high population density and poor sanitation in many areas."

As late in the season as November 2012, ProMED-mail posted (see archive 20121126.1424886): "42 people have been hospitalized as a result of the outbreak of the disease. The outbreak of cholera disease was recorded in Ede North and South local government areas of Osun state and is also said to have been responsible for the death of some other residents of the town."

Lagos city has an estimated population of 21 million, and the airport is an international hub for flights to other Africa countries and all over the world, so both national and international public health implications are huge.

But cholera is easily treated with oral rehydration solution (which can be home-made following the recipe in the report above) and if the patient does not improve, doxycycline or tetracycline. - Mod.JW

Lagos becomes the 4th state after Sokoto, Oyo, and Plateau to report cholera cases in a period of 2 months. This outbreak justifies the need to strengthen cholera preparedness and response in both affected and at-risk states.
