According to doctors at the Siaya County Referral Hospital, the 20-year-old man was brought to the facility bleeding from several orifices and exhibiting other symptoms of the disease [Rift Valley fever]. He had been referred to the hospital from a health centre in Uriri village in Alego Usonga, where he had been undergoing treatment for one week.

The county director of health, Samwuel Omondi, said samples taken from the man and sent to the Kenya Medical Research Institute revealed that he had the Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus. "This is the 1st case to be reported in this county. It is uncommon in Nyanza and the western region and that is why we strongly believe the floods caused it."

A team of health practitioners has been dispatched to Uriri and its environs, as well as other parts of the county, to conduct surveillance, increase public awareness and monitor the situation.

Affected areas
Residents in the affected areas have been advised to only eat inspected livestock products, including milk and meat, as health officials consult with the livestock department on the way forward. Mr Omondi said one could get infected through handling of sick animals, either by slaughtering or assisting the animals during labour.

"The other mode of transmission from animals, which is relatively low, is by mosquitoes and other insect bites. We, therefore, encourage everyone not to handle sick animals. Do not slaughter them without alerting veterinary teams or public health officers. We also encourage the use of mosquito nets."

The 1st outbreak of RVF, which has left several people dead, was reported in the northern regions of the country earlier this month.

[A confirmed case of Rift Valley fever (RVF) has now occurred in yet another county, in Uriri, an electoral constituency in Migori County, in far southwestern Kenya. This county is far from Wajir county in the north, the county where RVF cases have been occurring in humans and domestic animals (camels, goats and sheep). The prolonged rains mentioned in the above report have doubtless provided breeding sites for RFV virus vector mosquitoes. The advice to the public to only consume inspected animal products is prudent. Given the human case, apparently with no travel history outside of the area, it is likely that domestic animals there are infected as well, even though animal cases are not mentioned in the above report. The increase surveillance by the meeical team will be helpful in detecting any additional human and animal cases. - Mod. TY

Kenya is endemic for Rift Valley fever (RVF) in livestock, in particular in some central and eastern areas considered at higher risk of disease spreading. WHO considers the high number of reported deaths and abortions in livestock of concern, especially because the event affects nomadic communities for which diet is predominantly based on animal products. The high volume of movement of cattle and people in this area increases the risk of further spread of the outbreak both within Kenya, and to neighboring countries.

Subsequent to the explosive RVF event in Kenya, the disease has been claimed to be circulating in Rwanda. If confirmed, this will raise concerns for the spread of the disease further in Rwanda and beyond and may allow to think to a series of unreported infections on-going across the whole Eastern Africa region. - Mod.AS
