The vector-borne deadly Japanese encephalitis (JE) toll in eastern
Uttar Pradesh today reached 361, following the deaths of 3 more
children in the last 24 hours. Official sources said so far, 2354 JE
patients had reported at the Baba Raghav Das Medical College here and
other district hospitals in the division, of which 361, including 38
from Bihar and one from Nepal had died.

Since yesterday, 31 new JE cases had come to light. Almost 272 JE
patients were still convalescing at the various hospitals. The newest
deaths included one each of Gorakhpur, Kushinagar and Bihar.

[The death toll from viral encephalitis in the UP continues to
steadily mount, having increased from 346 on 25 Sep 2010 to 361 in
this report. Once again, this report implies that all cases are due to
Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus. However, previous reports indicate
that not all cases are due to Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) and
the majority are caused by a different virus (perhaps an enterovirus).

[It would be interesting to know the age group and JE vaccination
status of the cases. - Mod.JW]
