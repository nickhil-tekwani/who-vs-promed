PENGUINS - SOUTH AFRICA (6)
===========================
Domoic acid and birds:

One should be careful about concluding that penguins were affected by
domoic acid (DA) until you're certain you've ruled out other causes of
CNS signs ... particularly in birds exposed to oil. I've found that in
seabirds affected by DA, there is little characteristic pathology.
Should you want to pursue this route, an additional reference may be
helpful that gives details on epizootiology of DA in seabirds:

Work et al. 1993. Epidemiology of domoic acid poisoning in brown
pelicans and Brandt's cormorants in California. J. Zoo. Wildlife.
Medicine. 24: 54-62.
