Moldova's government is following the spread of bird flu, Prime
Minister Vasile Tarlev said, meeting with ambassadors, EU, US, and UN
officials and members of international donor organizations Friday [4 Nov 2005].

"The government is following the spread of bird flu and has taken
relevant measures, particularly in the regions [?]," Tarlev said.

No bird flu cases have been reported in Moldova, but the authorities
are alarmed by the possible spread of the disease from neighboring
Romania where it has been registered already.

The government set up commissions to oversee preventive efforts, and
all services involved have been engaged in those efforts. The
republic's agriculture minister held discussions on the matter with
his counterparts from Ukraine and Romania.

Tarlev said the government would update regional and international
organizations on measures being taken in Moldova to deter the
pandemic and inform the donors if their aid was needed.

The ambassadors expressed willingness to provide financial aid and
advise Moldova on its campaign against a possible bird flu outbreak,
the Russian information agency reported.

[2] Singapore: precautionary measures

As Asian governments keep a lookout for new cases of bird flu,
Singapore is deploying some unlikely "flu police" at the world's
largest bird park: chickens.

Singapore's Jurong Bird Park has put 19 chickens, known as "sentinel
chickens", in all its aviaries to help detect the presence of any
infectious disease.

"These chickens are bred without any immunity. So they will be the
1st ones to fall ill if there is an outbreak of bird flu or other
infectious diseases at the park," Wong Hon Mun, executive director of
Jurong Bird Park, told Reuters.

He said the chickens are bred from birds that have never been
vaccinated against any disease and so act as a first line of defence
against bird flu or any other illness brought in by wild birds.

Since 2004 the park has started vaccinating all other birds and
giving flu jabs to its staff. It has also introduced foot baths and
disinfecting floor mats to reduce the risk of spreading the virus.

Wong said the park has done scenario planning with the Agri-Food and
Veterinary Authority, and added that if any of its captive birds were
found to have contracted bird flu, the park would have to cull all
the birds in that particular aviary.

"They will have to be put down, whether it's the toucans or birds of
paradise," Wong said. "It is a very tough decision. But the thinking
is that it has to be done because we are talking about possible
transmission to humans."

The park has more than 9000 birds of 600 species including such
endangered ones as the Toco Toucans, Caribbean Flamingos and
Dalmatian Pelicans. Vets check the birds daily.

The park -- the world's largest in terms of number of birds and 2nd
largest in terms of land area after Germany's Vogelpark Walsrode --
would temporarily shut down if there were an outbreak.

Despite growing fears about bird flu, Wong said visitor arrivals had
not dipped. "In fact, the number of visitors has increased by about
20 percent this year compared to last year," he said.

Although Singapore is currently free of bird flu, there are
increasing concerns that imported birds could carry the deadly virus
onto its shores.

Britain said in October 2005 that a parrot that died in quarantine
tested positive for H5N1. The authorities believe the parrot was
infected in Taiwan. [This has been refuted by the Taiwanese;
preliminarily, their denial is in line with initial investigations by
the British authorities. Final results of the investigation are
pending. - Mod.AS]

Wong said the park has stopped all bird imports and exports since
March last year and any new bird imports would have to fulfil
government regulations.

[The use of sentinels in zoos or open-air parks for the detection of
newly-introduced exotic disease agents, such as avian influenza or
Newcastle disease, is an interesting application of a technique which
has previously been used mainly in commercial farms.

Some examples, included in previous ProMED-mail postings: In 1995,
Mexico -- suffering an H5N2 outbreak -- used sentinels, kept in AI
vaccinated poultry farms, to monitor the efficacy of the vaccine and
to detect new infections. During the 2003 epizootic of highly
pathogenic H7N7 avian influenza in the Netherlands, repopulation of
the culled affected holdings was allowed only after "sentinel birds"
demonstrated that the virus was no longer present in the holding. In
Hong Kong, the 1st territory in southeast Asia which detected human
infections with H5N1 (as early as 1997), all chicken farms are
routinely vaccinated with inactivated H5N2 vaccine, and each batch of
chickens has 60 unvaccinated individually identified sentinels
monitored throughout the production life of the batch. Hong Kong also
conducts an extensive virus culture and surveillance in bird parks
and in captive birds.

Singapore's decision to use sentinels is a creative solution to a
specific situation when direct or indirect contacts (e.g. droppings)
between the avian population of local parks on the one side, and wild
or migratory birds on the other side, cannot be prevented. In
contrast, commercial poultry are isolated from wild birds by their
housing, while indirect contacts can be prevented by adequate
biosecurity measures. - Mod.AS]

[3] China, Liaoning: migratory birds

The latest outbreak of bird flu, which has killed 8940 chickens in
Northeast China's Liaoning Province, has been brought under control,
the provincial government said on Fri 4 Nov 2005. [map:

The 4th case of infection China has reported in a month may have been
caused by migratory birds, the Ministry of Agriculture said. No human
deaths have been reported in the outbreak.

Minister Du Qinglin and a team of experts have rushed to the scene of
the outbreak in Gongtai Village, Badaohao Town of Heishan County, a
ministry statement said.

Heishan County lies around 300 kilometres northeast of Beijing and is
on the migratory bird route from East Asia to Australia. More than 20
magpies and other wild birds have been found dead in the county,
according to Fu Jingwu, deputy chief of the Liaoning Provincial
Animal Health Supervision Administration.

"The source of the outbreak might be from migratory birds," the
ministry's statement quoted unidentified experts as saying.

In line with state law, local agricultural and health authorities
have culled 369 900 poultry within a 3-kilometre radius of the
outbreak site and vaccinated 13.9 million others, the statement said.

Areas affected by the epidemic have been cordoned off and 30 checking
stations and disinfection points set up around them. More than 3000
personnel and 50 tons of disinfectant were deployed.

The provincial government has earmarked 5 million yuan (USD 625 000)
as compensation to local farmers for the loss of their birds.

The death of some chickens was first detected at household farms in
Badaohao Town on 26 Oct 2005. At first, local vets suspected
Newcastle disease was to blame, and reported the cases to the
Liaoning animal health agency.

On 1 Nov 2005, the agency said they were suspicious the problem was
avian influenza.

On Thursday [3 Nov 2005] the National Avian Influenza Reference
Laboratory confirmed the Liaoning case involved the deadly H5N1
strain of bird flu, according to a report the ministry sent to the
Paris-based World Organization for Animal Health.

Besides the measures taken in Heishan County, Liaoning plans to
implement a thorough check of birds for flu and carry out emergency
immunisations of all poultry in the province, according to Fu.

He said supervision of transportation and logistics will be enhanced
to prevent infected chickens and eggs from entering markets. "Up
until now, the epidemic is still under control in Heishan," Fu said.

Liang Chuancheng, a biology professor at the local Shenyang Normal
University, said now is the peak time for migratory birds in Liaoning
Province, one of the major stopovers in northern Asia.

Birds first started flocking into Liaoning in mid-October 2005. Most
come from Siberia and usually stay in Liaoning for 1-2 weeks,
according to Liang.

They then fly along the coastline to the south. But the prolonged
autumn this year because of comparatively high temperatures has meant
many wild fowl choose to stay in Liaoning for a longer time.

Liang said the migratory birds will leave at the end of this month
when the temperature plummets below zero degrees Centigrade [32 Fahrenheit].

Elsewhere, health departments in Guangdong Province and Hong Kong
agreed on Thursday to reinforce co-operation in monitoring and
reporting any outbreak of public health events including flu, bird
flu and other new diseases, according to the Guangdong Provincial
Health Department.

In Shanghai, the authorities are planning to build an advanced animal
disease prevention and control centre, equipped with a bio-safety
level 3 laboratory (P3 Lab), to strengthen tracking and research of
the sources of animal diseases and enhance warning capacity.

It is believed the centre will markedly improve Shanghai's
early-warning capacity against animal diseases, in order to prevent
and control disastrous diseases like bird flu, said Zhang Suhua,
deputy director of the municipal agriculture commission's animal
husbandry office, on Friday.

[According to Avibase Bird Checklists of the World, the denomination
"magpie" is used for 6 species of Chinese birds belonging to the
family _Corvidae_ , in addition to the common Eurasian magpie (_Pica
pica_). The other species are: Azure-winged Magpie (_Cyanopica
cyana_), Gold-billed Magpie (_Urocissa flavirostris_), Blue Magpie
(_Urocissa erythrorhyncha_), White-winged Magpie (_Urocissa
whiteheadi_), Green Magpie (_Cissa chinensis_), and Yellow-breasted
Magpie (_Cissa hypoleuca_). Accurate identification of the "magpies"
reportedly affected by H5N1 in the current outbreak might be useful
in evaluating their respective role in the spread of the virus. - Mod.AS]
