Two more Michigan county fairs, 1 in Cass County and 1 in Ingham County, are reporting variant H3N2 (H3N2v) influenza in pigs, according to a media release from the Van Buren/Cass District Health Department. No ill human contacts have been reported, according to state health officials.

A total of 20 pigs tested positive for H3N2v at the Cass County fair, which took place from 31 Jul to 6 Aug 2016. More than 300 pigs were exhibited. The 1st pig tested positive on 9 Aug 2016.

On 6 Aug 2016, one pig that was exhibited at the Ingham County fair tested positive for swine flu. Last month [July 2016] a pig at the Muskegon county fair also tested positive for H3N2v.

Humans are at risk for swine flu if they come in close contact with infected pigs, but H3N2v usually causes only mild illness when transmitted to people.

[These incidents of flu in swine have been confirmed to be caused by H3N2v influenza virus, as was discovered in the previous Michigan county fair [see ProMED-mail posting 20160807.4399461].

While no human cases have currently been identified at this particular fair, the issue of sick swine is concerning. Hopefully, the show veterinarian was involved in the case very early on, but this is not clear.

Hopefully the people closest to the animal are being monitored, as the exposure source is again close contact with pigs, as previously reported (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23794729). - Mod.TG
