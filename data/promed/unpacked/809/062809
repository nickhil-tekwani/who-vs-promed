More than 100 children from a kindergarten in Southwest China's Chongqing municipality have been hospitalized after unexplained petechiae were found on their lower limbs, local health authorities said Thursday [11 Apr 2013].

So far, a total of 115 children from the Guji Kindergarten, in Changsha township of Kaixian county, have been taken to 3 local hospitals for treatment and observation, sources with the county's public health emergency response center said. Blood and urine samples have been sent to Chongqing city and Beijing for tests.

Local health authorities carried out a thorough check of all of the roughly 300 children in the privately-owned kindergarten after some of them showed the symptoms on Wednesday [10 Apr 2013].

All the hospitalized children are in stable condition. Among them, 2 are in relatively serious but not life-threatening condition, according to the sources.

Health experts have initially ruled out the possibility of contagion.

Health experts from local authorities as well as the National Health and Family Planning Commission have begun a coordinated investigation into the cause of the disease outbreak.

Health authorities in southwest China's Chongqing Municipality suspect that rat poison caused petechiae in over 100 kindergarten students.

Judging from the clinical manifestations, therapeutic effects, epidemiological investigation, and the lab test results, the petechiae found on the children's lower limbs may be due to their ingestion of a rat poison that stops blood from clotting, an official with the municipal health department said Friday [12 Apr 2013].

A total of 117 children from the Guji Kindergarten, located in Changsha Township, Kaixian County, have been hospitalized with red and purple blotches beneath the skin of their lower limbs since Wednesday [10 Apr 2013].

Health authorities have organized a group of experts to establish a treatment program. The effects of the treatment have been apparent, and the students' symptoms are expected to clear up within a week, said the official. Police and health authorities are probing the source of the poisoning.

Guji is a privately-owned kindergarten with about 300 students.

[There are numerous rodenticides, or rat poisons as they are commonly called. The most common ones are anticoagulant-based products, meaning they cause some kind of bleeding or clotting disorder. Anticoagulants act by blocking vitamin K clotting factors, especially factors II (prothrombin) and VII (proconvertin), causing the body to be unable to produce clotting factors.

There are 1st and 2nd generation anticoagulant rodenticides. 2nd generation rodenticides are more potent than 1st generation ones. Rodenticides are also divided by class of compound. The coumarin class includes warfarin and coumatetraly. Also included in this class as 2nd generation are difenacoum, brodifacoum, flocoumafen, and bromadiolone. The next class are the 1,3 indandiones. This includes chlorophacinone and diphacinone. Difethialone is also regarded as a 2nd generation anticoagulant.

The most effective treatment for anticoagulants is vitamin K. Hopefully, these children will get appropriate treatment and be healthy soon.

How did this many children all ingest rodenticide? Was it something that was included in their food? Did they believe it to be some type of candy?
