[According to the report above, a total of 82 918 cases of confirmed COVID-19 have now been reported from mainland China, including 4633 deaths, representing an increase of 17 cases in the 24 hours since yesterday's (9 May 2020) report. The newly reported cases included 7 imported cases and 10 local transmission associated cases. The imported cases were all reported by Inner Mongolia. The 10 cases associated with local transmission include 5 cases in Hubei (?Wuhan), 3 in Jilin (see section [4]A in today's global update COVID-19 update (172): global, ACE inh, ARBs, China & South Korea clusters, WHO 20200511.7321973), 1 each in Liaoning and Heilongjiang provinces. In Hong Kong, where numbers of newly confirmed cases had been reported daily, 3 newly confirmed cases were reported in the past 24 hours. Macau has reported no newly confirmed cases. It appears as though local transmission is occurring in multiple provinces. Information is not provided as to whether the investigated chain of transmission of these cases leads back to imported cases or if there may have been (and may continue to be) undetected transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic individuals who had unidentified contact with other asymptomatic infected individuals.

There were 12 newly confirmed infections in asymptomatic people in the past 24 hours, all locally acquired cases. There were 6 cases of conversion from asymptomatic to symptomatic in the past 24 hours, again, all locally acquired cases. The total number of asymptomatic individuals currently under observation (and isolation) is 780, and 44 of these are importations from abroad. It would be helpful to know what proportion of asymptomatic infected individuals went on to be symptomatic, in order to start developing projections of actual infection rates and adjust reported case fatality ratios accordingly. It is apparent that there is most likely thorough contact tracing and testing to explain the daily reports of asymptomatic infections in addition to the screening of individuals arriving from overseas.

As reported on 24 Mar 2020, China ended the lockdown in Hubei and elsewhere, and ended it in Wuhan on 7 Apr 2020. The past 2 days have shown an increase in locally transmitted cases both in Hubei province (?and possibly in Wuhan). The world is watching carefully to see whether this is safe timing. While there had been locally transmitted cases in both Guangdong and Heilongjiang that are of concern, there was one new reported case in Guangdong on 6 May 2020 and 1 report of a case in Heilongjiang today (10 May 2020]. In recent days, the main concern was importations. One suspects that has somewhat changed with the increase in reported locally transmitted cases in the past few days.

Update on importations:
Regions/Country: Newly confirmed cases / Total
China: 0 / 19 (1.7%)
Asia ex-China: 2 / 154 (13.7%)
Europe: 1 / 462 (41.0%)
Americas: 2 / 485 (43.0%)
Africa: 3 / 6 (0.5%)
Australia: 0 / 1 (0.1%)

Total: 8 / 1127

- In addition to the continuous importation of cases from Europe and Americas, the number of imported cases from Middle East and Africa has also increased recently. Therefore, entry screening procedure will be strengthened once again. Currently, incoming travelers from abroad other than the United States and Europe get tested only when they have symptoms while those from the United states and Europe get tested within 3 days of their arrival. According to the strengthened procedure, however, every inbound traveler should get tested within 14 days upon their arrival regardless of symptoms.

- With regard to local transmission, 26 additional cases have been confirmed, of which 24 were identified from the investigation on Itaewon club cases (18 = a visit history to the clubs, 6 = contacts) and 2 were sporadic cases in Daegu City.

*As of 12:00, [10 May 2020], 11 more cases have been confirmed in relation to Itaewon clubs, bringing the total number of cases to 54. (Regional distribution: 30 = Seoul, 14 = Gyeonggi, 6 = Incheon, 2 = Chungbuk, 1 = Busan, 1 = Jeju / Distribution by chain of transmission : 43 = a visit history to the club, 11 = contacts including family and co-workers)

- KCDC noted that anyone who visited clubs in Itaewon District (in Yongsan-gu, Seoul) from the end of April [2020] to [6 May 2020] are likely to have been exposed to the virus. KCDC asked these people to:
-- stay home;
-- contact a local public health center or dial 1339 (KCDC call center) and follow the instructions of the public health center.

- KCDC also asked local health authority and healthcare facilities to check a contact or visit history of patients and conduct a diagnostic test for COVID-19 regardless of symptoms when necessary.

- Regarding 2 cases confirmed in Daegu City, one was identified during the application process of Social Support Project for the Elderly, and the other was tested when admitted to Kyungpook National University Hospital (Chilgok branch) on [8 May 2020] due to non-COVID-19 related illness. The case developed a cough on [25 Apr 2020]. Epidemiological investigation is currently underway.

- According to the administrative order issued on [8 May 2020], nightlife venues, such as clubs and bars, are advised to refrain from operation. If remaining in operation, they should follow infection prevention and control guidelines:
-- wear a facemask;
-- keep 1 or 2-meter distance from one another;
-- keep a log of visitors and check their temperature and presence of respiratory symptoms at the entrance;
-- ventilate and disinfect the space at least twice a day.

- KCDC reminded and urged everyone to comply with 5 Basic Infection Prevention Rules for Everyone:
-- stay home for 3-4 days if you get sick.;
-- keep a distance of 2 arms' length between you and other people;
-- wash your hands for 30 seconds. Cough/sneeze into your sleeve;
-- ventilate your space at least twice a day and disinfect regularly;
-- keep in touch with family and friends even while maintaining physical distancing.

- KCDC recommends religious communities to utilize non-face-to-face methods of gathering such as online streaming. Religious communities that meet host gatherings on sight need to check people for elevated temperature, maintain distance between people, have people wear facemasks, and refrain from providing meals to eat together or activities that cause respiratory droplets to disperse such as singing or shouting.

- KCDC reminded the public to stay home and not go to work if having fever or respiratory symptoms and to call the KCDC call center (1339 or area code + 120) or contact a local public health center if having prolonging fever over 38 degrees or aggravating respiratory symptoms.

- KCDC urged people to visit a screening center to get tested especially if 2 or more persons within a household unit or travel group unit develop COVID-19 suspected symptoms.

[In the past 24 hours, the tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea has increased by 35 cases and 0 deaths compared with yesterday's 24-hour period (9 to 10 May 2020) when there were 34 newly confirmed cases and 0 deaths. A total of 10 909 confirmed cases and 256 deaths were reported today (10 May 2020), up from 10 874 cases and 256 deaths yesterday (9 May 2020). The daily newly confirmed case count has been at or below 100 for 38 consecutive days and below 50 for 31 consecutive days. For several days, the count was below 10 but started climbing over the last 3 days. Of concern is that all but 6 of the newly confirmed cases were locally transmitted today (10 May 2020) and 8 yesterday (9 May 2020). 20 of the 35 newly confirmed cases were in Seoul, and 4 were in Gyeonggi, 3 were in Chungbuk, 3 were in Incheon (1 imported and 2 locally acquired). Other provinces reporting single cases were Sejong and, Gongwon -- both were imported cases. Further details on the 35 newly confirmed cases are not as yet available to know how many were associated with the nightclub district. Clearly there is concern of an increasing 2nd wave associated with relaxing the stay at home policy (see section [4]B in today's global update COVID-19 update (172): global, ACE inh, ARBs, China & South Korea clusters, WHO 20200511.7321973)

Demographics on the 10 909 cases reported thus far and details on the cases reported through 0.00 10 May 2020 are presented on the English language website at the URL above. The Itaewon club district in Seoul has had 54 cases now identified (as of end of 0:00 on 10 May 2020) associated with the district, including club attendees, and their families and coworkers.

As they move to the next phase -- "distancing in daily life" -- all eyes will be on the country to see whether they can maintain the level of control they have had. Importations continue to be the main problem at this time. With the outbreak associated with the Itaewon club district in Seoul, there may be a rethinking of next steps.

[The tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy is now 219 070 cases, including 30 560 deaths, up from 218 268 cases and 30 395 deaths reported on 9 May 2020. The 24-hour change between 9 and 10 May 2020 was 802 newly confirmed cases, compared with 1083 newly confirmed cases between 8 and 9 May 2020 -- a gradual but steady decrease continuing. The numbers of hospitalized cases and cases in the ICU are also experiencing a decline.

Cases still continue to be concentrated in the northern part of the country, in Lombardy, the epicenter of the outbreak, Emilia-Romagna, Veneto, and Piedmont. These 4 provinces combined account for 65.6% of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. Lombardy is the main contributor, representing 35.2% of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. In addition to Lombardy, Piedmont is the only province reporting 100 or more newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. 8 provinces reported less than 10 newly confirmed cases, and another 8 provinces reported fewer than 50 newly confirmed cases, all signs of decreasing local transmission. Emilia-Romagna, Veneto, and Liguria are the only 3 provinces reporting 50 or more cases (but less than 100).

There is an excellent interactive map at http://opendatadpc.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/b0c68bce2cce478eaac82fe38d4138b1 to visualize the caseloads per region in near real time.

On 9 Mar 2020, Italy announced a lockdown for the northern provinces, where the outbreak was concentrated. On 10 Mar 2020, this was expanded to be countrywide. On 11 Mar 2020, Italy announced the closure of non-essential businesses. It is now 62 days since the start of the lockdown in the north and 61 days since the countrywide lockdown. The lockdown was extended through 3 May 2020 (see ProMED-mail post 20200411.7211958 for details). All eyes are now on Italy as lockdown restrictions are phased out.

[4] Iran: 107 603 total cases, 6640 deaths
Date: Mon 11 May 2020
Source: The National (UAE), Reuters report [edited]
https://www.thenational.ae/world/mena/iran-locks-down-south-west-county-after-surge-in-coronavirus-cases-1.1017579


A county in south-western Iran has been placed under lockdown to prevent the spread of coronavirus [COVID-19] after sharp rise in new cases across the province. Gholamreza Shariati, Governor of Khuzestan province, which borders Iraq and includes the county of Abadan, told state news agency Tasnim that people had not been observing social distancing rules. "Because of this the number of corona patients in the province has tripled and the hospitalisation of patients has risen by 60 per cent," Mr Shariati said.

Banks and offices in Abadan will be closed until the end of the week and entry corridors to the county from the north and east have been closed, Tasnim reported. Offices will be closed and travel restrictions will also apply to 9 other counties in oil-rich Khuzestan, Mr Shariati said.

Iran, one of the countries in the Middle East hit hardest by the coronavirus, has begun easing restrictions on normal life to keep afloat its economy, which was already battered by US sanctions. But health officials have repeatedly warned that easing restrictions could lead to a boost in the number of infections.

Schools will open next week [week of 18 May 2020], President Hassan Rouhani said on Sunday [10 May 2020]. On Friday [8 May 2020], after a 2-month suspension, prayer gatherings resumed in up to 180 Iranian cities and towns considered to be at low risk of coronavirus contagion. The resumption of Friday prayers, which is still banned in the capital Tehran and some other major cities, followed the reopening last Monday [4 May 2020] of 132 mosques in areas consistently free of the virus.

Coronavirus infections in Tehran are still rising, a local official told the Isna news agency on Sunday [10 May 2020].

The number of coronavirus deaths rose by 51 in the past 24 hours to 6640, Health Ministry spokesman Kianush Jahanpur said on state TV on Sunday [10 May 2020]. A total 107 603 cases have been diagnosed, Mr Jahanpur said.

The oil price crash is a further challenge, Vice President Eshaq Jahangiri told the government website. "The sanctions, corona, the drop in oil prices and a slump in the global economy have placed perilous conditions in front of the national economy," Mr Jahangiri said. "Of course these conditions don't mean a dead end, but the country's leaders must use different approaches and capacities to solve the challenges ahead."

[In the 24 hours from 9 to 10 May 2020, the total number of cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Iran grew from 106 220 to 107 603, an increase of 1383 compared with 1529 newly confirmed cases reported yesterday (9 May 2020). The number of deaths has increased from 6589 to 6640, an increase of 51 deaths in the 24-hour period. In terms of total numbers of confirmed cases, Iran ranks 10th globally, behind the USA, Spain, the UK, Italy, Russia, France, Germany, Brazil, and Turkey. As with other countries that are lifting business closures, all eyes are on Iran now that "low risk" businesses are opening, and, unfortunately, it appears as though the opening may have been premature. A caution is that there is usually a 2-3 week lag between increasing cases and increases in reported deaths, so relying on the daily number of deaths at this point may be premature as well. Other countries that are rushing to reopen their economies might look at Iran to learn from its experience.

[The above are the latest breakdowns of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the USA, as per Worldometer data. The total number of confirmed cases in the USA and territories is now 1 367 638, including 80 787 deaths, an increase from 1 347 309 cases and 80 037 deaths in the past 24 hours. New York state, with 345 406 (25.3%) cumulative case reports and 1997 (9.8%) newly confirmed cases over the past 24 hours, is still clearly the epicenter of the outbreak in the USA, although case reporting elsewhere is increasing. New York City had a cumulative total of 178 766 as of 1:45 PM on 10 May 2020, including 14 753 confirmed deaths and an additional 5178 probable deaths (https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data.page).

Daily reported case counts are high in Illinois (1656 -- 8.2% of total), New Jersey (1429 -- 7.0%), Pennsylvania (1370 -- 6.7%), Texas (1248 -- 6.1%), California (1230 -- 6.1%), Massachusetts (1050 -- 5.2%), and Maryland (1053 -- 5.2%). In terms of cumulative case reports, New York is number one, followed by New Jersey, Massachusetts, Illinois, California, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Florida, Texas, and Connecticut.

Repeating from previous days, more sobering, if you treat each state as a country and insert them in descending cumulative case counts, New York state would be number 1, followed by Spain, UK, Italy, Russia, France, Germany, Brazil, New Jersey, and Turkey as number 10. Number 11 would be Iran, 12 China, 13 Massachusetts, 14 Illinois, 15 Canada, 16 California, 17 Peru, 18 India, 19 Pennsylvania, and 20 Belgium. 6 US states are in the top 20 in terms of cumulative case counts (concept from - Mod.LXL). Even more sobering is that New York City itself would be between France and Russia (it would be number 6). These rankings of USA states have not changed in the past several days.

The US military has confirmed 7826 cumulative cases, with no newly confirmed cases in the past 48 hours (most likely due to weekend artifact). The Veteran Affairs reported 10 952 cumulative cases and 75 new cases today (10 May 2020). There have been 3580 cases reported from federal prisons (no new cases in the past 24 hours - weekend artifact) and 2973 cases reported from the Navajo Nation (97 newly reported cases in the past 24 hours). Puerto Rico has reported 2198 cases (25 new cases in the past 24 hours). Other states with increased activity include Georgia with 926 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, Virginia with 885 newly confirmed cases, Florida with 595 newly confirmed cases, and Connecticut with 570 newly confirmed cases. 27 states and entities have reported more than 10 000 cumulative cases each.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html) has a growth curve and a table giving demographics (age and ethnicity) where known.

[As per the WHO Situation Report 98 from 27 Apr 2020 (https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200427-sitrep-98-covid-19.pdf and in COVID-19 update (136): UK NHS increased testing, Brazil, WHO 20200428.7274496), Spain has been reporting only PCR positive confirmations, and not antibody based tests, to WHO, since 25 Apr 2020. The antibody-confirmed cases are now available in Table 4, which presents all cases including all tests performed. There were 621 newly confirmed cases by PCR in the 24-hour period from 9 to 10 May 2020, bringing the PCR [plus number confirmed including all tests] confirmed cumulative total to 224 390 [262 783] as compared with 223 578 [262 783] confirmed cases on 9 May 2020.

The countrywide 2-week incidence per 100 000 population continues to decrease and is now 32.7, a continual slow decrease over the past 28 days from a high of 214.4 on 7 Apr 2020 to 32.7 today (10 May 2020). Spain has the highest case count in Europe and is 2nd globally behind the USA in terms of absolute numbers of cases. Figure 1 at the source URL above shows the daily confirmations juxtaposed with dates of onset of disease, and one clearly sees the trend for decreasing confirmations in recent times. There is also a clear growth curve showing the trajectory of the epidemic at https://covid19.isciii.es/; it is updated daily.

Of the 224 390 [264 670] cases, an additional 465 cases have been hospitalized, and an additional 36 cases were admitted to ICU (half of the number admitted to the ICU on 9 May 2020). 9.2% of hospitalized patients have been admitted to ICU.

A map of Spain showing provinces (autonomous communities) can be seen at https://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/map/spain-administrative-map.htm and a HealthMap/ProMED-mail map at https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=7321974,43. Castile and Leon, Catalonia, and Navarre, all in the northern part of the country, are the most affected communities by population-based rates. - Mod.MPP]
