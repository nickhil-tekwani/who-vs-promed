Alan Winde, Minister of Economic Opportunities, explained that 3 more horses on Schoongezicht, the Paarl farm where the 1st case was detected, had tested positive for African Horse Sickness. "4 horses on 4 other properties also tested positive. Of these 4 horses, 2 have died." Minister Winde said the current containment zone, as revised last week [25 Apr - 1 May 2016], would remain in place until further notice.

"All the cases took place within the containment zone. At the start of the outbreak our vets predicted that if the illness should spread it would do so in the direction of the wind, which carries the midges. That's exactly what we have seen happen here. Vets will continue with their surveillance programme, which includes ongoing testing."

Minister Winde added that controlling the outbreak was a key priority for the Western Cape Department of Agriculture. "Currently, we are exporting our horses to the European Union (EU) via Mauritius. This results in additional transport and logistics costs. As a result of these cases, it is highly unlikely we will be able to apply to have the movement ban to the EU lifted for at least another 2 years."

"At the end of last year [2015], the largest consignment of horses ever was exported from the Western Cape to the United Arab Emirates and Europe, with the assistance of this department's Veterinary Services programme. To increase these kinds of successes, we will attempt to ensure that our animal population remains disease-free and that we respond speedily to outbreaks if they should occur. In this financial year, we will invest R86 million [South African Rand] [USD 5.9 million] to reach these objectives."

Private veterinarians in the affected area have also been requested to inform the state vets of any suspected AHS cases or cases indicative of infectious disease both within the containment area and within the AHS surveillance zone.

Horse owners are encouraged to stable their horses from 2 hours before sunset to 2 hours after dawn to decrease the risk of the vector of the disease having contact with their horses; Vets also appeal to owners to use a registered insect repellent on their horses during the vector feeding periods as indicated above.

Further protection of the stabled horses can be attained by covering all stable openings with 80-100 percent shade cloth. Any owner within the AHS surveillance zone detecting illness in horses involving unexplained fever, swelling of the head and neck and difficulty breathing should report the case to their local State Veterinarian as quickly as possible. Contact details of regional state veterinary offices can be found on <www.elsenburg.com>.

[The location of the index case can be seen in the middle of the containment zone as presented on the revised map, issued 26 Apr 2016 http://www.elsenburg.com/sites/default/files/news/african%20horse%20sickenss/Revised%20AHS%20containment%20zone%2026%20April%202016.pdf.

The identity of the new 4 locations has not become available. The above media report included also the following note: "The roads that make up the borders of the containment area are not included in the movement restrictions, and transport of horses along these roads is permitted".

AHS virus is an orbivirus, transmitted by _Culicoides_ midges. A review, updated 2015, is available at
http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/african_horse_sickness.pdf.

On 3 May 2016, South Africa submitted to the OIE follow-up report No 1; adding one new case, out of 37 susceptible horses at the same location of the index case. See, with map, at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapEventSummary&reportid=20126.

The above follow-up report indicated that the serotype was still "pending". ProMED-mail's information on the agent's being serotyped AHS-1 was based upon DEFRA's assessment (posting 20160502.4196444). - Mod.AS
