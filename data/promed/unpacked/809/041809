ANGIOSTRONGYLUS, FOXES - CANADA (NEWFOUNDLAND): REQUEST FOR INFO

From: Whitney, Hugh AGRI <HWhitney@agric.dffa.gov.nf.ca>

On the island of Newfoundland, we have been seeing infections with the
lungworm, _Angiostrongylus vasorum_, in both wild foxes and hunting dogs
(that have never left the island) for a number of years now. This disease
(also called French Heartworm) is not to my knowledge considered enzootic
anywhere else in North America.
Is anyone else aware of its presence elsewhere in N. America in other than
imported animals? I can't see that our history or climate is significantly
different from many other spots on the eastern coast of N. America such
that we would be the only recipients.
Any comments?
