First report of grapevine viroids in the East Mediterranean region of Turkey
M. Gazel and N. Onelge <monagazel@hotmail.com>, Department of Plant
Protection, Faculty of Agriculture, University of Cukurova, 01330 Balcali,
Adana, Turkey. Accepted for publication 22 Aug 2002.
Grapevine (_Vitis vinifera_ L.) is one of the most important crops in
Turkey, with a total area under production of 540 000 hectares producing
[3.4 million] tons of grapes (Anon., 2000). The East Mediterranean region of
Turkey has 19.7 percent of the grapevine growing areas of the country and
the varieties Tarsus Beyazi, Yalova Incisi, Adana Karasi, Hatun Parmagi,
Ergin Cekirdeksiz, Perlette, and Cardinal are the most important.
Viroids are widespread throughout all grapevine-growing areas of the world.
According to sequence analysis, 6 distinct viroids have been recognised on
grapevine (Szychowski et al., 1988). [During a] survey in 1999-2001
[grapevine] viroids in the East Mediterranean region, 184 samples of the
major grapevine varieties were collected from an area of 135 hectares. Vein
banding, yellow vein, leaf rolling, yellowing, spotting, and small leaf
symptoms were detected in all areas surveyed. Samples were tested for the
presence of grapevine viroids by sPAGE [SDS-PAGE?] and RT-PCR. Viroids were
detected by sPAGE essentially as described by Szychowski et al., (1988) and
RT-PCR detection was [as described by] Visvader & Symons (1985).
Using sPAGE analysis, 62 of 184 samples were found to be infected. These
samples were then tested by RT-PCR and 23 were found to be infected with
Grapevine yellow speckle viroid-1 [GYSVd-1], 4 with GYSVd-2, and 11 with Hop
stunt viroid-grapevine [HSVd-g]. Some 7 samples were infected with GYSVd-1
and GYSVd-2, 7 with GYSVd-1 and HSVd-g and 6 with GYSVd-1, GYSVd-2 and
HSVd-g. 4 samples were infected with Citrus exocortis viroid-grapevine
(CEVd-g), GYSVd-1, GYSVd-2 and HSVd-g.
This is the first report of CEVd-g in Turkey, and of GYSVd-1, GYSVd-2 and
HSVd-g in the East Mediterranean region.

[Viroids are unencapsidated, small, circular, ssRNAs containing about 250 to
470 bases, depending on the viroid. There are over 30 known viroids that
infect plants. They replicate autonomously, often without obvious symptoms.
The genomes of 20 viroids have been sequenced. Viroids can cause serious
diseases in potato and fruit crops. They are efficiently transmitted by
vegetative propagation and by contaminated pruning tools. - Mod.DH]
