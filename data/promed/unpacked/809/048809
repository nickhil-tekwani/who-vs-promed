An outbreak of bird flu [avian influenza] on a farm in the eastern German state of Brandenburg has forced authorities to begin slaughtering about 14 000 turkeys, the state government said on Wednesday [3 Feb 2021], reporting the 3rd outbreak there in recent weeks. Type H5N8 bird flu was confirmed in a farm in the Uckermark area, the Brandenburg state government said.

A series of outbreaks of bird flu have been reported in Germany and elsewhere in Europe in past months with wild birds suspected to be spreading the disease.

Sweden planned to cull around 1.3 million chickens after bird flu was found on a farm in the country, Sweden's Board of Agriculture said on 25 Jan 2021.

The risk to humans from the disease is considered low, but past outbreaks among farm birds have resulted in extensive slaughtering programmes to contain the spread.

[The current event in Brandenburg is preceded by 2 earlier HPAI H5N8 outbreaks affecting poultry in this German state, notified to the OIE in reports submitted on 30 Dec 2020 and 25 Jan 2021. The summaries, maps, and links to both are available at https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=37383. The current outbreak in turkeys is yet to be officially reported. This Brandenburg thread started on 27 Dec 2020.

Germany currently suffers HPAI H5N8 outbreaks affecting its poultry in 7 additional states, reported in separate threads to the OIE since November 2020. The largest outbreak has been affecting Lower Saxony. To view all recent outbreaks, in Germany and elsewhere, please refer to OIE's global HPAI map (which covers also other HPAI strains), at http://tinyurl.com/16ad6ssx (click on Germany to recentre, zoom in for the required resolution).

Notably, most of the outbreaks (as well as the cases in wild birds, which are not presented on this map) are concentrated along Europe's northern coastal regions, from UK/France in the west all the way to the northern parts of Poland, reaching Lithuania in the east and including southern Sweden. - Mod.AS
