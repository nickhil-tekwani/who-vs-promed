[The location was not specified, but we assume it may be an extension of
the cases found in the Kedougou area in July 2001 (see refs. above), & is
part of a general breakout of YF in West African countries, as also
referenced above. Senegal completely surrounds the country of Gambia,
where an unvaccinated birdwatcher from Belgium contracted yellow fever in
November 2001 from which she died. All travelers to YF-endemic countries
in Africa & South America should be vaccinated, even if they are only
visiting large cities; several cases of YF have been confirmed in Conakry,
the capital of Guinea, & Abidjan, capital of the Ivory Coast, since June
2001. - Mod.JW
