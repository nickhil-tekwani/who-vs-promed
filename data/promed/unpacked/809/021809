LYME DISEASE - ESTONIA (SAAREMAA)

During the first 5 months of 2007, 106 cases of Lyme disease were
reported in Estonia, of which 40 (38 percent) were in Saaremaa.
An epidemiologist, Kuulo Kutsar, from the Estonian Public Health
Service reports that 482 cases of Lyme disease occurred in Estonia
during 2006. Of these, 154 cases (32 percent) were reported from
Saaremaa, an isolated island off the coast of Estonia. For
comparison, during 2006, 65 cases of Lyme disease were reported from
Tallinn, the Estonian capital, with a population of almost 400 000.
Expert opinion attributes the outbreak in Saaremaa to the
island's isolation and an increasing contact of the island's
population with an unusually large number of ticks.

[Saaremaa is the largest island off the coast of Estonia, with a
population reported to be about 40 000, reachable from the mainland
by ferry and air (<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saaremaa>). The
population for Estonia, as a whole, is reported to be 1.3 million
people. For a map of this area see
<http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/baltic.pdf>.
The annual incidence rate of Lyme disease for Saaremaa. in 2006, was
385 new cases per 100 000 population for Tallinn, or 16.3 per 100 000;
and 30.6 per 100 000 for the rest of Estonia (population 860 000).
For comparison, the annual incidence of Lyme disease in the USA
during 2003-2005, was 29.2 per 100 000 population in 10 reference
states where the disease is endemic (Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland,
Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode
Island, and Wisconsin).
No description of the clinical manifestations is given for the cases
in Saaremaa, that is, erythema migrans or late manifestations
(musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, or neurological), or whether the
number of cases was due to laboratory-based reporting, without
adequate clinical documentation. The report also does not state the
prior annual incidence of Lyme disease in Saaremaa, although it
characterizes the recent numbers as an outbreak -- which it would
appear to be. Neither does the report state any recent enhancement in
case detection or change in reporting methods to account for the
large number of cases in 2006 and early 2007. However, last year
(2006), increased Lyme disease was observed in regions of Russia
adjacent to Estonia, and increased tick activity noted in regions of
Russia, Latvia, and Estonia (see below). - Mod.ML]
