[A] Cases
<http://www.who.int/csr/sars/country/2003_06_19/en/>
A total of 2 new cases and 3 additional deaths were reported worldwide on
the WHO website today, making a total of 8462 cases and 804 deaths. The
full table is available at the link above.
[B] Update 84 - Can SARS be eradicated or eliminated?
<http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_06_19/en/>
The first global conference on SARS, held on Tuesday and Wednesday in Kuala
Lumpur, Malaysia, was convened by WHO to provide technical guidance for the
ongoing and long term response to SARS.
As the number of new cases continues to dwindle, one of the most important
questions for the future is whether SARS can be eliminated or eradicated
from its new human host. Experience with many other infectious diseases,
including smallpox and poliomyelitis, has shown that complete eradication
of an infectious disease is possible only when 3 precise requirements can
be met.
Firstly, an effective intervention capable of interrupting transmission --
ideally, a vaccine -- must be available. Secondly, easy-to-use diagnostic
tools are needed, with sufficient sensitivity and specificity to detect
levels of infection that can lead to transmission of the disease. Finally,
infection of humans must be essential to the life-cycle of the causative
agent -- if the chain of human-to-human transmission is broken, the agent
cannot survive. Existence of an animal reservoir greatly complicates
eradication, but does not preclude it, provided interventions exist to
break the chain of transmission in the animal species as well.
To achieve eradication at the global level, the control intervention must
be safe, simple, and affordable. Current control measures for SARS,
including case detection and isolation, tracing and follow up of contacts,
and quarantine, are effective but extremely time-intensive, costly, and
socially disruptive. Few if any countries can sustain such efforts over time.
As noted during yesterday's conference sessions, an adequate point-of-care
diagnostic test is still not available for SARS and remains a top priority.
Such a test would likewise need to be sufficiently simple and affordable to
be used in countries having a range of different health systems and
resources for health care.
Researchers at the conference also confirmed that far too little is
understood about the origins of the SARS virus and the possible role -- if
any -- that animals play in the transmission cycle. Some studies have
suggested that the earliest cases of SARS, in Guangdong Province, China,
may have had contact, during slaughter or due to proximity to so-called
"wet" markets, with certain wild animal species consumed as delicacies in
southern China. In addition, a SARS-like virus has been detected in a few
of these wild animal species. Additional studies are urgently needed before
any firm conclusions can be reached. Answers to these questions will also
greatly assist predictions of the future evolution of SARS.
For the time being, WHO continues to stress the need to break the chain of
human-to-human transmission through use of currently available control
tools. In many of the most severely affected areas, these measures have
already demonstrated their ability to eliminate SARS in a defined
geographical area.
However, the long term response to SARS, which includes the prevention of
importation or re-importation of cases into SARS-free areas, will clearly
require different strategies for surveillance and response, as current
measures cannot be sustained over time.
Moreover, scientists cannot, on the basis of the very limited data
available, rule out the possibility that SARS will resurface when
environmental conditions or seasons again favour transmission among humans.
Should this occur, countries will need to be ready with alert surveillance
systems and good preparedness strategies.

Update: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome -- United States, June 18, 2003
-----------------------------------------
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) continue to work with
state and local health departments, the World Health Organization (WHO),
and other partners to investigate cases of severe acute respiratory
syndrome (SARS). This report updates reported SARS cases worldwide and in
the United States and summarizes changes in travel recommendations for
provinces in China with the exclusion of Beijing, where a travel advisory
[notice] remains.
From 1 November 2002 to 18 June 2003, a total of 8465 probable SARS cases
were reported to WHO from 29 countries, including 75 from the US; 801
deaths (case fatality rate 9.5 per cent) have been reported, with no
SARS-related deaths reported from the US (1). In the US, a total of 409
SARS cases have been reported from 42 states and Puerto Rico, with 334 (82
per cent) cases classified as suspect SARS and 75 (18 per cent) classified
as probable SARS (more severe illnesses characterized by the presence of
pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome) (2). Serologic testing
for antibody to SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection has been
completed for 136 suspect and 45 probable cases. None of the suspect cases
and 8 (18 per cent) of the probable cases have demonstrated antibodies to
SARS-CoV, all of which have been described previously (3,4). Of the 8
laboratory-confirmed SARS patients in the US, 7 had traveled to areas with
documented or suspected community transmission of SARS within the 10 days
before illness onset. Of these, 4 reported travel to Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region, China; 2 to Toronto, Canada; and one to both
Singapore and Taiwan. The remaining laboratory-confirmed SARS patient is
the spouse of a laboratory-confirmed SARS patient who had traveled to Hong
Kong.
On 17 June, CDC downgraded its travel advisory [notice] for Mainland China
to alert status for all provinces except Beijing, where the travel advisory
remains in effect (5). These changes reflect data reported to WHO by the
Chinese Ministry of Health which indicate that SARS transmission in
Mainland China (other than in Beijing) is limited to a small number of
specific settings through direct person to person spread; no evidence
exists of ongoing community transmission, and monitoring by the Ministry of
Health indicates that no new outbreaks of illness in these provinces.
