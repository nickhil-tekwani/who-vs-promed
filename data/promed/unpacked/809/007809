Alberta Health Services says 122 people across the province have been diagnosed with potentially dangerous _E. coli_ infection over the past month. The health agency says the type of bacterium found in these cases is _E. coli_ O157:H7, which can cause severe illness including cramping, bloody diarrhea, and kidney failure.

Officials say since 15 Jul 2014, there have been 59 confirmed cases in Calgary, 48 cases in Edmonton, 7 cases in the South, 6 cases in the North, and 2 cases in the Central zone [all in Alberta Province]. Alberta Health Services says it hasn't found the source of the _E. coli_, which is usually found in the intestines of humans and animals, or whether the cases are linked.

Earlier in August 2014, some people were admitted to hospital in Edmonton with _E. coli_ that was linked to reports of contaminated bean sprouts.

Since late July 2014, there has been a marked increase in the number of _E. coli_ O157:H7 cases reported in both Calgary and Edmonton as well as a scattering of cases in other parts of Alberta. As of today, there have 78 cases reported, 33 of those in Calgary. 12 patients have been hospitalized, one in Calgary. Date of onset has been between 20 Jul and 7 Aug 2014, but it is likely that more will be identified.

It is currently thought that a locally produced food ingredient in broad distribution to Alberta Asian-style restaurants is the source, as 79 percent of cases have reported eating in an Asian-style restaurant. However, the source of the outbreak has not yet been identified; collaborative work continues on additional data collection/analyses.

[It is not clear if all of these cases are related epidemiologically or genetically. With a link at this point to Asian-style restaurants in the province, it is indeed likely that a widely distributed, non-cooked ingredient in a salad, such as a bean sprout, may be involved.

The _E. coli_ O157 reports from Canada are shown below. Non-O157 isolates are not included as they are not as consistently reported from province to province.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Year / Number of cases reported / Rate per 100 000
2007 / 934 / 2.84
2008 / 661 / 1.99
2009 / 529 / 1.57
2010 / 405 / 1.19
2011 / 481 / 1.40
2012 / 486 / 1.40
2013 / 470 / 1.34

With an estimated population of about 4 million in January 2014, the rate per 100 000 in Alberta for this outbreak alone is 3.05. This number is more than the country-wide numbers for 2012 and 2013 combined. - Mod.LL
