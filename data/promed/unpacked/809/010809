News of the response
Support
-------
- The Ethics Committee approved the use of 4 additional experimental therapeutic molecules, namely ZMapp, Remdesivir, Favipiravir, and Regn3450 - 3471 - 3479. Ebola Treatment Centers (ETC) treatment and care teams will be able to use these molecules for the treatment of patients infected with Ebola virus disease. The protocols for administering these molecules meet strict conditions related in particular to the condition of the patient, the ease of use of the treatment and the capacity of the medical team of the ETC. This Tue 21 Aug 2018, the Remdesivir, produced by Gilead Sciences, was administered to a patient treated at ETC Beni, who is doing well. As a reminder, the mAb114 has started to be used since Sat 11 Aug 2018.

Vaccination
-----------
- Immunization activities continue at the 3 sites of Mabalako, Beni, and Mandima. Since vaccination began on 8 Aug 2018, 1693 people have been vaccinated, including 903 in Mabalako, 471 in Beni and 319 in Mandima.

[Science magazine, excerpted, edited]
http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/08/congo-s-new-ebola-outbreak-hitting-health-care-workers-hard
[Byline: Jon Cohen]

Healthcare [HCWs] workers have been especially hard hit by the current outbreak of Ebola in the northeastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). To date, 9 of the 51 confirmed cases of Ebola have been in people caring for the ill, says Peter Salama, an epidemiologist based in Geneva, Switzerland, who heads the response to the outbreak for the World Health Organization (WHO).

"There's an extremely low level of knowledge and awareness about Ebola in the area," Salama says. "Early on, the healthcare workers took no precautions whatsoever, and unfortunately, we're expecting more confirmed cases from that group."

[CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy), excerpted, edited]
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2018/08/who-13-health-workers-infected-drc-ebola-outbreak
[Byline: Stephanie Soucheray]

Tarik Jasarevic, a spokesperson with the World Health Organization (WHO), told CIDRAP News that 13 healthcare workers have tested positive for Ebola, a troubling development, because infected health workers [HCWs] were one of the main factors in the rapid spread of the disease during the 2013-2016 outbreak in West Africa.

Jasarevic also commented on a recent UNICEF report that said children were being infected at high rates during this outbreak.

"The case distribution is slightly younger than what we might expect when compared to previous outbreaks, but still within the general range; each outbreak is different," he said.

[Note the increase in number of healthcare workers reported here, as indicated by Peter Salama, who noted above that more such cases are to be expected because of the lack of precautions taken early in the outbreak. Since the vaccine is now being administered to HCWs and other front-line workers, it is hoped this increase will slow down significantly very soon as protective antibody post-vaccination becomes effective. - Mod.LK]

[2] Response
- Sun 19 Aug 2018. Ring vaccination. Ebola: 10 rings have been defined around 28 recently confirmed cases
[WHO African Region Twitter message]
https://twitter.com/WHOAFRO

On [8 Aug 2018], @MinSanteRDC, WHO and partners launched the #Ebola ring vaccination for high-risk populations in northeastern #DRC.

As of 19 Aug 2018, 10 rings have been defined around 28 recently confirmed cases and approximately 1300 people have consented and been vaccinated.

[Real progress in the vaccination campaign, tempered by other reports that some contacts are inaccessible because of armed rebel activity. - Mod.LXL]

- Tue 21 Aug 2018: Local government response. North Kivu: Provincial Government informed of level of response to Ebola
[Digital Congo, in French, machine trans., excerpted, edited.]
https://www.digitalcongo.net/article/5b7c1c2e33074a0004d8f85c/

Unsecured funerals and burials of the dead, untimely hospitalization, nosocomial contamination, non-observance of hygiene rules, uncontrolled movement of populations from contaminated areas, and ignorance of the disease by the population are the causes of the spread of Ebola virus disease.

The provincial health minister of North Kivu, Dr Martial Kambumbu Kayenga, explained [Fri 17 Aug 2018] to the government meeting in ministerial council on the level of response against this disease in the territory of Beni. According to the report read by Mrs Marie Shematsi Baeni, spokesperson of the government, the participants were edified on the factors of propagation of the disease.

According to the same source, thanks to the speed with which the Central Government reacted, 6 pillars of response were set up namely surveillance, care, communication, security, psychosocial care, and vaccination.

The installation of the 3 specialized laboratories of the National Institute for Biomedical Research in Goma, Beni, and Mangina and the establishment in Goma of a sentinel treatment center at the North Kivu Provincial Hospital constitute reassuring measures to deal with this officially declared disease in the Mabalako area since the beginning of this month of August [2018].

[The "Six pillars of Ebola control" promulgated by Medecins Sans Frontieres/MSF during the 2014-2015 West African epidemic included Care, Safe burials, Awareness raising, Surveillance, Contact tracing, and Non-Ebola health care. It is interesting to see that the current "6 pillars of response" in North Kivu include the new elements of "Security" and "Vaccination." - Mod.LXL]

- Tue 21 Aug 2018: Safe burial training. Bunia: 24 Red Cross rescuers trained on the burial of Ebola corpses
[Radio Okapi, in French, machine trans., excerpted, edited]
https://www.radiookapi.net/2018/08/21/actualite/societe/bunia-24-secouristes-de-la-croix-rouge-formes-sur-linhumation-des

On 20-21 Aug 2018, 24 Red Cross volunteers from Bunia and Mambasa (Ituri) were trained on the burial of the bodies of those who died of the Ebola virus disease.

This training was provided by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). For 2 days, these rescuers learned how to add chlorine to water before disinfecting places where sick people would have stayed.

The 24 rescuers were also briefed on the importance of securing individual equipment such as masks, boots, rubber overalls, or gloves. They learned how to secure the body bags to avoid getting infected or contaminating other members of the community.

A risky job, is how Hubert Dedegbeu, in charge of the program at ICRC, characterizes it. "When there is a body [to be buried], the clothing worn by the person who died of Ebola must be disinfected. There is a huge risk of contamination. There is a step-by-step protocol to explain to volunteers," [he] said.

[Safe burials are still a mainstay of Ebola outbreak control. Thus far we seem to have heard less about local cultural and religious norms in the eastern DRC -- and how they impact the implementation of safe burial procedures -- compared to West Africa. - Mod.LXL]

- Fri. 17 Aug 2018. Mangina: WHO Africa, reference health centre. Non-Ebola health care
[WHO Africa, excerpted, edited]
https://www.afro.who.int/news/ebola-hope-end-tunnel-mangina-east-drc

To ensure that everyone has access to care during this period of the epidemic, the Ministry of Health decided to provide free care to all patients attending health centres in the region.

These positive advances are welcomed by other health officials in the region. "This will help us to provide not only the free patient care, but also with rapid detection of cases in our health facilities," notes Musubao Tongo, a treating nurse who came from the nearby health zone of Oicha with about 50 other colleagues to help out at the Mangina health centre.

Built in 1976 and managed by the Diocese of Butembo, a neighbouring town of Beni, Mangina's reference health centre is among the largest in the area, with an installed capacity of 119 beds. According to the figures of this health unit, each month, around 250-300 patients are admitted and between 700 and 800 outpatients are taken care of.

[The mention here of the very sizeable regular patient load of the Mangina hospital is a reminder that people continue to take ill and die of causes other than Ebola during an outbreak, and in greater numbers. As huge as the West African Ebola epidemic was, it is generally acknowledged that more people died because of healthcare system disruptions caused by the epidemic, than died of Ebola itself. Amongst the common endemic infectious diseases, one would expect that fatalities from malaria and typhoid fever in the setting of an ongoing Ebola outbreak would not rise, because these 2 diseases are screened for and/or empirically treated (artesunate compounds and ceftriaxone) in febrile suspect cases. However, if an outbreak develops into a prolonged epidemic that disrupts the entire healthcare system, as we saw in West Africa, then mortality from tuberculosis and AIDS increases, because those patients are dependent on long-term multi-drug prophylactic and treatment regimens through supervised outpatient programs. Thus, non-Ebola health care should remain a pillar of Ebola outbreak control. - Mod.LXL]

- Sat 18 Aug 2018. Mapping. Ebola: researchers plot maps, collect data to fight future infectious disease outbreaks
[VOA (Voice of America), excerpted, edited]
https://www.voanews.com/a/ebola-prevention/4534422.html
[Byline: Salem Solomon]

Researchers in the DRC are collecting data that will improve how we respond to, and prevent, future outbreaks of Ebola and other infectious diseases. Their work involves building a comprehensive picture of how diseases like Ebola spread by tracking cases and mapping where people live, work and seek health care. Over time, a more sophisticated understanding of the environments through which contagious diseases spread will lead to faster, more effective treatment.

[...]

[Anne] Rimoin's [Associate professor of epidemiology at the UCLA School of Public Health and director of the UCLA-DRC Health Research and Training Program, an effort based in Kinshasa, Congo] group partners with several organizations, including the DRC's Ministry of Health, the World Health Organization, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, part of the US Department of Health and Human Services.

Rimoin said the Health Research and Training Program in Kinshasa uses a mix of high-tech solutions and local knowledge. The group analyzes satellite imagery to understand the terrain and population centers in the DRC. But they also rely on insights from residents to compile a more accurate and complete data set.

These data-collection tools allow Rimoin's team to figure out not just boundaries but human activities, including traffic flows and health centers.

Working with local populations is critical to the project's success. It's these experts who know the terrain and the population, and that expertise often proves invaluable ...[more]

[3] Reflections
- Tue 21 Aug 2018. From 1976 to 2018: reflections on early investigations into the Ebola virus
[Transactions of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine & Hygiene, edited]
https://doi.org/10.1093/trstmh/try088

ref: Piot P, Spencer J. From 1976 to 2018: reflections on early investigations into the Ebola virus. Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg. 2018; try088
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
In the late 1970s, early investigations into the Ebola virus informed the world's understanding of what was then an unknown disease. One such study, published by Bowen and colleagues in 1978, laid the foundations for future research into its prevention and treatment. However, nearly 4 decades later, scientific progress had not translated into action on the ground with no approved drugs, no vaccines, and no diagnostic tests available when the 2014-15 outbreak began in West Africa. Encouragingly, it appears that we have learned important lessons from the 2014-2015 outbreak, with a swift and rigorous response to the most recent outbreaks in Equateur province, Democratic Republic of Congo, including the deployment of a vaccine. Ebola will certainly remain a challenge in the years to come and we as the global health community must ensure that innovative research translates into policy and action on the ground, with the full participation of affected communities.
