Michigan - Officials said on Wednesday that two more cattle herds in
northeast Lower Michigan are infected with bovine tuberculosis,
threatening the state's classification as free from bovine TB. Loss of
the TB-free designation could lead to a requirement that cattle be
tested for the chronic lung disease before shipping out of Michigan,
chilling the market for Michigan meat. Michigan officials said that it
will be two or three months before the federal government will act.
State Agriculture Director Dan Wyant was quoted as saying, "These
findings do not represent a food safety concern. It is a concern of the
marketability. While we are disappointed with these results, we remain
focused on our objective of eliminating bovine tuberculosis from both
livestock and wildlife in Michigan. We're continuing with our plan to
test cattle, goats and captive deer and elk in the five-county area of
northeast Michigan affected by TB."

Subject: TB testing
[There was question that came in from one our readers inquiring about
the type of testing used on dead animals. I forwarded his question to
Dr. Waldrup who has had tremendous experience with this topic. Ken,
Thanks for your reply - Mod.TG
Testing of dead animals merely involves looking for gross lesions in
lymph nodes, histopathology and acid-fast stains of tissues and culture,
though culture can take up to 8 weeks. ELISA is a serologic test and
requires serum. We are doing similar "testing" of hunter-killed
whitetails in Texas right now. Some folks have tried using PCR on
tissues -- works sometimes, sometimes not. The standard procedure would
be to remove and visually examine the lymph nodes from the head (medial
retropharygeals, lateral retropharyngeals and parietals), thorax
(pulmonary and mediastinals) and abdomen (hepatics, abomasal,
mesenterics and ileocecal) plus whatever peripheral nodes you could get
(popliteal, mammary, prescapular). Section each node and look for an
obvious lesion. If a lesion is noted or for survey purposes, freeze
half the node and put the other half in formalin. Culture the frozen
tissue (_M. bovis_ survives freezing very well) and cut and stain the
fixed tissue. If one sees acid-fast bacteria in the tissue, the sample
is classified as "lesion compatible" and culture would have to sort out
whether it was _M. bovis, M. avium_ or one of at least a dozen other
saprophytic mycobacteria found in North America.
