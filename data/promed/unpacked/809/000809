Anthrax virus (bacteria) is spreading over the northern regions of Tajikistan. On [16 Jul 2013], 2 more infected people were registered in Bobojonghafur district [Ghafurov district] of Tajik Sogdiysk region [Sogd province], Asia-Plus reported with the reference to deputy chief physician of the regional Sanitary-Epidemiological Service, Nasibdzhon Ikromov.

According to Ikromov, the Center for Sanitary and Epidemiological Supervision takes measures to prevent the spread of the infectious diseases in accordance with the approved action plan. [However, anthrax is not contagious, though infectious. - Mod.MHJ]

Meanwhile, 8 anthrax cases were detected within the country, including 4 in Aini district [previously only 2], 2 in Panjakent district [previous report had 4] and 2 more in Bobojonghafur [Ghafurov] district, he said. One of the people infected with anthrax has died in the infectious disease hospital.

According to Ikromov, 33 people in the Ayni district, as well as 28 people in Panjakent and 6 in Bobojonghafur [Ghafurov] districts had contact with the source of infection (the infected animal). All these people are under medical observation.

[Ghafurov district is 165 km (about 103 miles) northeast of Ayni district on the M34 highway, and is also known as Bobojon Ghafurov; see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobojon_Ghafurov. This additional separation must put in doubt that the present 8 individuals were infected from the one infected animal -- and it is some 90 km (about 56 miles) between Ayni and Panjakent districts. Meat is usually locally consumed in Central Asia, and with such a distribution we can surely expect more cases.
