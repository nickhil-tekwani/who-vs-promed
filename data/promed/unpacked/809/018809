Bluetongue in Belgium: follow-up report No.5
--------------------------------------------
Translation of information received on (and up to) 6 Oct 2006 from Dr Luc
Engel, chief veterinary officer, Federal State Service for Public Health,
Food Chain Safety and Environment, Animal and Plant Health Policy
Department, Brussels:
End of previous report period: 22 Sep 2006 (Disease Information 2006;
19[39]: 683, 28 Sep)
Identification of agent: bluetongue virus serotype 8.
Date of start of the event: 18 Aug 2006.
Nature of diagnosis: clinical and laboratory.
New outbreaks: there were 55 new outbreaks reported in Antwerpen (2),
Brabant Wallon (2), Hainaut, Liege (5), Limburg (12), Luxembourg, Namur
(3), Oost-Vlaanderen (23), Vlaams Brabant (4) and West-Vlaanderen (2)
between 12 Sep and 29 Sep 2006. There were 14 farms with cattle, and the
rest were sheep farms. There were 1474 susceptible animals on farms,
resulting in 67 with 18 deaths. By species, there were 931 susceptible
sheep, 47 cases and 17 deaths, while there were 543 susceptible cattle, 20
cases resulting in one death <http://www.oie.int/cartes/19_41_BEL.png>.

[The disease continues to spread and may have even accelerated. Between 12
and 21 Sep 2006, there were 10 outbreaks in 4 districts; between 18 Aug and
14 Sep 2006, 26 farms in 5 districts were affected; the initial OIE report
indicated 11 farms with clinical cases in Liege and Limberg districts. So,
the 55 new outbreaks in 10 districts reported here are cause for some
concern. The disease will likely continue spreading to some extent until
the 1st frost, when the _Culicoides_ vector will no longer be a problem.
From the current report, 20 cattle of 543 susceptible became sick
(morbidity is 3.7 per cent) and one of the 20 sick cattle died, for a case
fatality rate of 5.0 per cent. For sheep, 47 of 931 sheep became sick
(morbidity is 5.0 per cent), while 17 out of the 47 sick sheep died, for a
case fatality rate of 36 per cent. It would be interesting to know whether
this kind of differential mortality has occurred throughout the course of
the outbreak. - Mod.PC]
