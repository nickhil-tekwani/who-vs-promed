An Indonesian woman has died and another was in critical condition at
a specialist Jakarta hospital after local tests showed both had the
H5N1 bird flu virus, a senior Health Ministry official said on Friday
[10 Feb 2006].
Blood samples from the 2 women, both from a suburb east of Jakarta,
have been sent to a Hong Kong laboratory recognised by the World
Health Organisation for confirmatory tests.
Hariadi Wibisono, director of control of animal-borne diseases at the
ministry, announced the local test results on Thursday [9 Feb] but
said one of the women had since died. "I received a report this
morning that she died last night," Wibisono told Reuters. A spokesman
of the Sulianti Saroso hospital -- which has been specially
designated to treat bird flu -- said the other woman was in critical condition.
The 2 women are not related, but hail from the same suburban Jakarta
area of Bekasi. Indonesia has had 16 WHO-confirmed deaths from bird
flu and 7 confirmed cases in which patients have survived.

An Indonesian woman who local tests several days ago showed had the
H5N1 bird flu virus has died at a specialist Jakarta hospital, a
senior Health Ministry official said on Saturday [11 Feb 2006]. The
death of the 27-year-old woman came a day after another woman who was
also declared after local tests as a positive bird flu case died in
the same hospital [see part (1) above). Blood samples from the 2
women, who both lived near Jakarta, have been sent to a Hong Kong
laboratory recognized by the World Health Organization (WHO) for
confirmation. Indonesia has had 16 WHO-confirmed deaths from bird
flu and 7 confirmed cases in which patients have survived.
Hariadi Wibisono, director of control of animal-borne diseases at the
ministry, said the latest woman to die had been in critical condition
since she was admitted last week at Sulianti Saroso hospital, the
designated bird flu treatment center in Jakarta. "Her condition
improved and worsened in the hospital until she died last night. A
few days ago, local tests showed she was a positive case but we are
still waiting for confirmation," he told Reuters.
The 2 women are not related, but both come from the suburb area of
Bekasi, just east of the Indonesian capital.
[If confirmed, these 2 cases bring the total number of human cases in
Indonesia to 25, 18 of whom have now died (72 percent). - Mod.CP]

Health authorities in northern China have placed 35 people under
observation after 15 000 fowl died of avian influenza on the farm
where they were working, state media said today. The Xinhua news
agency, citing government sources in Shanxi province, said the 35
workers had been confined to their homes in Yangquan city and were
receiving twice-daily medical check-ups.
Authorities have confirmed that the H5N1 strain of bird flu killed 15
000 poultry on their farm and said 187 745 more had been culled in
the affected area to prevent the disease spreading.
Yesterday, the health ministry announced China's 11th human case of
bird flu. The 26-year-old woman from the eastern province of Fujian,
tested positive for H5N1 after being hospitalised with fever and
pneumonia on 10 Jan2006, but was in a stable condition, it said.
Bird flu has killed seven people in China. The Fujian Daily reported
today that the 26-year-old woman was out of quarantine and expected
to leave hospital soon.
Like most of the other human cases in China, no outbreak among
animals was detected in Zhangpu county where the woman lived,
emphasising the inability of authorities to effectively monitor the
disease. The Fujian provincial agricultural department has collected
319 poultry samples within a 3-kilometre radius of woman's home, but
all have tested negative, the Fujian Daily said.
Julie Hall, a Beijing-based World Health Organisation (WHO) expert,
said that although the WHO was still awaiting information about what
caused the latest human infection, the case appeared to have followed
a familiar pattern. "What we've seen in quite a number of other cases
in China is that the Ministry of Agriculture has not been able to
identify viruses in the animals in that area," Ms Hall said. "But
there certainly have been reports from the health authorities and
patients themselves that animals in their areas have been dying and
have been sick for some weeks prior to their onset of their illness."

Ms Hall said she was not surprised by the latest case. "We believe
the virus is endemic in parts of China and certainly endemic in wild
birds. Many poultry flocks in China remain vulnerable to infections."
China has reported 34 H5N1 outbreaks among poultry since the
beginning of 2005, with most appearing since October. "We would
anticipate that there would be a continued number of these types of
cases, unfortunately, throughout the winter," Ms Hall said.

[One of the significant aspects of the outbreaks of H5N1 avian
influenza in Eurasia has been the relative absence of disease among
those in contact with poultry occupationally, either in poultry
farming or culling operations. It will be surprising, therefore, if
any of these 35 individuals succumb to avian influenza. - Mod.CP]

The World Health Organisation (WHO) said on Friday [10 Feb 2006] that
it was sending a team of 7 or 8 experts to Nigeria to try to prevent
human cases of bird flu after outbreaks in poultry. "We have a team
arranged to go tomorrow (Saturday) or Sunday," Michael Perdue, an
epidemiologist at WHO's global influenza programme, told a news briefing.
There was no evidence of human cases in Nigeria, Africa's most
populous nation, where there have been mass deaths of chickens in the
northern state of Kaduna, he said. "We're concerned with the fact
that this particular strain of H5N1 now has moved through Asia,
Central Asia, Kazakhstan, Russia, Mongolia, Romania, Ukraine, Turkey,
Iraq and now down into Africa," Perdue added.
Bruce Aylward, coordinator of WHO's polio initiative, said that
Nigerian and international health officials would use a weekend polio
immunisation campaign to shore up defences against bird flu. "The
critical thing at this point in the avian flu epidemic is to prevent
human exposure to the virus, to prevent human cases, if they've not
already occurred," Aylward said.

Nigeria scrambled on Saturday [11 Feb 2006] to discover whether
people who had fallen ill close to where the deadly H5N1 bird flu
virus was found had caught the disease, and farmers culled thousands
more sick chickens.
No human case of bird flu has been confirmed in Africa's most
populous country, where H5N1 has killed tens of thousands of poultry,
but it is hard for authorities to monitor because of logistical
problems and the high mortality from other diseases.
"There are a few suspected cases. We're trying to locate them but our
sources can't provide us with addresses for now," said Abdulsalam
Nasidi, who is in charge of the response to bird flu as a threat to
humans at the federal Health Ministry.
He said epidemiologists were searching for 2 people feared to have
contracted bird flu in the northern state of Kaduna, close to Sambawa
Farms where one of the poultry samples was found that tested positive
for H5N1. "I'm on my way to Kaduna now to go and intensify the
search," Nasidi told Reuters by telephone.
He said the ministry had heard rumours of a suspected human case of
bird flu in the south of the country but had no further details and
was trying to check the reports. If confirmed, this would be a major
development, as bird flu in poultry has so far only been found in the
northern states of Kaduna and Kano and the central state of Plateau.
Samples have already been taken from people who are ill in the areas
affected by bird flu. Should tests in Nigerian laboratories indicate
the presence of bird flu, the samples would be sent abroad for
further testing, Nasidi said.
The outbreak of H5N1 in Nigeria is the 1st known appearance of the
virus in Africa. The strain has been confirmed on 4 farms, and other
farmers and villagers are reporting mass deaths of poultry. At Phed
Farm near the village of Danbare in Kano state -- close to Sovet Farm
where one of the H5N1 samples came from -- farm workers in shorts and
sandals were killing chickens with knives and using their bare hands
to toss them into fires. They said the farm had lost thousands of
chickens in the past few days and they were culling the rest of the
flock. Their hands and clothing were spattered with chicken blood and
the only protective equipment they had were surgical face masks.
Information about bird flu and protection against it has been slow to
filter out to the impoverished areas where chickens are dying. Trade
in live fowl is unabated in the region and people are moving chickens
around by public transport as usual. At the market in Kano, the state
capital and Nigeria's 2nd-largest city, people were carrying poultry
in baskets on their heads and tied to the handlebars of motorcycles.
As in most of sub-Saharan Africa, poultry are everywhere in Nigeria
-- in villagers' backyards, in city streets, by the side of the road,
in crowded markets, on buses. Most poultry is bought live and
slaughtered at home. The government has ordered suspect birds culled
and suspect farms quarantined, but in the field there has so far been
little sign of a concrete response by the authorities.

A Comment on Demographic Data
-----------------------------
We have recently analysed demographic data available from the "WHO
situation updates on avian influenza"
(<http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/updates/en/index.html>).
Age was reported for 116 human H5N1 influenza cases. According to
these data, 50 percent of cases occurred in individuals 16 years or
younger, 75 percent of cases were 29 years or younger, and 90 percent
of cases were 39 years or younger (see
<http://influenzareport.com/ir/figures/ad060210.htm>).
The reasons for the concentration of cases in children and young
adults are unclear.
We have compiled the data in a Microsoft Access file which is
available from <http://influenzareport.com/download_mdb.htm>

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr. Kamps for making these data and the analysis
available to ProMED-mail participants. - Mod.CP]
[Playing with the data a bit (as this epidemiologist couldn't
resist), if one stratifies by country of origin, the mean ages of
cases is somewhat lower in Turkey:
For 116 cases on whom the information is available, the ages range
from 1-69 years of age, with a mean age of 19.8 years (SD 14.6)
By country of origin:
Cambodia - 4 cases; ages range from 8 to 28 years, with a mean age of
20.3 (SD 8.8)
China - 11 cases; ages range from 6 to 41 years, with a mean age of
25.5 (SD 12.0)
Indonesia - 21 cases; ages range from 4 to 39 years, with a mean age
of 19.3 (SD 11.7)
Iraq - 1 case age 15
Thailand - 21 cases; ages range from 2 to 58 years, with a mean age
of 21.4 (SD 18.1)
Turkey - 16 cases; ages range from 2 to 65 years, with a mean age of
13.0 (SD 16.2)
Vietnam - 42 cases; ages range from 1 to 69 years, with a mean age
of 20.4 (SD 14.2)
Many questions arise (and remain) as to why the age distribution of
cases is skewed to younger age groups, including exposure risk,
disease reporting bias, and intrinsic host issues. - Mod.MPP]
