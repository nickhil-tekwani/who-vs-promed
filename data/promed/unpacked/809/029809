Agriculture minister Costas Kades said officials will visit Paphos region to evaluate the damage caused to grapes infected by downy mildew, following complaints filed by farmers. Following the evaluation, compensation to be paid to farmers would take into account their attempts to limit the damage caused by the downy mildew.

Wine producers say his [2018] season's grapes have been affected by the disease due to high levels of humidity. The main variety of grape affected by downy mildew is Xynisteri, a local white grape variety. Other varieties grown in Cyprus are less vulnerable. [A local] winery said that even grapes that weren't affected would never mature properly and could not be made into wine.

[Downy mildew on grapevine is caused by the fungus-like organism (oomycete) _Plasmopara viticola_. It causes lesions on leaves which later become covered with white downy growth and turn necrotic. It can also affect flowers and fruits. Disease development is favoured by temperatures of 15 to 20 deg C (approx. 59 to 68 deg F) and moist conditions. In years with warm, extended wet periods during bloom, fruit clusters may be partially or totally destroyed. The disease can cause severe crop losses. All commercial grape cultivars are susceptible, and the disease occurs irregularly in most grape growing regions worldwide.

Spores are spread within a crop mainly by splashing rain, wind or mechanical means. The pathogen survives between crops on infected plant debris as oospores, which are formed inside the host tissues. It is an obligate parasite and cannot be cultured _in vitro_. Disease management relies mainly on preventative fungicide applications according to forecasting services. Systemic fungicides are also available.
