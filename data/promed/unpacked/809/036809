Viet Nam: 2nd Human Case of Avian Influenza in Thanh Hoa Province
---------------------------------------------------
Viet Nam has detected the 2nd case of a human infected with avian influenza
virus in a week as it struggles to combat the virus, officials said.
A 58-year-old man from northern Thanh Hoa province, some 160 kilometres
south of Hanoi, tested positive for the H5N1 virus, said Nguyen Dang Ngoan,
director of the provincial Preventive Medicine Centre. Ngoan said there
were dead chickens reported in the man's neighbourhood a month ago and his
family also slaughtered chickens for meals. The man had avian
influenza-like symptoms of high fever, coughing and breathing difficulties
on 20 Apr 2005 and tested positive for the virus on Sun 15 May 2005, Ngoan
said.
Last week, a 52-year-old man from northern Vinh Phuc province also tested
positive for avian influenza infection. Both men remained in stable
condition on Tuesday at Bach Mai Hospital in Hanoi, said a hospital doctor
who identified herself only as Dung. [The 52-year-old patient was wrongly
reported to have died of H5N1 virus infection in ProMED-mail post "Avian
influenza, human - East Asia (75): Viet Nam & Cambodia 20050516.1345"].
Meanwhile, initial tests on a 20-year-old Cambodian woman suspected of
contracting bird flu showed that she did not have the virus, said Phan Van
Tu, chief virologist at the Pasteur Institute in Ho Chi Minh City. The
woman from Kampot province was admitted to a hospital in southern Viet Nam
last week after showing avian influenza-like symptoms.
Avian influenza virus, which has ravaged poultry farms across Asia since
late 2003, has been responsible for the deaths 36 people in Viet Nam, 12 in
Thailand and 4 in Cambodia.

[It was reported erroneously in Mod.CP's comment in the ProMED-mail post
entitled "Avian influenza, human - East Asia (75): Viet Nam & Cambodia
20050516.1345" that the 1st human case of avian influenza in Viet Nam in 4
weeks (the 52-year-old man) had died. I am indebted to David Price
