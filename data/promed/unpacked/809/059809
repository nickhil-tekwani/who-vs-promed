COVID's long shadow: symptoms may last 2 to 18 months
-----------------------------------------------------
A pair of studies published today [12 Aug 2022] detail long COVID, with US researchers finding that more than 1 in 4 pediatric patients hospitalized for COVID-19 or multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) had persistent symptoms or impaired activity 2-4 months later, and a Norwegian study revealing that nearly half of patients with mild COVID-19 still had symptoms after 1 year.

MIS-C is a rare but serious post-infectious complication of COVID-19.

Fatigue, weakness most common in kids
-------------------------------------
In the first study, published in Pediatrics, a team led by University of Colorado and Boston Children's Hospital researchers surveyed family caregivers of 119 pediatric COVID-19 survivors and 160 MIS-C patients younger than 21 years at 2-4 months after admission to 25 US pediatric hospitals from May 2020 to May 2021. [Aline B. Maddux, Laura Berbert, Cameron C. Young, et al. Health Impairments in Children and Adolescents After Hospitalization for Acute COVID-19 or MIS-C . Pediatrics e2022057798. https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2022-057798]

The study took place before the delta variant surge and the availability of COVID-19 vaccines for this age-group.

Roughly half of the COVID-19 patients were boys, 66.4% had underlying medical conditions, and 32.8% were obese. MIS-C patients were most often 5 years or older, 58.1% were boys, 69.4% were previously healthy, 11.9% had a previously diagnosed respiratory condition (89% of cases were asthma), and 31.2% were obese.

Most participants were admitted to an intensive care unit. Thirteen children and teens diagnosed as having COVID-19 (11%) and 12 MIS-C patients (8%) were readmitted to the hospital. Thirty-two COVID-19 survivors (26.9%) reported lingering symptoms (22.7%) or impaired activity (14.3%) at 2 to 4 months, and 48 MIS-C patients (30.0%) reported persistent symptoms (20.0%) or impaired activity (21.3%).

Among COVID-19 patients, symptoms and impaired activity at 2-4 months were linked to more organ system involvement -- most often respiratory, hematologic, and/or gastrointestinal (adjusted rate ratio [aRR] for symptoms, 1.29; aRR for impaired activity, 1.37).

MIS-C patients with previously diagnosed respiratory conditions more often reported lingering symptoms (aRR, 3.09), while those with obesity more commonly reported impaired activity (aRR, 2.52). As much as 9% of COVID-19 patients and 1% of MIS-C patients received new diagnoses after their infections.

The most common persistent symptoms in both groups included fatigue or weakness (11.3% of COVID-19 survivors, 20% of MIS-C patients), shortness of breath (9.2% and 2.5%, respectively), cough (9.2% and 2.5%), headache (8.4% and 7.5%), muscle and body aches (5% and 3.1%), and fever (2.5% and 0.6%).

The most common types of activity impairments were inability to walk or exercise as much as before (6.7% of the COVID-19 group, 14.4% of the MIS-C group), sleeping much more than before (6.7% and 7.5%), and difficulty focusing and completing schoolwork (4.2% and 3.8%).

The researchers said that while it is reassuring that most participants fully recovered within 2 months, "these findings highlight the importance of postdischarge follow-up of these severely ill patients. Additional interventions (e.g., occupational or physical therapy) and clinical follow up of these high-risk cohorts may mitigate long-term sequelae."

Senior author Adrienne Randolph, MD, of Boston Children's Hospital, said in a hospital news release that although the study showed that severely ill children generally fare better than hospitalized older adults, the findings are still very worrisome. "The risks of severe illness and lingering complications are higher than the risk of complications from the vaccine, which are very rare," she noted. [https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/961201]

Randolph said she strongly recommends that children and teens get vaccinated against COVID-19. "We know that patients can be re-infected even if they've had COVID-19, and we previously showed that vaccination can prevent MIS-C and severe COVID-19," she said.

Impaired memory more common over time in adults
-----------------------------------------------
In a study in Clinical Infectious Diseases, a team led by University of Bergen researchers in Norway followed 233 mildly ill COVID-19 patients for 12 months (all 233 patients) or 18 months (149 of them) and 189 uninfected age-matched controls from 28 Feb to 4 Apr 2020. The researchers collected clinical data 6, 12, and 18 months after infection and blood samples at 2, 4, 6, and 12 months. [Elisabeth B Fjelltveit, Bj√∏rn Blomberg, Kanika Kuwelker et al. Symptom burden and immune dynamics 6 to 18 months following mild SARS-CoV-2 infection - a case-control study, Clinical Infectious Diseases, 2022; https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciac655]

Median COVID-19 patient age was 44 years (41 in controls), and 16 patients and 7 controls were 18 years or younger. More patients than controls reported underlying illnesses (53% vs 42%), most commonly chronic lung disease (12% vs 8%), high blood pressure (11% vs 7%), rheumatic disease (7% vs 3%), or chronic heart disease (6% vs 6%).

A total of 46% of the 233 COVID-19 patients reported lingering symptoms at 12 months. Relative to controls, infected adults were at high risk for fatigue (excess risk, 27%; aOR, 5.86), memory issues (21%; aOR, 7.42), problems concentrating (20%; aOR, 8.88), and shortness of breath (10%; aOR, 2.66).

Children aged 0-15 years (patients and controls) reported no symptoms at 12 months. Patients aged 16-30 years, 31-45, and 46-60 were at highest risk for impaired memory and concentration, and those aged 46-60 and 61-81 were more likely than controls to report fatigue.

The prevalence of impaired memory rose overall from 6 to 18 months (excess risk, 11.5%) and among women (18.7%) but not men (9.6%). At 12 and 18 months, women were at excess risk of having symptoms overall (20.2% and 17.5%, respectively) but not 6 months (6.8%).

SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-specific immune responses were significantly linked with shortness of breath and the number of symptoms at 12 months.

Although reassuring in that most persistent symptoms were moderate rather than severe, the findings raise concern about the lack of improvement in memory over time, the researchers said. "Although sometimes perceived as vague symptoms, not always being recognized by the health care systems, cognitive symptoms may have a significant impact on daily activity and work performance," they wrote.

[B] Long COVID patients: immune system
Date: Thu 11 Aug 2022
Source: Medscape [edited]
https://wb.md/3AjJ9At


Using immune profiling, a small but intense study found that people with long COVID have increased antibody responses to other non-COVID viruses, like Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV), as well as significantly lowered cortisol levels compared with people without long COVID.

The study -- which is still a preprint -- looked at 215 people from Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City and Yale New Haven Hospital in Connecticut.

The 215 study participants were placed into 4 groups:
- healthy individuals who haven't been previously infected with COVID-19
- healthy, unvaccinated people who have had COVID-19
- healthy, vaccinated people who have had COVID-19 with no lingering symptoms
- individuals who have had persistent symptoms following acute COVID-19 infection

According to Yale immunology professor Akiko Iwasaki, PhD, and co-authors, an unexpected development in the group's research revealed that subsets of long COVID patients had antibody reactivity against non-COVID-19 viruses, particularly Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV), a member of the herpes virus family.

The presence of EBV has been previously reported during severe COVID-19 infection in hospitalized patients. But the elevated immune responses to EBV found among patients in this study indicate a recent reactivation of this particular virus may be a common feature of long COVID.

The profiling conducted in the study found that the reactivation of EBV is not just incidental following a COVID-19 infection. In fact, the researchers write that these kinds of non-COVID viral pathogens "may alternatively mediate, aggravate, or exploit the persistent changes" in people with long COVID.

It's unclear, however, whether EBV reactivation may predispose those with long COVID to the development or worsening of autoimmune diseases, which has been reported among people with multiple sclerosis.

Additionally, one of the most striking findings was that participants with long COVID had significant decreases in levels of cortisol, the body's main stress hormone.

"Prior reports have associated low cortisol levels during the early phase of COVID-19 in patients that develop respiratory long COVID symptoms," Iwasaki and colleagues write in the study. "Thus, our current finding of persistently decreased cortisol production in participants with long COVID more than a year following acute infection warrants expanded investigation."

The authors note several important limitations to this study, primarily its small participant pool of 215 persons. While the individuals who participated were extensively immune profiled, the limited number hinders the study's ability to be broadly applicable to the general population.

"Discussion
Persistent sequelae are a prominent and debilitating consequence of infection with SARS-CoV-2 (1,3,29). Our exploratory analyses identified key significant immunological differences relative to demographically matched control populations at > 400 days post infection. A number of significant changes in circulating leukocytes, including increases in non-classical monocytes, activated B cells, double-negative B cells, exhausted T cells, and IL-4/IL-6 secreting CD4 T cells, and decreases in conventional DC1 and central memory CD4 T cells were identified. In addition, antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 antigens and herpesvirus lytic antigens were elevated in participants with long COVID. In contrast, no significant differences were found for autoantibodies to human exoproteome. Most strikingly among participants with long COVID, levels of plasma cortisol were roughly half of those found in healthy or convalescent controls. Based on machine learning, cortisol levels alone were the most significant predictor for long COVID classification, as well as for estimation of Long COVID Propensity Score. Multiple hypotheses have been proposed for long COVID pathogenesis, including persistent virus/virus remnants, autoimmunity, dysbiosis, latent viral reactivation and unrepaired tissue damage (18,32-38). Our data suggest the involvement of persistent antigen, reactivation of latent herpesviruses, and chronic inflammation, and are less consistent with the autoantibodies to extracellular antigens. ...

In summary, significant biological differences have been identified between participants with long COVID and demographically and medically matched convalescent and healthy control groups, validating the extensive reports of persistent symptoms by various long COVID advocacy groups. Unbiased machine learning models further identified both putative biomarkers of long COVID, as well as potential mediators of long COVID disease pathogenesis. Our study provides a basis for future investigations into the immunological underpinnings driving the genesis of long COVID." - Mod.LK]

[2] Omicron variant
[A] Children: symptoms
Date: Fri 12 Aug 2022
Source: Japanese Times [edited]
https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2022/08/12/national/children-symptoms-omicron/


More children developed symptoms such as fever and convulsions in Japan when the omicron variant of the coronavirus raged early this year [2022] than when the delta variant was dominant, a Japanese study showed Friday [12 Aug 2022].

This research is the first large-scale survey in Japan to compare symptoms of COVID-19 patients aged under 18 before after the outbreak of the first omicron variant in Japan, according to the National Center for Child Health and Development. The survey, led by the National Center for Child Health and Development, is based on data on hospitalized COVID-19 patients across the country.

It compared the symptoms of 458 infected children registered between August and December last year [2021], when the delta variant was dominant, and those of 389 children registered between January and March this year [2022] during the country's 6th wave of COVID-19, driven by omicron.

The proportion of surveyed cases who had a fever of 38 deg.C [approx. 100 deg.F] or higher was some 40% among 2- to 12-year-olds during the omicron period, about twice the rate during the delta period.

The share of children who had convulsions also grew in the same age group. That of children who developed a sore throat increased sharply among those age 13 and over. By contrast, the proportion of children who experienced smell and taste disorders fell among those age 6 and over.

Of the 790 children whose COVID-19 vaccination records were available, none of the 43 who needed supplementary oxygen or other treatments for severely ill patients had received 2 COVID-19 vaccine shots, according to the survey.

The survey suggests that COVID-19 vaccinations are effective in preventing severe symptoms, according to the center.

"We have not been able to examine the impact of the currently dominant BA.5 omicron subvariant, but the increase in fever and convulsions is considered to be important information for the COVID-19 diagnosis of children," the institution said.

Abstract
--------
Introduction: Information regarding the clinical manifestations and outcomes of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in children under the omicron variant predominant period is still limited.

Methods: A nationwide retrospective cohort study was conducted. Pediatric COVID-19 patients (< 18 years of age) hospitalized between 1 Aug 2021 and 31 Mar 2022 were enrolled. Epidemiological and clinical characteristics between the delta variant predominant period [1 Aug to 31 Dec 2021] and the omicron variant predominant period [1 Jan to 31 Mar 2022] were compared.

Results: During the study period, 458 cases in the delta predominant period and 389 cases in the omicron predominant period were identified. Median age was younger (6.0 vs. 8.0 years, P = 0.004) and underlying diseases were more common (n = 65, 16.7% vs. n = 53, 11.6%) in the omicron predominant period than those in the delta variant predominant era. For clinical manifestations, fever ‚â• 38 deg.C [approx. 100 deg.F] at 2 to < 13 years old, sore throat at ‚â• 13 years, and seizures at 2 to < 13 years old were more commonly observed, and dysgeusia and olfactory dysfunction at ‚â• 6 years old were less commonly observed in the omicron variant predominant period. The number of patients requiring noninvasive oxygen support was higher in the omicron predominant period than that in the delta predominant period; however, intensive care unit admission rates were similar and no patients died in both periods.

Conclusions: In the omicron variant predominant period, more pediatric COVID-19 patients experienced fever and seizures, although the overall outcomes were still favorable.

Discussion
----------
This study revealed that several clinical symptoms, including fever, seizures, and vomiting, were more common in the omicron variant predominant period than in the delta variant predominant period; however, the ICU admission rates were similar in those 2 periods in COVID-19 hospitalized pediatric patients in Japan.

Changes in clinical manifestations during the omicron variant predominant period have been reported mainly from adult populations.

Information regarding clinical manifestations of COVID-19 in children with the omicron variant is still limited.

Furthermore, the interpretation of the frequency of COVID-19 symptoms in children is more complex than in adults because of the difficulty of interpreting subjective symptom complaints at younger ages in children and differences in the frequency of symptoms at different ages [15]. Hence, we compared the frequency of symptoms of the delta and omicron variant predominant periods by age group and excluded subjective symptoms in the young age groups that had difficulty in explaining their symptoms. In addition, it should be noted that younger age groups may underestimate subjective symptoms.

The severity and outcomes of COVID-19 with the omicron variant are important issues. Many COVID-19 related studies in the adult population reported that COVID-19 during the omicron variant predominant period was less severe than during other periods, including the delta variant predominant period [11],[12],[16]. A similar trend was reported for COVID-19 in children.

In conclusion, fever and seizures were more common in the omicron variant predominant period; however, overall severity was still low and outcomes were favorable. The clinical characteristics of COVID-19 can change depending on the predominant variant strain at the time, and therefore, it is necessary to keep the data updated.

A total of 16 schoolchildren, aged between 5 and 11, received their 1st dose of coronavirus vaccines at a programme in the capital yesterday [11 Aug 2022].

The vaccine shots, specially made for children by Pfizer, were administered on a "trial basis" yesterday [11 Aug 2022] before a campaign is scheduled to begin for inoculating children on [25 Aug 2022].

[NND], a grade-III student of Abul Bashar Government Primary School in the capital's Sher-E-Bangla Nagar area, is the first child to receive the vaccine in Bangladesh at the event at Bangabandhu International Conference Center.

"Today [11 Aug 2022] we are vaccinating children on a trial basis. We will vaccinate schoolchildren in the city corporation areas from 25 Aug 2022 and then the campaign will be expanded countrywide," Health Minister Zahid Maleque said while inaugurating the event as chief guest.

Education minister Dipu Moni, US ambassador to Bangladesh Peter Haas, and top officials of different ministries and development partner organisations attended the event.

Dipu Moni informed some 98% of students, aged between 12 and 18, have received the 1st dose of COVID-19 vaccines and 83% received the 2nd dose.

"There will be no obstacle in continuing academic activities once these children [aged between 5 and 11] are vaccinated."

After receiving vaccines, a colourful balloon was gifted to each child yesterday [11 Aug 2022].

Shyamoli Rani Malakar, headmaster of Abul Bashar Government Primary School, said the guardians expressed their interest in getting their children jabbed as the school authorities contacted them.

"We have had experience from today's [11 Aug 2022] event. We will set up vaccination centres at the schools. We need a few more days to finalise the schedule," Shamsul Haque, member secretary of the COVID-19 Vaccine Management Taskforce Committee, told The Daily Star.

There are 21 932 638 primary schoolchildren in the country, according to the directorate of primary education. There are also many children of this age group studying in madrassas, and kindergarten schools and engaged in child labour across the country while many are living a life on the streets.

The Directorate General of Health Services, however, has so far received 30 lakh [3 million] Pfizer vaccines made especially for children. "The vaccine stock will rise to one crore [10 million] by the end of this month [August 2022]," Shamsul Haque told The Daily Star earlier.

Meanwhile, the DGHS has reported 214 new cases of COVID-19 and one death in the past 24 hours until 8:00 am yesterday [11 Aug 2022], read a press release.

The number of children who are currently receiving treatment for dengue virus and also for COVID-19 at the Lady Ridgeway Hospital (LRH) in Colombo is increasing, LRH Consultant Paediatrician Dr. Deepal Perera said.

He told the Daily Mirror that they found 25 dengue-positive cases -- 18 with normal dengue fever, and another 8 with dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) are being treated at the hospital.

Meanwhile, he stated that 9 normal COVID-19-positive children are being treated at the COVID wards, and another 2 patients are at the hospital's intensive care unit (ICU).

The number of dengue and COVID-positive cases were found after random checking on the patients. "If we have checked all the patients, the number would have been more," Dr. Perera said.

Therefore, the doctor advised the people to clean their environment, including their homes and school premises. He also advised following basic health guidelines again to prevent children from getting infected with the COVID-19 virus.

Afghanistan: 188 506 / 7755 / 190
Maldives: 184 591 / 307 / 548
Bhutan: 60 663 / 21 / 27

Over the last 7 days, 115 969, 1636, 3595, 3325, and 1341 COVID-19 cases were detected in India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nepal, and Sri Lanka, respectively, compared with 127 858, 2458, 4659, 3404, and 853 in the preceding 7 days, revealing a declining trend in India after a stable phase over the previous 2 weeks, a continuation of the steady declining trend in Bangladesh, a decreasing trend also in Pakistan after a state of stability over the previous 2 weeks, a state of stability in Nepal, but a continuation of the increasing trend in Sri Lanka.

The daily case positivity in Bangladesh against the number of samples tested has dropped to around 4% from the highest positivity rate of around 17% seen in the current wave of the disease (https://dghs-dashboard.com/pages/covid19.php). As indicated in item [A], as part of mass vaccination with a Pfizer vaccine especially made for children, Bangladesh has initiated a COVID-19 mass vaccination in children between 5 and 11 years of age. As part of a trial vaccination for this initiative, a total of 16 schoolchildren received the vaccine on 11 Aug 2022. A mass-scale vaccination in children under this age group is expected to begin in the country on 25 Aug 2022.

In the last 7 days, the total number of people who died due to COVID-19 was 328 in India compared with 342 in the previous week, 10 in Bangladesh compared with 16 in the previous week, 15 in Pakistan compared with 22 in the previous week, 13 in Nepal compared with 7 in the previous week, and 31 in Sri Lanka compared with 26 in the previous week. The cases in children are reportedly increasing in Sri Lanka, as indicated in item [D] above.

The trends of daily confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths attributed to the disease in Pakistan can be seen at https://covid19.who.int/region/emro/country/pk, and the temporal trends of cases and deaths in Nepal can be seen at https://covid19.who.int/region/searo/country/np.

A mass media report citing a report from WHO indicated an increase of COVID-19 cases in Afghanistan along with multiple outbreaks of some other diseases, such as diarrhea, measles, Congo hemorrhagic fever, and dengue (https://www.khaama.com/multiple-disease-outbreaks-hit-afghanistan-who-38498/).

As of 12 Aug 2022, at 8:00 AM IST (GMT+5:30) India has administered 2 074 719 034 doses of the COVID-19 vaccine (https://www.mohfw.gov.in/).
