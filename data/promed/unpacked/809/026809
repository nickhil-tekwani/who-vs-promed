ACUTE RESPIRATORY SYNDROME -- INDONESIA
======================================
Date: Monday., 5 Mar 1996
From: <dpreslar@fas.org> ex wire service reports

Wire services report that an outbreak of upper respiratory tract infection
has taken 229 persons in the remote Indonesian province of Irian Jaya. Of
this number, 120 died in the Borme and Okbibab subdistrict; 109 died in
Trikora and Wamena subdistrict.
According to a report from the official Antara news agency, reports of the
deaths, which started in January, were delayed by poor communications
between the villages and public health officials. Due to the terrain,
journeys between villages can take up to 6 days on foot. Because of this,
the current death tally may be incomplete.
