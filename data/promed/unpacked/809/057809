Dongguan, in South China's Guangdong Province, reported one new case of H5N6 bird flu on Tuesday [21 Sep 2021], the 2nd confirmed case in the province after a woman was infected with the virus on 19 Aug [2021] in Huizhou. Experts assessed that the case was a random one, and the risk of transmission of the virus is low at the current stage.

According to the Health Commission of Guangdong Province, the diagnosed patient, surnamed [L], a 53-year-old male, is currently being treated at a designated hospital in Dongguan.

Experts pointed out that the H5N6 avian influenza virus is highly pathogenic to fowls. Since it was first discovered in poultry in China in 2008, it has gradually replaced the H5N1 avian influenza as the main virus prevalent in China's poultry farms and live poultry markets.

But in its natural state, the H5N6 avian influenza virus mainly infects birds, and infections in humans rarely occur. As of the end of March 2021, only 25 human infections have been reported worldwide, and all are dispersed cases.

On 12 Apr [2021], the H5N6 avian flu was found in wild birds in Shenyang, a city in Northeast China's Liaoning Province, which marked the 1st confirmed cases of the flu in China this year [2021].

After May 2014, H5N6 human infection cases have been reported in several places in China, including Sichuan, Guangdong, Yunnan, and Jiangxi provinces, where at least 4 people have died.

Experts from the Health Commission of Guangdong Province concluded that the emergence of the case was random and the risk of transmission of the virus is relatively low now. However, they warned that, although the H5N6 avian influenza virus rarely infects humans, it should be given high priority and remain under surveillance to avoid the spread of the epidemic by human factors.

[ProMED thanks Mahmoud Orabi for the latest reports on a human case of avian influenza A/H5N6 from China.

To date [27 Sep 2021], 44 human cases of avian influenza A(H5N6) have been reported in mainland China, the latest reported case being the 20th case in 2021.The last case from Guangdong was reported in August 2021 [See Avian influenza, human (16): China (Guangdong) H5N6 20210825.8611614].

According to reports received by the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), various influenza A(H5) subtypes continue to be detected in birds in Africa, Europe, and Asia.

Whenever avian influenza viruses are circulating in poultry, there is a risk for sporadic infection and small clusters of human cases due to exposure to infected poultry or contaminated environments. Therefore, sporadic human cases are not unexpected. Intensive surveillance should be continued to detect cases and early changes in transmissibility and infectivity of these viruses, as the frequency of cases is increasing. - Mod.UBA
