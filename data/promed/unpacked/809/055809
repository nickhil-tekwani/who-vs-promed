Source: CDC: Update -- Summertime flu outbreak among Alaska tourists

An influenza A outbreak is continuing to occur among tourists visiting
Alaska and the Yukon Territory. CDC and Health Canada first reported the
outbreak in late June 1999, and cases of respiratory illness have continued
to occur among travelers and tourist industry workers in the region. The
risk for illness among tourists traveling on week-long cruises has stayed
the same since mid-June. In summer 1998, another outbreak of influenza A
was identified among Alaska and Yukon Territory tourists and tourist
industry workers. It continued until the end of the tourist season. As in
the outbreak last summer, many travelers who are visiting the area on
combination land-sea tours are becoming ill on land before boarding cruise
ships.
Laboratory surveillance has identified influenza A (H3N2) Sydney-like virus
as the cause of most illnesses. This strain is similar to the predominant
influenza virus that circulated in the United States during the 1998-99
influenza season. Therefore, recommendations that CDC and Health Canada
issued in late June [1999 will remain in place for the duration of the
outbreak.
Persons 65 years and older or those who have chronic health problems (such
as diabetes, lung or heart conditions) or weak immune systems are at
high-risk for complications of flu and should see their health-care
provider before they travel. Health-care providers should inform patients
who are at high-risk from complications of flu and who plan to travel to
this region about both the symptoms and potential complications of
influenza. Providers should also discuss with these patients whether they
should carry antiviral medication to either prevent or treat influenza A.
Antiviral medication (rimantadine or amantadine) can shorten influenza A
illness if given within 48 hours of becoming ill. Rapid diagnostic tests
are available that can be used to diagnose influenza A infection. As the
1999-2000 influenza vaccine becomes available in the United States, persons
at high risk for complications of influenza should be offered influenza
vaccine at least two weeks before they travel, if they were not vaccinated
during the previous fall or winter.
