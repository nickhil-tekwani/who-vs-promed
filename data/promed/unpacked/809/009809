The official news agency of Ghana reports 6 meningitis deaths in the Upper
West region of Ghana, and 3 deaths in the Upper East area.
According to a senior public health officer in the Upper West, health
centres in the region now have sufficient vaccines for those who were not
vaccinated during last year's major outbreak.

[This time last year ProMED-mail reported on a major outbreak of
meningococcal meningitis in West Africa, including Ghana (see citations
above). A major immunization campaign was said to be part of the response
at that time. We would appreciate additional information should
significant numbers of cases begin to accumulate again this year. - Mod.ES
