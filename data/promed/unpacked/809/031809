Foot and mouth disease in Botswana
----------------------------------
Information received on (and dated) 4 May 2006 from Dr Musa Fanikiso,
director of animal health and production, Ministry of Agriculture, Gaborone:
End of previous report period: 26 Apr 2006 (Disease Information 2006;
19[17]: 362, 27 Apr)
Identification of agent: foot and mouth disease (FMD) virus serotype SAT2.
Date of start of the event: 11 Apr 2006.
New outbreaks: In the Central Region at Selibe Phikwe, there have been 7
outbreaks in cattle: at Bobonong, Lentswe le Mokabi, Lepokole, Majande,
Marapalalo, Matsaganeng, and Mosalakwane. The highest mortality outbreaks
were at Lentswe le Mokabi, with 349 affected and 89 deaths, and at
Matsaganeng, with 590 affected and 73 deaths.
Description of affected population: the affected population is within a
communal farming area.
Diagnosis:
Laboratory where diagnostic tests were performed: Botswana Vaccine
Institute, Gaborone
ELISA, virus neutralization and virus isolation were positive for serotype
SAT2.
Source of outbreak or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive.
Other details/comments:
- The epicenter of the infection is located at Sekgopye, and the
international boundary forms the north and the north eastern perimeter. The
estimated population is about 25 000 cattle within the infected area and
about 75 000 cattle within the surveillance zone.
- There is no evidence of the disease in the rest of the country. In zone
6, in a 10 km wide surveillance zone, 5700 cattle were clinically
inspected, and none showed clinical signs of FMD. Another 10 km
surveillance zone was established in zones 8 and 9 and, to date, 1400
cattle have been inspected, with negative results.
- The entire zone 7 has been blockaded, and movement restriction and
disinfection have been enforced. Investigations are in progress to
determine the source of the infection, and phylogenetic analyses are being
undertaken.
Final report: no.
