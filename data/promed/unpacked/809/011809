A cattle breeding ranch in Estacion Munoz, in the Partido of Olavarria, province of Buenos Aires, has suffered 15 deaths characteristic of anthrax. The veterinarian was only called in to see the last 4 dead animals. He reported acute deaths, exsanguination from the natural openings (mouth, nose, anus, etc), splenomegaly, and the herd had not been vaccinated against anthrax. He submitted metacarpal bones for laboratory confirmation and _Bacillus anthracis_ was cultured from the bone medullas.

One person was reported to be at risk from exposure to the carcasses whilst removing the hides.

The _B. anthracis_ isolate was sensitive to the usual veterinary antibiotics but was resistant to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole.

The estancia is in an area of "campos malditos" [or "champs maudit" if you prefer the French for long term and severely contaminated grazing] where anthrax outbreaks are routinely observed. The carcasses were treated in the standard manner with "tapado controlado", [or covered in lime and then by a thick plastic tarpaulin, weighted around the periphery. After 9 months the lime is removed, and the bones, hide, and any remaining tissue removed, burnt, and buried.]

[If people did as they were told, I suspect we would have little or nothing to do. This region of Buenos Aires Province is under routine advice to regularly vaccinate their cattle. The risk is well known. And yet some procrastinate, just as they do elsewhere, and thereby provide repeated reminders of why it is important in this high risk areas to regularly vaccinate stock. - Mod.MHJ
