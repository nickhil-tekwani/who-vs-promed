Today [10 Feb 2014] the Mississippi State Department of Health (MSDH) reports the state's 1st human case of West Nile virus (WNV) for 2014. The reported case is in Hinds County. The MSDH only reports laboratory-confirmed cases to the public. In 2013, Mississippi had 45 WNV cases and 5 deaths.

"From time to time, we do see cases reported this early in Mississippi. While it does seem surprising given all the winter weather we've had this season [2013-2014], it serves as a good reminder that WNV can occur year-round, even if we are not in the peak summer months of July, August, and September," said MSDH State Epidemiologist Dr Thomas Dobbs.

"Also, the timeframe of when the 1st case is reported has no effect on the type of WNV activity we'll see in a particular season. There really is no way to predict how active the season will be," said Dobbs.

Symptoms of WNV infection are often mild and may include fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, a rash, muscle weakness, or swollen lymph nodes. In a small number of cases, infection can result in encephalitis or meningitis, which can lead to paralysis, coma, and possibly death.

[Interestingly, last year (2013), the 1st human West Nile virus (WNV) infection was reported in April (see ProMED-mail archive no 20130409.1633975). The current case has occurred very early in the usual WNV transmission season.

Although cases early in the season may not be predictive of increased cases during the normal seasonal summer peak, it would be prudent to maintain good surveillance in the area where the individual became infected. And the public needs to be reminded of the need to avoid mosquito bites as advised in the "fight the bite" campaigns. Also, horse owners are well advised to be sure that their animals have been vaccinated.
