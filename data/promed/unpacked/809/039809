A new outbreak of avian influenza (bird flu) has been reported in 85 local government areas in 21 states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), the Federal Government [Nigeria] has said. Cases of bird flu were 1st reported in January [2015] by the government in over 11 states.

The government said the new outbreak which has been reported in Lagos, Ogun, Rivers, Oyo, Enugu, Abia and the FCT, occurred between July [2015] and last month [September 2015]. The permanent secretary of the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, Sonny Echono, who spoke at a meeting with stakeholders in the poultry industry, said that 491 farmers have been affected by the disease. Echono said that 1 597 191 birds have been depopulated so far.

The permanent secretary said government has started the decontamination of affected farms and birds to curtail the spread of the disease. He said: "As you are probably aware, the resurgence of avian influenza as at today has spread to 85 local government areas (LGAs) in 21 states and the FCT, affecting 491 farms. The disease has continued to spread mainly in the southern states and the latest outbreaks reported between July and September, 2015 in Lagos, Oyo, Ogun, Enugu, Abia, Rivers, and FCT. These new outbreaks have been attributed to non-compliance to biosecurity in farms, limited awareness creation on disease among poultry farmers, disregard to public policy on sitting of poultry farms and other enforcement protocols which are expected to be implemented by the states."

Echono said government has agreed to pay NGN 1.1 billion [about USD 5.5 million] as compensation to 138 affected farmers.
