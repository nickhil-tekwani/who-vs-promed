This comment [by CHC, regarding the presence of _Aedes_ mosquitoes and
their capacities to transmit dengue viruses] on the possible role of _Aedes
albopictus_ in the transmission of dengue virus[es] reminds me that there
is Brazilian speculation that this species is not important in our country,
mostly at Sao Paulo State, where there is not transmission in the regions
without _Aedes aegypti_, just with _Ae. albopictus_.
Are the Brazilian populations not efficient in the transmission of the
specific virus here? Experimental infection [has been] obtained. Are there
other places with just _Ae. albopictus_ and no transmission?

_Aedes albopictus_ is a tree-hole [breeding] _Aedes_ sp. that has become
adapted to the human environment, although it is not as closely associated
with humans as is _Ae. aegypti_. It is highly susceptible to oral
infection by dengue viruses, and is a known vector of dengue [viruses].
However, it is probably not as effective a vector as _Ae. aegypti_, mainly
because it bites many different species (as opposed to _Ae. aegypti_, which
bites humans in preference to other urban animals). However there are
several places in the world where dengue transmission occurs and _Ae.
albopictus_ is the only one present of the two species.

[Let me put it this way: is there any place in the world where _Ae.
albopictus_ has been known to occur for a long period of time and there is
no dengue known in that area? - Mod.CHC]
