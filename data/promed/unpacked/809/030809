Wild horses managed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) were found
dead late last week [16-22 Jul 2007] and additional horses have died
since the discovery. The cause of death for 40 wild horses is under
investigation.
The horses died near a water source in the extreme northwest portion
of the herd management area, about 210 miles (338 km) northwest of
Las Vegas, which is within the US Air Force Nevada Test and Training Range.
The military alerted BLM late Friday [20 Jul 2007] that they had seen
some dead horses. The area is restricted to public access and the Air
Force is providing access to the BLM. On Saturday [21 Jul 2007], BLM
went to the site and found 25 dead wild horses and an antelope.
A water pond on a dry lakebed is suspected to be the source of the
problem. BLM and the military are placing a water trough and are
hauling water. Water samples have been collected and a USDA/APHIS (US
Department of Agriculture/Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service)
veterinarian is at the site today [25 Jul 2007] to assess horse
health and perform a necropsy. Samples will be sent to the California
Animal Health and Food Safety Laboratory in Tulare, CA, for analysis.
Preliminary results are expected by Friday [27 Jul 2007]; toxicology
testing will be conducted by U.C. Davis (University of California)
and could take up to a week.
About 250 wild horses use this part of the herd area and about 70 of
those animals use the area near the pond. The pond has been a source
of water for the herd since the early 1980s. BLM and the military are
determining the best way to segregate the pond from the horses.
The BLM will provide information when test results are obtained and
as other actions are taken.
These horses are in a different part of the Nevada Wild Horse Range
than the area where BLM conducted an emergency gather earlier in July
[2007]. BLM removed 178 wild horses on the eastern edge of the range
because of a lack of water. BLM has scheduled a gather to remove
about 800 to 850 excess wild horses from the herd area in December
[2007] to bring the herd to an appropriate management level of 300
animals. There are 1100 to 1150 wild horses in the herd area at this time.

[Since the BLM previously moved horses because of lack of water and
these were found dead near a source of water, I would suspect
something like one of the toxic blue-green algae or cyanobacteria.
However, conditions to promote growth of cyanobacteria require a
source of nitrogen or phosphorus, such as occurs through runoff after
a rain. Generally Nevada is dry, but they could have had some rain
with conditions right to promote growth of cyanobacteria.
Another possibility is the concentrations of salt. However, it
generally difficult to convince horses to consume water that is too
salty. Extreme water deprivation may promote such consumption though.
We look forward to reports that should give us more insight into the
cause of death. - Mod.TG
