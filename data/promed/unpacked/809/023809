Grapevine flavescence doree phytoplasma in Italy
------------------------------------------------
Considering the economic importance of Grapevine flavescence doree
phytoplasma [Gfdp] (EPPO A2 quarantine pest), surveys and compulsory
control are being implemented in Italy. Efforts are also being made to
identify the phytoplasma species that are associated with grapevine yellows.
So far, Gfdp has been found only in northern Italy (Osler & Refatti, 2002).
Its vector, _Scaphoideus titanus_, is present in most grapevine-growing
areas of northern Italy. Severe outbreaks of the disease are present in the
grapevine-growing regions of Piemonte, Lombardia, and Veneto.
The disease is expanding in Liguria and Emilia-Romagna (Piacenza and Reggio
Emilia), but growers are trying to delay or prevent its spread by
eliminating diseased plants and controlling the vector. In areas where the
first severe outbreaks of the disease had been detected and where the
vector had been controlled, the number of new diseased grapevines is
decreasing.
Bois noir (stolbur) occurs practically in all regions of northern Italy,
occasionally with flavescence doree. Symptoms of bois noir are rarely
severe, and plant recovery may be observed. Bois noir occurs only in the
eastern provinces of Emilia-Romagna (Valtellina), in most part of
Friuli-Venezia Giulia, and in Trento province (Trentino-Alto Adige).
Details on the situation in northern Italy:
Emilia-Romagna: found recently in the west part of this region,
particularly in Piacenza and Reggio Emilia provinces and occasionally in
isolated foci in Parma and Modena provinces.
Liguria: found on the west part of the coast.
Lombardia: severe outbreaks occurred in most parts of this region in
Oltrepo pavese, and Mantova and Brescia provinces. Isolated findings were
reported in Cremona, Mantova, and Vicenza provinces.
Friuli-Venezia Giulia: found near Pordenone (see EPPO RS 2003/042).
Piemonte: found in 3 provinces (Alessandria, Asti, and Cuneo).
Trentino-Alto Adige: first foci were found in 2001 near infested zones in
Veneto.
Veneto: found in a large part of this region (Padova, Treviso, Vicenza, and
Verona provinces).
In central and southern Italy (Barba & Albanese, 2002), bois noir was
frequently detected. Gfdp was not detected, except for a finding in March 2002.
Gfdp was detected in a few 35 year old grapevines, but its vector
_Scaphoideus titanus_ could not be found. The risk of spread towards
southern Italy cannot be ruled out.
The situation of Grapevine flavescence doree phytoplasma in Italy can be
described as follows: Present, found in northern Italy (Emilia-Romagna,
Liguria, Lombardia, Friuli-Venezia Guilia, Piemonte, Trentino-Alto Adige,
Veneto), under official control.

2003/059 Grapevine flavescence doree is suspected in Serbia (YU)
----------------------------------------------------------------
During a survey done in 2002 in Serbia, samples were collected from
grapevines showing typical symptoms of a phytoplasma disease: leaf rolling,
red discoloration, vein chlorosis and necrosis, and absence of lignification.
Plant material was collected in one grapevine-growing region (Zupa
Aleksandrovac) where the disease has been observed since 2000 with an
increasing incidence from year to year. Molecular studies revealed the
presence of phytoplasmas belonging to the elm yellows subgroup 16SrV-C,
therefore suggesting the presence of grapevine flavescence doree
phytoplasma (EPPO A2 quarantine pest). Further studies are being carried
out to verify the presence of the insect vector, _Scaphoideus titanus_, and
confirm that this grapevine yellows is associated with grapevine
flavescence doree phytoplasma.

[There may be other phytoplasmas in addition to grapevine flavescence doree
in Italian and Serbian grapevines. The availability of molecular techniques
will facilitate their identification and characterization. Gpdf occurs
worldwide, causing significant damage to grapevines. - Mod.DH]
