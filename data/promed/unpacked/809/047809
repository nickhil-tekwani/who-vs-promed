Animal health authorities believe botched testing of imported pet dogs could be behind the recently discovered outbreak of an exotic and potentially deadly dog disease in northern Australia.

The tick-borne disease ehrlichiosis was first detected in Australia in May [2020] in Western Australia's Kimberley region, sparking an investigation into how it got to Australia.

Australia's chief veterinary officer, Dr Mark Schipp, said ehrlichiosis had likely circulated undetected in northern Australia for months or years, but the exact timing of the introduction was unknown. "It must have come in on a dog imported into Australia," he said.

Imported pet dogs are not required to be tested for the exotic tick-borne disease in Australia, provided they have been cleared by testing in their country of origin.

However, Dr Schipp said, the system was not foolproof.

"The testing is not 100% reliable, and we know we've had situations where dogs have tested negative, and after being imported they've been found to be infected."

[ML], a Melbourne woman, made formal complaints about flawed overseas tests for imported pet dogs 5 years ago but said nothing was done. She raised the alarm about inaccurate test results in 2015 after her dog, Ollie, tested negative for the disease in Europe but positive in Australia.

Ollie was tested once he arrived in Australia only because his tick treatment had lapsed by one day.

"It wasn't a slightly different result; it was negative [in Europe] all the way up to critically positive results in Australia," she said. "It has just shown a huge issue with the system, as far as the testing of these diseases, and I personally believe that's how it got into the country."

After his positive test, Ollie was deported back to Europe, beginning an 18-month ordeal involving travel to several countries to be properly tested and Ollie's recovery from the bacterial disease.

[ML] said she made formal complaints to the Department of Agriculture and Commonwealth Ombudsman, but her warnings went unheeded.

In a statement, a spokesperson for the Department of Agriculture said there was no international standard for testing procedures of ehrlichiosis.

"Australia only accepts laboratory test results for dogs being imported if they have been conducted in an approved country, and by a laboratory that is recognised by the government of the country of export," the spokesperson said.

The spokesperson said the recent detection of the disease had not changed the import requirements for dogs entering Australia.

Pending the results of an investigation into the outbreak of ehrlichiosis in Australia, the spokesperson said a review of the import conditions may be enacted.

[ML] was finally able to bring Ollie home to Australia in 2017. "We spent thousands and thousands of dollars getting the poor dog blood tested all around the world, trying to get him home," she said.

[ML] hopes other dogs and families can be spared from a similar situation, and other exotic diseases can be stopped at the border by fixing what she considers to be a broken system.

Key points:
- Botched testing of imported pet dogs could be behind Australia's 1st outbreak of ehrlichiosis.
- Imported dogs are not required to be tested in Australia, as long as they have been tested in an approved country.
- A Melbourne pet owner raised the alarm about flawed overseas tests 5 years ago and claims her protests were ignored.

[This is a frustrating situation for the animal owners. It may be not that the test is faulty, but that perhaps there are differences in sensitivities between the different types of tests. It may also be the situation is further complicated by countries using different types of tests. It seems for import/export purposes, countries perhaps should consider a standard test format (for example, PCR or ELISA or whatever is appropriate for the organism or diseases being tested for). Or at least the type of test should be specified on the import requirements, and this would allow the individual to request the veterinarian or the laboratory to use a particular type of test to meet the import requirements. The multiple testing, different countries, etc. is expensive and distressing to owner and animals and would be unnecessary if the type of testing was specified.

One also has to wonder why the dog was not put on a course of the antibiotic doxycycline and then retested there in Australia.

There are many species of _Ehrlichia_, and those different species may be transmitted by a number of different species of ticks.

_Ehrlichia canis_ is transmitted by the brown dog tick, _Rhipicephalus sanguineus_, which is found worldwide; accordingly, canine monocytic ehrlichiosis also has a worldwide enzootic distribution. Acute _E. canis_ cases may resemble infection with _Rickettsia rickettsii_ (the agent of Rocky Mountain spotted fever, which can also be transmitted by the brown dog tick). _Rhipicephalus_ ticks become infected with _E. canis_ after feeding on infected dogs, and ticks transmit infection to other dogs during blood meals taken in successive life stages. Blood transfusions, or other means by which infected white blood cells [WBCs] can be transferred, may also transmit the pathogen. _Ehrlichia chaffeensis_ and _Ehrlichia ewingii_ have sylvan cycles in the environment that involve tick species and wildlife reservoir hosts.

In dogs, _E. canis_ causes the most potentially severe clinical presentation of the _Ehrlichia_ spp. Signs arise from involvement of the hemic and lymphoreticular systems and commonly progress from acute to chronic, depending on the strain of organism and immune status of the host.

Clinical findings in acute cases include:
- reticuloendothelial hyperplasia
- fever
- generalized lymphadenopathy
- splenomegaly
- thrombocytopenia

Variable signs of anorexia, depression, loss of stamina, stiffness and reluctance to walk, edema of the limbs or scrotum, and coughing or dyspnea may be seen. Most acute cases are seen in the warmer months, coincident with the greatest activity of the tick vector. Chronic cases may present at any time of year.

During the acute phase of _E. canis_ infection in dogs, the hemogram is usually normal but may reflect a mild normocytic, normochromic anemia; leukopenia; or mild leukocytosis. Thrombocytopenia is common, but petechiae may not be evident, and platelet decreases may be mild in some animals. Vasculitis and immune-mediated mechanisms induce a thrombocytopenia and hemorrhagic tendencies. Lymph node aspiration reveals hyperplasia. Death is rare during this phase; spontaneous recovery may occur, the dog may remain asymptomatic, or chronic disease may ensue.

Chronic ehrlichiosis caused by _E. canis_ may develop in any breed, but certain breeds, e.g., German shepherds, may be predisposed. Seasonality is not a specific hallmark of chronic infection, because appearance of chronic signs may be variably delayed after acute infection. In chronic cases, the bone marrow becomes hypoplastic, and lymphocytes and plasmacytes infiltrate various organs.

Clinical findings vary based on the predominant organs affected and may include:
- marked splenomegaly
- glomerulonephritis
- renal failure
- interstitial pneumonitis
- anterior uveitis
- meningitis (with associated cerebellar ataxia, depression, paresis, and hyperesthesia)
- severe weight loss

The hemogram is usually markedly abnormal in chronic cases. Severe thrombocytopenia may cause epistaxis, hematuria, melena, and petechiae and ecchymoses of the skin. Variably severe pancytopenia (mature leukopenia, nonregenerative anemia, thrombocytopenia, or any combination thereof) may be seen. Aspiration cytology reveals reactive lymph nodes and, usually, marked plasmacytosis. Frequently, polyclonal, or occasionally monoclonal, hypergammaglobulinemia develops.

Other ehrlichial infections caused by _E. chaffeensis_, _E. ewingii_, or _A. phagocytophilum_ appear clinically similar to acute _E. canis_ infection, but the clinical course is usually more self-limiting. Shifting leg lameness and fever of unknown origin may be present. Thrombocytopenia and mild leukopenia or leukocytosis may occur during the acute course of infection, which is clinically more discrete. Chronic canine disease, as seen with _E. canis_ infection, is not typically seen with other infections.

Lesions:
During the acute or self-limiting phase of _E. canis_ infections, lesions generally are nonspecific, but splenomegaly is common. Histologically, there is lymphoreticular hyperplasia and lymphocytic and plasmacytic perivascular cuffing. In chronic cases, these lesions may be accompanied by widespread hemorrhage and increased mononuclear cell infiltration in perivascular regions of many organs.

Diagnosis of ehrlichiosis:
Because thrombocytopenia is a relatively consistent finding with ehrlichiosis infections, a platelet count is an important screening test. Clinical diagnosis may be confirmed by demonstrating the organisms within WBCs or platelets, seen in intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies called morulae. This method of diagnosis lacks sensitivity, because low numbers of organisms make demonstration difficult.

Most often, a diagnosis is made by a combination of
- clinical signs;
- positive serum indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) titer; and
- response to treatment.

In-house tests for _E. canis_, _A. phagocytophilum_, _A. platys_, and _E. ewingii_ based on enzyme immunoassay methods are also available. The antibody response may be delayed for several weeks; thus, serologic testing may not be a reliable diagnostic tool early in the course of the disease. [This statement may explain why a serologic test may not be accurate, especially early on in the disease. It may also account for why the person in the article felt the test was flawed. - Mod.TG] Furthermore, antibodies can persist for months or years after infection, making in-house tests for the organisms problematic for confirmation of acute infection, particularly in highly enzootic areas where many dogs may have antibodies to these agents because of previous infections.

Testing of paired sera and demonstration of increased antibody titers is recommended to confirm infection when possible, although treatment of suspected cases should never be delayed or withheld on the basis of test results, either positive or negative. Serologic cross-reactivity is strong between _E. canis_, _E. chaffeensis_, and _E. ewingii_; some cross-reactivity to _A. phagocytophilum_ is also seen. In people, the EML agent shows cross-reactivity to _E. chaffeensis_. In some areas, about 50% of dogs infected with _E. canis_ also have a titer to _A. platys_, which likely reflects coinfection; cross-reactivity between these agents is not seen.

PCR has been used to detect and identify specific _Ehrlichia_ and _Anaplasma_ species in infected people and animals. Samples appropriate for PCR include blood, tissue aspirates, or biopsy specimens of reticuloendothelial organs, such as lymph nodes, spleen, liver, or bone marrow. PCR can also be used to detect the effectiveness of treatment in clearing infection. PCR is not routinely available through commercial veterinary laboratories, although some veterinary schools and research institutions offer it. PCR is available through several commercial human laboratories.

Differential diagnoses for ehrlichiosis:
Acute stage:
- Rocky Mountain spotted fever
- brucellosis
- blastomycosis
- endocarditis
- systemic lupus erythematosus
- lymphosarcoma
Chronic stage:
- estrogen toxicity
- myelophthisis
- immune-mediated pancytopenia
- multisystemic diseases associated with specific organ dysfunction (e.g., glomerulonephritis)

Treatment of ehrlichiosis:
To treat infection with _Ehrlichia_ and _Anaplasma_ spp., the drug of choice is doxycycline because of its superior intracellular penetration and bacteriostatic properties against rickettsiae. Doxycycline is recommended for dogs of all ages. If infection is suspected, dogs should be treated empirically; treatment should not be withheld or delayed pending laboratory results. Early seronegative tests should not be considered a reason to stop therapy, because antibodies may take [one week or longer] to develop in acute cases.

Recommended drug dosages for treatment of ehrlichiosis:
- doxycycline: 5-10 mg/kg/day, PO or IV, for 10-21 days (drug of choice)
- tetracycline: 22 mg/kg, PO, tid (greater than or equal to 2 weeks, acute cases; 1-2 months, chronic cases)
- imidocarb diproprionate: 2 doses, 5-7 mg/kg, IM, 2 weeks apart (also effective for some strains of babesiosis)

In acute cases receiving appropriate antibiotic therapy, body temperature is expected to return to normal within 24-48 hours after treatment. In chronic cases associated with _E. canis_ infection, the hematologic abnormalities may persist for 3-6 months, although clinical response to treatment often occurs much sooner.

Supportive therapy may be necessary to combat wasting and specific organ dysfunction; platelet or whole-blood transfusions may be required if hemorrhage is extensive. Concurrent broad-spectrum antibiotics may be needed if the dog has severe leukopenia. The _E. canis_ antibody titer should be measured again within 6 months of illness to confirm a low or seronegative status indicative of successful therapy. Serum titers that persist at lower but positive levels should be rechecked in another 6 months to ensure that they are not increasing.

Prevention of ehrlichiosis:
Prevention of ehrlichiosis is enhanced by controlling ticks on dogs through use of reliable methods. In particular, medications and products with proven efficacy against _R. sanguineus_.

Zoonotic risk of ehrlichiosis:
_E. chaffeensis_, _E. ewingii_, and _A. phagocytophilum_ are considered zoonoses. Despite the occurrence of disease in both animals and people, the involvement of a required intermediate tick vector for transmission means dogs and other infected animals do not pose a direct transmission risk in normal circumstances. Infection in dogs may indicate a heightened risk of human infections related to tick exposure in a given area.

Prevention of transfusion-associated transmission can be reduced by using seronegative screened blood donors, although new donors with a negative screen cannot be presumed free of infection for several weeks because they may be incubating infection.
