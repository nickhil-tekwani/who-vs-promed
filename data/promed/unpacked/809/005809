A few months [ago] parts of Western Montana were dealing with a whooping cough outbreak. The Missoula City-County Health Department even had to hire extra nurses to handle the rising number of cases. The outbreak is continuing with local health officials saying that the numbers are still rising.

Local health officials said back in the spring [2019] that they expected the pertussis cases to slow down during summer break. But now, they say that even more cases are coming in -- with the most recent one reported Monday [5 Aug 2019].

"There's a little bit of a concern that it's still around, and that we have had some cases," said Cindy Farr with the Missoula City-County Health Department. "More of our cases that we've seen through the summer ... were not directly linked to other cases of pertussis, which is telling me that we still are seeing it in the community."

MTN News reported in May [2019] that there were 125 confirmed cases of pertussis in the Missoula area. That number has since risen to 160 cases. Farr says they hired extra nurses to go to schools this spring -- and she's hoping they won't have to do that again.

"A lot of kids are going in for their sports physicals right now, so this might be a good time to chat with your doctor about whooping cough," Farr advised. "And make sure that you're aware of what symptoms to watch out for in case we do see a resurgence of it once the school year starts."

Farr says babies should be vaccinated, and pregnant women, people between the ages of 10 and 12, and adults should receive the TDAP booster. She added that close contacts are the highest when children are in school. The TDAP vaccine takes 2 to 3 weeks to become effective, so she's encouraging parents to bring their children in before classes start back up.

[People] can contact the local health department at (406) 258-3363 for more information about immunizations. Vaccinations are available at the Missoula health department on West Alder Street. Most insurance plans are accepted, and they offer a sliding scale [for the] uninsured.

Pertussis, known as whooping cough, is circulating in several UP [Upper Peninsula of the US state of Michigan] communities, public health officials said Friday [16 Aug 2019].

Dr. Teresa Frankovich, the medical director of 4 Upper Michigan health departments, is asking that all UP adults check their immunization status and their children's immunization status. Frankovich says this is particularly important before kids head back to school, where it is even easier for pertussis to circulate.

She says there have been 10 cases in the past month or so, and 80% of the cases have been in children. Cases have occurred in the Dickinson-Iron, Delta-Menominee and Marquette County Health Department districts. Most medical providers and all health departments have vaccine on hand.

Frankovich notes that children normally receive the DTaP vaccine, which provides protection against pertussis, at 2, 4, 6 and 12-15 months of age, and a booster dose at 4-6 years of age. "Some parents may not realize that another booster dose (called Tdap), is now required for children at 11 years of age. This one-time booster is also recommended for adults who have not had a pertussis vaccine since childhood and is recommended for pregnant women with each pregnancy." Frankovich said.

"Because young infants are at highest risk for serious disease with pertussis, it is particularly important that expectant or new parents be vaccinated as well as grandparents and others who have close contact with young children."

The Extendicare Health and Rehabilitation Center has confirmed cases of the bacterial infection known as the "whooping cough." "We have a few confirmed cases here at the Extendicare, and there [have] been cases in Houston and Henry County," said Shenika Ford, Extendicare Administrator.

Cases of pertussis, better known as whooping cough, are popping up in the Wiregrass. Extendicare Health Center said they are working closely to end the spread of whooping cough. "We [are] working closely with Geneva Alabama Department of Public Health to contain the spread of whooping cough," she said.

Whooping cough does not only affect children but teenagers and adults as well. If an affected person coughs or sneezes, the bacteria spread within a matter of seconds.

Pertussis -- better known as whooping cough -- has swept across the state, with health departments diagnosing almost 12 times as many cases as last year [2018] at this time, and 2 cases have been diagnosed in Hill County by the end of last week [24 Aug 2019], Hill County Health Department Kim Larson said.

"Right now, Montana has 442 cases of pertussis this year [2019]," she said. "At the same time last year we only had 37 in the state of Montana, so there is a big increase this year."

In recent months, Blaine County has diagnosed 13 cases of pertussis; Liberty and Chouteau counties have each diagnosed 1; and Havre, 2 cases, the Montana Department of Health and Human Services website says. It added that Missoula County leads the state with 165 cases.

Blaine and Chouteau county health departments were unavailable for comment as of [the] print deadline today [27 Aug 2019], but the Health and Human Services site shows no new cases reported in those counties since the Havre Daily News' last story on the issue [23 Jul 2019]. Liberty County Health Nurse Melissa Kantorowicz said the county has not had any new cases diagnosed since that date. Larson said the Hill County Health Department has its nursing staff investigating the cases. She added that the nursing staff has already contacted people whom they are monitoring for symptoms.

Whooping cough is not normally diagnosed this time of year, she said, but with the school year starting and several other counties having diagnosed cases, people could have contracted the disease from multiple places and at any time.

Larson said if people have any other questions, they can call the Hill County Health Department at 400-2415.
