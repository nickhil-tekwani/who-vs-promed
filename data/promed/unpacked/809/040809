For the past 2 years, we used a computer model to predict the risk of
seasonal outbreaks for soybean rust during a growing season. This
year [2007], we improved the model and are making predictions using
this model together with information from sentinel plot data. Below
is an update of the occurrence of soybean rust and our seasonal
outlook.
Situation in the southeastern region
-------------------------------------
The source regions of soybean rust this year [2007], are in 3 areas
along the Gulf Coast: Texas, Louisiana, and the southeastern region,
including Florida and Georgia. For the eastern region, which has the
largest source area, the weather in Florida has been dry for the
entire month of May [2007], and that greatly slowed soybean rust
development. Spore movement has been limited to areas east of the
Appalachian Mountains.
In Louisiana, soybean rust was found in an area west of New Orleans.
Detection was 51 days earlier than in the previous 2 years. However,
computer modeling indicates little spore movement northward from that
source. No disease has been found anywhere north of New Orleans,
although local expansion has been observed. For the rest of June
[2007], computer models predict limited northward movement of this
disease from known Louisiana sources because the predicted weather
seems less favorable to the disease.
In Texas, a new occurrence of the disease was found along the Gulf of
Mexico north of Houston. No disease was found in areas where the
disease was 1st detected in winter. There were abundant rains in
Texas in the past few weeks, which were favorable to the occurrence
of soybean rust. However, predicted favorability for soybean rust
occurrence for Texas in June [2007] is less than 20 percent.
Like last year [2006], a system to monitor spores has been
established in the soybean production region by university scientists
with support from Syngenta. So far, the northernmost detection of
soybean rust spores was in South Carolina during the last week of
May. No disease has been found yet. The detection in South Carolina
was consistent with predicted spore movement. However, that finding
does not pose a significant threat to the North Central Region
because the disease normally does not move westward over the
Appalachian Mountains.
Future outlook
---------------
To determine the risk of soybean rust in the North Central Region,
what happens in the Gulf Coast states before the end of June [2007]
is critical.
Getting into July [2007], the weather will be too hot for soybean
rust to develop. For the period of May through the 1st week of June
[2007], there has been abundant rainfall in the Mississippi Basin and
the Great Plains Region, including Texas. Such weather is ideal for
soybean rust development, if spores and hosts are available. Luckily,
soybean plants were just planted. Arrival of spores was not predicted
by computer models. The possibility of having the disease occur in
areas beyond northern Louisiana into Arkansas and Kentucky and go
undetected is not high.
Our computer forecast shows that the month of June is less favorable
to the establishment of soybean rust in the entire soybean production
area because of less rain. The predicted spore movement from known
sources of soybean rust is also limited in the eastern region. We are
using a newly reported area in Texas for our next forecast. Since the
critical stage in the Gulf Coast Region is not over yet, we will
continue to watch what happens there. Disease occurrence in
mid-Mississippi is what we need to watch before the end of June
[2007].
Besides computer modeling and spore monitoring, we have another
safeguard system, sentinel plots, to protect us from any surprises.
In Iowa, all the sentinel plots have been planted.

Iowa State University (ISU) researchers have developed a way to use
satellite images to find Asian soybean rust. "What we did on the
ground 10 to 15 years ago, we can do now with satellites," said
Forrest Nutter, professor of plant pathology.
Using remote sensing, Global Positioning System (GPS), and
Geographical Information System technologies, scientists can measure
the green leaf area of soybeans to detect and identify diseases down
to the area of a square meter, about 1.2 square yards. "Plant
pathogens and pests impact the green leaf area index of crop canopies
in different ways and those changes can be detected and quantified
using remote sensing," Nutter said. The footprints of early soybean
rust infection are oval-shaped. The way it spreads over time in a
field helps identify it from other diseases.
Nutter envisions the technology being used to narrow the search for
soybean rust or other diseases. Plant disease detection using
satellites would provide the GPS coordinates for spotters on the
ground to pinpoint locations to collect disease diagnostic field
samples. The samples would then be taken in for laboratory tests to
confirm the identity of the plant disease at that location.
Tests conducted last year [2006] in South Africa demonstrated the
technology. Nutter has been working on the project with plant
pathologist Neil van Rij of Cedara, South Africa; John Basart, Iowa
State engineering professor; and Khalil Ahmad, engineering graduate
student. Nutter said the USDA (US Department of Agriculture) and the
Department of Homeland Security are interested in using the
technology to alert officials to a soybean rust infection during the
crop season. Being able to monitor the movement of soybean rust could
help reduce the impact of the devastating disease.

[3] Federal probe of soybean rust report - USA (IA)

Federal investigators are looking into how and why a single leaf
infected with Asian soybean rust was found in Iowa in March [2007].
Officials with the Iowa Department of Agriculture (IDA) and Land
Stewardship and Iowa State University (ISU) haven't found additional
evidence of the Asian rust in the field where the leaf was reported
to have come from or in neighboring fields. "We did verify that one
leaf submitted in a plant sample was infected with Asian soybean
rust, but how it got into Iowa still needs to be determined," said
Bill Northey, Iowa Secretary of Agriculture. "After careful
examination of the materials collected to date, we believe no Asian
soybean rust infection occurred during the 2006 growing season in
Iowa."
Iowa officials determined the situation warranted additional
investigation by the USDA's (US Department of Agriculture) Office of
Inspector General. Paul Feeney, with the Office of Inspector General,
had no comment on whether there was or wasn't an ongoing
investigation.
On March 8 [2007], a sample was submitted to ISU's Plant Disease
Clinic. The sample was made up of soybean seeds and pieces of pods,
stems, and a leaf. The sample was reportedly taken from a bin of
soybeans harvested in Mahaska County in 2006. ISU's testing revealed
Asian soybean rust. On March 12 [2007], the USDA lab in Beltsville,
Maryland, confirmed that the single leaf in the sample was infected.
IDA and ISU personnel then collected additional samples from bins at
the location where the sample was allegedly collected. They found no
symptoms or signs of rust, said Greg Tylka, ISU plant pathologist.
Next they extensively collected leaves from the field where the
sample reportedly was harvested and from adjacent fields. Tylka said
a sentinel plot 15 miles (about 24 km) from the farm showed no
evidence of rust. An extensive statewide plant disease survey also
came up empty. "Other than that one leaf, we saw nothing," Tylka said.
The Iowa Soybean Rust Team pointed out in March [2007], that rust
didn't pose a risk for the 2007 growing season. The fungus and spores
that cause the disease can't survive an Iowa winter, said Tylka. As
in previous years, producers need to continue to be vigilant and
monitor conditions that favor rust, Tylka said.

[Asian soybean rust, caused by the fun
gus _Phakopsora pachyrhizi_, is a major soybean disease 1st detected
in Japan in 1902. It can cause premature defoliation, with yield
losses of up to 70 percent reported in farms in Asia. The disease was
discovered for the 1st time in the continental USA in 2004. It has for
some years been active in Asia and Australia, causing periodic
epidemic outbreaks in some regions, and has in recent years spread to
Hawaii and Puerto Rico. Data are lacking concerning its establishment
in Europe but it has been placed on the European [and Mediterranean]
Plant Protection Organization (EPPO) alert list. New strains with
increased virulence are emerging. Kudzu (_Pueraria lobata_), an
introduced weed species, can serve as a pathogen reservoir. _P.
meibomiae_ is a less-virulent related species found in South America
where it also causes soybean rust.
