[Note the different strain reported here, O, from the A24 virus type
recently found in Argentina. Are the 28 bovine cases, clinical cases or
just serological positives? This report further complicates matters in the
southern cone of the Americas. Rio Grande do Sul is a FMD free area of
Brazil and we have 2 virus types circulating in the region. Not good news!
