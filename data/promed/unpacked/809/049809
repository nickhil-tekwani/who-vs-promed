[The previous contagious bovine pleuropneumonia (CBPP) event reported by Namibia to the WOAH was in March 2022. Three outbreaks were reported in the region of Kavango West. See https://wahis.woah.org/#/report-info?reportId=50693.

During the 89th WOAH General Session held in May 2022, Namibia received the OIE endorsement as a country having an official control program for CBPP (https://www.woah.org/app/uploads/2022/05/a-r14-2022-cbppcp-final-1.pdf).

Namibia also has a CBPP free zone recognized by WOAH based on the provisions of Chapter 11.5 of the Terrestrial Code. See map at https://www.woah.org/app/uploads/2021/05/eng-namibia.png.

The current and previous outbreaks in Namibia are located in zones without a recognized CBPP status. - Mod.CRD
