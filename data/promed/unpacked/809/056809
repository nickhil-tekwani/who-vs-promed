CLIMATE CHANGE AND COMMUNICABLE DISEASES
****************************************
A ProMED-mail post
Date: Thurs., 2 October 1997
From: Eurosurveillance Weekly Contents, Oct. 2, 1997

Suspected cases of Lassa fever or other viral haemorrhagic fevers in the
developed world throw clinicians, public health workers, and journalists on
the alert. The possibility that grave, exotic diseases from the tropics
might threaten the life expectancy of those of us who live in temperate
regions seems unthinkable. Yet predictions of global warming reported last
week in the British Medical Journal (1) suggest that our feeling of
security is unjustified and imprudent.
An intergovernmental panel has predicted that the average world temperature
will rise by between 1C and 3.5C in the next 100 years, a faster rate of
change than has been seen in the 10,000 years since agriculture and human
settlement began (1). The resulting disturbances of ecological systems may
influence the incidence and distribution of infectious diseases through
several mediating processes - the range and activity of vectors and
infective parasites, the local ecology of water and foodborne infective
agents, population displacement and damage to infrastructure as a result of
a rising sea level, and other
socioeconomic effects.

Increasing temperatures and rainfall could increase the areas vulnerable to
such vector-borne diseases as malaria and dengue fever, in particular
extending to higher altitudes, as studies making use of natural climate
variability have already shown. About 45% of the world's population now
lives in potentially malarious areas. Mathematical models suggest that the
proportion could rise to 60% in the next 100 years. Risks of tick-borne
viral encephalitis, leishmaniasis, Lyme disease, and cholera might all
extend to wider geographical areas.
An editorial accompanying the paper mentioned above describes the
unsustainable pattern of consumption in the world's rich countries as the
force driving climate change (2). It notes the carbon dioxide emissions
caused by transporting food thousands of miles to fill supermarkets visited
by people who arrive in their carbon dioxide-emitting cars. It calls for
locally-based agriculture, greater emphasis on public transport, cycling,
and walking, and improvements in energy efficiency in homes. Readers are
invited to calculate their own contribution to carbon dioxide production
using a form on the
British Medical Journal's website
