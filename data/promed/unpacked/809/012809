We would like to clarify that the virus characterized by the CDC as West
Nile virus was first isolated at the National Veterinary Services
Laboratories (NVSL) in Ames, Iowa.
The Diagnostic Virology Laboratory of the NVSL isolated virus from
neurological and other tissues of flamingos and tragopans (pheasants) from
the Bronx zoo (specimens were received on 10 Sep 1999) and from crows
(specimens were received on 9 Sep 1999) elsewhere in New York. On 14 Sep
1999 the virus was isolated in embryonated chicken eggs as well as in rabbit
kidney cells. Electron microscopy revealed toga/flavivirus-like viruses, 40
nm in diameter. Additionally, the antigen detection complement-fixation
test was negative for EEE, WEE, and VEE [Eastern, Western & Venezuelan
equine encephalitis viruses.
Also, the isolate did not hemagglutinate goose red blood cells at expected
pH/temperature conditions for the equine encephalitis viruses or the St.
Louis encephalitis virus. CDC personnel were contacted and on 20 Sep 1999
the infective allantoic fluid as well as the infective cell culture fluid
were sent to the CDC laboratory at Fort Collins, CO for further
characterization. On Friday, 24 Sep1999, CDC investigators reported the
identification of the isolates as West Nile virus.

[Flamingoes are African species (West Nile virus country), pheasants are
Asian (Kunjin virus country). We are still waiting to hear whether any of
the affected birds were recently imported - Mod.JW
