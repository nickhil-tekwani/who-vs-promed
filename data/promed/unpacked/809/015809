Man dies from bird flu in Egypt's Menoufiya
-------------------------------------------
30 total deaths from the disease in Egypt since January 2014

A 45-year-old man died of avian flu in Menoufiya in the Nile Delta on Sat [3 Jan 2015], bringing the national death toll from the disease since January last year [2014] to 30.

The death was announced by a health ministry official in Menoufiya, Hanaa Sorour, reported Al-Ahram Arabic website. She said that the man was suffering from pneumonia and was referred to intensive care and placed on a ventilator until he succumbed to the disease.

This is the 2nd fatality caused by bird flu in the governorate over the past year [2014], Sorour said.

The health ministry reiterated its calls for those who handle poultry to seek immediate treatment once flu symptoms start to appear, while advising them to cover their noses and mouths when they deal with any kind of domesticated birds.

In Egypt, most cases of bird flu have been in rural areas, where villagers tend to raise poultry in their homes, increasing exposure to live or dead infected birds.

[2] Egypt (Giza): fatality, H5N1

Egyptian child dies of H5N1 bird flu, 2nd death this year
---------------------------------------------------------
A 3-year-old Egyptian child died from bird flu on Monday [5 Jan 2015], the 2nd death from the virus in the country this year and the 12th in recent months, the health ministry said.

The child was from the Giza governorate, outside Cairo, the ministry said in a statement carried by state news agency MENA [Middle East and North Africa].

Egypt's H5N1 cases have largely been in poor rural areas in the south, where villagers tend to keep and slaughter poultry in the home.

Three other cases are currently being treated, the ministry said.

A total of 668 laboratory-confirmed human cases of H5N1 infection were reported by 16 countries from 2003 to 2 Oct 2014, according to the World Health Organization [WHO]. Of these cases, 393 have died.

The WHO has warned that whenever bird flu viruses are circulating in poultry, there is a risk of sporadic infections or small clusters of human cases, especially in people exposed to infected birds or contaminated environments.

[3] China (Hong Kong): infection control, LPAI H7N9
Date: Mon 5 Jan 2015

A proactive infection prevention plan implemented widely in a Hong Kong healthcare system was a significant factor preventing the spread of influenza strain A H7N9, otherwise known as avian flu. The study was published in the January [2015] issue of Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology, the journal of the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA).

"The emergence of A H7N9 influenza in March 2013 posed a public health threat both locally and internationally because of the risk for airborne transmission," said K.Y. Yuen, MD, FRCPath, a lead author of the study. "Despite the delay in airborne precaution implementation, we suspect that high hand hygiene compliance, as a result of continuous implementation of proactive control measures against various viruses and multidrug-resistant organisms, protected frontline healthcare workers against many challenges of emerging infectious diseases."

Risk for person-to-person transmission in A H7N9 is lower compared to other viruses, including certain influenza strains, but some cases were identified as being spread between relatives. The strain is associated with high mortality and morbidity.

Researchers examined the effectiveness of preparedness measures in controlling the spread of the virus at Queen Mary Hospital in Hong Kong for 13 months (April 2013-May 2014). Infection control staff implemented an integrated approach, utilizing active and enhanced surveillance, early airborne infection isolation, rapid molecular diagnostic testing, and extensive tracing for healthcare workers with unprotected exposure. Additionally, open forum sessions were conducted to brief frontline staff on proper protocols.

During the study period, 126 of 163 456 admitted patients were tested for the strain, and 2 cases tested positive for A H7N9 influenza. 70 healthcare workers had unprotected exposure during patient care activities by not wearing an N95 respirator during aerosol-generating procedures. However, most of the healthcare workers exposed complied with standard precautions, including wearing a surgical mask and performing hand hygiene. No staff tested positive for the strain.

"As we look at lessons learned from this outbreak, the high false-positive screening rate and other delays in diagnosis may have resulted in unprotected exposure of frontline staff. However, enhanced surveillance methods appeared to be an important safety net for the detection of A H7N9," said Yuen.
