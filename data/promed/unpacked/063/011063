Schmallenberg affected nearly all dairy cows
--------------------------------------------
At 92 percent of the tested Dutch dairy farms, almost all cows had to deal with the Schmallenberg virus [SBV].

This is apparent from the results of bulk milk examination carried out by the Animal Health Service (GD) in Deventer. GD cattle veterinarian Linda Wuijckhuise would not specify the exact number of tested farms, but says that it involved a "significant percentage."

The figure of 92 percent is significant, says Wuijckhuise. "It confirms that the virus spread massively and rapidly in 2011 throughout the Netherlands. The majority of the cows have been infected."

To be precise: According to the GD, in 92 percent of the tested dairy farms, at least 50 percent of the dairy cows have been infected with SBV. In most cases, as high as 80 to 100 percent. In 6 percent of the tested farms, the infection rate was 20-50 percent. Only 2 percent of the tested farms had shown infection in less than 20 percent of the dairy cows.

According to the GD, the significant diffusion of the virus is advantageous. Dairy cows, which have undergone infection, are -- most likely -- not susceptible anymore to the SBV and thus will not give birth to malformed calves if exposed to the virus during pregnancy. However, GD has a small reservation. As Wuijckhuise says, "We are not yet in state to absolutely exclude cases, since the virus still remains to be further studied."

Farmers can let their cattle's milk be bulk-tested by the GD until 31 Aug 2012. In mid-September, a 2nd round of bulk-milk test results will become available.

[According to the Dutch media, GD approached 10 000 dairy farmers in early July, offering them a single bulk milk test for SBV antibodies, for the price of 19.5 euro per test. (see http://www.melkvee.nl/nieuws/1957/tankmelkonderzoek-schmallenberg). The results included in the above report are those of the farms which joined early; the remaining results are expected in September.

The results indicate that most Dutch cattle are currently, most likely, immune to SBV -- which reduces or excludes the need to vaccinate them now. Similar situation seems to prevail in Belgium, Germany, Luxembourg, north-western and central parts of France and a part of Spain. In the UK, southern parts of England have undergone infection, while the remaining territory, including Wales and Scotland with their significant ruminant populations, are currently susceptible. A useful map showing the infected (and thus immune) regions in Europe is available on page 2 of DEFRA's "Update No.10 on Schmallenberg Virus in Northern Europe" (updated 25 Jul 2012) at http://tinyurl.com/9axgg5h.

In Switzerland, the virus is currently spreading. The actual situation in other parts of Europe remains to be elucidated.

Further analysis of the Dutch data, and in particular the detailed timetable of 2011/2012 parturitions/abortions of the tested cattle population, may enable evaluation of the potential pathogenicity of SBV to developing bovine embryos in various stages of pregnancy. Definite data may be obtained by animal experimentation.

The EU has allocated 3 million Euro to 7 member-countries for scientific studies on SBV. The studies will be co-financed by the Commission at 50 percent of eligible costs from 1 Apr 2012 - 31 Dec 2013.
