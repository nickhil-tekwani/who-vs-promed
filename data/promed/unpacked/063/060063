Anthrax Still Present In City Home
----------------------------------
Anthrax spores still contaminate a home on Padanaram Road in Danbury,
CT, despite an expensive and complicated attempt to clean them last
week [10-14 Sep 2007]. "We are continuing to see hits in the house,''
David Deegan, spokesman for the Environmental Protection Agency's New
England office, said Thursday [20 Sep 2007]. However, Deegan said a
barn behind the house, where the anthrax contamination was more
severe, appears to be clean.
Because of the continuing contamination at the house, state and
federal health officials will meet today at City Hall to discuss what
steps they need to take next. Deegan said they'll announce their plan
of action after the meeting.
A drum maker brought the anthrax spores to the site in August [2007],
carrying them on goat hides he was using to make drum heads. He and a
family member developed cutaneous anthrax -- anthrax infection under
the skin. When doctors diagnosed the disease this month [September
2007], it triggered a complicated, and expensive clean-up of the site
that closed a quarter-mile section of Padanaram Road for 6 days over
the past 2 weeks. It's unclear whether the next phase of the clean-up
will also involve closing the road.
"Obviously, we'd prefer it to stay open,'' Mayor Mark Boughton said
Thursday [20 Sep 2007]. "But the EPA is calling the shots. We're here
to facilitate their efforts.''

EPA may fumigate Danbury house
----------------------------------
State and federal authorities said Friday they may assemble a tent
around an anthrax-tainted house on Padanaram Road in Danbury, CT,
then pump it full of a gas that could kill the anthrax spores that
remain inside. While there is a 2nd option -- to go back into the
house, wash and vacuum all of its interior and remove its carpets --
they said fumigation is their 1st choice because it would be more
thorough and less destructive. "What we really want to do is take a
whole-house approach," said Dr. James Hadler, chief epidemiologist at
the state Department of Public Health.
Michael Nalipinski, on-site coordinator for the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA), said Friday [28 Sep 2007] there's no
timetable for starting either approach. "There are only a couple of
contractors in the country that do this work," Nalipinski said of the
fumigation. "We don't know what work they're doing now, and when they
could fit this into their schedule. They need to know things like the
size and square footage of the house."
The EPA will pay all the costs of the clean-up. The city is applying
for a USD 25 000 grant from the agency to recover the costs of
policing the site.
A local musician and drum-maker contaminated his car trunk, the barn
behind the house, and the house itself with anthrax spores in August
[2007] when he purchased goat skins in New York City to use for drum
heads. Unbeknownst to him, anthrax spores -- which are like seeds
that can break open into live bacteria -- fouled the skins.
State health officials confirmed earlier this month [September 2007]
that the drum-maker and a family member had contracted cutaneous
anthrax -- an infection that occurs underneath the skin, causing an
oozing, black-scabbed sore. The disease is not contagious and the 2
are taking antibiotics and recovering from their infection. The
discovery of the disease triggered a complex and expensive operation
to test the site for spores and clean it up.
The barn, where the drum-maker stored the skins and fashioned them
into drum heads, was the most contaminated site on the property. "If
you wanted to stick your finger in and get some spore samples, that
was the place," Hadler said. The 4-day cleanup of the site last week
succeeded in ridding the car and barn of spores. But Hadler and
Nalipinski said even while crews were cleaning the house, they took
samples that showed the low-level contamination there was more
widespread than they had thought.
Rather than clean the house again only to find new spots that need
further cleaning, they said fumigation would kill the spores
completely. Hadler said the building poses no risk to anyone because
it's now locked and sealed against public entry. Nor, he said, can
the spores suddenly float away into the ozone -- they're more likely
mixed with dust and remain secure in the carpets in the home. Hadler
said it is likely one of the cutaneous anthrax cases in the family
occurred because of contact with the spores inside the house.
Therefore, he said, it's possible in the future that others living in
the house could become ill as well.
Hadler said it's possible that some activity -- cleaning the carpets,
playing on the floor, doing repair work, or even demolishing the
house -- could stir up those carpet-bound spores, allowing someone to
breathe them in and become seriously ill. "So we have to ask: How
much are we willing to pay to save a life?" Hadler said. "It's
difficult because of the nature of anthrax spores. They can live in
the environment for decades. We don't look at this as a modest job."

Crews to determine contaminants' disposal
-------------------------------------------
People driving by an anthrax-contaminated home on Padanaram Road in
Danbury, CT, may see people working there over the next few weeks.
The good news is people will be driving by.
For the moment, at least, the cleanup of the site will go into a
minor key mode that won't involve routing traffic away from the
house. "The road won't be closed down," Michael Nalipinski, the
on-site coordinator for the federal Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA), said Thursday [27 Sep 2007].
Instead, Nalipinski said, crews will be on the scene on and off over
the next few weeks to do some basic cleanup tasks. They'll take
samples from a barn behind the house to make sure it's free of
anthrax spores. Crews will also be trying to figure out how to best
dispose of the waste materials the previous work generated. That
waste includes used decontamination suits and the chlorine-based
solution used to wash the spores off walls and household objects. All
that material is now stored in barrels at the site.
Nalipinski said Thursday [27 Sep 2007] the EPA and its partners in
the cleanup -- the city and the state Department of Public Health and
Department of Environmental Protection -- still haven't set a time
line for cleaning the spores out of the house on the site. But he
said the EPA's first choice for the work still remains fumigation --
building a big tent around the entire house, then pumping a gas into
it that will kill all the spores.
The house and barn and the trunk of a car became contaminated with
anthrax spores in August [2007] when a musician and African
drum-maker purchased goat skins in New York City to fashion into drum
heads. Unbeknownst to him, the skins, which came from West Africa,
were infected with anthrax spores. Health officials learned of the
situation early in September [2007] when the drum-maker and a family
member came down with cutaneous anthrax -- a form of the disease that
occurs when the spores get under the skin and the bacteria come
alive. That caused a nickel-size, black-scabbed sore to break out on
the man's arm, which doctors diagnosed as anthrax.
As soon at health officials learned of the anthrax contamination
there, the family had to vacate and health officials sealed the home
off from the public. The investigation of the contamination and the
first phase of the cleanup closed a section Padanaram Road for six
days and cost several hundreds of thousands of dollars.

[I delayed posting so that we could have some catch-up as events
occurred. It is a slow process cleaning up such contaminated
buildings, which is what we have seen before as in Florida. An
interesting comment is that this drum maker bought the African goat
skins in New York City. I wonder how many other people have been
exposed from this primary source and what was done to limit
contamination and possible infection damage. Maybe someone in the New
York City Department of Health can elucidate on this. - Mod.MHJ]
