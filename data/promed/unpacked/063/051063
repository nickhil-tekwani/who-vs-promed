'Burger disease' warning issued
-----------------------
The Alberta, Canada government is warning people to turn up the
sizzle as barbecue season heads into high gear and cases of _E. coli_
O157 rise. "We're approaching the prime season. People are cooking
in the open air on their barbecue," Alberta Health spokesman David
Dear said yesterday. "You'll see a rise (in _E. coli_ O157 cases) in
summer months."
The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA), in collaboration with
Alberta Health and Wellness and other provincial agencies, is
currently investigating an increase in cases of _E. coli_ disease,
also sometimes known as "hamburger disease." The bacteria has
affected people in British Columbia, Quebec, possibly Saskatchewan,
and Alberta.
Wild Rose country in Alberta has seen 12 cases linked to the current
CFIA investigation - 2 in the Capital Health region, 8 in the Calgary
Health region, 1 in the David Thompson Health region that covers the
Red Deer area, and 1 in the Chinook Health region that includes
Lethbridge.
Authorities aren't sure yet about the source of the bacteria but know
the cases are linked because of testing. "They suspect ground beef
as the source," said Dear, adding he doesn't know if the spread of
the bacteria has anything to do with tainted meat. "It's too early to
tell."
_E. coli_ O157 bacteria produce a toxin that damages the lining of
the intestine, producing diarrhea and pain and sometimes causing
kidney damage. Most people recover within 2 weeks. In rare cases,
the bacteria can cause death. The bacteria can be found in raw and
undercooked meat, particularly beef.

[Infections due to _E. coli_ O157:H7 are usually directly or
indirectly related to exposure to cattle or beef. Examples of
infections acquired indirectly include from a petting zoo and from
unpasteurized apple juice made from fruit collected in a cow pasture.
Because ground beef is a product of many cows as compared to a steak
from a single animal, the risk of acquisition of infection is
probably significantly higher. It is therefore very important to
emphasize that, in this season of increased outdoor barbecues,
adequate cooking of the hamburger will prevent infection even if the
meat is contaminated. - Mod.LL]
