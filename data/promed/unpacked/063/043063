Suspected Ebola Fever Outbreak in Republic of Congo, Cuvette-Ouest Province
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
BRAZZAVILLE (Republic of Congo): Medical experts were investigating a
possible outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus in the northern jungle of
Republic of Congo amid reports that 5 people had died, officials said
on Tue 11 Jun 2002. The victims, living in the northern village of
Oloba, all had died during the past week, said Stanislas Ebata-Mongo,
head of the government's campaign against Ebola. He said a government
medical team was dispatched on Mon 10 Jun 2002 to Cuvette-Ouest
province to take blood samples from the victims to confirm if they
had died of Ebola fever. World Health Organization (WHO) officials
already inside the country also left for the same area on Monday to
investigate the report.
The last Ebola fever outbreak in the region went from October 2001 to
February 2002, killing 43 people in Republic of Congo and 53 others
in neighboring Gabon, according to WHO. WHO stated that the
[previous] outbreak was sparked after contact with an infected
gorilla. Apes can also contract the virus and die as a result. Monkey
and gorilla meat are frequently consumed by civilians living in
Central Africa. Authorities urged villagers in the area to avoid bush
meat during the last outbreak.
Ebola hemorrhagic fever is one of the world's deadliest viral
diseases, causing death through massive blood loss in up to 90
percent of those infected. [The virus] spreads through bodily fluids
-- though not the air -- and attacks internal organs, causing bloody
diarrhea and vomiting. Within 2 weeks, the victim usually dies from
massive blood loss. WHO says more than 1000 people have died of the
disease since the virus was first identified in 1976 in western Sudan
and in a nearby region of Congo [Zaire].

[The precise location of this suspected new outbreak of Ebola
hemorrhagic fever in Republic of Congo is uncertain, but it appears
to be in the north of the Republic of Congo possibly at some distance
from the earlier outbreak which occurred close to the border with
Gabon. Further information is awaited. - Mod.CP]
