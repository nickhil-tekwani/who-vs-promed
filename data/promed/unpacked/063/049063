Human Rabies-like Disease Due To Duvenhage Virus Infection
-----------------------------------------------
Duvenhage virus infection was confirmed in a 77-year-old man who was
scratched on the face by what appears to have been an insectivorous
bat in February 2006 in North West Province, South Africa. The bat
flew into a room at night, landed on the man's face while he was
attempting to chase it out, and scratched his cheek as he brushed it
off. The bat did not appear to have bitten him, and it escaped after
the incident. The man did not seek medical care, and thus no
post-exposure treatment was given.
He became sick one month later, and died on day 14 of illness. The
diagnosis was confirmed by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain
reactions on saliva and brain tissue followed by sequencing of the
nucleoprotein amplicons. Virus isolation is in progress, and surveys
are to be conducted on bat populations.
Duvenhage virus was 1st discovered in 1970 when a man developed fatal
rabies-like disease after being bitten indoors at night by an
unidentified insectivorous bat about 80 km from the present incident.
The only 2 other isolations of Duvenhage virus were made from bats:
in 1981, it was obtained from a _Miniopterus schreibersi_
insectivorous bat which had been caught in daylight by a cat in
Makhado town (formerly Louis Trichardt) in Limpopo province, about
250 km to the north of the present incident, and in 1986, the virus
was obtained from an insectivorous bat, _Nycteris thebaica_, caught
near a mine shaft across the border from Limpopo province in Zimbabwe.
Since 1981, there have been several isolations of another
rabies-related virus, Lagos bat virus, from fruit bats in
KwaZulu-Natal province of South Africa, but the virus has never been
associated with human disease. There have also been several
isolations of the rabies-related Mokola virus from cats with
rabies-like disease in KwaZulu-Natal and Eastern Cape provinces of
South Africa. Mokola virus is ostensibly associated with shrews and
rodents, not bats, and it was isolated from 2 human patients with
nervous disease in 1969 and 1971, shortly after its initial discovery
in Nigeria in 1968.

[Currently, _Duvenhage virus_ is classified in the "8th Report of the
International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses" as one of 7 virus
species in the genus _Lyssavirus_ of the _Rhabdoviridae_ family of
negative-stranded RNA viruses. Rabies virus is the type species of
the genus _Lyssavirus_. Chiroptera (bats) are known to be vectors for
6 of the 7 species of Lyssavirus, and bats are the exclusive vectors
for 5 of these 6 species. Rabies virus is perhaps exceptional in that
it has in addition many terrestrial vectors, principally carnivores.
Lyssaviruses exhibit broad antigenic cross reactivity at the
nucleocapsids level (e.g. 93 percent between Duvenhage virus and
European bat lyssavirus 1) and cross-neutralization to a lesser
extent. Details of the maintenance cycles for lyssaviruses other than
_Rabies virus_, such as _Duvenhage_, are not known. However, as with
_Rabies virus_, their perpetuation is assumed to involve
bite-transmission, primarily involving chiropteran reservoir host
species, with occasional spillover to other susceptible vertebrates.
Individuals of other species have been sporadically found infected by
these rarely identified lyssaviruses.
This report on Duvenhage virus from the Special Pathogens Unit,
National Institute for Communicable Diseases, Johannesburg, South
Africa adds to knowledge of this elusive virus and records the 2nd
known human fatality following a bat bite. - Mod.CP]
