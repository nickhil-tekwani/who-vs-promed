Very low risk to human health from A/H5N1 avian influenza in Europe
according to ECDC risk assessment
--------------------------------------------------------------------
The direct risk to the health of people in Europe from the avian
influenza detected in Romania and Turkey is very low, according to
experts from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control
(ECDC). The risk is almost entirely confined to people living on
farms with infected poultry or workers involved with culling
(killing) and disposal of infected birds.
There has been considerable confusion in the media about the arrival
of avian influenza A/H5N1 into bird flocks in Europe and the arrival
of pandemic influenza. Not only could this confusion cause
unnecessary anxiety and fear of harmless wild birds, it could
undermine efforts to prepare for a pandemic, as a pandemic may not
occur for several years and may not be caused by H5N1 avian influenza
at all. There are many other candidate human and animal influenza strains.
The ECDC has recently published interim guidance for workers directly
involved in controlling avian influenza (1). The guidance will help
to ensure that all necessary precautions are taken to prevent human
infections among these workers. Protection is based on 6 principles:
(1) Controlling infection in birds
(2) Minimising the number of people possibly exposed to the virus
(3) Proper use of personal protective equipment for those working
with potentially infected animals
(4) Vaccinating the above described workers with seasonal influenza
vaccine, especially if seasonal influenza is circulating, to aid in
correct diagnosis of influenza-like illness and to minimise the
chance of viral reassortment should a person become dually infected.
(5) Careful surveillance for infection among those potentially
exposed, and instant treatment if cases identified
The precautions for the general public in Europe, whether or not they
are in a specific risk group in places where A/H5N1 is known or
suspected to be present, is normal good personal hygiene (hand
washing, especially after contact with birds) and in particular, not
touching birds found sick or dead. It is also recommended that people
follow pre-existing advice to cook eggs and poultry thoroughly to
prevent infection by salmonella and other organisms, as well as the
almost non-existent risk of avian influenza. The advice to travellers
to regions and countries where A/H5N1 is present remains the same as
before. Precautions include avoiding markets where live poultry is
sold, avoiding contact with live poultry, and good personal hygiene.
The full risk assessment, guidance for occupational risk in affected
regions and travel advice is available on the ECDC website at

Low influenza activity in Europe
--------------------------------
Summary: This is the 1st European Influenza Surveillance System
(EISS) bulletin of the 2005-2006 influenza season. The intensity of
clinical influenza activity is low in all parts of Europe. Increasing
activity is reported in England South and Central and the Slovak
Republic, but the incidence of influenza-like illness is still at
baseline levels. Between week 36 and week 41, 3 influenza A cases and
2 influenza B cases have been reported in Great Britain and one
influenza A case in the Czech Republic. No human cases of influenza
A(H5N1) have been reported in Europe.
Epidemiological and virological situation: 19 of the 22 networks that
reported clinical data reported low intensity of clinical influenza
activity, meaning that there is either no influenza activity
detectable or influenza activity is at baseline levels. Except for
England and the Slovak Republic the influenza activity did not change
compared to the previous week. England South and Central and the
Slovak Republic reported an increasing intensity of influenza
activity, whereas England North reported a declining intensity.
In all parts of Europe the geographic spread indicator "no activity"
was reported, meaning that there is no evidence of influenza virus activity.
The total number of respiratory specimens collected by sentinel
physicians in week 41/2005 was 155. In addition, 453 non-sentinel
specimens were analyzed. None of these sentinel and non-sentinel
specimens were positive for influenza virus.
Comment: Based on data reported so far, the current level of clinical
influenza activity in Europe is low (at baseline levels) and since
week 36/2005 there were only sporadic laboratory confirmed influenza
cases reported in Great Britain and the Czech Republic.
Among the respiratory specimens from sentinel and non-sentinel
sources reported to EISS between week 36 and week 41 of 2005
(N=1423), there were 4 laboratory confirmed cases of influenza A and
2 of influenza B. Two of the influenza A cases (week 38, unsubtyped)
and the influenza B cases (week 39) were detected in Wales. The other
influenza A cases were detected in England North and in the Czech
Republic (week 40, unsubtyped).
As the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus A(H5N1) has been
detected in birds in Europe (Romania and Turkey), EISS has started
collection of data on the detection of the A(H5N1) virus in humans as
of 14 Oct 2005. Up to week 41/2005 no human cases have been reported in Europe.
Background: The Weekly Electronic Bulletin presents and comments
influenza activity in 25 European countries (28 networks) that are
members of the European Influenza Surveillance Scheme (EISS). In week
41/2005, 22 networks reported clinical data and 21 networks reported
virological data to EISS. The spread of influenza virus strains and
their epidemiological impact in Europe is being carefully monitored
by EISS in collaboration with the WHO Collaborating Centre in London, UK.

[These reports indicate that there have been no suspected or
confirmed human cases of avian H5N1) influenza throughout Europe up
to week 41 (i.e. up to 16 Oct 2005). Nor are conditions in Eeeuroope
suitable at present for genetic interaction between avian and human
influenza viruses. - Mod.CP]
