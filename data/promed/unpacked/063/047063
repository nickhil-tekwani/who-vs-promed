Authorities in Finland are investigating a _Listeria_ outbreak that has affected 8 people. All patients have been hospitalized, but no deaths have been recorded. The age range of those sick is 60 to 93 years old, 5 are female, and they live in different parts of the country.

Ruska Rimhanen-Finne, a veterinary epidemiologist at the National Institute for Health and Welfare (THL), said all illnesses occurred within a month in May and June [2020].

"At the moment, we have several listeriosis clusters under investigation, but the others are long-term clusters with cases within several years," she told Food Safety News. "We encourage the local authorities to interview the patients as soon and thoroughly as possible by using an online questionnaire that is readable at THL in real-time. We compare the interviews in order to find common exposures. We also encourage the local authorities to go through foods in patients' homes and test risky foods for _Listeria_. The Finnish Food Authority (Ruokavirasto) types _Listeria_ strains from foods that have been tested in April and May [2020] in order to find similar strains as in patients. We also check if we can use patients' purchase information to find common exposures."

The multilocus sequence typing (MLST) 6 cluster is being investigated with the help of whole genome sequencing. The THL is not aware of similar cases in other countries.

Finland has between 40 and 90 listeriosis cases annually. Listeriosis is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium _Listeria monocytogenes_. Symptoms include fever, muscle pain, septicemia (blood poisoning) and meningitis. The incubation period is usually 1 to 2 weeks but can vary between a few and 70 days. The elderly population, pregnant women, newborn infants and people with weak immune systems are more susceptible to infections.

High-risk foods include pre-packed sandwiches, deli and ready-to-eat meat products such as cooked, cured and/or fermented meats and sausages, soft cheeses and cold smoked fishery products.

Between March and May [2020], 4 suspected foodborne outbreaks were reported in the country, compared with an average of 18 in previous years, according to the THL.

The agency believes this is because of the coronavirus pandemic and associated limitations and recommendations. When hands are washed and food prepared for smaller groups, there are fewer epidemics. Suspected pathogens in the 4 outbreaks were _Campylobacter_, _Yersinia_, and norovirus.

[The above news report describes a cluster of 8 listeriosis cases in Finland. The cluster was apparently identified on the basis of multilocus sequence typing of the isolated pathogens. The patients were hospitalized, but none died. The patients lived in different parts of the country.

_Listeria monocytogenes_ is a gram-positive, facultative, intracellular, foodborne pathogen that causes listeriosis, which can be fatal, particularly in elderly populations, pregnant women, and newborns.

Confirmation of a clusters of cases is based on whole genome sequencing (WGS) of the clinical isolates of _L. monocytogenes_, usually from blood, cerebrospinal fluid, tissue from a normally sterile site, or products of conception (such as amniotic fluid, placental, or fetal tissue). The isolates from the 8 patients are now undergoing WGS. A food history from patients in the cluster will then attempt to identify a possible common source. Isolates of _L. monocytogenes_, if found in the suspected food, can then undergo WGS to confirm if the suspected food is the common source.

Food items likely to be contaminated with _Listeria_ include ready-to-eat refrigerated meat products, such as smoked salmon, sushi, and cold-cut meats that do not require further cooking before eating, refrigerated pates or meat spreads, unpasteurized (raw) milk and dairy products, such as soft cheeses, and raw fruits and vegetables (such as sprouts). Even if initial contamination adds only a few _Listeria_ organisms to the food, the contamination can be significant for refrigerated foods because _L. monocytogenes_ can multiply at refrigerator temperatures to a sufficient number to cause disease.

People at increased risk for disseminated listeriosis, which include pregnant women (and their newborns), adults aged 65 years or older, and people with weakened immune systems, should avoid eating food potentially contaminated with _Listeria_.

Finland is an EU country bordered by Sweden to the west, Russia to the east, and Norway to the north (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finland). A map showing the location of Finland can be found at https://www.google.com/maps/place/Finland. - Mod.ML
