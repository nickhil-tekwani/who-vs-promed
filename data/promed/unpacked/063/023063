Police officers in the Venezuelan State of Miranda are continuing to
enforce an order prohibiting use of all beaches in the Higuerote
area, after 468 people were sickened during the past weekend through
[presumed] contamination of the Barlovento coast.
Policemen have been stationed on the roads accessing Caracolito,
Chirimena, Los Totumos, Buche, Puerto Frances, and other beaches
located in the Higuerote area, in order to prevent tourists and
residents from developing the symptoms others reported last weekend.
The same symptoms were reported in the same area in 1996 and 1998.
Physicians at the Higuerote and Caucagua central hospitals cared for
patients presenting with nausea, vomiting, itching, and general
respiratory symptoms. 6 of the people affected had to be sent to a
clinic in the capital in order to obtain proper medical care.
Miranda Fire Chief Jose Antonio Plascencia announced that special
personnel have been sent to the area to care for the affected persons
and that the majority of the victims were treated on an outpatient
basis. He explained that even though both physicians and paramedics
assume that the condition has an environmental origin, all affected
persons claim to have allergic and respiratory symptoms. He recalled
that some time ago the same phenomenon occurred in this area, but the
authorities could not determine its origin. The Fire Chief stated
that no one will be allowed on the beaches in the next 48 hours.
A decree by the State Governor prohibited the use of the affected
areas in order to prevent a recurrence. This decree affects all
beaches, including those located at the Vargas State border.
[In the previous instance,] some physicians put the blame in the
PDVSA [the Venezuelan national oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela]
facility located at Carenero for putting out toxic waste, but this
could not be proven. For this reason, the occurrence was never
explained. Dr. Miguel Mejias, Health Director of Miranda State,
pointed out that some samples had been sent to Coche hospital and
that some other samples are being tested at different epidemiological
centers. They hope to determine the origin of these toxic effects.
He explained that if there is a contaminating agent, it might be a
volatile compound; i.e. something in the air. For this reason, they
believe that the contaminant is not in the beaches themselves.

[Despite the initial indications that this was a case of
contamination caused by oil derivatives from a nearby facility,
neither local nor national sanitary authorities have been able to
determine the nature of the problem. Similar episodes have been
described on at least 2 occasions during the last decade. - Mod.JT]
[Let us hope the appropriate authorities are testing air and water
samples too. - Mod.TG]
