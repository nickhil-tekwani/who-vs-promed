[Although a number of sources have reported decreasing numbers of daily cases, the numbers seem to support the continuing robust number of daily cases. If the epidemic were to continue at the current rate of cases per day, by the end of 2017, there could be 700 000 more cases for a total of 1.12 million cases since the end of April 2017, with 3300 more deaths for a total of about 5500 deaths over that period.
