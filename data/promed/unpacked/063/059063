Preschoolers Sickened by _E. coli_
--------------------------------
The Minnesota Health Department is investigating an _E. coli_ outbreak that
has sickened 14 children from a church preschool and one of their siblings.
Two children remained hospitalized Tuesday, one with a potentially fatal
kidney complication, health officials said.
The source of the outbreak had not been determined, but health officials
were focusing on an apple orchard the preschoolers visited in late
September. The first case of _E. coli_ poisoning was reported 4 days
later, said Dr. Harry Hull, the state epidemiologist.
_E. coli_ causes painful abdominal cramping and severe, bloody diarrhea. Most
infections are linked to eating undercooked, contaminated meat, but _E. coli_
also has been spread through unpasteurized juice and through produce
prepared on countertops contaminated with the bacteria.
The children, from suburban Minneapolis, were given apple cider during a
field trip, but the juice was pasteurized, Hull said. The children are 3
and 4 years old.
Dr. Kirk Smith, a Health Department epidemiologist, said the apples could
have come in contact with a contaminated surface or been washed in water
that contained the bacteria.
