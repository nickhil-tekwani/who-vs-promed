A 140% increase has occurred in 2018 in cases of hepatitis A, in the area that includes the regions of Bio Bio and Nuble, compared to the same date of 2017. In fact, in 2018, 779 cases have been reported, worrying figures for the authorities due to the increase registered since the start of the outbreak of the disease in 2013. According to the health secretary in Bio Bio, Erick Jimenez, the causes could be associated with the consumption of non-potable water, incorrect handwashing, and lack of adequate cooking of seafood.

The communes most affected by hepatitis A are Coronel, where 122 cases were reported, followed by Talcahuano with 94 and Concepción with 78. Despite the figures recorded in the commune of Cuenca del Carbón, epidemiologist Andrea Silva indicated that there will be no focused work in that commune.

As of 9 Sep 2018, a total of 11 940 infants in the area had been vaccinated against hepatitis A.

[The cases are not broken down in regards to age. In children, most cases of HAV infection are subclinical so it is likely that the cases reported were in adults. In the developing world, HAV is not reported much in adults as most children have been infected, and therefore immune to subsequent infection, by the age of 10. That outbreaks are occurring in the area suggests improvement in potable water so less children are infected and therefore still susceptible to HAV as adults. - Mod.LL
