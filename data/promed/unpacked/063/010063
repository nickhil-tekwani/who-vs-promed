A large number of people living in Ayod County, Jonglei State,
Southern Sudan are suffering from severe trachoma, and measures need
to be taken to contain the disease, according to a recent study. "At
least one person with clinical signs of trachoma was found in nearly
every household, and one in 3 households had a person with severe
blinding trachoma," said the findings of the study "The Burden of
Trachoma in Ayod County of Southern Sudan."

A total of 2335 people from 392 households, of whom 1107 were older
than 14, were examined for trachoma by researchers from the Carter
Center and the University of Cambridge.

Trachoma, an eye disease, results from infection with _Chlamydia
trachomatis_ bacteria, which are spread from person-to-person,
especially where there are shortages of water, numerous flies, and
crowded living conditions, according to the UN World Health
Organization (WHO). Poor hygiene practices, such as improper disposal
of solid waste and inadequate face cleaning, contribute to spread of
the disease.

"The prevalence of active trachoma in children one to 9 years of age
reported in this survey is, to our knowledge, the highest
district-wide estimate ever reported in Southern Sudan," noted the
study findings published on 24 Sep 2008. "Trichiasis in children one
to 14 years of age was nearly 30 times the WHO threshold for an
acceptable level of TT (trachomatous trichiasis) cases in adults," it
added. The acceptable threshold is 0.1. Trichiasis refers to a
condition whereby the eyelid turns inwards causing the eyelashes to
rub on the eyeball, resulting in intense pain and scarring of the
front of the eye [and ultimately blindness].

According to the study, up to 1733 children younger than 15 were in
immediate need of eye-lid surgery. "Without surgery, these children
are likely [to] become a burden to their families."

Active trachoma in Ayod was among the highest reported globally. The
study recommended urgent and sustained surgical intervention, the
mass distribution of antibiotics, as well as the adoption of the
practice of face washing and safe disposal of human waste. There was
also a need for increased access to improved water sources [for
face-washing]. Only 4.4 percent of the population in the survey area
had a latrine, while 23.2 percent of individual caregivers reported
never washing their children's faces.

Trachoma often begins during infancy or childhood and can become
chronic and ultimately lead to irreversible blindness, typically
between 30 and 40 years of age if left untreated. It is a leading
cause of preventable blindness worldwide.

[Trachoma is a chronic keratoconjunctivitis caused by recurrent
infections with ocular serotypes of _Chlamydia trachomatis_, an
obligate intracellular bacterium. Infection often begins during
infancy or childhood, and, if left untreated, the infection
eventually causes the eyelid to turn inwards, which in turn causes
the eyelashes to rub on the cornea, resulting in intense pain and
scarring of the cornea. This ultimately leads to blindness by the
time the person is an adult.

Trachoma is widespread in the Middle East, North and Sub-Saharan
Africa, parts of the Indian subcontinent, Southern Asia and China,
with pockets of trachoma in Latin America, Australia (among native
Australians) and the Pacific Islands
<http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/diseases/trachoma/en/>.
The involved regions are characterized by poverty, crowding, poor
personal and family hygiene, lack of safe water, absence of latrines
or toilets, flies, and lack of facial cleanliness.

Trachoma is spread person-to-person among children and within
families by frequent exchange of infected ocular discharge from one
child's face to another, by direct contact with secretions of
affected individuals, by contact with contaminated inanimate objects,
such as towels and/or washcloths, and by flies.

Surgery is done to correct advanced stages of the disease. Facial
cleanliness is emphasized to reduce disease transmission. Improved
access to water and proper disposal of human and animal waste are
reported to decrease the number of trachoma infections in communities
<http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/diseases/trachoma/en/>.
Antibiotics are given to treat active infection, using one percent
tetracycline eye ointment administered to both eyes twice daily for 6
weeks or azithromycin administered as one oral dose (20 mg/kg body
weight). Tetracycline eye ointment is cheap and is almost universally
available, but compliance is often poor, whereas azithromycin is well
tolerated but is relatively expensive, unless donated by Pfizer Inc.
through the International Trachoma Initiative (Mariotti SP. New steps
toward eliminating blinding trachoma. N. Engl. J. Med. 2004; 351: 2004-7).

WHO Guidelines recommend that a district should receive
community-based, mass antibiotic treatment when the prevalence of
active trachoma among one to 9-year-old children is greater than 10
percent, and treatment should be repeated annually for 3 years, after
which, a repeat district survey is carried out. If the district
prevalence in one to 9-year-old children is still 10 percent or
greater, annual mass treatment should be continued. If the prevalence
is less than 10 percent, surveys should be conducted to determine the
prevalence at the community level. Then, in communities in which the
prevalence is less than 5 percent, treatment can be stopped, and in
communities in which the prevalence is 5 percent or greater, annual
treatment should continue until it falls below 5 percent
