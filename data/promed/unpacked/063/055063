The Benin government and a World Health Organization (WHO) official said on [Fri 21 Nov 2014] that 2 people have died in the country from the Ebola-like virus Lassa fever. "After samples were taken and testing, the results came back positive for Lassa fever, which is similar to the Ebola virus but not as virulent," public health minister Dorothee Akoko Kinde-Gazard said.

[The symptoms are similar but the virus is in a different family and the case fatality rate is much lower. Ebola was excluded, see: Ebola virus disease - West Africa (213): Sierra Leone, Benin false alarm, Mali 20141118.2966829. - Mod.JW]

The 2 people were among 5 health workers who died at a hospital in Tanguieta [Atakora department], in the north of the tiny West African nation, which borders Nigeria to the west. "There were 5 deaths at the hospital in Tanguieta but from the samples taken only 2 were positive (for Lassa fever)," she told AFP [Agence France-Presse]. Gazard said that "no other case has yet been brought to our attention". The WHO's representative in the country, Youssouf Gamatie, was quoted as saying in the Benin media: "It's lucky that we have detected it in the initial phase." Benin's authorities said they were expecting additional medication to deal with any further cases.

According to the WHO, Lassa fever is an acute haemorrhagic illness [caused by a virus] which belongs to the arenavirus family of viruses, which also includes the Ebola-like _Marburgvirus_. [This statement about _Marburgvirus_ is incorrect. _Marburgvirus_ belongs to the filovirus family, as does _Ebolavirus_. - Mod.TY]. It was 1st identified in 1969 in the north Nigerian town of the same name.

The virus, which is endemic in rodents in West Africa, is transmitted to humans by contact with food or household items contaminated with the animals' faeces and urine. Person-to-person contact is also possible through bodily fluids, particularly in hospitals when adequate infection control measures are not taken.

People with Lassa fever do not display symptoms in 80 percent of cases but it can cause serious symptoms and death in the remainder.

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that the number of Lassa fever infections in west Africa every year is between
100 000-300 000, with about 5000 deaths.

[Although this is the 1st report of Lassa fever that ProMED-mail has posted for Benin, the occurrence is not surprising. Benin adjoins Nigeria in West Africa. As noted in the 2014 ProMED-mail post on Lassa fever in Nigeria cited below, Lassa fever virus is endemic in Nigeria and is now a serious problem in 23 of the 36 states of that country. It is safe to assume that Lassa fever virus is also endemic in Benin. As Mod.CP pointed out in his comment in archived post 20130131.1524034: "In the countries of Africa, such as Nigeria, where Lassa fever is endemic, the disease is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. While Lassa fever infection is normally mild or has no observable symptoms in about 80 per cent of people infected with the virus, the remaining 20 per cent have a severe, multi-system disease. Exceptionally, Lassa fever is associated with epidemics, during which the case-fatality ratio can reach 50 per cent. There is no preventative vaccine or treatment. The antiviral drug ribavirin has been used with success in Lassa fever patients." Unfortunately, transmission occurs all to frequently in hospitals with inadequate isolation and personal protection for medical staff.

The virus is a member of the family _Arenaviridae_ and causes acute hemorrhagic fever. It is transmitted to humans from contacts with food or household items contaminated with excreta of multimammate rats (_Mastomys_ spp.). Virus transmission can occur in houses or in hospital environments or laboratories in the absence of adequate infection control measures. Because elimination of these rodents is not possible currently, reduction of risk of human infections can be accomplished, but eradication of the virus in these endemic areas cannot.
