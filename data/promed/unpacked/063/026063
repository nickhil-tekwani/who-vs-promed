Pork sales have been banned in the central market of the city after
laboratory tests have shown contamination with trichinella.

The representative of the city's veterinary services has reported
identification of the point of sale of the contaminated pork did not
identify the real source of trichinellosis, since the supply line was
too complicated to track.

While veterinarians are trying to track the source of
trichinella-contaminated pork, a 6th patient has been admitted to the
hospital with trichinellosis. The patients could not recall where they
purchased the possibly contaminated pork.

According to local veterinarians, the epidemiological features of the
trichinellosis cases indicate that the pork contamination is most
likely incidental and not widespread.

[Trichinellosis in pork from pigs raised in backyards and sold on
markets has been described from Latvia before. In our previous report
from 2005 (see below), home slaughtered pigs had been marketed outside
veterinary control.

>From this report, it appears that the infected meat was discovered by
mandatory veterinary control. The present findings show that homegrown
pigs in backyards are still marketed in Latvia, and these pigs are
still at risk of being infected with trichinella.
