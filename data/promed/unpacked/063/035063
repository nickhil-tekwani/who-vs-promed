More than 200 people in 27 US states are being tracked for possible rare monkeypox infections, health officials say.

They fear people may have come in contact with a Texas man who brought the disease in from Nigeria earlier this month [July 2021].

The man -- believed to be the 1st monkeypox case in the US since 2003 -- was taken to hospital but is in stable condition.

So far, no new cases have been found.

What is monkeypox?
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says it is concerned passengers who were on board 2 flights the man made may have been exposed to the disease.

He flew into Atlanta, Georgia from Lagos, Nigeria on [9 Jul 2021], before taking a flight to Dallas, where he was hospitalised, the CDC said.

It said it was working with the airlines to assess "potential risks to those who may have had close contact with the traveller".

But the chances of the disease spreading on the plane were low because passengers had to wear face masks, it added.

A CDC spokesperson told the BBC it was "working with state and local health departments to follow up with individuals who may have been exposed to monkeypox."

"The risk to the general public is thought to be low," the spokesperson said, adding that none of the 200 people they were monitoring were thought to be "high risk."

Monkeypox is a rare viral disease from the same family as smallpox but is much less severe.

It occurs mostly in remote parts of central and west African countries, near tropical rainforests.

Though rare, the disease has occurred in the US before. A 2003 outbreak caused 47 confirmed or probable cases and was linked to [West African] rodents flown into the country.

[The report above is of interest because it illustrates how rapid contact tracing and follow-up contact surveillance are done. It is also a good example of the importance of mask wearing when individuals are in closed spaces for long periods of time. Although air quality in commercial aircraft is excellent, with filtered airflow and frequent changes, the risk of aerosol transmission, although very small, is not zero.

As noted in the previous post, the question remains about the source of these recent infections and the index case above. Monkeys are not the reservoirs of the virus, despite the name that the virus has received. Studies of prevalence of monkeypox (MPX) virus in populations of rodent hosts are not mentioned in this or in previous reports. The main reservoirs of MPX virus are suspected to be rodents, including rope squirrels (_Funisciurus_ spp., an arboreal rodent) and terrestrial rodents in the genera _Cricetomys_ and _Graphiurus_. Halting the bushmeat trade and consumption of wild animals to halt MPX virus exposure will be culturally and economically difficult, so continued occurrence of cases can be expected. Even if a vaccine were available for use in Africa, deciding where to mount a campaign in this extensive geographic area where the virus occurs would be a challenge.
