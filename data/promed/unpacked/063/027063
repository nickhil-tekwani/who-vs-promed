Dutch Ban Poultry Exports; Suspect Flu
-------------------------------------------------------------
AMSTERDAM:The Dutch government banned all exports of poultry and related
farm products Saturday after a suspected outbreak of bird flu on 6 Dutch farms.

The Agriculture Ministry ordered farmers to keep chickens and other birds
inside and prohibited the transport or sale of eggs, poultry or animal feed.

The infections are believed to be in the villages Scherpenzeel, Renswoude
and Barneveld in the eastern province of Gelderland, near the German border.

Avian influenza generally infects only birds, but there have been isolated
cases when humans contracted the disease. The most recent was in Hong Kong
last month when a boy and his father became sick after having been in
direct contact with sick birds.

To prevent infections from spreading in the Netherlands, roads were closed
for a radius of 6 miles around all suspect farms, according to an
Agriculture Ministry statement.

The Netherlands, which suffered several severe outbreaks of swine fever in
recent years, is a main exporter of chickens and eggs in Europe. The
association for poultry and eggs farmers said a long-term ban would cost
the industry tens of thousands of dollars a week.

[In case the current outbreak is found to be caused by the Highly
Patghogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) virus, this news might become very
alarming. Details on the identification of the involved virus are expected
soon. Low Pathogenic Avian Influenza (LPAI) virus has been evolving in
Northern Italy for some time (see ref).
