Egypt: avian influenza situation - WHO update 2
-----------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health and Population, Egypt, has announced 2 new
cases of human infection of H5N1 avian influenza.
The 1st case is a 25-year-old female from Dekerns District, Dakahlyah
Governorate. She developed symptoms on 26 Dec 2007, was hospitalized
on 27 Dec 2007, and died on 30 Dec 2007.
The 2nd case is a 36-year-old female from Menof District, Menofia
Governorate. She developed symptoms on 26 Dec 2007 was hospitalized
on 29 Dec 2007, and died on 31 Dec 2007. To date, there has been no
evidence of an epidemiological link between this case and the
previous case from Menofia Governorate announced on 28 Dec 2007.
Both women had contact with sick and dead poultry prior to illness
onset. Of the 43 cases confirmed to date in Egypt, 18 have been fatal.

[As of 31 Dec 2007 the Egyptian Ministry of Health and Population
reported 4 deaths during the previous 7 days, bringing the total
number of cases to 44 and the number of fatalities to 19. At the
moment it is difficult to resolve the discrepancy between this
situation and the WHO statement by identities from the limited
information provided. Clarification is awaited. - Mod.CP]

[2] Viet Nam: wild bird origin suspected
Date: Thu 3 Jan 2008

The 4-year-old child from Viet Nam's northern Son La province, who
died in mid-December 2007 from bird flu, might have been infected
with bird flu virus strain H5N1 from wild birds, according to local
newspaper Youth on Thursday [3 Jan 2008].
All specimens from poultry in the province have tested negative for
H5N1, so the child might have contracted the virus from infected wild
birds hunted and brought home by his family members, the newspaper
quoted an official from Viet Nam's Department of Animal Health, Van
Dang Ky, as saying.
After detecting no human cases of bird flu infections for nearly 4
months, Viet Nam's Health Ministry in late December 2007 confirmed
that the boy from Moc Chau district died from bird flu. The boy died
on 16 Dec 2007 after being admitted to the National Hospital of
Pediatrics in Hanoi, [the] capital, on 14 Dec 2007. He was treated at a
hospital in the district on 12 Dec 2007 after showing signs of fever
and pneumonia.
Viet Nam has reported a total of 101 human cases of bird flu
infections, including 47 fatalities, since the disease started to hit
the country in December 2003.

[It is not unreasonable to assume in the absence of demonstrable H5N1
virus infection in domestic poultry that infection could have been
introduced into the household via the carcasses of wild birds.
However the evidence is no more than circumstantial as there has been
no confirmation (in this case or any other case to my knowledge) that
H5N1 virus has been contracted by humans from wild birds, dead or
alive. Furthermore it has not been confirmed that the wild birds
involved actually carried the virus. If transmission had occurred it
would imply that the young child was genetically susceptible to
infection whereas the family members who hunted and exhibited no
illness were not. - Mod.CP]
