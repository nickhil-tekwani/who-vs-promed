The latest round of tests from the Wyoming Game and Fish Department's (WGFD) chronic wasting disease (CWD) surveillance program has found the disease in 3 new hunt areas, including a hunt area near Cody.

WGFD staff at the wildlife disease laboratory in Laramie confirmed the presence of CWD in a white-tailed buck from deer hunt area 112 southwest of Cody, in a bull elk from elk hunt area 12 northeast of Saratoga, and in a white-tailed doe in deer hunt area 171 north of Lander. Consistent with previous CWD findings for the season, these hunt areas are all near or overlap areas where CWD has been detected before.

"We continue to work hard to monitor CWD, research its impacts and potential vaccines," said Scott Edberg Deputy Chief of Game and Fish's Wildlife Division. "By the end of the year [2015], we will be releasing a draft updated CWD management plan for public review and comment. We look forward to hearing from the public about this proposed plan."

Hunters who wish to have their deer, elk, or moose tested for CWD outside of the department's CWD surveillance program can to do so by contacting the Wyoming State Veterinary Lab at (307) 766-9925. Hunters should be aware that it may take a few weeks after their animal is sampled to get their test results.

[For a map of Wyoming go to http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/united_states/wyoming_90.jpg Big Horn County is on the north-west upper border of with Montana. For Cody, a newly designated area, go to http://www.fallingrain.com/world/US/WY/Cody.html. For Lander http://www.fallingrain.com/world/US/WY/Lander.html and for Saratoga http://www.fallingrain.com/world/US/WY/Saratoga.html.

For a map of CWD in North America, correct as of October 2015, go to http://www.nwhc.usgs.gov/disease_information/chronic_wasting_disease/; to enlarge the map, click on it. It is now clear that CWD exists across the whole northern border of Wyoming with Montana and presents a very real risk to the cervid game in the latter state. Hunters enjoying the present deer season need to be fully aware of this possibility.

If this cervid disease can move west, it can move north. So deer hunters on Montana-Wyoming border need to be on the lookout for possible affected deer, and make sure that any possibly affected deer get sampled. - Mod.MHJ
