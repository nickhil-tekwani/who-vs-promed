Three cases of jungle yellow fever were diagnosed at the Instituto Evandro
Chagas (IEC), Belem, Para, Brazil in the Arbovirus Department. The cases
come from Marajo Island, in Para State, in the delta of the Amazon River,
from the municipalities of Breves (two cases) and Afua (one case). All
patients were male and recovered uneventfully.
These were the first cases of YF diagnosed this year in Brazil.
Last year, in March 1998, 10 cases were diagnosed from Afua, from the
Morcego River (0º 06'S; 50º 20'W), near the area where the present cases
were reported.
An eco-epidemiological investigation is being done.

[Jungle yellow fever is transmitted from monkeys to humans by forest
mosquitoes. The locations where the cases occurred are not much visited by
tourists, but if cases are being hospitalized in major towns, there is a
risk of spread within the town by the yellow fever mosquito, _Aedes
aegypti_.
I have a special interest in this report. I directed the IEC arbovirus lab
for more than 5 years in the late 1960s, while it was still supported by
The Rockefeller Foundation. Since then it has gone from strength to
strength under Brazilian directorship. It acquired an e-mail connection
this week, and one of its first acts has been to file this report. Muitos
parabens (many congratulations), Pedro, e um grande abraço - Jack - aka
