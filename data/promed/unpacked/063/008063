A disease last seen in Durban [KwaZulu-Natal province] 26 years ago has killed a child and has 2 others critically ill, with doctors fighting to save them with antimicrobials. A health official said 3 more children were "strongly suspected" of being infected with diphtheria, a contagious bacterial disease.

"One was admitted to hospital this past weekend [25-26 Apr 2015]. This patient and another were being treated in a public hospital. The 3rd case is in a private hospital. We say suspected because although there has been a clinical diagnosis, lab tests are yet to confirm it," he said. The disease is preventable through vaccination, but requires booster shots.

The National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) said that the 8-year-old boy who died was transferred from Prince Mshiyeni Hospital to Inkosi Albert Luthuli Central Hospital after running a fever for 3 days. He had massively swollen tonsils and a "bull neck" which made it difficult for him to breathe. An emergency tracheotomy had to be performed. In spite of some initial improvement with antimicrobial treatment in intensive care, he "developed unexpected complications and died," the NICD said.

University of KwaZulu-Natal clinical microbiology lecturer, Dr Yacoob Coovadia, said diphtheria could damage the heart, nerves, or kidneys within 10 to 14 days. "So even if the child initially survives because of proper care, they can still die from the damage caused to the body." He said because the disease was so uncommon, South Africa, as well as many other countries, did not keep the antitoxin which neutralizes the toxin released by the diphtheria bacteria. "It is only stocked in India and Israel, and by the time the procedure to import it is complete, it may be too late because the antitoxin only works if administered early," Coovadia said.

Diphtheria could only be eradicated through a successful immunization program, he said. "Children are vaccinated at 6, 10, and 14 weeks and booster doses at 18 months, 6, and 12 years old." The NICD said the mother of the boy who died confirmed her son had not received the 2nd booster vaccine 2 years ago. It was also discovered that this was the case with the 2nd child, also 8 years of age. The 3rd, a 9-year-old, had not received booster doses either. 2 of the children are from the same section in uMlazi, and the other child is from Chatsworth, and is being treated at RK Khan Hospital.

After the outbreak, the Department of Health conducted a "catch-up" vaccination campaign in the area and schools. In a statement issued during the observation of Child Health Week earlier this month [April 2015], Health MEC [Member of the Executive Council] Dr Sibongiseni Dhlomo said his department was "determined to accelerate child health services drastically to save more children's lives."

The following was extracted from http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/dip.pdf:

Diphtheria is an acute, toxin-mediated disease caused by the bacterium _Corynebacterium diphtheriae_. The name of the disease is derived from the Greek 'diphthera', meaning leather hide. The disease was described in the 5th century BCE by Hippocrates, and epidemics were described in the 6th century AD by Aetius. The bacterium was first observed in diphtheritic membranes by Klebs in 1883 and cultivated by Loeffler in 1884. Antitoxin was invented in the late 19th century, and toxoid was developed in the 1920s.

_C. diphtheriae_ is an aerobic Gram positive bacillus. Toxin production (toxigenicity) occurs only when the bacillus is itself infected (lysogenized) by a specific virus (bacteriophage) carrying the genetic information for the toxin (tox gene). Only toxigenic strains can cause severe disease. Culture of the organism requires selective media containing tellurite. If isolated, the organism must be distinguished in the laboratory from other _Corynebacterium_ species that normally inhabit the nasopharynx and skin (such as diphtheroids). _C. diphtheriae_ has 3 biotypes -- gravis, intermedius, and mitis. The most severe disease is associated with the gravis biotype, but any strain may produce toxin. All isolates of _C. diphtheriae_ should be tested by the laboratory for toxigenicity.

Susceptible persons may acquire toxigenic diphtheria bacilli in the nasopharynx. The organism produces a toxin that inhibits cellular protein synthesis and is responsible for local tissue destruction and membrane formation. The toxin produced at the site of the membrane is absorbed into the bloodstream and then distributed to the tissues of the body. The toxin is responsible for the major complications of myocarditis and neuritis and can also cause low platelet counts (thrombocytopenia) and protein in the urine (proteinuria). Clinical disease associated with non-toxin-producing strains is generally milder. While rare severe cases have been reported, these may actually have been caused by toxigenic strains that were not detected because of inadequate culture sampling.

The incubation period of diphtheria is 2-5 days (range, 1-10 days). Disease can involve almost any mucous membrane. For clinical purposes, it is convenient to classify diphtheria into a number of manifestations, depending on the site of disease. The most common sites of diphtheria infection are the pharynx and the tonsils. Infection at these sites is usually associated with substantial systemic absorption of toxin. The onset of pharyngitis is insidious. Early symptoms include malaise, sore throat, anorexia, and low-grade fever. Within 2-3 days, a bluish-white membrane forms and extends, varying in size from covering a small patch on the tonsils to covering most of the soft palate. Often by the time a physician is contacted, the membrane is greyish-green, or black if bleeding has occurred. There is a minimal amount of mucosal erythema surrounding the membrane. The membrane is adherent to the tissue, and forcible attempts to remove it cause bleeding. Extensive membrane formation may result in respiratory obstruction.

The patient may recover at this point; or if enough toxin is absorbed, develop severe prostration, striking pallor, rapid pulse, stupor, and coma, and may even die within 6 to 10 days. Fever is usually not high, even though the patient may appear quite toxic. Patients with severe disease may develop marked edema of the submandibular areas and the anterior neck along with lymphadenopathy, giving a characteristic "bull neck" appearance.

Most complications of diphtheria, including death, are attributable to effects of the toxin. The severity of the disease and complications are generally related to the extent of local disease. The toxin, when absorbed, affects organs and tissues distant from the site of invasion. The most frequent complications of diphtheria are myocarditis and neuritis. Myocarditis may present as abnormal cardiac rhythms and can occur early in the course of the illness or weeks later, and can lead to heart failure. If myocarditis occurs early, it is often fatal. Neuritis most often affects motor nerves and usually resolves completely. Paralysis of the soft palate is most frequent during the 3rd week of illness. Paralysis of eye muscles, limbs, and diaphragm can occur after the 5th week. Secondary pneumonia and respiratory failure may result from diaphragmatic paralysis. Other complications include otitis media and respiratory insufficiency due to airway obstruction, especially in infants. - Mod.LL]
