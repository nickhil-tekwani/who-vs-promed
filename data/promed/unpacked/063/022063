The Ministry of Health and Social Services in Namibia has reported a suspected anthrax outbreak in Opuwo District, Kunene Region, located in the far north-west part of the country.

The outbreak was originally recognized in late October 2018 when 4 patients presented at the district hospital with wounds (skin lesions) and swelling on various parts of their bodies. It was established that these case-patients had either handled carcasses of dead goats or consumed the meat.

As of 21 Nov 2018, a total of 52 suspected cases of anthrax were reported, manifesting either as the cutaneous or the gastrointestinal form of the disease.

About 138 community members reportedly consumed meat from dead goats and/or handled the carcasses and were administered antibiotic prophylaxis. The veterinary division of the Ministry of Agriculture, Water and Forestry earlier reported that a total of 98 goats, donkeys, and cattle died of an unknown cause in the Sesfontein settlement since August 2018.

On 1 Nov 2018, the _Bacillus anthracis_ bacterium was isolated from a specimen collected from a dead goat in Sesfontein settlement. Officials say the likelihood of more human cases is high, given the outbreak in goats (their animal of choice) and the common risk practices such as slaughtering sick animals and/or skinning and consuming meat from animals that have died of unknown causes.

An anthrax outbreak in the African country of Namibia has struck at least 52 people who have handled or eaten dead goats.

The World Health Organization warned that "the likelihood of more human cases is high" because people in the region have so much contact with potentially sick animals. At least 52 people are reported to have been infected with anthrax in the Opuwo region in the north-west of Namibia. People are thought to have caught the infection from goats, cattle and donkeys that picked it up while grazing; anthrax spores can remain in the soil for years.

In the Opuwo District of Namibia, where the current outbreak is taking place, most people work as goat farmers, and 98 animals have died of unknown causes. The goats, donkeys and cows that have died mysteriously since August 2018 are believed to be responsible for transmitting the infection to people.

No people are known to have died in the current outbreak, but 138 people have been given antibiotics after coming into contact with dead goats. The disease can kill within a couple of days if caught by eating meat, but around 75 per cent of people survive cases transmitted to the skin, which respond well to antibiotics.

Officials say the current outbreak, taking place in the far north-west of the country, began in an 11-year-old boy in October 2018, and early cases have affected people's skin.

The WHO added: "A collective cross-border approach with Angola is needed to control the event and prevent further infections."

[Both reports seem to have originated in a WHO news release, and both have useful maps. The previous report had 44 people on prophylactic antibiotics. The number is now 138 and probably reflects additional village communities presently at risk; Opuwo District is mentioned. Previously, it was reported in Omiriu and Okamba yOzongombo in Kunene. - Mod.MHJ
