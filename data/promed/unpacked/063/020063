The New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets confirmed equine herpesvirus in 3 horses in 2 counties, according to the Equine Disease Communications Center.

A Paint mare from Erie County that exhibited ataxia and falling was confirmed positive for EHV-1 via nasal swab PCR test the week ending 11 Jan 2019.

The mare and all other horses on the farm are quarantined. Biosecurity measures and temperature monitoring are in place. No horses have left the farm in the 2 weeks preceding the onset of the illness nor have any left the farm after the diagnosis of this case. The mare had not traveled off of the farm recently.

In Schuyler County, the state reported one equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy (EHM) case and one positive test for EHV-1 at the same quarantined premises.

An aged quarter horse mare displaying leaning and hind-end ataxia was confirmed positive the week ending 4 Jan 2019. A few days later, a quarter horse gelding on the farm with only a high fever also tested PCR positive on a nasal swab for EHV-1.

The mare, gelding, and all other horses on the farm are quarantined. No horses have left the farm in the 2 weeks preceding the onset of the illness nor have any left the farm after the diagnosis of the index case.

New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets will continue to monitor the situation.

["Equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy (EHM) is another name for the neurologic disease associated with equine herpesvirus (EHV) infections. Neurological signs appear as a result of damage to blood vessels in the brain and spinal cord associated with EHV infection. Interference with the blood supply leads to tissue damage and a subsequent loss in normal function of areas in the brain and spinal cord.

To date, 9 EHVs have been identified world-wide. Three of these -- EHV-1, EHV-3, and EHV-4 -- pose the most serious health risks for domesticated horses and can have significant economic impacts on the U.S. equine industry.

EHV-1 can cause 4 manifestations of disease in horses, including a neurological form, respiratory disease, abortion, and neonatal death. EHM is most often due to mutant or neuropathogenic strains of EHV-1, so called because of a particular mutation in the genome.

EHV-3 causes a venereal disease called equine coital exanthema that affects the external genitalia.

EHV-4 causes a nonfatal upper-respiratory-tract disease in foals and is uncommonly associated with abortion and rarely with neurologic disease.

By 2 years of age, almost all horses have been infected with EHV-1. The initial exposure generally occurs in foals from contact with their dams. The virus can then become latent, or inactive, in the horse's body, setting up a carrier state that is lifelong. Horses of any age that are carriers of EHV-1 do not show any external signs of disease when the virus is in a latent form. The virus can be reactivated during times of stress, such as strenuous exercise, long-distance transport, or at weaning.

EHV-1 is the primary cause of EHM. In recent years, there has been a marked increase in the number of EHV-1 cases, especially EHM, reported in the USA. There have also been several outbreaks of EHM at large horse facilities and events, including at racetracks, horse showgrounds, veterinary clinics, and boarding stables. The large number of horses that can be exposed on such premises and the serious nature of the disease have caused significant concern within the animal health community and the U.S. horse industry.

Furthermore, these recent occurrences of EHM appear to meet the criteria of an emerging disease. A disease is considered to be "emerging" when it satisfies at least one of 3 criteria:

- The disease is identified for the 1st time in a region or country;
- A disease changes in severity, type of animal that can be infected, or pathogen behavior; or
- There is a change in geographic range of a disease or in its incidence within a range.

EHM likely meets the 2nd criterion of an emerging disease, as the recent EHV-1 outbreaks seem to be associated with a change in the severity and behavior of the virus. It is possible that the reporting of EHV-1 cases has increased, rather than an actual increase in the number and severity of cases; however, more data are needed to make such a distinction. [ProMED-mail has certainly reported a lot of these. - Mod.TG]

The most common way for EHV-1 to spread is by direct, horse-to-horse contact. This virus is shed from infected horses via the respiratory tract or through direct or indirect contact with an infected aborted fetus and fetal membranes.

Horses may appear to be perfectly healthy yet spread the virus via the secretions from their nostrils. It is important to realize that EHV-1 can also be spread indirectly through contact with physical objects contaminated with infectious virus. Examples of such objects include

- Tack,
- Wipe rags or other grooming equipment,
- Feed and water buckets, and
- People's hands or clothing.

The air around a horse that is shedding the virus can also be contaminated with infectious virus. Although we know that the virus can become airborne, it is difficult to establish the distance the virus can spread in this manner under typical horse management and environmental conditions.

The standard form of care for EHM is primarily supportive. Treatments may include intravenous fluids or anti-inflammatory drugs. Antibiotics may be used to treat a secondary bacterial infection if one develops; however, antibiotics have no effect on the equine herpesvirus itself. Antiviral drugs have also been used to treat EHM cases. Research on the efficacy of these drugs, their cost effectiveness, and the optimal dosing regimen for EHM is still underway.

There are many steps you can take to help prevent the spread of EHV-1:

- Stop horse movement if your animals may be infected with EHV-1. This is the most important 1st step horse owners can take. Horses should neither enter nor leave a premise where EHM has been diagnosed until cleared by the veterinarian.

- Do not allow horses exposed to an EHM case to have contact with unexposed horses on the premises.

- Isolate sick horses. Horses that have aborted or shown signs of fever, respiratory disease, or neurologic disease should be separated from healthy horses. Ideally, the sick horse(s) should be moved into a separate building or paddock on the premises or be transported to a veterinary hospital with an isolation facility.

- Do not share equipment among horses on the facility. Since this virus can be spread from horse to horse via contaminated objects such as water/feed buckets or bridles, equipment should not be shared among horses.

- Practice proper biosecurity measures to prevent people from spreading the virus. Since people can transfer this virus from horse to horse via hands and clothing, personnel should wash their hands after handling one horse and before handling another. They should also change their clothes and footwear after working with a sick horse. Optimally, a person who takes care of a sick horse should not work with healthy horses. When this is not practical, healthy horses should be handled 1st and sick horses last. Wearing gloves and using disinfectant to sanitize footwear can also help minimize the risk of people spreading the virus between animals.

Vaccines exist to control the respiratory and abortion manifestations of EHV-1; however, the currently licensed vaccines are not labeled for the prevention of EHM. University and private researchers are looking into several existing vaccines to determine if they protect against EHM. New vaccines for EHM are also being studied."

It is very helpful to refresh ourselves on the definitions and precautions associated with this disease at the beginning of the year. The last paragraph from USDA is interesting. I know it takes a while for vaccines to be developed, tested, licensed, and marketed. However, aside from this last paragraph, I have not heard or seen any evidence of these vaccine developments. Nor have I heard or read of any granting opportunities or company press releases related to vaccines against this disease. ProMED-mail would welcome some news on vaccines against this disease. - Mod.TG
