Agriculture severely threatened by HLB
--------------------------------------
Huanglongbing [HLB] was identified in 2 municipalities of La Guajira [department]. If it spreads, it could cause the loss of some 83 000 hectares [about 205 000 acres] of citrus fruits.

The disease could cause the end of Colombia's citrus industry at any time, according to the national federation of growers, who also said that they have been waiting 2 years for the Government to provide the necessary devices to monitor and prevent the spread of the vector that transmits the disease.

[Huanglongbing (HLB, also called citrus greening), is one of the most damaging diseases of citrus crops affecting leaves and fruits. It is caused by fastidious phloem-inhabiting bacteria classified as _Candidatus_ Liberibacter asiaticus, africanus (including a subsp. capensis) or americanus.

The disease affects both leaves and fruits. Symptoms include blotchy mottling and yellowing of leaves and small, irregularly shaped fruits with a thick, pale peel, and bad taste. Early symptoms may be confused with nutrient deficiencies. Affected trees become stunted, bear multiple off-season flowers, and may live for only a few years without ever bearing usable fruit.

HLB is restricted to _Citrus_ and close relatives because of the narrow host range of its psyllid vectors. _Ca._ L. asiaticus and americanus are spread by the Asian citrus psyllid (_Diaphorina citri_). The main vector for _Ca._ L. africanus is the African citrus psyllid _Trioza erytreae_. The pathogens can also be spread by grafting and possibly by seed from infected plants or transovarially in the vectors. Both pathogens and vectors can be spread with plant material.

Disease management requires an integrated approach including use of clean planting and grafting stock, elimination of inoculum, use of pesticides for vector control in orchards, and biological control of vectors in non-crop reservoirs. Control using cultural methods, such as interplanting of guava, is being trialled (ProMED-mail post 20070912.3018). In areas where an HLB pathogen has not yet been detected, biological control of vectors has been used successfully to reduce insect numbers and, therefore, the risk of HLB outbreaks (for example, see ProMED-mail post 20090601.2034).

Both _Ca._ L. asiaticus and _Ca._ L. americanus are spreading in South America. _Ca._ L. asiaticus appears to increase at a disproportionally higher rate which is thought to be due to this species being more heat tolerant, but mixed infections have also been detected. It is not clear which of the pathogens is referred to above, but if _Ca._ L. asiaticus has been detected, this may be its first report in the country.
