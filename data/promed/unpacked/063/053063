A Sonoma County [California] woman's horse and dog were killed, and another horse she owns was sickened, after the animals ingested cookies laced with poison that apparently were deliberately left for them to eat earlier this month, officials said Tuesday [23 Feb 2016].

Deputies recently identified a person of interest in the poisoning case, but authorities would not give details about the possible suspect, said Sgt. Cecile Focha, a spokeswoman for the Sonoma County Sheriff's Office.

The animals became ill on 12 Feb 2016 after someone planted the homemade cookies laced with oleander toxicity on the woman's property in an unincorporated area of Sebastopol along Kennedy Road.

One of the horses and the dog ultimately died, and necropsies revealed they had been slipped the poisonous plant.

Oleander is an outdoor shrub with delicate flowers found in warm climates. The plant is poisonous to horses, dogs cats, cows and birds and other animals and causes vomiting, seizures, heart failure and often death.

Deputies said the case appears to be an isolated incident and authorities have warned neighbors near where the poisoning occurred.

Anyone with information about the poisoning can call the Sonoma County Sheriff's Office at (707) 565-2185.

[Oleander (_Nerium oleander_) is a beautiful plant with dark green slender leaves and delicate blossoms, generally a bright pink or red, or white. The veins of the leaves are very prominent and can be used for microscopic identification in the stomach contents. All parts of the plant are regarded as toxic. The plant maintains its toxicity even in the dry or dormant state. Branches or leaves that have been cut off and dried or dried because of a frost, are just as toxic as the green leaves.

Oleanders typically grow in warm climates, along the southern coast of the USA, up portions of the western seaboard and the eastern seaboard and many places in the South.

Oleander contains the cardioactive glycosides oleandrin and neriine, and possibly cardenolides and bufodienolides as well. These latter 2 interfere with the electrolyte balance within the heart muscle. Most often the animals die, or those that survive may have permanent cardiac damage. Oleandrin may be another toxin involved. But it takes extremely small bits of any of these toxic principles to produce death.

All parts of the plant are toxic, but these cardioactive glycosides are considered to be highest in the sap. It is extremely toxic and is reported to be bitter. Hungry animals will consume almost anything.

This is a sad and painful way for animals to die. It is even worse to think that a child could have consumed these 'treats' mistakenly.
