The 1st confirmed Colorado case of hantavirus in 2019 has recently been reported, according to Northeast Colorado Health Department Public Information Officer Alicea Einspahr.

Einspahr said in a press release this serves as a good reminder that the virus is found throughout the state, including in Northeast Colorado.

Human cases infrequently occur however, the illness is severe and potentially life-threatening if not identified early.

Hantavirus is a respiratory disease carried by mice and rats. The rodents shed the virus in their urine, droppings, and saliva.

In Colorado, the virus is mainly transmitted to people when they breathe in air or dust contaminated with deer mouse urine and feces, especially when cleaning out rodent-infested structures in and around their residences.

Not all rodents carry hantavirus[es], and there is usually no way to tell when a rodent has the virus. So, it is wise to avoid all contact with rodents when possible.

There are no known cases of hantavirus[es] being transmitted person-to-person in the United States.

Symptoms of hantavirus [infection], which can begin from 1-6 weeks after exposure, include fever, body aches, headache, and vomiting.

While at first there are no respiratory symptoms, the illness can progress quickly to respiratory distress within 1-5 days. People may have a dry cough and difficulty breathing caused by their lungs filling with fluid.

Because no effective treatment exists for hantavirus infections, prevention is key and includes the following:
- ventilate structures before cleaning and spray any accumulation of dust, dirt and mouse droppings with a mixture of bleach and water (one part bleach to nine parts water);
- never sweep or vacuum an area where a rodent infestation has been, this can make virus particles airborne;
- rodent-proof your buildings by plugging holes or other mouse entry ways. Conduct year-round rodent control or hire a professional exterminator;
- keep indoor areas clean, especially kitchens. Dispose of garbage in sealed containers;
- remove rodent hiding places near your home, such as wood, junk and brush piles. Store firewood at least 100 feet [30 m] from your house. Keep vegetation around the house well-trimmed.

[This is the 1st case of a hantavirus infection in Colorado this year (2019) but ProMED-mail posted 3 Colorado cases last year (2018). The circumstances under which the case above contracted the infection was not indicated but probably involved an area where mouse droppings indicated that the rodent reservoir of the virus was present. The hantavirus involved in this, and other cases in the western USA, is Sin Nombre virus. Fatalities are due to hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HPS). HPS can be very serious and progress swiftly, so patients developing the symptoms should seek medical attention at the earliest possible time.

Infected rodents shed the virus in feces, urine, and saliva. Individuals opening up cabins or storage areas that have been closed over winter or cleaning areas with signs of rodent presence should heed the precautions indicated above and those that the CDC recommends in order to avoid exposure to the virus (https://www.cdc.gov/rodents/cleaning/index.html).

Deer mice, _Peromyscus maniculatus_, are the reservoir hosts of the virus. An image can be seen at http://www.nsf.gov/news/mmg/media/images/mouse_f.jpg. - Mod.TY
