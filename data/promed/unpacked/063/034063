Death and food poisoning through ingestion of canned sardines has been
documented in Madagascar and elsewhere. There is a toxin in such foods
known as cuprotoxin that
results in this problem. A search of Medline will reveal the case history
which
appeared in Toxicon. Additional references are appended.
