Rabies in Bali: human death list update
---------------------------------------
The numbers of reported human rabies deaths in Bali during the
outbreak discovered in September 2008 have now surpassed 40,
according to local news accounts. The roster of the reported victims,
below, was compiled largely by Dayu Patmara of the Bali Animal
Welfare Association.

Only 28 of the cases are officially recognized, but most have
involved deaths with classic rabies symptoms, several weeks or months
after a known dog bite. There is also a widespread belief in Bali
that other deaths in remote villages are not being reported. However,
from the information that Dayu Patmara collected, the death of the
25-year-old on 15 Feb 2010 was probably not from rabies.

The response of the Bali authorities to the recent increase in rabies
deaths has been to conspicuously escalate culling dogs, including in
areas where dogs have been vaccinated and collared, at expense of
putting more personnel to work doing vaccination at a more rapid pace.

The most ambitious vaccination campaign continues to be that of the
privately funded Bali Animal Welfare Association, which is managing
to vaccinate from 250 to 400 dogs per day in the Gianyar region.
[Actually, an even higher number (500-600 per day) according to the
group. Mod.LM]

[The number of human fatalities continues to rise with victims
ranging in age from 3 to 81 years, indicating that the availability
of effective post-exposure treatment is inadequate. The number of
fatalities now exceeds 40 compared with the 27 deaths recorded on 27
Dec 2009.

Visitors to and residents of the Indonesian island of Bali should be
aware that the problem of canine rabies is far from controlled, and
if bitten they should make their own arrangements for post-exposure
treatment.
