Four new cases emerged over the weekend and, for the 1st time, a greyhound has been confirmed as suffering from the flesh-destroying condition [Alabama rot/cutaneous & renal glomerular vasculopathy].

The 1st dogs to contract the mysterious disease were greyhounds in the southern United States in the 1980s. It took then almost 30 years to appear in Britain, but since 2012, cases have steadily increased across a wide geographical area.

The announcement today [16 May 2017] that 4 new cases have been confirmed in Radcliffe, Greater Manchester; West Chiltington, West Sussex; North Chailey, East Sussex; and Cullumpton, Devon, brings the total number of dogs infected to 102 across 29 different [UK] counties.

News of the latest victims emerged today [16 May 2017] as clinicians, academics, microbiologists, epidemiologists and human medical experts review the findings of last week's conference on the disease, which was hosted by Britain's leading experts David Walker and colleague Laura Holm from Anderson Moores Veterinary Specialists in Hampshire.

"Research is vital if we are to understand more about this condition, find a cause, and be able to prevent or treat it, and funding is essential to achieve these goals," said Mr Walker today [16 May 2017].

"The conference was very positive, with everyone contributing greatly to the discussion, and we look forward to continuing to work with our fellow professionals to research this condition. We've already started the process of setting up a steering committee to help focus the enormous experience and knowledge from the 30 specialists who gave up their time for free to attend. Among the items we discussed was the sharing of data from similar human health issues to identify any possible connections. Of course, the news of more confirmed cases today [16 May 2017] just increases the need to focus on discovering why this condition occurs."

Known clinically as idiopathic cutaneous and renal glomerular vasculopathy (CRGV), the way dogs contract the disease is still unknown.

It invariably begins after a dog has been out walking, and the 1st signs are lesions developing on the lower legs. As the illness takes hold, dogs decline quickly as they succumb to kidney failure. From the 1st sores to death can be as quick as 7 days.

With 19 confirmed British cases this year [2017] alone, Anderson Moores is working closely with Vets4Pets, with its 400 practices nationwide, along with UK veterinary schools and the Alabama Rot Research Fund. All vets in the UK and Ireland are being asked to provide details of suspected cases.

"We would encourage all vets and owners to work with David and his team at Anderson Moores so we can have a clear picture of confirmed cases in the UK and Ireland to help prevent more dogs falling victim to this terrible disease," said Dr Huw Stacey, vet and director of clinical services at Vets4Pets, who also attended the conference.

"Treatment is supportive but is only successful in around 15 to 20 percent of cases, which is why we're encouraging all dog owners to use the online interactive guide to help them understand the clinical signs and confirmed locations of the condition.

"The 1st sign that is normally seen is a skin sore that isn't caused by a known injury. Most commonly, these sores are found on the lower half of the leg and appear as a distinct swelling, a patch of red skin or are open and ulcer-like.

"If a dog becomes affected, the best chance of recovery lies with early and intensive veterinary care at a specialist facility. Such treatment has resulted in some dogs successfully recovering from the condition."

[The proceedings of the recent one-day conference addressing CRGV will be of interest if and when they become available. Hopefully, the brainstorming event will lead to a fruitful coordinated research effort on the etiology of this emerging, still obscure renal health condition. - Mod.AS
