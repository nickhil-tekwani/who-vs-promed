An outbreak of illness [cyclosporiasis] linked to basil imported from Mexico has sickened 120 people in New Jersey and more than 500 in other states since May (2019).

A microscopic parasite, known as _Cyclospora_, appears to have contaminated basil exported by Siga Logistics de RL de CV, in Morelos, Mexico. The company has voluntarily recalled its basil, according to the federal Food and Drug Administration, which is increasing its screening of the imported herb.

You should not buy, eat or serve any fresh basil exported from Mexico by the Siga Logistics company, the state Health Department said. If you don't know what company exported it, avoid basil from Mexico. And if you don't know where the basil came from, avoid it entirely. "We are still working with the Centers for Disease Control and the FDA on traceback efforts," the Health Department said in a statement.

The number of cases in New Jersey this year (2019) is double that of previous years, according to the Health Department. Of the 120 cases confirmed from 21 May through Monday [12 Aug 2019], 4 patients were hospitalized. None of the patients had traveled outside the USA in the 2 weeks before they became sick. No deaths have been reported.

Outbreaks of cyclosporiasis, the disease caused by the parasite, are common from May through August most years. They are usually linked to consumption of fresh greens, vegetables or fruits imported from countries with poor water treatment systems.

Last year (2018), almost 2300 cases were confirmed in 33 states from May through August. Several large outbreaks were reported. The largest involved prepackaged vegetable trays and salad sold at a fast-food chain.

Cyclosporiasis cases have been identified in 19 of New Jersey's 21 counties, with patients ranging from 4 to 84 years old.

The intestinal disease causes frequent loose stools, loss of appetite, weight loss, bloating, stomach cramps, nausea, vomiting, muscle aches, low-grade fever and fatigue. If left untreated, it can last a month. The illness can recur several times after periods of remission.

It is caused by food that has been contaminated with fecal matter containing the parasite. Scientists do not believe it is passed from one person to another. The illness takes 1 to 2 weeks to develop. If you think you have the disease, see a health provider. It is usually treated with a combination of antibiotics.
