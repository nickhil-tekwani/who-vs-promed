[1] South Sudan: MOH press release
Date: Mon 30 Sep 2013

The Government of South Sudan is treating as an utmost priority an outbreak of polio in South Sudan. 3 children have been confirmed with the infection, 2 in Northern Bahr el Ghazal State and another in Eastern Equatoria State.

"We consider this a national health emergency," the Honourable Dr Riek Gai, Minister of Health, said on Monday [30 Sep 2013] morning. We are mobilizing from the highest level of Government to every community in the country in order to stop this disease.

"We are also working closely with WHO, UNICEF, and other key partners around the world and here in South Sudan to ensure the most effective response. Together, we will stop the spread of polio in South Sudan," the Minister added.

Two girls, aged 2 and 8, living in Aweil South County, Northern Bahr el Ghazal State and a 2-year-old girl in Ikotos county, Eastern Equatoria State, were confirmed on 26 Sep 2013 as having polio. The status of the 3 girls is being followed closely. The cases were confirmed by the Kenya Medical Research Institute in Nairobi.

South Sudan had been polio-free since June 2009.

Since the polio outbreak in Somalia was confirmed in May [2013], quickly followed by its spread to Kenya and Ethiopia, medical authorities across South Sudan have been on high alert to look for any possible cases in this country. The Ministry of Health and its partners conducted additional polio vaccination campaigns in August [2013] in the States considered most at risk from the outbreak in the affected countries on its borders. Those States were Upper Nile, Jonglei, Eastern Equatoria, and Central Equatoria. Pariang County in Unity State was also included in that vaccination campaign.

Immediately following the confirmation of the 3 polio cases, the Government and partners responded with emergency vaccinations in the areas where the virus was detected. The emergency "mop-up" campaign, in Aweil South County in Northern Bahr el Ghazal State, and Gogrial West county in Warrap State and Ikotos and Budi counties in Eastern Equatoria State will continue through 4 Oct [2013]. This "mop-up" campaign is designed to stop the spread of the virus quickly.

Additional campaigns will be held in every State in the country in October, November, and December [2013]. This will be an ongoing process to ensure children in South Sudan are protected from polio. The Government of South Sudan is also continuing to coordinate with neighboring countries in polio eradication efforts.

"We are organizing intensive vaccination campaigns throughout the country to protect our children against this devastating disease. We are determined to stop the spread of polio," the Minister said, "And we need everyone in the country to help us. We appeal to all parents to make sure their children are vaccinated. Protect your children through routine immunization and by making sure they receive additional polio vaccinations. We are working together for the eradication of polio. As long as polio exists anywhere in the world, every unimmunized child is at risk.

Data in WHO as of 25 Sep 2012 for 2012 data and 24 Sep 2013 for 2013 data.

Highlights of week
------------------
- In the Horn of Africa, intensive outbreak response is continuing. The impact of the response is beginning to be seen, as the number of newly-reported cases from Banadir, Somalia (the epicentre of the outbreak) has declined. At the same time, operations are improving as more children are being reached, including in some inaccessible areas of south-central Somalia. The risk this outbreak poses for the entire region was again underscored this week, however, as 2 further cases from Ethiopia have been confirmed.

- In Pakistan, 12 new cVDPV2 cases are reported this week, the bulk in North Waziristan, FATA.

Afghanistan
-----------
- No new WPV cases were reported in the past week.
- All 4 WPV cases this year were reported from Eastern Region. The most recent WPV1 case had onset of paralysis on [23 Jul 2013], from Kunar province.
- No WPV3 has been detected in Afghanistan since April 2010.
- No new circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) cases were reported in the past week. The total number of cVDPV2 cases in 2013 remains 3. The most recent cVDPV2 case had onset of paralysis on [13 Mar 2013] (from Kandahar, Southern Region).
- In Southern Region, in the highest-risk areas, an analysis of the immunization status of non-polio acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) cases indicates overall immunity levels continue to improve. As many as 85 percent of children aged less than 3 years have received at least 3 doses of OPV [oral polio vaccine], an increase from 60 percent at the same time last year.
- Subnational immunization days (SNIDs) were held last week [15-17 Sep 2013], in low performing districts of Southern Region and Eastern Region. Preparations are ongoing for nationwide campaigns in early October [2013].

Nigeria
-------
- No new WPV cases were reported in the past week. The total number of WPV cases for 2013 remains 47 (all WPV1s). The most recent WPV1 case in the country had onset of paralysis on [17 Aug 2013] (from Taraba).
- No WPV3 has been detected in Nigeria since November 2012.
- No new cVDPV2 cases were reported in the past week. The total number of cVDPV2 cases for 2013 remains one (with onset of paralysis on [6 Jun 2013], from Borno).
- The primary challenge remains accessing all children in Borno state and further improve operational challenges in Kano state.
- Subnational immunization plus days (IPDs) across northern states were conducted on [7-10 Sep 2013]. Preparations for these latest campaigns had focused on identified highest-risk areas. In advance of that round, immunizations had taken place in wards of very high-risk LGAs.
- OPV will be administered along with measles vaccine during Child Health Days in north and middle-band states in early October [2013].

Pakistan
--------
- No new WPV cases were reported in the past week. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2013 remains 28. The most recent WPV1 case in the country had onset of paralysis on [19 Aug 2013] (from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa-KP).
- 12 new cVDPV2 cases were reported in the past week, 11 from North Waziristan, Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) and one from Gadap, greater Karachi, Sindh. Onsets of paralysis of the new cases are from [3 Jul to 21 Aug 2013]. This brings the total number of cVDPV2 cases for 2013 to 24.
- The cases in North Waziristan are particularly concerning, as it is in an area where immunizations have been suspended by local leaders since last June [?2013 vs 2012]. Immunizations in neighbouring high-risk areas are being intensified, to further boost population immunity levels in those areas and prevent further spread of this outbreak. North Waziristan is also affected by WPV1 transmission.
- Additionally, 4 new environmental samples tested positive for WPV1, from Peshawar, FATA; Gadap, Sindh; Rawalpindi, Punjab; and, Multan, Punjab. Detection of the sample in Multan is particularly concerning, as WPV1 had not been detected in this area since early 2012.
- Confirmation of these latest cases in FATA underscores the risk ongoing polio transmission (be it due to WPV or cVDPV) in this area continues to pose to children everywhere, and in particular to children living in areas where access has not been possible for extended periods of time. FATA is the major poliovirus reservoir in Pakistan and in Asia, with confirmed circulation of both WPV1 and cVDPV2. More than 350 000 children in this area are regularly missed in inaccessible areas, during immunization activities. Efforts are ongoing to curb transmission in this area, including through vaccination at transit points and conducting short interval additional dose (SIADs) campaigns in areas that have recently become accessible.

Chad, Cameroon, and Central African Republic
--------------------------------------------
- In Chad, no new WPV cases were reported in the past week. The most recent WPV case had onset of paralysis on [14 Jun 2012] (WPV1 from Lac). No new cVDPV2 cases were reported in the past week. The total number of cVDPV2 cases for 2013 remains 4 (the most recent cVDPV2 case had onset of paralysis on [12 May 2013] from Ennedi). A small-scale supplementary immunization activity took place on [30 Aug 2013-1 Sep 2013], with staggered, larger-scale SNIDs currently ongoing. Nationwide activities are planned for late October [2013].
- In Cameroon, no new cVDPV2 cases were reported in the past week. The total number of cVDPV2 cases for 2013 remains 3. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on [19 Jul 2013] (from Extreme-Nord). NIDs are planned for [11-13 Oct 2013].
- Central African Republic (CAR) continues to be at serious risk of re-infection due to proximity with Chad, ongoing insecurity and humanitarian crises, and destruction of health infrastructure. To minimize the risk and consequences of potential re-infection, 2 subnational immunization campaigns were conducted in some areas in June and July [2013]. Discussions are ongoing for further activities, potentially in October and November [2013].

Horn of Africa
--------------
- 7 new WPV1 cases were reported in the past week, 5 from Somalia and 2 from Ethiopia. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2013 in the Horn of Africa is 191 (174 from Somalia, 14 from Kenya, and 3 from Ethiopia. The most recent WPV1 case in the region had onset of paralysis on [30 Aug 2013] (from Ethiopia).
- The 2 new cases from Ethiopia are both from Somali region, bordering Somalia. It is from this region that the 1st case from the country had been reported. Active case searches for any additional potential cases is continuing.
- Because of routes of poliovirus spread in previous Horn of Africa outbreaks, this area of Ethiopia had been considered at 'high risk', and since June [2013] had been conducting large-scale immunization campaigns. The response continues to be further strengthened. For example, World Food Programme (WFP) field monitors have been sensitized on AFP surveillance, and a proposal is being evaluated to use community volunteers to further intensify surveillance.
- 28 Permanent Vaccination Posts have now been established along the Ethiopia-Somalia border areas and at large transit points.
- Social mobilization and mass media activities continue to be scaled up in the country, including jingles on TV and radio and banner productions for local levels.
- The next campaign in Ethiopia will be NIDs, on [26-28 Sep 2013].
- Outbreak response in Somalia and Kenya is also continuing, as well as other areas of the Horn of Africa, notably Yemen. As a result of concerted outbreak response efforts, the impact of the response is beginning to be seen, as the number of newly-reported cases from Banadir, Somalia (the epicentre of the outbreak) has declined. At the same time, operations are improving as more children are being reached, including in some inaccessible areas of south-central Somalia. However, more needs to be done, for as many as 500 000 children remain inaccessible in parts of south-central Somalia.

Israel and West Bank and Gaza
-----------------------------
- Although no case of paralytic polio has been reported, WPV1 has been detected in 96 sewage samples from 27 sampling sites in Israel, collected from [3 Feb to 25 Aug 2013], indicating widespread transmission throughout the country. 3 positive samples have also been collected from the West Bank and Gaza (the most recent on [20 Aug 2013]).
- To interrupt WPV1 transmission, a supplementary immunization activity (SIA) with bivalent OPV targeting children up to the age of 9 years has been ongoing since August [2013] in Israel.
- SIAs for West Bank and Gaza have been tentatively scheduled for October and November [2013].

West Africa
-----------
- No new WPV cases were reported in the past week. The most recent case in the region was a WPV1 from Tahoua province in Niger with onset of paralysis on [15 Nov 2012].
- No new cVDPV2 cases were reported in the past week from Niger. The country has reported a single case of cVDPV2 in 2013, with onset of paralysis on [11 Jul 2013]. Genetic sequencing has shown that the virus is related to that seen in Cameroon, Chad and Nigeria (Borno).
- Multi-country synchronized immunization campaigns are planned in West Africa for late October [2013]. Additional subnational campaigns were conducted [7-9 Sep 2013] in Niger, and additional rounds are planned in the region for early November [2013].

[Since the last ProMED-mail Poliomyelitis update on 27 Aug 2013 (Poliomyelitis update (21): global 20130829.1911713), there have been an increase in total numbers of confirmed WPV cases from 214 to 270 as of 24 Sep 2013. The overwhelming majority of these newly confirmed cases are from the ongoing outbreak in the Horn of Africa where there have been 49 new cases confirmed in the past month according to the Polio Eradication Initiative website. This does not include the newly confirmed cases (3) in South Sudan.

The spread of the outbreak to South Sudan is disconcerting and disappointing. There are other countries in the surrounding areas where there is known population movement that have not confirmed cases of WPV associated polio as yet, but where the risk is high, given substantial pockets of inadequately immunized children. Reported polio vaccination coverages are available on the WHO website and show suboptimal coverages in the Sudan, Yemen, Djbouti to name a few (http://apps.who.int/immunization_monitoring/globalsummary/timeseries/tscoveragepol3.html).

In Pakistan, while there were only 3 newly confirmed WPV cases in the past month, the notification of 12 newly confirmed cVDPV2 cases in the hard to access area where there have been difficulties in vaccine acceptance does not bode well for interrupting transmission of the WPV in Pakistan. In addition, the continued circulation of the WPV in Pakistan has been associated with exportation of the WPV to Egypt, Israel and the West Bank and Gaza as seen by WPV isolates taken from sewage samples in these locations that have been genetically linked to the WPV currently circulating in Pakistan.

The continued circulation of the WPV in Israel, Gaza, and the West Bank is also disconcerting, even in the absence of clinical cases thus far. A 1 Sep 2013 press release from the Israeli MOH highlighted the challenges in the area:

"The Ministry of Health appeals to parents in Beer Sheba and Qiryat Gat to have their children promptly vaccinated: "In tests performed this week [week of 1 Sep 2013] at wastewater treatment plants in the southern region, the wild poliovirus was found to be still present in the sewerage of Beer Sheba and Qiryat Gat. The immunization level in Beer Sheba is only 56 percent (approximately 12 000 children have not yet been vaccinated), and in Qiryat Gat it is only 62 percent (approximately 3000 children have not yet been vaccinated)." (http://www.health.gov.il/English/News_and_Events/Spokespersons_Messages/Pages/01092013_1.aspx).
