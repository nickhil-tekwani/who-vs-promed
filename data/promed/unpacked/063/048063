A chikungunya (CHIK) case (23-year-old-man) has been recently
imported from Madagascar in the Bordeaux area (France). This CHIK
case has been confirmed by RT-PCR (reverse transcription polymerase
chain reaction) and serology (dengue serological tests were
negative). He travelled for one month in Madagascar, exclusively in
the Sambava District, North-East, Madagascar, from December [2006] to
14 Jan [2007].
Furthermore, we noticed one additional suspected case imported from
the Sambava area with suggestive clinical symptoms of CHIK
(laboratory test results in progress).
The clinical presentation was typical: no previous symptoms, severe
and incapacitating polyarthralgia associated with high fever, diffuse
exanthematous rash with distal paresthesia, and desquamation
(prominent in palmoplantar area).
Our CHIK case is concurrent with an outbreak of dengue-like syndromes
(no virological [diagnostic] tests) in the Sava District (Sambava,
Anthala, Vohmar, Andapa), recently reported by the local newspaper:
La Tribune de Madagascar, 29 Jan 2007
(<http://www.madagascar-tribune.com/> - archive). Hospitals and
doctors in the Sava District (rural and urban) seem to be overloaded
with 50 percent of the individuals seeming to be affected by the condition.
We postulate that this outbreak of dengue-like syndromes could be the
new huge outbreak of CHIK in the context of [the recent] Indian Ocean
[epidemic].
Our CHIK case highlights the important role of travel medicine
practitioners concerning emerging diseases surveillance.
