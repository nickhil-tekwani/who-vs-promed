On [Mon 10 May 2010], the government raised the red flag over a
possible outbreak of aflatoxin in the country after samples from maize
harvested during the last season were reportedly found contaminated
with the fungal infection.

The alarm comes after Prime Minister Raila Odinga earlier in the year
[2010] directed state agencies to undertake preliminary analysis of
the latest harvested amid fears that the National Cereals and Produce
Board (NCPB) bought contaminated maize from farmers.

The report indicated that samples collected from maize depots in at
least 14 districts in Eastern and Coast Provinces were found to
contain intolerable levels of aflatoxin raising fears of a serious
health risk.

The Premier who chaired the Ministerial Meeting on Food safety at his
office however informed a press conference that the final test on the
suspect maize was yet to be concluded at a later date.

"While results of the final test are not yet available, it is only
prudent to conclude that aflatoxin contamination is widespread and
serious in Eastern and parts of Coast provinces" he said.

The PM announced that a task force would be formulated to address the
technical aspects of the situation and suggest way forward when the
Ministry of Public Health and Sanitation, KEBS [Kenya Bureau of
Standards], NPHLS [National Public Health Laboratory Services], KEPHIS
[Kenya Plant Health Inspectorate Services], and NCPB [National Cereals
and Produce Board] release their findings.

And to avert a looming humanitarian crisis that might result from
consumption of the contaminated maize, Odinga consequently directed
the NCPB to buy back all the suspect stock of maize that was sold out
during the season. He said the Food safety committee was working on a
long-term strategy to contain the impending crisis from unfolding
including proposals to compensate farmers in the affected areas for
loss of income.

"In order to minimize contamination during the current long rains, the
government will mobilize National Youth Service and Army Personnel to
construct appropriate drying and storage in time for the harvest," the
premier announced. He said the government planned to roll out an
aflatoxin awareness campaign immediately to inform the public of the
potential health risk and ways of curbing spread of contamination to
ensure that cases of aflatoxicosis was minimal.

Among the affected districts included Kibwezi, Machakos, Yatta, Mwala,
Mwingi, Makueni, Maara, Imenti South and North, Igembe, Isiolo, Embu
and Bura where a bumper harvest was realized during the last season.
Agriculture Ministers Henry Kosgey and his industrialization
counterpart Sally Kosgey flanked the premier the premier during the
media briefing after attending the food safety committee meeting at
treasury buildings.

The alert measure comes after the country witnessed an outbreak of
aflatoxicosis in 2004. The outbreak claimed at least 150 people lives
after villagers unsuspectingly consumed contaminated maize at the
height of a severe drought

[Aflatoxin is a naturally occurring mycotoxin produced by 2 types of
mold: _Aspergillus flavus_ and _Aspergillus parasiticus_. _A. flavus_
is common and widespread in nature and is most often found when
certain grains are grown under stressful conditions such as drought.
The mold occurs in soil, decaying vegetation, hay, and grains
undergoing microbiological deterioration and invades all types of
organic substrates whenever and wherever the conditions are favorable
for its growth. Favorable conditions include high moisture content and
high temperature. At least 13 different types of aflatoxin are
produced in nature, with aflatoxin B1 considered the most toxic. While
the presence of _A. flavus_ does not always indicate harmful levels of
aflatoxin, it does mean that the potential for aflatoxin production is
present (source
<http://archive.gipsa.usda.gov/newsroom/backgrounders/b-aflatox.pdf>).

Aflatoxins are acutely toxic and have been shown to be carcinogenic
for humans. Animals are susceptible to acute death and liver damage
when exposed to high doses, but seldom develop cancer following
long-term low-level exposure. The toxicity varies between different
species, but data from a large outbreak of poisoning in India in 1974,
which involved moldy maize and in which nearly 100 people died,
suggests that the toxicity of aflatoxin B1 for humans lies somewhere
between that for the dog and that for the rat. The involvement of
aflatoxins with human cancer is more complex and remains to be defined
(source <http://www.who.int/foodsafety/publications/capacity/en/2.pdf>).

Any of the produce fed to animals, may produce clinical signs in the
animals, including a decrease of production, such as a drop in milk
production. - Mod.TG]
