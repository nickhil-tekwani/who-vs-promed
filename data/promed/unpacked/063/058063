The Niger state Commissioner of Health, Dr. Mustapha Jibril, has disclosed that the state has recorded 33 cases of measles and one case of yellow fever in the state this year [2018].

According to him, the case of yellow fever was reported in Borgu local government area, adding that reactive vaccination campaigns have started in the local government and surrounding local government areas in order to curtail it.

Briefing newsmen on the 2018 measles vaccination campaign in Minna, the Commissioner said that the cases were recorded before the commencement of the measles campaign which started on 10 Jan 2018.

According to him, 216 measles cases were reported in 2017, but 67 were confirmed, adding that if the measles vaccination campaign goes on as planned, there would be limited cases of measles in 2019 in the state.

He said that in 3 days, 542 712 children under the age of 9 have been vaccinated, stating that with this development, there is optimism that the target of immunising 1.2 million children would be surpassed.

Jibril said that all the local government Chairman and ward Councillors should fully participate, monitor and supervise the measles vaccination campaign, and report any non-compliances or rejection.

The Executive Director of the Niger state Primary Healthcare Development Agency, Dr. Yahaya Na'uzo, said that 12 000 health personnel have been deployed to 1800 vaccination centers in all the local government areas to ensure adequate coverage of the campaign.

He said that for effective monitoring and supervision, the measles campaign was scheduled for 2 phrases; the 1st phrase would take place in 16 local government areas starting on 10 Feb and ending on 16 Feb 2018, while the 2nd phrase will begin from 20-26 Feb 2018 in 9 local government areas.

Na'uzo expressed satisfaction in the turnout, adding that if the turnout continues, the target of vaccinating 1.2 million children would be surpassed.

European officials said on Tue [13 Feb 2018] that the spike in the number of measles cases in Europe was due to epidemics in Romania, Italy, Germany and Greece.

According to the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control, more than 14 400 cases were reported by 30 countries [in Europe] last year [2017] compared with about 4600 cases the year before [2016].

In mid-January 2018, Greece's Center for Disease Prevention and Control (KEELPNO) reported that it had recorded 1185 cases of measles. The measles outbreak in Greece began last May [2017].

A 35-year-old woman who had been given a measles vaccine dose has become the 3rd victim of the disease in Greece, after she died of pneumonia and respiratory failure.

To date, as reported by the Hellenic Center for Disease Control & Prevention (KÎ•ELPNO), 1588 cases of measles have been recorded in Greece [note that the report above states 1185 cases], with a higher occurrence in the southern part of the country.

The vast majority of victims are Greek citizens, mostly young children from Roma communities and people from the general population in the 25-44 age group who are not immune to measles. Also, some non-vaccinated health professionals are among the victims.

Overall, 3 deaths from laboratory-confirmed cases of measles have been recorded so far in Greece.

The 1st victim was an 11-month-old toddler with underlying dystrophy, while the 2nd was a 17-year-old Roma who died of encephalitis, according to KEELPNO.

Peel Public Health confirmed a 2nd case of the measles in Brampton on Fri 16 Feb 2018, this time in an infant who recently travelled on a flight from Zurich, Switzerland on 12 Feb 2018.

In a release sent Fri 16 Feb 2018, health officials issued a warning and advisory to anyone travelling on an Air Canada flight from Switzerland on the morning of 12 Feb 2018 [see URL for flight details and other possible locations where exposure may have occurred].

Those who travelled on that flight are being advised by Peel Public Health to do the following:

- "Check your immunization records to make sure you and your children have had 2 doses of the measles vaccine (MMR or MMRV). Your child's immunization record (yellow card) or your doctor can provide this information. Two doses of measles vaccine are recommended for anyone born after 1969."

- "Watch for symptoms of measles for 21 days after exposure. These include a high fever; cold-like symptoms (cough/runny nose); sore eyes or sensitivity to light; small spots with a white centre on the inside of the mouth; and a red rash lasting 4-7 days."

This is the 2nd case of measles confirmed in Brampton in as many days. Peel Health officials confirmed a case in an adult yesterday [Fri 16 Feb 2018], also from Brampton. That person also recently travelled internationally, said officials.

"The virus can only live outside the body on surfaces and in the air for up to 2 hours, so people who visited these locations or used these services at other times are not at risk," Peel Public Health said in a statement.

Anyone who believes they or a family member may have been exposed in either case must call ahead to any medical facilities they plan to visit to alert them that they have come into contact with someone with the virus.

The Davao City Health Office on Fri [16 Feb 2018] said the measles outbreak declared last 22 Jan 2018 has yet to be lifted, even as the number of people infected by the viral disease has gone down.

According to a News to Go report, the city health office confirmed 23 out of over 300 suspected cases of measles infection recorded since November 2017, saying it was still considered above the norm.

Earlier, as of last 6 Jan 2018, a total of 222 Davao City residents tested positive for measles. On Fri [16 Feb 2018], the health office said 18 infected people in the city have died.

Local health officials said the measles outbreak was not connected to the "Dengvaxia scare," which transpired after the government's nationwide anti-dengue program vaccinated over 800 000 children with Dengvaxia, a drug that was later warned to result in severe symptoms if administered to children who have not yet contracted the dengue virus.

The health office also noted that, due to the public's fear of being vaccinated, the city's immunization rate was low.

The report said the Department of Health, for its part, assured the public that the measles vaccine was tried and tested.
