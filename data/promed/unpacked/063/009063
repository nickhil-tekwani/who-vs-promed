----------------------------------------------------------------------
The reports by the EpiCore team members are wrong. This is not the 1st report of CCHF from India. It was reported in the last week of December 2010 and January 2011. In those days the National Institute of Virology (NIV) Pune, India had done the confirmatory test.

I was a member of a team which took care of nurses working in the affected hospital who returned to Kerala (their home state) during the panic period. Please see page 68 of this link http://dhs.kerala.gov.in/docs/part3.pdf (links to the full document: http://dhs.kerala.gov.in/docs/part1.pdf and http://dhs.kerala.gov.in/docs/part2.pdf).

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Joseph for his valuable contribution. Dr Joseph has shared helpful links for very informative documents titled "Epidemiological situation of communicable diseases in Kerala (2006 - 2010)", available at the links mentioned in the report above, which describe CCHF outbreak in a private hospital in Gujarat during December 2010-January 2011. Based on this information, there is indeed evidence that CCHF cases have been reported from Gujarat State as early as December 2010.

ProMED-mail staff appreciate the EpiCore member responses to posted RFIs and their valuable contributions. - Mod.UBA
