Robert Davies, of Hopes Ash Farm, in Hope Mansell, near Ross-on-Wye, has
told the Gazette that the farm is in the grip of a devastating bovine
tuberculosis (bTB) outbreak, but he feels it is important to share his
experience with the local community.

Mr Davies told the Ross Gazette that he had kept a diary where he outlined
what was happening at the farm and how the loss of the cattle, which had
been part of their herd for many years, affected the family, emotionally and
financially.

So far, 27 in-calf heifers have been destroyed, 22 tested positive for bTB
in an initial test, and 5 others have since tested positive. Although
there is compensation available, Mr Davies said this is not enough to
replace these high-quality home-bred cows, and their unborn calves.

Mr Davies wants to raise awareness, to those without experience of farming,
of how overwhelming the battle against bTB is. He has met with DEFRA and bTB
advisors and hopes that he has done as much as he can to highlight the
situation.

He commented: "The futile battle faced by farmers every day is largely
unreported and one which I believe the general public should be made more
aware of."

Oliver Cartwright, NFU spokesman, has told the Ross Gazette that Bovine TB
remains a huge threat to Herefordshire's beef and dairy industry.

He commented: "It has been proven without doubt that badgers are a reservoir
of bTB and that the disease transmits between badgers and cattle."

"Controlling the disease in wildlife, therefore, in areas where it is rife,
is an absolutely vital part of any package of measures if we are to
successfully get on top of it and stop reinfection occurring."

Mr Cartwright continued: "The NFU will continue to make the case to the next
Government on this issue which is having such a devastating impact in the
county."

[On top of the serious losses incurred by bTB to cattle and the farming industry, this zoonotic bacterium has affected, on UK farms, alpacas. It is transmissible to pets, challenging humans (see 20140327.2361967).

In Oct 2016, DEFRA published a document addressing "11 questions about bovine tuberculosis", which is available at
https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/569292/RFI_8538_and_8551_-_response_Redacted.pdf

According to statistics released in late April 2017 by the Irish Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the amount of cattle that have been slaughtered for bovine TB had increased during the 1st 3 months of 2017: a total of 2849 animals were culled in total, up 252 compared to the same time in 2016. This translates to a herd incidence rate of 2.60 percent nationally for the start of 2017, which is up from 2.39 percent for the same period in 2016.
