Its been confirmed Western Australia (WA) has Ovine Johnes Disease (OJD).
Six properties, having both sheep and goats, in the States central
wheatbelt have been quarantined, although the disease has only been
detected in one goat at this stage.
Agriculture WA is now discussing plans to eradicate the disease from the
one affected property.
From Perth, David Cussons reports, "Ovine Johne's disease was discovered
in a goat, as part of an ongoing surveillance program, conducted by
Agriculture WA. If not eradicated, it will jeopardise the OJD free zone
status the state currently enjoys. Six properties in the area have been
placed under quarantine, and with continued testing and tracing of stock
movements, this number may increase. Agriculture WA and industry are also
considering options for a compensation scheme to cover destocking
requirements."

[Although previous titles on ProMED-mail have read "Ovine-Johnes," I think
the correct term should be "Johnes Disease, Sheep," or "Johnes Disease,
Ovine." Johnes is NOT just a bovine disease.
Johnes Disease is caused by _Mycobacterium avium paratuberculosis_,
formerly known as _M paratuberculosis_. Paratuberculosis is a chronic,
contagious enteritis, characterized by progressive, and persistent diarrhea,
debilitation, weight loss, and eventually death. It affects, cattle, sheep,
goats, llamas, camels, farmed deer, and other domestic, exotic and wild
ruminants. It has ben recognized in wild rabbits, too. Horses and pigs have
been infected experimentally, only. The distribution of this disease is
worldwide.
Crohn´s disease is a chronic enteritis in man. There is conflicting data on
the involvement of the causative organism in Crohn´s disease. Therefore,
animals with paratuberculosis should be considered as potential zoonotic
risks until the situation with Crohn´s disease is clarified.
Johnes Disease is characterized by weight loss and diarrhea, but initially
the signs are vague and variable. Diarrhea may be intermittent, is
typically thick, does not contain blood or mucus. The diarrhea becomes more
severe over weeks or months and there is further weight loss. Dairy animals
have a drop in milk production. The disease is progressive and terminates
in emaciation and death.
There is not single, good diagnostic test. A combination of tests is often
used. Diagnosis is easier on a group of animals than a single animal. Fecal
culture is specific, but not highly sensitive because the organisms are
shed intermittently. Serological tests vary in sensitivity and specificity
and are poor at identifying sub clinical cases.
There is no known treatment for paratuberculosis. Control requires good
sanitation and management. There is a vaccine used in some countries, and
subject to approval by regulatory agencies and restricted to infected
herds. Vaccines and diagnostic tests are limited in efficacy. Calfhood
(less than 1 month of age) vaccination can be effective in reducing disease
incidence but does not eliminate the infection.
Cattle inoculated with the inactivated, whole-cell, mineral-oil vaccine
develop granulomas, up to several cm in diameter, at the site of
inoculation, which is usually the brisket. These vaccines may cause the
cattle to react positively on subsequent tuberculin test. Accidental
self-inoculation can result in severe acute reactions with sloughing and
chronic synovitis and tendinitis. Vaccination does not eliminate the need
for good sanitation and management - Mod.TG
