Concomitant dual infection by leptospira and hantavirus is probably a less rare combination of infections than generally anticipated, but since multiple organ failure (MOF) in leptospirosis is globally better (and longer) known than hantavirus-induced MOF, serological proof of the latter is much less frequently considered, particularly so if, in a 1st diagnostic approach, leptospirosis is found serologically confirmed.

Both zoonoses, although of totally different origin, induce remarkably similar symptoms and laboratory anomalies, including renal and hepatic involvement with initial but transient proteinuria and microhematuria, "transaminitis," hyponatremia, hypokalemia despite renal function impediment, etc., (Clement J, Hinrichsen S, Crescente J, Bigaignon G, Yersin C, Muthusethupathi M, et al. Am J Trop Med Hyg 1999; 61 (Suppl.):316-317).

Hantavirus-induced hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) has to be considered in the differential diagnosis of leptospirosis-suspected cases in the New and the Old World (Clement J, Maes P, Van Ranst M. Acute Kidney Injury in emerging, non-tropical Infections. Acta Clin Belg 2007;62:387-95).

Concomitant dual infection by leptospira and hantavirus was recently demonstrated in a country hyperendemic for leptospirosis, such as Sri Lanka (Sunil-Chandra NP, Clement J, Maes P, de Silva HJ, Van Esbroeck M, Van Ranst M. Concomitant leptospirosis-hantavirus co-infection in acute patients hospitalized in Sri Lanka: implications for a potentially worldwide underestimated problem. Epidemiol Inf 2015;143(10):2081-2093 doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0950268814003707. Epub 13 Jan 2015), as well as in a non-endemic country, such as Belgium (Clement J, Van Esbroeck M, Lagrou K, Verschueren J, Sunil-Chandra NP, Van Ranst M. Letter to the Editor: Leptospirosis versus hantavirus infections in the Netherlands and in Belgium, 2000 to 2014. Euro Surveill. 2014;19(38):pii=20912. Available online: http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=20912).

It is no coincidence that the Bolivian journal El Periodico pictures 2 rats [they appear to be the brown rat, _Rattus norvegicus_ - Mod.TY] for the publication of the fatal dual infection in this 6-year-old boy, since the wild rat is the main global reservoir and vector of the 2 now found zoonoses. If so, then the victim suffered in fact (also, besides leptospirosis) from rat-induced Seoul virus (SEOV) HFRS, instead of some form of HCPS. In that case, CENETROP in Santa Cruz has to be warned that exact determination of the causative SEOV is not reliable with serological techniques alone, since the most widely used screening antigens for hantavirus infections in South America are based on Andes virus (ANDV) and/or Araraquara virus (ARAV). These sigmodontid hantaviruses cross-react poorly with the murid SEOV, which consequently can be missed.

It is noteworthy that the boy apparently did not have extreme dyspnoea, the cardinal hallmark of severe HCPS, but all the clinical features of HFRS. If confirmed indeed as a SEOV infection, this would be the 2nd fatal SEOV case in the Americas after the 2012 Texan case (Roig IL, Musher DM, Tweardy DJ: Severe Pulmonary Involvement in a Case Attributed to Domestically Acquired Seoul Hantavirus in the United States. Clin Infect Dis. 2012; 54(1): 91-4. doi: 10.1093/cid/cir748; http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/54/1/91.long).

Moreover, it would be, to our knowledge, the 1st fatal case in the Americas, and even worldwide, attributed to a concomitant dual infection by leptospira and a hantavirus.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr. Clement and his colleagues for this insightful comment on the dual leptospitosis-hantavirus infection. They make an important point: It is easy to be focused on a single pathogen, forgetting that 2 or more pathogens that can produce similar symptoms may be present concurrently. They also underscore the need to be able to differentiate Seoul hantavirus, with its wide distribution around the world, from hantaviruses found in the Americas. - Mod.TY
