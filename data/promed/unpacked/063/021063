Following the ban on the Ghaziabad-based pharmaceutical company Biomed Pvt Ltd, the ministry is now looking for options to arrange the vaccines in time for vaccinating the pilgrims, the sources said. Around 1.27 lakh people are expected to go for the annual Hajj pilgrimage in July this year [2019] for which the ministry will have to arrange for at least 1.47 lakh doses. [A lakh is a unit in the Indian numbering system equal to one hundred thousand (100 000).] Extra vaccines are kept as some are rendered ineffective in the process of delivery to the states.

The Health Ministry is already in talks with 2 firms which import the vaccines, the sources said. Those going to Saudi Arabia for the purpose of Umrah or pilgrimage are required to submit a certificate of vaccination with the quadrivalent (ACYW135) vaccine against meningitis, proving the vaccine was administered no more than 3 years ago and no less than 10 days before arrival in the country.

Biomed Pvt Ltd was a licensed indigenous manufacturer for meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine while 2 firms M/s Sanofi Pasteur India Pvt Lt, Mumbai and M/s GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals Ltd, Mumbai are importers for quadrivalent meningococcal meningitis conjugate vaccine in the country. "Earlier with Biomed Pvt Ltd providing the vaccines, government spent Rs 250 [about USD 3.60] for each vaccine but now if they have to buy from companies which import the vaccines, they may have to shell out around Rs 1500 [about USD 21.50] per dose. The Health Ministry is already in talks with the 2 firms which import the vaccines," the sources said.

Biomed Pvt Ltd was directed to stop the manufacture, sale, and distribution of all human vaccines including the quadrivalent meningococcal meningitis vaccine after type-2 polio virus was found in the sewage and stool samples in Maharashtra, Telangana, and Uttar Pradesh in September [2018]. The polio drops were sent for testing, which confirmed that some of them were contaminated with type-2 virus, a strain believed to have been eradicated in 2016.

The managing director of Biomed Pvt Ltd., which was supplying polio vaccines for only government-run immunisation programmes, was arrested after the central drug regulator filed a complaint and an FIR [first information report] was registered.

The destruction of traces of type-2 polio virus was ordered by the central drug regulator to all manufacturers in 2016.

Umrah and Hajj are pilgrimages to Mecca, Saudi Arabia, performed by Muslims. Umrah can be undertaken at any time of the year, in contrast to the Hajj. The days of Hajj in 2019 begin in the evening of Fri 9 Aug and end in the evening of Wed 14 Aug. The Hajj is a mandatory religious pilgrimage to Mecca, Saudi Arabia that must be carried out at least once in their lifetime by all adult Muslims who are physically and financially capable of undertaking the journey (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hajj); the Umrah is not compulsory (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umrah).

Saudi Arabia issues its requirements for entry into Saudi Arabia for the Hajj, which are updated annually. The Hajj requirements for 2019 can be found at https://www.saudiembassy.net/hajj-requirements. With regard to vaccinations, "The applicant must submit proof of vaccination for meningitis and ACYW135. For infants and children up to 15 years of age, a vaccination report is required for polio as well as meningitis and polio. Children over 15 years of age should present the same vaccinations requested for adults:
a. meningitis and ACYW135;
b. seasonal (or common) flu, which should be taken 2 weeks before applying for the visa;
c. H1N1 flu, if a vaccine is made available before Hajj season, and should be taken 2 weeks before applying for the visa;
d. infants and children up to 15 years of age should provide a vaccination report for meningococcal and polio;
e. children above 15 years of age should present the same vaccinations requested for adults;
f. health experts advise the following groups to postpone their plans for Hajj and Umrah this year for their own safety: The elderly, the terminally ill, pregnant women, and children."
"Travelers must carry vaccination certificates with them for inspection by the Saudi Authority at port of entry."
