More than 10 people have died following an outbreak of Rift Valley fever [RVF] in Kenya, with more than 120 cases reported countrywide. On [Thu 12 Jun 2018], international medical-humanitarian organisation Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) sent a team to Wajir County, the most affected county, to support the Kenyan Ministry of Health (MoH) in containing and managing the disease.

RVF is caused by a virus transmitted by mosquitoes and blood-feeding flies that usually affects animals (commonly cattle, camels, and sheep), but it can also affect humans. In humans, the disease ranges from a mild flu-like illness to severe haemorrhagic fever that can be lethal.

The outbreak was confirmed on [Thu 7 Jun 2018] after 4 patients who had died in Wajir tested positive with the disease. So far, 85 cases, including 3 patients who were readmitted, have been reported in the county, with 6 having died since the beginning of the outbreak.

"We 1st assessed the situation on the ground, then worked together with the Ministry of Health to identify gaps in the response," said Ahmed Garat, MSF's Emergency Field Coordinator leading the response.

The team set up an isolation centre in which patients can be managed at the Wajir County Referral Hospital. So far, 6 patients have been treated at the facility. "MSF will continue monitoring the situation and responding where necessary, and we are hopeful that the situation will improve with better contingencies in place, although RVF tends to be quite unpredictable," adds Garat. MSF is also providing medical supplies to the county to aid in containing the disease.

MSF is working closely with the MoH, training staff on patient management and diagnosis of cases, enhancing their capacity to detect and rapidly respond and contain the outbreak. In a training that involves patients and their caretakers as well, the staff will also be trained on prevention aspects, vector control, and use of mosquito nets.

[The number of human Rift Valley fever cases continues to slowly increase. Since Fri [11 May 2018], the beginning of the outbreak, a cumulative total of 90 cases and 10 deaths (case fatality rate 11 percent) was reported as of Wed [27 Jun 2018]. The nationwide case count for all of Kenya now stands at more than 120 with more than 10 deaths. The [Fri 29 Jun 2018] WHO summary reported that the most affected age group was 21-30 years, with men making up 70 percent of the ProMED-mail cases. At that time, 3 counties were affected: Wajir (78 cases, 6 deaths), Marsabit (11 cases, 3 deaths), and Siaya (1 case, 1 death) (see ProMED-mail archive Rift Valley fever - Eastern Africa (10): Kenya, WHO, livestock vaccination 20180704.5886934). Increased surveillance by the Ministry of Health with the collaboration of MSF will be important in case-finding and timely treatment.

In the previous ProMED-mail post, Mod.AS pointed out that, so far, the virus has been shown as active in 7 out of Kenya's 47 counties. In addition to the 6 above, the following counties have been recognized as currently at high risk for RVF: Tana River, Tharaka Nithi, Garissa, Lamu, Baringo, Mombasa, and Nairobi. Obviously, preventive measures, including mass vaccination of susceptible animal species, are urgently required in the counties above and by others at-risk who are not yet infected (see ProMED-mail archive Rift Valley fever - Eastern Africa (10): Kenya, WHO, livestock vaccination 20180704.5886934).

The prolonged rains mentioned in earlier reports have doubtless provided breeding sites for RVF virus vector mosquitoes. The loss of hundreds of camels, sheep, and goats is a significant economic and cultural loss for their owners, many of whom depend on these animals for their livelihoods. - Mod.TY
