The head of the Communicable and Chronic Diseases Division in As-Suwayda, Emile Heneidy, announced that an increase in the number of cases of brucellosis had been recorded during the past 2 months, in the As-Suwayda Governorate, southern Syria.

In an interview today [Wed 29 Jun 2022] with the local newspaper, Al-Watan, Heneidy said that the number of cases recorded during the months of May and June [2022] alone reached about 80, out of 215 cases recorded since the beginning of this year [2022].

Heneidy attributed the reasons for the spread of the disease to the failure to boil milk well, especially during the manufacture of cheese and dairy materials, adding that what exacerbated the issue of its spread was the lack of appropriate medicines availability from the Ministry of Health to cover all cases. This forced patients to buy medicine at their own expense, which is something they cannot afford.

The infection can be transmitted to humans in 3 ways:

1. When touching the secretions of sick animals or materials contaminated with these secretions, or through water contaminated with these secretions, where germs enter through the mouth, conjunctiva of the eye, or wounds.

2. When eating foodstuffs from infected animals, such as milk, cheese, or yoghurt made from unboiled milk, as well as eating the meat of sick animals.

3. Dust transmission, which occurs infrequently during processing the wool of sick animals [sporadic].

Most infections occur in the spring and summer, in the months of March and April, the season for lambing and calving [exposing attenders to post-parturition tissues/amnionic fluid - Mod.AS], while abortions are frequent during this period, leading to a wave of infection spread. In May and June, milk production reaches its peak, leading to a 2nd wave of infection spreading.

Ways to prevent human infection:

- Boil milk for 5 minutes after the start of boiling; boil cheese; avoid eating unpasteurized milk and its derivatives such as cheese and ice cream.
- Cook meat thoroughly and avoid eating it raw.
- Wear gloves when handling animals, especially by slaughterhouse workers or veterinarians.
- Examine continuously those who handle dairy products.
- Slaughter and dispose of infected animals.
- Vaccinate domestic animals and livestock (there is no vaccine available for humans yet).

[Sweida (or As-Suwayda) is a southwestern Syrian governorate bordering Jordan; its population is mainly Druze (for a map of Syria's governorates, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governorates_of_Syria.)

All Middle East [ME] countries are endemically infected by _B. melitensis_, the _Brucella_ species presenting the most severe disease in humans. The main reservoir of _B. melitensis_ is sheep and goats, in which the infection causes abortions during the last trimester of pregnancy.

Syria presents the 2nd-highest incidence of brucellosis in humans in the Middle East, with an incidence rate (IR) of 40.6/100 000 (the list is led by Yemen, with IR of 88.6). Syria is followed by Palestine (IR 19.1), Iran (IR 18.6), Saudi Arabia (IR 12.3), Kuwait (10.8), Oman (IR 9.0), Turkey (IR 8.0), and others. For the above and additional data from ME countries, please refer to table 2 in a 2020 paper (Ref. 1, see citation below). Notably, the table does not cover Lebanon. According to Lebanon's Ministry of public health, 119 cases have been reported this year [2022] as of 25 Jun, peaking in April (25 cases) and May (65 cases) (https://www.moph.gov.lb/userfiles/files/Esu_data/Esu_currentyear/Lebanon.htm).

During the period 2017-2020, a total of 1398 human cases were reported in Lebanon (https://www.fortuneonline.org/articles/a-review-of-brucellosis-a-recent-major-outbreak-in-lebanon.pdf). Lebanon's population (2020) was 6.8 million (https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/lebanon-population/).

The conclusions segment in Ref. 1 (authored by a regional team) deserves to be quoted:

"Brucellosis remains an important, regionally widespread zoonosis with extensive impact throughout the ME, and its control is complicated and hindered by sociopolitical barriers. To take a major step forward toward mitigation of the disease burden in the region, the development, implementation, and adoption of awareness and education campaigns supported by a One Health approach is urgent, and potentially can make an effective change in current disease situations. These campaigns should target all influential stakeholders (e.g., politicians, authorities, professionals, producers, public, policymakers, etc.) and engage various administrative bodies (e.g., public health, veterinary, social welfare, rural affairs, education, environment, municipal, and financing authorities) and be relevant to national, local, cultural, and socioeconomic conditions".

Brucellosis is seriously underreported; it was included in WHO's list of 'neglected zoonotic diseases'.
