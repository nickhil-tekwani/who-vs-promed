About 10 years or so in France there were stories of drugs being freely
distributed illegally by such feed stores for cattle.
Several years ago, a law was passed in France giving pharmacists the
right to give drugs such as antibiotics and steroids to animal owners at
their discretion without a prescription. Not a peep was heard from the
veterinary community nor the Conseil de l'Ordre des Veterinaires (~ French
AVMA). Chloramphenicol was distributed quite freely to farmers for cattle
and numerous abuses were seen. The repercussions as to resistant strains of
bacteria can only be surmised because these practices are not always known.
I can imagine that things are changing for the better with the EEC rules
taking over local laws and customs in France, at least I hope so.
