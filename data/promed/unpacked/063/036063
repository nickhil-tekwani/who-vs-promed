The Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur recorded 73 cases of measles between 1 Jan and 30 Jun this year [2015], with 79 percent of them having not been vaccinated against the disease. Expressing concern over the sudden increase in cases, Director-General of Health Datuk Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah said the victims were aged between a one-month-old infant to a 43-year-old adult. "In view of the increase in cases, I advise parents to get their children vaccinated against the disease by going to any of the nearest government clinics," he said, adding that measles can be eliminated with vaccination.

Measles is a contagious disease that is caused by a virus. Measles starts with fever, runny nose, cough, red eyes, and sore throat followed by a rash that spreads over the body. Measles virus is highly contagious and spreads through the air through coughing and sneezing. Dr Noor Hisham said infants and children should receive 2 doses of the measles vaccination between the ages of 12 months and 7 years old to avoid getting the disease and its complications. He added that it is important for the measles vaccination coverage to be high (above 95 percent) to confer herd immunity, which means that the protection also covers the small group in the population who are not eligible to be vaccinated, such as immuno-compromised patients who have been on chemotherapy or who underwent organ transplantation.

[2] Malaysia (Measles & Chicken-pox)

The Health Ministry will investigate claims of a measles and chickenpox outbreak in Kuala Lumpur, said Director General of Health Datuk Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah when contacted by Astro AWANI today [26 Jul 2015]. Claims of the outbreak surfaced when a team of health officials conducted an inspection on the vaccine cold chain at a clinic in the capital city.

Vaccine cold chain refers to a system of handling vaccines within a particular temperature range to ensure its effectiveness when administered to patients. Concerns over the measles and chickenpox outbreak were raised by a medical officer, who declined to be identified, whose clinic had been visited by health officials 2 weeks ago. "That's what they told us, and there's even a team of nurses going to houses to check on children's vaccine records. We suspect there's an increased risk of infection around the area. They (health officials) have also activated the prevalent system to make sure they arrest the outbreak in this area," he said.

The medical officer believes the inspection was conducted to ensure the vaccines for chickenpox and measles are at optimum levels. "The cold chain is very important with vaccines because we need to make sure they stay at a particular temperature so they will be optimal for a patient being given them. Basically, if the cold chain is broken, the vaccine is not optimal anymore. In one case, a chickenpox outbreak happened because the cold chain had been broken," he said.

Health officials did not reveal the reasons behind their inspection, but the medical officer said that, based on his experience, the inspection was a standard operating procedure (SOP) to prevent the spread of contagious diseases.

In the Moscow district compared to the previous year, the annual number of measles cases has been halved according to the Health and Welfare Organisation (Rospotrebnazora) SEAD of Moscow.

"Despite the decline in measles cases in the 1st half of 2015, an epidemic situation still remains, if the entire Moscow District Administration Area is considered. This year [2015], the district recorded 15 cases of the disease, whereas in the previous year, a total of 37 cases were diagnosed during the corresponding period in the same period last year [2015].

The Rospotrebnadzor [Health and Welfare Organization] warned that the spread of measles was due to the infection, and the disease affected unvaccinated children and unvaccinated or single adults. Also vulnerable are children of the 1st year of life born to unvaccinated mothers. At risk of measles include organized groups and persons living in dormitories, especially visitors originating from other regions of Russia and neighboring countries.

"A negative example is an incident that occurred in this district in June [2015]. During the period from 20 to 28 Jun 2015, one family of 4 developed measles simultaneously at home, consisting of the 4 cases at once. The family consisted of 2 parents and 2 children aged 2 years old. The source of infection was the child who was not vaccinated against measles due to the failure of the mother to get preventive inoculations. In such situations, vaccination should still be provided. In epidemics, vaccination is required for all contacts with patients with measles who may have no reliable information on measles vaccination made or transferred in the last measles outbreak. Measles vaccine is available in sufficient quantities in all Health Department clinics in Moscow.
