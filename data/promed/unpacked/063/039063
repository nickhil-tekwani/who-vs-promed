A new case of the polio virus has been confirmed in a 2-year-old child
in Moyo district.

The district disease surveillance officer, Simon Amudra, said the case
was confirmed on Thursday [28 May 2009] after tests in Entebbe.

Amudra said the victim's mother used to commute from Moyo to Nimule
[Sudan] for trade, where the child was suspected to have contracted
the deadly virus.

"Two other suspected cases have been registered in Moyo and Itula
sub-counties, though not yet confirmed," he said.

The 1st case, that was confirmed in Amuru district after the declaring
of Uganda free of polio, was also suspected to have been contracted
from Sudan.

Since then, the ministry of health has carried a sub-national massive
immunisation against a further spread of the disease in Uganda.

Dufile and Moyo sub-counties share the international boundaries of
Uganda and Sudan.

A case of polio has been confirmed in Pader district ahead of the 2nd
round of the national polio immunisation this month [May 2009].

The disease surveillance officer, Alfred Okidi, said the case was
found at Atanga sub-county in Aruu county. "A 2-and-a-half-year old
child at Lacekocot is infected with the wild polio virus type one," he
said. "We are still investigating another case in the same
sub-county," Okidi told journalists in Pader on Thursday [28 May
2009]. Okidi said the disease outbreak could have been due to the low
polio immunisation coverage when it was last carried out in the
district. He urged residents in the district to safeguard against the
spread of the disease by practicing good hygiene.

Pader resident district commissioner Santo Okot Lapolo asked parents
to take their children aged below 5 for the next immunisation exercise
scheduled for [6 to 9 Jun 2009].

"We want to eradicate polio from our area so that in the next few
years, we don't have representatives of people with disabilities in
the district councils and Parliament due to polio," Lapolo said.

Headlines
* From 29-31 May [2009], 11 countries across west Africa will
conduct a synchronized cross-border immunization campaign, comprising
Benin, Burkina Faso, Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, Guinea, Liberia, Mali,
Niger, Sierra Leone, Togo, as well as Nigeria (the only endemic
country in the region). More than 400 000 volunteers and health
workers will aim to deliver nearly 90 million doses of oral polio
vaccine (OPV) to more than 74 million children under the age of 5
years. This is the 3rd such activity in 2009, following similar
campaigns in February and March [2009].
* Pakistan continues to vaccinate all available children in the
growing IDP [internally displaced persons] emergency. For details, see
Pakistan section.
* The Organisation of the Islamic Conference (OIC) Council of
Foreign Ministers' meeting in Damascus last week has urged the OIC to
work more closely with and provide further assistance to the GPEI
[Global Polio Eradication Initiative] in the last remaining
polio-endemic countries.

Endemic countries:
Afghanistan
* No new cases were reported this week. Afghanistan has reported 7
cases in 2009, all of them wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1). The most
recent case, from Kandahar province, had onset of paralysis on [19 Apr
2009].
* National Immunization Days (NIDs) were held from [23-25 May 2009]
using trivalent oral polio vaccine (tOPV); however, initial monitoring
reports suggest immunization teams continued to be obstructed by
anti-government forces in some key southern areas, with 196 000
children missed as a result.
* Further sub-national immunization days are planned for [21-23 Jun
2009] in selected southern districts using monovalent oral polio
vaccine type 1 (mOPV1).

India
* Six new cases were reported in the past week, one WPV1, in JP
Nagar, Uttar Pradesh (UP) and 5 WPV3s (in the UP districts of Badaun,
Aligarh, Moradabad and Shahjahanpur). The most recent case (WPV3 from
Badaun, UP) had onset of paralysis on [7 May 2009].
* Large-scale SNIDs [SubNational Immunization Days] across UP, Bihar
and key high-risk and re-infected areas are currently being held using
mOPV1. The next SIA, to be held from [28 Jun 2009], is currently being
planned.
* The total number of cases for 2009 is now 49, compared to 240 at
this time last year [2008].

Nigeria
* 20 new cases were reported in the past week: one WPV1 case in
Asari Toru, Rivers state, with onset of paralysis on [29 Mar 2009],
and 19 WPV3 cases, of which 9 were from Kano state and 4 from Yobe.
* The total number of cases for 2009 is now 276, of which 209 cases
are WPV3, 66 of which are type 1, and one is a type 1/3 mixture. The
most recent case had onset of paralysis on [24 Apr 2009] (WPV3 in
Zaria in Kaduna state).
* The next nationwide Immunization Plus Days (IPDs) will be held
from [30 May-2 Jun 2009] using trivalent OPV (tOPV). In conjunction
with the new IPD [Immunization Preventible Diseases] Guidelines,
extensive preparations by all partners have been made for this
upcoming immunization round. For the 1st time, independent monitors
trained by WHO will be in place to verify micro-plans, while in most
high-risk states, governors are committed to ensuring a high-quality
campaign.

Pakistan
* With more than 2.38 million people now internally displaced (IDPs)
in Pakistan due to the ongoing military conflict in North West
Frontier Province (NWFP); this is now the largest IDP crisis
worldwide. The polio program has been immunizing children on main
transit routes or in IDP camps; as of [26 May 2009], 71 671 children
under 5 years of age had been vaccinated. Currently, more than 200 000
people are living in the 26 IDP camps established in NWFP, meaning
more than 90 percent of IDPs, or 2.1 million, are housed with host
families or, increasingly, schools and other public buildings. As a
result, emergency outreach immunization sessions are currently being
planned to vaccinate and register these children.
* Five new cases were reported in the past week: 4 WPV1, one each in
NWFP, Balochistan, Punjab and Sindh, and one WPV3, in Bajour, NWFP.
This WPV3 case is the most recent, with onset of paralysis on [6 May
2009]. The total number of cases for 2009 is now 17.
* NIDs will be held from [28-30 May 2009] distributing tOPV and
Vitamin A. A sub-national immunization round (SNID) is subsequently
planned in selected districts from [22-24 Jun 2009] using mOPV1.

Importation countries:
Angola
* No new cases were reported in the past week. The most recent case
(WPV1 from Luanda province had onset of paralysis on [11 Apr 2009]).
The total number of cases for 2009 is 6 (all WPV1).
* While no cases of WPV3 have been reported, the detection of 2 WPV3
cases in October 2008 and February 2009 in the southern Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC) closely related to the Angolan outbreak (last
case in Namibe Province in November 2008) suggests that transmission
of this serotype continues in Angola.
* The Benguela cases have been covered by one Sub-National
Immunization Day (SNID). The Luanda case will be covered by NIDs
planned for [15-28 Jun 2009] (in conjunction with a measles campaign),
July and August [2009] with tOPV.

Central African Republic (CAR)
* Two new cases were reported in the past week, both WPV3 cases from
Ouham Pende, RS3, the same state that reported a case last week. Last
week's case remains the most recent, with onset of paralysis on [3 May
2009]. The total number of cases for 2009 is now 4.
* No WPV1 has been reported in the country since [30 Dec 2008].
* National Child Health Days were held from [23-25 May 2009]
administering tOPV. An NID is planned for the end of June [2009], most
likely using mOPV3.

Chad
* No new cases were reported in the past week, meaning the WPV3 case
from Chari-Baguirmi remains the only recorded case of 2009, with onset
of paralysis on [1 Apr 2009].
* A staggered, nationwide campaign using tOPV and mOPV1 was
completed on [15-17 May 2009].
* A further sub-national round is planned for the southwest from
[19-21 Jun 2009], immunizing 1.27 million children with mOPV3, with
NIDs using tOPV planned for October and November [2009].

Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC)
* No new cases were reported in the past week. The total number of
cases for 2009 remains one (WPV3 from Kasai Occidental in February
[2009]).
* DRC held a SNID on [7 May 2009], with further SNIDs planned for [4
Jun 2009] and [9 Jul 2009] using a mix of mOPV1, mOPV3 and trivalent
OPV, depending on the risk and circumstances.
* DRC has not had a WPV1 case since August 2008.

Horn of Africa
* One new case was reported in Sudan this week, a WPV1 in Magwi,
Eastern Equatoria. This is the most recent case on the Horn of Africa,
with onset of paralysis on [20 Apr 2009]. The total number of cases in
the Horn of Africa for 2009 is now 51.
* The major risks associated with this outbreak are ongoing
transmission and further geographic spread within the affected
countries into the high transmission season; spread from southern
Sudan or northern Uganda further westward into northeastern DRC or
CAR, and further spread eastward, particularly to Somalia and Yemen.
* To minimize these risks, outbreak response activities were
conducted in Sudan (using mOPV1 in southern Sudan and tOPV/mOPV1 in
the north) on [27-29 Apr 2009], with further activities held in
southern Sudan on [26 May 2009] and a further round potentially to be
held in late June [2009].
* In Uganda, a NID (in conjunction with a measles campaign) using
tOPV is to be held from [6-8 Jun 2009]. Kenya held SNIDs from [23-27
May 2009] in key districts along the Rift Valley using mOPV1, with
another round planned for the end of June [2009]. Both Uganda and
Kenya also have plans for the addition of OPV to nationwide measles
activities during the course of 2009.
* Ethiopia held an SIA [supplementary immunization activity] in
high-risk areas from [22-25 May 2009] using mOPV1 and tOPV, with
another round planned in the Somali Region from [15 Jun 2009 and
mid-July 2009]. Eritrea held an SIA on [6 May 2009], its 1st since
December 2005, using tOPV; Somalia held an NID on [25 May 2009], while
Djibouti is planning an SIA for June [2009].
* Yemen is currently preparing plans for at least one NID in June 2009.

West Africa
* Two new cases were reported in Cote d'Ivoire in the past week,
both WPV1, from Bas Sassandra and Lagunes 2, with onset of paralysis
on [11 and 12 Apr 2009], respectively.
* Two new cases were reported in Benin this past week, both WPV1,
one each in Borgou and Zou, both with onset of paralysis in early
April [2009].
* And one new case was reported in Burkina Faso, a WPV1 in
Tenkodogo, with onset of paralysis on [2 Apr 2009].
* The total number of cases in west Africa for 2009 is now 62 from 7
countries (Benin, Burkina Faso, Cote d'Ivoire, Mali, Niger, Togo and
Guinea).
* A coordinated 11-country immunization activity will be held from
[29 May-2 Jun 2009], encompassing 9 infected countries (Nigeria,
Benin, Burkina Faso, Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, Mali, Niger, Togo and
Guinea) and 2 at-risk countries (Liberia and Sierra Leone), using
mOPV1, tOPV or mOPV3, depending on the risk and circumstances. A
further immunization activity will be held in Guinea -- probably in
conjunction with several neighboring countries -- in late June [2008].
* Following these rounds, any transmission in west Africa will be
responded to by large-scale mop-ups with monovalent OPV.

[To further highlight the challenges faced by the polio eradication
initiative, the multicountry West African initiative scheduled for 29
May through 2 Jun 2009 was cancelled in Benin, due to a strike of the
health sector (see
<http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/rwb.nsf/db900SID/MYAI-7SK66G?OpenDocument>
for details).

In the previous ProMED-mail polio update (Poliomyelitis - worldwide
(05) 20090521.1905), there was a newswire report of 13 cases in Kenya.
From the above information in the global polio case count from the
Polio Eradication Initiative website, the total number of cases
reported from Kenya is 10. It is unclear whether there is just a
reporting lag or the newswire in the earlier posting was erroneous.

The above newswire reports of 2 confirmed polio cases in different
districts in Uganda are disturbing, especially in the face of having
completed one NID and on the cusp of a 2nd NID, suggesting there
remain pockets of susceptibles in the country.

For a map of Uganda with districts, see
<http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/africa/uganda_pol_2005.jpg>. Moyo
district borders Sudan, and Pader district is to the west of Moyo
district, but one district to the south of the border with Sudan, and
one district to the west of the border with Kenya.
