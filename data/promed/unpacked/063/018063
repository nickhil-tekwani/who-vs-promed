[1] Panama Banana Blight Harmless to Humans

Panama Banana Blight Harmless to Humans
-----------------------------------------------
Local administrations in Haikou have opened ports to facilitate
banana business and avoid more losses, after news that "banana
cancer" swept most parts of China.
As the rumor of the "Panama Disease" outbreak in banana plantations
gradually quiets down, the local government has decided to give a
300-yuan subsidy [USD 37.5] for each banana truckload in an attempt
to boost fruit sales and reduce losses suffered by local banana
planters.
An agricultural expert says rumors saying "bananas cause cancer,"
which have spread widely on the Internet, are absolutely groundless.
Research fellow Chen Miancai of the Hainan Academy of Agricultural
Sciences clarified that a banana plant infected by disease cannot
bear fruit. Even it does, the fruit will not meet sales standards.
Bananas currently on sale are absolutely safe for human consumption.
The rumors began after Panama disease ravaged the country's main
Chinese banana-growing areas, especially in Guangdong province. It
has greatly affected the banana industry on the southern Chinese
island province of Hainan, according to Xinhua News Agency.
Bananas in Hainan have ripened since the end of March 2007. However,
fewer dealers are coming to purchase the fruit. Prices have also
sharply dropped from 3 yuan to 0.2 to 0.4 yuan per kilogram.
Millions of banana plants in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou,
capital of Guangdong Province, are being wiped out by Panama disease,
the Beijing News has reported.
The disease is encroaching on Guangdong's banana plantations by an
annual increase of 20 percent. So far, 3333 hectares -- 38.5 percent
of the total 8667 hectares -- of banana farms in Guangzhou have been
affected by the epidemic.
"The city's major banana production bases, including Fanyu, Zhongshan
and Nansha, are all infected. Millions of banana plants have died,
and unfortunately we have found no cure for the disease," said Liu
Shaoqin, a researcher with Guangzhou's Academy of Agricultural
Science.
In the early stages of infection, about 5 percent of the banana
plants on a farm will perish. A year later, 20 percent will be
infected and die. In the 3rd year, the percentage of infection will
soar to 50 percent, and the whole farm will be destroyed in just 4
years, according to Liu.
"The disease is the cancer of the plant community," he said.

[2] Ministry: Panama-disease-contracted bananas edible

The bananas which have contracted Panama disease are safe to eat,
said the Ministry of Agriculture yesterday [7 Apr 2007].
In the southern China province of Hainan, the price of bananas has
dropped dramatically after consumers were scared by misleading media
reports that described the disease as "SARS of the banana" and called
infected bananas "poisonous fruit."
An official with the ministry said the banana is a major cash plant
in South China and has won good reputation among consumers.
He said the country has grown 260 000 hectares of bananas and
produces nearly 7 million tons every year, ranking 3rd in the world.
The ministry has sent experts to major banana producing areas to
investigate the epidemic situation and help farmers to prevent the
disease, he said.
Panama disease, also called Banana Wilt, is a devastating disease
caused by a soil-inhabiting fungus species. It is widespread in Asia,
Africa, Australia, South America and many other regions.
So far, the world has no effective cure for the disease.
