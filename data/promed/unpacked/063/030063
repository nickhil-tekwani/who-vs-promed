Possible 2nd _E. coli_ source in Norway
---------------------------------------------
Norwegian health officials say a 2nd product by
Norwegian meat producer Gilde may be a source of
a recent outbreak of the _E. coli_ [O103 -
Mod.LL] bacterium. The Norwegian Institute of
Public Health earlier determined that the
Morpolse type of cured sausage from Gilde was the
source.
But now officials say Gilde salami was another
possible source of the bacterium that caused the
death of one child and left 18 people seriously
ill, Aftenposten reported.
"There is nothing in our material that indicates
that they were infected by Gilde's salami, but we
cannot rule it out either," NIPH director Preben
Aavitsland said.
