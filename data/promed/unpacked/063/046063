[As Trinidad is the only Caribbean island that has experienced yellow
fever in recent times, and there has been the recent report of a
primate die-off in Venezuela (Trinidad is just off the coast of
Venezuela) we have taken the decision to include this current report
under the ongoing thread of reports of yellow fever in South America.

More monkeys were being found dead in forests across the country,
according to Hunters Association president Mohan Bholasingh.

He said it was not known what was killing them and that the
association as a precautionary measure had sent out advisories
through members calling on hunters and other people entering forests
to be immunised with the yellow fever vaccine.

Red Howler monkeys are the hosts of the virus that carries the disease [virus].

And Honorary Game Warden Steve Mohammed told of another threat. He
said in recent weeks, especially during the Yuletide [Christmas]
season, monkeys, especially red howlers, were being killed for their
meat. He said the meat, which some regarded as exotic, was being sold
at [USD] 100-150 a pound. He said a number of the animals were found
with their heads and legs chopped off, an indication that they were
killed for their meat.

Agriculture Minister Arnold Piggott, who last week [week of 5 Jan
2009] said the ministry was investigating the mysterious deaths, told
the Express last Thursday [8 Jan 2009] that he had no further
information on the matter.

He recently told the Express the ministry was investigating the
discovery. He said: "I am hearing that our people found 5 skeletal
remains of what appears to be monkeys. They (remains) were taken for
an autopsy to be done."

He had said an autopsy by the Veterinary School at The Eric Williams
Medical Sciences Complex, Mt Hope was inconclusive because there were
not enough soft tissues on the remains of the animals found to
determine whether they were monkeys or another animal.

Bholasingh said last Thursday [8 Jan 2009]: "I cannot say what is
killing these monkeys, however, I am concerned with the number of
them dying, but all I can say there is something definitely wrong
with the monkey population."

He said they could be dying due to a lack of food, contaminated
water, or other pollutants. Until tests were carried out there was no
way to determine whether they had yellow fever, Bholasingh said.

He said, hunters found the skeletal remains of a monkey near the
Charuma River, near the Nariva Swamp on Thursday morning. "Hunters
are the eyes of the forest and they are the ones who bring in any
information to us about the monkeys," Bholasingh said.

During the past 5 weeks Bholasingh said dead monkeys were being
discovered near the Charuma River, Ecclesville Forest, Black Soil,
Poole Valley in Rio Claro, and many other areas. "They are dispersed
all over which makes it difficult to say the cause of death. If they
were dying in one area maybe we would have been able to determine the
cause of death," Bholasingh said.

Mohammed said: "According to my observation before the Christmas
season in the Ecclesville Forest, hunters were killing the monkeys
for their meat which they sold. When I visited the forest recently I
saw a couple of them with their heads and legs cut off lying on the
forest trails."

Mohammed said there was a ready market for monkey meat and that he
had never seen a sick monkey in the forest. But he said if they
became sick it could be because of the chemicals used by farmers to
spray their crops.

Bholasingh said: "If those monkeys are being hunted and are sold for
their meat by hunters they could be charged because the red howler
monkey is a protected animal and if hunters are hunting them they are
no longer called hunters but poachers."

[This report is confusing, as the monkey mortality may be due to
several factors, including yellow fever virus infection. Red howler
monkeys (_Alouatta seniculus_) are susceptible to YF virus and die of
the infection. Yellow fever virus infection is suspected in
neighboring Venezuela this month (January 2009) (see ProMED-mail
archive no. 20090122.0285). ProMED would appreciate receiving
additional information about red howler monkey mortality in Trinidad,
and any laboratory results, as they become available. ProMED thanks
Dr Calisher for sending in this report.
