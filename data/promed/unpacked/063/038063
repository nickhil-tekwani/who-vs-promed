The Netherlands is heading for a record number of infections with the meningococcal bacterium type [serogroup] W, also known as meningitis. So far this year [2018], 57 people ended up in intensive care, and 11 people died because of this bacterium, according to figures AD [Algemeen Dagblad, a Dutch daily newspaper based in Rotterdam] received from the national institute for public health RIVM [Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment].

The number of meningitis deaths so far this year [2018] is already equal to the total of 2017. To make matters worse, there is a shortage of vaccines, according to the newspaper. Last year [2017], the government decided that babies aged 14 months and primary school pupils need to be vaccinated against this dangerous variant of meningitis. But due to the vaccine shortage, 14-year-olds now have to wait until October 2018 for their vaccine.

According to AD, this variant of meningitis is rapidly advancing. No one died of meningococcal bacterium type [serogroup] W before 2015, and only about 4 people were infected each year. In the 1st 4 months of last year [2017], 27 people had to be hospitalized. In the same period of this year [2018], 50 people ended up in hospital due to this bacterium.

The 1st signs of a meningitis infection are cold- and flu-like symptoms. After that, things rapidly get worse. A clear sign of meningitis is a stiff neck. A person can die within 24 hours of being infected.

[The Dutch National Immunisation Programme has included the conjugated meningococcal serogroup C vaccine (MenC) at 14 months of age since 2002. In 2002, all 1-18-year-olds were vaccinated in a large catch up campaign. Subsequently, serogroup C meningococcal disease virtually disappeared, but since the autumn of 2015, there has been a rapid increase in serogroup W meningococcal disease (https://www.rivm.nl/bibliotheek/rapporten/2017-0031.pdf).

The incidence of meningococcal serogroup W disease increased more than 10-fold from 0.02 per 100 000 per year in the period 2005-2014 to 0.29 per 100 000 in 2016 in the Netherlands; in the last quarter of 2016, the incidence increased to 0.40 per 100,000 (https://www.rivm.nl/bibliotheek/rapporten/2017-0031.pdf). The proportion of serogroup W increased from 2.4% (48/2076 cases) in 2003-2014 to 10% (9/90) in 2015, and to 33% (50/151 cases) in 2016. In 2016, the incidence of serogroup W disease was highest in persons of 65 years or older (0.68 per 100 000), followed by the 15-24-year-olds (0.53 per 100 000) and under-5-year-olds (0.34 per 100 000). Most of the patients presented with sepsis (41%, n=21), 10 with meningitis (20%), and 3 with sepsis and meningitis (6%) (https://www.rivm.nl/bibliotheek/rapporten/2017-0031.pdf). The other patients had atypical presentations (n=17, 33%) including pneumonia (n=9), septic arthritis (n=2) and mild meningococcemia (n=6). Six patients died (case fatality rate of 11%).

Nevertheless, serogroup B is the most common cause of meningococcal disease in the Netherlands contributing to 70-80% of all meningococcal cases from 2011 to 2015 (https://www.rivm.nl/bibliotheek/rapporten/2017-0031.pdf). In 2016, however, only 50% of all cases were caused by serogroup B because of the increase in serogroup W disease. Serogroup B affects, in particular, young children and, to a lesser extent, adolescents and young adults.

The case fatality rate for serogroup W disease (11% in NL, 12% in UK) and the percentage of patients with sepsis (41% in NL, 49% in UK) and an atypical presentation (33% in NL, 22% in UK) in the Netherlands and the UK are rather similar. Also, the age distribution, with most cases among the elderly and a high incidence in adolescents, is similar in the Netherlands and the UK. The serogroup W isolates in England in 2014-2015 were predominantly a hypervirulent genotype, PorB serotype 2a, a surrogate marker for clonal complex 11, and strongly related to finetype P1.5,2:F1-1, which is the finetype causing the majority of serogroup W cases in the Netherlands (https://www.rivm.nl/bibliotheek/rapporten/2017-0031.pdf). Clonal complex 11 is also responsible for the current serogroup W outbreaks in South America.

Because of the continuing rapid increase in the UK in serogroup W disease, the UK replaced the adolescent MenC conjugate vaccine for 13-14-year-olds with the quadrivalent MenACWY conjugate vaccine in the autumn of 2015. In addition, catch up campaigns were set up to give the MenACWY vaccine to all 13-18-year-olds and new university admissions during 2015 to 2017 (https://www.rivm.nl/bibliotheek/rapporten/2017-0031.pdf).

Neither MenB nor MenACWY vaccination were included in the Dutch National Immunisation Programme, but were under consideration. However, as of May 2018, the MenACWY vaccination replaces MenC vaccination at age 14 months and from October 2018, 13-14 year-olds will be offered MenACWY vaccination (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5915972/). A detailed discussion of these issues in the Netherlands appears in a publication "Meningococcal disease in the Netherlands. Background information for the Health Council. RIVM Report 2017-0031 M.J.Knol et al," which is available at https://www.rivm.nl/bibliotheek/rapporten/2017-0031.pdf. Much of the above information has been extracted from this publication. - Mod.ML
