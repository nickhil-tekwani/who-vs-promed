New Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone raises fears of new infection chain
----------------------------------------------------------------------
A fresh outbreak of Ebola in a part of Sierra Leone where the virus was thought to have been contained has raised fears of a new, uncontrolled infection chain that could send the death toll soaring. Koinadugu had prided itself on being the only area to have kept Ebola at bay by operating self-imposed quarantine system. A Red Cross ambulance team was sent to the remote district of Koinadugu, which had prided itself on being the only area to have kept Ebola at bay, on Tuesday [4 Nov 2014] to urgently collect 30 corpses for medical burial.

The outbreak is a major setback for the Ebola response force and the district, which 2 weeks ago remained resolved to control the spread of the virus. Koinadugu has been operating a self-imposed quarantine for 4 months, thanks to the intervention of an expat businessman, Momah Konte, who returned from Washington and worked with local officials and tribal chiefs to try to prevent the spread. The Red Cross said the emergency burial team was making the 5-hour journey from Freetown on Tuesday to collect the bodies in the Nenie chiefdom east of the district's capital Kabala. A spokesman said that there were reports of a further 25 ill with Ebola and another 255 being monitored after coming into contact with the dead and the sick.

The district, which is home to more than 260 000 people, borders on Guinea, where the current outbreak started. It is populated by many remote villages with the movement of traders and farmers difficult to control. The disease is widespread in the nearby districts of Bombali and Port Loko, where the Ebola response has been hampered by lack of resources. There are no treatment centres in either district.

There were local reports that Ebola had been brought to the district by an infected man who had travelled to the Eastern Province of Sierra Leone for a funeral. The national Ebola 117 hotline says it is getting reports of 4 cases a day from the district, which is about 5 hours from Freetown. The fresh outbreak comes days after a presidential visit to the neighbouring district of Port Loko, where bodies were left in houses and on verandahs for days before the Red Cross collected them 9 days ago.

A Cuban medical team had been on standby for weeks in Freetown to operate a new clinic in Port Loko but its opening was delayed after an unconnected NGO international pulled out of the plan to manage it.

The emergence of a new outbreak of Ebola comes as fresh figures show that Ebola is spreading 9 times faster in parts of Sierra Leone than it was 2 months ago. A report by the Africa Governance Initiative [AGI], set up by Tony Blair, which is supporting the country's Ebola 117 hotline says there were 12 new cases a day in late October [2014] in the rural areas surrounding the capital Freetown, compared with an average of 1.3 cases in early September [2014]. The head of the call centre told the Guardian the call centre was getting 4 cases a day reported from Koinadugu.

[2] West Africa: faith group awareness initiative

Ebola awareness initiative
--------------------------
Faith leaders across West Africa are using their unique position of influence within communities to speak out and help stop the spread of the deadly Ebola virus. CAFOD [Catholic Agency For Overseas Development], Christian Aid, Tearfund and World Vision are working through established religious networks across Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone to educate communities about the symptoms of Ebola, offer support to people affected by the outbreak and ensure survivors are not stigmatised when they return home.

With most public gatherings banned across the affected countries, places of worship are one of the few locations where people can receive vital information about the Ebola outbreak. The authority of faith leaders allows them to play a vital role in challenging the myths and misinformation surrounding the virus and offer life-saving advice to their church or mosque congregations on Ebola protection and prevention methods. Churches and ecumenical groups have also been donating essential food and hygiene supplies to all at-risk families.

Present traditional funeral practices have been highlighted as one of the activities which increase the rates of the continued spread of the disease. As a result, agencies are working with Christian and Muslim leaders to teach communities what modifications of cultural practices would reduce risks of transmission but allow safe but dignified burials.

CAFOD is working with priests, imams and traditional faith leaders to spread the word about hand-washing and safe sanitation and distribute hygiene kits. Its church partners are promoting safe burials and supplying food to vulnerable families. CAFOD is targeting 54 000 people in Liberia, 129 000 in Sierra Leone, and 28 000 in Guinea....

MCSL [Methodist Church Sierra Leone] and other denominations are members of the Council of Churches in Sierra Leone, which has set up a national Religious Leaders' Taskforce on Ebola. Christian and Muslim leaders on this taskforce are collaborating with other partners to provide food to vulnerable households and offer psychosocial care to health workers, affected families and children under quarantine....

Tearfund is working with over 1000 churches in Sierra Leone to improve awareness of how to stop the virus spreading. Radio stations run by Tearfund partners have been broadcasting life-saving health messages, reaching hundreds of thousands of listeners....

Again, in Sierra Leone, World Vision has reached out to 30 key faith leaders in churches and mosques that serve large local populations to help tackle stigma. Through a consortium with other aid agencies it plans to reach over 8000 faith leaders and key community figures, with a potential to influence over 1.5 million people. As well as providing burial teams that are fully equipped to safely deal with victims, World Vision staff have been advising Christian and Muslim leaders on how to best tailor burial practices to prevent the risk of infection....

David Thomson, Director of Policy and Programming for World Vision UK, said: "We have strong ties to faith communities, having worked with both Christian and Muslim leaders to support our development work in the past. This allows us to disseminate health promotion messages through faith communities more rapidly and more effectively, drawing on the additional influence and trust they have amongst local populations." ... -- more

[3] Models overestimate cases/deaths

Models overestimate Ebola cases
-------------------------------
Rate of infection in Liberia seems to plateau, raising questions over the usefulness of models in an outbreak. The reality of the Ebola outbreak is not reflected by model projections of high case numbers. The Ebola outbreak in West Africa has infected at least 13 567 people and killed 4951, according to figures released on 31 Oct [2014] by the World Health Organization (WHO). Now, in a rare encouraging sign, the number of new cases in Liberia seems to be flattening after months of exponential growth. Scientists say it is too soon to declare that the disease is in retreat: case data are often unreliable, and Ebola can be quick to resurge. But it is clear that mathematical models have failed to accurately project the outbreak's course.

Researchers are now struggling to understand whether reports of empty beds at treatment centres and declining burial numbers are signs that fewer people are developing Ebola, or whether cases and deaths are going unrecorded. In Liberia's capital, Monrovia, just 80 of 250 beds were filled at the Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) centre last week. But Fasil Tezera, who heads MSF's Liberia mission, is cautious: "The present epidemic is unpredictable," he says.

Epidemiologists normally use mathematical models to estimate the trajectory of an outbreak, and to estimate where and how to direct scarce medical resources. But for the current crisis, on-the-ground data contradict the projections of published models, says Neil Ferguson, an epidemiologist at Imperial College London, and a member of the WHO's multidisciplinary Ebola Response Team.

On 7 Oct 2014, for example, modeller Alessandro Vespignani of Northeastern University in Boston, Massachusetts [USA], and his collaborators predicted that Liberia would see 6900-34 400 cases by 24 Oct 2014, and 9400-47 000 by 31 Oct 2014. But the WHO put the number of reported cases in the country at just 6535 as of 25 Oct 2014.

Vespignani says that his model was a worst-case scenario, in which exponential growth of cases continued and containment measures were ineffective. But he and other modellers are also handicapped by incomplete and unreliable data on Ebola epidemiology, especially in the hardest-hit areas. And they have little empirical data on how disease-control measures quantitatively affect Ebola transmission, says ecologist Nick Golding, who studies the spatial distribution of disease at the University of Oxford, UK. Models "are fitted to pretty poor-quality data on case counts, and essentially no data on interventions," he says, making it difficult to generate accurate projections.

2 more-complex models published last month [October 2014] attempted to tease out the effects of various control measures. But their outcomes also do not square with the most recent Liberia data. That does not surprise Alison Galvani, an epidemiologist at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut [USA], and an author of both studies. "Epidemics are moving targets," she says, adding that her model projections are at best a preliminary outline for public-health intervention. Because the model projections can be easily misunderstood, Ferguson says that modellers "really need to think carefully about what we really know about Ebola transmission and the impact of different interventions, and do our best to communicate the many uncertainties."

In the meantime, Bruce Aylward, a WHO assistant director-general who is coordinating the agency's Ebola efforts, is "terrified" that any plateau in new cases will be misinterpreted as meaning that the problem is going away. There is still a need to greatly increase the resources available to treat infected people and prevent new cases, Aylward says.

But if the slowing rate of infection in Liberia is confirmed, it could suggest that even moderate levels of public-health intervention can pay off, says Golding. For the current Ebola outbreak, the average number of new cases spawned by an infected individual (1.2-2.2) is much lower than that of many other communicable diseases, such as measles (which can spread to between 12 and 18 people per case). As Ebola prevention measures push down this figure, the disease becomes easier to control; when it dips below 1, virus spread stops completely.

Until the West African outbreak is extinguished, there is a real risk that the disease will resurge in areas where it has been stamped out -- or even cover new ground. A stark reminder of this came in the past 2 weeks: a 2-year-old girl with Ebola travelled hundreds of kilometres from Guinea to Mali on a bus -- raising concerns that the many people she came into contact with could spark outbreaks in Mali.

[In normal circumstances, models are useful for projecting future requirements for personnel, equipment and supplies. But in this outbreak, case reporting criteria have been constantly shifting and it hasn't been possible to carry out household surveys with laboratory confirmation of cases and deaths, or even lab confirmation for many of the cases classified as suspicious and probable. Given the high incidence of malaria and other fatal diseases, it has been impossible to arrive at realistic projections of the past and future case loads and mortality.

For a geographical perspective on Ebola, these maps show how small the Ebola-infected part of Africa is compared with much of the rest of the world: http://kuow.org/post/twitter-snark-helps-put-geography-ebola-stark-relief. - Mod.JW
