Kansas State University scientist Dallas Seifers has found a virus
never before detected in wheat.
"We just found it in this year's growing season," said Seifers, who
is a wheat researcher at the university's agricultural research
center in Hays, Kansas.
Although the virus was found in multiple locations around the state
last spring, including university fields and privately-owned land,
there was no indication that it had a significant yield impact on the
2006 wheat crop, he said.
Once Seifers discovered the disease, he worked through several
processes to rule out other known diseases before reaching the
conclusion that this one was a new one.
The virus, which Seifers is calling triticum mosaic virus, seems to
have affected cultivars that have been developed for their resistance
to wheat streak mosaic, he said.
Visually, the virus's disease symptoms resemble several other
viruses, including wheat streak mosaic.
There are still many unknowns about the disease, Seifers said,
including what impact it might have on yields in coming years, how
widespread it was in 2006 and what sort of weather conditions it
favors. "We're looking for answers to those questions and more," he said.
Many crop researchers spend their whole careers without discovering a
disease, but this is Seifers' 3rd find. He also discovered what is
now called High Plains virus and Wheat Yellow Head virus.

[The cereal crop plant wheat, _Triticum aestivum_ L. subsp.
_aestivum_ and _T. durum_ (durum wheat), develops symptoms of the
disease mosaic, when infected by Triticum mosaic virus.
Common viral diseases of wheat in the USA include those caused by
barley yellow dwarf virus (aphid vectors), the high plains virus
(mite vector), soil-borne wheat mosaic virus (fungus vector), wheat
spindle streak mosaic virus (fungus vector) and wheat streak mosaic
virus (mite vector). More than 30 viruses are listed as infecting
wheat in an APS online compendium of disease names (see link on
viruses of wheat). There are over 50 postings in ProMED-mail
archives on some of these viruses using the search terms wheat and
virus, too many to list.
The new virus described in this report appears to be another entry to
an already long list of viruses infecting wheat. The nature of the
virus and its mode of transmission are not described in this report,
and the impact on wheat production seems low at the present time. It
does not seem to be restricted in its distribution in Kansas however,
implying other states in the USA may encounter it in the future.
