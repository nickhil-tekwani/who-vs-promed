32 tainted private water wells hint at source of island's illness
-------------------------------------------------
More than 30 residential wells on South Bass Island have tested positive
for total coliform bacteria, leading state officials to intensify their
focus on water contamination as a possible source of a mysterious illness
outbreak that has sickened more than 1300 people.
Jay Carey, a spokesman for the Ohio Department of Health, said yesterday,
Wed, 1 Sep 2004, that 32 of 42 private wells tested by the Ottawa County
Health Department contained total coliform, which could indicate the
presence of more serious bacteria or pathogens.
Of those 32 wells, 11 also were found to be contaminated with _E. coli_,
Mr. Carey said. _E. coli_ in drinking water is a possible indicator of
fecal contamination.
The tests, done over the past 2 weeks by county health authorities, are in
addition to sampling done by the Ohio EPA at 17 wells used by businesses
and public facilities on the island. Of those wells, 11 have tested
positive for total coliform, with 4 also found to have _E. coli_ present.
The Ohio EPA has ordered the owners of those 11 wells to stop using them.
"It's starting to look like there's a generalized water problem," said
Patricia Madigan, a spokesman for the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency.
Mr. Carey said health officials have not confirmed a source or cause of the
outbreak but believe the well test results could point toward one. "We
can't say it's the cause yet, but we may be looking in the right
direction," he said. "It's beginning to confirm the suspicion of widespread
groundwater contamination."
The number of laboratory-confirmed cases remained at 24, including
instances of campylobacter infection, norovirus, salmonella, and
giardiasis. However, investigators continue to uncover new cases of the
illness, which typically includes vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and
chills.
"We do have recent infection," Mr. Carey said. "We have someone who began
experiencing symptoms [Tue, 31 Aug 2004]."
The county health department is testing residential wells at the request of
customers and has "fewer than a dozen" wells still to test, Mr. Carey said.
He said it was unclear how many residential wells are on the island. Ms.
Madigan said the EPA has taken samples from all of the publicly used wells
on the island.
All businesses on the island with wells have been ordered to have them
tested weekly. Ms. Madigan said those that have tested positive for total
coliform or _E. coli_ must undergo further tests before they can be used
again. "They need to get 2 clean samples in a row and then they can use the
water again," she said.
EPA inspectors are trying to get usable follow-up samples from 4
businesses, 3 of which have tested positive for total coliform, Ms. Madigan
said. "They're worried about the wells, and they're over-chlorinating them
and we can't get valid samples," she said.
The affected businesses are all outside the village of Put-in-Bay, a
popular Lake Erie tourist destination which has a municipal water and sewer
system. EPA tests have found no contamination or malfunctions in the
village's system.
The area of South Bass Island outside Put-in-Bay village is Put-in-Bay
Township, which has no public water system. Township residents rely on
wells for their drinking water.

--------------------------------------------------

of 1426 people who have a history of gastrointestinal illness and travel to

Has anyone checked the ice consumed on the boats and island? Ice holding
areas and ice machines can become contaminated or an improper machine drain
tube can cause problems. Commerical-type ice tea brewers have also been
found contaminated with coliforms.

[The number of reported symptomatic individuals continues to grow; new
cases appear to be continuing. Contaminated water certainly appears to be
involved, and how so many wells became contaminated is not yet clear.
Dr. Barrett's point regarding ice is worthwhile considering in the mix. -
