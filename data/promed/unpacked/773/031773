Hong Kong schools shut due to flu outbreaks
-------------------------------------------
Hong Kong's top health official announced here yesterday night [Wed 12 Mar
2008] that all primary schools, special schools and kindergartens in the
city will close for 2 weeks starting from today, due to seasonal flu
outbreaks. Dr York Chow, secretary for Food and Health of Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR) government made the announcement after the
Department of Health and the Bureau of Education met last night to review
the data of the flu and the response of parents.

"We made the decision given the rising trend of flu infections within the
community as the flu peak is expected to continue for weeks," Chow told
reporters. "We hope such precautionary measures will help reduce the cross
infection of the flu virus in schools and the community." On yesterday
morning, Chow said that an expert group will do its best to investigate the
recent deaths of 3 children with flu-like symptoms, adding that at this
stage, no common factors have been identified. He said the most important
thing at the moment is to grasp a clear picture of the outbreaks and
whether they are spreading.

Yesterday, the Center for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of
Health (DH) received reports of influenza-like illness (ILI) outbreaks
affecting 23 schools involving a total of 184 people. A CHP spokesman said
ILI may be caused by influenza or other respiratory viruses. CHP's
officials have visited all these institutions and provided health advice to
the staff accordingly. CHP will provide the public with information on
seasonal influenza starting today. A hotline will operate from 9am to 6pm.
from Monday to Friday.

CHP received a report from Hospital Authority yesterday concerning a 3 year
old boy who was admitted to Princess Margaret Hospital Tuesday because of
persistent fever, cough and shortness of breath. The boy was transferred to
Intensive Care Unit and is now in stable condition, said the spokesman,
adding that initial investigation showed his respiratory sample yielded
positive results for influenza A (H1N1). Further tests are under progress.

Regarding the death of a 7 year old boy with respiratory and neurological
symptoms in Tuen Mun Hospital, the spokesman said further laboratory tests
showed that the boy's respiratory sample yielded positive results for
influenza A (H1N1) [see the following report for modification of this
diagnosis. - Mod.CP].

On the death of a 21 month old boy who passed away on 24 Feb 2008, the
spokesman said that examination of the boy's respiratory sample yielded
negative results for Influenza A and B. "There is no evidence at the
present stage suggesting the boy has contracted influenza. Further
investigation is ongoing," he said.

The Hospital Authority (HA) on Wednesday [12 Mar 2008] announced that a
special fund of 20 million HK dollars (2.6 million USD) had been set aside
to implement a series of measures run up to the end of April 2008 to cope
with recent surge in demand for public hospital services due to seasonal
influenza.

Public hospitals have been experiencing a prolonged increase in emergency
demand lately, in particular the emergency medical admissions, HA chief
executive Shane Solomon told the media during a visit to the North District
Hospital yesterday afternoon.

"Compared with February last year, the daily number of emergency medical
admissions is 16 percent higher. At the same time, recent admission to
pediatric wards in public hospitals has also surged," he said. The sudden
and unprecedented surge in demand in medical and pediatric wards has
created great pressure on the front line staff, who have worked extra
hours, with many of them canceling leave, working longer hours and on their
days off, he said. "Over the last 2 weeks, an additional 15 000 hours of
extra nursing and supporting staff have worked, adding the equivalent of
192 full-time staff to the ward," he said.

To cope with the recent surge, various hospital clusters have opened extra
beds and implemented other initiatives to cope with patient needs. Solomon
also reassured the public that the HA will closely monitor the situation on
a daily basis to plan for further measures.

Flu viruses found in Hong Kong victim
-------------------------------------
Experts in Hong Kong found 2 flu viruses and a steroid inside the body of a
boy who died of influenza in an outbreak that has forced the closure of all
kindergartens and primary schools in the special administrative region
(SAR). The city's Department of Health found the H1 and H3 viruses and
components of a steroid after examining the body of the 7 year old boy,
GuangzhouDaily reported today [Fri 14 Mar 2008].

A 3 year old girl also died of the flu early this month, following the
death of a 2 year old child at the end of February 2008. Hong Kong health
officials have reported 9 confirmed flu cases and 65 suspected ones since 6
Mar 2008, mostly at schools, in the territory of nearly 7 million.
Scientists suspected that the 7 year old had taken a steroid to treat his
asthma, which weakened his immune system, the report said. The boy's death
report is not likely to come out soon, the report said. But scientists have
already ruled out the possibility of bird flu or severe acute respiratory
syndrome, an epidemic that killed hundreds of people in Hong Kong in 2003.

Yuen Kwok-yung, a leading Hong Kong scientist, and a panel of experts
studied the 2 deceased flu patients and found that the flu virus had not
spread beyond their lungs, which suggested the virus was not too virulent.
The World Health Organization also said yesterday that there was no reason
for concern. WHO spokesman Peter Cordingley called the Hong Kong outbreak
"just regular seasonal flu."

Late on Wednesday [12 Mar 2008] the Hong Kong government ordered all
kindergartens, primary and special education schools to close for 2 weeks
effective yesterday. This move was reminiscent of measures taken during
Hong Kong's outbreak ofSARS. The closure in effect starts the Easter
holiday for schools about a week in advance. It will affect nearly 560 000
students at 1745 schools. Many schools have required students to wear masks
since the outbreak occurred nearly 2 weeks ago [see a photograph
accompanying the original text of part [1]. - Mod.CP].

[These reports indicate that the Hong Kong SAR is experiencing a serious
outbreak of seasonal influenza. The deaths of 2 of 3 affected children has
caused the health care authorities to close Hong Kong's kindergarten and
primary schools for a period of 2 weeks. Two of the children were
seropositive for H1N1 influenza virus. The unusual feature of this report
is that one of the 2 H1N1 seropositive children was also seropositive for
H3N2 influenza virus. This latter child was receiving steroid treatment and
it is suggested that his immune system had been weakened and he was more
susceptible to infection. If so it indicates that both H1N1 and H3N2
viruses are circulating in the outbreak of seasonal influenza in Hong Kong.
Details of the diagnostic testing are not provided, however, and it may be
that a response to vaccine virus is being measured if the child had been
vaccinated recently. More information is awaited. - Mod.CP]
