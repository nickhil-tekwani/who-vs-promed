A viral disease identified by agricultural experts as "poppy" has hit a
major part of paddy crops in Thul taluka [Jacobabad district, Sindh]
throwing the farmers into limbo.
Talking to Dawn, MPA (member of the provincial assembly) Mir Nasir Khan
Khoso said that the disease, which dries the leaves of the paddy crop, is
contagious. He said that the disease has caused 30 per cent damage to Irri
and 50 per cent to Basmati, cited as cash crops for the country.
He said that no fruitful results could be achieved despite spray of almost
all types of pesticides including poisonous ones against the fast spreading
disease. The worst affected included agricultural fields in deh Madadpur,
deh Sarki, and deh Korar, he added.
He said that the disease could not be controlled despite implementation of
proposals and suggestions of the agriculture experts and it was increasing
with each passing day. He also complained of non-serious attitude of the
local authorities in containing the disease.

[The name "poppy" for a disease of rice is obviously local and not recorded
in any official sources. There are at least 15 viruses known to affect rice
with a number of insect vectors involved. Many rice viruses have become
serious problems since rice cultivation has been intensified, and it is
possible that a virus problem has arisen in the area.
However, the report of a "viral" cause may be an error and this report may
in fact refer to bacterial leaf blight which has broken out in other parts
of Sindh and Punjab. Bacterial leaf blight (BLB) of rice is caused by
_Xanthomonas oryzae_ pv. _oryzae_. Severely infected leaves tend to dry
quickly (like the symptoms described above). Disease management relies
mostly on cultural practices and use of resistant host cultivars. For more
information on BLB and the recent outbreak in Pakistan see ProMED-mail post
20071005.3293.
Chemical treatments are reported to have failed in the affected area. This
scenario would fit either BLB or a virus: chemicals are usually not very
effective for control of BLB, and in case of a virus they would only be
effective if a potential insect vector was involved.
The International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) has developed a number of
rice varieties and hybrids (_indica x japonica_ subspecies) suitable for a
range of growing conditions. It is not stated which particular cultivars
are grown in the affected area. Basmati is a long grain rice for which
India and Pakistan are the largest producers worldwide. Basmati plants are
delicate, prone to breaking, and have a relatively low yield, but produce
high quality grains.
