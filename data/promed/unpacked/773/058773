A 2nd person in New York State has died from eastern equine encephalitis. The Oswego County Health Department says the adult in the town of Albion, in Oswego County, died after being hospitalized with the illness.

Eastern equine encephalitis [EEE] is a rare, but serious, viral infection that is transmitted through bites from infected mosquitoes.

You can lower your risk by staying inside at dawn or dusk, which is when mosquitoes are most active. Experts also say to wear insect repellent and make sure doors and windows have tight-fitting screens to keep mosquitoes out.

[It is a bit unusual to have 2 human EEE cases in a single county within 2 weeks.

As noted with the earlier EEE human case in Oswego county, New York State (ProMED-mail archive no. 20150926.3671974), EEE virus is endemic along the Gulf Coast, Eastern Seaboard, and as far west as the Upper Midwestern states of the USA. Several equine EEE cases have occurred also in New York State this year (2015).

Wild birds are the reservoir hosts, and the black-tailed mosquito, _Culiseta melanura_, is the vector in swamps. Other mosquito species may act as bridge vectors, carrying the virus out of swamps into adjoining localities and transmitting the virus to humans and equine animals. Clinical cases in humans are very serious, with a case fatality rate of 33 per cent and significant neurological sequelae in those who survive the infection (see http://www.cdc.gov/EasternEquineEncephalitis). Although human infections are rare, it is prudent to follow the recommendations given above to avoid mosquito bites until killing frosts eliminate mosquito vectors and halt transmission.
