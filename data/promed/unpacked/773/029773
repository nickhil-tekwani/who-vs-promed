Morristown Horse Had EEE
------------------------
A horse found dead in the Town of Morristown tested positive for Eastern Equine Encephalitis, (EEE) a deadly, mosquito-borne disease, according to Susan Hathaway, St. Lawrence County public health director. The horse was found in a field on 23 Jul 2012. The positive test result came back Wednesday [25 Jul 2012], Hathaway said.

This death is the 1st horse death from EEE in St. Lawrence County this year. One horse was euthanized after testing positive for the disease last August [2011], and the county also had a case in 2009.

Though EEE has historically stopped in northern Onondaga and Oswego counties, for the most part, rising concern over the disease prompted a vaccination clinic for horses in Heuvelton in June. Hathaway says horses should be vaccinated and contact with mosquitoes should be avoided by removing standing water from your property (mosquitoes breed in standing water) and by wearing appropriate clothing and repellent.

The disease causes a swelling of part of the brain and is often fatal. Last year, a 4-year-old Oswego County girl died from EEE. In a statement, St. Lawrence County Public Health points out mosquitoes carrying both EEE and West Nile disease have been found in the state.

[This is an expensive disease in horses -- it readily kills -- but is highly preventable. To quote my colleague Tam Garland, "It is so sad that people cannot remember from year to year to vaccinate their horses. This is a preventable disease, as there are vaccines. The vaccine is effective, and often combined with West Nile virus, another disease transmitted by mosquitoes which can be fatal to horses. When the vaccine to prevent EEE is used in horses, it is recommended to be given every 6 months in areas that are prone to the disease, such as the eastern states of the US or those that border the gulf."

And 2 things we have noted down here in Louisiana where it is a constant risk each year. For those of you interested in its epidemiology ... vaccinated horses make ideal sentinels. Just bleed them every time you revaccinate them and run titres. Those that have not been exposed in the previous 6-9 months just have the usual post-vaccination (low) titre. But if they were bitten by virus carrying mosquitoes they have super raised titres thanks to having been previously vaccinated. In this way you can measure exposure and virus activity.

And something I frequently discussed with our late state epidemiologist Louise MacFarland is the essential absence of severe clinical human cases of EEE. We don't see deaths and in the last 30 or so years I know of only a couple with permanent damage. I think it is because we have only a few weeks each year without mosquitoes and so have a high degree of human herd-immunity. That will not be the case in New England. - Mod.MHJ
