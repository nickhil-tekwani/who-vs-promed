Bluetongue in Western Europe - Some updates
-------------------------------------------
Numbers of BTV-8 infections have again surged during the last couple
of days. An update on case numbers notified by the authorities can be
found at the EU-ADNS website
<http://ec.europa.eu/food/animal/diseases/adns/table_11_2007/adns_140907_en.pdf>.
In addition, information of member states affected were presented at
the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health (SCFCAH)
meeting (11-12 Sep 2007) and are available at
<http://ec.europa.eu/food/committees/regulatory/scfcah/animal_health/index_en.htm>.
A press release issued by the Dutch, Belgian and German farmers
unions states that a coordinated action within the affected member
states is essential in terms of a future vaccination policy and
related trade issues. As disease-related losses of the livestock
industry are increasing, the unions are urging the EU Commission and
the respective governments to support the development of a safe,
inactivated vaccine against BTV-8 as quickly as possible.
The organisations welcome a draft setting the frame for EU-wide
harmonized legislation on bluetongue. In the light of the spread of
the virus, protection of yet uninfected regions in other parts of
Europe should become a priority.
