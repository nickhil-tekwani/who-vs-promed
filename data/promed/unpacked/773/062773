Spotted fever in Brazil - background
------------------------------------
Rickettsial spotted fever was 1st reported in Brazil in 1920. The disease
is known locally as "Brazilian spotted fever" and "Febre maculosa
brasileira". Cases are reported in Minas Gerais, Rio de Janeiro, Bahia,
Goias, Rio Grande do Sul, and Espirito Santo.

Seroprevalence surveys: 10.6 per cent of healthy students and 4.11 per cent
of dogs in the endemic areas of Minas Gerais (1998), 77.3 per cent of
horses and 31.3 per cent of dogs in Pedreira Municipality, Sao Paulo State
(2001) 1.6 per cent of healthy persons in Minas Gerais (2005 publication).
Outbreaks were reported in Minas Gerais during 1929 to 1944, but not during
1945 to 1980.

Subsequent outbreaks were reported in Minas Gerais in 1981, 1984, 1992,
1995, and 2000. 92 cases (40 per cent fatal) were confirmed in Minas Gerais
during 1981 to 1989; 78 during 1992 to 1997 (including 3 fatal cases in
1996, and 2 in 1997). 17 cases (8 fatal) were reported in Pedreira county,
Sao Paulo during 1985 to 1995. 5 fatal cases were reported in Sao Paulo
State in 2003. 8 outbreaks were reported in Sao Paulo State during 2005.

The principal vectors are _Amblyomma aureolatum_ (areas of Sao Paulo) and
_A. cajennense_. _A. cooperi_ has also been implicated (in Sao Paulo). 1.3
per cent of A. cajennense in Minas Gerais carry the organism. Spotted
fever-group rickettsiae have been found in _Rhipicephalus sanguineus_ in
Rio de Janeiro state.

_Rickettsia parkeri_ has been identified in 9.7 per cent of A. triste (a
non-human biting tick) in Pauliceia County, Sao Paulo (2005). _R. parkeri_
antibodies have been documented in dogs from urban areas in the western
Brazilian Amazon. (Monte Negro, Rondonia). The principal reservoir hosts
are capybara (_Hydrochaeris hydrochaeris_),horses, and occasionally dogs.

Notable outbreaks:
2004 - An outbreak (3 fatal cases) was reported in Maua (Grande Sao Paulo).
2005 - An outbreak (7 cases, 2 fatal) was reported in a mountain resort
near Rio de Janeiro.
