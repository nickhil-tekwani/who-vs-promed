Officials have closed Costa Rica's Corcovado National Park, a prime tourist
attraction, because animals there are dying. The dead include monkeys,
toucans, and sloths. The last time monkeys started dying on such a massive
scale in the park was in the 1950s, said Edwardo Carrillo, the head
researcher in the investigative team that is looking into the deaths. The
culprit then was yellow fever, he said. But yellow fever does not affect birds.
Carillo said that perhaps as many as half of the monkey population at the
park have died. The location is a peninsula in south west Costa Rica in
Central America. The park is 110 000 acres and contains 4 species of monkeys.
Initially, officials tried to [downplay] the situation. In signing the
order for the park's closure on 3 Dec 2005, director Alvaro Ugalde would
say no more than that animals were dying, though he didn't know how many.
As a result, the park was being closed until officials found out why, he
said. The closing got very little publicity.
A team of biologists and health investigators took specimens and blood
samples from the dead creatures and sent them to Texas and elsewhere for
examination. Results are not back yet.
Federico Solorzano, who works with the Fundacion Corcovado, a promotional
group, advanced one possible explanation. Costa Rica's May-to-November
rainy season has just ended. It was nastier than most because of backlash
from the record Atlantic hurricane season. Rains devastated communities
throughout the Pacific as far south as the Osa Peninsula on which the park
sits. Those rains may have also ruined the development of the fruit that
monkeys and birds feast on, Solorzano speculated. The animals may be
starving to death.
Mario Gonzalez, a 70 year old farmer on the Osa [Peninsula], agreed that
starvation may be the case. In his 50 years on the Osa, there had been
seasons where a larger quantity of rain had fallen, but never with such
force, he said. In addition, he noted that it seemed as if animals were
venturing out of the park more frequently this year, maybe in search of
food, he ventured. Carrillo, after visiting the Osa Peninsula, said that
although toucans had been dying off the birds have not been dying at such a
high rate as that of their tree-swinging counterparts. When pressed, he
wouldn't estimate a number or a percentage of dead birds.
Dr Maria del Rocio Saenz Madrigal, the nation's health minister, noted that
migratory birds come to the area, including some from Canada. She said
there was no increase in illnesses among humans, according to those health
workers operating clinics in the area. Many types of illnesses and viral
diseases can be spread by mosquitoes and other insects, [both] plentiful in
the rain forest.
The research team is made up of 8 experts from Costa Rica's health and
environmental ministries as well as the Universidad de Costa Rica and the
Universidad Nacional. Carrillo said they should know by 20 Dec 2005 what is
killing all the animals. Though it would seem that the closure of the park
would be devastating for tourism, hotel owners weren't reporting many
cancellations or early departures. The high tourist season is just
beginning in balmy Costa Rica.
If officials find out what is killing animals before 20 Dec, and that cause
is non-threatening to humans, then the park will open back up, Solorzano
said. But until then, the park, which is known for its diversity of plants
and animals, will remain closed to the public.
The park is a refuge for many kinds of wildlife. Tourists face primitive
conditions and frequently camp on the ground. But the peninsula also is a
haven for fishermen and surfers, plus dolphin and whale watchers.

[It seems unusual for such a variety of animals to be dying. Although it
could be a disease, starvation also makes sense. If anyone has some
authoritative information on this situation, we would appreciate receiving
it. - Mod.TG]
