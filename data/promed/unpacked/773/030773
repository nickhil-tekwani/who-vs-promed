------------------------------------

Date of confirmation of the event: 17 Aug 2016
Reason for notification: emerging disease
Morbidity: 0.33 per cent
Mortality: 0.33 per cent

Causal agent: Monkeypox virus

New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks: total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1: Mefou Primate Sanctuary, Mfou, Mefou et Afamba, Centre
Date of start of the outbreak: 15 Aug 2016
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: natural park
Affected animals:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Common chimpanzee: _Pan troglodytes_ (Hominidae) / 300 / 1 / 1 / 0 / 0
Affected population: The group of 22 chimpanzees (dead animal included) used to live in a 3-hectares enclosure isolated from the other compartments of the sanctuary (18 enclosures).
Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]:
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Common chimpanzee: _Pan troglodytes_ (Hominidae) / 0.33 / 0.33 / 100 / 0.33
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: Within the framework of wild diseases surveillance, the Cameroon network of Animal diseases epidemio-surveillance (RESCAM), Ministry of Livestock, Fisheries and Animal industries, was informed about the mortality of a chimpanzee from the Mefou Primate Sanctuary, on 16 Aug [2016]. Following epidemiological investigation and sampling, the Research center for Armies health (CRESAR) performed analyses and confirmed the presence of simian orthopoxvirus, which is the causal agent responsible for a zoonotic disease known as Monkeypox. Poxvirus Congo basin strain was identified. The group of 22 chimpanzees (1 sick plus 1 dead) used to live in a 3-hectares enclosure isolated from the other compartments of the sanctuary (18 enclosures). Clinical signs were: lack of appetite and progressive occurrence of nodules and blisters on the face. The sanctuary is populated with chimpanzees, gorillas and monkeys (300 in total) over about 900 hectares. It is compartmentalized and fenced. Animals were introduced within the sanctuary. Quarantine was applied (sick animals kept inside the enclosure) and biosecurity measures are reinforced for the staff working within the enclosure. Epidemiological investigation is continuing and active surveillance of rodents and the environment is being performed within the sanctuary.

Control measures
Measures applied: disinfection/disinfestations; quarantine; surveillance outside containment and/or protection zone; surveillance within containment and/or protection zone; vaccination prohibited; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Army Health Research Center (CRESAR) (national laboratory) / Common chimpanzee / gene sequencing / - / Pending
Army Health Research Center (CRESAR) (national laboratory) / Common chimpanzee / real-time PCR / 17 Aug 2016 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[Sporadic human cases of monkeypox occur in Cameroon. The monkeypox virus clade in the Congo Basin causes more severe disease in humans, with a case fatality rate of 11-17 percent.

Because human-to-human transmission appears to be limited, most monkeypox cases are closely associated with spillover transmission from animal reservoirs. The main reservoirs of monkeypox are believed to be rope squirrels (_Funisciurus_ spp.; an arboreal rodent), which were implicated in monkeypox outbreaks elsewhere in the DRC in the 1980s, or terrestrial rodents in the genera _Cricetomys_ and _Graphiurus_. - Mod.PMB
