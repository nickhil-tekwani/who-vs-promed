At least 215 people, mostly children, have died in an outbreak of
Japanese encephalitis in an impoverished region of northern Indian
and the death toll is likely to soar, officials said Saturday [28 Aug
2010]. Eastern parts of India's most populous state Uttar Pradesh are
ravaged by encephalitis each year ... but this is one of the worst
outbreaks, officials said.

The deaths of 4 more children on Saturday [28 Aug 2010] pushed the
toll to 215, with hundreds sick in hospitals in Gorakhpur, an ...
area of 14 million people, regional health officer UK Srivastava told
AFP by telephone from Gorakhpur. "A total of 1324 patients had been
admitted in hospitals until Saturday in Gorakhpur," which is the
epicentre of the outbreak, and "more encephalitis patients are coming
into our hospitals," Srivastava said.

The outbreak began in early July [2010]. "We fear the total number of
encephalitis cases will go up to at least 3500 and the death rate
will be at a ratio of around 20 percent," he said.

"We have begun spraying insecticide to wipe out populations of the
_Culex_ mosquitoes which transmits the disease [virus] and we're
handing out chlorine to villagers to disinfect drinking water
supplies," Srivastava said.

KP Kushwaha, chief paediatrician at Gorakhpur's BRD Medical College,
said doctors were overwhelmed ... and "encephalitis usually surfaces
by August but this year [2010] patients began coming in from early
July" and if it continues this is going to be "an impossible task to
handle," he added.

VS Nigam, in charge of Uttar Pradesh's encephalitis prevention
programme, said a mammoth project to contain the disease had ended
with 35 million children vaccinated in the state's 34 districts. But
as soon children are vaccinated against Japanese encephalitis, they
fall sick with acute encephalitis syndrome "because when one virus is
suppressed by vaccines, others become dominant," he said. "It's a
large challenge," he added.

The regional chapter of the Voluntary Health Association, India's
largest non-governmental organisation, which works alongside the UN
Children's Fund (UNICEF), blamed the annual tragedy on the state's
failure to effectively immunise children. "A high alert is sounded
only after an encephalitis epidemic flares," association executive
director JP Sharma said. "Preventive steps should be taken well ahead
of the monsoon as vaccines need an incubation period to make human
beings immune to the virus," Sharma told AFP [immunity is not
immediate following vaccination, there is a time lag during which
time the immune system develops antibodies against the antigen
contained in the vaccine. - Mod.MPP] .

[The encephalitis outbreak continues. The number of reported
fatalities has increased from 189 on 24 Aug 2010 to the 215 in just 4
days, reported today (28 Aug 2010). Vaccination to get ahead of an
ongoing outbreak requires a very aggressive campaign. Once again, the
acute encephalitis syndrome is mentioned as involved in the outbreak,
without indicating which viruses might be involved, nor what
proportion of the cases are due to Japanese encephalitis virus infections.
