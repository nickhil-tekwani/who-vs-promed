A giant billboard on US Highway 59 carries a message that is hard to
miss. [A picture of the billboard can be found at
http://www2.wkrg.com/news/2011/nov/14/syphilis-outbreak-baldwin-county-ar-2704819/.
The billboard refers to cases of syphilis in Baldwin County, Alabama.]
"We had one syphilis case in all of 2010 and so far this year we've
had about 45 cases," according to Victor Creagh with the Alabama
Department of Public Health.

State health department officials have tracked the increase to 2 main
causes. "Escambia County, Florida that's one of the connections that
we've made and there is also pretty good involvement of drug use,
particularly crack cocaine," says Creagh. Escambia County, Florida is
dealing with its own outbreak. The highest number of reported cases in
30 years.

The treatment for syphilis is relatively simple. A shot of penicillin.
Not treating the disease can be deadly. "After many, many years of
having syphilis you can be exposed to neurosyphilis when it goes into
the CSF [cerebrospinal fluid]. Yes, it can be deadly." Dr Yolanda
Jones says syphilis is not necessarily transmitted sexually. "If you
touch someone who has syphilis or an open sore you can be exposed to
syphilis."

The billboard went up earlier this month [November 2011]. The message
is already paying off. "We had an individual to come in as a result of
seeing that billboard because he had the same symptoms in his hands
and feet." Testing and treatment for syphilis can be done for free at
any county health department.

[From Mod.ML's comment in ProMED-mail post Syphilis - USA (NY) 20070814.2650:

"The total number of cases of syphilis (primary, secondary, and
tertiary) reported annually in the United States declined dramatically
in the 1940's to a low in 2000. As the rate of primary and secondary
(infectious) syphilis (a better indicator of disease activity)
decreased among homosexual and bisexual males, largely because of
changes in sexual behavior due to AIDS, a spike occurred in the late
1980s among heterosexual men, women, and neonates (congenital
syphilis) that was attributed to epidemic of crack cocaine use and
exchange of sex for drugs. Cases of syphilis again dropped from 1990
to 2000. In 2000, the rate of primary and secondary syphilis in the
United States was 2.1 cases per 100 000 population, the lowest since
reporting began in 1941. From 2001 to 2004, the primary and secondary
syphilis rate increased nationally to 2.7, primarily as a result of
increases in cases among men who have sex with men
(http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5510a1.htm)."

The CDC reported that Alabama had 417 cases of primary and secondary
syphilis in 2009
(http://www.cdc.gov/std/syphilis2009/Syphilis-2009-All-Profiles.pdf)
and this state ranked 5 among the 50 US states, Washington, DC, and 3
territories with an incidence rate of 8.9 cases per 100 000 population
compared to the US as a whole with a rate of 4.6 cases per 100 000
population. In 2009 the CDC reported that the rate in Alabama among
blacks was 10.5 times that of whites and the rate among Hispanics was
4.2 times that of whites in Alabama; the rate in males in Alabama was
1.6 times the rate in males in the US as a whole and the rate in
females in Alabama was 4.1 time the rate in females in the US as a
whole
(http://www.cdc.gov/std/syphilis2009/Syphilis-2009-All-Profiles.pdf).
With an estimated 2011 population in Baldwin County of 187 173
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baldwin_County,_Alabama), the
incidence rate of what is likely primary and secondary syphilis in
Baldwin County in 2010 is 0.53 per 100 000 and in 2011 so far is 24
per 100 000.

The current outbreak in Baldwin County was attributed in the news
report above to both crack cocaine and an outbreak in the adjacent
Escambia County, Florida, but more detailed epidemiologic data is
required, such as a breakdown of what segments of the population are
involved.

Baldwin County, Alabama is adjacent to Escambia County, Florida, the
westernmost county on the Gulf of Mexico in the US state of Florida.
