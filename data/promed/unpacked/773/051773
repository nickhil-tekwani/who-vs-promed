As of 16 February, 282 cases with 10 deaths (case fatality rate 3.5%) have
been reported, mainly in Moroni (the capital city) and surrounding villages
and Mbni 40 km north of Moroni. _Vibrio cholerae_ O1, El Tor has been
confirmed by the national laboratory in Moroni and Institut Pasteur, Paris.
Testing for antibiotic susceptibility showed the isolates to be sensitive
to doxycycline and tetracycline and resistant to bactrim and
choloramphenicol.
WHO has been involved with the national authorities in controlling the
outbreak since it was notified on 19 January. A national cholera committee
has been established with personnel from the Ministry of Health, other UN
agencies and NGOs meeting daily in the WHO office. Activities are directed
at improving case management in the national hospital, training of health
staff and education of the general public, ensuring safe water, supplies of
oral rehydration salts, chlorine and other material.
Mobile teams have been employed to provide health education, disseminate
information and to disinfect and chlorinate water sources. Teams have
visited affected areas to assess the situation and neighbouring islands to
initiate outbreak preparedness. A plan for preparedness and control for
the coming six months is currently being considered by the national
authorities.
