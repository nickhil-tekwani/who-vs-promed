ANTHRAX, DEER - USA (TEXAS)

Two weeks ago when I was in West Texas interviewing veterinarians and deer
ranchers I was informed by the manager of a large ranch that the recent
deaths on his place had been confirmed as anthrax. Checking with the
laboratory concerned, this information was confirmed. This ranch is in
Edwards County, south of Rock Springs.
This was unfortunately to be expected, as this ranch had had a die-off of
biblical proportions among its white-tail and exotic deer. The recent
deaths had included 2 bucks in late August 2002. The environmental
contamination must be extreme, as the die-off in 2001 was of such
proportions (estimated at >90 percent) that there were eventually far, far
too many carcasses for him to collect, as he had been doing when the ranch
was first afflicted.
The good news is that though sporadic deer deaths have been seen this year
on other ranches, no other anthrax cases have been diagnosed in the region.
It is suspected that the number of feral pigs in that region of Texas is
now much lower, but no hard data is available.
