Milk Substitute Consumed by 3 BSE Cows had Dutch Fat
----------------------------------------------------
TOKYO: A milk substitute consumed by all 3 cows in Japan diagnosed
with mad cow disease contained an animal fat produced in the
Netherlands, where 21 cases of infection have been confirmed since
1997, farm ministry officials said Monday.
Officials of the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries said the
animal fat is believed to have been imported to Japan by a subsidiary
of the National Federation of Agricultural Co-operative Associations
(ZEN-NOH).

Sheep with Scrapie Suspected of Ending up in Cattle Feed
--------------------------------------------------------
SAPPORO: Internal organs of a sheep infected with scrapie may have
been used in Japan to make meat-and-bone meal (MBM), the suspected
source of mad cow disease, local authorities in Hokkaido said Friday.
According to the city government of Kitami in Hokkaido and the
livestock health and hygiene center of the Hokkaido prefectural
government, the sheep was raised at a farm of the National Livestock
Breeding Center of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Ministry in the
town of Otofuke in Hokkaido.
The sheep was given to a farm in Kitami and was shipped to a
meat-processing center in the city on 15 Apr 1991.

Many Cows Ate Fish Meal Mixed with MBM
--------------------------------------
TOKYO: Japanese livestock farmers widely gave to cows a type of
feed made from a mixture of powdered fish meal and meat-and-bone
meal (MBM) until the government prohibited the use of MBM in
September [2001? for its suspected link to mad cow disease, industry
sources said Wednesday.
The mixed feed was originally developed for poultry, but many
farmers fed the feed -- known as "adjusted fish meal" -- to cows, the
sources said.

[The various different hypotheses about the origin of the Japanese BSE
problem, 3 of which are mentioned in the above media postings,
remind one of similar deliberations in European countries that have
discovered their positive BSE status in recent years. Milk replacers in
dairy farms have been mentioned as one of the potential sources of
BSE contamination since the early BSE days in the UK. Recent media
publications in Scandinavia (e.g., Sydsvenska Dagbladet, a Swedish
newspaper) have mentioned German-made milk substitute as a possible
source for the Danish BSE. The Japanese mention a Dutch animal-fat
ingredient in their milk replacers.
The subject needs clarification; ProMED-mail has been trying to verify
these rumors, so far without significant results. - Mod.AS
