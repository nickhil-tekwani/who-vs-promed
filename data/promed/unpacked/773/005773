Dengue Virus Type 3 Isolated in State of Rio
--------------------------------------------
The Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (Fiocruz) has isolated Dengue virus type 3 from
10 cases that occurred in the state of Rio during the first days of the
year 2002. The information is cause for concern because it confirms that
this serotype of Dengue virus is spreading.
The introduction of dengue virus type 3, also present in the State of
Roraima, represents a new threat because it is a form of the virus to which
not all the population is immune and is therefore susceptible. This could
imply an increase in the number of cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever -- the
most severe form of the disease -- which this year has already killed more
than 5 people in the state of Rio. So far, 6676 cases of dengue fever have
been registered, 119 of which correspond to dengue hemorrhagic fever.

Venezuela: Dengue/DHF, Epidemic Activity Update
-----------------------------------------------
According to figures published by the Venezuelan Ministry of Health in its
publication "Alerta", as of Sat 19 Jan 2002, 4733 persons had contracted
dengue fever. Although dengue hemorrhagic fever accounts for 10 percent of
the cases, there have been no fatalities.
The official report confirms that the country continues to face an epidemic
(as it did during most of 2001), and that the number of patients is higher
than expected. The health authorities attribute this increase to factors
such as the rationing of water, according to reports received from the
individual states.
The epidemic is affecting at least 13 states (Bolivar, Cojedes, Guarico,
Lara, Merida, Miranda, Nueva Esparta, Portuguesa, Sucre, Tachira, Trujillo,
Vargas, and Zulia), but it is Zulia that reports the largest number of
cases: 831 in a single week, and 2125 cases during the first 20 days of the
year. The west axis of the country is responsible for 64 percent of the
total number of sick people in the whole country. A state of alarm persists
in the Metropolitan District, as well as in Anzoategui, Aragua, Barinas,
Carabobo, Monagas, and Yaracuy. However, "Alerta" states that the review of
the last 11 epidemiological weeks indicates a general tendency towards a
decrease in the number of cases.
The document from the Ministry also states that the under 15-age group is
the most affected (54 percent).

Regarding the Endemicity of Dengue Fever in Cuba
------------------------------------------------
[Prof. Gustavo Kourí has forwarded this statement in response to the
comment of Dr. Bernhard R. Beck of the Swiss Tropical Institute relating to
the endemicity of dengue fever in Cuba, which was included as Part 3 of the
ProMED-mail post archived as "Dengue/DHF updates (03): 27 Jan 2002
20020127.3415". - Mod.CP
In the second half of last century Cuba suffered a dengue type 1 epidemic:
In 1977 and by serological studies we proved that 44.46 percent of the
population was infected although the number of reported cases was around
500 000.
In 1981 we suffered the biggest epidemic of dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF)
ever reported, up to now, in the Americas and an intensive programme to
eliminate the disease was launched.
Until 1997 we were a dengue-free country with only imported cases reported.
In that year an outbreak occurred in one municipality (Santiago de Cuba)
with 3012 confirmed cases, including 205 cases of DHF/Dengue shock syndrome
and 12 fatalities. These epidemics were reported to PAHO [at the time by
our Ministry of Health, and had been very well studied and documented by
many publications in international journals.
In the year 2001 we reported a small outbreak of dengue in Havana with 138
cases in a health area on the outskirts of the city, which was detected [at
an early stage and controlled rapidly. This was reported to PAHO last
year. Now we are preparing the official report to PAHO, [and a preliminary
report has already been sent. During the year 2001 more than 97 000
MACELISA tests were carried out in our country, and many of them were not
linked to the outbreak, but to surveillance.
I fail to understand why there is so much interest to prove endemicity of
dengue in Cuba. I think people from the medical area should be pleased to
see how a small, poor country can maintain the country without dengue
endemicity, and should urge other countries in the region to do the same
for the health of their people. [At the present time the TDR programme
includes dengue as a priority, and our experts are cooperating with the
organisation [WHO. [In addition our institute is working on the
development of a recombinant dengue vaccine, and we have research programme
grants awarded by TDR, PAHO, the Wellcome Trust, and the INCO programme of
the E.U.
Currently, a real war against dengue and its vector is being waged in Cuba,
and the Cuban authorities including our President are involved in this
struggle with intensive inter-sectorial coordination and community
participation. We are preparing a plan for sustainability because we are
constantly receiving travelers from dengue endemic areas. Yesterday a
National Headquarter for the Control of Dengue at the highest governmental
level was created and 4 scientists from IPK (Instituto de Medicina Tropical
Pedro Kouri) are included in it.
