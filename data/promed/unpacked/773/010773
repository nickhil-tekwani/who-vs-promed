The Ministry of Health has decided to increase action for
surveillance and prevention of chikungunya fever, which before August
[2010] has never been recorded in the country. Since then, 3 cases of
the disease have been confirmed, 2 in Sao Paulo and one in Rio de
Janeiro. The patients contracted the infection in travels outside the
country, and all have recovered well. [The patients are] a man of 41
years from Rio de Janeiro and one of 55 years from Sao Paulo, who
presented with symptoms after a trip to Indonesia, and a 3rd patient,
a woman of 25 years from Sao Paulo who was in India. The woman is the
only one who still has arthralgia and is under medication.

Like dengue [virus], chikungunya fever [virus] is transmitted by
_Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes infected with the virus. There are also
cases of infection caused [transmitted] by the mosquito _Aedes
albopictus_. Circulation of the virus in the Americas has not been
recorded. Even so, the Ministry of Health stressed the importance of
strengthening surveillance, especially given the fact that the
country has a lot of [vector] mosquito breeding sites.

"It would be irresponsible to say that the risk of an outbreak is
zero, but there is no need for alarm or worry. We had 3 imported
cases; the patients progressed well, and the prevention and control
measures were applied in a timely way," stated the Coordinator of the
National Program for Dengue Control of the Ministry of Health,
Giovanini Coelho. "Our efforts will be to not let the disease spread.
[We will] identify imported cases as soon as possible, isolate them
and take preventive measures," [said Coelho]. To accomplish this, the
Ministry will use the existing dengue [control] structure.

The WHO has now been notified of the confirmed cases in Brazil.

[The stage is set for the introduction of chikungunya [virus]: _Aedes
aegypti_ and _Ae. albopictus_ and people traveling. What protects us,
somewhat, is a relatively short viremia and the relatively small
number of people traveling to endemic regions, but this protection is
far from being absolute. - Mod.LJS]

[ProMED does not usually report imported chikungunya virus infections
where there has been no ongoing local transmission. As Mod.LJS
pointed out, the conditions for ongoing transmission in Brazil are
all in place, and the risk of initiating an outbreak in the densely
populated Brazilian cities where dengue is actively circulating is
serious. The Ministry of Health is wise to take preventive measures
before an outbreak strikes. Once an outbreak in the tropical Americas
begins, there are no barriers to stop it, and it is likely to achieve
the same geographical distribution as dengue viruses. There is no
commercially available vaccine to prevent it.
