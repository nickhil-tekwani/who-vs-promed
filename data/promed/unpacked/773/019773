A routine test of air quality near Busch Stadium on Mon, 16 Oct 2006,
turned up traces of a rare and potentially fatal bacterium that federal
officials have warned could be used by terrorists as a biological weapon.
However, follow-up tests on Tue, 17 Oct 2006, found no evidence of the
bacterium [_Francisella tularensis_, which causes a disease called
tularemia or rabbit fever].
The bacteria are found naturally in Missouri, and 27 people are believed to
have contracted it in the state in 2005, said Dr. William Kincaid, the St.
Louis health director, in a prepared statement. He said the city's sensor
had picked up naturally occurring tularemia. The bacteria can cause lethal
pneumonia or meningitis.

[This "blip"(?) from (presumably) a BioWatch air sensor in Saint Louis
parallels similar past events in Washington DC, Houston TX and Salt Lake
City UT. Of note, several days of positive readings were detected in DC in
2005. The tularemia bacillus, a bioterrorism Category A agent endemic in
Missouri, is present in the environment, through carcasses decaying in the
soil, airborne dissemination of contaminated dust/dirt, and possible
short-term presence in local water pools; one of these environmental
sources may have served as the origin of the blip. No cases of human
disease have been reported with any of the past episodes. - Mod.LL]
