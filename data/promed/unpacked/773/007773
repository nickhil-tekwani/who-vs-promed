[1] Mali: new cases

Investigators have identified 5 people infected by Ebola in Mali and have a 6th suspected case as the nation races to contain the virus that has ravaged 3 of its West African neighbors. More than 200 people who had contacts with those individuals have been identified, and new cases will probably be confirmed in the coming days, Hubert Balique, a French public-health expert consulting with the French embassy in Mali, told reporters yesterday [13 Nov 2014] in the capital city, Bamako.

A 25 year old nurse died from Ebola on 11 Nov 2014 at a clinic in Mali, the World Health Organization and Mali health authorities said on 12 Nov 2014. He had treated a 70 year old grand imam from Guinea, who was hospitalized for kidney failure and wasn't tested for Ebola. A worker at the same clinic is in isolation as officials race to prevent the virus from spreading further in a 4th West African nation. Ebola has killed more than 5000 people in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone since December [2013], making it the worst outbreak since the disease was identified in 1976 in what is now the Democratic Republic of Congo. The Pasteur Clinic in Bamako, where the clinic staff member and the nurse worked, has been quarantined, France's embassy said in a text message to its registered nationals in the country yesterday [13 Nov 2014]. The message asked anyone who had treatment at the clinic or knows someone who did to call a phone line.

Mali is getting help from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to trace people who have had contact with Ebola-infected individuals, Balique said. Senegal and Nigeria have been declared free of the disease. Mali last month [October 2014] became the 6th country in West Africa to confirm a case of Ebola, when a woman brought her infected 2 year old granddaughter from Guinea. The girl died on 24 Oct 2014. WHO now lists 4 deaths in Mali, including the original case, which is unrelated to the current outbreak. Mali's president Ibrahim Boubacar Keita asked prime minister Moussa Mara to take steps to prevent the further spread of the virus, the nation's council of ministers said in an emailed statement.

[2] Mali: border checks

Mali announced tougher health checks at border crossings after registering its 2nd Ebola outbreak...

In Mali, which shares an 800 km (500 mi) border with Guinea, a nurse died of Ebola on [Tue 11 Nov 2014], and on [Thu 13 Nov 2014] a doctor at the same clinic was also revealed to be infected. More than 90 people had already been quarantined in the capital Bamako after the nurse's death, just as a group exposed to Mali's 1st case completed their required 21 days of isolation. "The president of the republic has asked the prime minister to look urgently at the entire system put in place to fight Ebola and to strengthen health controls at the different frontier posts," a government statement said. But officials said there were no plans to close the border, even though the nurse had been infected by a man who arrived from Guinea.

President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita urged WHO and health services in Mali and neighboring states to set up a permanent information exchange to improve awareness about public health and hygiene.

[It is somewhat surprising to me that after months of media coverage about the Ebola epidemic in West Africa, countries in that region are still asking for information exchange to improve awareness. Africa has ECOWAS (the Economic Community of West African States), a WHO Regional Office with Country Representatives in nearly all West African countries and national focal points for the IHR (WHO International Health Regulations), the African Union, and numerous other African organizations through which to exchange information. And they could always subscribe to ProMED!

One would have thought that at least in capital cities the authorities would be aware of health events in neighboring states and be on the lookout for imported cases. Mali also has a border with Senegal, which is now once again at risk of infection.
