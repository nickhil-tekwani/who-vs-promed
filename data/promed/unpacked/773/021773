[This is a formal confirmation of the news report but with no further information.

Late October is not within the usual "summer" anthrax season, especially in the northern latitudes. Out-of-season livestock outbreaks are usually, though not always, due to feeding contaminated feed of some sort. With cattle it is usually from contaminated hay. This is hard to confirm as it involves contaminated soil being caught up in the hay as mud when it is being worked and baled, and the amount of soil involved can be small and harder to find than a needle. The give away can be that outbreaks (note plural) occur on farms that purchased the hay from a common source, and sometimes at a distance from the hay source; the source in this type of case usually has a history of past outbreaks. And if one cow goes down, another might, thus the wisdom in vaccinating this herd. And with purchased hay sources, the isolate's genotype may be atypical for the area where the outbreak occurred. - Mod.MHJ
