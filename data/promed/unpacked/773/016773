Western Australia has placed restrictions on the importation of poultry and
eggs from NSW following the detection of Newcastle disease at two Sydney
chicken farms. The move came amid fears the disease could spread to other
States.
WA's Primary Industry Minister Monty House said yesterday the restrictions
applied only to the properties quarantined in Blacktown and Glenorie in
Sydney's west. "A total ban on imports from NSW would unnecessarily disrupt
the West Australian broiler industry," he said. "Eggs which have (now) been
moved into the State either originate from outside the controlled areas or
have been treated and are considered safe."
Veterinary authorities were overseeing the slaughter of 2500 chickens on
another NSW poultry farm yesterday after investigations revealed the disease
might have spread.
NSW Agriculture spokesman Col Begg said the farm at Rylstone, 160km
north-west of Sydney, was classified a "dangerous contact property" because
some of the birds there had been traced to the infected Blacktown farm. NSW
chief veterinary officer Dick Jane said preliminary testing had not
identified the disease on the Rylstone property but the birds were being
slaughtered as a precaution. Specific laboratory results from the Australian
Animal Health Laboratory in Geelong are awaited. The Consultative Committee
on Emergency Animal Diseases has recommended slaughter and disposal of all
the birds on the isolated Rylstone farm as a precautionary measure.

Authorities have banned bird competitions, race meetings, shows and
gatherings of birds in most of the Sydney metropolitan area.
Mr Begg said 10 000 pullets from the two [confirmed farms had been
destroyed. "As of yesterday we had 82 000 chickens to go. They will be
starting on that today," he said. And he said the ban could be in place for
months. "If we get any more dangerous contact properties, it might lengthen
the entire process," he said.
He said blood tests were continuing in the Sydney metropolitan area,
beginning in the areas surrounding the infected properties and working out
to lower risk areas.
