More Upper Hunter properties have been quarantined, more cattle have
died and extra vaccine sent to the area as the anthrax outbreak
continues to spread. A total of 9 Upper Hunter properties are now
under quarantine after more cattle tested positive, despite the
repeated assurances from the Department of Primary Industries (DPI)
that the disease had been contained. A department spokesman said
yesterday [2 Jan 2008] that there had been 36 confirmed deaths from
the disease, including 3 earlier this week at the Miles family's
Bingeberry Hereford Stud at Rouchel.
He said tests this week also revealed that a horse, which died
suddenly in the Rouchel area, did not die from anthrax. Last Friday
[28 Dec 2007], only 12 deaths were confirmed and 5 properties
quarantined.
"We were getting reports of several cattle deaths a day," the
spokesman said. "We are not expecting the disease to stop
immediately. Usually diseases like this trickle off or plateau out."
The DPI will continue to monitor the situation and has sent more
vaccines to Rouchel this week.
The disease is costing graziers thousands of dollars in cattle losses
and has stopped stock moving to cattle sales.
Anthrax is caused by the bacterium _Bacillus anthracis_, which lives
in certain types of soil. Humans can be contaminated by contact with
infected animals or animal products. Most cases of anthrax are seen
in cattle and sheep. A knackery [renderer] worker in northern
Victoria contracted the disease from an infected cow in an anthrax
outbreak in the Stanhope area this year. [Presumably she meant in
2007. - Mod.MHJ] The man recovered in hospital. Vaccinations are
common for livestock workers [?] and anthrax can be fatal for humans
without early detection and the swift application of antibiotics.

[This appears to be more authoritative than yesterday's '31 Dec 2007'
account as the local diagnostic laboratory has got caught up on their
backlog of tests. This is in no way critical of their work. When I
was at Weybridge the head of the Bacteriology Department would
regularly complain to me that I could collect more field samples in
30 minutes than they could process in a month. Secondly, field
samples for anthrax diagnosis present more problems than we had
realised as the longer dead the animal sampled the more likely it is
that the laboratory will come up with a false negative. We recently
completed a multisite comparison of diagnostic test kits and one
finding was that the classical culture isolation methods have
problems. PCR (polymerase chain reaction) may well be a better route
to go from the start and not use it for just confirmation. So for the
moment there are 9 affected premises with 36 confirmed anthrax
deaths, with more expected.
The details on the Victoria 2007 outbreaks can be accessed from the
reports listed below. Human vaccinations for anthrax are not common
in my experience except for laboratory workers and for some 1st
responder units. If it is routinely done in Victoria, it would
reflect a higher frequency of exposure of knackers than the rest of
us normally see. They have had significant outbreaks in 1997, 2002,
2004, and 2007. - Mod.MHJ]
