----------------------------------------------------------------------
Despite a high incidence of _Citrus tristeza virus_ (CTV) in citrus
in New Zealand, viral diseases have had only a minor impact on the
New Zealand citrus industry, largely because of the use of _Poncirus
trifoliata_ and hybrid rootstocks derived from this species.

In August 2007, a survey for 7 citrus viruses was conducted on 104
commercial orchard trees that represented a range of _Citrus_ scion
species, as well as _P. trifoliata_ and _P. trifoliata_ x _Citrus
sinensis_ rootstock, grown from imported and local budwood or from
seed in the case of rootstocks, from the citrus-growing regions of
Kerikeri, Tauranga, and Gisborne.

In PCR [polymerase chain reaction] assays for a 425 bp [base pair]
region of the _Citrus leaf blotch virus_ (CLBV) coat protein gene, 26
(25 percent) of samples yielded a DNA fragment of the size expected
for CLBV, including 6 of 21 _C. sinensis_, 1 of 2 _C. limon_, 3 of 10
_C. unshiu_, and 5 of 7 _C. paradisi_ scion samples, and 5 of 9 _P.
trifoliata_ and 6 of 9 _P. trifoliata_ x _C. sinensis_ rootstock
samples. Identification of CLBV (an unclassified member of the family
_Flexiviridae_) was confirmed by amplification of a 2nd region of the
genome of 1045 bp (from ORF2/ORF3).

A subset of the PCR products for both fragments was sequenced.
Sequences from all CLBV isolates showed 97 to 99 percent nucleotide
identity with the CLBV reference isolate SRA-153 (GenBank database)
in the coat protein fragment and 98 to 99 percent nucleotide identity
for the partial ORF2/ORF3 fragment.

The bud-union crease symptom reported to be caused by CLBV was
observed only on one _C. paradisi_ scion on _P. trifoliata_
rootstock, while the remaining samples were either asymptomatic or
symptoms were attributed to co-infection with CTV. Since
CLBV-infected plants were found from all major growing regions, it is
apparent that CLBV is widespread in New Zealand, although it is not
known where in this country it may have originated.

[2] _Strawberry mottle virus_
Date: July 2008

[Ref: LI Ward et al: _Strawberry mottle virus_ detected on strawberry
in New Zealand. BSPP New Disease Reports, vol. 17]
--------------------------------------------------
_Strawberry mottle virus_ (SMoV) is a serious pathogen of
strawberries (_Fragaria x ananassa_) and is transmitted by aphids in
a semi-persistent manner. Severe strains of SMoV may reduce yield by
up to 30 percent and losses can be up to 80 percent in mixed
infections with other viruses.

In May 2007, leaf mottling was observed on indicator plants of
_Fragaria vesca_ 'EMK' (Fig. 1) and 'UC4', and _F. virginiana_ 'UC12'
held in an open-shade house near Christchurch, New Zealand. No virus
particles were seen using electron microscopy on crude sap
preparations from symptomatic leaves, nor were symptoms observed when
healthy plants of _Chenopodium amaranticolor_, _C. quinoa_, _Cucumis
sativus_, _Gomphrena globosa_, _Nicotiana benthamiana_, _N.
clevelandii_, _N. occidentalis_, and _N. sylvestris_ [species used as
bioindicators in plant virus diagnostics - Mod.DHA] were mechanically
inoculated with plant sap.

RNA was extracted from symptomatic strawberry plants and tested by
SMoV- specific RT-PCR [reverse transcription PCR]. Fragments of the
expected size (219 bp) were obtained and an amplicon from _F. vesca_
was sequenced. A search in GenBank confirmed SMoV (98 percent
identity). The plants also tested positive for SMoV using real-time
RT-PCR.

In July 2007, 35 plants of commercial cultivars of _F. ananassa_ were
collected at random from 10 locations throughout New Zealand and the
crowns and leaves were tested for SMoV using conventional and
real-time RT-PCR. Indicator plants of _F. virginiana_ 'UC11' and
'UC12' held in a glasshouse in Auckland were also tested. All
commercial cultivars were uninfected but the indicator plants from
Auckland tested positive for SMoV with both PCR methods. All plants
were also tested by RT-PCR for _Raspberry ringspot virus_,
_Strawberry latent ringspot virus_, _Strawberry vein banding virus_,
_Tomato ringspot virus_, and _Tomato black ring virus_ and were found
to be uninfected.

SMoV occurs in many areas where strawberries are grown; this is the
1st report of the virus in New Zealand. The SMoV-infected indicator
plants have been grown in New Zealand for at least 10 years. Despite
the indicators in Christchurch being held in an open-shade house, and
the presence of at least 2 aphid species that can vector the virus in
New Zealand (_Aphis gossypii_ and _Chaetosiphon fragaefolii_), the
virus does not appear to have become widely distributed within
commercial strawberry cultivars. However, it has been decided not to
impose regulatory controls to eradicate or manage the disease and
therefore the disease is likely to spread in the future.

[_Citrus leaf blotch virus_ (CLBV; family of _Flexiviridae_, not yet
assigned to a genus) has been recently characterised from leaves of
Nagami kumquat that showed bud union crease when propagated on Troyer
citrange [a citrus variety]. However, no virus could be detected in
other citrus trees with similar symptoms and the involvement of CLBV
in causing the bud union disorder remains unclear. The known host
range of CLBV is
presently restricted to citrus, and vector transmission has not been
demonstrated. Comparison of isolates from Spain, Japan, USA, France,
and Australia show low genetic diversity indicating a strong negative
selection pressure on this pathogen.

_P. trifoliata_ (trifoliate orange) is graft-compatible with _Citrus_
and is widely used as rootstock for commercial citrus varieties
because it confers resistance to some diseases and may also improve
general performance. _Citrus tristeza virus_ (CTV) is considered one
of the most destructive of the ca. 30 known citrus viruses. More
information on CTV can be found via ProMED-mail post no.
20080404.1237 (see below).

_Strawberry mottle virus_ (SMoV; genus _Sadwavirus_, not yet assigned
to a family) is the most widespread virus affecting strawberry plants
worldwide. Symptoms may include vein clearing, leaf mottle, reduced
plant vigour, and reduced fruit production. Symptoms vary seasonally,
and some _Fragaria_ species do not show the typical mottling at all.
The virus is spread by aphids including several _Chaetosiphon_
species and _Aphis gossypii_, and can also be transmitted by
mechanical means and grafting, but is not seed transmitted. There are
many strains of SMoV with varying severity. Disease management
includes use of certified clean planting material and vector control.
SMoV may also be found in a virus complex together with several other
species, which can severely reduce yield.
