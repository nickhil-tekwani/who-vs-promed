-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The investigators of the August 2014 Jungle Warfare Training Center (JWTC) disease outbreak would like to thank Dr. Clement for his thoughtful inputs. At this time, we are actively collating data for publication on this disease outbreak.

For clarification purposes, leptospirosis is endemic to Okinawa. In the community there were 26 cases reported this year [2014], which is on par with high years and far above the average for low years in examining the community data. Leptospirosis in Okinawa is connected to rainfall and climatic data. Camp Fuji is an additional USMC training complex located on mainland Japan. Because of its location, citing previous outbreaks of scrub typhus in this area is not comparable, since Camp Fuji has a vastly different climate and conducts different training.

While we do have scrub typhus throughout the Pacific [region], there has only been a single case reported in Okinawa this year while there have been 148 cases throughout Japan.

The exposure that Marines undergo is unlike anything civilians might be exposed to in the local area. I would urge those interested in this exposure to view the open source video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbW-XzNDPNE).

The cases that occurred among the Marines were mainly from 2 units that were affected 2 weeks apart. All case exposures occurred during the month of August, however the "outbreak" continued into September, as that is when Marines presented for treatment. The outbreak in each unit appeared to be from a point source based on the epicurves. Unit 1 completed the course 2 weeks prior to unit 2, had a 22 percent attack rate, and one hospitalization. Unit 2 completed the course with a 42 percent attack rate, and 44 personnel hospitalized. The 40 percent attack rate is not unusual for personnel not using doxycycline prophylaxis for leptospirosis and was also seen in a 1987 outbreak in the same general area that prompted the institution of doxycycline prophylaxis at the JWTC (1). Typical doxycycline prophylaxis at JWTC is one 200 mg dose of doxycycline 1 week prior to completion of the Endurance Course, one 200 mg dose the day of or day before completion of the Endurance Course, and 200 mg dose the following week. This dosing regimen is based on the placebo-controlled trial conducted in Panama in the early 80s (2). For unknown reasons, unit 2 was not instructed to take a post-exposure dose of doxycycline.

The cases from unit 1 were discovered retrospectively after unit 2 began to see significant numbers of ill personnel with a presumptive diagnosis of leptospirosis. Personnel from unit 1 were largely diagnosed with viral gastroenteritis initially with a few suspicious for leptospirosis. Once titers (indirect hemagglutination from Mayo Clinic) started returning positive and increasing with subsequent draws, it became clear that the majority of the diagnoses in unit 1 were also leptospirosis.

All 239 personnel (cases and non-cases) from the 2 units were interviewed by questionnaire. The most common symptoms were: fever, headache, nausea/vomiting, chills, sweating, myalgias, abdominal pain, and dark urine. The most common laboratory findings (aside from the previously mentioned positive indirect hemagglutination tests) were: transient proteinuria, mild thrombocytopenia, elevated AST or ALT. Very few patients had elevated BUN or creatinine. Incubation [period] of the disease was on average 9.6 days from exposure to the watercourse. Average length of illness was 8 days total. Average number of days hospitalized was 3 days and ranged from 1 to 7. No skin ulcers were described in either the medical record or by patients on questioning. A few patients noted an antecedent rash a few days before onset of fever.

On preliminary analysis, risk factors for becoming ill were fully submerging in the pit and pond (a man-made water course with no natural water feed) and swallowing water in the pit and pond. A handful of personnel described completing the course, but not going in the water. These personnel did not get ill. All personnel were wearing uniforms pre-treated with permethrin and wearing DEET on exposed skin. All personnel have returned to full duty at this time.

We have a few theories on the reasons for illness in this group. Unit 1 would have never been found without unit 2 having 31 cases present in a single day. It is possible that we have had more cases of undetected leptospirosis in our Marines due to the prophylaxis regimen keeping most ill personnel either out of medical view or presenting with such minor disease that the complaints were felt to constitute a less serious and self-limiting condition such as gastroenteritis.

Group 2 essentially conducted an experiment on themselves without knowing it. It is unclear why they did not take the regimen with a post-exposure dose of doxycycline as prescribed by JWTC medical, but their change in procedures may serve as an indication that a post exposure dose is mandatory for leptospirosis prophylaxis.

Additionally, this has been a particularly wet year on the island of Okinawa. Past leptospirosis outbreaks recorded on Okinawa have also occurred in August or September and following significant rains. We are hoping to analyze long-term climatic data and match it to other leptospirosis outbreaks in the region.

We are also very concerned about the "why now?" piece of this puzzle. However, it is not unheard of in the region, happens periodically, and has had similar attack rates to what we saw with this outbreak. The publication of these results has been slow, partially owing to the long lag time from both the conversion on leptospirosis titers as well as the length of time it takes to get results back. We have many lessons learned that are already being implemented due to this outbreak and welcome other comments or suggestions. Please feel free to contact either of us directly. Concerns about the surgical procedures have been noted and will be shared with our surgical colleagues.

[ProMED-mail thanks Drs Servies and Dierks for a more detailed description of the leptospirosis outbreak that occurred among US Marines at the Jungle Warfare Training Center in Okinawa, Japan.

The Jungle Warfare Training Center provides expert instruction to prepare Marine and Joint Forces for the rigors of combat in a dense jungle environment. It is located in Camp Gonsalves, in Northern Okinawa, Japan (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camp_Gonsalves). Camp Fuji is another installation of the United States Marine Corps adjacent to the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force Camp Takigahara, located in the Shizuoka Prefecture of Japan, at the base of Mount Fuji, on Honshu, the largest and most populous island of Japan (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camp_Fuji).
