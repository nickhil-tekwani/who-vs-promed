Yesterday afternoon [3 May 2022] it was confirmed that the bird flu virus that has been causing all kinds of bird species both wild and domestic to succumb to the disease, is the same one that has been circulating in Europe.

Brigitte Brugge, a specialist for poultry diseases, concluded the diagnosis. "What we have seen now with research over the last 2 weeks is that these bird flu viruses are widespread in wild birds in Iceland. We have now found these viruses in different bird species," she says.

Brigitte says it is quite clear that bird flu viruses have entered the country with migratory birds this spring [2022].

A total of 18 positive samples from dead birds have been found in 16 places all over Iceland. 7 wild bird species have been affected by the virus: barnacle goose, sea eagle, raven, greylag goose, white-fronted goose, black-backed gull, and the northern gannet. In our previous article on the bird flu, you can find more information on the gannets and a link to the live webcam[https://grapevine.is/news/2022/04/19/bird-flu-confirmed-in-iceland-what-you-should-know-your-cat-is-safe/].

The focus is now on infection control in poultry farms, but also on those who have some chickens and even the Reykjav√≠k Park and Zoo. Measures must be taken to prevent the spread of infection in chickens and other poultry.

[Since October 2020, Europe has experienced the most severe avian influenza epidemic to date. Wild birds appear to be playing an important role in its spread and maintenance. Most wild birds reported infected have been Anseriformes (swan, ducks, geese), followed by birds of prey.

Some wild migratory waterbirds contribute to the propagation of HPAI viruses.

Some geese and waders winter in the warmer regions of Europe or Africa but breed in Greenland, North-Western Canada, or the high arctic isles of the Atlantic. They use Iceland as an in-between station where they can feed in order to strengthen themselves for the next leg. 2 important migratory passing geese species are the barnacle goose (_Branta leucopsis_) and the brent goose (_Branta bernicla_). Another goose species using Iceland to stopover on their way from the British Isles to Greenland/Canada is the white-fronted goose (_Anser albifrons_). - Mod.PMB
