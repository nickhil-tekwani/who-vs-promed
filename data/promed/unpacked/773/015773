A total of 2 inmates of the New Bilibid Prison (NBP) died after they were hit with diarrhea due to suspected food poisoning over the weekend [27/28 May 2017]. As of [Thu 1 Jun 2017], there are 1212 diarrhea cases in Bilibid, according to an update by the Bureau of Corrections (BuCor). The 2 casualties are a 62 year old inmate who died of hypovolemic shock due to infectious diarrhea in the evening of [Tue 30 May 2017] and a 67 year old who died of diabetic coma early morning of [Wed 31 May 2017]. The Department of Health (DOH) has so far provided 1009 IV fluids and 50 000 aquatabs to the prison cells.

BuCor director general B C de los Santos said they have provided financial assistance to the families of the inmates who passed. "We assure the public that the outbreak is under control and well attended at the NBP hospital," De los Santos said.

In an earlier interview, health secretary Paulyn Ubial said samples of the food the inmates ate over the weekend have been sent to the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) for examination. "We are looking if it's inherently the food or if it was because of the handling. We're also looking at the preparation area in Bilibid, there are some measures we can implement to mitigate or stop this from happening in the future," Ubial said on [Tue 30 May 2017].

Justice secretary Vitaliano Aguirre II personally inspected the inmates on [Mon 29 May 2017] and brought with him bananas and rehydration drinks "to alleviate the conditions of the stricken inmates." Aguirre refused to speculate whether the food poisoning was deliberate. "If there are persons or parties responsible for this then they should be held accountable," Aguirre said.
