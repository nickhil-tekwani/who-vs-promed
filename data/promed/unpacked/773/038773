The number of confirmed cases of bird flu in Slovakia keeps increasing. Since late December [2016] the State Veterinary and Food Administration (SVPS) has registered 7 outbreaks of avian flu at local poultry farms and the number of outbreaks of the disease in wild birds has increased to 35. Almost half of the latter have been water fowl wild birds that have died repeatedly in the same places, especially in the area of Žitný Ostrov and its vicinity in southern Slovakia, the SITA newswire reported.

The region most hit by the avian flu is southern Slovakia where a part of the Komárno district has been declared a monitored area. This is because swans winter here - in the western part of the Váh River and as a result the disease keeps spreading among them.

The occurrence of bird flu has been confirmed in almost all EU member countries except the Baltic countries and Portugal. One of the hardest hit countries is Slovakia's neighbor - Hungary. Here farmers had to destroy almost 3.5 million pieces of poultry.

The 1st case of the avian flu in Slovakia occurred in Bratislava's borough of Dúbravka when an elderly couple reported on [Fri 27 Dec 2016] the death of their complete flock of hens - 65 birds. They were breeding them for meat and eggs for their own consumption.

[HPAI H5 (where neuraminidase typing was available it turned out to be H5N8), continues to occur throughout Europe. This virus has infected poultry, wild and captive birds in several countries, causing immense losses to the poultry industry.
Some recent studies suggest that wild waterfowl and domestic ducks are important in the emergence and maintenance of HPAI H5N8. - Mod.PMB
