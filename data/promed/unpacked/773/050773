The Kenya Fisheries department and provincial authorities in Nyanza are
calling for stiffer penalties for people caught using chemicals to harvest
fish in Lake Victoria. The penalty for poisoning fish in Kenya ranges from
three to six months or a fine not exceeding Ksh3,000 ($50). In Uganda,
where chemical fishing was first reported before it spread to Kenya and
Tanzania, government has put in place measures aimed at eradicating the
practice including penalties of up to seven years in jail and fines of Ush5
million upwards.
Fish poisoning was reported in Kenya in April this year when some fishermen
landed a large catch of fish which was found to be contaminated when tested
by the government chemist in Nairobi. The poisoning affects mainly tilapia
as other species are said to hibernate in deep waters while tilapia breed
and live at the shores of the lake.
Nyanza Provincial Commissioner, Mr Peter Raburu, claimed some fisheries
officials were condoning the poisoning of fish despite efforts to stop the
practice, which is responsible for the depletion of fish stocks in the
lake. The PC said he had personally arrested some fishermen he found using
chemicals to catch fish, only to see them getting away with light
sentences. "When the suspects were taken to court, they were given light
sentences after which they were taken back to the lake beaches in a
fisheries officer's landrover," he said. He said some cases have dragged in
law courts giving the suspects time to go back and continue with the
practice. The practice has also been reported in the districts of Migori,
Kisumu, Siaya and Suba, where the outgoing District Commissioner, Mr Obondo
Kajumbi, has repeatedly warned fishermen against poisoning fish.
The Kisumu District Commissioner, Mr Ali Korane, told The EastAfrican that
the fight to stamp out chemical fishing was is in full force but that their
powers ended after arresting the suspects and taking them to court. Said Mr
Korane: "Unlike other districts, in Kisumu the practice is going down.
However, the punishment meted out by the law courts is beyond our
jurisdiction."
The Assistant Director of Fisheries for Western Kenya province, Mr Mathias
Wafula admits that the use of chemicals is still widespread because the
fishermen involved in the practice play games of "hide and seek" with the
fisheries scouts. "Our efforts are hampered by lack of transport and other
facilities to monitor and patrol the beaches day and night." He said the
Kenyan portion of the lake sector is vast, from Sio Port in Busia District
to Muhuru Bay, and concerted efforts by both the police and the provincial
administration would be needed to eradicate the poisoning of fish. Mr
Wafula said the duty of the fisheries department was to patrol the beaches
and arrest suspects and take them to court. He said law courts should mete
out tougher penalties to discourage the poisoning of fish. He said that the
department wanted patrol boats to operate in the lake throughout night and
day to ensure that every beach was under surveillance.
