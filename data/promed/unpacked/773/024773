As a result of poor hygiene standards and the lack of awareness
campaigns, hepatitis A is fast spreading in Azad Jammu and Kashmir
(AJK), doctors of the area have said. Hepatitis A is an acute illness
associated with fever, malaise, jaundice, anorexia and nausea. The
disease is spreading at an alarming rate, especially in the
earthquake affected areas of the region, where hygiene conditions
have still not improved despite all the money that was spent on these
areas to rehabilitate the health structure.

The Health Department has still not launched any awareness campaigns
to educate the masses about this fast spreading disease. The Khalifa
Sheikh Zaid Al-Nayan hospital in Muzaffarabad has been receiving
patients from the earthquake affected areas of the Neelum and Jhelum
valley, Bagh and Rawalakot districts infected with hepatitis A.

A recent survey conducted by Dr Tahir Raheem Mughal, a general
practitioner (GP) at the hospital in Muzaffarabad, observed that at
least 150 patients were diagnosed with hepatitis A in last 2 months.
"Acute viral hepatitis (AVH) is one of the most common diseases in
the patients who visited hospital," Mughal said. Doctors have
observed that the reason for the spread of AVH in AJK is through the
fecal-oral route, which means that the infection travels from one
person to another when a person comes into contact with something
that is directly or indirectly contaminated by feces of another
infected person.

"Though the hygiene conditions in the region have improved, the lack
of proper sewerage lines adds to the increasing number of AVH
patients," Mughalsaid. The sewerage system in AJK was functional, but
after the October 2005 earthquake, it was destroyed and has still not
been repaired 5 years on. Another big reason for the spread of this
disease is the consumption of contaminated water.

Health experts say that increasing the awareness amongst the general
population regarding preventive measures and improving hygienic
conditions are essential. Hepatitis A vaccine can prevent the spread
of the infection, but patients predominately come to the hospital
late. Two doses are needed 6-18 months apart to ensure long-term protection.

[Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) [current ISO nomenclature: Azad Kashmir
(JK) - CopyEd.MSP], is the southernmost political entity within the
Pakistani-administered part of the former princely state of Jammu and
Kashmir. It borders the present-day Indian-controlled state of Jammu
and Kashmir to the east (separated from it by the Line of Control),
Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa to the west, Gilgit-Baltistan to the north, and
the Punjab Province of Pakistan to the south. With its capital at
Muzaffarabad, Azad Kashmir covers an area of 13 297 square km (5134
sq mi) and has an estimated population of about 4 million.

Hepatitis A is a viral liver disease that can cause mild to severe
illness. It is spread by faecal-oral transmission when a person
ingests food or drink contaminated by an infected person's stool. The
disease is closely associated with poor sanitation and a lack of
personal hygiene habits, such as hand-washing. Epidemics can be
explosive in growth, and improved sanitation and hepatitis A vaccine
are the most effective ways to combat the disease.

The symptoms of hepatitis A range from mild to severe, and can
include fever, malaise, loss of appetite, diarrhoea, nausea,
abdominal discomfort, dark-colored urine and jaundice (a yellowing of
the skin and whites of the eyes). Not everyone who is infected will
have all of the symptoms. Adults have signs and symptoms of illness
more often than children, and the severity of disease and mortality
increases in older age groups. Infected children under 6 years of age
do not usually experience noticeable symptoms, and only 10 percent
develop jaundice. Among older children and adults, infection usually
causes more severe symptoms, with jaundice occurring in more than 70
percent of cases. Most people recover in several weeks -- or
sometimes months -- without complications. (More detailed information
