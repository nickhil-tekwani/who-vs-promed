The blood sample of a man who died of high fever on [20 Oct 2015] at the Jamnagar Civil Hospital, was found positive for the Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) virus, commonly known as Congo fever.

The deceased man (22 years of age), a resident of Rajgor Street in Jamnagar, was admitted to the civil hospital with high fever on [20 Oct 2015] morning. He had been complaining of severe headache for 2 days. The man was studying computer engineering in Jamnagar.

Suspecting symptoms similar to the Congo fever, doctors sent the patient's blood sample for testing. "However, the patient died on [20 Oct 2015], the same day he was admitted. The test report that came on Tuesday evening [17 Oct 2015] confirmed he was suffering from Congo fever," said an official from the Jamnagar Civil Hospital.

[In Gujarat state, this is the 1st report of CCHF from Jamnagar and there are previous reports of cases from the Kutch district in 2015. There was one previous suspected case and 2 confirmed cases, also from the Kutch district of Gujarat state reported on 18 Feb 2015, 29 Mar 2015, and 16 Jul 2015. It is clear that CCHF virus is fairly widespread in India. Not only does transmission occur from contact with blood and tissues of CCHF virus-infected animals and ticks, but with blood and secretions of infected individual people as well, usually in a hospital setting.

The virus can cause severe viral hemorrhagic fever outbreaks, with a case fatality rate of 10-40 per cent. The virus is transmitted by _Hyalomma_ spp ticks or through contact with infected human blood or animal blood and tissues during and immediately after slaughter. The majority of cases have occurred in people involved in the livestock industry, such as agricultural workers, slaughterhouse workers, and veterinarians. Exposure in health care facilities can also occur.

The length of the incubation period depends on the mode of acquisition of the virus. Following infection by a tick bite, the incubation period is usually 1-3 days, with a maximum of 9 days.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention state, "Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is caused by infection with a tickborne virus (_Nairovirus_) in the family _Bunyaviridae_. The disease was initially characterized in the Crimea in 1944 and given the name Crimean hemorrhagic fever. It was then later recognized in 1969 as the cause of illness in the Congo, thus resulting in the current name of the disease.

The virus is sensitive in vitro to the antiviral drug ribavirin, and it has been used in the treatment of CCHF patients, reportedly with some benefit (http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/crimean-congo/). However, since the patient died so soon after admission, effective use of the drug in the treatment of the case above would not have been possible.
