The world's largest agency dealing with global migration is reporting cholera is again on the rise in Haiti. The International Organization for Migration (IOM) says Haitian officials have confirmed 3593 cholera cases and another 837 suspected cases since Hurricane Sandy's [24 Oct 2012] passage.

"The IOM health team continues the surveillance, monitoring, and case management of suspected cholera cases, as well as awareness sessions twice a week in camps and distributions according to the needs," said Kristin Parco, IOM Health Program Manager. "The needs are still vast in terms of support to the Government of Haiti in responding to cholera."

IOM spokesman Jumbe Omari Jumbe told reporters Fri 16 Nov 2012, in Geneva that the numbers are rising, especially in camps around the capital, Port-au-Prince. He also stated his organization has responded by handing out about 10 000 cholera kits in 31 camps this week. The kits contain oral rehydration salts, aquatabs, and chlorine.

The report also states that "as environmental conditions in Haiti continue to deteriorate, future disasters will continue to affect the country including further loss of human life, property, and livelihoods, and, as with Sandy, cause new internal displacement in a country which still has some 370 000 persons in camps since the January 2010 earthquake."

Cholera is a bacterial infection that spreads through water, and Haiti's lack of proper sanitation and sewage systems makes the country more vulnerable. Haiti was spared a direct hit from Hurricane Sandy on 24 Oct 2012, but received heavy rain for several days.

[A major flooding event such as this storm will almost always produce a significant rise in cases of cholera through the spread of contaminated water. Cholera also becomes more prevalent when there is a drought since people will seek water even if it is contaminated. - Mod.LL
