Avian influenza in the United States of America
-----------------------------------------------
Information received on 9 Feb 2004 from Dr Peter Fernandez, associate
administrator, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), United
States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Washington, DC:
The report is dated 9 Feb 2004. It refers to an animal health incident
first detected on 5 Feb 2004 and the estimated date of primary infection is
2 Feb 2004.
An outbreak of avian influenza was reported in a flock of about 12 000
chickens (all in one house) in Kent County, State of Delaware (north
eastern United States). Mortality rates were within the normal range.
Preliminary testing results using rapid testing procedures and serology
were positive for avian influenza. The avian influenza virus subtype is H7.
Pathogenicity testing is being conducted at the National Veterinary
Services Laboratories (NVSL) in Ames, Iowa.
Source of agent / origin of infection: unknown at this time, but the virus
isolate seems to be the same one as that known to circulate in live bird
markets in the New York City area.
Other epidemiological details:
- birds raised on the premises were being sold specifically to supply the
live bird markets in New York City.
- poultry premises within a 3 km radius of the index farm are being sampled
and tested. To date, all farms tested within this radius are negative for
avian influenza using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR) and agar gel precipitation testing.
Control measures:
- the flock has been completely depopulated.
- USDA-APHIS is working closely with the State of Delaware by conducting
epidemiological investigations and area surveillance testing.
- a quarantine zone has been implemented within a 3 km radius.
