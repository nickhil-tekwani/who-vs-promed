As promised, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have released the final data for West Nile Virus in the US for 2012. According to the federal health agency numbers, "In 2012, all 48 contiguous states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico reported West Nile virus infections in people, birds, or mosquitoes. A total of 5674 cases of West Nile virus disease in people, including 286 deaths, were reported to CDC. Of these, 2873 (51 per cent) were classified as neuroinvasive disease (such as meningitis or encephalitis) and 2801 (49 per cent) were classified as non-neuroinvasive disease. The numbers of neuroinvasive, non-neuroinvasive, and total West Nile virus disease cases reported in 2012 are the highest since 2003." The number of deaths is the highest since cases of WNV disease were 1st detected in the United States in 1999.

In 2012, 62 per cent of all reported West Nile virus cases were concentrated in California, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Oklahoma, South Dakota, and Texas. Texas reported 33 per cent (1877) of all reported West Nile virus cases in 2012. Dallas County, Texas alone accounted for 405 human cases of WNV.

The CDC says, "Last summer's [2012] outbreak likely resulted from many factors, including higher-than-normal temperatures that influenced mosquito and bird abundance, the replication of the virus in its host mosquitoes, and interactions of birds and mosquitoes in hard-hit areas. Because the factors that lead to West Nile virus disease outbreaks are complex, CDC cannot predict where and when they will occur."

New research from the University of Haifa in Israel piggybacks on the CDC's "higher-than-normal temperatures" statement. In the study commissioned by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) in Stockholm, researchers found that rising temperatures have a more considerable contribution than humidity, to the spread of the disease, while the effect of rain was inconclusive.

"These results are an additional testament that global warming contributes to the outbreak of mosquito-borne and other temperature-sensitive vector-borne diseases. The indications to this are piling up in different parts around the globe", says Dr Shlomit Paz, who led this research. These findings were recently published in the online scientific journal, PLoS One.

[West Nile virus has become endemic in the continental USA following its introduction in 1999. Continuing human and equine cases can be expected. It will be interesting to see if there is enough residual immunity in birds following the increased transmission last year (2012) to reduce spill-over infections to people and equine animals.

Although there is no commercially available vaccine for humans, there is for equine animals, so owners should have them vaccinated soon, as the transmission season approaches.

One hopes that state public health continue their campaign to "fight the bite", urging people to avoid mosquito bites and prevent transmission of the virus.
