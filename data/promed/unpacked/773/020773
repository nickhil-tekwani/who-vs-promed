At a glance: the latest HPAI outbreaks for the period 1-31 Oct 2010
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Note: AIDEnews publishes reports of confirmed HPAI cases using the
following sources: OIE, European Commission, FAO and national
governments.

Africa
------
Egypt
A total of 13 H5 HPAI positive cases were reported in 7 governorates
during 1-31 Oct 2010: Alexandria (1), Beni Suef (2), Dakahlia (3),
Fayoum (4), Gharbia (3), Kafr el sheikh (3), Luxor (1), Menoufia (4),
Qualioubia (1) Qina (2), Sharkia (1), Sixth of October (1)
Governorates. (The number of outbreaks in the governorate is in
brackets).

All of the outbreaks were in household poultry, only one household
had vaccination history. A total of 1433 birds in 26 outbreaks were
culled.

Asia
----
Indonesia
The Participatory Disease Surveillance & Response (PDSR) programme
through 33 Local Disease Control Centres covers 71 249 villages in 84
percent of Indonesia's 448 districts and municipalities in 29 of its
33 provinces. During September 2010, PDSR conducted surveillance in
1386 villages (1.9 percent). The overall HPAI incidence was 0.7
infected villages per 1000 villages under surveillance.

Japan
The Ministry of Environment announced that an H5N1 AI virus was found
through the surveillance of wild duck dropping conducted by the
Hokkaido University. The virus was isolated from 2 of the 183 samples
taken on 14 Oct 2010 at Lake Onuma, Wakkanai City (E141.7593,
N45.3788, the centre of the lake not the sampling site). Hokkaido
Prefecture checked farm within 10 km/6.2 mi (1 farm) and no
abnormality found. There is no death of wild birds found in the Onuma
area.

[The FAOAIDEnews issue 71 above, to become available online soon at
<http://www.fao.org/avianflu/en/index.html> (go to "Newsletters and
brochures), includes the following items:
1. Value chain analysis as a tool for avian influenza control,
2. AI research by FAO and partners focused on Qinghai Lake [see
excerpt further],
3. At a Glance (copied above),
4. Summary of confirmed HPAI outbreaks (list of countries infected
since 2003, pertaining to the dates of 1st and latest outbreaks,
animals infected to date, and human cases/death to date).

Item 4 lists 11 countries in Africa, 19 in Asia, 7 in the Near East,
and 26 in Europe. 10 of the affected European countries experienced
H5N1 cases in wild birds only.

The countries which have reported the highest number of human
cases/mortalities are: Indonesia (168/139), Viet Nam (119/59), Egypt
(112/36), China (39/26), and Thailand (25/17).

Interesting observations on the epidemiology of HPAI H5N1 are to be
found in item 2; reflected in the following excerpt.

"In an effort to pinpoint the role that wild birds play in
transboundary disease transmission along major migratory flyways, a
team led by FAO and the US Geological Survey (USGS) has to date
mounted GPS transmitters on more than 525 waterfowl from 24 species
in 11 countries to track their migration by satellite. This and other
investigations began after H5N1 HPAI swept the region in 2005 and
beyond.

"Team researchers now know that the majority of bar-headed geese
tagged at Qinghai Lake spend their winters in the Lhasa region of
Tibet or further south in India. In these wintering grounds, wild
birds have exposure to domestic poultry and potentially, farmed wild
birds; and since H5N1 HPAI outbreaks have been reported here, this
could be an indication of a dissemination pathway for the virus to
move among wildfowl and captive birds, eventually being carried to
places along migration routes.

"If this is so, wild waterfowl on the eastern portion of the Central
Asian Flyway may in fact be helping spread H5N1 HPAI into Mongolia
each spring as they move across the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau to the
north and east. Most interesting is that this repeatable pattern of
wild bird outbreaks at the northern end of their migration pathway
each spring does not appear to be occurring in other major flyways,
thus demonstrating the complexity surrounding the role of wild birds
in the disease epidemiology."

AIDEnews, published monthly by FAO's ECTAD (Emergency Centre for
Transboundary Animal Diseases), is commendable reading. - Mod.AS]
