The article in 'The Hindu' daily from 1 Jun 2003 probably refers to the work
recently carried out by Dr. J. Lindsay Oaks, a US veterinarian with the
College of Veterinary Medicine at Washington State University, who has
established experimentally that at least some vultures in India have died of
diclofenac toxicity, which causes renal failure in the birds (also a
potential but rare side-effect in humans). He recently discussed his findings
at the 6th World Conference on Birds of Prey and Owls, held on 18-23 May 2003
in Budapest, Hungary. [See summary with main points in [2] & [3] below].
India has the largest livestock population in the world. Diclofenac sodium is
widely administered by veterinarians in India in analgesic, antirheumatic and
antimicrobial preparations. Dead livestock (potentially laden with
diclofenac, if they died from or with an illness for which it was
administered) are usually left out in the open for removal by vultures -- the
quickest, cheapest, easiest and most efficient natural disposal method.
There are some questions still to be answered: If diclofenac is the cause,
why only now, and why has it not affected other scavenging birds or mammals
to the same extent?
Dozens of research projects throughout Europe and the USA have demonstrated
the presence of a wide range of pharmaceutical compounds in the aquatic and
terrestrial environments, and diclofenac is one of the most commonly found
drugs in environmental samples. For many drug compounds, a large portion of
the administered dose is not completely metabolised by the body, and the
active compound is excreted either whole or only partially metabolised,
entering sewage systems, or in the case of livestock, reaching soil and
surface waters via manure deposited on the ground. Drug molecules and their
metabolites are often not broken down in sewage treatment plants, and so are
discharged in sewage plant effluent to surface waters, or with sewage sludge
which is spread onto fields as fertiliser or disposed of in landfills. The
removal rate of diclofenac in tertiary treatment plants can be as low as 16
percent.
India has a high population density, and many sewage treatment plants are low-
grade (primary or secondary treatment only) or otherwise inefficient. The
availability of diclofenac has increased greatly in recent years due to
numerous market factors. There is widespread abuse of the prescription laws
which should restrict drug sales, with poor dose controls for humans and
livestock, and this has arguably become more widespread in the past 5 years.
Consequently diclofenac use is high, with potentially significant (for
vultures) environmental concentrations -- both in livestock and in natural
waters. The situation is similar in parts of Cambodia, Nepal and Pakistan.
However if reports of a vulture decline in Afghanistan and Europe are borne
out, other questions will arise.
Regarding other species of scavengers, some have apparently been affected in
small numbers. However, it is likely that vultures have been more
susceptible because they are usually the first to arrive at a carcass, and do
so in such numbers that other scavengers generally have to wait until the
vultures have eaten their fill before they can feed, by which time most of
the soft organs where diclofenac would be concentrated have been eaten. It
could be argued that with a reduction in vulture numbers, other scavengers
should now be susceptible. However, many species can't penetrate the hides of
livestock carcasses, and would normally have to wait for vultures to do most
of the work -- indicated by the numbers of carcasses now left to decay in the
south Asian countryside. Those species which are benefiting from the
abundance of carcasses -- feral dogs and rats -- may be physiologically more
tolerant of exposure to diclofenac, though I doubt that many wild rats or
dogs in India have been examined for renal complications...
There is also the question of the disposal of unused diclofenac (and indeed,
other pharmaceuticals) in India. If large amounts have gone to landfill,
where vultures are common scavengers, then this is another potential route of
exposure. If we assume that diclofenac is the culprit, it may in fact not be
the only toxicant involved -- there must certainly be a range of
pharmaceuticals and other chemicals to which these birds have been exposed.
Perhaps diclofenac on its own would not have had such a significant impact?
Discussions of pharmaceuticals in the environment may be found on the US
EPA website <http://www.epa.gov/esd/chemistry/pharma/index.htm>, and at
. The environmental occurrence of diclofenac is
discussed in several references listed in these web sites.
An interesting discussion of pharmaceutical marketing practices in India
was published in the Wall Street Journal in August 2001 and can be found

New light shed on Indian Vulture Crisis
-------------------------
The widespread mortality and decline of 3 vulture species (_Gyps
bengalensis_, _Gyps indicus_ and _Gyps tenuirostris_) in southern Asia has
been a cause of concern since widely reported in 1999. Following observed
declines in western India, there were reports of further vulture mortalities
in Pakistan, as well as other parts of India. The extent of these declines
varies, but all are significant. At 3 sites in Pakistan, estimates of the
decline in numbers of breeding vultures are between 33 & 97 percent. Survey
transects conducted across India suggest population declines in the region of
92 percent.
Suggested causes have included pesticides, persecution, a novel infectious
disease, and habitat loss. Until recently, the identification of a single
cause has been elusive. A common finding among field workers has been the
presence of visceral gout in many dead vultures, with up to 80 percent of
adult vultures examined post mortem having shown these symptoms. Efforts have
concentrated on establishing the cause of this condition.
At the recent 6th World Conference on Birds of Prey and Owls in Budapest,
Hungary (18-23 May 2003), there was a report of significant new findings. Dr
Lindsay Oakes (Washington State University), an investigator with The
Peregrine Fund (USA), highlighted the role of Diclofenac Sodium, a non-
steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, in relation to vulture mortalities. Based
on these results, it appears that the proximal cause of visceral gout in
affected vultures is this widespread veterinary drug. Contamination of
vultures occurs following the consumption of deceased domestic stock
previously treated with Diclofenac.
To address the crisis, reactive strategies could include an attempted
withdrawal of veterinary Diclofenac from general distribution, the
development of in-country captive facilities and the re-establishment of
wild populations through food provision and field monitoring.
However, given the rate of population declines, it is possible that such
remedial objectives will be too late to avoid local extinctions. Despite
the identification of an obvious cause of vulture mortalities, the current
situation and immediate prognosis for these species remain critically
unfavourable.
The European population is therefore highly significant. For a start, the
vultures in Europe have lived there for at least 15 years, and are
therefore unaffected by the problems currently afflicting wild populations.
Although the likelihood of any future captive population being used for
release is very small, if non-existent, the poor status of wild populations
means that the zoological population has a definite role to play as a
'safety net'. A new captive care and management facility has been opened in
Haryana State (northern India), and if in situ organisations develop more
of these types of facility, it is likely that the captive population will
have an important conservation role to play into the future.

Selected paragraphs from: REPORT ON THE 6th RAPTOR WORLD CONFERENCE
in Budapest (Hungary)
By B.-U. Meyburg & R. D. Chancellor
The outstanding topic of the conference was the population crash of 3
_Gyps_ vulture species in Southern Asia, particularly in India and Pakistan.
Almost one whole day of the vulture session was devoted to this, followed
by a Round Table discussion. Since the disappearance in India of these
vultures, which only a few years ago occurred in huge numbers and which
anyone not directly concerned could scarcely have conceived possible, the
cause has been frantically sought. A lethal virus together with pesticides
was assumed, but without any direct evidence.
The American veterinarian J. Lindsay Oaks and his colleagues have shown that
the cause is to be found in a kidney failure brought about by Diclofenac.
This is an analgesic and antirheumatic drug extensively prescribed for humans
for a long time. For several years, in India and Pakistan, it has been widely
used to treat the livestock which [when dead] form the basic food of the
vultures. It had been proved experimentally that this in turn affected the
three _Gyps species_. Thus Diclofenac, which can also engender serious side-
effects in humans, is in fact the direct cause, borne out, for example, by
the fact that the vultures in Bombay, which fed on the corpses put out by the
Parsees on their Towers of Silence, already disappeared long ago.
It remains unclear why other carrion-eating raptors such as the other vulture
species, kites and eagles are not affected. Much further research is needed
on this subject. Martin Gilbert <Mart_Gilbert@yahoo.com> of the Peregrine
Fund summarised all that was known about Diclofenac and undertook to seek
further information. Whether and how its application to livestock can be
reduced is the next all-important question to be tackled.

[More data on the experiments carried out by the Washington State
University group will be helpful in assessing the significance of the newly
published etiology. Several questions yet to be answered have been
mentioned in Conor Kretsch's commentary.
The definite cause of the vultures die-off in the Indian sub-continent
remains debatable, according to other researchers -- whose opinion, at least
until recently, was that "the chief suspect is a viral disease" -- see
