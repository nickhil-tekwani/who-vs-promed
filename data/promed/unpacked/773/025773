Mystery Disease Fells Hundreds of Wyoming Elk
---------------------------
Since a coyote hunter found 2 paralyzed elk near here [Rawlings, Wyoming]
on 8 Feb 2004, close to 300 elk have been felled by a mysterious illness
that no one can identify.
Wildlife officers have euthanized about 200 of those animals after finding
them starving, dehydrated and unable to move. They took 4 into captivity to
try to nurse them to health and learn more about their illness. [Only one
of the four is still alive.]
"I've never seen anything like this, never even heard of a large die-off in
elk in this extreme," said Joe Nemick, a wildlife management coordinator
who has been with the Wyoming Game and Fish Department for 37 years. "Elk
are generally pretty hardy animals."
Experts here are looking into a range of potential causes. Did the elk
ingest a poison? Did they experience stress from being chased?
About 800 elk typically spend the winter in this region, along the southern
edge of the Red Desert and west of the Continental Divide, about 150 miles
west of Cheyenne. So do wild horses, antelope, deer and some grazing
cattle. No other animals appear to be afflicted, including hundreds of elk
nearby. An estimated 100,000 elk live throughout Wyoming.
After weeks of studying the elk, wildlife biologists and veterinarians have
compiled a list of what did not make the animals sick, and a shorter list
of remaining possibilities.
"This may turn out not to be a single problem, and there may be several
elements involved," said Dr. Walt Cook, a wildlife veterinarian for the
Game and Fish Department. "We may never be able to point to a single cause
for why this happened."
Dr. Cook and other biologists have ruled out chronic wasting disease,
brucellosis and other bacterial and viral diseases; poisoning by a toxic
metal, by toxins in drinking water or from coal-bed methane gas drilling;
salt poisoning; calcium or magnesium deficiency; and parasites.
The research is now focused on the possibility that drought conditions in
recent years produced a toxin in a plant, on a plant or in the soil.
Another theory is that a stress caused the elk to overexert themselves.
"The focus now is on something naturally occurring," said Tom Reed, a
spokesman for the Game and Fish Department. "We feel kind of powerless.
What's going to happen next year if a herd moves in there?"
A puzzling sign is the muscle lesions on the animals' hind legs. They could
indicate a long chase, though there have been no tracks to support that. Or
the lesions could be a result of paralysis, rather than a cause.
"I've seen stuff like this before, but this is the first time in elk,"
said Dr. Merl Raisbeck, a toxicology professor at the University of Wyoming
who is working on the cases. "It's a mystery, all right, and I'd like to
know what the heck it is."

The number of elk dying from a mysterious affliction continues to climb.
With 9 more reported dead in the past week brings the total to 289,
according to Tom Reed of the Wyoming Game and Fish department.
"It's slowed down some but elk are still dying," Reed said.
Four of the elk displaying apparent paralysis and loss of leg muscle
control were transported to the Wyoming State Veterinary Laboratory in
Laramie. Three of those have died, Reed said. "When they're getting hay and
water and still dying, it raises more questions," he said.
Game and Fish [G & F] Department veterinarians hoped they might gain
insight into the mysterious malady from observing how the afflicted elk
responded to various treatments.
"They were given all kinds of supplements and still died so we've pretty
much eliminated some type of deficiency," Reed said.
The state veterinarian and the G&F officials continue to direct all
available resources to trying to determine the cause for elk deaths, first
reported on 8 Feb 2004 when a coyote hunter found 2 elk approximately 15
miles from Rawlins that were alive but unable to move.
"We're still keying in on some sort of toxin. Many things have been
eliminated like insecticides. It's a slow process but eventually something
will just pop up," Reed said.
Personnel have now ruled out calcium deficiency, chronic wasting disease,
bacterial and common viral infections, tick paralysis, meningeal and
carotid artery worm as causes. Mercury poisoning, selenium toxicity, many
of the common plant toxins, a variety of metals and salt, nitrate and
sulfate poisoning have also been eliminated.
Another thing officials have dismissed is that someone ran the animals to
death. Reed said that theory is pretty much off the table.
"For one thing, if that had happened, elk wouldn't still be going down,"
Reed said, adding it would be impossible to chase them with snowmobiles
because there is no snow.
He also said chasing them with a vehicle would be near impossible because
of the rugged terrain and mud.
Reed said areas 21 and 108 where the afflicted elk are located are popular
hunt areas, and game and fish will be looking at the number of tags issued
for the fall hunt.
"It's uncertain right now, but we may reduce the number of licenses for
cows," he said.

[This is tragic and baffling. Some of the natural toxicology theories were
tried in mice, but mice may be a poor biological model for elk. This
appears to too wide spread to be a toxic issue, other than one occurring
naturally, as through a plant. - Mod.TG]
