The number of death certificates in England and Wales mentioning
_Clostridium difficile_ infection has increased every year from 1999
to 2005. In 2005, there were 3807 death certificates which mentioned
_C. difficile_, a 69 percent increase from 2004. Among death
certificates with a mention of _C. difficile_, the percentage for
which it was the underlying cause of death was similar in each year
(around 55 percent). [A graph of the statistics can be found at the
original URL. - Mod.LL]
Age-standardized rates for both males and females increased over the
period 1999 to 2005. The rate for deaths involving _C. difficile_ in
males increased from 23 per million population in 2004, to 38 per
million in 2005. In females the rate for deaths involving _C.
difficile_ increased from 23 to 39 per million population over the same period.
Most of the deaths were at older ages. Mortality rates in 2005 for
deaths involving the organism in the 85 and over age group were 1580
and 1812 deaths per million population for males and females
respectively. In the under 45 age group there were 0.2 deaths per
million population for both males and females.

[The dramatic increases in deaths linked, at least in part, to _C.
difficile_ are underscored by this posting. How big a role the
hypertoxin producer, ribotype 027, plays in this is not immediately
clear. - Mod.LL]
