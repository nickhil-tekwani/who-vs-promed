A Dunnellon horse is infected with the potentially deadly eastern
equine encephalitis (EEE) virus, making it the 1st infected animal
reported in Marion County for the year [2007], county Health
Department officials said Monday [23 Apr 2007].
The diseased horse is still alive, said Tom Moore, Marion County
Health Department environmental administrator, and so far it is the
4th case of the mosquito-spread disease this year [2007] in Florida.
"This being a tropical climate, Florida is an active environment,"
Moore said. "But there has not been one development in humans."
In 2006, there were 3 cases of horse infections in Marion County and
14 cases the year before [2005]. According to Florida Department of
Health officials, there has not been a human case of EEE infection in
Marion County since 1992, which is as far back as the agency's
computer records extend.
But humans occasionally are infected with the virus or by the similar
West Nile Virus (WNV), which is also spread by mosquitoes.
As for EEE, there were 65 human cases reported in Florida between
1964 and 2005, according to the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC). During that same period, there were 242 cases
reported throughout the United States.
The mortality rate for people infected by the virus is high. About 30
percent of people who contract the disease die, making it one of the
most serious mosquito-borne diseases in the United States. Moore said
the mortality rate among horses is about 75 percent.
There were more cases of EEE reported in Florida than any other
state, according to the CDC.
The last case of the closely related West Nile Virus in Marion County
was in 2005.
Many people infected with the EEE virus show no symptoms. For those
who do show symptoms, they range from mild flu-like illness to
inflammation of the brain, coma and death, according to the CDC.
There is no specific treatment for EEE. Medical care includes
hospitalization and supportive care such as respiratory support and
the prevention of secondary bacterial infections. About half of the
people who survive EEE will have mild to severe permanent
neurological damage, according to the CDC.
There is no vaccine available to protect humans from infection, but
there is one for horses. In addition, many of the farms in the Ocala
area take additional precautions to protect their horses.
Tony Everard, owner of New Episode Training Center, said his farm
uses automatic bug sprays to keep insects out of his horse barns. The
Everard farm also uses large fans to blow potentially dangerous
insects out of areas where horses spend most of their time.
As for what people can do to avoid infection: avoid mosquito bites by
using a government-approved repellent, wear protective clothing,
avoid outdoor activities when mosquitoes are active, and remove
standing water that could provide mosquito breeding sites.
EEE virus is transmitted to humans through the bite of an infected
mosquito. It generally takes from 3 to 10 days to develop symptoms of
EEE. But the most prevalent EEE virus transmission cycle is between
birds and mosquitoes.
Transmission to horses or humans usually requires a 2nd mosquito
species capable of creating a "bridge" between infected birds and
uninfected mammals. EEE virus infections in horses, however, are not
a significant risk for humans because horses are considered to be
"dead-end" hosts for the virus because the amount of virus in their
bloodstreams is usually insufficient to infect mosquitoes.

[EEE is appearing early in the year. But then, it is almost year
around in Florida. West Nile virus took a lot of press several years
ago, and caused some panic in horse owners. A vaccine alleviated some
of the fear. Owners could easily protect their horses from EEE and
from WNV with a single injection. WNV, EEE, and WEE (Western Equine
Encephalitis) are combined in one vaccine. A vaccine containing these
and Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis (VEE) is also available. - Mod.TG
