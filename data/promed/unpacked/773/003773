The Norway Institute of Public Health reports investigating an outbreak of gastrointestinal bacterium, _Yersinia enterocolitica_ O:9. To date [Sat 7 Jul 2018], 18 people from several counties have been diagnosed with the infection. The patients are between 13 and 60 years old and 60 percent of them are women. They are residents from Troms, Oslo, Akershus, Trøndelag, Vestfold, Rogaland, Nordland, Hordaland and Møre og Romsdal, and are tested in May and early June [2018]. Bacteria with similar DNA profiles have been detected in all 18 individuals.

Health and Food Safety officials are trying to determine if there is a common source of infection. Interviews are conducted with the patients, and samples from the homes are taken to find the source of infection, if possible. "Investigations can be complicated and take time, and in many cases you will not be able to find the source of infection or to clarify if there is a common source", says Solveig Jore Senior Adviser.

The most common symptoms of yersiniosis are diarrhea, fever and abdominal pain, usually of 1-3 weeks duration. The reservoir for the bacterium is primarily pig. Dogs and cats can also be carriers of the bacterium. _Yersinia_ bacteria mainly contaminate food, usually via infected pork products, contaminated vegetables or salads, and the use of non-disinfected drinking water.

Every year, between 40 and 80 cases are reported to the Public Health Institute of Yersiniosis. Most cases are acquired domestically (70-75 percent of reported cases).

[The 2 species of _Yersinia_ associated with food-borne disease are _pseudotuberculosis_ and _enterocolitica_. The latter species, can be associated with abdominal pain as a hallmark symptom. As a mesenteric lymphadenitis, yersiniosis can mimic appendicitis but may also cause infections of other sites such as wounds, joints, and the urinary tract.

As noted in the FDA "Bad Bug Book" http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~mow/chap5.html, "Strains of _Y. enterocolitica_ can be found in meats (pork, beef, lamb, etc.), oysters, fish, and raw milk. The exact cause of the food contamination is unknown. However, the prevalence of this organism in the soil and water and in animals such as beavers, pigs, and squirrels, offers ample opportunities for it to enter our food supply. Poor sanitation and improper sterilization techniques by food handlers, including improper storage, cannot be overlooked as contributing to contamination." Additionally, some strains of these organisms can be associated with blood transfusion-associated illnesses due to an ability to grow at refrigerator temperatures. - Mod.LL
