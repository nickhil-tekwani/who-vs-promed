The Winter Course in Infectious Diseases and the University of
Nebraska Medical Center, Center for Continuing Education are pleased
to announce the 38th Remington Winter Course in Infectious Diseases
will take place 12-17 Feb 2012 at the Viceroy Hotel in Snowmass,
Colorado.

This comprehensive 6-day course is designed to educate healthcare
professionals about the latest advances in the epidemiology,
diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of infectious diseases. Topics
will be presented in lectures, panel discussions, debates, case
presentations, and question and answer sessions. Meet the professor
sessions will allow for personal exchange between participants and
faculty.

This year's areas of focus will include:
- Best practices for treating infection in immunocompromised
transplant recipients, particularly with regard to
multi-drug-resistant pathogens.
- Identification of patients who are at increased risk for
opportunistic fungal infections or endemic mycoses and review of
tailored treatments that include pharmacological and, when necessary,
surgical interventions.
- Optimal treatment guidelines for preventing and treating
opportunistic infections in patients with HIV/AIDS and monitoring
recommendations for patients receiving HAART [highly active
antiretroviral treatment].
- Treatment strategies and alternatives for drug-resistant infections
such as MRSA, VRE, _Acinetobacter_, and NDM-1 producing
Enterobacteriaceae, as well as infection control recommendations.
- Optimal infection control protocols to reduce exposure to
_Clostridium difficile_ and treatment strategies for resistant and
relapsed infection.
- Appropriate use of monotherapy and combination therapy for treatment
of hepatitis C virus based on individual patient and disease factors.
- Emerging antibiotic resistance and reduced susceptibility in gram
positive and gram negative pathogens and the use of
pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic principles in achieving effective
therapy.
- Application of new information gained from broad topic updates in
areas of interest to ID specialists and internal medicine physicians,
including influenza, CAP/VAP [community-acquired
pneumonia/ventilator-associated pneumonia], urinary tract infections,
herpes viruses, meningitis, and emerging infections
