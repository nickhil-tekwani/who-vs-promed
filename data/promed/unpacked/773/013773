NZFSA updates BSE importing requirements
----------------------------------------
New Zealand Food Safety Authority (NZFSA) has moved to modernise the food
safety importing requirements for beef and beef products in light of the
new science and practical knowledge that now surrounds bovine spongiform
encephalopathy (BSE).
The changes reflect recent findings from the growing body of science that
more accurately identifies the risks and measures required to protect
consumers from variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD), the human disease
that has been linked to eating beef offal containing the BSE agent.
"The old measures, in place since 1996 and adopted internationally as well
as by New Zealand, reflected a precautionary approach which was taken
during a time of uncertainty," explains Tim Knox, NZFSA's New Zealand
standards director. "However, in the intervening years much has been
learned about BSE and the risks to human health which has increased our
understanding and virtually eliminated the risk of consumers contacting vCJD."
The new measures have undergone a comprehensive process of review and
expert consideration to ensure they are consistent with scientific evidence
and the emerging international standards. As a result New Zealand will move
to an internationally agreed 3-category system for categorising the BSE
risk status of those countries exporting beef and or beef-related products
to New Zealand.
* adopt international risk assessments rather than conducting its own
* exclude offal that has been identified as BSE risk material from any
country with a residual risk of BSE
* exempt processed foods that contain minimal bovine ingredients from those
commodities that are covered by the measure
* adopt a consistent framework for determining the acceptability of
imported products and the need for any certification
* remove age restrictions on the source of commodities and not specify
measures to provide for traceability
* allow all gelatine to be traded freely, regardless of the source raw
material and exporting country's BSE risk status.
Gelatine derived from bones was originally considered a risk because of
fears that it could contain the BSE prion. However, recent studies have
confirmed that chemical processes used in its manufacture are sufficient to
inactivate any BSE infectivity that may have been present in the raw
material, even under worst-case conditions. "Gelatine produced by modern
industrial processes does not pose a BSE risk to consumers, regardless of
the raw material from which it is produced and the source country from
which it is derived," explains Mr Knox.
The new requirements will come into effect on 29 Jun 2007 although gelatine
will be freely traded before then.
Strict controls have been in place for beef products around the world since
1996 when vCJD was linked to eating beef products contaminated with offal
that had come from cattle with BSE in the 1980s. Since that time, however,
changes to production rules (such as not feeding ruminant material to
ruminants and removing the parts of the animal from the food chain that
could contain the BSE agent) have dramatically reduced the incidence of BSE.
The new requirements are not related to New Zealand's domestic animal
health measures regarding BSE and will not override current animal health
requirements, such as the ruminant-to-ruminant feed ban.
New Zealand has been classified as BSE-free by the World Organisation for
Animal Health (OIE) and is regarded by the European Food Safety Authority
as a country in which BSE is "highly unlikely" to be present.
