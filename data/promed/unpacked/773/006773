[On March 31 Steve Osofsky <sosofsky@usaid.gov> raised a significant query
about the initial report sent us by Mary Brown <mnb9@NIOPSE1.EM.CDC.GOV>
that had been derived from the 'Online news' media ... he commented that the
condition was very probably contagious bovine pleuro-pneumonia and not FMD
as reported. Mary requested a clarification from ANC. The following was
received yesterday from FAO. MHJ]

Dear Dr. Benkirane
FOOT AND MOUTH DISEASE: CONTROL - BOTSWANA:
Thank you very much for sending us this information and your concern about
this inaccurate and potentially misleading article.
As you are aware, there was no Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) outbreak in
Botswana last year. The last outbreak of this disease in this country was in
1980. The border fence between us and Zimbabwe has existed since the time
immemorial.
The relocation of Buffaloes from the livestock area to stock free area is a
joint undertaking between Department of Wildlife and National Parks and that
of Animal Health and Production. These buffaloes do not form any part of
annual migration as suggested by the article but rather were introduced into
the livestock side by:
(i) The gap that was strategically and purposefully left during fence
construction for the very function that is now being used for.
(ii) Some buffaloes had gone through the fence after the elephants had
uprooted the fence.
(iii) Some find their way into the livestock side when in flight from
predators such as lions.
Indeed the buffaloes are known carriers of FMD viruses.
The border fence is being re-inforced between Botswana and Namibia and
Namibia and Not Botswana and Zimbabwe. As I indicate, the latter has existed
for more than a decade now.
