Kenya: Rift Valley fever death toll rises to 95
-----------------------------------------------
The death toll from the outbreak of Rift Valley fever in Kenya has risen to
95 people, a government spokesman said on Thu [18 Jan 2007]. The contagious
disease hit remote areas of Kenya's North East and Coastal provinces in
mid-December 2006 and has since spread to neighboring Somalia. The country
has recorded nearly 60 new human infections since the end of last week.
"The government has already spent 100 million shillings [USD 1.43 million]
to provide medical care for affected areas, and 2 million heads of cattle
have already been vaccinated," Alfred Mutua, the government's spokesman
told a news conference. Health officials at the Kenyan Dadaab refugee camp,
a densely populated camp near the border with Somalia, said 29 cases,
including 5 deaths, had been reported by Thu [18 Jan 2007].
The disease is transmitted to humans through mosquito bites or frequent
contact with contaminated animals. Although transmission from animals to
humans is rare, the disease develops into a much more severe illness once
it crosses over, causing victims to abort, vomit blood or bleed to death.
The government asked people to avoid contact with animals, especially cows,
to use mosquito nets and to take extra care with their personal hygiene. A
similar outbreak in 1997-1998 killed hundreds of people in Kenya.
