The community in Arua District has been put on high alert over an
outbreak of the deadly bubonic plague disease that killed 17 people in
2008. In this regard, the Ministry of Health in collaboration with the
Arua health team has launched a campaign to educate the community on
causes, signs and symptoms and prevention of the deadly disease.

The District Health Officer, Dr Patrick Anguzu, said the campaign is a
precautionary measure in case of any outbreak. "Our community must
keep their environment clean especially the houses, because the rats
that transmit the disease thrive in unclean environment."

Dr Anguzu told the Daily Monitor that no new case of the disease has
yet been reported in the district in 2009. The 2008 statistics from
Arua health office indicate that 73 cases of human infections and 17
deaths were reported, the highest figure in 2 years. Dr Anguzu added
that 29 [of those] cases have since been confirmed to be of the
bubonic variety.

The community sensitisation campaign is being carried out in the
disease-prone areas of Vurra and Logiri. But even then, the
surrounding area of Kango Sub-county in Nebbi, which borders Logiri,
must not be left out. Historically, the bubonic plague is reported to
have originated from the Democratic Republic of Congo, especially from
Aru and Ariwara.

The campaign, Dr Anguzu said, is aimed at educating residents who keep
pets like cats, which are also susceptible to plague. In this case,
infected cats become sick and may directly transmit plague to people
who handle or care for them.
