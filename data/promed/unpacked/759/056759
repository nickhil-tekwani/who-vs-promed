Calicivirus Program Tasmania co-ordinator Mick Statham said yesterday the
virus [Rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus so far had yielded disappointing
results in temperate south-eastern Australia. Released in Tasmania last
April, it has not lived up to expectations. When first introduced it was
hoped the virus would kill up to 95% of rabbits but the actual kill was
estimated to be about 60%.
Dr Statham said that to combat the disappointing results and to augment the
potency of the virus in temperate climates, scientists were embarking on a
national program to find out if the cooler states needed a new super-strain
or a new dose of the virus. Tasmanian experts also would be looking at ways
to make the virus more effective.
Poorer-than-expected results in south-eastern Australia were accompanied by
great success in more arid regions. Dr Statham said that despite the virus
not living up to original expectations in Tasmania, the results were
reasonable. In just the past two to three months the virus had spread
through the Midlands. "When we were originally spreading the virus in the
target South Arm area we counted about 100 rabbits a square kilometre," he
said. Now it appears to be about 30 a square kilometre so we probably have
reduced the population there by about two-thirds." Dr Statham said it was
harder to assess how the virus had spread through the rest of the state.
"There may be a variety of reasons why we do not get the spread of the
virus you see in some other states," he said. "In Tasmania we do not get
the insect spread you see in some warmer climates. We also have predators
such as devils, cats and birds of prey feeding on dead rabbits, reducing
the possibility of spread once again as insects can't feed on them, but it
is still much of a mystery why the virus has not taken off as we expected."
Another theory to be investigated was that rabbits in temperate areas have
more food and produce more offspring, [thus out-breeding the virus.

[This is the latest in a long series of messages and announcements about
rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus release in Australia and New Zealand that
we have posted on ProMED-mail. Looks like the dire circumstances predicted
by some have not occurred and that, instead, it appears as though the virus
needs a boost in its pathogenicity.
When a rabbit can "outbreed" a virus, let me know.
And no, this posting is not a sign that ProMED-mail is ready to accept
anti-Australian government diatribes. Nonetheless, I hold my finger near
the "Delete" button, just in case. - Mod.CHC
