We read with interest Dr. McLean's information about the effect West Nile
virus has on the avian reservoir. We in Illinois routinely test various
wild bird species for St. Louis encephalitis, eastern equine and western
equine viruses. Do West Nile and St. Louis encephalitis viruses produce
cross-reacting antibodies in birds as they do in humans? Our lab uses the
HI [hemagglutination-inhibition test for avian serology.
We will soon be deciding on arbovirus surveillance for 2000. If West Nile
virus cross reacts with St. Louis encephalitis virus, then we may not need
to add a whole new screening test for West Nile virus, but rather determine
if our St. Louis encephalitis virus reactors are truly St. Louis
encephalitis virus infections or if they are cross-reacting West Nile virus
infections.

[Excellent and useful question! Yes, WNV and SLEV cross-react in many
tests. If you are using either HI or IgG ELISA, antibody to WNV will react
with SLEV antigen and vice versa. An IgG ELISA in this scenario is that
the usual configuration requires (a) coating with antigen, (b) adding the
test serum, then (c) adding an anti-species conjugate (and substrate). The
problem is that one must have an antispecies conjugate that will react with
serum of the species being tested. For most routine tests in cities,
anti-passerine conjugate would react with house sparrow and other perching
birds but one does not know for certain that it would react with all
species being tested. Even an anti-chicken conjugate would be reasonably,
but not definitively, useful. Therefore, unless one has a series of
conjugates, or limits the range of species being tested, the usefulness of
such an IgG ELISA would be minimized. I understand that U.S.D.A. is
preparing a series of antibodies to various avian species but I do not know
when they would become available or whether they will be made available to
state and other government testing laboratories. Therefore, the HI tests
might very well be the best test to use at this point.
As Carl mentioned, WNV need not necessarily be added to the routine battery
of antigens used, so long as SLEV antigen is one of those included. I am
certain that one would miss low titer antibody to WNV but if one or two
very low titer positives is all there are, that might be tolerable. Still,
it is clear that we in the U.S. must now concern ourselves with the
possibility that a serum from a bird that reacts with SLEV antigen by HI
might indeed be from a bird with antibody to WNV. This requires that, for
a period of time, all samples that test positive by HI using SLEV antigen
be confirmed by neutralization. Such confirmation is always the case but
it is particularly true these days.
There is some risk involved in introducing WNV to a laboratory that does
not now have it. I do not know what the federal guidelines are at this
moment but I expect they would not look favorably on many laboratories
having WNV. However, the other side of such a coin would be that C.D.C.
would then have to do confirmatory neutralization testing for all state and
local laboratories that detect antibody using SLEV antigen. IgM antibody
in birds can be detected by ELISA (Calisher, C.H., H.N. Fremount, W.L.
Vesely, A.O. El-Kafrawi, and M.I. Al-D. Mahmud. 1986. Relevance of
detection of immunoglobulin M antibody response in birds used for arbovirus
surveillance. J. Clin. Microbiol. 24:770-774) but it is not a completely
satisfactory test for use with all bird species.
Confirmation of all SLEV seropositives from throughout the U.S. would be a
huge task and I simply do not know how this is being worked out. I suggest
that those involved with such surveillance contact the Division of
Vector-Borne Infectious Diseases in Fort Collins and ask. Meanwhile, the
usual tests can be continue and should suffice. I believe that positive
serologies and sharp ornithological observations in the field will be
warning enough that something is afoot. - Mod.CHC
