[Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) virus is primarily transmitted to people by ticks carried by livestock. Human-to-human transmission can occur resulting from close contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected persons. CCHF is endemic in Africa, the Balkans, the Middle East and Asia, in countries south of the 50th parallel north. There is no vaccine available for either people or animals. Livestock is relatively unharmed by CCHF virus infection.

Amreli district is one of the 26 administrative districts of the state of Gujarat in western India. The district headquarters are located at Amreli. The district occupies an area of 6760 square km and has a population of 1 393 918, of which 22.45 percent were urban (as of 2001). - Mod.CP
