[1] Cholera - Somalia
Date: Fri 30 Nov 2018
Source: Outbreak News Today [edited]
http://outbreaknewstoday.com/somalia-cholera-outbreak-one-year-later-65787/


The Ministry of Health of Somalia has announced 27 new suspected cases of cholera, with one death, reported in Banadir region for epidemiological week 46 (12 to 18 Nov) of 2018. Of these new cases, 44% (12) are female, and 44% (12) are children below 5 years of age.

During this reporting period, of the 7 stool samples collected from suspected cholera cases and tested in the National Public Health Laboratory (NPHL), 6 samples were positive for _Vibrio cholera_, serotype O1 Ogawa. The cumulative total of cases is 6587, including 45 associated deaths (case-fatality rate, 0.7%), since the beginning of the current outbreak in December 2017 along the Shabelle River.

The number of weekly suspected cases has declined from a peak of 296 cases in epidemiological week 23 to 27 cases this week. For the past 3 weeks, the number of reported weekly cases ranges between 19 and 27. Only Banadir region has reported cases for 6 consecutive weeks, and this week active transmission of suspected cholera cases has been reported in 7 districts in Banadir: Darkenley, Daynile, Hawlwadag, Hodan, Karran, Madina, and Waberi. None of the cases reported this week had received the oral cholera vaccination (OCV) in 2017.

WHO is providing leadership and support to the Ministry of Health response efforts to this continued outbreak. WHO has continued to support clinical care delivery, including supervision and monitoring of case management in cholera treatment centers. Surveillance and prompt rumour investigation have been ongoing. All alerts have been responded to across the country through the early warning alert and response network (EWARN), and routine collection and analysis of stool samples have continued at the NPHL. An OCV campaign has been planned for February 2019, targeting 660 000 people living in internal displaced person camps in 6 high-risk districts in Lower Jubba, Middle Shabelle, Lower Shabelle, and Banadir regions. Also, an expansion of reporting sites through the EWARN system has been planned, adding another 400 health facilities in the country.

[2] Cholera - Zimbabwe (Mashonaland Central province)
Date: Tue 27 Nov 2018

Zimbabwe has been hit by another cholera outbreak, hardly 3 months after more than 50 people died of the disease. More than 20 people have reportedly been infected in the rural town of Mt. Darwin, near the border with Mozambique. Authorities recently announced that the disease had been contained. At the height of the outbreak in September 2018, authorities enforced a state of emergency, banned public gatherings and shut down schools before WHO and other organisations provided help to control the disease.

On Tuesday [27 Nov 2018] The Herald reported that all 20 cases were reported at Mukaradzi Mine. The state daily report said all the patients were being treated at Mt. Darwin District Hospital. Health minister Dr. Obadiah Moyo was expected to give details on the severity of the outbreak. Finance minister Mthuli Ncube, whose ministry mobilized ZWD 35 million (USD 96 700) to fight cholera in September 2018, said: "We have all the systems in place in terms of the capacity and capability to respond. Our response mechanisms to such outbreaks are always ready, and together with the ministry of health we will announce interventions that will be put in place to ensure that the disease does not lead to loss of lives and the devastating effect it had last time out." Environment and tourism minister Prisca Mupfumira, a member of a cabinet committee on responses to disasters, said this time government would not let the disease spread.

Zimbabwe had its biggest cholera outbreak in 2008 at the height of an economic crisis when more than 4000 people died and another 40 000 reported for treatment. 2018's outbreak caused 54 deaths, and more 10 000 people were treated for the water-borne disease.

The government said last month [October 2018] it would vaccinate 1.4 million people. The outbreak has exposed lack of maintenance of infrastructure with burst pipes and contaminated boreholes commonplace in the economically ravaged country.

Again, 13 (57%) of 23 samples cultured were positive for _Vibrio cholerae_. However, 9 positive samples were taken to the national reference laboratory for quality checks and further analysis of samples. _V. cholerae_ O1 (Inaba) serotype was isolated in 4 of the 9 samples.

[The mortality from cholera and most diarrheal illnesses is related to non-replacement of fluid and electrolytes from the diarrheal illness.

As stated in Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In: Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2018, pp 113-127, oral rehydration therapy can be lifesaving in outbreaks of cholera and other forms of diarrhea:

"As reviewed by Guerrant et al. (1), it was in 1831 that cholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement, and, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not until 1960 was it 1st recognized that there was no true destruction of the intestinal mucosa, gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could be effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the intravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could be just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube [e.g., (2) and (3)] made it possible for oral rehydration therapy (ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact the morbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant et al. (1) highlight the use of oral glucose-salt packets in war-torn Bangladeshi refugees, which reduced the mortality rate from 30% to 3.6% (4), and quote sources referring to ORT as "potentially the most important medical advance" of the 20th century. A variety of formulations of ORT exist, generally glucose or rice powder-based, which contain a variety of micronutrients, especially zinc (5).

"The assessment of the degree of volume loss in those with diarrhea to approximate volume and fluid losses can be found in the WHO publication (6). Those with severe hypovolemia should be initially rehydrated intravenously with a fluid bolus of normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution of 20 to 30 mL/kg followed by 100 mL/kg in the first 4 hours and 100 mL/kg over the next 18 hours with regular reassessment. Those with lesser degrees of hypovolemia can be rehydrated orally with a glucose or rice-derived formula with up to 4 L in the first 4 hours, and those with no hypovolemia can be given ORT after each liquid stool with frequent reevaluation."
