Kenyan Relative of Ugandan Ebola Fever Victim Now Under Observation
-------------------------------------------------------------------
BUSIA: Kenyan health authorities said on Wed 15 Nov 2000 that they were
carrying out urgent tests on a man they fear may have contracted the deadly
Ebola virus at a funeral in Uganda. Dr. Walter Kayawaya of Busia District
Hospital in western Kenya said hospital workers had confined a man after he
fell ill following his return from Uganda last week. Uganda's Health
Ministry warned Kenyan authorities on Tue 14 Nov 2000 that 7 Kenyan
nationals may have come into contact with the virus when they attended the
burial in Uganda of a female relative who had died of Ebola hemorrhagic
fever. The patient now under observation is one of the 7. Ugandan officials
said earlier this week the woman had unwittingly spread the epidemic when
she fled the center of the outbreak in the northern Ugandan town of Gulu to
her home district in a vain attempt to escape the disease.
