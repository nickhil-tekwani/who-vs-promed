Plague Found in Dead Denver Squirrel
-----------------------------------------
State health officials Thursday confirmed that plague has been found
in a dead tree squirrel in the vicinity of City Park. A citizen had
noticed a die-off of squirrels in the neighborhood and reported it to
Denver Animal Control. A carcass was collected Wednesday and tested
at the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment
laboratory where preliminary tests were positive for plague.
John Pape, an epidemiologist who specializes in animal-related
diseases for the department's Disease Control and Environmental
Epidemiology Division, said, "Plague is a disease seen every year
among rodent populations in rural areas of Colorado, including the
Front Range. It is unusual to find plague in the center of an urban
area although it has happened before." In Colorado, plague-infected
animals are most likely found in the foothills and mountains, he
added.
According to Pape, "Plague [bacteria are] maintained in various
species of rodents and rabbits and transmitted by fleas. When an
infected rodent becomes sick and dies, its fleas can carry the
infection to other warm-blooded animals, including humans. People
also can be exposed through direct contact with infected rodents,
rabbits and cats."
"The risk of Denver residents contracting plague is extremely low,"
said Denver Public Health Director Dr. Chris Urbina. "We want people
to be aware of what to look for and take a few simple precautions to
further reduce that risk." He indicated that Denver Health, the
Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment and Denver
Environmental Health are working together to investigate the case and
to determine the extent of the die-off in the area.
When plague appears in an area, there is usually a die-off of the
rodents and rabbits. When the animal dies, the fleas leave the
carcass to find another host thus spreading the disease. Most human
plague cases result from infected fleabites. Less commonly, people
are infected by direct contact with blood from an infected animal or
from cats which can become infected and transmit the disease.
People should not directly handle any dead rodents they find and
should keep their pets away from them. If a dead rodent is found, do
not handle the animal directly. Use gloves and place in a plastic
bag. Contact CO-HELP (Colorado Health Education Line for the Public)
at 1-877-462-2911 to report a dead rodent or rabbit. Although the
illness is severe and potentially life threatening, human cases occur
infrequently and plague is easily treated with common antibiotics
when recognized early.
Dr. Urbina said that after 2-6 days after being infected, people
become very ill with the following symptoms:
A sudden onset of high fever;
Muscle pain;
Malaise; or a general feeling of being ill;
Nausea and vomiting.
"With bubonic plague, individuals develop a large, swollen, painful
lymph node called a bubo in the area of the flea bite, usually in the
groin or armpit," he explained. "If untreated, the disease can enter
the bloodstream (septicemic plague) or lungs (pneumonic plague) which
are severe, life-threatening complications."
According to Pape, since 1957, 58 cases of human plague, 9 (15.5
percent) of which were fatal, have been confirmed in Colorado. In
2004, 3 human cases of plague were reported, including one fatality.
Hunters infected while cleaning rabbits comprised 2 of these cases,
and another person was infected by a fleabite while camping. A total
of 4 cases was reported in both 2005 and 2006; none of these 8 cases
was fatal. Most were infected by fleabites from around their home.
Plague was identified last year in wild animals from 25 Colorado
counties, according to Pape. Veterinarians' diagnosed 23
plague-infected cats, which are highly susceptible to plague and are
usually infected from eating rodents. Cats with plague become
extremely ill and develop an illness very similar to people with high
fever and swollen lymph nodes.
Owners are advised to contact their veterinarian if they see these
signs in a cat, especially cats known to hunt rodents. Dogs are
generally resistant to plague but can bring infected fleas into the
home.
Pape and Urbina offered the following precautions for Denver citizens to take:
Do not feed squirrels or other rodents. This brings them onto your
property and in close contact with each other increasing the risk of
disease transmission;
Rodent-proof houses and outbuildings;
Don't let dogs or cats catch or eat squirrels;
Do not allow pets to roam freely, and keep them treated for fleas
according to a veterinarian's advice;
Be aware of rodent and rabbit populations in your area and report
sudden die-offs or multiple dead animals;
Contact your physician if you develop a high fever and other plague
symptoms following a fleabite or direct contact with dead rodents or
rabbits.

[The causative bacterium _Yersinia pestis_ is transmitted to people
through flea bite and direct contact with infected animals. Each
rodent species is host to one or more species of fleas which, when
infected, are carriers. These fleas generally do not infest other
animals unless their natural hosts are unavailable. Rock squirrels
(_Spermophilus variegates_) are closely related to California ground
squirrels and are the most significant plague host in Colorado. Their
principal flea _Diamanus montanus_ is an aggressive parasite and will
readily bite other animals and people. Domestic cats and dogs can
also contract plague by infective fleas. They may carry infected
fleas home to their owners or, especially with cats, serve as a
direct source of infection.
In humans, the incubation period (interval between exposure and
appearance of symptoms) is usually 2-6 days. Typical symptoms include
sudden onset of fever and chills, severe headache, muscle aches,
nausea, vomiting and a general feeling of systemic illness. Extreme
pain and swelling in a lymph node draining the infection site is a
suggestive symptom of bubonic plague. (The swollen, painful node is
called a "bubo"). Other forms of the disease include septicemic
illness with no bubo developing, and pneumonic plague in which the
lungs are involved. The septicemic and pneumonic forms are the most
serious. In addition, pneumonic plague can be spread by inhalation of
infective droplets expelled by another human or animal with plague
pneumonia.
Treatment with antibiotics is effective during the early stages of
disease. If diagnosis and appropriate treatment are delayed,
life-threatening complications may follow. A doctor or hospital
emergency room should be consulted as soon as symptoms appear and a
history of exposure to potentially infected animals is very important
in evaluating the risk from plague. Anti-plague vaccine is not
readily available. It may be advantageous for researchers or people
working with plague-infected animals to be vaccinated but it is not
indicated for the general public.
It is an opportune time to remember to treat your pets, cats and dogs
with appropriate flea control. There are many excellent choices of
products to rid your pet of fleas. Be sure to consult your
veterinarian as some products may be toxic to cats, kittens and
puppies, even resulting in fatalities.
According to:

One human case was reported in conjunction with a previous outbreak of plague
among urban populations of fox squirrels (_Scirus niger_) in Denver
during 1968.
