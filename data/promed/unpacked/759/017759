Dengue type 3 virus infection - Brazil (Rio de Janeiro)
-------------------------------------------------------
On Fri 23 Mar 2001 a case [of infection with dengue type 3 (DEN-3) virus
was reported in Leblon, in the Zona Sul of the city of Rio de Janeiro.
Brazil and Rio de Janeiro have previously suffered outbreaks due to DEN-1
and DEN-2 viruses. According to the State Secretary of Health there is
currently an outbreak of DEN-1 in Niteroi, across the bay bridge from Rio,
and of DEN-2 in Tres Rios, 123 km inland from Rio de Janeiro. Because there
is no immunity in the population to DEN-3, the whole population is
susceptible. There is also the danger that an infection with DEN-3 in an
individual already immune to one of the other types could trigger dengue
hemorrhagic fever (DHF). Anti-mosquito measures are being intensified in
the area. This is the second case to be reported in Brazil. [The first was
in Nova Iguacu, Rio de Janeiro state, in January 2001. - Mod.JW

[According to an article in CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report at
the time, on 25 Nov 1994 "the Ministry of Health of Nicaragua announced the
isolation of Dengue type 3 (DEN-3) virus from 2 children hospitalized with
minor hemorrhagic manifestations in Managua [Nicaragua. Subsequently,
DEN-3 virus was isolated from 2 persons with dengue fever in Panama. These
cases represent[ed the first isolations of DEN-3 virus from autochthonous
cases in the Americas since 1977." DEN-3 virus was then detected in Costa
Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador, in 1999 in Aruba (Netherlands
Antilles), and in 2000 in Ecuador and Venezuela (see refs. above and
<http://www.paho.org/Spanish/sha/be_v21n4-dengue.htm>). Dr Luiz Jacintho da
Silva, moderator of ProMED-PORT, points out that as the mosquito season in
the southeast of Brazil is now ending, the risk of a large outbreak may be
small this year, but watch out for next year! - Mod.JW
