A horse in Virginia has tested positive for equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1). According to the Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (VDACS), on [Fri 21 Feb 2020], the state veterinarian's office of the VDACS confirmed one horse tested positive for EHV-1. The infected horse was at a boarding stable in Powhatan County. The boarding stable has been placed under quarantine. They say no horse had left the property in at least 2 weeks.

In addition, the VDACS says exposed horses are being monitored twice daily for fever (temperature over 101.50 deg F; 38.6 deg C) and other clinical signs, and no additional Virginia horses have been exposed. There is no cause for alarm concerning the general horse population in Virginia.

EHV-1 is a virus present in the environment and found in most horses all over the world. Horses typically are exposed to the virus at a young age with no serious side effects. A large percentage of horses carry the virus with no clinical signs for the remainder of their lives. Rarely, exposed horses develop the neurologic form of the disease.

Horse owners with concerns should contact their veterinarian. The Equine Disease Communications Center has more information on best practices for disease prevention in horses (http://www.equinediseasecc.org/biosecurity), and VDACS has more information on EHV-1 (http://www.vdacs.virginia.gov/animals-equine-herpes-virus.shtml).

Horse owners also may contact VDACS' Office of Veterinary Services at 804-786-2483.

The New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets reported Barn 29 at Saratoga Harness track was released from respiratory herpesvirus quarantine. The index case and 4 other horses showing clinical signs of respiratory equine herpesvirus have all recovered. No neurologic signs were reported.

Information for this report was provided by the Equine Disease Communication Center (http://www.equinediseasecc.org).

The attending veterinarian has reported as of [Thu 27 Feb 2020] the voluntary quarantine has been lifted on a premises in Washington County, Nebraska, where one horse was confirmed with respiratory equine herpesvirus and 30 other horses were exposed. No other horses became ill and the affected horse has recovered.

[Equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1) is a virus of the family _Herpesviridae_ causing abortion, respiratory disease and occasionally neonatal mortality in horses. Initial spread of EHV-1 by a newly introduced horse through direct and indirect contact can lead to abortion and perinatal infection in up to 70% of a previously unexposed herd. These articles do not tell us if any of these horses was vaccinated.

Biosecurity is extremely important with this disease, as it is highly contagious and spreads easily. There is no vaccine against the neurological form of the disease. Current EHV-1 vaccines might reduce viral shedding but are not protective against the neurologic form of the disease. Implementing routine biosecurity practices is the best way to minimize viral spread, and the best method of disease control is disease prevention.

Primary indications for use of equine herpesvirus vaccines include prevention of EHV-1-induced abortion and reduction of severity and duration of signs of respiratory tract disease (rhinopneumonitis) in foals, weanlings, yearlings, young performance and show horses that are at high risk for exposure. Many horses produce post-vaccinal antibodies against EHV, but the presence of those antibodies is not indicative of protective immunity. Repeated vaccination appears to reduce the frequency and severity of disease and limits the occurrence of abortion storms. As with all forms of equine herpes viral disease, biosecurity management is of primary importance for control of abortion caused by EHV-1 (https://aaep.org/guidelines/vaccination-guidelines/risk-based-vaccination-guidelines/equine-herpesvirus-rhinopneumonitis).
