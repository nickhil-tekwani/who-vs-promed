Another preschooler has been added to the measles death toll in Samoa overnight. The latest death comes the day after 2 children under the age of 5 died of the disease; the toll is now 76.

The Samoan Ministry of Health also confirmed 40 new measles cases were diagnosed in the last 24 hours. The number of new cases and deaths has slowed over the past week, with the Pacific nation's mass vaccination campaign starting to make an impact.

Earlier this month [December 2019], the Samoan Government ordered a nation-wide shutdown of the private and public sector to allow vaccinators to go to every home in their bid to immunise every person in the country.

Latest figure[s] show that 94% of the Samoan population have been vaccinated.

[6] Samoa: perspective
Date: Wed 18 Dec 2019

https://www.vox.com/2019/12/18/21025920/measles-outbreak-2019-samoa


2019 has been a terrible year for measles -- and it's unfortunately ending with a devastating outbreak in Samoa.

On 16 Oct 2019, the ministry of health in the tiny Pacific Island nation sent notice of a measles outbreak within its borders. A month later, the Samoan government declared a state of emergency over the rapidly spreading virus, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). By 10 Dec 2019, Samoa had counted 4819 measles cases, including 70 measles-related deaths.

To put this into perspective, Samoa has a population of around 196 000. In the USA, with more than 1600 times the people, even in a very bad measles year, like 2019, the government recorded 1200 measles cases.

Most of the cases and deaths have occurred in small children, under the age of 5.

In response, Australia has been shipping child-size coffins to bury the dead. Schools across the island have had to shut down over the past couple of months, and public gatherings have been banned. The health system is strained trying to keep up with the onslaught of cases, and while there's no tally on the cost of the outbreak, it's sure to be huge.

So how did measles spiral out of control so quickly? It's pretty simple: because not enough people were vaccinated.

According to the WHO, in 2018, the national rate of coverage for a single dose of the measles-containing vaccine was only 31% -- a halving from about 60% in 2016. This means Samoa has less than one-third of the necessary vaccine coverage rate.

The vaccine-related deaths of 2 children last July [2018] fueled skepticism about the measles shot. There wasn't actually anything wrong with the vaccine. Instead, 2 nurses tainted the measles vaccine by mixing it with muscle relaxant instead of the required doses of water and wound up in prison for manslaughter as a result, the Washington Post reported.

Still, the human error was interpreted by some as a systemic problem with the measles vaccine -- a fear anti-vaccine activists seized upon to sow vaccine doubt.

"The anti-vaccine narrative took off -- but there was another step there," said Saad Omer, a vaccine researcher and director of Yale's Institute for Global Health. At the time of the deaths, the government halted its measles vaccine campaign for 10 months while investigating the tragedy, against the advice of the WHO. "When you pause the program, it increases the number of [people susceptible to measles]," Omer added. So it's no surprise, he added, that measles made inroads when the immunization rate plummeted.

Right now, a mass vaccination campaign is underway, and aid workers and measles experts from other countries, including the USA, have traveled to the island to help.

But what's happening in Samoa is not an isolated case; it's part of a broader trend. Measles vaccine rates have been stagnating globally while measles has surged around the world. In the first 3 months of 2019, there was a 300% rise in measles cases globally over the same period in 2018, according to the WHO. More than 140 000 people died from causes related to the virus in 2018, and cases have increased in all WHO regions since 2017.

The areas that have seen the biggest year-over-year surges include the African region (900%), the Western Pacific region (230%), and the European region (150%); the Democratic Republic of Congo, Liberia, Madagascar, Somalia, and Ukraine were among the countries most affected in 2018.

High-income countries have reported record measles cases, too. In the USA, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced they'd counted the greatest number of measles cases in nearly 3 decades by May [2019], and by October, America nearly lost its measles-free status.

It is thought the highly contagious virus [measles] could have affected those who used Denver International Airport. Three unidentified children are receiving treatment at Children's Hospital Colorado, having contracted the disease while abroad, according to a statement released by the Tri-County Health Department.

The children are related, according to The Denver Post, and they had not received the vaccine for measles, mumps or rubella before falling ill.

[See source URL for locations and times of possible exposure.]

The news comes on the same day health officials in California warned about a potential exposure from patients who travelled through Los Angeles International Airport.

A press release from officials read: "All individuals travelling on the plane with these children or who visited Children's Hospital Colorado during this time frame and are believed to be at risk and are being contacted directly by public health."

Officials at Denver International Airport said they do not know how many people potentially came in contact with the children. Roughly 179 000 people passed through the airport via departing, arriving or connecting flights on 11 Dec 2019, said airport spokeswoman Emily Williams.

Health officials are contacting people who are believed to be at risk for measles, including those who visited Children's Hospital on 12 Dec 2019.

The state's low vaccination rate has come under scrutiny this year [2019], and a bill to make it harder to opt out of such shots was debated by legislators before it failed. Gov. Jared Polis has said he's "pro-choice" when it comes to vaccinations. He said believes the solution to raise the low immunization rate is through education and access rather than eliminating nonmedical exemptions.

Federal health officials said Tuesday [17 Dec 2019] that 3 children recently hospitalized with measles in Colorado traveled from New Zealand to Los Angeles International Airport before arriving in Denver last week.

The warnings in Denver and Los Angeles involve the same airline passengers, said Scott Pauley, spokesman for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The number of Colorado kindergartners getting vaccinated for diseases such as measles and chickenpox dropped again this year [2019], keeping the state at the bottom of the national rankings for childhood immunizations.

Gov. Jared Polis said it's a sign Colorado is headed in the wrong direction, but he thinks the solution is to increase education and access rather than eliminate nonmedical exemptions as other Democratic governors have done.

The governor's recommitment to increasing education about and access to immunizations came the same day the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment released data from the 2018-2019 school year. It showed immunization rates dropping for 4 of the 5 vaccinations required to attend public school:

- Measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) dropped from 88.7% to 87.4%
- Hepatitis B dropped from 92.1% to 90.8%
- Polio dropped from 88.6% to 87.2%
- Chickenpox dropped from 87.7% to 86.5%
- DTaP rose from 88.7% to 90.3%

The CDC already ranked Colorado's MMR vaccination rate the lowest in the country and put the state's overall rate near the bottom of the list.

The measles rates [are] of particular interest because of outbreaks across the country the past 6 months. The national Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported more than 1000 reported measles cases across 28 states -- the highest number since the disease was declared eliminated in 2000.

Almost 90 cases of measles have been reported in a south London borough, with warnings that unvaccinated children could be excluded from schools. Parents in Wandsworth have been warned by Public Health England (PHE) to vaccinate their children following a sudden rise in cases ahead of the Christmas holidays.

Most of the cases have been found in schoolchildren aged between 10 and 19 years old who did not get their full set of shots when they were younger. A number of schools have suffered "large outbreaks" of the disease, according to PHE.

The World Health Organisation declared the UK measles free in 2016, but the country lost this status earlier this year [2019].

Due to the age range of the people affected, there are fears the outbreak may be connected to the now debunked Wakefield report, which wrongly linked the inoculation to autism. Immunisation rates plummeted following publication of the paper, and in 2003-2004 it dropped to just 52% in Wandsworth. Andrew Wakefield was struck off in fallout over his report.

PHE said that 87 cases had been reported from the end of September [2019] and 38 cases had been confirmed as measles after laboratory testing.

More contagious than the Ebola virus, measles is making a deadly global comeback, with devastating outbreaks in all regions. More than 140 000 people died from the vaccine-preventable disease in 2018 -- most of them infants and children under age 5 -- according to new estimates from the World Health Organization (WHO) and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

Potential complications from measles include pneumonia and encephalitis (a swelling of the brain), as well as lifelong disability -- permanent brain damage, blindness and hearing loss. New evidence indicates that contracting measles can have further long-term health impact, damaging the body's immune system for months or even years following infection.

"We've had a safe and effective measles vaccine for over 50 years," said Dr. Robert Linkins, Branch Chief of Accelerated Disease Control and Vaccine Preventable Disease Surveillance at the CDC and Chair of the Measles & Rubella Initiative. "These estimates remind us that every child everywhere needs -- and deserves -- this lifesaving vaccine."

As one of the founders of the Measles & Rubella Initiative, UNICEF works with partners to vaccinate vulnerable children all over the world, including conflict zones. In the first 8 months of 2019, UNICEF reached 28.9 million children with measles vaccines.
