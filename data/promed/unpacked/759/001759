[3] American Samoa: schools closed
Date: Sun 8 Dec 2019, 10:34 AM SGT

The government of American Samoa declared that the United States territory has an outbreak of measles, a move that will lead to the closure of public schools starting on [Mon 9 Dec 2019] and a ban on gatherings in parks.

In its announcement on [Fri 6 Dec 2019] of the measles outbreak, the government said the territory had 9 cases of the disease; 5 of those infected had been travelling outside the territory.

As for the other 4 people who tested positive for measles, "we're suspecting that is local transmission - meaning that it's most likely that some of these travellers did transmit the measles virus to them, causing them to be sick," Health Department Epidemiologist Dr. Aifili John Tufa said. Dr. Tufa said in a television broadcast that samples from those infected were sent to Hawaii for testing and the results came back on [Thu 5 Dec 2019], resulting in the move to let the public know that "we are currently in the state of emergency" and a "measles outbreak".

In the neighbouring independent nation of Samoa, more than 60 people have died, mostly children, from the measles, and more than 4000 were infected since the outbreak started in mid-October [2019], health officials said.

American Samoa will get a measles vaccine shipment from the US Centres for Disease Control and Protection on [Mon 9 Dec 2019], Dr. Tufa said.

Data presented by health officials early this week during a Cabinet meeting showed a 99.7% vaccination rate for mumps, measles and rubella in the territory, officials said. But Dr. Tufa said that more needs to be done to up the rate for the one to 5 year age group, which is currently at 84.7%. "The number one way to stop the spread of measles is to immunise," he said.

The developments in American Samoa came after dozens of Hawaii healthcare workers returned to their homes across the state after voluntarily providing measles vaccinations to thousands of residents of the independent nation of Samoa, officials said.

A team of 76 healthcare workers and support staff went to Samoa for a 2-day medical mission to ensure residents there were immunised from the highly contagious virus, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. "You have scores of people dying, and the society is paralysed," said Honolulu surgeon Paulus Tsai. "Basically life has come to a standstill for the island."

Samoa declared a state of emergency and complete shutdown of government and business operations while vaccination teams searched for residents susceptible to the disease, health officials said.

Global measles resurgence
-------------------------
Since 2017, a global resurgence of measles cases has been affecting all regions of the world. In global immunization surveys, coverage for the 2nd dose of measles-containing vaccine (MCV2) was 69%, with significant variability between regions. In the Asia Pacific region, outbreaks and clusters of measles cases are being reported from countries where measles has been eliminated, including Australia, Japan, New Zealand, Republic of Korea, as well as higher incidence in endemic countries such as Lao PDR, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Viet Nam.

To date, Samoa, Tonga, Fiji, and American Samoa have reported measles cases. The outbreaks in Samoa and Tonga are caused by the D8 strain (genotype) of measles virus. Measles vaccine coverage varies in Pacific island countries and areas, ranging from 31% in Samoa to 99% in the Cook Islands, Nauru, and Niue.

Country situation overview
--------------------------
Samoa
-----

- As of [6 Dec 2019], the MoH confirms a total of 4357 cases with 140 new cases reported within the last 24 hours. Of all measles cases 52% (2263) are children aged below 5 years.

Ipswich City Council will be running free measles vaccination clinics, even for those without a Medicare card, in response to eight confirmed cases in Ipswich in the past month.

West Moreton Health public health physician Dr. Vicki Slinko said staff has been working for the past few weeks to trace all those who may have been exposed to measles to try to prevent the disease and test all potential measles cases early to contain the infection.
