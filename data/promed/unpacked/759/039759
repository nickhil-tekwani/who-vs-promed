The local health authorities have been worried for the past few days because of a community death in Temessadou Bokeh, in the Gueckedou prefecture. According to a reliable source at the National Health Security Agency, an initial laboratory analysis revealed Marburg viral hemorrhagic fever, a severe disease believed to be related to the Ebola virus and the Lassa fever. It is difficult to confirm this lead for the time being according to the prefectural director of health who was reached by phone.

Local sources say a 2nd sample was taken from the deceased in the village to determine the exact nature of the illness. The samples taken have been sent to Conakry and an investigation team will be deployed this Friday [6 Aug 2021] in the village to determine the origin of the disease.

[This report provides no information about this case other than the death. No symptoms are given nor a description of the locality where the disease was acquired. Results of the follow up tests are awaited with interest. If confirmed, this will be the 1st report of Marburg disease in Guinea that ProMED has posted. There have been several reports of Marburg virus infections in East Africa and a there was a recent report from Sierra Leone in West Africa where an Angola-like Marburg virus was isolated for the 1st time in West Africa from 5 Egyptian rousette bats (_Rousettus aegyptiacus_) (ref: Nat Commun. 2020; 11:510. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-14327-8, see Marburg virus disease - Sierra Leone: bat 20200125.6916732).

The above report was confirmed by an information release by the national Agency for Health Security of the Ministry of Health, but this too provided no additional information (http://lexpressguinee.com/fichiers/blog16-999.php?pseudo=rub2&code=calb14766&langue=fr#.YQ6cIoab9KA.twitter in French). - Mod.TY
