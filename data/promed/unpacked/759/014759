Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) was confirmed in a 52 year old
woman who lives in the Petrusburg area in the Free State Province, South
Africa, on a cattle farm situated between Bloemfontein and Kimberley.
The patient presented with acute onset of fever, arthralgia, epigastric
pain, and vomiting. There was a history of a _Hyalomma_ tick being removed
from her leg 9 days before the onset of illness. Laboratory testing
demonstrated marked thrombocytopenia and increased hepatic transaminases.
The diagnosis of CCHF was confirmed by the Special Pathogens Unit at the
National Institute for Communicable Diseases in Johannesburg by detection
of CCHF viral nucleic acid using RT-PCR (reverse transcriptase polymerase
chain reaction) on specimens taken on day 8 of the illness.
Despite intensive care, the patient died. No secondary cases have been
reported in contacts to date. This is the 1st laboratory-confirmed case of
CCHF from South Africa in 2006.
Typically CCHF resulting from a bite by an infected tick has a very short
incubation period -- usually 1-3 days. In this respect, the history of tick
exposure 9 days prior to the onset of illness in this patient as a source
of CCHF virus infection would be unusual. However, the patient lived in an
area where _Hyalomma_ ticks are prevalent and she might have been
subsequently exposed to an infected tick.
